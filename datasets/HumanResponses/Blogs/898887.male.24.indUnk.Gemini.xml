         1.&nbsp; I was born on June 6, 1980 at St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore, MD.    2.&nbsp; I am a "love child."    3.&nbsp; I found this out when I was 18.    4.&nbsp; My mother dressed me like a girl when I was 3 for Halloween.    5.&nbsp; I looked positively smashing.    6.&nbsp; My natural eye color is Hazel but I wear Blue contacts.    7.&nbsp; My natural hair color is dark brown but it hasn't been that way since I was 13.    8.&nbsp; In elementary, junior, and high school I only had female friends.    9.&nbsp; It made all the other guys at school jealous.    10.&nbsp; I graduated high school with a 3.9 GPA.    11.&nbsp; As for college I haven't graduated yet.    12.&nbsp; I will within the next 2 years.    13.&nbsp; I met one of my best friends my first day of English 101.    14.&nbsp; Her name is Amanda.    15.&nbsp; I don't keep many friends.    16.&nbsp; I can name them on one hand.    17.&nbsp; I have never been to a strip club that had women stripping.    18.&nbsp; My first strip club was in Washington D.C.in 2004&nbsp;and it was men stripping.    19.&nbsp; I did not enjoy it.    20.&nbsp; One of my favorite songs is "Loving You" by Minnie Ripperton.    21.&nbsp; I play it at work when people irk me.    22.&nbsp; My first kiss was with a guy named Chris.    23.&nbsp; I was 11 years old.    24.&nbsp; He also took my virginity.    25.&nbsp; I have no clue where Chris is now.    26.&nbsp; I have kissed more lesbians than I have men.    27.&nbsp; I used to cyber everynight.    28.&nbsp; I despise it now.    29.&nbsp; I used to be an alcoholic.    30.&nbsp; I rarely drink now.    31.&nbsp; I have had two back surgeries.    32.&nbsp; I am still in debt from them.    33.&nbsp; I drive a Mercedes Benz.    34.&nbsp; I am still in debt from it.    35.&nbsp; I have a very good imagination.    36.&nbsp; However, I rarely remember my dreams.    37.&nbsp; My favorite color is red.    38.&nbsp; Sometimes I see in this color.    39.&nbsp; I have a pet rat.    40.&nbsp; Her name is Baby Girl aka The Rat.    41.&nbsp; I don't eat red meat, pork, or seafood.    42.&nbsp; Not because I can't just because I don't want to.    43.&nbsp; I don't like tomatoes.    44.&nbsp; I love spaghetti sauce.    45.&nbsp; My favorite potato chips are dill and ketchup.    46.&nbsp; My favorite drink is water.    47.&nbsp; I used to pretend I was a fashion model.    48.&nbsp; I still do to this day.    49.&nbsp; I despise bugs with the exception of lady bugs and one ant.    50.&nbsp; I have over 400 movies.    51.&nbsp; I use them to escape.    52.&nbsp; My favorite movie is "Steel Magnolias."    53.&nbsp; Second is "interview with the Vampire."    54.&nbsp; I suffer from insomnia.    55.&nbsp; I drink NyQuil daily to sleep.    56.&nbsp; I love the night.    57.&nbsp; But hate the dark.    58.&nbsp; I have always wanted to be a vampire.    59.&nbsp; Or would just settle for their beauty and sharp teeth.    60.&nbsp; I can knit, crochet, and do needle point.    61.&nbsp; I've yet to finish a project.    62.&nbsp; I named my dog Laquita.    63.&nbsp; She is a lesbian.    64.&nbsp; I hate cutting my fingernails.    65.&nbsp; Sometimes I think I have mutiple personalities.    66.&nbsp; But then he says I don't.    67.&nbsp; I used to lie for the fun of it.    68.&nbsp; I am a Gemini.    69.&nbsp; This is my favorite number.    70.&nbsp; Dragqueens are scary to me.    71.&nbsp; I have dressed in drag three times.    72.&nbsp; My favorite place is Hawaii.    73.&nbsp; I want to go back soon.    74.&nbsp; I am obsessed with Italian and Egyptian history.    75.&nbsp; I've yet to be in either place.    76.&nbsp; My favorite city is New York.    77.&nbsp; I'm terrified of heights.    78.&nbsp; I've been to the top of the Empire State Building.    79.&nbsp; I have met Ludacris.    80.&nbsp; I think he is cute and tiny.    81.&nbsp; I am very artistic.    82.&nbsp; I only draw when I hurt.    83.&nbsp; I have 10 tattooes.    84.&nbsp; One is dedicated "In Memory of Aaliyah."    85.&nbsp; My favorite song is "Crush" by Dave Matthews Band.    86.&nbsp; I'm not afraid of death.    87.&nbsp; I'm more afraid of living.    88.&nbsp; I have cut my wrists on several occassions.    89.&nbsp; Just to know that I'm human.    90.&nbsp; I think hookers rock.    91.&nbsp; I used to talk to them when I lived in Baltimore.    92.&nbsp; I sleep with a nightlight.    93.&nbsp; Even in the daytime.    94.&nbsp; I don't do drugs.    95.&nbsp; At least since 2003.    96.&nbsp; I love reading about other people's lives.    97.&nbsp; Sometimes I wish I had theirs.    98.&nbsp; I don't know what the future holds for me.    99.&nbsp; I know you don't either.    100.&nbsp; I'm to be continued.

      Well I've yet to head out to work yet!  I had to come back and share somemore ideas.  Has anyone ever told you that you needed an attitude adjustment?  Well I've heard that tons of times.  You can't just hit the red button that says "attitude on/off."  If we could we would all be like Sally Struthers "Do you need more money?"  or like Barney on ecstacy!  "Super de dooper" Gotta go being called away to down loading heaven!

      Well I had a migrane...as soon as I got up!  What's up with that?  How do you sleep and wake up with a headache?  Like you had trauma to the head in a dream.  Picture it:  I running after one of those baywatch babes (you know that run boobs flop up and down and they are in slow motion) and I trip on a sand castle and hit my head on a boulder.  That's what caused my migrane.  I knew I could figure it out.  Whatever.  I just love music!!  It is like so musical.  I love all types of music.  Yes I can appreciate almost any type of music.  I love R&B, Rap, Go-Go, Big band, Classical, Alternative, Ska, and a little bit er country!  I just like jam out in the car...it's like I have my own club that follows me wherever I go.  I just jam!  Jammy Jam to Jams in the Jeep!  All I need is a strobe light and a disco ball!  Curb side service would never be the same.  Insta-club or crubb like Khia says in My Neck My Back.  I do have rythm though for a white guy.  Hello ask all my friends I can break it down to like anything.  I'm the freak in freaky!  What up Amanda!  Remember the cage at Exhale....whoooohooo!  I know April and Billy do.* (*They are my closest friends outside of work).  Wouldn't it be great if we could like dance at work...instead of a spa they should have a dance floor to relieve our stress.  I'd be so thin!  Go Paul Go Paul it's your birthday!  Shake what yo mama gave ya!  Big Booty Boy hump wit it!  What up Keeva!  I feel like today is a shout out day.  Not a shout it out day like the detergent but a "hey I have to say hello to everybody because I feel like it" day.  I feel like puky today!  The migrane is like throbbing trying to come back I know it.  I can feel it knocking on my brian.  Mr. Migrane:  Knock...knock!  Me:  No you just went away!  Why do you have to visit twice in the same day?  Mr. Migrane:  Because I have to meet my quota it's the last day of the month.  Two migranes a month.  Me:  Oh like the police quota!  I get it...go ahead come again!  I don't want you to be unemployed.  IBPROFIN time!  I think that I have become immune to any type of headache, backache, nerve ache, ass ache, toenail ache, invisible ache, fake ache because I used to pop like five hundred pills a day before I had back surgery!  I can't believe how much I can write.  It's amazing!  Well I'll write later again tonight if I feel better I feel the head ache coming back.  Later to all the shout out peoples of the day!!  R EV WAH! (or however it's spelled)!  Hello I'm not French!

      Hello again.  I'll have to make this a short entry because I'm tired and have to finish watching gone with the wind.  I want to send a shout out to all my people at work.  I know that times get rough and we all get on each other's nerves but I'm hoping that we all share the commom bond of friendship.  I enjoy everyone I work with though at times I feel like I can't take anymore.  It's more or less the job not the people.  Lord this is a twist compared to what I usually write.  I have a special message for certain people at my work that I would like to share with whom ever reads my journal.   Ms. Pat :  You are just like a mom or grandma to me.  I love your laugh.  It could charm the smarts right out of a person.   Monique :  You are the bomb baby!  You are the light at the end of the tunnel when my day has gone bad!  You prove laughter is the best medicine.   Laura :  While we really didn't get along too well at the beginning I really have grown to adore you.  Your quirky sense of humor and the ability to respect me even when I don't need to be respected.   Susan :  You know more than anyone how appreciative I am of you.  You keep me in line and my nose clean (this is figurative not a literal statement.  A tough but loving person.   Samantha :  Whoa girl!  Lots of love for you.  You as well keep me in the right state of mind.  You are a shoulder I can lean on whenever I feel the need...thanks!!   Susie :  Can we say "Big little Mermaid"...well I shouldn't but I will.  You are the knowledge that I can run to if I ever have a question.  You hold a lot more knowledge than most people do.   Constance :  Love for you madly.  You try to get me smilin everyday.  You try to point out the best in me.  Would kill for your smile.   Josetta :  A constant reminder of the sassyness in me.  You are hiliarous.  "Oh I know they didn't" is the only thing I think of when I think of you...he...he...he!   Denise :  You are the constant reminder of me and who I am.  Funny...serious...but always willing to adapt to the situation.  Are you sure we aren't twins?  I know that all of this sounds corny but I'm trying to look for the good in everyone.  Hope that if you view my journal you get a smile on your face because that's why I'm here on earth.  At least I think that's why.  To keep people smiling!  I hope we can all learn to find the little things that make each of us unique and work from there.  But anyways!  Don't you ever wish that you could be wisked away to some foreign place!  I do.  I want to go back to Hawaii...shut up it's not foreign but close enough.  I also wish that there were more food choices.  I'm running out of ideas on what to eat.  Hello...fat here...have tried almost everything that's eatable*.  (*eatable=is now a word if it wasn't before...combines eat and table so it's extra special).  Well I've gotta go watch Gone With the Wind!  Love that movie!  No stories from the Twilight Phone tonite...guess the wires have relocated to someone else's phone.  Until next time when my uncle is not sleeping in the basement and I can be in a more "to infinity and beyond" mood.  That is for you  Barb !  In Memory of Robbie.  Happy birthday Bert...it's only two days away!  And I leave you with a person who demonstrates courage and strength to no end!

      Hello again.  I have this burning issue to discuss tonight.  So my mother accidently washed my $300 dollar Ralph Lauren down comforter and it mildewed because she accidently left it in the washer.  All is forgiven.  I'm still holding on to the time she bleached my $100 orange Kenneth Cole top that I waited forever to get.  But anyway, I've decided to learn from this accident and provide everyone with information regarding the care of a goose or geese.  Care Rules: 1)don't leave your goose in the washer for like three days...he will mildew.  Feathers cannot lose that raunchy smell.  2)if you have a goose make sure that he is not named Ralph or Lauren because that can only mean that the recovery bill that you may have to pay will be expense...say $300 3)never leave your goose unattended...he may come around to bite you in the ass. 4)always remember to correct your goose with a wire hanger...yes a wire hanger.  He will be very afraid and never disobey you again.* (*Disclaimer:  Due to the use of wire hangers any and all references may invoke the spirit of Joan Crawford leading to the death of the goose by reason of wire beating)  That is all the care instructions that I have.  Anyway!  Today Constance...a friend of mine...hello Constance...tells me that I am losing weight in my face.  I think that I may have something wrong with me.  Generally when I eat the result is 10lbs that are well deserved.  What is up?  Can't a fat person get a little fatter.  Kidding.  Moving on to more important matters is that of the dreaded Twilight phone.  Yes it has come back to haunt me again.  Last night I forgot to tell you (like I know who all the you's are out there) that I had a strange call from this German Lady.  The call went something like this...here we go!  Me:  Hello and thank you for calling ********...this is Paul how may I help you?  German Lady:  Oh yes it's past twelve o'clock isn't it?  Me:  Yeah!  It's like 12:38am.  German Lady:  That means it is now Saturday right?  Me:  I was always told that it turned the next day at midnight.  German Lady:  Well thanks for clarifying that for me...the next day will be Sunday right?  Me:  Yeah!  Saturday is before Sunday.  Goodbye!  WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SAY:  Don't you own a clock?  calendar? something that tells you what day it is?  Well then write in on your forehead backwards and look in a mirror...that is if you can see through the cloud of stupid you've created.  Have a great Saturday at 12:38am!  Goodbye!  Hello get a clue!  Is it just me or does the planet contain a virus that infects people who call catalog phone numbers?  It's like the lines at work have relocated to a new position and all calls that require a psychiatrist come directly to me!!  Man what I would do for the money they make!  Instead of the truth.com always advertising about smoking killing people they need to do some work on stupid people talking smarter people to death.  Here is the ad logo:  Everyday stupid are dialing.  Its become a plague.  Be afraid to answer your phone.  That about covers it!!  Stupid+phone=death!!  I wish that the opening messages of all of our clients said:  Thank you for calling ****** if you are stupid, hard of hearing, have a complaint, or are just calling in for no reason please press flash on your phone to be directed to the appropriate location.  Where are they directed...yep you guessed it to the dial tone!!  I bet that people would do it!!  Well anywho I need to leave and take a bath/shower to perk up a little more to watch Gone With the Wind!!  Until tomorrow!!  Love, peace and hair grease!!  Paul

      Hello again!  I only have like twenty minutes before I have to get ready for work.  Today should be an easy day....acting supervisor on weekends.  I feel that I should get paid more because hello I'm the actor.  Okay here is the question for the day.  Have you ever wondered if there is some god or demon that exists purely to torture you.  Well I think that there is.  The god or demon that likes to torture me is the God of "Putsalotofpressure."  He awakens almost everyday to put massive amounts of pressure on me so that I just want to scream or go take a relaxing hot shower.  But then there is the God of the Twilight Phone who knows that I am on the phone all day at work and that the only time I have off the phone is when I am at home, in bed, or driving.  Well he is starting to infect everything.  I try to get enough sleep for the entire nation everynight even though it doesn't work out that way.  And damned it here comes the God of the Twilight Phone.  Here is a typical situation with twilight phone outside of work...ready..go!  Me:  ZZzZZzz  Phone:  Ring...ring...ring...ring...ring  Me: Oh man.  Who is calling?  Hello?  Phone:  Hi this is Britney from AT&T and I was just....  Me:  Excuse me I didn't ask for your service goodbye.  You know the people that do outbound calling should really remember call during 9am-5pm...cause that's when everyone is at work.  But I will get like four hundred calls a day.  One time I actually counted the amount of calls that came in when I was dead tired 77 calls in like four hours.  Hello!!  So I no have the phones hidden throughout the house and my ringer is turned off.  Never with wire hangers...rememeber that piece of advice.  Joan Crawford?  You know Mommy Dearest?  Well that is today's moral of the whole damned story.  Never with wire hangers.  Reason one:  never use a wire hanger to unlock you car doors...it will only lead to a broke lock.  Reason Two:  Don't let you kids play with wire hangers...will lead to a huge doctor's bill for having to get it out of the child's mouth  Reason Three or The only other reason I could think of:  Don't use wire hangers on clothing 1) may rust and cause rust spots on your clothing 2) can easily snag that expensive shirt or pants 3) just because and 4) Joan Crawford will yell at you "Never with wire hangers...never...never!"  Hey it could happen!!  Well gotta go fix some lunch in 6 mins to head of to work!!  Enjoy the day or what's left of it!  Toodle Fanoodle!!  Paul

      Well it is like 2:26 a.m. and I am still on the computer.  Have you ever wondered if the education system is defunct.  Like bankrupt?  All the teachers are just government employees who act like they know what they are doing.  Well I do.  I talk to at least 80 people a day and my Lord do most of them seem like they crawled right out of "Deliverence."  Uh..duh...what?  Hello check your damn hearing aid.  Is the battery on low or has it modeled to your brain and caused a chemical imbalance shifting you to side "stupid."  Whatever.  I came up with this new quote.  Forrest Gump always seem to inspire me out of the blue....here it goes.  "Sex is like a box of chocolates...you keep pushing until you get a cherry."  Whoa...hold up that is nasty.  But wait...what is that?  Applause coming from the rafters!  Score one for Paul!  Sometimes I think that I am crazy and then I just remember that everyone has a bit of craziness to them.  Hello Tricia!!  Were do we work!!  You have to be insane to actually suppport that.  Most of the people we (me and Tricia) work with are these old 90 year old half breathing, wrinkled, hard of hearing, can't talk, can't remember elderly people.  Hey I'll be there one day.  But I realize that I don't want to make people suffer that work at a call center so I'll shop at WalMart if I need anything.  Here is a quick adventure of the twilight phone.  Me:  What was that again?  Mrs. Customer:  I noticed that since I've been using your product that the flax seed is making my breasts firmer and bigger.  What do you think could be causing that?  Me:  I don't know ma'am...let me check for you.  WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SAY:  Listen here ma'am you are like older than the world you should be glad that your boobs are regaining the 20 yr. old placement.  Maybe the flax is making your skin tighter.  Be thankful and keep using the flax maybe you'll end up in your 20's again.  Don't question what can't be answered by a man.  Especially one who doesn't know anything about flax seed and its effect on the female breast.  Can you say whoa!  That was an actual call minus what I really wanted to say.  That is the first adventure of many to come from the "Twilight phone."  Check back later for reoccuring episodes.  Later!!

      Hello my peeps!  What's up, down, or all around?  It has been a pretty good weekend.  Desi is now back with me full time...thanks be to God!  I really enjoy working with her because it makes the time not drag by so slow.  She is lookin good too...her hair is faboo!  I'm glad that her surgery turned out good...hopefully she will be set for life.  Anywho April and I went to the kingdom of Wally World last night.  I did some Christmas shopping and got five people done.  I spent like 350 dollars on just five people but hey it's Christmas.  I just love Christmas...don't you?  You get that feeling of like everything is peaceful or something.  I really don't know what I want for Christmas.  Either a plane ticket to see Erin in Tacoma or a plane ticket to see my friend Tina in Florida.  (If you read this Erin I really think Tina needs to see some of her friends right now...no offense.)  Tina is doing really good her voice is getting back to the bubbly side of her personality.  I hope that she is mentally being strong for the sake of herself and her friends.  She yelled at me though on Saturday at work for not emailing her yet...as if!  Tina you know I've been really busy girl!  You went to college and worked at the same time.  I thought you would wind up insane.  But you haven't so far.  Desi just popped in with my rootbeer.  I really don't like rootbeer that much but I've been wanting it lately.  Desi was telling me about this website tonight called s**tlovers.com where people are obsessed with you guessed it...poo!  How nasty is that?  I don't even want to know...moving on...!  I really don't have much else to add tonight except that I once again am tired.  So I'll catch ya'll later!  Boo to the people obsessed with poo!  Paul

      So I've decided that I want to be a DJ Poet if my stint as a lawyer doesn't work out.  Here is today's Improv Poetry:  Ode to my Munchichi  Oh I love you munchichi You know you are soft and cuddly  You look like a rat that's on crack In the 80's you were a mack  Brown, white, pink, and blue Funky colors get a clue  Fuzzy and chunky  You resembled a monkey  Angel loves you so much Why don't the two of you do lunch  I'd beat you with a wire hanger Stuff you in my jeep wrangler  You tried to bite me what's up that? Almost made me have a heart attack  You may go bald one of these's days Get your weave a Mr. Rays  You are a little fat Use slim fast to rid of that  You, Angel and me Should get together and get some tea  Don't try to beat us it will be a miss Soft and cuddly with a twis'  We would surely have a ball Come on and give us a call  We will welcome you with open arm Try to bite us we will seek harm  We love you oh yes we do Try to bite us will we sue   I am a lawyer yes I am I could turn you into spam  Sound off one two three four Always will an open door

      Hello my people!  How are you all doing?  Hopefully everyone is safe and sound.  So last night was an experience.  April, Paul, and I (Paul II) went to Denny's to see Paul's man and then we went to Wally World to take pictures.  It was a blast!  Woohoo!  I wanted to play product patrol but didn't have time.  If you don't know what product patrol is it is when you put random items in other shopper's carts...like condoms...ky jelly...panty hose!  It is faboo!  I have a test in English to study for and it is being the big pain in the butt!  I hope I do alright I want a B on the test but who knows!  I am in one of those moods where I can't think of anything really funny.  What is up with that?  Hello I am the King of Comedy...yes the original King of Comedy!  Congrats go out to Daria in Orange...her daughter had a baby...Cloe Gabriel weighing in at 7lbs. 10ounces!  Go Daria!  Anyway if I think of anything that will make me the King of Comedy for the night I'll add somemore!  Asta lawaygo to the cho cho!  Paul

      I have another improv poem for you today...this is dedicated to Erin.   Ode to Icky Bug   You are so ugly and funky Your body seems kind of chunky.  You have way to many legs that wave Thank God you don't have to shave.  You scared the living shit out of me and Erin I need a pet to eat you say a heron.  You are the fastest bug I've seen I kill you with some oxy-clean.  Maybe you just lived with that lesbian You should go away back to plant Respian.  Why did you have to migrate icky bug Why do I have to kill you with a slug?  You are the debil that is true You should be locked up in the zoo.  But fond memories Erin and I will share Of the day we met icky bug on the stair.  Ta Da!  Love ya Erin

      So guess what?  Well guess?  Hello take an effin guess?  Anyway I got a 99% on my law exam!  I am the top notch b'otch!  So anyway I get a letter saying that I am past due on a medical bill.  Whatever I pay my bills.  I had to not go to school to take care of this.  But I overslept to until like 2pm.  They are greedy evil troll whores who work at the hospital.  Now I am on a payment plan and have to pay interest to the billing trolls they use at the hospital because they are too cheap to send out a bill each month at the hospital.  I have to pay some company that is somehow crackwhore troll related MCS...they are a third party billing company.  How come they get to get monies and aren't even involved.  I didn't agree to be paying another company for my surgery.  Show me the monies.  Shit...I'll send my own self a bill for 1.5% interest a month.  But get over it Paul it must be paid.  Sick em'...sick em'...sick em' and kill em' Joan Crawford.....beat them with wire money...never with wire money.  I want to write you a po em' about Joan.  I will improv.   Wire Hangers are the bomb   Joan Joan you were the best You could beat with a hanger and past the test.  Never with a wire hanger is all I remember Like a winter memory in December.  Comet Cleanser was your fav Wire dancer at a rav.  Bondage baby was your thing Tying people up with string.  Though crazy you had been Wire hangers were your sin.  Tried to blame it on the maid You seriously needed to be laid.  Anger anger is all we saw Hoping you would get lock jaw.  Everyday a little sicker You really needed a coochie licker.  Frustrated with the idea of sex Caused this wire hanger hex.  You should have gotten it on much sooner Did it to you reached the lunar.  Then all would have been good No wire hangers just fire wood.  A little to late is all there is to say Wire hangers are a hell to pay.  Don't come back to visit that's too much Bomb wire hanger woman go to lunch.  Ta da!  I think it is faboo!  Well later to Joan and K.C. and the Sunshine jelly!  Bye bye homefry!  Paul

      So today Amanda and I go to class and of course it is extra credit day so we had to write a poem in the style of Walt Whittman that was a catagorizing poem.  Like catagorizing people, jobs, flowers...you get the picture.  Amanda did different types of alcohol...I did sexual positions!  I'm sure to get an A from Professor Sexy Poetry.  Here is my poem   Their Positions   The woman arches her back like a bridge, The man's arms reach to be her support, The two come together on bent knee.  He is able to observe her body like a long road, She is blinded facing away from the eyes, The mounds are split from behind with a shovel.  She is out stretched but upside down, His hands surround her protecting her crown, He one way and she the other, F&*%ing each other without a cover.  She switches the gear with a thrust, He remains calm looking up to her bust, She is in control to her he must trust.  He pumps and thrusts as on a mission, This is not her favorite position, To be folded like a pretzel is her condition.  He sat still upon the leather, Her tongue she used as a feather, A brewing load forecasted the weather.  Her mouth was slowly spread, His tongue awaiting to tread, Upon her newly shaven bed.  She held her two curves together, He felt the warmth of a sweater, No other mounds could have been done better.  His digits slipped below the belt, A rush of moisture is all she felt, One plus two they began to melt.  Which one to choose was the decision, To determine their position.  Well I know that it is really naughty but Amanda and I think that it is a pretty cool poem.  Let me know what you think!  Later in latex!  Paul

      Well it has been quite sometime that I have written.  I have been really busy.  Work..work...work...college...college...college!  I got my hair dyed though.  It is now black with red highlights.  Can you say hello to Mr. Fire Engine Red?  I went shopping with Constance is the local late breaking news!!  I had so much fun spoiling myself with whatever I wanted.  I need to do that more often just to make sure that I remember what it is like to be spoiled.  I bought tons of clothes! From old navy, to southpole, to sean jean!  It was FAABOO! Woohoo!  The best thing that I bought though was my Aaliyah Calendar!!  It is fabulous!  My favorite picture is my birthday month of June.  I love that!  It is the bestest of ever if there was ever the bestest of ever for a calendar!  I haven't gotten my exam back in law class even though I know that I was the bomb diggidty on the test.  Work has been the biz'otch.  Desi has returned and I am so siked!  I actually have someone to help take care of the stress that I've had doing everything by myself.  I am so greatful that she is back because it will make the weekends more enjoyable!  I went out last night to Sarah P's house!  Can I get a whoa now!  I had a blast!  Hiccup...hiccup!  I am sure that you will get what I am saying if you were there!  T or D?  Caroline, Constance, Sarah?  Which one will it be?  You know that I am the bomb at getting people to use their passes!  I am the champion!  I have to admit something though.  I really enjoyed the ear fondling.  More than I thought I would.  You...and if you can remember who you is get an A+ in the ear fondling department.  Well I have to go because I am on a time limit!  Talk to you later when I actually have time to talk.  Bye bye to my girls that are fly fly!  Paul

      Guess what my people?  I aced that effin exam.  Excuse the french but I am so beyond proud.  I think I got at least a 95%!  Go smart tubby boy!  You da bomb boy!  I sound so vain!  Maybe that's because I am.  Vanity is a privilege that has to be mastered.  You have to have a reason to be vain and I do.  I love myself is the reasoning behind that!  Case in point....me+perfection=vanity!  I am so not perfect but I'm the closest thing that there is.  Ha...ha...ha!!  Well work has been the b'otch of the week besides have to learn 140 law terms and the civil litigations process.  The weekend would have been fabulous but guess what the god of "putsalotofpressure" came to visit and man he was not in good mood.  He is such a ass master as Erin would put it.  Not God but the ficticious god.  "I felt impotent and out of control which I really hate" from Clueless the movie!  That was the quote for the weekend.  I had a panic attack three days in a row!  Can you say "Calm down Paul it will be okay.?"  Okay this ass master and do the exam studying for me and have the service levels where they need to be!  Poof your wish has been granted.  Wouldn't that be wonderful and while your at it ass master genie please but my $472.52 jeep payment on tab and you pay the bill!  I wish I was Alladin except I would not go for Jasmine because she would cause me to waste my wishes on getting her.  Get over it Alladin once you have everything that you want all the women will come flocking to you.  Can I get Keeva to magically appear and say "You's a golddigger!"  Keeva is my ghetto queen.  She is not really from the ghetto but she keeps the piece of ghetto she has in me that I have had since I lived in Baltimore.  Shout out to Keeva!!!  A bowl and a margarita is all I have to say...and 8 bags girl 8 bags of hair!  Remember to tell the person when you get your hair did that it is 8 bags not five.  She really messed you up last time!  Evil whore!  What do beauticians think that they can just weave someone's hair into looking bad and get away with it?  Listen here Wild Weaver Woman you's need to but somemore up in my head.  Lookin all gappy and shiznet!  Keeva I luv you!  They need to come out with a new series on t.v.  "When weavers go wrong"  Cause some of these white women be gettin some messed up junks in there heads!  You are white you have enough hair!  And to my black queens who I love to death keep it real girl.  If he can't appreciate what you got he tryin to make up for somethin he ain't got!  The more he wants from you the more he is lacking!  I appreciate that you look good with the weaves and all but keep it real beauty comes and all shapes and sizes!  And even though sometimes you are blinded and thinkin "damn" they need to go hide in a cave they still have an aspect that is beautiful on the inside!  To all my beautiful women black, white, puertican, jamacian, japanese, spanish, french, germany....and all other countries keep it real!  Fake titties ain't gonna get you nothin but a fat ass when they saline leaks and falls straight to your ass.  Fake hair may look good but it will end up given you some funky itch that won't go away.  Fake lips will only lead to not being able to talk or eat because they usually look like two pigs tryin to escape the blanket from a pig in the blanket.  Lypo suction is just plain funky...it will all come back and with avengence!  Well gotta go get my girl Constance to have an escapade!  See ya to a diva named Nekeeva! (That's Keeva's real name)!  Paul

      Okay so I only have like five minutes to write but I think that that is better than nothing.  Today is the big test day Constance.  I appreciate you helping me with my studying!  I'm gonna kick some big flubbery ass on this test or kick my big flubbery ass if I don't do good.  I haven't been writing because I have been really busy studying and working!  By the time I get home it has been like 1:30am in the mornin'!  My uncle is staying with us permanetly now so I can't really access the computer.  I'm seriously thinking about moving it to my room!  After all the tower is on my credit card!!  All $1100.00 just for the friggin tower!  Any ways!  I am really nervous and did not sleep good last night!  I kept on trying to run through all these legal terms in my head to make sure I know what I'm talking about!  It was like a nightmare of being stuck in Law and Order!!!  Dun..dun.dun!  You know that little thingy Tricia!  Well I actually thought of it last night!  For all of you who don't know and probably don't care I am a Political Science major with a minor in Graphic Design!  Woohoo!  Sounds real fun until I actually go to class!  Moving on I have to go get a shower and smell so fresh and so clean clean!  Cause ain't nobody dope as me...I'm just so versatile...so fresh and so clean clean!  Damn I think I'm so sexy!  I just so versatile!  He...he!  Adios pacaco! Until later today after the exam!

      So...I really have to get ready for work but I figured since I didn't write last night I would hurry up and do it now...not that you all aren't important or anything but I had to make a flower arrangement for Ms. Pat so I got up at 12 and didn't go to bed until 6AM...I'm lacking in the sleep department.  The flower arrangement turned out really pretty my mother told me she was going to take it hostage.  I told her that Ms. Pat could probably kick her booty.  I swear I just want a vacation.  I am supposed to go to Washington state this December to visit my friend Erin but I have to find out if I can get off...work that is.!!! Dirty dirty dirty!  You all need to get some febreeze to spray in your heads.  Lord it is hard to talk to someone on yahoo instant message and write in the journal.  I'll come back tonight I have a story about the twilight phone but don't have enough time to type all of it out!  I will leave you with Munchichi Munchichi so soft and cuddlely!  Later Terminator!

      So I am retarded...right?  I went to post what was supposed to be my last entry for the night and hit sign-out!  Friggin tard'!  Get a grip Paul!  Anyway I said yes past tense I said that I was glad my friend Desi is coming back to work!  I miss her greatly.  She reminded me of the bumble bee tuna song!  I totally just downloaded it!  I went to Ruby Tuesdays tonight!  I am too full!  Shout out again to fat boy for waiting to eat all day!  I am the friggin bomb!  My cell phone now says What up fat boy?  when I turn it on!  How wonderful is that!  Fat people have more self esteem than Joan Rivers has face lifts.  She looks like she has 4 a day!  She looks like a pair of spandex booty shorts on a 1000lb gorilla!  Her shiznet is stretched!  But I still love you darling!  Hold up...stop...now wait a minute...I feel like dancing!  But anywho I have to go burn some cds.   Al v ter zane on the window pane!  Hello I'm not German!  Paul

      Hello.  So my dad tells me that there is this guy that is riding around D.C. shooting people with a deer rifle!  What is his damage?  Get on prozac mister or some drug that you could potentially overdose on.  Why are people so evil?  Get a grip on reality and kill yourself Mr. DeerRifleSharpShooterMan.  I don't mean to make fun of the situation but my lord people have gone insane.  I know that my journal is called insane and my stories are like out there but damn I don't go around hunting people.  Sometimes I wish the world would come to an end because of all the bad things tht happen to people.  I've accepted that I can't not have the world end when it happens.  I can't be like "Hey God could you please hold off for like 60 more years."  That is not gonna happen. When he is ready I've decided to be ready.  Get over yourself if you think you can change some like apocolypse.  It's like with Buffy the Vampire Slayer (which I love) she is able to stop the world from ending.  In this day and age who would want to do that.  Okay on the news all they are talking about is the tropical storm.  Eff that!  Talk about the man that is shooting I want to know that he is not around where I live.  That sounds really greedy but I want an update.  I need to know he is still around Montgomery County and that he is not near my mom's work.  I was supposed to do a speech today in law class....guess what?   It didn't happen.  The people in this class like totally went off on the issue of "Is Thermal Imaging a violation of our fourth amendment guaranty?"  I mean these people were like evil to the 100th cubed divided multiplied added subtracted square root of evilness.  I was so prepared to do my speech to!  I am bitter.  Bitter...bitter..bitter!  Have a cookie Paul is what I'm telling myself.  It will subside the bitterness with some sweetness.  Hey fat people are more rational relating to food.  It's comfort.  Like "comfortable."  Remember eatable well we now have comfortable...it combines comfort and table...it has to be good.  Can a fat boy get a little crack!  That's how they could cure obesity with crack.  Get all the overweight people of America hooked on crack and they will be thin in no time.  Then you go to rehab and bam you've had a hell of a time being high and now you are thin and can become fat again to go through the whole cycle again.  How nifty thrifty is that?  Probably not that good but it's a thought.  I am on a roll today.  The twilight phone has not come back to haunt me yet...I was ACD last night at work which doesn't require getting on the phones unless we are desperate.  I have to go to work to drop a cd to Susan.  I could collapse from exhaustion...I've had little sleep and no food today.  Shout out to fat boy...he hasn't eaten yet!  Let me tell you something I have to tell you about my English Professor and then I will stop writing.  This entry should be interesting and probably long because I am manic as Amanda has said.  So my professor is like the clone of Bill Saget or Ben Stein.  He is like obsessed with sex.  He loves literature that deals with sex.  Amanda and I have discovered that he is a pimp.  He wears like these shirts from the seventies with the collar open with the chest hair hanging out.  He doesn't wear underwear...Amanda and I noticed this.  I said do you see what I see and she said I was about to tell you.  Don't ask me how we noticed but we did.  He loves to bore us to death...picture the Ben Stein commerical "Do you have dry eyes?"  He talks just like that except when it comes to sex poetry or how he says "sexy poetry."  He has passion for sexy poems and the cuss words that are in there.  He needs to be evaluated by the FBI because I think he is an illegal clone.  He is like Species the movie trying to find an appropriate mate to have a species baby.  Amanda I think he has his eye on you!  Whatever he is weird and needs to be arrested by the fashion police.  You get a ticket Professor B!  Anyway I have to go listen to the news to like find out about what is going on that is usually the subject of the news but anyway I over analyze everything.  Goodbye!  I have to listen to Blanca Overfew...what kind of name is that!  Toodles to Poodles who eat Oodles of Noodles and draw Doodles (not intended to be preverted just supposed to be a sketch)!  You all have dirty minds.  Bye bye homefry!  Paul

      Hello again!  I am like really tired and about to pass out.  I need some speed or some form of jet fuel that is safe to take by a human.  Whatever.  Have you ever wondered why when someone yawns that if another person sees them yawn they have to yawn too?  What's up with that?  Maybe I should call Madame Cleo and she can tell me before I actually ask her.  But if she knows I thinking of calling her why doesn't she call me first?  Hello my phone number is listed!  Get off the crack Cleo I know you know that I know you know my phone number.  If you're psyhic prove it.  Call me now for you're free reading!  What the hell is she going to be reading Time magazine or People!  Maybe she should read the BBB handbook or the "Guide to being a psyhic with a really phony accent."  Anyway this is in no way shape or form intended to be mean.  It is just the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Later Alligator! Paul

      You better recognize!  What?  Hello everyone!  Just woke up from a wonderful nights sleep!  But the downfall is that I have to go to work!  Why...why me...why me?  It's totally not fair!  Can't I just find some rich sugar mama to like sweep me off my feet and give me everything that I have ever wanted.  She could be like 75 yrs. old it doesn't matter she would be gone in a few years.  I'd even take wire hanger woman.  As long as she promised not to beat me with them.  But she's long gone.  Anyway let me rephrase what I said last night we did not expect to look at naked people it just ended up that way.  Amanda and I get these weird ideas and they usually turn out for the worst.  Like when we said we were going to the race track to have one drink and got so drunk we couldn't remember getting home.  Hello!  Can you say hey you have a problem.  We don't drink that often but when we do lord help us!  I actually got Amanda to take a shot of wild turkey.  She said it wasn't that bad.  But hey after like four drinks who knows what's good or bad.  Tomorrow I have to give a speech in law class.  Amanda is supposed to sit in on the class.  I don't want to.  It seems like everytime someone gets up to give a speech that all the other people start yelling at the speech person!  I will tell them all to eff off if they don't like what I have to say!  Poof be gone evil law people classmates!  Niceness is a necessity that they lack.  I think most of the people were birthed in caves at least two look like they walked out of the movie "Clan of the Cave Bears"  Anywho gotta go get ready for work.  Later Masturcator!!

      I am really hungry and bored.  What a bad combo right?  Well Baby Girl is doing well.  She goes with me almost everywhere!  She went to the postoffice with me today.  She is such a nice little rat!  Anyway...so I've been thinking about the phrase "forgive and forget."  Okay so I'm crazy but that's okay!  If you can do that to someone else can you do that to yourself?  Interesting question..huh?  But whatever.  I went to WalMart last night to buy veggies for BG and I.  I got dip..she didn't!  I figure it would cause her to get upset on her stomach...however I may be wrong.  I got an 85 on my last test in English.  However, my quiz grades are really sucking!  I have not passed but like three of the eight quizzes!  Bad ProB!  He asks like these really weird questions that no one in their right mind would know unless they took a course on the story.  But whateverah!  I'm in a whateverah mood.  So here is today's adventure which I haven't had an adventure in a while.  So this girl brings in food and bedding for Baby G today.  Well she forgets to tell me "hey it's been in the garage for like four days."  Guess what I end up with in my cubicle?  You guessed it weevils!  These ugly little bugs that look like mini rhinos!  Well needless to say I had about 500 of them crawling around my cubbie!  They are all dead as far as I know because I had to play superhero Bug sprayer to the rescue man!  EWWWW!  I hate bugs!  But anyway, I'll talk to you all later!  Paul (I can't think of a rhyme today...my mind is rhymeless!)

      What up my people?  Guess what I have a new addition to my family.  My new pet rat Baby Girl or Baby G.  She is faboo!  She is white with gray and black on her body.  She is so adorable!  She was with me all night long at Texaco and then we went home and she played in her home while I got a bath.  She then proceeded to sleep on my shoulder for two hours.  Everyone except for Angel loves her.  She is a hoot.  She tried to play cops and robbers last night and tried to break out of her jail/home.  She was also playing trapeze artist swinging from the top of her cage.  She is named after Aaliyah's nickname Baby Girl!!  Well I will definitely be writing more about my adventures with Baby G.  She is going to get a batterized Barbie Car for Christmas so that she can pimp around the house.  Then when she is fully grown I am getting her a Barbie mansion.  I call her my little Thugtress...hence the name Baby G!  Talk to you all in a while crocodile!!!!!  Paul

      What up my people?  It's just me Paul writing for the first time in a couple of days.  So at work we had a Miss WV Pageant!  I was voted to be the raining queen and had to dress in drag!  It is not fun dressing as a woman.  Has anyone ever told you that!  It really sucks and your feet hurt really bad.  I was the bomb though mustache and all!  I was gorgeous.  I ever went to English dressed like that and my friend Amanda dressed as a hooker and the ol' Professor Buff told me that I was beautiful!  Imagine that!  He is a horny little professor.  I will never wear heels again because my feet are still hurting from two days ago.  I need to have Dr. Schol's come and visit my poor broke ass feet and repair them so I can walk halfway decent.  Work has been alright.  Service levels were really bad today but hell Desi and I have gotten them to a managable status!  Woohoo!  Go Desi and Paul!  Ms. Looney said that we rock...she is the bomb she has been up for like 17 hrs. or something doing physical inventory!  Ms. Pat just yelled at me and told me that she doesn't have time for my nonsense!  Whatever woman you do as I say!  Just kidding I'm your elder!  I won't work on your kitchen anymore woman!  Just kidding times two!  Well I've gotta go do some stuff later!  Bye bye home fry to the big Mickey D's in the sky!  Paul

      Good afternoon ladies and gentleman!  I've just awoken from a sort of wonderful nights sleep.  Remember how I said that I was going to play with Baby Girl well I did and she got loose again while I was doing a crossword puzzle.  That hoochie went underneath the door after moving a full size pillow.  I hear something in the wall that is in between my room and my parents wall closet.   Guess what? It was her.  She must have a thing for my parent's closet because she sure was groovin' in there like it was her own little discotech!  Rats on rollerskates with gold belly shirts on and those ugly white shorts!  Think back to the 70's!  And a blonde afro wig with hooker blue eyeshadow.  That's what Baby Girl should have been wearing at "Club Closet" last night.  Maybe I will make her an outfit.  She could play "PAUL'S FASHION EXTRAVAGANZA." It would be cool.  I could build her a run way to model all the latest coutour.  Designs by Paulblo Picasso.  Ha!  Moving on to more weird situations.  I had a dream about Wendy Burdette last night.  She was trying to get her job back at the Co. and she had to take all these test again and like go through massive interviews and they told her that they didn't need her because they already had Kake!  That's right they said "I'm sorry Mrs. Burdette but we will not need your services because we have hired Ms. Kake....K as in Kake!"  I was like oh no I didn't have a dream about Kake.  Between going OFF TRACK and KAKE I think we have hired a OFF TRACK KAKE MAKER who's obsessed with acting so smoked up it's not even funknee(*note:  there will now be words that have extra letters or letters that don't have the correct beginnings like k as in kake we not have funknee "Like Fun and Knee Ms. Franks:)  If you get this keep your m as in mouth closed!  I think it absolutely hilarious but I'm the one writing all this bullshit!  Ha..ha...ha..!  Now let me move onto more pressing news "FAKE HAIR", "HAIR WEAVES", "PHONY TAILS", "ANY OTHER HAIR THAT IS NOT YOUR OWN."  So I undertand if you can't achieve it weave it but damn!  Don't be puttin no hair color that obviously came off of a rainbow bright character.  Stick to natural tones.  Brown, black, blonde, red, auburn.  Not purple!  I know that I don't know the full spectrum that comes with fake hair but, you should still be able to see through the shit to see an ear or that there's still a face under the hair.  Lookin like an overgrown ferbie and shit!  I need to stop.  Because one day I too may need hair club for men....or weave club for white bald men.  I'm am so bad!  I watched part of To Wong Foo the other day!  Chi Chi Rodriguez inspires me!  I don't know why.  I think it's because John Lickcwozamo (I have no clue how to spell his damn last name but he was Taluse in Moulin Rouge) plays the part and he cracks me the phuck (yes ph like in fuck) up.  And Wesley Snipes is funny too!  "Go ahead Ms. Vita you speak honkey."  Ha...ha...ha!  It's so wonderful when people call white people honkeys!  I think it is fabulous!  At work we always are talkin to Constance like "it's because your black" and she is like "why's it always got to be black" and Angel is like "well why can't it be yellow" and I'm like "well why can't be be honkey?"  Please don't ask me where the hell those last couple of lines came from because I couldn't tell ya!  I have issues...no make that volumes of crazy thoughts!  But you all who read this know that...right?  Or am I the only one that realizes this reality of realness that is around me?  See there I go again with another weird thought?  Amanda are you sure we are at your house or is this a figment of your house?  Shout out to Amanda!  Well I have typed the shit out of myself today so I'm going to get going to wherever it is that I'm going to go because if I don't get going I'll never get going to go to the place that I'm going!  Try using a word like ten times in the same sentence it is fun!  So I'll write to you "TOMORROW...TOMORROW...I LOVE YA TOMORROW YOUR ONLY NINE HOURS AWAY."  Paul

      Secret Agent Message Relayer:  This mission if you choose to except it will be the greatest thing that you will ever accomplish...so do you take it? Me (a.k.a. Agent Longdongscholong):  Yes I know I can do it what is the mission?  SAMR: To save money!!  Me:  That is like death!  But I'm on the mission "dollar saver" impossible.  So I am on this mission to conserve money and try to conserve.  That sounds all responsible and stuff but I have like this big "WALMART SHOPPING EXTRAVAGANZA" virus that seems to haunt me almost every night.  I'm saving money this is the plan.  Gas money per week and $20 a week.  That's all I have to stretch the twenty for seven whole days!  Ugh...why can't higher education be free.  My mother has taken my debit card as per my request!  I feel like I've signed myself into a mental institution but the only difference is that it's the "Mental Institution for Paul needing to save his money and not be so frivoluous and buy every friggin thing that he wants and desires because he needs to have cash flow for a rainy day" type institution.  I think I can...I think I can! Woo Hoo!  So work has been pretty good except for my Sarah quitting.  I love her to death.  Constance and her are like my sisters that I've always wanted.  Between April, Constance and Sarah I have been able to extend my family to Mom, Dad, Me and three sisters!  Yep that's right you all I now have three sisters!  Angel C. is almost there but she is more like my princess that watches over me and makes sure that I'm taking care of myself type friend/mom!  It's well appreciated.  Baby G got an awesome cage for Christmas.  That is if you can consider being in a cage awesome.  But she now has an official "rat cage" with a purple igloo, purple wheel, purple bell thingy and her water bottle and food bowl.  She is wonderful!  She escaped the other night...but not really.  I forgot to put her back in her cage and fell asleep and she had 12 wonderful hours in the house.  She was found at the corner of my mom's dresser St. and inside the closet St.  She was swinging from the hangers in my mother's closet.  So I hope everyone had an excellent Christmas.  I worked but it was great.  I got to see my Desi and she had a surprise for me.  A big care bear!  Bedtime bear and I've been sleeping with him ever since.  He is a cuddle pillow.  I got a lot for Christmas $420, a new bed spread, sheets, pillowcases, curtains, shirts, movies, frames, egyptian box, tiger printed urn, bamboo candle, books, food, cologne, and a bonsai tree that lights up!  I made out great again this year.  I wish I could have visited the family though but the money was good at work and it will push me ahead of the game hopefully on my money mission.  I have to go OFF TRACK for a second and say POPCORN!  Susan you will know what I'm talking about and you too Tricia!  Ha..ha..ha!  I went with the parents tonight to see Gangs of New York and it was wonderful!  I loved the movie.  It was two hours and forty four minutes long.  I enjoyed spending time with my parents since we really don't get to do that that often.  We ate at Arby's and head to Walden books for me to get a calendar and mini oragami set and then to the movies.  I figure since I can't spend money oragami should keep me busy and re-painting my room!  It will be black, white, and turquoise.  I'm having my Aaliyah posters framed to go in the room.  I think it will look cool but who knows.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to Aaliyah and her family!  Hoping that each Day becomes a little better.  I know I know I get carried away but Aaliyah was a huge inspiration to me while she was here on Earth.  I only pray that I can be as talented as her!  Well I'm getting off here to go and like get a bath and watch a movie and play with Baby Girl for a while.  Until we meet again!  Smooches to some pretty pooches!  Paul

      Hello my little Christmas elves!  Hoping everyone was able to get what they wanted for Christmas and some more.  I made out pretty well this year.  I got perfume from Ms. Pat, a bonsai tree from Samantha, a baset from Tricia, 300 dollars, two shirts, movies, an alarm clock, bed spread, curtains, and pillow cases from my parents.  I'm redoing my room in Aaliyah.  It should be nifty!  Black, white and turquoise.  I am sooooooo tired.  I have to work today but the money is good so I'm not complaining.  It's snowing bundles outside.  Guess what I have a story that is quite funny and I think that you would enjoy.  So April is bringing me home last night on river road and we pass what looks like a dead dog.  Well she goes in reverse and we find that it's a baby deer.  So we leave and trudge on down the snow covered road.  Then we pass another animal dead and covered with snow.  You guessed it it was a deer again.  So I told April that we were in the frozen food isle.  Get it frozen food...deer meat!  Ha...aha!  So I am totally in love with Lilo and Stitch the Disney movie.  It is fabulous!  My love that one!  My favorite part is when Stitch claps and laughs when the one guy sets the stage on fire!  Darien, the little boy April takes care of on the weekends reinacts that scene everytime he sees it.  It is hilarious!  I don't have much to say today because it's Christmas and I'm tired and need to take a nap before going to work!  So I talk to you all later!  Bye bye....and MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!

      So this will probably be the longest journal entry ever because I have so much to catch up on.  So it is now like 11:02am and I have only had like 5 and 1/2 hrs. sleep but that's okay.  So turkey day went okay.  Well Christams is only like 11 days away and last night I was able to finish my Christmas shopping.  I was like screw it Paul get this shit done and over with and stop worrying over money because you know that you have the money to spend.  I have this problem where I am always worrying about money.  Can't explain it or understand it but I know that it's there.  Then I get over it somehow.  But at least my Christmas shopping is finito!  At least I hope so.  I think I may have to pick up a couple odds and ends but that's expected.  Anyway so I have this problem that I need to discuss before it eats my ear away.  That's right you've guessed it by Sally Wow!  I got my ear pierced.  Not only this time but three other times and guess what I just happen to be allergic to metals.  It doesn't matter what type of metal just any metal.  I bet you that my broke ass could wear platnium.  Yeah that's right broke ass boy sportin' a platnium chip! or the reverse side would be movin on up boy sportin' a tinfoil hoop in his ear!  Cha..please!  I wish my ear would get the fuck over it and except that damn metal.  "Hello look at this as an award. You are the winner except your fucking metal."  Ha..ha..ha that would be like the best handing over of the metal at the olympics speech!  "Listen here Canada, France, and America I have your metal and you better fucking take them don't even try to reject them."  How come I can wear jewerly but I can't actually wear jewerly?  Question time:  (Allahwischous Genie appears with the answer)  Well Paul the answer to your question is simple.  You just can't you asshole so stop trying to ruin your ear."  Me: Oh that is so wise of you ass master allahwischous Genie.  Moving on!  So I made these gingerbread people, and no Constance they aren't black or brown they are the newest fad gingerpaper.  I have Myrtle Garbagegab, Big Daddy Cane, and Margarita.  Margarita is a bow legged underage hooker pregnant with twins gingerbread person.  Big Daddy Cane is her pimp.  And Myrtle is Big Daddy's wife.  They are cute but I figured don't leave them exposed in the workspace Paul because someone might freak out and be like why did you create a image of me!  Oh no..how did my secret get out that all this time I pretended to be a call center rep but I am truly a underage hooker from Taiwan transporting twins into America!  Hello people it's the 2000's and they are just innocent gingerbread people dressing up for the holidays!  I think that I may have terrets of the brain...little spastic thoughts that just come and onto the screen.  Or maybe it's just me!  Now let's move on to my last days of college for this semester.  I have to say that I love you Professor Geffert because you are wonderful.  Now let's move on to Professor Buffathis, Buttathis, Buttfuckathis....whatever his fucked up name is!  He is such an asshole!  He gave me a 65 on my term paper!  Everyone who read it said that it was great and that they thought a B for sure!  Well guess what people you hit the wrong buzzer at the wrong time!  He said that I had very strong points but that he couldn't give me credit for them!  What...what...what!  Hello if they are there they need credit, money, foodstamps...something!  Then my final exam.  I think I did okay!  He changed the format of his test again...big no no!  He may have to be rounding grades this semester for the test again!  I tell ya these professors at Shepherd are like "You don't need to wake up and smell the coffee because we'd rather you sleep all day and not wake up to come to class." type professors.  They wear horrible clothes, hair pieces, jewerly, undergarments!  Ha..ha..ha.  I was only kidding about the jewerly.  Actually their undergarments are sexy!  That's what keeps Amanda and I going in Professor B's class...oops he doesn't wear any underwear!  Bulge the deck matey!  Gross...tuck your schlong back in place so that Amanda and I don't have to think about 50 year old penis wagging while you are lecturing!  Laura if you read this it was wagging in your face the first day of class since you sat in the from row!  You got all the action baby!  Wiggle Wiggle Jiggle Jiggle!  Well I have to keep the next part of my story on the DL yes the DL or LD which ever you prefer.  So Naszilla has decided to try to take over the world right?  Wrong Naszilla, Nostrildomis, Rosy Nosy just doesn't understand that it will not happen!  Don't come into Paul's world and try to man the ship because I'm the captain and what I say goes!  "Oh yes agree agree agree with me" shouts Naszilla.  "No I will not you are evil and will be punished" I reply  "Oh yeah take this." says Naszilla as it inhales through its nose and sucks me in through those ginormous passages until I faint from the shock of being stuck in a tunnel for days!  If you know what I'm talking about keep it to yourself!  You know that I'm right so let's stick together!  And now moving on to more pressing news: M or Kake!  This bitch did not go there!  K as in Kake.  Cake bitch cake!  What the fuck(in the words of Monique from Queens of comedy)! Maybe when I found that piece of hair by the time clock it was the link to her brain actually functioning.  Shit girl you betta get to the lost and found to get your cable connection back!  If you tell a customer yes I have that as K as in Kake...first of all the words changes pronunciation now it is Kah Key!  Not Cake!  Sometimes you feel like a nut sometimes you don't!  Well let me know M when you don't and I'll send you a present!  Lord help me for saying all this shit but damn sometimes it just needs to be recorded so when the human species is all gone and only animals or Tammy Faye Baker and Anna Nicole Smith are the only aliens left on the planet they too will be able to get a laugh from us!  Keep it on the screen now from screen to mouth to everyone else!  Remember this is here for my therapy and your entertainment!  I'm always watching!  Get the fuck out Paul you only got one real eyeball the other one is glass!  I think that I want to invent a glass eyeball that is remote controlled!  That would be off the chain, frame, lane!  Imagine if it got some weird surge of energy and started to go crazy!  Attack of the glass eyeball...when glass eyeballs attack....killer eyeballs from outerspace!  I am too much...really...all joking aside!  Not really but really anywho because I'm light headed and can't think of a damn thing!  Or maybe it's just that I'm tired and need to go back to bed.  I'm not sure!  But whatever!  So I think that I have just about wore myself out typing. Gotta go to the gingerbread person transporting in the cho!  Later home fried tater!  Paul

       If the Sandman offered counciling I would awake more   So this title is sorta on the borta of one of Katasha's little quotes...but I like it!  So I really was going to go to college today but I got sleeptracked and didn't.  If the Sandman offered counciling I would be awake more....really!  I'm not crazy I promise.  I had full intentions of getting my education on today and I did.  I have perfected today's lesson of:  HOW TO AVOID A BORING ASS DAY AT COLLEGE W/O EVEN OPENING YOUR EYES UNTIL 2PM!! (*Note:  The words are in all caps to emphaize(   If my butt were big would my lips ketchup?   This is definitely a Katasha quote/question!  So I've decided that people with big butts have the advantage of having junk o' trunk syndrome.  But they also have a full upper lip.  So if my butt were big would my lips ketchup?  I think that they would.  Then I would be dead sexy.  Angel, and Constance are always looking for my lip but it always seems to never be found.  I think it's just that my lip is smarter than them.  But sshh...don't say anything!  Just kidding you gals!  Actually I know that my upper lip is smarter than you gals!!  Just kidding...!!  Either Laura or Constance's butt has eaten my lip...(*Note:  My lips have not been near Constance's butt...LMAO) or Angel's head's gravatational pull has ripped what little bit I have into its black hole.  Who knows?  I wonder what someone would look like if they only had a bottom lip?  Duh...Me!!   Make up some more lyrics day   All you fatties pop your tummies like this Shake your flabby ass don't stop don't miss All you fatties pop your tummies like this Shake your flabby ass don't stop don't miss Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it now Eat it good, suck them bones just like you should Right now clean it good, suck them bones just like you should My back, I broke If I eat one more thing I'll have a stroke.  My neck, my back Eat me a Wendy's doublestack My neck, my toe Eat a ring ding or ho ho My neck, my ass I multiplying my mass My neck, my nose I'd even eat some panty hose.  First you gotta put you mouth up to it Don't stop just do it do it Then you roll your tongue from the back up to the front Then you eat it up til it's up and gone biggie Make sure you keep gaining pounds biggie All over your body and stuff Stretch marks so me so much love The best fat come from a bank The fat good fat is thick and long Slow eatin til the crack of dawn On the bed eat cookies and stuff Through the night gainin' so much tub Dead sleep when the sun come up!  So eat it now  Eat it good Eat the T-bone just like you should Right now eat it good Eat the person just like you should  My neck, my leg I need some food and a keg My neck, my ear Give me betsy or a deer  You might be thin, & look like trees But fuck that skinny get on your knees Fat girl here needs to eat Fat misses know what I mean At the Grub so fresh so clean Skinny hoes hatin guys watchin me So fat in the line so not lean With a turkey in my mouth so mean I gotta pick which biggie I need To take me to the sto' to get some feed Try me I'll make you see  You skinny bitches ain't got shit on me!  So eat it now  Eat it good Eat that turkey just like you should Right now eat it good Now eat this pussy just like YOU should!  My neck, my back Skinny boy likes to eat my fat My neck, yo' stack Once he's went fat he ain't comin' back!!  TADA!!  That took some hard work!!  Hope you all enjoy this...This goes out to my Tub o' rific ladies out there!!  Be a tubby boy makes me realize that tubby girls need lovin' too!  Bye...Paul

       My Neck...My back   Have you ever just woken up and were like..."oh my God my whole body is a under attack?"  Well I did this morning...I had this dream that I was in this Political class and that some heated debate came up and I wound up getting into a fight with the professor.  I kicked some ass but was worn out from the battle and came home and went to bed.  And guess what?  I must of been pulling some moves in sleep because I feel like Khia.  The only part of Khia I feel like is Neck and Back.  Because damn if I felt like the rest of her or the way she looked I'd have ended it all this morning.  I have some new song lyrics to my neck and my back that I would love to share with you today.   Make up some lyrics day   First I got to put my iron up to em' Don't stop just do em' do em' Then I press the steam  Titty stretch marks aren't the thing  Then I gotta suck it in til' I can fit into them baby Make sure I keep bustin' seams baby All over the place and stuff Cracked teeth nappy hair lookin so so rough Through the night makin so much love Man missin in my fat and stuff  So tuck it now Tuck it good Tuck my flab just like I should Right now tuck it good Tuck my flab just like I should  My neck...my back I can't see my coochie or my crack My neck...my back Can I get another Wendy's bigstack!  Tada!!  It's he lovely...isn't he wonderful!  Yes...I am I know it...Later people sittin on the steeple!  Paul

       Prozac Anyone?   Yeah that's right are you in need of prozac?  I am!  Actually I think that I'm in need of crack!  Dealing with life lately has been too much of a "Shopping Spree gone Bad."  You know one of those shopping extravaganza's you think is going to be wonderful because you have that 75% off coupon and you get to the register and the sales person is like:  "I'm sorry but that coupon is not valid with the items you have bought.  Please see the exclusions box at the bottom of the coupon."  Fuck the coupon...I'll pay regular price to have a regular day!  Ha...ha...ha!     If Santa were a women I'd get more presents   Yes...again that's right!  If Santa were a women I'd get more presents.  Actually I think that I'd be a millionaire.  I could be her sex kitten in exchange for winning lotto tickets.  Yes...I too have a naughty side.  Actually I have a lot of sides...most are comprised of fat but that's besides the point.  Picture it:  Mrs. Santa Claus: Oh yeah boy put a hurtin' on me! Me:  Yes Big Momma Thang!  Tap that ass! Mrs. Santa Claus:  Oh you so ba why boi!  You make me feel like slummin and cummin! Me:  Oh you naughty bitch you don't get a present this year!  Okay...so that was like way naughty!  But shit I've heard worse!  As they say in Abu Dabi....Kaqueramingo Saba go Saba go!

       Can you say....Belinda Carlisle was on crack in the 80's?   Well I can certainly say that she was.  Do you remember that song...Oh Heaven is a place on Earth?  Well I do and she was either high on crack or full of shit when she wrote it.  The lyrics should of went something like this:  Oh baby fuck the world Oh Hell is a place on Earth They say Hell and then stress comes first Oooo Belinda you made a fucked up verse!!  Why such the angry tone?  Hmmmmm....bigger hmmmmmmmmm to the tenth cubed degree.  I've decided that the "Weekend Bitch Fairy" came to visit me.  Yes not just one day but two days in a row.  Thank God I'm not a female who was on their rag because damn some bitches would have been blown the fuck up at work!!  If not myself first!!  Problem number one of 7,890!  Service levels were shit fried in more shit and topped with shit covered nuts!!  Shitty Shit Shittin Sundae!  Not bad enough!!  Desi calls out because she is sick!!  I'm alone...so very alone....not bad enough....she calls out the next day and then shit levels return and then a fight!!  I thought damn....Holyfield and Tyson are about to get the fuck ready to rumble.  I was about to call the Animal Control because they need some type of rabeas shot or something!  But I'm over it...except for some other petty shit that will be handled at a later date.  So now I have to tell you about the "Food Fairy."  She came to visit me last night at Denny's....yes and she made me dump marinara sauce on myself.  Fuck that veggie tale bitch!!  She is so lucky that I can't have her turned into a tossed salad.  I made a picture of her torturing me to send to my friend Gina in Germany!  I'd tear that stupid bitch up and have her lettuce wings with some ranch dressing...and the her carrott legs with some dressing and then her apple head would be fried in butter, and her orange body dumped in the trash!  Evil Hooker of Health!!  I think that someone at work has something against me!  I'm going to get to the bottom of it!!  Even if I have to sniff my way throught it!  But actually I like this person and I'm going to have a meeting with them Friday to discuss some things!!  Wish me luck!!  I might sufficate!   Attack of the killer flying white napkins Part I   Angel:  Can you give me a ride home Paul? Paul:  Sure get in the jeep....it's cold. Angel:  Oh it's okay why is your window fogging up? Paul:  I don't know let me turn on the defrost.... Angel:  AHHHHHHHHH!!!  What the fuck?  (Angel was attacked by flying napkins...they were all white...she felt threatened...she said I had to write about it!  It was fucking hilarious!!!  I wish you could have been there....but then again it probably wouldn't of happened if you were there.)  Angel don't worry us honkies are okay...now if it would have blown up in you face and been like one of those hats we said that it looked like then you would be sushi!!  But hey it was only a napkin!!  Ha...ha...LMAO!!!  (*Note:  Please be careful to bring in rodents or white napkins to Angel...she has a phobia for each of these...one a live animal....two a piece of dormant paper...go figure?)  Later masturbator!!!

       Make up a story day   So Mytle and I decide to go to the mini mart on the corner of 5th and 5th street to buy some supplies to make a time machine.  Yes a time machine.  We cracked the code to the universal time agency!  We can now shoot through time and space at the blink of an eye.  Guess what?  You have just been hit with make up a story day!!  Short but effective...right?  I am so ready for summer to come now.  It's way to cold out lately.  I think that if possible the "United Blanket Association" should invent a battery operated heating system that we can attach to our bodies.  Then we could all run down the streets with blankets and still be warm.  If cold could be displayed in measures of fat then I would be like covered in it!  Yes I'd be the State Puff Fat Fellow Man!  All that fat gone to waste.    This leads me to the new paragraph....the Fat Bank!  Angel and I have devised this plan to become vendors of fat products.  The only catch is that it's human fat!  We plan to move to Hollywood and start selling our fat for all those people that have to have implanted fat lips, hips, butt, cheeks, and any other body part they are lacking.  You see we have an ample supply of body mass so we figure we can share the wealth and make the wealth at the same time.  We will first have to start illegally and be like those "New York Sales People" that stand in Central Park selling under the cover of their jackets.  Then once we get capital we could totally blow up (no pun intended) and have a franchise of fat banks throughout the world.  Imagine no one would have to be bone thin...everyone could have curves. We would recruit people to donate fat.  They would become the "Fat Peoples Coalition For the Future Fatness of Frail Fellows."  Our motto is "Leading the World to Curves a Plenty."  Hey it could happen!!  Right?  Well later I'm headed to work to go bazerk!!  Chow to all of those that resemble a cow!!  Paul

       It's all about the 360!!   Yeah that's right...it used to all be about the benjamins but now it's al about the 360 baby!  Last night April and I took our jeeps 4 wheelin' in local parking lots.  The snow was just right for some 360's!  Actually a lot of them...like almost two hours worth.  Woohoo...circles hoe!  I thought though that people may get suspicious in the morning and this "Oh know the movie signs is coming true!" Snow circles it's a sign!!  Could you imagine the panic if some nut case actually thought that?    Nut Case:  Oh my!  There is like a huge outbreak of circle-i-tis!  What are we going to do? Me:  Get back in the jeeps and make squares and triangles!  Duh!!  See I always have the solution for stopping world panic...or maybe I just cause it?  I got in around 330am.  It's now 12:51pm and my head is hurting...don't know why!  I finally got an email back from Regina...my German mistress!  Actually she has been my friend for like 4 or 5 yrs.  She's in Germany in the Army.  You Go Gina!  I wish that she could come home soon so that April, her and I could get together for some of the famous "Wine Cooler Bottle Throwing at Signs" Contest.  So far Gina has been the only one to ever hit a sign with a bottle...and at that she through it over top of the car and hit the sign which was located diagonal from the passengers seat she was in.  That was one of the most funniest nights ever.  I remember being drunk with her and doing to this boat ramp.  Well you know the stupid me I go to the boat ramp and of course it's late out and the moon is out and I see a reflection and the water at the boat ramp which makes it look like it is a cliff for some reason.  And I'm all like "How do people get there boats off of this cliff?" and I'm also like "Regina stay away from the cliff...where's the boat ramp?"  After like 30mins I finally realize duh Paul you've been standing on the cliff/boat ramp the whole time but there is really no cliff.    Well I must say today since I forgot yesterday because I forgot it was January.  Happy Birthday To Aaliyah!  That's right she would have been 24 yrs. old!  What a shame.  But on a happier note her album and single Miss You are both #1 on the Billboard!  I knew that the album could do it!  Way to go Aaliyah fans for making her as strong a presence as ever!    Well I'm gonna go start gettin ready for work!  I have a lot of reorganizing to do today!  Kazoo my kizzer ko zinka de zey!

       Can you say..ZzZzZz?   Well I could if class would have been more interesting today.  I almost fell asleep. I could of swore that I took like 500 sleeping pills before my last class because damn Professor Millet you have that effect.  He should be the next Ben Stein or a spokesperson for Sominex.  I now think that I need a cup o' coffee like triple stength.  Sip...sip!!  I'm better!!  Well I'll write more later becaue I'm going out with Amanda and Raina for lunch.  Lunch....Frederick!! Ha!!  If school could be neater you wouldn't have to be a cheater!! Paul

       Can you say way expensive?   Well I can!  Yep...$192.50 for books today for class and only for three classes!!!!  Ugh what's with this pricing shit anyway?  Could I please have someone tell me because the last time I checked there was no shortage on paper making book prices go up.  I had breakfast with Constance and Sarah this morning.  I miss Sarah at work!  She makes me laugh so much and I love to hear her laugh.  I'm hoping that maybe she can come back one day even though I know she won't.  The only thing I'm not missing right now is the comments she left about me on her journal.  Maybe it's boredom or just a joke but I'm not sure.  The only thing I have to say is that I didn't appreciate the comments because I thought that all of us were cool.  But hey maybe I'm just reading too much into things.  Sarah I have much love for ya!  You know that.  When I write I don't always include everyone.  I've decided to keep our secret society off the screen because of what happened last time.  Don't think that I'm not your friend because you both know that I'm there for you whenever and wherever!  Much love for my sisters even though we don't get to spend much time together anymore.  And as for the note thing Sarah you were on que today because damn is my hand tired.  And not from masturbating...that was handled last night....just kidding...maybe...okay sort of....no for real!  I'm thinking about donating sperm just to pay for college and tuition.  Hey Sarah and Constance you know what?  If you want you can like sell your eggs and up to 1000 dollars each. Quick money and hey it could be fun.  But men only get like 200 dollars for there jism!  Isn't that shitty...sticky!! Ha...haa....haaa!!  Shout out to Laura "Aka Figure to kill" Hairball!!  Saw her today at college.  Damn Laura as I see you more often at school you seem to be lookin' better.  Back that ass up girl!! Just joking...but not really!!  Ass is killer!!! and not a bad package to go along with it!  Well gotta go....heading to the Burg...may stop and see Sarah after I have dinner with Kylene tonight!!  Toodles to oodles and noodles cuz it Ruby's Tuesdays tonight baby!!!!  Paul

       Can You Say Damn?   So today is the beginning of the rest of your life....at least tomorrow is the beginning of my hectic life.  That's right college is back in session.  Damn...damn...double damn.  What the h e double curvy noodles.  Ah!  I don't wanna mommy can't you just hit the lottery and like let me mooch off of you for the rest of my life.  Please?  I need school supplies...I don't think they are considered college supplies.  If they were there would probably be a sign that said school supply section and college supply section.  And of course the college supply section would be way overpriced just like the books!  I think there should be a freeze on book prices to zero dollars.  Yep that's right zero dollars!  That way I could buy a new outfit or two for college.  I could be fly and in style instead of  smart and homely lookin!  But hopefully everything will be okay!  Wish me luck or you will suck!

       Can You Say Fuck?   Well I can.  That was the word for work today...that is anytime the phone rang.  Yeah, what the fuck do you want?  Oh to cause me to have a nervous break down.  Thanks and have a fucking wonderful evening.  Would you like some fuck flakes to go with your milk?  So Phillips lines decided to be mentally retarded today and try to fuck with me and Desi all night.  And their up and their down and their up and their down.  I felt like I was on a boat headed for the tropical storm "Sea sick up and down teeter totter."  I thought I was going to go crazy(well crazier).  But by the end of the night Amy O. was like let it ride....ha!    So Desi, April and I went to the hot spot and played some cards.  It was fun and yes...yes...yes I won!  Go Bomb Phase ten player boy!  You are the shit in a bizcuit!  Ha...ha..ha!  Don't hate...congratulate!  Anywho!  I had a really good time tonight just the three of us chillin'!  I would love to do it every Saturday but college is starting on Monday!  Duh...dun...dun!  So you're probably thinking is this a Noxema commerical or what!  Clueless!  Remember?  Well I do!    Everyone tells me that I need to organize my thoughts a little better instead of blabbering like the idiot I'll never be so I'm in paragraph mode.

      So so so so so....I'm bored and ready to collapse from exhaustion...and I've had 12 hours of sleep and am listening to bomb ass music....what the fuck Paul wake Up?  Haaaaaaaaaaaa!  I really need a vacation...you know? But not just the average vacation....I want a special one...here is the idea.  So I decide to go back to Hawaii and I am like damn I wish I were thin so when I get off the plane people are drooling over my firm ass and tight body and out of nowhere Plastic Surgeon Genie pops out of nowhere and is standing on the plane with his full team to take on the fat that has mysteriously appeared on my body.  Hell I don't know where it came from.  So there I am and I have this really easy surgery on the plane to Hawaii and bam bam with a can of spam...I'm model material.  So I get off the plane and everyone stops turns and collapses from my good looks!  And I am like I know I would do the same because now I am thin and I can act that way.  So I get to the hotel which is wonderful and everything is like perfect because I'm thin.  Yes being thin is the key to perfection.  And there I am on Hawaii with no one with me and I'm like shit I look good and I know this but I need to have some friends transported over to visit.  And just then Travel Agent Genie pops up and he's like "Oh my god you look so good have you been to see Plastic Surgeon Genie?" I'm like no I did this on my own and I tell him to give me some of my friends and he does.  Over pops Desi, April, Amanda, and Angel( to add some spice to the group).  So I'm like I wish there was a club we could go to that like was totally all about pleasing us and out of nowhere Agenda Planning Genie pops up and like says "Okay I have you scheduled for dinner at the most exclusive of exclusive restaurants and then there will be a limo ride to "The All About Pleasing Paul Club"  I'm like no way and the genie is like way and then he's like you look bomb how did you do it and I'm like ALL BY MYSELF and he is like no way and I'm like way!  So we are all at the club chillin and I'm like I wish we had free drinks because I am really tired from dancing and need some refreshments and you guessed it Bomb Bartender Genie pops up and is like "here are the most fantastic drinks of ever and may I tell you Paul you look really good how did you do it?"  And I'm like it was hard but I did it by myself!!  And then we leave the club go back to the hotel and get some sleep.  So then I'm like I wish I had to stop wishin for all this shit to happen and then Perfect Vacation Genie pops up and is like "Okay so you are going to have the perfect rest of your time here in Hawaii vacation and you look really good how did you do it?"  And I'm like duh I did it all by myself.  So the last genie distapears and Desi, Angel, April, Amanda and I spend the rest of the time on the beach and just chillin shoppin and clubbin!!  That would be the bomb vacation!  Ha...ha...And he's off.....................................................................................................his rocker!!!  Paul

      This is an apology to my TD sisters:  So I know I am the big mouth.  That's the obvious...right?  I hope you know that I did not mean to let the Secret Society TD Club information slip out.  I wasn't thinking.  Yeah that's right I wasn't thinking and didn't catch on to what was being said.  The most I can say is that I'm sorry and that I really didn't mean to go that far.  You know that I consider you my sisters and I care for you both as if you were blood.  The most I can do is say that I am sorry and hope that you will accept my apology.  I don't know I'm really upset right now so I'm like not making much sense trying to type any farther.  I hate to have people mad or angry at me and it effects me where I can't get my words together.  I'm at a loss for words because I can't think of another way to say what I want to say to you both.  Imagine that Paul with nothing to say.  I think that needs to happen more often than not.  I've disappointed you both two times now because of my mouth and understand if you are upset but I'm hoping that all can be forgiven.  My big brother duties are slacking aren't they....yep they sure are!  I'm the dick...the one with the overflowing mouth of information...I take full credit for it.  Well I really can't think of anything else to say except for I apologize and wish that I could take it back.  (To all the other readers don't read into any of this because you have no idea what I'm talking about...I just ran my mouth the wrong way tonight)  Love you both :()

      So hello my people!  I am like really tired because I've had like no sleep...but that's not my fault?  No for real it's not!  I couldn't fall asleep last night for the hell of me and then I decide to watch Lost Souls and had some really fucked up dreams.  Especially about Desi.  I tell you about one of them.  So Desi and I have a child together.  I have no clue why I dreamed this.  But we are like happily married and have a daughter.  We live in like CT or VT.  I don't know why but one day I wake up and I can't see Desi's face or my child's face.  They are not indentifiable.  I remember getting out of bed and telling Desi I would be back in a couple minutes I was going to check on our baby girl and I find this doll that is missing it's eyes.  On its forehead there is this  weird symbol and it's mouth is closed.  I go back to Desi tell her everything is okay and beside me is the doll but this time it's mouth is open like it is screaming.  Weird Huh?  I mean not being married to Desi with a child but the doll part and you know what the really weird thing is I never saw our daughter....I was in the room but she was not there...!  Weird Like the twilight phone has like directed itself into my brain or something.  I don't know tell me what you think I'm on alien right now so I've gotta go!  Later nightmare on Helm st.

So last night was wonderful.  I got pretty drunk as you can tell by the last entry.  But I sobered up around 1am or so.  I had lost o' funs!  Ha..ha..ha..!  But anyway I don't have much to talk about today plus I'm trying to type to Joyce (Crackwhore Mama) Wiltedflower!  She is the one who passed out at her own party!  Her bad.  Later people/bitches!

       Bastard   So you all know about the alien that a lot of us have a work.  So I come home and Aaliyah's boyfriend is all chatty and wants to talk over the phone.  Incase you don't know...Aaliyah is my alien.  So I'm like shit how can I make this happen.  Boyfriend's name is #1 Stunna.  So I recruit my friend April to talk to him.  We meet after I get off work later that night and she calls.  He is all like let me call you back when I get a shower and April was like no I'll call you back.  So she did and I'm guessing it was either his girlfriend or mother that was answering the phone the first time because each time after that we got hung up on.  He is supposedly 18 or 19...but he is a pussy.  So if anyone wants to call him I have the number and he lives in Ft. Lauderdale Florida.  Here is his number...please feel free to call and harass him for being so rude to April...954-964-9798.  But don't mention who you are just torture him.  But it was absolutely hilarious because he broke up with Aaliyah today.  Bastard...who does he think he is...anyway I've got the digits and I'm sharing.  Ha...ha...ha....April and I got broken up with by an alien and he was to pussy to talk to her.  The only bad thing is is that Aaliyah Alien dated him for 30 days...that is pretty long.  You know.  But April, Aaliyah and I will move on to bigger and better "dick" as April said.  She can have the dick I just want the fun of being so sneaky.  Anyway...not going into work today.  The backage is out so I'm not even trying.  Goin to the doctor's tomorrow...yippy ky aye!!  Later...from the broken hearts of April, Aaliyah, and Paul....#1 Stunna is missin' out on it all.

       Better off being alone   So I finally decide that I need to open my heart to people more and let them a little closer.  Well that was my 450th mistake of the decade.  So why is it that when I decide to try to become a more open person that the door gets closed right in my face.  I've decided that I am better off being alone.  I mean I'll have my family, April and Amanda but as for that I'm going to have to distance myself from a lot of other people.  Constance, Angel, and Sarah please don't take this the wrong way...you three are still my homegirls for life.  But I've decided that my heart is going to remain permanently closed...vacant..dormant.  I've had it with being Mr. Nice all the time without even asking for anything in return.  What I do get in return is attitude, snide remarks, and sometimes even extremely hurtful things said to me.  Sometimes I wish that I didn't exist because I'm the person that will always be on the outside looking in.  When I finally start to share myself with people it's like I'm judged, call a freak, or even worse.  I have many layers to my personality that I would love to share with people but I've come to the conclusion that these layers will stay permanently bond for only me to know and understand.  Have you ever wished that for one day people could experience what it is like to be you?  Well I have...actually I've wished that I could be someone totally different on a regular basis.  I'd love to escape from my own reality into some better reality where I'm actually accepted and not seen as a nuisance.  My heart is so full of pain that I feel it will give out on me sooner than anyone expects.  It sometimes eats me alive to think of certain things that have happened to me and still continue to happen.  I'd love to have a family one day and you know it may happen but I'll still think I would be better off alone.  Alone is a place where I find comfort and stability.  It's where I learn the most about myself and about who I truly am.  I'm not the person that people see me for because everyday I wear a masque that hides the true me and that's how it will always be.  I've always hid behind masques like I'm on an extended trip to a Masquerade Ball.  I'm not only 3 dimensional emotionally but probably 100th dimensional.  Being silly is my way of dealing with everyday life.  Again I do believe that God has blessed me with the talent to make people smile...even if it is only for a second but I wish that I got something that I enjoyed in return at least once.  Granted that I do have a lot to be thankful for in most part to my family...especially my mother and father but the only thing that I truly want above all things is peace.  Peace with myself to accept that I will be the person who grows old and dies alone.  But I've come to realize that alone is a comfort that not many people have been able to master.  Love Paul

       Back to the drawing board   So yeah my back is off the hook right now.  I'd give anything to live a normal day again where my back wasn't an issue.  Not being able to sleep is really starting to piss me off.  I know a lot of you are probably tired of hearing me talk about my back problems so I've resorted to writing about it.  It's not fun...not at all.  I wish I could just have a healthy body so that I could enjoy the things that most people my age do.  For instance, going on road trips, rollercoasters, and the simplest of things sitting and walking.  I'm trying to just deal with it and hope that God helps me through this again but it is getting harder day by day to cope with the fact that I'll never be able to 100% fully recover.  I'd love to be able to go on hikes and little excursions with April and my other friends but it always seems like I'm held back because of my back.  I've lost all reflexes in my right leg and now it's working on my left leg.  I'm hope that I won't wind up in a wheelchair because if I keep losing muscle mass that's what will happen.  I hate having to be stuck on pain medication just to function because I feel like I'm in outer space half the time.  I've dealt with so much bullshit so far in my life and I was hoping that surgery last summer would end body troubles at least until I got older but, you know things just don't seem to work that way.  I don't know if this is like my big test and God is trying to see how strong of a person I am or if it's a punishment for something I've done but I just wish that it would stop.  Plus this puts a lot of pressure on my parents because they are constantly worried about me and what's going through my head.  Yes I have in the past thought about suicide because I had gotten to the point where waking up each day was just too painful but I've realized that I can pull through this.  I have a great support team between April and Amanda and other friends.  Just the daily are you feeling better makes me feel better because I know that my friends actually care and I wouldn't want to go and mess things up and never be able to see my friends again.  I also would never consider going through with suicide because I'd miss out on my future as well as my family.  So this paragraph is basically a little recap of my frustrations but also to thank my friends and family for being so supportive even though my back issue probably annoys the hell out of them.  But thanks for at least caring!!  It is truly appreciated.   When Aliens Attack   So Tricia got me, Susan and Samantha hooked on www.alienaa.com .  It is where you take care of this alien and battle other aliens.  At first it was really cool but I've decided that I'm giving up my alien whose name is Aaliyah.  I gave Sam and Susan all my funds and herbs.  I hope that they enjoy them.  But I'm afraid that Aaliyah Alien is going to become that new series "When Aliens Attack" because she is now abandoned and will only be used to collect herbs for Sam and Susan.  Work it!  Work until your dollar bill eyes fall off evil alien troll whore!  Ha...ah...ha!!  Anyway I send a special dedication out to Aaliyah Alien...you were a great companion for the like 6 months I played the game!!   Crack Kills   Yes we all know this but Amanda and I were watching the weather channel yesterday and this stupid ad pops up in the corner of the screen and it's an advertisement for Zim's Crack Creme.  What the fuck?  Amanda went to the website and it's for like over dry hands and such.  It can be used anywhere.  Who in the hell would want to carry around a tube that says crack creme?  Hello that just sounds nasty.  Like some mad scientist formulated butt in a tube.  Ewww!  Picture it:  Betty Spaghetti:  Oh my look at my dry and weathered face...what am I to do? Zim-a-zam:  [Pops in from no where] I have the answer and it's in this little tube that costs $7.60.  Here try it. Betty Spaghetti:  Oh my this creme works wonderful.  What is it called? Zim-a-zam:  It's crack creme.  Now not only do you have smooth skin but you also have our signature tan.   Betty Spaghetti:  A new tan...what the hell? Zim-a-zam:  Yes crack creme.  You now are a shithead!  Enjoy and don't forget once you use crack you never go back.  Get it...shithead...crack creme?  It also sounds like so butt lube for anal sex too but hey the website said you can use it anywhere so who's to say it won't become the next big anal ease of the 21st century?  Well I've gotta go get ready for work.  I think I'm staying the night in the hotel but I'm not sure yet.  With 18 more inches of snow supposedly coming it may be for the best.   Closing statement   Everyone have a great weekend in the snow and don't forget to try Zim's Crack Creme you can find it at you local Cow Manure Depot.  Later my peoples sitting on steeples that drive jeeples!  Love ya all for sucky belated Valentine's Day!

       Fashion...turn to the left...Fashion...now turn to the right   So I am totally obsessed with the Barbie Fashion plate thing that April bought.  I'm going to get one tonight.  I am officially the fashion coordinator for Barbie now.  Isn't that great?  I thought so.  I am so tired and do not feel like going to work but hell...I'll design me some clothes!  Fashion...turn to the left!  Ha...ah..ha do you remember that song from Clueless?  I do.  I need so much to go back to bed but I'll make it today!    I wish I had a service plan set up with the Sandman.  Cha-ching!!  Deposit two dollars for a peaceful nights sleep!  The Sandman would be really rich if he charged for his services.  I think it would be cool if he offered the "look like you are awake" plan.  Picture it...your at you station and your eyes are open and you can fully function but you are really asleep!  How cool would that be?  I think it would be the coolest of ever.   Hope you are feeling better   So my lil' sister is feeling under the weather.  I would love to know what is wrong with you babe...call me anytime if you need anything.  I hope that you feel better Constance.  I've missed you the past couple of days and have thought of you several times!  See I actually missed you!!  Love Ya C!   Phase 10   I'm such the bomb ass player of the phase 10 clan!  I love it.  On Tuesday I played cards at Denny's with April, John, Tom, Samantha and myself.  And guess what?  You guessed it...I won!  I'm the big ol' fat winner!  Score one for Paul!  I love that game.  Thanks be to God for Paul introducing me to that game!  In case you don't know who Paul is he is the Texaco guy that April and I go often to see!  He is so fucking hilarious!  Especially when it ices on the ground and he becomes the Olympic Ice Skater Girl!  Ha...ha!!  Paul is like in his 30's and his boyfriends name is Tom!  Both of them are absolutely fabulous!  They crack me the fuck up!  Paul's favorite saying is "You Mary Jane Rotten Crotch" and "Jimmy Crocket in my pocket."  I think they are faboo!  Well I've gotta go!  Off to planet AB&C to have a lovely warm heartfelt Hallmark moment of a night!  Chow to the cow that smells foul at Golden Corral!  Paul

       Lifestyles of the broke and not so famous   That's just about what my bank account is reflecting right now.  Ugh why can't I have lots of monies to spend.  Especially today.  I went to the movies with Amanda and we had a wonderful time.  Guess what we saw?  Darkness Falls...it was really creepy and all I have to say is thank God all of my teeth have fallen out.  Crazy!  So before that we went to Best Buy where I purchased two dvd's Sweet Home Alabama and The Big Hit.  I put it on my charge card that my parents have but guess what?  I still have the number...sneaky!  Then after the movie we went to Bonton and Amanda got a half carat thumb ring...it is really cool looking.  So I almost charged a half carat diamond ring for 600.00 it was half price but I didn't.  I got a new watch though.  It's made by Fossil and the face changes from black to red.  I love it.  Amanda and I also made stickers where we are giving the finger of course and one where she is showing her boobs....but she still has her bra on.  It was funny!  We did this in the movie theatre.  Today was a good day.  And last night was WONDERFUL.   My lucky night at Texaco   So I went to Texaco after playing Phase 10 at Denny's with Tom, April, John, Samantha and myself.  I stopped to get a soda and some chips and I was like give me five scratch offs.  I spent 5 dollars and won 29.  Then I put back in 9 and won 20 more.  I was on a roll.  Altogether I won like 35 dollars off of 5 dollars. I had this dream a couple of nights ago that I will win 1800 dollars off the scratch offs but hell 35 is better than nothing while living the "Lifestyles of the broke and not so famous."     Picture it:   Instead of Robin Leach being the host of the show it would have to be some trailer trash queen like Roseanne Barr!  Woohoo!  That is one crrrraaazzzy fat motherfucker!  And did I mention she is the trailer trash queen.  April I know as much as you consider yourself this title when we are together you have been dethroned.  You don't live in a trailer honey you live in a house!  A nice house at that!  So the show would be like totally whoa!  Like this:  Roseanne:  So Paul tell us about your fucking broke down palace bank account? Me:  Ugh...it's broke! Roseanne:  No shit fuck face!  You bastard!  Clit!  Dong without the schlong! (*Note:  I think she may have terrets)  What a wonderful family show that would be!!  Anyway I'm off to Wally World to look at paint for my room!  Talk to you soon watching out for my white ass full moon it'll be exposed by noon....but I refuse to show my coon!  Ha...ah...ha LMAO!!  Paul

       Size Matters   So on Thursday I went to the Caps v. Penns game with Desi, Rita, Jason(egghead), Kristen, Denise, Dave, Harry, Crystal, and Susie...there was ten of us all together.  I want to write about this so I remember because I had fun.  So anyway...we are on our way to Shady Grove...crusin along at a cool 85 mph.  Kristen and I are managing to speed past each other a couple of times on the way there.  So we make it there 45mins late and we are on the Metro!!  Woohoo!!  We get on a car by ourselves and Crystal wants to take a picture...cool idea...right?  Yeah it was until this guy like jumps out and is all like "I'll take the picture for you..."  Where the fuck did you come from?  He was there all along.  Any way...so we get to the game and go to our seats after riding what seemed to be the "escalator expedition."  Four flights of escalators!  So the end of the first thingy ends and I'm like I I have to take a piss.  Well Kristen and I go to the bathrooms...her's is right outside the door.  I'm like "DAMN IT" why does mine have to be on the other side of arena.  So I walk like 50 arena blocks to the men's bathroom...wait 20 mins in line and then I get to my urinal and guess what...there is this big ass sign for Harley Davidson stating..." Size Matters ."  So not only do I have to wallk for two hours, wait for two hours, but I also have to have a sign judge the size of my dick.  And to make matters worse after I'm feeling undershafted!  No pun intended...actually yes there was I made this word up!  I go back out to get a beer and a pizza and diagonally from the women's bathroom is the men's bathroom like 10 paces away from the section door!  What the FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Agh!  But it was all well worth it because if 8 inches isn't enough then the women is wore!  Ha...ha...ah...ha!     I'm so wonderful I should be bread   I like that title here's the poem:  I'm so wonderful I should be bread, So much wonderfullness in my head.  I'm so wonderful I should be famed, Eight is the number don't be ashamed.  I'm so wonderful I should be rich, Find me some sugar momma bitch.  I'm so wonderful I should be sexed, But that life seems seriously hexed.  I'm so wonderful I should be thin, Goodbye to my double chin.  I'm so wonderful I should be here, Fat, broke and full o' cheer.  I'm so wonderful I should have a gal, My eye is set on someone who's a pal.  I'm so wonderful I should hope for the best, Holding this one will be a test.  I'm so wonderful Mrs. Looney tells me so, And that is really nice to know.  I'm so wonderful and love all my friends, Hope they feel the same to the very ends.  I'm so wonderful I know better than to be this vain, So I'll put and end to this like a rock through a window pane.  That is wonderfully wonderous wonderful wonderfullier wonderously wonderfatty patty to the squirrel in the caddy!  Anyway...gotta go dye my hair...It's way to gray for a person that is only 22!  I'm starting to look like Pa Kettle!  Good bye...good luck...get high..get fucked....!  Paul

       These Boots are made for walkin'   And that's about all I can do.  Man!  Ugh!  I want to go dancing so badly.  But my boots are from the Dr. Schol's department...that's right I'm on the dancing sideline.  My back will not let it be permitted to shake my groove thang.  I am officially a wallflower.  How much does that suck?  Well let me tell you...it sucks worse than a high class hooker sucking chrome off of her vibrator!  Ha...ha!  But whatevah!  I'll get my dance on after back surgery again...this summer.  I also need a butt implant.  You know I can shake my flatjacks...but I'd like to have something to back up!  My next surgery will be for the fun of me...but implants!!   Spring is here...at least I think   It is so wonderful outside.  I wish that I could be on some extended vaykay!  Has the official Spring date on the calendar been met yet?  Someone please let me know when Spring is official!!  Later my peeps who drive jeeps!!

       Boogadee...boogadee...bee!   Isn't that like the cutest little thing for a child to say.  April's cousin Kimmy has a little boy named Jason.  He is a little munchkin the size of my pinky and this is his new favorite phrase to yell.  He is such a little ball of joy.  He runs around and puts his arms to the side of himself and just screams out "boogadee...boogadee...bee!!"  I think it's funny.   Darien Cordelle Prince   Oh my!  is all I can say about this little tyke.  He is such a bad ass.  He is the baby that April and her family watch on the weekends.  They have watched him since he was 6 months old.  He is a trip.  I think he is going to grow up to be a spy or a comedian.  Today he played in the mud puddles up at April's house.  It was hilarious.  Vic, April's father, kept telling him to stay out of the mud...and what do I do...I tell him to jump up and down in the mud to scare the fish (pretend).  And what do you think he did?  That's right he jumped and jumped until he became mud covered.  He is adorable.  He is African American and White.  He has brownish blonde curly hair...big ol' green and blue eyes and a mouth that any sailors mom would be proud of.  Here is a story about him before I go for the "land of a thousand pillows."  Paul:  What a stupid ass! (talking about someone on television) Darien:  Aww...Paul said a bad word April. Paul:  What did I say that was so bad? Darien:  I can't say it.  But you said "ass." (with a little grin and a wink of the eyes) Paul and April:  What other bad words aren't you supposed to say? Darien:  Well I'm not supposed to say them.  I can't tell you them.  But they are ass, shit, bullshit, jackass, fucker, booby-sucker!  April, Paul made me say bad words! Paul:  Tattle tale!  And April asked you the same question so how am I to blame for you saying them? Darien:  Because I said so...stupid ass!  Yes, that's how the story goes.  It was so freakin' funny!    In the words of Darien....later booby-sucker!!

       I'm tired of being tired   Ugh...it's one of those days.  Actually nights.  I'm at home writing in my journal after putting in a shitty six hours at work.  I was okay productive wise.  Whatever.  I'm tired and need sleep but I'm going up April's after I get off of here to bake stuff.  I'm just tired of being tired.   Desi   I apologize for being the pain in your ass that I seemed to be over the weekend.  Whoever told you that I was mad at you...I was just blowing off steam on my journal.  You know I enjoy working with you girl we are the "TEAM!"  Much love to you Desi just ignore me anymore...stress is taking over my life and it's getting harder to deal with each day!  I'll talk to you this weekend.   Constance   I'm hoping that you are doing okay.  I never got a response back from you.  Maybe you haven't gotten the celly back yet I don't know.  I just wanted to let you know that you are in my thoughts and that I hope that everything is okay in the Burg with you.  Tell Sarah I says "ello."  Love Ya Tinkers!!   Doin the Butt   For the first time in like a year I have actually been able to do the butt!!  Not some sexual position just the dance.  Yes the doctor's now have me on major pain killers so my hips can actually move without looking all gereatric and shit!  I have no clue how to spell ger-e-at-trick!  But you get the drift.  I think my next big move now that I'm "Heavily Medicated For Your Safety" is to try belly dancing since April bought that cool little mini belly dancing kit.  I could be a professional considering my belly is the size of the Big Apple!!  Male Belly Dancers  Later tater!!  Paul

       Who gets the last word   Okay guys.  Thank god the battle of the century is finally over.  Here are the last words:  No one write anything about it anymore.  It's over.  Finito.  I know that I really don't have a right to say anything since it was partially my fault but I'm just glad that it is over and that I have what I have from it.  I have April still as a friend.  And I have Constance and Sarah still as friends.   I just want to know that no one is going to write anything else about anyone else involved .  We have all decided that it's over......and I just want to say that I hope these are the last words about it and that we can all move on from here wether it be the four of us or 3 and 2.  (Don't get confused 3=Me, Sarah, Constance or 2=April and Paul).  So to my little sisters:  like I said I'm glad that everything worked out between us.  To Ace:  Last night at the overlook was hilarious....pickle and buns!

       Honestly   Ugh...another day another dollar.  But you know what I'm tired of someone saying I'm pissing them off.  Fuck it...like I haven't been pissed off before and not said anything.  But this is the second time that this person has told me this.  If you have such a problem with me then you don't need me on your shift.  However, you contradict yourself when you say that you want me on the shift.  Make up your damn mind.  Maybe, it's just one of those irritable days...who knows?  Or maybe it's just me reading too much into it.   Tricia   Again my prayers and thoughts are with you.  I'm hoping that you are doing okay.  Again you know how to contact me if you need anything.  Hopefully each day is getting better.  Love ya girl!!   Yada...yada...yada   So here is a funny story that may or may not make you laugh:  My cousin's baby was at my grandmother's house the other day and here is a conversation that he had with her at the kitchen counter...he is three.  Peewee Al:  Granny I have something to tell you. Granny:  What is that Peewee? Peewee Al:  Well I've thought about it and I think that I need to find you a boyfriend.  Poppop and you are just not compatible.  So I'm looking for you a new boyfriend...okay? Granny:  Well isn't that sweet but I don't think that I need a boyfriend.  I'm mean what would we do with Poppop...he would be all alone? Peewee Al:  Well I will find him a girlfriend since he doesn't know how to take care of hisself.  So now I have to find you a boyfriend and him a girlfriend.  What luck?  OMG I cannot believe this came out of a three year olds mouth.  I think it is hilarious and I hope you find it the same.  Later

       Just Me   I'm tired...exhausted.  I just want peace.  Sometimes I feel like the only peace I'll find is when I die.  I don't know just how much more my heart can take.  I am a stone wall whose barriers are slowly starting to breakdown.  There breaking down so fast that I don't think I'll make it to see 23.  I'm depressed..confused...I'm slowly dying inside.  All I want to do today is cry.  Cry because that's all I have left to do.  It seems like in my life when things are going for the better there is always some obstacle that arises.  Why does it always have to come so soon when things seem to be in order.  I've cried over the whole Constance and Sarah and April issue.  I feel like it's my fault...like I should have never introduced them then everything would be okay.  I feel like I create all the drama that comes in my life and I also feel like that is all my life will ever be.  One big let down.  All I can say to Constance and Sarah is that I'm sorry for excluding you in my life.  I've been dealing with demons that I sure will overtake me.  But no one needs to know what they are.  I'm a mess....a total mess.  Today is the first day in a long time that I've thought life just isn't worth it.  Today is the first time in two years I've wanted to end it.  No this isn't a cry for help it's just another part of me that most people never get to see.  The depressed side.  Although it is there everyday I keep it bottled up inside because it's something that I have to deal with and no amount of love or any amount of pills will ever take it away.  I will always have a wall when it comes to showing my emotions...it's just something that has always been here with me.  I'll die with a broken heart because I'm not willing nor will I ever be ready to let people inside.  Sometimes I think that I'm truly crazy and that I avoid reality.  I'm tired of being happy all the time because happiness isn't coming from a happy place.  Life is just a mess.  It would be better off ended.  I wish that I could take some pills or something to make me feel better today but I have a feeling that no matter what I were to take that it wouldn't help.  It would probably spiral me even deeper into myself.  And that is not a good thing.  The deeper I go the more I seem to find out that I worry about.  I am absolutely losing it.  I just want to go away.  If Dr. Kavorkian were here today I'd probably take him up on his offer.  But I'd have to decide that I am that brave.  To take your own life is the bravest thing someone can do.  At least in my book.  But aside from that I'd never do it because deep down even through all this bullshit I'm still thankful to be alive.

       Save the Drama   You know the past couple of days I have truly come to think about life and what it truly means.  To some of us it means being asses our whole life, to others it's just a day by day thing and to some life is beautiful.

       Forgive but never forget   So this is the phrase that has been running through my head today.  I'm not sure why I'm so interested in this phrase.  I think that with all the things that are going on in the world today that something like "the comment" shouldn't be taken so to heart.  I think that I want to know that all my relationships...wether friendships...workships...or any other type of ships need to be in "okay" status.  Granted that I will never forget what was said about me I still feel that I need to start forgiving people but I also need to forgive myself for some of the things that I have did in the past and still continue to do.  I am not the most perfect person and I shouldn't expect anyone else to be.  Maybe this is just a growing experience for me since I have seen some type of silver lining at the end of the situation.  I can be the bigger person and forgive but I can also never forget.   Laura   I never want you to think that I would say anything about you in a negitive light again.  I know that you and I have had huge disagreements but I'd like to think that we have grown to a great relationship.  You above all people have been there for me in this call center.  I greatly appreciate that.  Especially, since you called me to resolve things when you thought I was talking about you.  Remember that I am always here for you and I hope or know that I can say the same about you.  You are a wonderful person and I want you to know that you are appreciated.  Thank you so much my big butt muffin!!  Love Ya!!  Paul

       The Queerest of the Queer   Yeah that's right...the queerest of the queer.  You know what I have just about had it with people worrying if I'm a closet case.  It's like if you are that interested in who I am trying to fuck then come and ask me.  Don't just make conclusions on your own.  Yes this means you Nazilla.  How dare you say that shit in Tasha's review.  Especially in front of Tasha and Desi.  I don't understand where people get off saying "Well don't worry about trying to get with him because he's gay...right?"  You know just because I don't go around trying to fuck every single woman that I see doesn't mean shit.  I have respect for myself and when I'm ready to give it up then I will.  And to think that I gay just because you stereotype people to be that way if ignorant.  Do I need to get some type of tattoo that says "I not fucking gay" tattooed on my forehead?  Huh?  Is that what it is going to take?  Obviously so!  I thought that I had a wonderful relationshiop with someone but I see know that I was just to blindsighted.  The person doesn't even want to take up for the wrong doing that Nazilla has done because they don't want to be wrapped up in that "shit."  You know what if it were you I'd fully be there 100% to back you up.  Especially, knowing how much this issue has effected me over my 22 years on Earth.  But such is life.  Anyway...I'm getting off here to go to bed and hopefully tomorrow will be a better day.  Love ya'll bunches...Paul

       Thank God   So I want to start out by saying that Ms. Pat is cancer free.  Thank God!!  So that is over with.  I'm so glad!   May 8,  2003   Woohoo!  It's surgery time.  I'm putting in for my leave of absence right now.  I wish I could work but this is the farthest I've been in almost a week.  To the basement on the computer.  Ugh.  But anyway I'll talk to you all later.  I don' have much to say because I haven't been doing much except getting ready for this damn surgery.

       Bad news always seems to be the case   So last night my dear friend Ms. Pat came into work.  We were talking back and forth about me having Thrush mouth and blah blah blah.  Well Ms. Pat tells me that she has something to tell me.  She tells me that she has cancer.  I'm like stop lying Ms. Pat that's not funny.  Well she wasn't lying.  I'm devistated.  I'm sad.  I'm full of anger that this has to happen to her.  She is such a wonderful and joyful woman.  I love her just as if she were my own grandmother or even mother.  She brings so much positive energy to work when she is here with us.  To hear this was like hearing that a family member just died.  I cried for 45 mins at work last night.  I had to leave the call center and just breathe.  The news was almost too much for me to handle.  To actually grasp that she is living with cancer and the outcome as of right now is not so sure is haunting my mind constantly.  I've just experienced the loss of someone to cancer...Uncle Gene.  I don't want her to go through what Uncle Gene had to experience.  It was hard enough seeing Uncle Gene wither away but I am so close to Ms. Pat.  It is like all I get to hear anymore is bad news.  Bad news is always the case...at least these days.  Between Constance getting attacked by the bottle throwers...Uncle Gene passing away, knowing that my grandfather doesn't have much longer because his health is depleating, and now Ms. Pat.  It's like how does one deal with so much bad...when will the good actually shine through?  Ms. Pat isn't scared though...I've talked to her several times lately since she told me.  I'm scared for her though.  I want to be there for her...if it comes down to it I don't want her to worry about having to be alone and I'm willing to live with her if her illness is irrepairable.  I've already told her that my parents said we could take her dog Bailey if something should happen.  Her world revolves around her pets.  She said that she would have to have Sassy put down because she would greive to death.  I want her to know that Bailey will be in good hands and a good home if something should happen to her.  I pray to God that she will be able to fight this disease and be the victor.  And for anyone who reads this page please...I beg of you please say a prayer with all that is in you that Ms. Pat will triumph over this.  She is a beautiful, talented, caring, loving, ball of sunshine and I don't want to see her light diminish.    So God...if you happen to read or know what I am going through dealing with this news please I pray to you take care of Ms. Pat and see through that she overcomes this and stays with us and brings us the happiness that she always has.  I love you Ms. Pat and pray for you everyday!!  Much love to Ms. Pat and everyone that I never get a chance to say I love you to!  Paul

       Carroll "Gene" Cogle   It's been several days since you've gone But to a higher place your soul was drawn.  You will be missed in ways that you will never know You've made me learn more about life and helped me grow.  Always ready to share with April and I a story You found humor to be your glory.  I know you hurt but you were so strong It almost had seemed like nothing was wrong.  Sitting there with you and April at the table was great Just watching you smoke with every puff you'd take.  You knew it was bad of course we all do But it brought you joy and brought us closer to you.  Please know that you will be truly missed my me Late night chats over that damned t.v.  You told stories that showed how great you were Whether it be fishing, smoking, or hunting animals for fur.  I wish that you could still be here with us But you are in God hands now to he we must trust.  Vic, Amy, Chris, April and I will never forget you Don't forget about Prince and Precious too.  I wish I could have had more time to spend with you Gene You were so wonderful, happy, could never be mean.  I woke up this morning thinking of you being so strong And in my head repeating a song.  I know that it was you who put me back on path Thanks for talking to God for me so there wouldn't be a wrath.  So to you I say thank you and blow you a kiss For you are deep in my heart and someone I will truly miss.  Dedicated to Uncle Gene....Although he wasn't a blood relative of mine I still wanted to let him know a couple of things.  And for those of you who don't know who Uncle Gene as it was April's oldest uncle who her and I had been spending time with lately.  Although some of the things in this poem probably won't make much sense to you they do to me.  I've been going through some rough couple of days.  Last night I prayed to God that he would just take me away.  I really didn't realize how selfish I was being.  What it would do to my parents, friend, family and other loved ones.  What was I thinking.  This morning I woke up and couldn't stop thinking about Uncle Gene and how strong he was through his whole illness.  Then out of the blue I start thinking of Aaliyah's song "Dust youself off and try again."  Well to me it was Gene telling me to be strong and that all I have to do is dust myself off and start anew.  No matter how bad I ache and hurt that I can always start over.  I don't know maybe I'm crazy for thinking this but I'd like to think that Gene was the one telling me this because I saw what he went through for the most part and he was strong.  So so strong through the whole cancer thing.  I've decided to not let illness get the best of me.  Instead of wishing for God to come wisk me away in the night to just have a better mindset.  To be thankful that I'm even alive and that I have those people around me that care for me.  So this is just a big THANK YOU to Uncle Gene for getting me back on the right path and letting me know that I can be just as strong as him and one day I will be better and free from pain...just like he is now!    I just want to say that even though I wasn't related to you Gene that I had much love for you.  I can't help but sit here and cry.  I can't imagine how hard this has been on April and her family.  I'm sorry that I haven't been much help to you lately April.  I hope that you are doing okay.  I also wanted to put this in my journal to let you know that I know Gene is with us...I feel like it's almost that he knew what I was going through mentally and he has come to show me that I am a stronger person than my mind is letting me be.    So in my last words to you Uncle Gene are:  I love and miss you but also thank you for a new day!!

       Wait a minute   So I was proofreading my blog and guess what I have one more comment to make about the designer clothing.  Well April and I have come up with some clothing lines for and exclusive group of people.  FAT PEOPLE!!!  They are everywhere...I'm actually a proud member myself.  Here are the titles:   F.S.F.P.  =Fuck Skinny Fat is Pretty(Clothing for men and women that are plus size...i.e. jeans, shorts, shirts)  F.F.  =FuckaFatty(Lingerie for plus size women and boxers for plus size men)  FatForm  =Shoe line made especially to support Fat Forms (i.e. Me and April and the rest of the billion of other fat bastards they need extra support for our tubbage)    Doesn't that sound lovely?

       2 hours and 48 minutes   That is exactly how much sleep I have had so far today.  I finally fell asleep at 4am and woke back up at 6:48am.  What the hell is wrong with me?  I'm like in and out of consciousness right now.  I did eat a nutrigrain bar with strawberry yogurt gunk on the inside.  It was good...hopefully it will give me some energy to make it through the day.  I'm getting ready to watch I Spy with Eddie Murphy...I rented three movies that are due back today and I haven't watched one of them yet....except for like 45 minutes of Jackass The Movie.  Ewww!!  The part where that guy takes a shite in a plumbing store and they show his shite is disgusting.  I don't want to look at my own shite much less someone elses.  But alas, it's Hollywood.  I think that most moviestars are on the same brain waves as Anna Nicole they just hide it better.  Some of the stuff they do makes me wonder if they are even of this planet.  I think they are primates dressed in designer clothing.  At least a good bit of the Hollywood crowd.  But why am I talking about this shit at 7:14 in the morning?  I don't know...I've gotta go lay back down.  The eyelid caper is trying to make me see black for a couple more hours.  Good Night...even though it should be Good Morning!!  Paul

       Good Lord   It's only 9am and I am tired.  But I have to head out to a doctor's appointment to set up my surgery.  Ugh.  But such is life.  I'm planning for the surgery today and getting my referrals today to get the dreaded MRI and EMG (Electro Magnetic Graph) or something like that.  All I know is they poke you with these needles like you are a turkey on Thanksgiving day but instead of seeing if you are baked and ready to eat they check your nerve waves.  Blah!  I don't wanna...it hurt like holy fuck last time.  But I've gotta.  I'm going to try to work today to make up for some hours that I have been missing.  Okay I'll admit it I haven't been to work but one day in like 12.  But what can I do.  Oc's didn't work so what else is there to turn to.  STREET DRUGS!!!  Just kidding.  Weed would probably do better anyway.  But it would only be used for medicinal purposes.     I'm actually missing work.  I haven't seen anyone.  I was looking forward to seeing Constance on Saturday but she hasn't been back yet.  I asked Desi how she was and she said okay but I figured that she probably didn't want to be bothered.  But after reading her journal today I wish that I would have called or something.  But just to let you know Constance I did ask about you and kept you in my prayers.  And I just wanted to let you know honey bun that Desi had said you called you brother or something...I think it is when you found out Sarah was in B'more.  That's probably how people thought you called your brother I don't really know.  But my God I wish that I knew you were being serious.  I feel partly to blame for like not calling Angel's house.  I thought to myself I don't think she'll walk home but she will probably go to Angels.  I wish that I would have called your cellphone or something or just clocked out and took you home.  I hope that you realize that I thought you would just want time alone.  I didn't know what to do once again so I figured that I'd see you at work but I'm guessing that you need time to chill or something.  I'll give you a call tonight and maybe if you want we can go to the movies or chill and watch a movie at your house tomorrow night.  But please don't think that I wasn't thinking about you.  I love ya girl and you know that!!  I'll write more later...the fucking stupid ass doctor's office switched to a new location and not even mapquest has the directions to get there.  I feel and Adventures in Babysitting feat coming on....but the bad news is that it is with my parents!!  I'll be babysitting them because they are already fighting on how to get there.  Lord please grant me the patience to not swerve into on coming traffic.  Later ya'll

       When the shit didn't hit the fan but everything else...   You know that I usually only write once a day if that...but there has been a huge change in events today.  The shit almost hit the fan!  Here we go...  My mother is in the basement...Lucky (my dog) is upstairs...I'm in bed....Dad's in bed.  Lucky proceeds to shit everywhere with diaherra.  Talk about gross.  So after she shits everywhere she decides that it would be neat to paint or leave her shitty mark all over the house.  I think that the art side of me is rubbing off on my dog because she used her tail to paint the walls and draperies as if she were the next Michaelangelo or Di Vinci.  Thank God I shut my door!  She got shit all over the dining room walls...the guest bedroom(my mother had to through away the pillows because they were covered in shit).  But the best part of all is that when my father woke up this morning...not knowing what was going on...he stepped in dog shit!  What a wake up call!!    Wise grasshoppah say dat:  When you foot land in da shit firs ting in morning ecspect shitty dai!!!!!  How friggin hilarious is that?  But so far as I know his day hasn't been that shitty...just rainy and wet.    I've had 14 cups of coffee in about and hour so I'm wired.  Just thought I would share this dirty little story with you.  Later :)~

       What the FUCK?   Is it just me or am I getting tireder and tireder (  I've decided that even though I told Cyn she could possibly be the funniest person in the world that I've changed my mind.  I think that I deserve that title.  Or maybe it is just that I amuse myself too much when I'm alone.  And no this does not mean masturbation...it means I get all these crazy thoughts in my head and crack the hell up thinking when no one is around.  Like for instance when I had Baby Girl out this morning...she has the problem with obedience when it comes to digging at the carpet.  Well I caught her digging up the carpet and I held her in my hand and told her no.  I know this sounds crazy but I think she is starting to get it.  She only digs at one corner of the wall now instead of like the whole room.  So progress has been made.  So anyway...my mother bought me this thing that has wheels that you don't have to put on and I didn't use them.  So I figured that since I had for wheels and the rat has four legs I would make them into roller skates.  Then she wouldn't be able to get around the room to eat the carpet.  She could got roller skating in the kitchen.  Ceramic tile is a good surface to go skating.  Now do you see what I mean?  Who thinks of this shit...putting video stand wheels on a rat to go roller skating.  It would probably break her friggin legs.  But I'm really thinking of going to Wally World and buying two pair of Barbie skates for her....I mean actual Barbie DOLL skates not Barbie toddler skates.  Then my mother will have to crochet her a scarf because I'll get her ice skates too for the winter.  See there I go again with that stupid shit.  But I still have to wonder if it would work?  You think?  Let me know?  Last night I mean't April at the river to have a couple of Smirnoff ice's.  So we are sitting there and:  April:  We can't drink here the cops are always coming here and checking for that shit. Me:  Fuck that bullshit.  Drink.  (Paul opens his drink and so does April) WHAT THE FUCK?------>As soon as we each take like two sips the cops come.  They didn't do anything but it's the WHAT THE FUCK principal!!    So anyway we wind up in the Food Lion parking lot and I'm all drinking at Mike's hard lemonade 24ounce.  April won't drink she was afraid that another cop would come and she can get in trouble for that shit...so I don't blame her.  I finished my second drink.  I was feelin' loose but not buzzed.  So April gave me another ice and I finish that...then we go back to the river.  I head to 7-11 to get some Boone's(

       Tent of Imagination   So my father bought this big tent to go on the back porch so we could eat dinner out there without rain, heat, and bugs.  It has become the tent of imagination since I do nothing but sit at home all day and night.  Rose, my really for real crazy aunt said that it seemed we were in Egypt and that she could hear camels coming to pick her up.  April said now all Rose needs is a turbin and to desert boys to fan her.  And the cigarette ashes on the table have now become the sand in the desert that rose and I have been staying in all day for the hell of it.  I think tomorow it will be a fashion show tent and Rose and I will change outfits and bust through the curtains that surround the damn thing (it is a fucking damn thing since it took forever and five days to put up).  We will be like the models in "Head over Heels" the movie but more spectacular.  We have fun dreaming up new adventures to where the tent is taking us.  Kee-mo-sa-bee says:  To infinity and beyond.  May your tent stay with you and Rose and adventures be ah' plenty.  This tent is taking over our lives.  It's just one of those crazy things.  Tents+two fucking crazy ass people=adventures of those who seem like they are on crack but are not.  Later ya'll....more details about our adventures if they happen!  Love ya'll....Paul

       The Amazing Cyn   I really cannot express how muh Cyn's website seems to perk my day up.  To me she is one of the funniest people that I've ever not met but may meet this summer.  Haven't heard from her though because she's in Oberlin.  I read my dad the thing about Buffy Spoiler and he for once laughed his ass off.  Thank God for you Cyn...you actually got a laugh out of my father.  If anyone reads this who doesn't know where this website is...it's www.pinkhairedgirl.com !  It is kick ass!   If I were a balloon I would be high   Yes that's right...I would be high if I were a balloon.  Coming off these damned painkillers is like trying not to eat the piece of Cheesecake Factory cheesecake from Ruby Tuesday's.  Oh the torture.  But I'm doing really good.  I'm down from like 8 a day to like 3-4.  My back was swollen last night so I took 2 instead of 1.  I think I did too much yesterday.  I mean come on I got out of bed...went to Bonton and spent $120 on clothes, Nautica visors, and CK Undergarments and then went to April's work and sat and then took Amanda her graduation present.  I got her a 14k gold white cat and gold cat that are holding paws charm and a 14k gold necklace.  Let's just say the credit card is off limits as of right now.  Between myself and the gift I spent about $220.  So tolerance Kee-mo-sa-be is the new phrase.  But I can only charge stuff because I only have like 20 bucks in the bank...This will be quite the feat.   Whoa Momma...where did you learn to shop like that?   My mother was the shock and amazment of yesterday.  She went to Bonton for a bra.  Two boulder holders.  Two Keepumfromflappin.  But NO.  Momma must of listened to you better shop around before she went into the store.    She tells me before entering the store "Remember only let me buy a bra."   I'm like: "Yeah..you're telling the person with no self control for shopping.  Come on I bought a stuffed animal that laughs the other day just for shits and giggles and I have no money as it is."  So we are in the shoe department and she spots them.  A pair of sandals that are wonderful and of course I'm all like..."Those look really good on you I think you should get them in the tan and possibly the black."  But then I start pointing out other shoes.  She tried on like 9 pair but only bought the one.  I have this think for women's shoes.  Not that I want to wear them it's just that I think they are niftier than sneakers.  Plus they come in so many shapes and sizes!  Oh the temptation to have had her buy two pair of shoes.  So then we move on to the men's department.  I'm like Father's Day!!  She's all let me pick out everything.  She picks out four tops for my father for the summer.  She paid for two and I the other.  But she was persistent that she pick them out.  Damn...I had to buy shit that I didn't even have a say in.  She was all Evil Chinese Judge like:  My verdit is you will buy everyting you see he you bad whi boi!  Oh-K.  Dat is wha' I thaw whi boi you do as ah big ah momma say!  And of couse I obey.  So then I go get two new pair of my CK's!  And I spot sunglasses.  I'm trying them on and she is all like they are crooked.  I think my nose is deformed.  So I start looking at visors.  Anyone who knows me knows that I don't do hats, or visors.  My mom comes over and is all like "Oh that is a nice visor. BUY IT!  BUY TWO OF THEM!"  I do.  So now I'm learning how to wear visors...not that you need an instruction manual.  Then we are walking toward the bra's which we orignally came for.  Amanda's grad gift and two bras.  And I see two southpole tops.  I'm debating in my head.  I don't want to show interest because I know she was in one of those Hollywood Starlet modes where money is just trading dirty paper for fabulous goods.  She can see in my eye the interest.  She is all like..."I know you want them...I'll buy you one...GET IT!  I wind up buying two and paying for both...how the hell did that happen?  Mothers!  So the end of this story we get to the bra section and they only have one 38DD to fit her big ol' boobs.  And we check out.  Great right?  She spends like $200 and me like $220.  Wonderful we are leaving the store and I'm like "Dad is going to kill us...he knows when we come to the Bonton we always get in trouble."    Here is the best part.  Yesterday if you were a Marquis Member(which it states on your card you got an extra 20% off) plus everything was like 25-50% off.  My mother and I used to be Marquis Members.  They sent new cards but we through those away and kept the ones that said we were Marquis members.  So we got an extra 20% off everthing when we really weren't supposed to.  Is that stealing from the company...Oh well!  So here is the bestest part and the moral of the story.  My mother says after I inform her of Daddy Drama!  I have to bold this because I love her theory...oh and she bought a ruby bracelet.  "JUST THINK I CAME HERE FOR TWO BRA'S AND THEY ONLY HAD ONE.  ALSO WE CHEATED AND GOT THE 20% DISCOUNT.  SO WE SAVED MONEY AND I HAD TO FIND SOMETHING TO REPLACE THE BRA THEY DIDN'T HAVE FOR ME.  I'LL TELL YOUR FATHER I COULDN'T HELP IT BERT...ONE BRA WAS JUST NOT ENOUGH I HAD TO REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING...I MEAN SOME THINGS...AND BESIDES I WORK TO DAMN HARD TO HEAR YOUR MOUTH...SHUT UP YOU GOT CLOTHES OUT OF IT...AND IF HE TRIES TO SAY ANYTHING TOO LATE WE ALREADY HAVE THE GOODS AND THE RECEIPTS...HE CAN'T DO SHIT ABOUT IT BECAUSE I HAVE THE CARD AND RECEIPTS AND HE DOESN'T....BRING IT ON BIG POPPA!"  I'm totally for real.  But knowing that I'm not working now I'm trying to think of what my excuse could be but so far he has seemed obilivious to my shopping spree on his dollar since my parents are paying my bills until I go back to work in June.  Thanks Dad for the indirect Christmas present/Birthday present.  I have a feeling Santa is going to be sparse with presents this year...Nah!

       Remember Me?   Well it has been like over a week and I am finally able to make it into the basement to use the computer.  Oh what joy!!  I got an email today from Cyn in Philly...she has her own blog... www.pinkhairedgirl.com !  It is absolutely fabulous.  She said that she would love to meet April and I.  I hoping to get Tricia from work to go with us since she is the one who got me hooked on the website.  My back surgery went well.  Except for the muscle spasms that happened that night and the following day.  They had to give me something that is ten times stronger than morophine.  I don't remember much because they said that it would block out my memory.  That's a good that.  I want to say thank you to all the people who responded to my previous blog.  I know that I didn't get to mention everyone but remember that just because I didn't mention you by name doesn't mean that I don't love you.  Tasha!!  I hope we get to see each other again!  I would love to do lunch or something.  Girl you made me happier than you know.  You are crazy girl and please don't think that I don't think or want to see you again because that is the opposite.  I would love to do lunch when I get some money.  I only have 55 dollars left compared to the 2 grand I usually keep in the checking account.  Surgery is not only expensive but it wears out what little bit of money I did have saved up.  But who cares as long as I better.  Erin!  You know I still gots love for ya!  Never think other wise.  And yes when I read the comment Fam I Ly!  I almost pissed myself.  Ha..ha..that was at Thanksgiving about two years ago!  That was one of the funniest things that I have ever witnessed in my life.  I love and miss you!  And just to wrap this blog up because I can't sit down that long in this chair...I have to lay down for like 30 min. then stand for like 10 and on and on and on and on!  I just wanted to say that the Terrerium of Terror is doing wonderful and that it hasn't managed to eat me yet....and I haven't shaved in almost two weeks!  I look like Sasquash!  Big foot whatever!  Later to all my people!!  Loves Ya all!  Paul

       Minnie.......Minnie Ripperton   Do you know who this is?  Probably not...unless you know me.  This is the hooch who sung...."Loving You...is easy cuz you're beautiful."  I can't get the fuckin song out of my head and I haven't played it since last weekend for my aunt and to torture my father.  He really hates this song...when I bought Minnie Ripperton's greatest hits I made sure that it was the first to hit the cd player on the way back from Best Buy....my father was in the car and I blared the song....he yelled at me and told me that it needed to be turned down or off because I shattered his ear drums(   What I have to say...   So I'm driving and I like what if something happens during the surgery and I never get to see my friends and families faces again?  Well for those of you who read this I want to send some little shout outs and you can pass them along if you want just so people know that I do think of them.   April   The song title that comes to mind for you is "You are my sunshine."  Don't even ask.  You make me laugh more than anyone else has ever done or ever will do.  Our little Lucy and Desi spats (which are all fun) seem to be getting more intense everyday but damn most of the stupid shit we say to each other could be put on Tee shirts and you know this.  You make me happy.  You make me laugh.  You make me love to have someone around even when I don't want them to be there.  You are my sunshine...especially when I'm depressed but you some how bring me through the rain.  We never say this to each other but maybe in the "Be careful getting home" everynight but do know that I truly love you being my friend.   Amanda   Turn your desks to face the person sitting next to you.  This is your new buddy.  That is always what comes to mind when I think of you.  That first day in Phillips class.  Who would have known that he would have made two totally similar personalities bond that day and now five years down the road they are still bonded.  You, Amanda are my twin...since we are both Gemini's.  I think that we have found each other while most other Gemini's spend forever searching for that balance to their personality.  We compliment each other with stupidities and sarcasm.  You too make me laugh the living hell out of myself.  Whether it me Product Patrol or Carcus Control we are always ready to have a good time.  I'm really proud of you dealing with school and now having a baby!!  I'm really excited because I get to see this baby from the get go.  Loves Ya!   Constance and Sarah   While we aren't even as close as we used to be I do truly miss you both.  I know that you are doing well.  Desi told me that you are both doing really well and I'm so glad to hear that.  And for all the times that I didn't say it Constance I do miss you.  I know that it doesn't do much justice now but hey at least you know.  Constance you are too cute...the thing I love about you is the way you love to take care of people.  No matter what they, I mean I did to you.  I could have stabbed you and damnit you would still be there for me....you truly are blessed with the notion of nurturing.  Sarah, girl you are so much crazier than I thought.  You bring out the bad side of me...the sexual side.  And for that, I'm really glad because I don't get to see it that often.  You make people relax and have a good time and just chill..!!!  I love you both like my little sisters and you know this!!   Desi   Even though you told me not to write about you anymore in my journal wether good or bad I going to break the rule this time.  The song that I think of when I think of you is "At Last."  I know this is your wedding song....well I'd love to be the one on the other side of your arms when you dance to this.  Hint...hint.  I know you probably know that I have feelings for you that you cannot return because you aren't into me like that but, it's still nice to know that I have you as a friend.  You are so beautiful to me.  I don't know why.  To this day the first time I saw you I know my heart skipped a beat...and how long ago was this...when I worked at AB&C before I got fired the first time.  You make me laugh, work hard, enjoy work, mad, sometimes sad...but it doesn't matter because your friendship is well worth it and I know that half the time it's not me it's just frustration.  Don't let people hold you back because you are an asset to this world even though others are trying to discourage you.  Much love to you from the very core of my guarded heart.   Susan   "Keep your nose clean."  That should be a song because that is what you do for me and I so appreciate it.  You keep me in line and have faith in me no matter what I do.  You always tell me that I can do it.  Unless it's something that wouldn't keep my nose clean.  You are wonderful.  Probably one of the few people who know me better than my family.  You are CRAZY...but in a good way.  You make work so much fun for us!  You don't even know.  I love you just like a big sister who is watching out for her little brother.  "Oh my god Paul take me to your house and fix my hair.  What the fuck did she do to me?"  That was one of the funniest things ever!  You know what I'm taking about!  It's something that I think of all the time about you...what a big step that was!  At least you have something from me that you will have forever...the tat!  "Love Ya Babe"(   Samantha   I feel like we are in the movie "Clash of the Titans" most of the time.  Lord do we butt heads.  But it's so funny how none of that matters at the end of the day.  And we just go back to joking around.  You make my blood pressure boil girl!  But it's so worth it...who else would I argue with and then turn around and shoot a rubberband at!  I mean come on.  The thing that I enjoy about you is that you have stories upon stories and it's almost like damn this girl needs to write a book just about her mother.  Your stories are hilarious and you keep me laughing.  It's been almost three years of laughter.  Keep them stories comin' girl!   Ms. Pat   "The only rule is...is that you can't say fish!!"  Damnit...I was the one frying the shit!  So I should have been given another chance.  You know?  Woman you are my grandmother that I lease out to other families.  You have made me laugh to I've almost pissed myself...remember the time I even choked and had to leave the call center because I was laughing so hard that I almost passed out in the hallway!  "He had his legs removed from the knees up!"  You give me so much support and tell me to basically say "Fuck it" when things go shitty.  Lord what I wouldn't give to have known you in your 20's!  We would have made some crazy music around town!  I love ya Ms. Pat like you were my very own Grandmother!!   Tricia   I owe this blog to you.  I never really show much emotion when it comes to not being funny.  You introduced me to blog! and I am so greatful.  Without it I don't know what I would do.  You are so quirky, hilarious, and relaxed.  You remind me of my Aunt Ganda!  And that does say something because not many people live up to her personality.  Remember this..."Oh my god she had the worst headache of ever so I was all like I'm ACD Coordinator on the weekends...I let her go home."  What fun was that one!  I felt like it came out of a Lucy and Desi show!  Plot well and everything will be okay said the wise grass hopper!!     Angel   Maybe one day we will be rich off of the fat bank idea!  Who knows?  You are my Rice Patty Yellow Spice Girl from C Town!  I am telling you what sometimes you make me want to have an ethnic change surgery and become Asian!  I know that sounds stupid but you make me crack the fuck up with "Lil Chinese Asian Girl..." starting out most of our conversations.  Even though you have been stressed out beyond belief you still keep a positive outlook on things and I think that I'm slowly but surely starting to adapt that part of your character into my own.  And for that I thank you.   Laura   If there had to be a song for you make a guess what what it would be?  (   Mom and Dad   Even though I know you don't read this I still have to include you.  I mean you did bring me into this world by emaculate conception!  Even though I see like a bad ass, temper driven person most of the time I do love you both more than life itself.  I'm just fickle when it comes to my temper.  If changes from minute to minute.  To Mom:  You are so so strong.  You have been through hell and back but there is still happiness in your voice.  Not many people can say that they have a mother that is as strong as you but I do.  To Dad:  Remember, I do love you!!  I know that you want to hear that more often and it always seems like..."he doesn't love me."  But I do!  I'm just that type of person who can't show "love."  I'm better at showing friendship and stupidity.  Never think that I don't love you because that is utter bullshit!(   Granny   You will never ever know how much you mean to me.  You are my world.  The only person that I cry for when writing about.  I have so much love for you that it sometimes makes me just dread ever to know that one day you won't be here anymore.  I know people say that "they are off in a better place." But for me your better place is here...wether in Baltimore or Harpers Ferry.  You above all people I know have been through so much in one lifetime that most people would have never made it.  But you held on and I have you.  I wish I could keep you forever even though I know that you will watch over me no matter where you are.  I love knowing that when I come to your house that there is always a story to be told or some hell to raise!  It makes you one of the funniest people that I know.  You show me so much love in the little things that you say and do for me when I come to visit that it is enough love to last me the rest of my life.  I love you Granny.   Pop Pop   "GD...son of a bitchin..bastard ass shit!"  If you have never met my Grandfather this is what primarily is his vocabulary.  He is such a Grumpy old man!  I think that movie was made after him.  The thing I love about you is that you don't give a damn!  You remind me of Rhett Butler...."Frankly my dear I don't give a damn."  You are set in your ways and that is that...there is nothing that will ever change that.  But more so I respect you because you finally learned that some of the things you do hurt me and when I come around now you are more about having a good time and just talking...not pushing your opinions on me.  I love you for that!   To every other friend and Family member because my hands are getting tired and this blog is way too long and I've got to go   You all make me who I am.  Wether some of you see that as a bad person or a wonderful person it doesn't matter.  My whole being is made up of little snipets of your personalities.  I look for them.  Always look for who I've become to mimic.  I am who I am not only because of my own personal thoughts and ideals but because I've been influenced by some of the craziest, backstabbing, loving, caring, hilarious, and unforgettable people in the world.  I personally don't think that many people realize what debt is owed to those around them.  The debt is life...they are what keeps you going.  They are what makes you the person you turn out to be...not fully but they inspire you subconsciously.  They are what some take for granted or what some choose to abuse.  But for me they (friends and family) and what keep my world afloat.  So I know this is all heart felt and shit but I don't care.  I'm glad that I have the opportunity to leave my mark for the moment on the internet.  It will always be here for those I cherish!  So this blog is just to let you all know how much I really care for you incase something should ever happen to me.  Wether in surgery or thiry years down the road....it is here!  With much love from the one above....  Paul  P.S.  And for those of you who would have thought I would have left Aaliyah out!  Don't even go there!  She is my artistic influence and the voice that makes me know my angel was once on earth but watching over all of us in Heaven.  One love baby girl!!

       The Gift   Oh my God I just realized that the title I put down to write about something totally different is the movie I've been trying to think of the title of.  I know this probably doesn't make sense but whatever.  So I'm half asleep this morning and guess what?  My parents wake me up and they are all like:  Mom and Dad:  "Hey look at what we bought you!!" Me(in my head):  "This better be some good shit because I was steady sleepin!" Action movements:  I roll over and look and can barely see. Me:  "What in the hell is that?" Mom:  "It's a venus fly trap that you can watch after having surgery!"  Okay, did I just huff on some glue or is this like the weirdest present of ever.  After having my second back surgery all I can think about is watching a damn plant eat bugs!  I don't even like bugs...which is a good thing that it eats them but damn!  But I also have this fear that I'm going to be all debilatated(  I'm so crazy...I think Amanda's havin' my baby!!  Later ya'll

       Remind me again why you shouldn't get prescriptions filled at Wally World?   Because you will be there until Hell freezes over!  I called my father's prescriptions in like 3 hrs before I went there and still had to wait and hour to get them.  And at that they couldn't fulfill one of them.  What the hell?  I've come to believe that the people behind the counter are the ones with drug problems!    I'm totally groovin'....listening to music is the greatest!  I'm chillin...tomorrow is the big 23 yr old b-day!  So that I don't feel too old I'm listening to the lastest and greatest music!  Oh...and dancing in the chair!  It's almost like being at work...except there is really music playing...not just me singing in my seat and dancing!

       Dolce and Gabbana may not be coming   So I got the email receipt for my purchase yesterday and the damn sandals were on there but they didn't have a quantity or a price.  I don't think I'll be getting them...they say shipped as status but there is not charge for them.  Hey I'll take a $400 pair of sandals for free if that's what they want me to do.  That would be great.  Is this considered stealing?  Nah....I didn't think so!

       Your body is a temple....so worship it...damnit!   So last night I was going to place and order for these Armani boxer briefs and a matching cotton/spandex blend top for $138.00!  I'm so stupid.  I figured that my body is a temple so I should worship it and give it what it wants.  Well Armani wasn't exactly what I needed....I needed Dolce & Gabbana...DKNY...and Calvin Klein.  I only spent $193.00 and got way more.  I was supposed to go to Nordstroms today for their once a year sale...well that failed because it was only on women's and children's apparrell.  The men's sale isn't until the 13th of June.  So I went to www.solis.com !!  It is great!  Break it down:  2 pairs of CK's:  $12.99 each instead of the Bonton's $25.00 each = a savings of $24.02 and sales tax. DKNY Wallet:  orginally $38.00...my price $18.99 = a savings of $19.01 and sales tax. D & G Sandals:  orginally $409.00...my price $149.00 = a savings of $260.00 and sales tax.  So I saved $303.03!  See I'm a good spaver = shopper+saver!!  And your probably like Paul you are such and idiot to pay that much for those sandals...I know...it was impluse and a credit card...what could I do!  But they sandals are wonderful even though I haven't seen them in person yet!!  But when you are using a interest free credit card for a year it's really not that bad!  I'm gonna own a pair of Dolce & Gabbana sandals!  I can't believe it...this is my Annie moment...where I always thought it would be like Walmart shoes or Payless (which I still love)!  I got treated not tricked...I got kissed not kicked...   April and I's list of midget porn that we made up!   1.  We be munchin' midgets 2.  Munchin' midget mania 3.  Smidgin' midgets 4.  We be pimpin' midgets 5.  Ragu:  Rich and Meaty Midgets (Inspired by a can of Ragu spaghetti sauce) 6.  Mini Minute Midget Men (say that one like 3 times fast) 7.  Midgets don't mate they masturbate...  Enjoy!!

       Oh My God I've Gone Insane....Again   So it's not that I don't like water...it's just that when its been raining for the past 7 years that it starts to put a "dampen on your mood" (no pun intended).  I know that dampen is probably not a word but who cares.  I'm so bored I think that I'm going to go insane for real this time.  Life right now is not all that it is cracked up to be...I mean it would be if you were supposed to:  A:  Get out of bed B:  Go to the bathroom C:  Go back to your bed and watch t.v. D:  Eat and then possibly shit or piss E:  Go to sleep for the night  Doesn't that sound exciting guys?  Aren't you just dying for that type of lifestyle?  Me too!  Oh no wait....I already have it!  Lord what I wouldn't do for like some PCP or something to make me see things so that I could get away for awhile.  I wouldn't really do it.  You all know me way to well...(don't roll your eyes that's not polite).  So anyway I'm getting off of here to do nothing for the 4th week in a row....  From your bored and almost psycho pal...   Paul

       Why did I even stop writing?   I'm not finished yet.  Guess what comes on the television tonight?  The Golden Girls Reunion!  Oh my what wonderfulness!!  I'm too excited I think I may have to faint...shit let me get off this blog before I think of something else to write in a 10 min time span.  Well I've decided to edit instead of creating like 400 blogs today...it's now like 10:59am.  Here is an interesting article from yahoo's oddly enough:  LONDON (Reuters) - Move over Spider-Man -- mere mortals may soon be coming to a ceiling near you.   Researchers at the University of Manchester say they have cracked the secret of one of the reptile world's greatest climbers, the gecko, and produced a sticky tape that can mimic the lizard's gravity-defying abilities. Soon, people could walk on walls like comic-book superhero Spider-Man, the university said.  "The new adhesive -- gecko tape -- contains billions of tiny plastic fibers which are similar to natural hairs covering the soles of geckos' feet," the University said in a statement. "The research team believes it won't be long before Spider-Man gloves become a reality." Bob Full of Berkeley University in the U.S., which was also involved, said the technology could be used for handling computer chips and could have applications in medicine. Plans are under way to produce larger pads and to improve the tape's durability, said the journal Nature Materials, which published the paper. But the University said cost was currently prohibitive. "We have considered producing a large amount of gecko tape, sufficient amounts to enable a student to hang out of the window of a tall building," it said. "However it would cost too much money, and would not benefit us scientifically."   Hello?  I wonder if this tape would support me or any fat person?  The shit people come up with...   It's lunch time...umm   What yummy in my tummy can I create today that is low calorie and follows weight watchers?  Weird question number 5,265...Are the weight watchers watching their own weight and who the hell would want the job of watching weight?  See I told ya...I'd be back...almost like I'm on crack...ain't it?   Chicken and Cheesy melt sandwich on Weight Watchers bread and some mo' shit...   That's what I had for lunch.  It was low calorie and not that fattening.  It was like 5 pts.  Only 30 more to go.  So the question now is peroxide or hair dye?  Do I want to go black hair with red tones (peroxide) or total black (dye)?  I can't decide.  I think I'll try the peroxide first and if I don't like it I can always use the dye I have...such decisions that I must make in one days time.  Ha..ha..ha...I'm bored!    I just washed my blanket...God I love dryer sheets...they smell...perfu-riffic!   It's like 1:42pm and I've had an epiphany....maybe?   I've decided that the movie "The Rules of Attraction" could possibly be the most brilliant movie that I have ever seen...what the epiphany.  I love it.  Also there is a character named Paul Denton in the movie and that would be my name if my parents wouldn't have gotten married.  How cool is that.  I now have my real first name and my"parents unwed" last name in a movie.  Basically it's my mother's maiden name plus my first name.  Remember love children don't always wind up with the father's last name.  I just happened to be lucky.  I don't think they'll ever use my real last name.  It's too blah and can be way over mis-pronounced.  Until we meet a-gain! (   It's about 3:00pm   Guess what?  My hair is now medium to light brown....how exciting?  But I must continue my quest for light light brown hair!     It's 6:10pm and this is the last entry...   I cooked...now my back is hurting and I don't even want to eat what I cooked.  Isn't that the most fucky ducky thing!!  Later going to lie down!  Have a great night!  And my hair is light brown!

       The computer is your friend...it loves you and wants to marry you!!   I have just spent the last 2 hrs. on www.ilovebacon.com !!  This is sick.  I'm obsessed with that damn site.  Although when I got to the archive of a video with someone getting their tongue split in half I about puked!  It was 59 seconds...I made it through like 20 seconds before actually realizing what the fuck was going on!  It could quite possibly be the grossest thing I have everah everah seen in my life.  Please if you go to the site do not watch the video.  Who in the hell would want to have their tongue split in half.   Ugh? (  So this brings me to the conclusion that my closest friend is the computer.  Here are the reasons:  1.  I like the computer, except for that tongue video so the computer is my friend who I spend lots of time with while I'm off work. 2.  My computer loves me...it doesn't talk back it just takes me to places I enjoy...except for that tongue video.  (And porn sites are excluded...dirrty dirrty minds.) 3.  My computer keeps me engaged for hours and days at a time so the way I figure why not get married...I mean we are already engaged with one another.  My computer can't do anything without me...and I can't find stuff without my computer...but I really wish I hadn't found that tongue video.  You know I have way to much time on my hands!!  I guess it's better than snot!   Blogging ah go go   I've decided to blog throughout the day...because I figure that I think of something weird or interesting (at least to me) about every hour.  So why not spend the day on a blogging extravaganza!  All day blogging.  This should be interesting.  I'm getting something to drink...no food (diet...must starve oneself) and crashing in the basement for the day.  After all the 78" or something like that TV is down here.  TV and blogging...oh what joy!!  I'm sure that I'll at least have a couple of more paragraphs to add today!  Until then...bling bling on a swing swing oops the telly went ring ring!

       1...2...3...and 4 why can't I fucking snore?   That is this morning's question.  I went to bed at like 3am and have been up since 6:30am.  Why damn it?  Why me...Nancy Kerrigan?  I feel the use of 28 cups of coffee should do me today...not do me but do me well in the waking process.  I kept having muscle spasms in my side and my legs all night.  I think about like every 20-25 minutes.  They won't go away so now I'm up.  They have ceased...of course...now that I've only had like a total at most with each waking up of 3 hrs of sleep.  what the hell?    Last night I baked cookies with April and found out that men are like flowers according to her.  I'm an exotic flower man...or just a bossy ass man bitch who is high maintenence.  She told me I would be the one giving instructions in the household.  Here was my example:  "She bitch get in the damn kitchen and fix me somein' to eat!  Now!  I'm high maintenence and I'm famished so get to cookin."  That sounds more Diva-licious to me.  Hey I could live with being a Diva...as long as it can apply to men.  April told me she is looking for a cactus...you only need to water them once a month at most and if you don't feel like watering them they'll survive.  So before I got to April's house it was raining and I'm all about the movie "Twister" for some strange reason.  So I pretended that I was in the movie while driving.  I started yelling "Look at all the rainbands this is going to be one big bessy....possibly an F4."  Please tell me this is normal?  Then I decided I was a goddess and changed the message on my phone to reflect the events that had just taken place in the car.  (To me the God Paul doesn't sound as dramatic as the Goddess Paul).  My message is something like...:"Hello you have reached the Goddess Paul I'm not available right now I'm hunting tornado's since I was thinking about the movie it's my new career...so I'll call you back if I survive the twistenator."  I've really hit the jackpot on insanity with this stint.  Call me crazy but that isn't your average message.  Come on people have some creative minds when it comes to messages....step out of the "please leave me a message and I'll return your call" box.  Head toward the light...Carrol Ann...because today is a new fucking day and it's bound to be fabulous.

       You mean Harvard as in vay-kay?   What movie is that line quoted from...huh?  Well I got my vacation off from work.  Except that I have to call in one of the days as suggested by my supervisor and call center manager.  Which makes me wonder how suitable each is for their position.  I mean I've never had a supervisor or manager tell me to call into work.  But I think I have come up with a compromise.  Go in later that evening on the 7th of Aug.  around 6pm or so.  Hey it might just work and then I won't have to call in. (*Note: Remember if you have access to this site it is not to leave the site and go to work with you...these are just my personal thoughts and ways of venting when I'm frustrated...bring it to work and bring home the unemployment check...this is not a threat...think of it more as a promise that the government will uphold for me...I've done the research on this okay...okay)   I can see everytime I write about work I'll have to include my note of don't run your mouth...damn it.  I have an interview with Mamsi tomorrow at 1:30pm.  Can't wait.  I have to take some retarded test to make sure I'm call center material...umm hello I've only done this for a total of four years now.  I hope I make it to work on time.  And then on Tuesday I have an interview with Strayer University for admission.  Go Me!!  Off to Tammy's to go swimming...ker plunk...ker plunk!

       The stone cold facts   Hmm...hmm...hmm.  So this one time I was writing on my journal and I figured I was going to tell the people that I work with how I truly felt about them and I did but then erased it because I felt a nice wave come over me.  Well I was going to do that again tonight but I'm better than that.  Now don't get me wrong not all was bad.  I really enjoy working with 90% of the people that I call my co-workers/friends.  Don't make assumptions and think you are on the bad list because you probably aren't.  If you suspect you are on the good list you probably aren't.    I don't exactly hate my job.  I just can't stand to go.  I really loved my job when I was working ACD on the weekends which miracously is gone.  Who would have thought that.  Me!  I just think the politics and power trips that people have at the Alphabet Group is ridiculous.  I'm not mentioning any names I'm just venting because I think that everything is going to work out okay.   (*Note:  Remember if you have access to this site it is not to leave the site and go to work with you...these are just my personal thoughts and ways of venting when I'm frustrated...bring it to work and bring home the unemployment check...this is not a threat...think of it more as a promise that the government will uphold for me...I've done the research on this okay...okay)     I know that the people that I'm dealing with are doing their damndest to help me.  And I honestly appreciate the effort more than the result because other people would just say oh well and move on.     My time   This is my time to not be weak and take the back seat.  When you have dealt with two back surgeries over two summers and having to leave college then come and talk to me.  When you think you are having a bad day come to me and take a walk in my shoes...even though they wreak right now.  If you are willing to be in constant pain and not be able to feel the lower part of your right leg then be the frog and leap.  When you think that your parents are going to get a divorce because of you and you think it's true take over.  This whole thing, situation, drama is because for once in two years I can finally spend time with my parents and friends but as of yet it is being denied.  There is nothing worse than thinking everything is going wonderfully for once and then have it burst into shattered glass that can't be repaired.  I haven't caught a break with my health and emotions in over three years and now it's my time to enjoy life for once.  People say that it is "their time to shine" but I just want a couple of days of "my time to appreciate."  Appreciate what I have been missing out on for three years and take every moment as if it will never happen again.    I'm not bitter or going to go psycho.  I just want this moment...this time to enjoy life again.  When you deal with the issue of suicide for three years and you are in and out of depression for three years don't you think it's time for a break when you actually can say "I feel like a new person today."  You should not have to answer to what others think because deep down inside you know that what you are holding out for will make all those years of "dealing" disappear for a split second.  I would gladly give you the opportunity to take the walk if it could happen but I can't.  I don't regret for a single second thinking of suicide or being depressed because now I've grown and reached a different plateau.  A lot of people of reservations about me.  Whatever they are you have to look past my wonderful ability to be hilarious and realize that I can do what you are asking of me.  I've reformed myself so much at times that I didn't even know who I was and now I'm back to the me that I remember in high school.  If you can't take a joke or a goofy moment then you are the one that is dead inside.  I know that there is a time and a place to act professional and so on but if you play your cards right and let a little bit of that humor you have bottled up inside you escape I guarantee that people with enjoy you more.  Like I've said many times...I think that God has given me the gift to make that storm over other people's heads go away with my witty personality and fast comebacks.  It used to be that I would be so depressed that I thought "it could all end" but still I made the other people around me feel good about themselves while I was slowly falling apart inside.  I'm not saying I am better than anyone...but I am saying to not take me for granted (that's a little vain but who cares) because I know that I've brought bad times however, balance the good times, laughing, and the warm feeling that while everything isn't okay for that 10 seconds you forgot about it and you'll see that you have more of me with you that is good.  Friends have taken me for granted in the past (high school) and you know they have lost out.  That's why they are drug addicts and who knows what now.  I'm not saying that I have the power to change someone's future but I know that I can help keep it on the right track.  Summer is a perfect example.  I gave her my heart, mind, soul and anything she wanted and I was left behind...but, who is doing better now?  I'll never do that again...ever for anyone.  I can give you my love but never my heart.  It is dormant, empty and is guarded by the brickwall that was put there five years ago.  So just let it be known that if you ever need help or need someone to talk to I'm here.  Regardless, unjudging, and open minded.    I hope that when I do die that God gives my family and friend's children the piece of me that is still human.  And that piece is...the ability to show others bliss if only for one beat of their heart.  Touche...  Paul

       When I'm 99 years old   I'll have finally graduated college.  You know I could have had some killer classes this semester.  But no, my fill-in advisor had to pussyfoot around and wait until today to give me my pin number to register.  Now I can only get two classes.  And at that one is on Monday from 6pm-8:40pm and the other is on Tuesday and Thursday from 1:50pm-3:05pm.  There is this 499 class that isn't in the catalog that I may take on Wednesday nights if I could only know what ST:  Legislative Process is.  I think it's State Legislative Process.  If it is an internship I can't do it because of work.  I miss Hannah Geffert so much.  She is the best damn Professor of ever.  I applied to Strayer University in Manasas Virginia and they have called me back.  I want to major there in CIS (Computer Information Services).  So I may be going to Shepherd and starting some online courses there to occupy my time.  It's a start.  So I'll have a degree in Political Science in about fifty years and hopefully in about 2 1/2 years a B.S. in CIS.  If Shepherd doesn't learn to comply with me...there #1 student (don't hold back the laughter I'm cracking up) then I will start going to Strayer University full time in January.  But they have to give me some monies to pay for their classes because one class is like $750 and books for each class are from $100-175.  Bump that!  And Shepherd is getting carried away with the start date of classes I mean hello the 18th of August is like still considered summer even if it is late in the summer.    Why can't the world just revolve around a tubby boy with a knack for vanity?  Ponder that one...damnit!  Your always vain and loving bookworm at age 99,  Paul

       FLOACHES...   So at work we have been invaded by a mysterious bug that is found in the deepest, darkest, stained blue carpet in the world.  And it happens to be at my work.  Janetta, Angel and I have found out what has been biting the living hell out of our legs...FLOACHES.  Yes I tell you...FLOACHES!  It is a mixture of two species of bugs (*Note:  Extensive research has been put into our discovery).  Guess?  Well if you can't figure it out the mixture of FLOACHES is as follows:  1.  Roaches 2.  Fleas 3.  You have FLOACHES!!  Angel has been able to trap one and examine it throughly.  Their appearance is as follows:  1.  Six legs 2.  Black 3.  Mini tracks 4.  A gold tooth 5.  A machine gun...only on the ones that need anger management 6.  And there they are  Their theme song is:  FLOACH the magic flea bag...get it!!   Beware for the invasion of FLOACHES...because they are Free at last...free at last...   Because Angel, Someone, and I should be spies   We know that J-LO didn't call in to work today...but his/her car was in the parking lot when J-FO got off of work...Hmm!  Could they possibly being having a sexual escapade?  You make the decision.  And just to repeat it:  "Is that her car?"   Physical examination   From Road Rules on MTV:  Christina:  Donnell keeps on saying that I like his BOD-EE!  I've seen it and I don't like his BOD-EE!  I think Donnell needs not only a physical make over but a mental check up as well.  His BOD-EE belongs in the PAH-T!

       Beep...beep   Went looking for a new car today.  Found the one that I love and it was way too expensive.  What a waste of two hours.    I found a 2003 Honda Accord.  They wanted 5000.00 down and then 471.00 a month for five years.  Are they out of their fucking minds?  I think so.  My father said that if I could get like a thousand dollars together that I could get it.  It is so worth consideration.  It is fully loaded and just wonderful.  It is this weird shade of green that I've never seen.  But then Frank...the guy who repaired my Jeep says that Honda's if you should happen to wreck them state on their manual that they may not be able to blend the paint.  Because they make their paints specially or something...but Lord that car was nice and roomy and smelled so sweet!  For the love of Satan...I need a down payment.  Hmm...how many goats would I have to sacrifice for that much money?  If you should happen to worship Satan let me know...I'll consider it.  Later,  Paul

God Angel why do you have to have off on Wednesdays and Thursdays?  Please decide to come in tonight...and Tricia you are so right about shoo'ing a fly with the mouse...I've done that countless times and for some reason believe that it will work one day as long as I believe hard enough.   Now it's time to say goodbye to one of family...F A M (hoping your doing good) I L Y (hope to see you soon)   God Tasha why did they fire you already.  That is complete and udder bullshit.  I mean we need people and you had to take off yesterday to get a car to be able to get to work.  No sympathy.  I have your number and will call you tomorrow.  I'm so mad to see you go because it was fun working with you and talking.  If you need anything call me this weekend at work and I'll give you my home phone number and stuff.  I love ya and will miss ya...you my craziest friend of ever!  Off to watch reruns of Dawson Creek to discover new words I didn't know existed.  They have the vocabulary of Philosophers...what's up with that?  So I will leave you with this:  Here we are face to face A couple of Silver Spoons...do you remember that?  Paul

       God...Cynthia must be a mind reader...   Read the last paragraph of her blog today at pinkhairedgirl.com !  It is so what I was thinking about work the other night without the use of kitty pants and glitter eye make-up!     Today's question...okay I have several   Okay so if I should happen to be bi-polar (which my parents are convinced I am because I'm moody) would it be so bad to use that to my advantage and say knock the living shit out of someone and then blame it on not having medicine to control my bi-polarism?    Or would it be better to hire someone to take care of the dirty work? If you answer yes to this question, Please submit a resume with your ass kicking qualifications for review.  Thanks :)  Another day...another face to be blackened  Paul

After all when you can't find anything positive about your job any longer there is no need to be there and make your life miserable.  My parents think I'm bi-polar but I think that it's my FUCKING JOB!  Oh and having certain people as co-workers isn't that pleasant either when they wreak of "tainted cunt."  And for those of you that read my page...it's to remain on my page.  If I find that one lick of my personal thoughts and information is even whispered at my job I'll have your ass.  Don't bring it...because I am not the one!  After all, I do have Elaine on my side of the fence...because I have enough respect for her to tell her the truth instead of candy coating shit.  Elaine rocks!!  There went the stress!  Time...is on my side yes it is!!    Check ya lata...Paul

       It's a bug's life...   And I plan to end it.  What the hell is wrong with mesquitos?  Are they constantly dehydrated, anemic, or the modern day version of a vampire?  Please let me know.  I got bit on my middle finger last night at the river by a mesquito.  He is evil and I hope that he dies.  I can barely bend my middle finger...and that's not the best part...I have to type all day long with a swollen finger the size of a phone.  How is it that I can get bit on one of the smallest area's of skin on the body?  Huh?  A freakin' finger!  Well needless to say Mr. Mesquito decided to bring the Mesquito Bunch (Homage to Manieka..."There's a story of a chinless lady") and rip into my legs and arms and chest.  Lord what I wouldn't do for an atomic bomb that only effects a bug's life.  While the movie may be cute...in real life they are devils sent from Satan as a parting gift for those of us not getting into Hell.  I loathe them and wish them to die...but then I have to think "hey there boy wait a minute."  Without bees we can't have food so fuck that plan....forget all about it.   Chinless Girl   I know you know who I'm talking about if you were there.  Well I got together with her for lunch like 3 months ago and it was like attack of the obsessed ex-girl who used to like you in school.  She hasn't changed except for short hair and dressier clothing.  Sent her one email and then like 25 come back at one time.  Who's whipped now?  CHB (Chinless Hubb Boy) couldn't wait to lose that reunion.     You better work...work it girl...do your thing on the runway   And that is exactly what I will not be doing today.  I'll be at work...without a girl and runway.  Damn why do I have to go back?  It's punishment for not being hideously rich and famous isn't it?  Hey that's not my fault...make other people work in place of me to support me.  That way I could travel more.  You know getting to know different surroundings makes a person have a better outlook on life.  I have this obsession with Cambodia for the moment...and yes it is because of Angelina Jolie.  I want to go there and meet the people and see if I can do something to help.  When Angie was on Barbara Wah Wah or 20/20 Friday it made me want to go to Cambodia.  Plus they have some awesome temples that I would study the architecture of.  I'm really thinking of going there next summer.  Hopefully, I won't have to come back.  I could deal living overseas and only speaking English and being able to read Spanish but forgetting how to speak it.  Weird huh?  Anyway, I'm going to watch some television before I have to get ready for work.    Ya'll come back now...ya herrre!  Paul or CHB(

       God please tell me why...???   So I'm in training today...hello by the way, and this woman who's name I will not mention is wearing these shoes that are exposing all of her toes.  Someone tells me to look at her feet.  God please tell me why...???  Why did I look?  Why?  Why?  My eyes began to water and bleed!  Those was the most fucked up lookin feet I have ever seen in my life!  I thought she was part chia pet or some shit that has a talon as toes!  You know how some people can like bend the end of their finger and have the tip pointing down...well that is how her second toes were except for they resembled the length of fingers.  I'm thinkin' what the hell did this woman eat to get some "jacked up mothafuckin' long ass crusty Dr. Scholl's won't evah help" toes!  Her ass must have been eatin' some ghetto wheaties..."Needies" is what they was...cuz she need some help in the pedicure department.  I wanted to point at her toes and just scream at them.  I couldn't stop laughin' and she is tryin to talk and I'm just picturing attack of the killer toes.  Some fucked up shit ain't it.   h2o...here we go!!!   So my friend Chrissy asks me to go this bar in Hagerstown Maryland...for karoke...I'm like okay.  It was my first gay bar experience.  My friend April came...I was so GLADD (no pun intended).  We had a great time.  My favorite scene from the night goes like this:  Seth(gay karoke singer on stage):  If you give me money I'll git necked Some random gay man:  Take it off baby...just take it off! Some random lesbian:  I'll give you money to keep you clothes on. Some random gay man:  Don't pay attention to her she's just a big ol' butch dyke!!  I thought I would die...but then I didn't!  Obvious...huh?    Ergo, that was my first gay bar experience!  Going to go again!!  (*Note:  I had to use the word ergo because it was used today in some latin sentence Cignito, ergo sum=I came "therefore" I am!)  Always lovin' a big word in a little package...and that reminds me they had condom baskets at the bar!  I got Chrissy a yellow one and April and I red ones!  What a way to brighten up your day...a neon dick!!  Lata tayta!  Paul

Had to have a cyst removed from my lower back...near the ass actually!  *Couldn't sit at the computer. 2.  Had a car accident the night of the removal.  *Couldn't concentrate and ass was in no condition to sit.  Later,  Paul

       Experimenter   That was the result of the personality test yesterday.  It said something about me being dominant and blah blah blah.  Oh and that I love to cause trouble but also like to fix things.  I think that could be true.  But the experimenter part is so true...it said something like you will try anything once...anything.  That could be a really bad thing to have as a personality.    I have tried many things but I don't know if I have a line to draw.  I mean of course sex with animals, family members and other gross shit like that is duh out of the question.  But other than that I can't say that I wouldn't be up for anything.  I can't see myself eating raw tomatoes but like four months ago I ate them at Ruby Tuesdays and didn't have a problem with it.  Now I can't even think about a raw tomato without being sick.  And I'm sure we all know that I'll do any type of drug except for heroin...unless I was given it without knowing.  That is so scary...isn't it?  I don't think that I could do crack, crank, cocaine.  But here I am saying "I don't think."  That usually means you would do it.  Doesn't it?  No...I'm over the drug scene.  Really...the only thing I take now is a random pain killer for my leg and back...allergy pills, paxil, and sleeping pills.  Other than that...that's it.  See I also think that April would do anything at least once except for what I've excluded for myself.  The only other thing I know she wouldn't do is anal sex...but you never know?  Wink Wink...I'm just fucking around with you April.  She has swore off anal sex for those of you who do not know her that well....and she will never do it!  I'm really proud of her for biting!  I told you it was wonderful.  Now all you have to do is be bitten...I think you will find it very exhilariting.     I need some h2o   I really wanted to go to h2o last night but seeing that April and I didn't get to bed around 3 or 330am Friday night it was out of the question.  I feel asleep at 6 pm and got back up at 9pm.  Then went back to sleep at 1030pm and got up Sunday morning at 11am.  That's pretty bad.  I am in the mood to get messed up and shake some ass.  While Frank shook so much ass that even I was wore out...the temptation to go to the club is growing stronger and stronger everyday.  I really want a long island iced tea from h2o.  They are really good.  And they are huge and only 5 bucks.  Maybe next weekend.  Is it bad that I'm like really tired and I've only been up for like 2 or 3 hours?  I think not.  Tonight...the mission if I choose to accept it is to get drunk...like my mom did last night!  Ha!  In the words of the famous Bubble Malone:  Remember that one time that I..................................fucked your mom.....  Paul

       Shop-o-holic...   So I'm broke right?  Well I thought so but you know how appealing shopping is right?  So that's what I had to do...shop.  It's the cream to my coffee.  Today I managed to buy a lot of Todd Oldham stuff for my cubicle at work.  List-o-products:  1.  A miniture file cabinent 2.  A frame 3.  A set of three clip frames 4.  A clock 5.  A magnetic (cork) board  And since Frank and Dwayne do not have a bottle opener I bought them a really nifty red one for $5 and a set of two "friendly" sperm magnets for their kitchen they were $5 as well.  Altogether I bought like $90 worth of stuff for $47.  I am too good.     This is the picture I get for taking the gay test at www.thespark.com!  And the caption beside it says "Frank,  we need to talk...Now!"  April was like 38% gay.  Dwayne and I are 64% gay.  And Frank wound up being 65%.  It is all based on these really like weird questions that you can't help but not answer with a gay answer.  I getting ready to take the personality quiz.  Wish me luck.  Paul

       The adventures of Super Paul   Everyday seems to hold something anymore that I want to totally crack up at.  Even if it is not appropriate.  Like yesterday this woman was telling us about IT Systems department and she said the words...temporwary and sprecial.  I wanted to just bust out laughing in her face.  In fact, I actually giggled when she said it.  Oops!  Learn to talk and we won't have this problem.  At least I laugh at myself when I mispronounce a word and April will laugh right along.  Anyway...today I wanted to laugh at this claim that involved diaherra infection.  Why couldn't they just have put bacterial infection.  That's not so bad.  Ugh!  Well I'm going to eat dinner.  Is there something wrong with my sense of humor?  It's a little creepy when you find yourself laughing at medical terms...  Flow at ya later...  Paul...did you get the ending?

       MWAHHHHAAAAA   So I found out today that I am the greatest.  You want to know why don't you?  Well at work the people that are in my training class are all levels and levels below me.  I'm only two levels from becoming a Lead or Supervisor.  How great is that.  The other people in my class are around level 2-3.  I'm a level five in the ARS department which is the highest you can be signed on with.    So I checked the comments that I left on Kicking Puppies and Pink Haired Girl and everyone that has commented on me biting thinks it is hot and sexy.  I agree.  And they feel as long as I don't draw blood that everything is orgasmic.  He..he...he!  How great is biting now.  I think that the world needs to be bite more because maybe they would be in a better mood.  At least I know that I would.    I also discovered today that Erotica by Madonna is probably the most bestest song of ever.  It doesn't effect me as much as Mouth by Bush but damn I love the song.  I've listened to it about 50 times today and that was just on the way to and from work.  Work is going excellently and knowing that I make around 3-4000 dollars more than other people is great too.  God I'm so vain and selfish but that can be a good thing...  Well I'll write later if anything else interesting should happen!  Goodbye...farewell...get the fuck up out of my face...just joking...bite me!  Paul

       Just a little bite...   So is there something wrong with wanting to bite someone in a sort of sexual way?  Like biting their lower lip or their neck?  I find this extremely erotic and quite frankly, I would rather do that than anything.  Licking and touching and stuff is wonderful too but there is something so appealing about biting.  Not to hurt the person just to bite and be bitten.    I can't help but want to bite certain people.  Is this weird?  Some people I have considered:  Amanda, Jennifer, Suzanne, Jocelyn, Wendy Combs, Desi, Rhiannon, Katie and more recently EyeCandy.  Can't help it people...there is just something about these people that make me want to bite them.    I know this may be shocking to some people that I want to bite the lower lip or neck of a guy but oh well.  Has anyone else found someone of the same sex physically attractive?  Not that you want to fuck them or anything you just wouldn't mind a random nibble or kiss.  The thought of doing stuff with another guy is so not what I'm going for...I mean I've been there and tried it and it wasn't for me...talk about feeling dirty.  I'm talking about more than biting or a kiss.  Lord I can see the headlines now "Paul has kissed another guy!"  Get over it.  I have only kissed two guys before.  And one of them was George but I also kissed Heather right after.  Let's just say that alcohol had a lot to do with that night but it was great.  How can it be explained that I want to just have a random bite fest with EyeCandy?  I don't know.  I think maybe pharmones or something I can't really tell ya.  I just know that when someone has that something about them wether it be their eyes or mouth I get the urge to want to have a little fun in the borderline S&M department.  Whatever...I just know that I will get the chance to bite EyeCandy lip...ha...haa..haaa!  How dirty is that?  But oh how fun it can be...  With hugs and nibbles...  Paul

       Fade to black...   Well last night my hair was platinum and I was really okay with it for awhile but, I decided that black makes me look more human than looking like cornbread or margarine with blonde hair.  So my hair is now raven black...I mean like so black it's almost appauling.  So anyway, I didn't get all of my head when I was dying it so I have a blot of hair the size of a pea that is still platinum...but I think it adds character and now I resemble Mr. Sheffield from The Nanny only with the lighter hair in the back.  My bad!!  So I started my new job today and it is wonderful.  I mean I actually enjoyed being there today despite what my preconceptions were.  The benefits are outstanding and I get to roll over my 401(k).  They also have a prom in January for the company employees.  Everything is free...and they serve filet mignon and crabs for the entree...but I need a tuxedo and a date to go with me to Martins West.  Oh la la!  I need new clothes too.  I'm just not satisfied with my current selection.  I want wild and zany shit like from Hot Topic.  But first I have to get a pay check or two under my belt.  And I am so happy to be making like $850.00 every two weeks.  It's great and shoparific.    So April if you haven't figured it out already the body part is the lower lip.  Mmm...not so bad.  So there is the answer to the question about what I would enjoy have a bite at.  Biting does not equal pain unless you draw blood.  Which in my case my teeth are so sharp I'm surprised I haven't done that to someone yet.   Here is another reminder to all of you who need reminding...   Today is the 2 year anniversary of Aaliyah's death.  So that means that you need to light a candle sometime tonight in her memory.  And I mean it.  I did my part when I got my tattoo of "In Memory Of Aaliyah" so that I'm reminded everyday.  I know it sounds crazy but she is just part of who I am.  So to Aaliyah's friends and family again I am sorry for the loss that you have had to endure and I hope that each day becomes brighter and brighter knowing that she is still shining through her fans.     Quizzles for the fizzles...     you are a richotched emu! you are fun, lovable, and stupid. you deserve to burn in hell. or at least be bitten by a rabid gopher.    urlLink   What random phyco are you!?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      The Number Seven.    urlLink   What Random Number are YOU?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    hell yea i'd fuck you all night long !     urlLink Would i fuck you ?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Your: Mysterious eyes.

       Color me blondie...   That's right...color me blondie.  My hair is now all over blonde.  See what happens when you stay drunk all weekend.  I had the bright idea to bleach my entire head blonde the day before I start my new job.  It was all blotchy and shit but it is now a really bright blonde.  Remember the name Cornbread Jones...well my hair is the color of cornbread but I like it.    LMAO!  Paul

       How wonderful...   Thank you for the wonderful yet amusing comment Amanda.  Oh and no problem with the PETA link.  I'm trying to get a picture to go along with it but I haven't found the right one yet.  And thank you Tricia for saying those words.  The only thing is I think if I just be who and I all the time I would be a major slut or end up in jail!  But, damn could I have bitten someone last night.   Hickery village...   So I made my mother go out with me last night to meet up with my friend Chrissy.  She was at the Ace of Clubs in Inwood.  The bar is a total "thick as hicks" bar if not worse.  Chrissy was way beyond blitzed.  I tried to get my mother to drink but she knew that I would be totaled by the end of the night.  What I had to drink:  8 shots of Vodka 7 Bud Lights 1 shot of Southern Comfort 1 Tequila sunrise 1 Slow something that I can't remember  That is ridiculous.  Actually it was wonderful...all the way home I was singing out the window and trying to rap...let's just say that I had a really big void in the lyrics department last night.  I really wanted to do karoke last night but I was going to do rapper's delight.  Show those rednecks what I was made of.  But I couldn't think of the song until just like five minutes ago.  I highly recommend hick bars.  There were a lot of big bootie hoe grannies there shakin what their dead mama's gave them.  And teeth are not a pre-requisite (I'm really not feeling this spelling at the moment).  Blogger needs to add spellcheck for those of use who go blank when writing and have some really fucked up words and sentences.  It is taking me forever to type this because I keep on wanting to type different words like song instead of words.  I think I may still have a buxx...I mean buzz.  See I'm no good today.   A piece of work...   I want a new tattoo.  Six is just not enough.  I want my scareb beetle on my lower neck.  It will be beautiful and oh so me.  Okay dancing is not an option...I took a break to dance and now I'm dizzy.  But I really do want another tattoo.  I really like the armband that Dwayne has.  I haven't see anything like it before.  Can I bite it?  Ha...ha..ha!  No seriously...I wouldn't mind having that go around my leg...that sounds really double meaningish.  But I would have it colored in with red and black.  Oh the possibilities....cheese!  For some reason I am in the mood to write a lot today.  It's not going to be another strung out and type all day thing.  I'm getting ready to go to the store with April.  I need to brush my teeth and put on some deodorant.  So I better get my ass moving and get to steppin!    Thanks again Amanda and Tricia!!

       Anyone out there?   Hmm.  I'm almost at a loss for words right now.  Thinking can be one of the most dangerous things that we as humans do.  I've come to the conclusion that I will never find anyone.  It's pretty depressing when you think about it.  But for the most part I'm happy being with myself.  I mean I don't get into arguments or have to serve anyone but myself.  So those are pluses.  But there also come a lot of negatives.  Friends just aren't filling the void anymore.  Not that I have the most friends in the world.  But I love the ones I do have.  I really want someone...is there anyone out there?  That is what I have been thinking about over the past couple of weeks.  Anyone pretty much specifies anyone.  I'm not partial to dragqueens or midgets or any oddity of a person.  You can't choose who you want to love or choose to live with.  I have seen several friends go through this.  They are happier now than they have ever been.  Sex really doesn't mean much to me anyway...it's too sweaty(hmm...weight loss).  Me...I find many people attractive and some more than others I find myself more than attracted to.  This isn't a coming out of the closet moment it's just a thought.  Yes I have been with someone of the same sex before but it amounted to nothing and I actually felt like the world was going to cave in because it was wrong.  But that relationship was purely sexual.  I've been with one person who was male.  But, I was really young and immature as well as the other person.  Experimentation can be a bitch.  It lasted for several months.  However, I have been with several ladies...but I haven't went the distance.  Let's just say that the other things people mention are quite fun especially with women.  Hang me on the cross if you must but it's part of who I was.  I cannot predict the future.  For those of you that read this you may find this alarming but oh well it's really no one's business except my own.  Only several people know this about me and I really don't think the parentals need to know more than I've shared.  I wouldn't be alive if my father found out about the first relationship.  My mother knows some things but I choose not to hurt her more than I already have.  I have always found myself attracted to anyone.  I guess it's my flaw...I don't know.  I think that all people are beautiful in some aspect.  Whether it be their eyes, hair, teeth or personality there is always something that is attractive about a person.  Now I'm not saying that all people are gorgeous because I have meant some dogs if you know what I'm saying.  More importantly, I think I am hopelessly attracted to someone that I've not said before.  It has gotten to the point that I wake up thinking of this person.  I don't know if any of it could amount to a pile of beans but oh well.  Maybe I'm just being silly but I don't think so.  But damn did I meet one sexy bastard last night.  Hmm...you're probably wondering.  It's not a sexual attraction I just want to bite him.  I have this thing with skin and biting.  Didn't know I was such the freak did ya?  Amanda totally understands it.  It's not like I want to jump this person's bones I just wouldn't mind a random kiss.  Dwayne you bad bad man why do you have to be so attractive.  Oh and if you think I'm all Queer as Folk it's not that...because the person I want to be with is female.  God my life is too confusing.  But I think I'll be happier one day...hopefully sooner than later.  Why couldn't shit just have worked out with Summer.  I could have babies and everything now.  Sometimes I think that I've had a horrible trick played on me.  Summer...damnit.  Why do I always think about her?  I know the first love thing and what not but it gets to be annoying that I compare everyone to her.  She was placed on my throne and not many people live up to her.  My heart sometimes bleeds for her.  It's like a dream that I can't wake up from.  Thinking of her almost everyday drives me crazy and I try to block it out.  I guess pain has a longer staying power than I thought it could.  Anyway,  I'm bored and tired of writing my life story so I'm going to find something else to do before I go crazy.  And please keep this entry to yourself that's all I ask.  Paul

       Would you like a beer with that?   No...I feel like complete and udder horseshit this morning/afternoon.  Last night April and I went to her friend Frank and Dwayne's house.  It was too much fun.  Especially when Frank had boxers and a lampshade on dancing to Erotica by Madonna.  Then he winds up spanking his boyfriends ass with a mini blind adjuster stick.  April got a whipping on the arm.  Who would ever think that a lampshade could become a tophat?  Not I, I'll have to admit that.  I really didn't think I had a buzz or anything until I got home.  Then the alcohol kicked in overtime mode.  I started of with three 23 oz. Mike's Hard Lemonade and then had like 6-7 Bud lights.  I really was sober until I got home.  Then I thought I could fly while laying in the bed.  Don't ask me what I was thinking...but I fell out of the bed.  I didn't go to bed until 4 am this morning and then woke up at 5:44am and had the worst headache...took two sleeping pills and crashed.  Now I'm awake but still tired...that's where the horseshit blues comes in.   Revenge of the Golden Girls   Just when I thought the Golden Girls was losing steam on Lifetime...I find out that Frank and Dwayne love the Golden Girls.  My woman are taking over.  Though the show may be cancelled and only reruns are on they are going to find you GG haters and bind you with polygrip!   Eye shattering experience   So I find the makeup that I used last Halloween when I dressed up as Ms. West Virginia...and get a ding/lightbulb above my head.  I was bored and thought "Hey put some makeup on one of your eyes and then take it off to have something to do."  Doesn't sound too dangerous does it?  Well it was.  Here I have my right eye all dragarific with pretty shades of silver and gray and black.  Well I'm like "Well now that you've gotten in touch with your inner diva it's time to take the makeup off because it is annoying to feel it on your skin."  So I use water at first and it won't come off...then I move to soap and water.  It starts coming off.  Well I accidently rub a little too hard and get anitbacterial handsoap in my eye (I wear contacts) and then get washcloth burns under my eye.  I have a huge red cut under my eye.  See...makeup is dangerous.   The most important part of last night...   So Frank has these brilliant names that he loves to give people...April and I have new secret agent identities.  April is now:  Moonpie Ziggowitz with the special power of the lawn mower.  She can kill with the blades and attract all Mexicans within the tristate to her beck and call.  Paul, me is now:  Cornbread Jones with the special power of the "couch left on the front porch" and my weapon is day old muffins that I carry in a basket and throw at people.  My ring is an octagon and is dark blue.  They can't leave Bubbles Malone's (Frank's) house because of the sacred WV power stone.  Frank is:  Bubbles Malone with the special power of everything.  Dwayne is:  Chunky Beaver or Quiffa Jism and his power was never disclosed.  But Frank changed his name thoughout the night and this one stuck for the moment.  You see meeting new people let's everyone get in touch with their inner WonderWoman...  All the world is waiting for you...and the power you possess...  Paul

       I am the exception to your everything...   Is that a t-shirt logo or what?  I really need to break into the t-shirt logo industry.  I mean it.    Just got finished downloading some music...did I pay for it...I think not.  And then went on to read some blogs of people I would obviously find boring.  I understand that having a vast vocabulary is a good trait but damn these people are to me...modern day Shakespeareans.  It makes me wonder if they have ever heard of slang terminology.  Ugh!  People frustrate me beyond belief.     Just when you thought Joan Crawford was dead...dun...dun...dun   It's been forever since I've mentioned her highness.  Well when I was in Baltimore I got to way Queer Eye For The Straight Guy for the first time...and now I'm in love with it.  I love it for the simple fact that the guy they made over used wire hangers.  For anyone who doesn't know this...that is bad karma for your couture.  Well the really really Queer Eyed Guy says "Do you know what wire hangers do to your clothes?  And who will come after you?  J.C. and I don't mean Jesus Christ...Joan Crawford."  I thought I was going to lose it.  See I told you that wire hangers invoke Joan Crawford.

       Long time no write...   Just got in from the big B-More.  I had a really good time.  Listening to a seventy year old woman (my grandmother) say the same stories over and over has become quite fascinating because I look for the changes each time I hear it.  I think she has a really good memory because none of the wording changed.  However, I heard more stories than I care to share about my Aunt Cathy not coming to pick my grandfather up to go to the hospital and my grandmother having to tear the stormdoor down.  Her actions of taking the stormdoor into her own hands was quite "Sheera" inspired if you ask me.  But none the less I listened on and on and on and on.  However,  I don't mind listening to her talk and repeat herself...it is just that when she stands in front of the television and blocks the picture and closed captioning that I get a little irritated.  You see I watch and read the television so I can also hear her talk.  Think of it as multitasking.  Move it Granny...I didn't know I was tuning into saggy ass tv tonight?   What a small world...   So I took my Granny to the bank for her to get money and things situated and I was sitting there with no air conditioning so I had the windows down.  Well this woman with bootie shorts and blond hair comes over to me and is like do you have a light?  And a cigarette?  I was like no.  Well she proceeds to sit down next to the truck and starts talking about how she is from Martinsburg, WV and blah blah blah.  Oh did I mention she was just released for prostitution?  Huh...must have slipped my fucking mind...this is the second hooker that has tried to pick me up and turn a trick.  I got to see some really ugly hooker get picked up by some big fat bastard and they drove off into the sunset...I really wanted to follow them and be like...this is a stick up...oh I see you've already taken care of that...ha...ha!  Anywho, the WV hooker is all like "So what's your name?  What are you doing here?  Where's your grandmother and how long will she be?  Oh and by the way are you a cop?"  Hello...do I look like a cop?  No..and don't you think you should have asked that before trying to get with me...ewww hooker pussy...how nasty...ugh!  The only pussy that has been getting thrown my way is Curtis Bay Poon (it's this part of Baltimore that smells like fifty day old used tampon...it's gross).  And at that I'd have to pay for it or give her a ride back to Martinsburg.  What a small ass world!   The Granny Translations   So my Granny is notorious for mispronouncing words and here are a couple that I heard on my visit:  1.  Hankchakiff...or more popularly known as hankerchief.  Used in a sentence..."Your grandfather is not supposed to use tissues he has to use white hankchakiffs (hank...cha...kiff)."  2.  Teajus...or what would be pronounced tedious.  Used in a sentence..."Wrapping the porcelain to be boxed is a teajus (te..jus) job."  3.  Reppickle...or in webster's as replica.  Used in a sentence..."My Princess Diana plates are the real thing they are not reppickles (rep...pickles)."  When I think of somemore I'll be sure to inform you all.  Remember to use these words from now on...oh and the sentences above are the ones that were spoken by Granny...Lord help her.  Laytizzle my bizzle on the skizzle repizzle...  Paul

       Baltimore ho...   When I get motivated I'm going to leave to go to my grandparents house for the weekend.  My grandmother needs help taking care of my grandfather...and I'm totally feelin some pains in my stomach today so I won't be heading for work.  Not that it really matters...I mean I'm only going to be there until next Friday anyway.  I know that this weekend isn't going to be one big shopping spree...it will be more like an episode of the Golden Girls at Shadypines Retirement Home.  But duty calls and I really don't mind.   What I'll be up to...   I'll be working still in Frederick for an insurance company.  I get to call their clients to check on claims and make sure that people aren't double dipping when making claims.  You know put a claim in to your insurance company and then your spouse's for the same reason.  It starts off at around $26,000 a year which is $7000 more than Alphabet Group and $4000 more than CGroup.     I'm gettin good motherfucka'...   Ha...ha...ha!  That's right I said it.  No need to applaud.  I finally learneded how to put pictures on my website/blog.  Can you be-weave it?  I've worked my ass off...and look you have quizzes now.  How "interaction" mode of me.  I know that they are borrowed from another site but hey you can look at pretty pictures and take weird quizzes now.  I want to buy my own website.  It will be for Angel and I.  Remember floaches...well when I get the money it will be up and running...www.floaches.com!  I haven't taken the name yet but I'm gonna...I mean it.  And I also need F.S.F.P. as a website too.  Maybe I'll combine the two and a corporation will be made.  It will be me as President of both and April as Vice-President of F.S.F.P. and Angel as Vice-President of Floaches.  Possible motto's for www.floaches.com:  1.  Together we can make a difference!  Floaches of the world unite! 2.  Help starving floaches across the world...their hungry! 3.  Help support the United Friend of the Floach Foundation...UFFF!  Possible motto's for Fuck Skinny Fat Is Pretty.com:  1.  Together we can make the world a more flabulous place.  Fat People Unite! 2.  We're in...we're out...eatin' food is what we're about! 3.  Make a fist and smack a skinny bitch...she's crazy...she ain't cold she's starvin'!  Making skinny people plumper!  Well ya'll have a great weekend...and I'll write on Monday evening!  Farizzle my nizzle on the Wee kitty kizzle!  Paul

       Screwed...   Just like a virgin on prom night.  I'm leaving my current job that I just got for a better opportunity making four thousand more dollars a year.  Woohoo!  Yay me!  CGroup or whatever you want to call it is a crock of shit.  I'd have better luck back at my old job.  I barely work...I pretty much talk on my cellphone all day and then read for a while and then go to my breaks.  It's a gravy job that at first I thought was cool but I need a challenge.  Wish me luck.    And Constance if you read this webpage I gave you a good reference!  Email me sometime hoochie!  Later people!  Paul..."In search of the perfect job" Boy

       Come on baby...gimme gravy   Gimme gimme gimme gimme gravy tonight.  Well that is what my job is.  It is a gravy job making more money than I was before.  And guess what I don't have to be on the phone for 7 1/2 hours daily.  I like the people that I work with although something tells me that they don't have a wild side like me.  There is a lady that lives like 15 mins away from me working with me and a lady from India and a lady from Tennessee.  She is the southern bell...has the voice and everything.  The best part about working at CGroup is that Joyce "Crackwhorethewiltedflower" Wilt works with me.  We have laughed soo much since I've been there and it's only been for two whole days.  Top five reasons why I hated Alphabet Group:  1.  Too many politics 2.  The I can do it but you can't system 3.  Backstabbing 4.  Mandatory OT 5.  Bitchy supervisors  What I miss:  Susan, Angel, Samantha, Tricia, Ellen, Jocelyn, Terese, Sharon, Susie, Josetta, Amanda, Desi, Aimee, Joanne, Barb, Janetta, Robin, Chrissy, Alicia, Melody.  There may be some people I've forgotten but I doubt it.  As for missing my supervisors...nah.  Toodle fanoodle,  Paul

       How much does it possibly take...   How much does it possibly take? What would the intentions possibly make?  Is there a light at the end of the tunnel? Does your body leave you as if caught in a funnel?  Does it really matter of all the good and bad? Is this a joke, have we really been had?  Would memory be lost of all the time left spent? Sometimes do you wonder if there is a need to repent?  Could one person be the key to all that is call life? Anger, pain, and battle why all the strife?  The answer is to give it a chance and the  possibility  For if you don't there may be the loss of one's tranquility.  To question is fair and by far not a sin Life is like mixing apples and oranges in a bin.  Be thankful for what knowledge you possess And doubts will come to you less and less.  A little sum-sumin' to think about.  Peace  Paul

       I've cracked the code   At work anyway.  I am secretly plotting to take over the company with my work ethics.  They are great...please stop laughing...it's not that funny.  I have devised a plan on how to not work at work.  It is great and doesn't involve fainting.  "It's the precious" as Gollum would say and I'm keeping it all too myself.  In response to April's letter on  urlLink SM&C Blog  I want the person who was selling the house to fucking lick my ass...damnit...spoil my decorating bubble.    And now I've decided that Evanescence is my favorite group.  I made Cheryl listen to the first song for 3 hrs straight today.  When I finally changed it she said thank God.  But I was like oh no you didn't.  And the evil in me put it back on for another spin.  Yah....ha...ha....the evil ensues!

       Are you buggin?   I am.  I was at Hair Cuttery tonight looking at products while I waited to get my hair cut.  So I go to pick this gunk up and a jumping spider is on it.  Hello!  Bugs, fish, creepy crawlies don't belong in a hair cutting place...unless they are getting their hair did.  No...not at all.  I think bugs track me down and try to give me a heart attack.  I almost killed a child in the process of jumping back away from it before it jumped on the next bottle.  Damn aracnids.  But on a more interesting note...  This morning when I stopped to get a soda I almost ran over a woman.  I thought it was funny...she didn't.  But then again she did just get off work.  Today's hair tip:  Put on a visor.  Then clip a curly ponytail on each side.  Go to a co-worker who has their back to you and ask them "How much do you love me?"  "Well if you love me that much turn around."  (and be in some sexy position)    It's called the Princess Layah Love Look.  That's what I did to Esther today.  Now she loves me even more.  Before I got my hair cut today I made it into a mohawk and then put it in three mini-tails.  They were cute.  Esther said I should wear my hair like that all the time.  I just don't think everyone would appreciate it...I mean Jennifer did tell me that I could pass for a tri-unicorn.  Yah..ha...ha!  Question of the day:  And just why can't the grass be greener on the other side?  I say it's covered in cow shit but who am I to know.  I CAN'T WAIT TO MOVE OUT AND DECORATE!  Later painter...

       Oh my...   I thought that if I took a 2 muscle relaxers I would feel better.  Now I can barely function.  My eyes keep crossing and it's getting harder to type.  What the fuck?  I'll probably be passed out in like 30 more minutes.  And I have a movie to watch damnit!  So much for that.  But pray that tonight's dreams are filled with scenes concerning me, Kate, and Scott...and the things that happen in the UNDERWORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I told you I'm fucking crazy for this movie.  I might go see it tomorrow after work. Or leave work 20 mins early to catch it.  But anyway...I'm thirsty and in need of some refreshments.  Have a good night ya'll.........

       On the record...   Underworld fucking ROCKS MY FUCKING WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman can devour me at anytime.  They are the most fucking hot vampire/werewolf couple I have ever seen in my life.  Again I am reassured that biting is a good thing.  I am so hot and bothered I need to take a shower!  I must see this movie again tonight.

       Don't bother me when I'm talking to myself.   For the love of sesame seed chicken...why do I constantly have to think?  I get in these weird situations where I have to think about everything when I try to go to bed.  For instance, two weeks ago I was trying to think of Darryl Hannah's name in Steel Magnolias and it kept me up until 3am.  Tossing and turning and constantly coming back to the same question.  It's driving me crazy.  Last night I kept thinking...gee I wonder how awesome April and I's house it going to be decorated?  And I kept on thinking of all the possibilities for decorating the living room (oriental, african, greek).  And I tossed and turned all night thinking about it.  I think I'm just a genius undercover.  One day I'll toss and turn and come up with the cure for AIDS or world hunger or a better answer than "World Peace" for the Miss America Pageant.    Until then, I'm going to see Underworld today and go shopping in my new hometown of Frederick.  I'm there so much it feels like that's where I actually live now.  But soon April and I will live in our own place.  What we have decided on so far is: no smoking in the house, a condom and chocolates basket be kept on the table, new carpet, no fornication on the couch or public property, and that Granny and other older relatives are allowed to break the smoking rule.  So far so good.

       What dreams may come   Was a really crazy movie.  But that's not what I'm here to talk about right now.  Last night I had the craziest dream over and over again.  So this dog is in this front yard.  And it looks all scared and stuff.  I'm in Baltimore by the way walking around my grandmother's neighborhood.  So I go to pet the dog and realize that the front door to the house is open.  So I go in and find the owner dead.  So instead of being rational and calling 911 I take the dog home and adopt it as a pet.  I leave the body to rot.  But the best part about the dream is that I adopted a PURPLE POODLE.  She was so cute.  She wasn't a miniature or big poodle she was right in between.  And we had the bestest time ever in the dream.  She was like the perfect pet.  I don't remember having to really take care of her.  We just went shopping, to work, and chilled.  Now that I think of it it almost sounds like a version of Legally Blonde.  But anyway I'm convinced this is a sign that I need a poodle.  So I have to bribe my parents into letting me have a poodle...and I want to dye her purple.  Like a lavendar.  And her name will be Smurfette.  But then when you think the maddess ends...  I had another reoccurring dream.  This time it was April and I shopping (something tells me I have a serious addiction) at some shopping center or something.  We both decide to get into the back seat of the jeep and two men get in the front seat.  The one has a sawed off shot gun.  We are taken hostage.  I think this happened before we left the mall and that's why we got in the back seat first.  So anyway, we are driving and driving and no one realizes that we are taken hostage.  So these two criminals are talking to us and we are both like....yeah...no...excuse but we're hungry sir can we stop for some food.  Well in the mean time a helicopter just happens to fly overhead and I wave it down.  The criminals get ahold of what I'm doing and speed off...faster than the helicopter now mind you.  So then the criminals start asking April and I all kinds of questions about sex, drugs, and what kind of clothes that we bought.  April tells the two men that she is going to a ball and that she bought 3-4 ballgowns because she couldn't decide on which one she liked the best.  They stop at a rest area and tell April to give them the dresses.  So we are left in the jeep with the keys in the ignition while they are changing into dresses.  So when we see them disappear into the bathroom we haul ass away and go to Baltimore to see my grandmother for some odd reason.  We thought we should hide out in some place inconspicious incase they looked for us.  And then we set off fireworks that night at my grandmother's house in celebration of alluding two dragqueen kidnappers.  What the hell is wrong with me?  But then...  I have another dream with April and we go on vacation together.  My parents sent us to this palace for vacation.  It had a waterfall on the inside, marble floors, beautiful Venetian style walls.  It was like walking into a fantasy world (no pun intended).  But anyway, the whole dream April and I are constantly looking for each other because the hotel is so large.  And when we finally find each other it is like a month later.  We end up in our room that is all crushed red velvet.  And when I mean all crushed red velvet....ceiling, floor, walls, toilet, sink...the whole 9.  Anyway, April tells me this "I shall never be fat again."  And I realize that we are models on tour in France for some Versace or Gucci show.  And we looked hot.  And then the dream was over.

       And so on...   Today I was listening to the song "Sippin on some sizzer."  All is good.  Then Cheryl asks me:  "Why would you want to sip on siccors?"  My reply:  "For piercing purposes...bwah...ha...ha"  Her reply: "Oh my bad...it's sippin on some sizzler."  My reply:  "There is no hope for you my child."   Yesterday's lesson on how to piss your husband off by Kim   Real life situation:  Kim wakes up...gives her husband a blowjob...uses his toothbrush to brush her teeth.  Her husband...enjoys the blowjob...goes to brush his teeth...realizes after the fact it had already been used for the day.  Result:  A mad husband.  The stories that people share at work.  I don't think her husband should have been mad I mean he did get the good end of the deal.  Right? Now other wives are wanting to do this to their husbands.  I think there are going to be some angry men tomorrow.

       Today is a national holiday....celebrate   It's National Smelly Exhaust Pipe Day....party people and get your fucking exhaust fixed because they smell like shitcakes.  And on a more important note:  As I was driving over the bridge today I noticed that the river was really high.  And I wondered to myself as I often do:  "Paul do you think if you swan dive off of the bridge into the river that you would make a splash or die?"  I like to think of myself as glamourous and have a tiny splash.  However, reality has set in and I think I'd create a world of havoc with the tidal wave I would make and then die.    And I've come up with a new vaccuum.  The Hoover Havoc.  Slogan:  Don't fuck with the Hoover Havoc....it will suck you dry.   I think the censors would like that.  My ideas are amazing and since my first language is "fuckmerunningyoudicksuckingtwatlickingsonofabitchinwhoreslutrag," I think I'd get rave reviews.  Anyway, I'm in la la land.  You know what that means...  And if you don't I'm pretty sure you can figure it out if you read back through my journal.

       Here's the OM      So what do we think of the new foot tattoo?  I love it.  The pictures not that good but you get the point.    And the question for the day is:  Have you ever taken a shit and been like damn this is some foul shit?  P.S. Yes Tricia it's one of the hot guys.........Frank!

       Is it me or....   Is my new tattoo sexier than hell?  I think it's sexy and so do the women at work.  I promise I'll have a picture tonight.  I have to take it at work and send it to my email and upload it on the website.  It's one big project.  Plus I have to make sure that the picture looks good.  Duh?  Tricia:  Thank you so much for the email.  I truly appreciated it.  And what you had said is way true.  I just get in moods where I think a lot harder than I need too.  I'm not sure why but when I go there it's never good thinking.  It's always...waw me...waw me.  Cry me a damn river.  But I'm way over it.  Until the next time you see me write so crazy, suicidal, manic depressive shit.  Other than that just ignore it.  It's the thinker in me coming out.  No pun intended.  When are we having the sex toy party?  I've already started asking people if they would come. Again no pun intended.  Tink:  Thank you too for the comment.  It was so true just to live for the moment.  Like when I'm going to dance at work today to "Get Low" because I can.  And I sent you an email but it kept coming back from sbcglobal?  What's up with dat?    April:  This weekend...party all the time.  Didn't mean to cry last night.  At least you were able to get me in a better mood.  And I didn't go to sleep because I was upset I was actually experiencing technical difficulties with muscle spasms.  So when you called I was knocked out from some pain killers because I couldn't breathe with the muscle spasms coming back to back.  And call Frank and ask what he thinks of the Alphabet Poop.    Tricia...our friend Frank is now working at you know where...so you have to give him access to Alphabet Poop when I get him set up on our other site.  Love ya'll!  And does anyone know where the title of last night's entry came from?  What Band and what Song?  Winner get's free liquor...

       Plagued by fucking lunatics   I've come to realize that the world is full of lunatics.  People with double standards, hate, anger, cruelty.  I'm starting to hate life more and more everyday.  People say make the best of life.  But what's there to make of it?  Take it as a grain of salt.  That's easier said than done.  Sometimes I wonder what all this is for.  Is there really something like a big prize when you make it through life or is it just one big cruel joke?  Does anything even matter?  Does death, murder, hate, obsession, love, passion really amount to anything besides an emotional struggle?  It seems to me that the crueler someone is or the more shady a person is they get by better in life than those who choose to try to make life enjoyable.  Why?  Why is it that someone can rape, murder, be addicted to drugs and live a better life than someone who tries to live by some type of moral code?  My mind is becoming increasingly harder and harder to control.  It's almost like I'm not even me anymore.  I feel like there is a void where my inner self used to be.  Nothing seems to make me happy anymore.  It's almost as if life is over for me when people tell me that it has just begun.  The passion that I used to have for life is slowly evaporating.  Simple things that I used to enjoy like reading, movies, and music have become so stagnent.  It's like the same things are being repeated over and over again.  What used to be new and fresh has become obtrusive and stark.  Maybe I've lost touch with reality I don't know.  I'd like to think that this will go away but I know that it will come back; it always does.  Ever since I was a child I have lost myself inside myself.  Maybe I just don't know who I really am.  I've thought for a long time that I am just the image of everyone else around me.  I mimic people.  Without that I wouldn't be.    And to the person who is leaving the unappropriate comments....thanks.  It's people like you that make life agony for so many other people.  I think you need to look deep inside yourself and think of how you would feel if you were the one getting the nasty remarks.  Whatever I may have done to you I'm not sorry for because you won't tell me who you are.  So it's whatever.  The comments I can get over I just hope that you enjoy the site and fess up to who you are.

       Meditation is a good thing....   And so is getting the Om symbol tattooed on your left foot.  I love it.  I love it.  I love it.  My mother gave me $50.00 and said do with it what you will.  So I got another tattoo.  I'll have a picture posted later today.  And congrats to Dewayne...he is no longer a "comment virgin!"  Tell Frank to send me another email his is saying I can't send one to him due to fatal errors.  I'm trying to get him access to 3 fags.    But until then...I'm off to work!

       I need to be in...   A better fucking mood.  Woke up this morning and could not sleep.  I mean when you go to bed at 4am and wake up at 8am your not exactly Mary Fucking Sunshine.  Maybe that's the reason I'm in a bad mood.  Plus I just balanced my checkbook and paid bills and I'm left with $89 to the end of the week.  Which really isn't horrible but when I get paid on Friday I still have no money because then my car payment is due.  Fuck...fuck...fuck!!!!!!!!!!!!! to the infinite degree.  I want a tattoo so bad but I don't have the cash flow for it right now.  The only thing that could possibly make me happy right now is a tattoo for some reason because I found the OM symbol I want.  I wish my parents would loan me there credit card so I could get it.  It would only be like $50.00.  But until then, they are taking me to the movies to see UnderWorld.  Paxil is just not helping with my mood today.  I just want to yell and fucking hit someone.  On a lighter note:  I had mad fun with April and Frank last night.  We went to the Adult Bookstore in Martinsburg and then went back to Frank's place.  Frank made me feel good about myself saying that I am attractive and I shouldn't be so hard on myself.  Big ups to Frank.  When I actually have money I am buying him something.  Frank you lucky bastard!

       Sometimes when I think about myself....   I wish I had a cape to wear.  A red one with a big ol' P on the back of it.  I would be known as Super P or Chinless Hubb Boy.  Hmmm.  New idea to dress up as for work on Monday, except my super powers will not help the week go by faster.  But maybe I can make the sprinklers come on at work if I concentrate hard and long enough.  Or I can just take a lighter to them and bring Isabel back to the coast for a true party.    Ah the joys of being a bad bad boy.

       The purpose of the internet....   To suck you dry of all your energy.  And to make you think naughty thoughts about the guy from Smallville and how you would like him to be on the menu for breakfast.  Did I just write that?  I think I did.  I'll have Tom Welling from Smallville for breakfast and Katie Holmes from Dawson's Creek for lunch.  Isn't the a sensible meal?  I knew you would agree.  They are both hotter than me in a spandex dress.

       There's nothing better than....   A woman in her late 40's quoting:  "I never watched that little fuzzy motherfucker." in reference to Alf.  See the fine conversations I have with my co-workers.    Life has become more and more pleasing when you have a woman named Cheryl sitting next to you at work and cussing is her first language.  Why can't more people learn curse words before English.  It would make the world a better and more fucking tolerable place.    And Monday will be  urlLink Attack of the Pink Fairy Day .  After an extensive love fest with myself I have to wonder if there is a place in hell for "Habitual Masturbators."

       Tra...la...la...   Twidle de de.  Twidle de dum.  Your breath wreaks of cum.  Isn't that a cute quote?  I just made it up.  I think that will be tomorrow's motto.  I wonder if it is appropriate for the workplace?  Everything is going okay at work.  I'm a superstar.  I actually find this job quite amusing.  The people are hilarious.  But Cheryl was sick today so my cuby buddy wasn't there.  Damn sinus infections.  Just damn them to hell.   She will be back tomorrow however.  At least she better be.  I called like 130 people today.  Isn't that amazing.  And I only got ahold of 16.  So much for communication at the workplace.  Tricia....I want to test out a product...how about some chocolate body topping?  I'll eat it on my ice cream and watch porn at the same time so that way it's at least semi-erotic.  Whatta ya say?  Oh the joy of being frustrated.

       Just when everything was going okay...   It turned for the worse.  My back is killing me.  Not the I can deal with you hurting but the I need to kill myself right now before it gets any worse.  You know just when I think things are going okay I get kicked right in the ass.  What is up with that.  I think I may have pulled a disc in my upper back.  I don't know.  The only thing I know is that when I look down my back feels like it is about to fall off and sitting isn't comfortable at all.  Not even laying in the bed.  And to top it all off I have bengay stinging my arms where I tried to put it on my back.  Damn it.  I don't want to say anything to my mom about it yet because she is so happy that everything is going okay for once.  But guess what the was only momentary.  It was a piece of dust in time.  It is gone.  Tricia told me: "What's the point of living if you can't enjoy it." or something to that effect.  And I'm starting to really understand that quote more and more.  God I hope this ends soon.

       Taco Bell...ding..ding...ding...ding   Yesterday I got Taco Bell.  And it was better than everything at the moment but now I'm starting to re-evaluate the situation since my stomach is having "bathroom issues."  Cramps are not fun ladies.   How do you deal with it?  Someone get me some Midol or Pamprin.  Today I want Chinese food from Panda Express in Frederick.  But at this rate tums would be a feast.

       And on to more important news...   I really want Taco Bell and the sad thing is that I dreamt about eating a chicken quesdilla from there.  Could it be the alcohol, the mind, or the fat telling me to feed it?  I don't know yet.  All I know is that if I don't get Taco Bell sometime today I may explode like that Chicken lady on Kids in the Hall.  Ruffle my feathers baby.....and feed me a taco!  Paul

       Have you had your break today?   I'm craving McDonald's chicken nuggets right now?  Can someone please get me a ten piece and hand deliver it to me NOW?  It would be greatly appreciated...and you have to pay for it too....because I said so.  Work went good today.  It was a little boring but by the grace of the powers of greyskull it proved to be an interesting day.  I thought about cutting my fingernails for most of the day becasue they are soooooo long that they hit other keys when I type.  And I thought about what it would be like to be a hooker.  Would I be a nighttime hooker or daytime hooker?  I couldn't imagine turning a trick at 6am.  Really...the nerve of men trying to buy a hooker that early in the morning...it's not like you get an early bird discount.  Or do you?  I'll have to find out when I go back to Baltimore...there are plenty of hookers for me to interview there.    I think the lady that I was sitting with today caught herself in a ackward moment today.  Because we all know how everyone just assumes that I'm gay well she was like "I'm assuming that you don't have kids or a wife?"  "I'm assuming that you don't have a girlfriend?"  "I'm assuming that this can be a good thing."  And when I answered yes to all of the above.  Not that a significant other wouldn't be nice right now, she gave me this look like oh shit I think I want to ask him if he's gay but that would be ackward and inappropriate.  She already said she doesn't care for tattoos and I have 6.  Say la ve!  But for some reason I have to assume she is half retarded...I don't know why.  Plus she looks like Nicole Kidman and Australian's are just like that!  I'm just kidding...fucka!!!  Anyway,  I'm off to find a movie to watch tonight...later  Paul

       Am I a big crackwhore or what?   Why is it that people think I'm a big ol' druggie?  Huh?  Just because I have done some choice drugs doesn't make me a stoner...does it?  I haven't done drugs in forever.  It's been at least two years.  And the only reason that I smoked up was because of my back.  And I am all for medicinal pot because it helped me out many times before I had back surgery.  So today we were talking about allegra and Stacy asks me if I've ever gotten high off of that.  Hello...it's a nasal decongestant...not a take me to the moon and ride me like I'm your boytoy pill.  I've taken Allegra but not for the purposes of getting a buzz...I actually need to take medication for real purposes too.  So I've decided that I'm not the crackwhore the world has deemed me.  Maybe a crackslut or cracker but not to the extreme of a crackwhore...that is Joyce!   Sharon..........mwah...ha..ha..ha..haa   So I told Sharon what I wrote about her the other day and she lost it.  She is absolutely wonderful.  I think she might be better than buttered bread.  So we went on break together today and I told her that I thought it was going to rain.  She was all like no Paul it's not.  And I'm all like Sharon...I'm the weather lady I know.  But it has yet to rain.  Maybe if I were really a lady it would have rained.  Who knows.  I want to marry you Sharon...do you think your husband would mind?  Tell him that the baby is mine.  It will be okay...I promise...come on sugar muffin...be my valentine!   A little sumin' sumin' for my Momsi folk   So I have decided that the training at my current employment is great.  The people have really made the transition from Alaphabet Group to Momsi wonderful.  I just wanted to send a shout out to all my training buddies.  Heidi-(my trainer)  Girl is it me or do you want to play bad student with me?  Just joking.  I'll dress up in the catholic schoolgirl outfit if you want.  Ha...ha..  Anyway...Heidi you are an awesome trainer.  Thank you so much for making the trainer not so monotonous.  I love that we have gotten to know each other and that you make learning insurance interesting.  Even the lecture has been fun.  And this isn't a tempowary feeling...you make me feel sprecial...!  This is an inside joke.  So Heidi big props to you for being an awesome trainer.    Sharon-(my co-trainer...future wife)  This woman is so fucking funny.  I crack up just looking at her.  Especially when she appears to be half dead and half alive.  Oh and when she eats french apple pie I can't help but die laughing and then need to be brought back.  I really appreciate your sense of humor and the understanding of me.  I don't open up to many people but you make me feel comfortable enough that I can talk to you.  And thank you for not judging anything I've told you.  MWAH!  Jennifer-(my partner in crime)  You are too funny.  And I love the sarcastic moments in class.  Oh and you are really pretty too....incase your fiance never tells you that.  We are going to be great partners when we go to the floor.  You've really opened up and I think that we will have a great friendship....can I be a bridesmaid in the wedding or the flower whore...I mean girl?  Monique-(my ooolala girl)  You are beautiful.  And as for your boyfriend disrespecting you like he does...don't take it because you are way to funny and beautiful to be treated like that.  I like knowing that you feel comfortable asking me questions when you need help because that makes me feel like you think I know what I'm doing..when I probably don't.  We definitely have to go out together sometime for lunch or a movie.  Stacy(my girl w/o an e)  If ever there were a dark moment in class I'm sure that you could make us all smile.  The whales not having any teeth has to be one of the funniest questions I have ever heard.  And as for "can metal go into the microwave"  I too have put a fork in the microwave.  So we are both a little on the blonde side.  I mean look at the patch in the back of my head.  Congratulations on graduating!!!    So anyway I'm going to eat dinner.  And then go get gas in my car.  Until tomorrow...R EV WAH to my girls that are FLAH!

       Is it so wrong of me to want you?....in that way?   I have no idea why I entitled today's entry the above questions but I sort of like it.  I am the Wee--zil.  Remember that?  So last night April calls me and to my luck I had taken three benedryll a half hour earlier.  I am half dead.  What's the big deal you ask?  Well she wanted to go party over at Frank and Dwayne's.  Now you understand right?  You better.  Damn my evil crackwhore fairy Dragqueen.  What is wrong with her?  She did this to me...I didn't take those pills because of allergies or to go to sleep it was the pressure of my Fairy Dragqueen.  So needless to say I slept from 1030pm until 2pm today.  I woke up though at 5am and wondered if they were all still at Frank's house.  And at that moment I realized that I didn't go out on a Saturday night to see what Sharon at work quotes as "the hot guys."    Sharon is the best person that I have ever worked with.  She understands me.  Plus she doesn't have a problem with calling herself fat.    Quote of Friday:  "I am the big fat pregnant lady."  He..he..he!  We talked for a half hour non-stop and she is not so different than me.  And I mean that in a good way.  She has done most of what I have done and we have an understanding that everyone else wanted to know about but too bad they went to lunch elsewhere...we didn't.  So I can't wait to see her tomorrow to finish our conversation.   APRIL "MOONPIE ZIGGOWITZ" COCKSHELL   PLAN A  NEXT WEEKEND=A TRIP TO H2O DAMNIT! AND OUR MISSION IF WE CHOOSE TO EXCEPT IT AND WE BETTER IS:  GET FUCKED UP!!  PLAN B NEXT WEEKEND=A TRIP TO FRANK AND DWAYNE'S WITH MUCHO ALCOHOLO! AND OUR MISSION IF WE CHOOSE TO EXCEPT IT AND WE BETTER IS:  GET EVERYBODY FUCKED UP...ESPECIALLY FRANK!! (THIS IS MY VOTE...HAVING OTHER'S FUCKED UP IS SO MUCH BETTER...PLUS FRANK IS OUR ENTERTAINMENT)  For some reason I have this feeling that April is going to be away next weekend.  Damn it!  Then the weekend of the 19th...and I mean it.   I wanna dream tonight   No...not about your mom.  That was last night and the night before.  How about....ummm...you know...enough said!

       Why Tequilla is the best lay in town...   1.  Anyone can have it. 2.  It makes you forget that you were tired and makes you happy. 3.  It only involves money for the purpose of pleasing you.  And last...  4.  It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy when it goes down on you.     Alcohol inhibits the language barrier   Last night's tequilla intoxication word:  Me:  April why don't you buy Saramel Syrup? April:  Giggle...giggle...giggle...snort. Me:  I mean...uh..sa...uh...sara....um...caramel syrup.

       Giggle fest 2003   So it has been forever since I have had an extreme case of the giggles.  Well today Giggle fest 2003 began after lunch.  I could not stop thinking of the word "retarded."  Don't ask me why it was just stuck in my head.  I kept on placing it in unappropriate sentences, songs, phrases.  Like:  Correct sentence:  Oh I see that you have a dental policy through Aetna. Misuse:  Oh I see that you have a retard policy through Aetna.  Why I found it funny I have no clue.  All I know is that I kept making Heidi crack up and she told me that I needed to turn around so that she could teach because everytime she looked at me I would laugh and she would laugh.  It was just one of those days.  And speaking of days...have you ever been so tired that you thought you could fall asleep with your eyes open?  Well that was me today after my three stacker 2 caffeine pills wore off.  Starbucks Mocha Frappacino couldn't even help me recover.  Now I am even more tired than I was an hour ago.  I think I may be able to stay up until 8pm.  If not...goodnight ch'all.   Hoping that everything is okay...   So Dwayne and Frank got in a massive argument Sunday night and boy was it a big one.  They faught from their house to Walmart and shopping and coming home.  I hope that everything is okay.  April you need to do a follow-up just to make sure.  I really need to give them the bottle opener and the friendly sperm magnents.  Hopefully, that will give them a smile on their faces!  Lord what I wouldn't do for some Frank and Dwayne and April and Me time.  I need somemore humor in my life.  I want to see them sometime this weekend...and maybe we can take a ride to Variety Books!  We are a group of perv's!  Get over it!  Paul

       I'll have a serving of your mom with that...   Today was great at work except for the fact that I dosed off like 79 times.  It's not that the information is boring it's just that ever since April and I stayed out until 3am at Frank and Dwayne's I haven't recovered from the sleep I was missing that night.  So today at work I decide I want Starbucks.  Mmmm!  So I go on lunch and the coffeeman is all attentive and stuff and is like what can I get you?  I was like a mocha frappacino.  Well then he says:  "By the way what is your name?"  I tell him Paul and he winks and says "So how big do you want it?"  Could you be anymore obvious that you are flirting.  And to make matters even more weird he serves me my coffee on the palm of his hand and says "I really hope that this takes care of what you were looking for."  Oh my God!  However, the situation did make me feel even beautifuler than I know I am...just joking.  But now when I go to Starbuck's I may get free frappacinos.  Isn't life great when people think you are sexy?  Oh and I can't get my damn comments back...Tricia...help me!!  Email me!  Call me!  Hump me!  I don't care as long as I get them back!  So the next time I go to Starbucks I will have a serving of your mom with that!  Paul

       Forgive me Father for I have sinned   Tonight I think my mind is the most dangerous entity surrounding me.  Why is it that I become mute?  I am deaf to the world?  I am the void that only I know and I'm clouded by black?  How can I shut myself down and pray that I never resurface?  How do I let the part of me that terrifies everyone come to light?    I am so dark that sometimes I scare myself.  I like to hide.  I am the evil that is most dangerous.  I am human.  I am invisible.  I am the unforgiven.  "Fear not those around you.  For fearing oneself is the truth."

       Man I just mess up everything   I've done as you have asked.  And by you I know this person will know who the "you" is.  I just want to say that I didn't mean anything by the comments that I made on the website.  If anything it was stupid of me and I want you to know that I would never ever do anything in that respect.  I really do value our friendship.  You are the first male friend that I have had in forever who has accepted me for who I am and not wanted to change me.  I couldn't believe that you were able to read the comments especially since I erased them a long time ago.  April knows that I erased them so I'm guessing that the page was saved to your computer.  I really can't tell you how sorry I am for hurting you this way.  Please know that I would never act upon what I had mentioned in the blog that day.  It was just me expressing myself which I should have kept to myself.  I never expected you to read it or for the other person to read it.  I deserve whatever you have to say to me I know this I just hope that we can still be friends because I really really do enjoy having you as a friend.  I cannot stress enough how much of an idiot bastard I was for writing that about him.  It wasn't right to say that about him and I honestly didn't think it would upset you that much.  From the bottom of my heart I am truly sorry and if there is anything that I can do please don't hesitate to let me know you have my cell number.  I cried all day long when I thought of losing your friendship because of how stupid I let myself be.  I would never act upon what I said and I can't stress this enough either...please believe me when I say this.  You have done so much for my self-esteem and overall happiness that I can't believe I was so stupid.  I love you like a brother and that is really no lie.  I talk about you all the time because I enjoy you that much.  I even think about you and how you are doing and what I can do like when I stopped by to tell you about the Brittany video to better our friendship.  Ugh.  Umm...so just please know that I fully understand you being mad right now because you have every right to be but when I did write that I really didn't know you two all that well and I would take it back in a split second.  I have really moved on from that it was more like a I have to write about it to get it out of my system.  And please don't think that I come by to see the other person because I come by to see you.  You are one of the greatest people I have ever met in my life...seriously.  Actually, I don't even think about stopping to see that person because I tell April all the time when can we go see "you" I need so see "you." So if you read this please let me know that there is some type of hope that we can mend things and if there is anything I can do to make this up to you please please let me know because I am truly truly crazed right now at losing your friendship.  I want you to know that I love ya even if you decide we cannot be friends any longer and I'll always be around if you ever need me and I say this with the very core of my heart.  I am so sorry.

       Blonde moment for the day...   So rehab was kick ass.  The doctor is insane.  He cursed and everything.  He was like you have a fucking lot of prescriptions.  This is a shit load.  So here is the blonde moment for the day.  I was laying on the table and the doctor says "Do you like Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper?" I was like "No thank you I'm fine."  Little did I know this was just a question to see how much soda I drink.  The doctor replies with "I'm not asking you if you want any I just want to know if you drink soda...and I'm not giving you any...he..he..he."  I felt like such an idiot.  I'm on the phone with Constance ard Sarah right now.  I'm so happy to hear from them.  I miss them sooooo much!  I'm going up to Michigan to see them in January.  My parents are going to buy me a plane ticket to go up there for Christmas.  I told them I want a ticket, a bottle of absinthe, and a tattoo.  That's not too much.  So I'm going to go because I have lots of catching up to do.

       Long time....no write...   Been pretty busy at work.  It's going good except for me having to leave early on Friday because of my back.  But whatevah!  Nothing has really been going on in the neighborhood.  At least nothing entertaining.  Didn't do much of anything last night except for watch the 3rd DVD of Will and Grace.  I finished up the 4th DVD and managed to watch Charlie's Angels Full Throttle today.  Other than that I have been one lazy bastard.  YaY! go me!  I think I'm going to take a bath and maybe watch the whole W & G first season again.  It amuses me.  I was supposed to get a tattoo today but April couldn't go and I really don't need another one.  I mean I think that 9 is enough for the time being plus to get two in less than a month's time is ridiculous.  Yes keep telling yourself that Paul so not getting the tattoo today seems okay!  Later  And my shoes do not resemble fucking bowling shoes...they are the latest in fashion!!!!!  Damn it...I knew all along they would be called bowling shoes...it's a good thing I didn't get them in any other color but I love them and they love me.

       The Battle Has Begun   Today at work I wore my new shoes:  Look below        So Kim K. tells me that they look like old man slip on bowling shoes.  I'm like no they don't well then she gets Cheryl and Shelby thinking about it and they just bust out laughing.  Then my supervisor Kim B. comes over and is like they are cute for bowling shoes at least your bowling shirt matches them.  The battle has begun.  They made fun of my shoes all day.  And to make it worse while I was on lunch they cut out bowling pins and hung they throughout my cubicle.  Damn them...damn them all!  I think they are cute?  Don't you?  Tell me your honest opinion.  I had to stop on the side of the highway to take the pictures because I had to have them.  Yes my phone has a camera for those of you who don't know and the internet.  I'm a total net freak.  I have more to write about today but I want to eat and take a bath and watch Moulin Rouge!  Bye ya'll from my new alter ego.... G'Storm (it's a strippers name that April came up with by combining Geo and Storm together...isn't this a great name for me?)

       Yee-Haw   I need a video camera.  Why?  Because I want to submit a tape to "The Real World."  I think I would make a super cast member.  Seriously.  Imagine a Baltimore/West Virginia guy making it onto "The Real World."  Yee-Haw Bitch!  And last night I had one of the best dreams I have ever had in my life.  I wish that I could revisit it.  I woke up and was like no please don't tell me I'm awake.  Please.  So I tried to go back to sleep right away but couldn't get the dream to come back.  Damn the fucking sun!  And has anyone ever noticed how sexy Melissa from the New Orleans Real World is?  And has anyone ever noticed how sexy Danny from the New Orleans Real World is?  What a sandwich that would make.  Melissa is way hot, damn hot!  And Danny is Apollo-nistic to me.  God the troubles with being sexually frustrated.  Even the people at the dirty bookstore get more action than I do what the fuck?

       Yippy Skippy   Fuck.  Fuck you.  Fuck me.  Fuck for fuck's sake.  Everything is so not yippy skipy as you can tell by the poem or whatever above.  I had a pretty good day today.  I got a new pair of shoes, a furry green visor of Oscar the Grouch, and to top it all off a shirt that says "Don't Annoy The Unmedicated Person."  That so fits me.  I'm going to by a cape made out of black velvet this Friday from HotTopic.  It's only $50.00.  Good investment right?  I thought so.  Well the shirt is so fitting me right now.  I hate withdrawls...they suck big ass.  I was okay all morning and afternoon.  But tonight I'm like fuck where can I score some pills?  But I know that it will pass.  Hopefully.  Hmm I want to make a list of all the drugs that I have done...here we go:  1.  Pot 2.  Ecstacy 3.  Acid 4.  Xanax 5.  Valium 6.  Percocet 7.  Darvocet 8.  Ocycontin 10mg, 20mg, 40mg, 80mg 9.  Wellbuterin 10. Soma 11. Vicodin 12. Lithium 13. Librium 14. Loratab 15. Ultram 16. Adavan 17. Liquid Hydrocodone 18. Tylenol 3 19. Kadian 20. Neurotonin 21. Hash 22. Opium 23. Loracet 24. Roxacet 25. Flexaril 26. Moriphine  That's all I can thing of for now.  I'm sure there is more.  That's a pretty long list though.  But what I really want now is "The Green Fairy" or Absinthe.  But it has to be purchased from Russia or other places in Europe.  Don't worry it's a liquor.  No drugs all though it does have a small amount of hallcinigetic something or other in it.  I want it for Christmas.  Ever since I saw it in Moulin Rouge I've wanted to try it.  It's totally legal...in Europe but I still want to try just a shot of it.  I really hate detox/withdrawl.  But it's for the better.  I wonder how long you have cravings?  Probably your whole life, knowing my luck any way.  But moving on.  Here is a picture of the word "trademark" that was stitched into April's mom's hoodie:     Notice the "E" is not there.  I just love Tradmarks.  It was made in Vietnam but I'm not going to blame them for misspelling it I'll blame it on the designer.  Any way it's late and I want to go watch a movie and crash for the night.  I can't wait to get my cape on Friday.  I will look super-de-duper!

       Back what?   Today I was going through claims and I found this name...it is a child Philip Backover.  Get it...Flip Backover!  Yah..ha..ha!  The day was pretty uneventful until I discovered after 23 years and 4 months how to make paperdolls.  The kind that link together.  Well I just went crazy.  I made children first then moved on to women, men, gangsta's and angels and then pregnant women.  Well it didn't stop there I colored them in and passed them to people.  Then I thought hey you could connect anything together Paul.  So I made a pair of earrings and a tiara that had ruby's and emeralds on the top and the words "Burger King" written across it.  Oh what fun paper has made for my day.  I can't believe that it has taken me this long to figure out the solution to paperdolls.  I plan on getting construction paper this weekend and having a paperdoll fest so I can have paperdolls on my Christmas tree this year.  Yay!  Oh and I made eyelashes out of post-its.  They were really pretty.  I secured them with tape.    Today when I went to visit with Heidi she told me that I should be a drag queen.  Heidi:  You know you should really be a dragqueen. Paul:  For what?  For life? Heidi:  It's not like a lifetime achievement award dumbass.  It's a career.  You could be Liza or Cher. Paul:  Imagine me getting the life time achievement award for dragqueenism. Heidi:  For life?  For what?  She lost it for some reason when I asked the question "For life?"  Don't know why.  But then someone told Sharon because we were on the topic of christening children that usually mountain people and country people have their children baptized or whatever it is.  So Sharon was called a cave woman for growing up in the mountains.  She proceed to lug her pregnant body around as an ape and speak in broken twang.  Could life get any better than seeing a pregnant woman walk like an ape?    And today I also did the running man in my cubicle and down through the isle so Esther would be amused.  All in all I would say today was boring for what usually happens.  But it's not everyday that you are told you would make an excellent dragqueen.

       It comes in 3's   Today I learned that April's grandfather passed away at about 1pm.  I got the call from her at work.  I hope that her and her family will be okay.  Especially, her grandmother.  But, I know that he is in a better place as is Bob.  I told everyone at work today stories about Bob and they throughly enjoyed them.  Sharon and Heidi want me to tell more stories about Bob because they say he seemed like unique individual.  Which of course he is.  I mean was.  God that's hard to comprehend...writing about someone you know in the past tense.  But everyone asked about April's grandfather and when I told them that he passed they said "it comes in 3's" which I had already realized when I got the call from April.  My father said not to be so superstitious but i really think that it comes in 3's.  It has before.  When Barb's son passed away it wasn't a month when Robbie and two other people I knew passed away.  I just hope that Zac isn't freaked out by the email I sent to him...if he is I hope he at least let's me know.  But I think he will be okay and hopefully we will be able to develop a better friendship.  Bob had just joked that Zac and I had to be joined at the hip because we both like black women.  Anyway...  On to a brighter note...  Please pray that you never get Paradactyly (don't quote me on the spelling).  It is when a person has 5 or more fingers or toes on each hand or foot.  Imagine the possibilities of having 12-14 fingers.  And better yet 12-14 toes...you could hang from trees or power lines.  Oh the possibilites are endless for those with extra fingers and toes.  You are probably counting your fingers and toes like I did after learning about this disorder.  I wonder if you can get that disorder when it comes to downstairs...having two or more dicks or vaginas in one crotch area?  Now that could be fun....  I am way to perverted.  My journal will never be published.  I shall never be famous.  Or thin...I'm ready to eat dinner!  Yummy...yummy...in my tummy...

       Now it's starting to fall into place   The thing that I was talking about that is hidden.  Well guess what?  It was talked about today and where I know it's at the person came out of the blue and said it too.  My father just about dropped dead and so did the other person because of me mentioning it last night on the ride home.  This is exactly why I don't deal with death...because something weird always happens.  It all started with me quoting stuff to Susan that her mother used to say to her before she died.  Ever since then I just have these weird thoughts and questions and messages.  I feel like that guy that was on t.v. but I get really freaked out about it.  Well I'm off to finish "Tale of the Body Thief."  But first I must email Zac.  I know what the "he wanted you to know" is and I'm trying to figure out how to say it with seeming all crazy.

       You drunken crow...   This picture was taken at SuperFresh in Brunswick, MD.  It reminds me of my friend Joyce when she decided that pulling over and passing out in a corn field was a good idea.     And I've decided that my contacts and glasses are a piece of shit.  I think I could see better with glass eyes.  Plus I could coordinate them with my outfits.  Oh the woah's that life brings.  And for those of you who haven't met or talked to my Aunt Velma...I've decided that I'm her clone in a male form.  Conversation with her today.  Paul:  What are you doing? Velma:  I can't get this fucking mouse to work.  It's all eliptical and shit. Paul:  When is your paper due and does that mean it has a laser? Velma:  This fucking thing is a piece of shit.  I swear I'm going to put my fucking fist through the computer. Paul:  What's wrong with it? Velma:  It won't move.  I swear if you are going to buy a mouse buy a fucking decent one that works. Paul:  Are you sure the computer isn't frozen? Velma:  I don't know how do I fix it?  How do I turn the computer off? Paul:  With the off button.   Velma:  What the fuck ever.  I don't have a job yet.  I have to take Granny furniture shopping. Paul:  Hmm.  What time is your paper due again? Velma:  Sometime tonight.    And there's some boring stuff besides that.  It's like condensed into the best of the conversation.  See I'm her clone because not only does she use the word "fuck" as an adjective, adverb, noun, and pronoun but I've known that "fuck" would be my favorite and mosted used word forever.  And I'm guessing that it is still hers.  Plus we are both really vain and like to make fun of people.  But usually those people are beneath us.  Just joking.

       It's 6:54am what are you doing?   I wish that I was sleeping.  I am so tired that I know today at work I will not be productive, talkative, happy, and/or breathing.  To make matters worse I have to work a 1/2 hr over to make up for leaving yesterday at 4pm.  I really don't care about leaving yesterday because Kim said it was okay it's just the making up the tme part that is getting on my nerves.  I'm so tired that I'm wearing glasses for the second time to work.  That never happens...not even on my least glamarous day.  What the fuck man?  I need about 15 cups of coffee and about 10 more hrs. of sleep to go along with them.  Talk to you all later...if I have the energy to type this afternoon.  Somebody pass the jelly...  IT'S TOO FUCKING EARLY TO BE AWAKE DAMN IT ALL TO HELL AND BACK AND FORTH AND BACK AND FORTH.  UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       Just when I thought I wasn't crazy enough...   I have all these jumbled thoughts in my head.  About twenty minutes into the viewing tonight for Bob I heard someone say "he wanted you to know."  I have no clue where it came from considering I was outside by myself.  Then on the way home I had all these questions that just don't make sense yet.  There's this thing, I think it is dark burgandy with the initials JBL in gold on the front and it's hidden somewhere in a humador (cigar preserver) that is light oak quite possibly cedar lined not porcelain lined.  Where is this coming from?  I have no clue.  Maybe it will come to me...actually I know it will...like it always does.

       Mimi   So for Halloween everyone at work wants me to be Mimi from Drew Carey.  Of course I'm going to do it.  But I'm going to be the Miss America version of Mimi.  I've already started making the dress.  I have the perfect vinyl pink hat with feather trim.  And glittery purple glasses.  I'm going to tell people I'm Mimi...but in actuality I will be Pamela Boobsgiggle.  Because the hat reminds me of Pam Anderson's hat that she wore to the VMA's.  And my boobs do giggle in this dress I've started to make.  I will have a picture if I think I look hot enough.    But other than that I'm not in a very good mood.  Maybe it's the craving or whatever but I'm tired too.  God let the 27th get here so I can get some professional help.  I can tell by last night this is not going to be a good week.  I'm going to watch a movie and maybe fall asleep again...that's the only time I feel comfortable when I'm feening probably because I go all comatose.

       Questions   I often wonder why people can question God so much.  Is it because they are born to be damned or just because they need answers.  Tonight when I got home I found out the our closet family friend died of a heart attack at 54.  He would be 55 next week.  I looked at the autographed pictures of Lucy Ball and Desi Arnaz and I think why would God do this to such a kind person.  My father's closest friend?  Why?  Why do you just take life from people that make a positive effect on the world and leave all the evil people to live long and wonderful lives that most of use can't imagine.  Bob White was one of the kindest and most giving people I have ever met in my life.  He told me personally that he would do anything for me if I ever needed anything.  If you don't know him he had the Kennedy Collection auction at Christie's in New York about 5 yrs. ago.  I feel so bad for Zack his son and his wife Jackie.  I couldn't imagine.  When I look at the pictures that he gave me because he knew I love "I Love Lucy" so much I can't help but cry because I want to just die inside for him having to be alone.  He lost his mother not too long ago and now he has passed away.  If there is a purpose or test to this life I just don't understand it.  I'm not lashing out at God or saying that there is not a God I just am saying that shit needs to be carried out in a better manner when it comes to people dying.  Make the ones who kill, murder, rape, and are just evil die sooner.  Don't take away my father's closest friend and leave him to grieve like a child from which I'm sure he will never recover from this loss.  If what I'm saying is blasphamis than so be it because I really don't give a flying fuck.  All I know is that a person was lost tonight that was one of the people that I not only looked up to but thought of as an uncle.  He was wonderful.  Words can honestly not express how great of a person he was and how fascinating a person he was.  If God left him on this earth for the 54 yrs just so that I would be able to know him than so be it.  I just want to know why?  I know that  there is not an answer...that only God holds the true meaning for why he took Bob away.  But it still hurts inside to know that there are so many evil people in this world that live long lives and have everything at their fingertips.  I just hope that my father is able to cope with this and not die from losing what is his true "brother."  It's a miracle that God let them meet but to take them away from each other at such an early time.  I just want to scream.  Death is never easy for anyone to handle and I wish that it could be but it happens everyday and life moves on.  Such is life.  I just know that I need to straighten my life out not only for myself but for the purpose of trying to have an effect on the world in a positive way.    For those of you who never met Bob I want to let you know that I wish you had the opportunity to meet him and this is dedicated to him tonight.  I will miss you always Bob and I hope that you watch over my father because he has soooooooo much love for you that it is killing him right now to realize that he will never see you again for whatever reason.  Please Bob if you know what is occuring right now please make your presence in Heaven have a positive effect on the world because to me everything just seems to go wrong at the wrong time.  Zack and Jackie my heart goes out to you tonight.  I am there for you for anything even if it's just to dry your tears.  I love and will miss you always Bob.  It's good to know that I have you looking over me now.  I like to think that Aaliyah watches over me but now I know that I truly have an angel in Heaven.  Good night...and remember to love everyday and everyone that you hold close to your heart because in an instant they could be gone.  And good luck on the surgery Pappy (April's Grandfather) I hope to see you well and back at home with Granny.

       Like two gorillas in the jungle making love (you know they R Kelly verse)   Last night I'm in the garage making sure that I put my work badge away and just doing whatever one can do in a garage...which makes me think now.  But as I'm standing there I realize that there is a cricket near me so I shew it away. Actually if you know me I screamed and jumped away from it and it fled.  So I go back to whatever and I hear him starting to chirp.  Then out of no where the chirping gets way way way loud.  The crickets were getting their freak on.  It was like a room of multiple orgasms.  God they are so lucky to have that.  It lasted for like 6 mins of good ol' cricket lovin' and then it was over.  But if you have never heard crickets go at it it is crazy.  It almost sounds like a mutant cricket that it is so loud.  And no I didn't try to find them to watch I could tell they needed privacy or a cigarette.  Just the thought of bugs grosses me out but I'm thinking about wishing myself into a cricket for one fun night and then wishing myself back to the "Supermodel/Actor/Singer/Songwriter/Diva/Everything other's which they could be but can't" Superstar.  I'm so full of shit I make cows look bad.

       I had a fantastic day...   I was so involved in work today that I almost forgot to take a lunch.  What a shame.  I was like in hyper mode reviewing claims and stuff.  Man I thought I had it bad but damn some of these people are like "eww...I don't even want to touch you with a stick."  I made Cheryl laugh again today when I put on my afro wig and sang...It's your birthday to her for like the 50th time.  Kim B. is pregnant so a big congrats goes out to her.  Guess what?  I know you are dying to know...  I got to see Underworld again and it was even better this time than my virginal time seeing it.  I went with Manieka...I'll have to get a picture so you all can see the "supermodel" as my mother likes to call her.  But I can't disagree either.  Manieka's hair is sooooo pretty especially with the highlights.  After the movie we went to Romano's Macaroni Grill and it was so good I can't even begin to speak about it without my mouth drooling.  I had this drink called a Tiratini.  It's tiramisu made into a drink using Vodka, Bailey's, something else, and the vodka has Godiva white chocolate in it.  Ugh the ecstacy that tini brought to me.  Had some really good conversation tonight.  It has been eons since I last saw Manieka so we had about 6 hrs to catch up with each other.  Next time we will have to go bowling or to a club or something.  So Manieka thank you for a wonderful night.  It was way fun.  Aunt Velma:  Thank you for the email.  It is much appreciated.  Please keep this between you, me, Aunt Ganda, and mom.  No one else is to know.  I know you won't say anything but I figure I told Aunt Ganda so I have to tell you.  I'll call today and hopefully we can go to lunch.  I wouldn't mind going to the House of Rock.  Where is it exactly?  And I'll kick some ass with you.  Yah...ha...ha!!  Good night ya'll it's 1:02am and I am now tired and ready to fall asleep to a random movie.!!  And guess what .......no cravings today...yeah me!

       Today was a good day....   After finding out that someone I sort of knew overdosed on OC's it made me realize even more how stupid I was.  I'm so glad that I'm growing mentally and starting to appreciate myself more.    I want to send a special thanks to two people:  Manieka:  I thank you so much for taking the time to leave a comment.  I know that you were probably shocked to read some of the stuff I've been up to but I know I will win this battle.  You still sound as beautiful as ever on the phone.  I can't wait to see you on Friday.  You are the one person that I've always wanted to keep in touch with even if it is every couple of years because you were always the person that could brighten my day.  Plus your easy on the eyes.  My father thinks you are one of the most beautiful women he has ever seen and I'd have to agree.  See I'm blushing telling you this.  But seriously you comment truly meant a lot to me to know that you still acknowledge me as a friend as I have always done with you.  But I'm still jealous you got to tour Europe without me.  It's my dream.  Hawaii was wonderful but Paris and the other countries I'm dying to explore the architecture.  See you Friday afternoon.  Tricia:  Again I deserve to give you a big kiss and hug for being so non-biast.  You truly understand me more than anyone else I know besides April.  It's almost like you knew I needed help and you are always there for me even if it is just through your funny comments on my page.  Words really can't expres what a God sent you are to me for being so open minded.  When you quoted "Be who you are because there is no point in living if you can't be yourself" was one of the first things that started me on the path to wanting to make myself realize I have an addiction.  So again thanks and telll Cameron I said hello even though he won't remember me.  It's funny now that I think of it because you are such a great person I wish that Dan could have seen you for the amazing woman that you truly are.  But I'm sure he is watching over you and appreciative in his own way of what a wonderful person you are.  So there are my shout outs to two of my wonderful and supportive friends.  Mom is so open minded to the fact that I could be bisexual even though I don't want to classify myself.  She told me that she will love me for who I am no matter what.  Even though she doesn't agree with men being with other men she said that I can't help who I am and I have to be me to be happy or there's no reason to enjoy life.  So she is on the same wave length as Tricia.  I really just need a companion that I can really spend time with and just talk and talk and talk.  I'm good at that.  April you are my number one supporter and I know you always will be so don't think that I'm brushing you aside.  I would hope you know how much I love you and I hope the feeling is mutual.  Ewww incest...since we consider each other brother and sister.  You know I would do anything for you for a klondike bar....just joking.  Well enough blabbing...I'm getting tired and looking forward to tomorrow and going to dinner and a movie with Manieka.    Good night...and I thank God for giving me such a positive day and a chance to reform myself.  Now if I could only look like a super model I'd be set!!  But that will come in time.

      You know it's on ething to be deconstruction to property but it's another thing to destroy yourself.  God how stupid I've been.  Mentally I'm a total basket case.  And when Imean basket case I'm like an endless picnic basket full of dark thoughts.  Dont take this as me being all blah..blah...blah.  No I'm not thinking all homicidal or suicidal.  I'm just bored with thinking.  It would be great of me to think nice things all day but lately I've been at a loss.  Good God the song I'm listening to is "Cry Me A River."  Well I just need to build the bridge and get over it.  Right?  Anti-depressants just don't seem to work.  What is it with being depressed anyway? It's like I'm happy for so long but it just fades away and I'm in that shell again.  I don't know exactly what drags me down but something does.  Wether it be lonliness(companionship), my health or realizing what a big old addict I am.  I just don't know.  I told my mom today that I was attracted to another guy.  I have no clue how I had the courage to do it but I did.  I expected a "click" but she was okay it with as much as one can expect.  The thing is I don't want to define my sexuality.  I mean I find myself attracted to all kinds of people.  Male or Female it just doesn't matter to me.  I don't really want a relationship, which my parents say would do me wonders.  I wish I could just pop out of this mood.  Today has been an awful day of feening.  It's amazing the cage drugs builds around your thoughts.  When you try to concentrate on something you always seem to be distracted.  What I wouldn't give for some mental clarity.  I almost feel like I've been on a binge and I'm strung out.  But I'm not.  Pain management or the better word rehab starts on October 27th.  Hopefully this will have a positive effect on me.  Mom told me today that my doctor knew I was addicted to pain killers or what have you before she even told him.  See I knew people could tell it's just I didn't want to face it myself.  But time changes and I guess you finally "wake up" or whatever the quote is.  I'm really glad I'm lucky enought to have woken up at such an early age.  I couldn't imagine being a junkie in his late 30's and be worth noghting or ever worse dead.  But such is life...sa la vie.  At least I know I have friends and family that are cool with being there for me.   They have been there for a long time it's just that I've ignored the problem.  No more hiding this time...right?

       Ewww   This morning I realized why I hate being sick:  1.  You ache 2.  You're all discombobulated 3.  You get runny everything (eyes, nose, etc...) 4.  You get hot, then cold, then sweaty 5.  Here's the best one.  When you throw up you are prone to nose bleeds...at least I was.  Imagine that...not only does the puking part suck but as a consolation prize you get a bloody nose.  Work was so better off without me today.

       Here's a thought   So the other day my father and I were driving around Frederick when I came back from the doctor's and we had been talking about whatever and he had mentioned this:    "You are the best thing that could have happened to your mother and I."  And all I could think of was:  "But the worst thing that has happened to myself."  For whatever reason this has stuck with me over the past couple of days.  It's amazing to me how self destructive I am.  Wether it be when I drank all the time or was heavy into taking pills.  Regardless, I've come to realize that I am dangerous to myself when it comes to tolerance and pressure.  You see I made a pact with myself not to drink this weekend.  Friday night was a breeze since I slept it away.  However, Saturday was not so easy.  When April asked me if I wanted to go have a margarita I really wanted to.  But I knew that taking medicine I shouldn't.  But then to make matters worse it was either stay home and read or go to Frank's party.  Well somehow I managed to stay home.  Maybe because I took 3 sleeping pills so I would be too tired to go anywhere.  But I did it.  This is like the first time in a long time that I have been able to resist.  Now when it comes to pills I can't say I'm as successful.  Although I haven't been around any so I can't say for sure.  Hmm.  Realizing that you are an addict or an in the process of recovering/was an addict  is a lot different than I thought it would be.  Trying to buy pills, steal them, whatever it's just not cool anymore.  Thank God Charles Town and the latter is dry because I'm feening and not in a good way.  But somehow I'll manage just like I do everyday.  It's crazy that doctor's give you something to take away the pain but don't give you anything to take away the craving of what took away the pain.  Now I can almost see eye to eye with the people that go the all natural remedy way.  I woke up this morning feening for pills just like every other day but for some reason today was different.  Today I realized that wanting them this bad is not good.  I mean yeah I like the euphoria they bring but it is only temporary.  Plus Barb had said something yesterday about me being "stoned" all the time.  How does she know without actually knowing.  I'm glad that she said something..it's weird.  It's like she knew I had been bad without me having to say anything.  I'm tired of people associating me with the name "Pill Popper."  Now I have the stigma.  People are always asking me "are you still on medicine?" like they know I abused them and for some reason I'm sure they could figure it out on their own that I was.  Maybe this is just a phase but I really hope that it isn't.  I think I need to have more respect for myself and now that I'm starting to actually be myself I'm not going to let myself rely on drugs or alcohol for that temporary fix of emotions.  So whatever is whatever...I just know I don't want to be that person found dead from a night of too much fun.    I really think that I have this woman to thank for me starting to appreciate myself more:  Lyrics to Beautiful by Christina Aguilera  Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful And suddenly, it's hard to breathe Now and then, I get insecure From all the fame, I'm so ashamed  I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down So don't you bring me down today  To all your friends, you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The piece is gone and the puzzle undone That's the way it is  You are beautiful no matter what they say Words won't bring you down You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words won't bring you down  Don't you bring me down today...  No matter what we do (no matter what we do) No matter what they say (no matter what they say) When the sun is shining through Then the clouds won't stay And everywhere we go (everywhere we go) The sun won't always shine (sun won't always shine) But tomorrow will find a way All the other times  We are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down We are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words can't bring us down Don't you bring me down today  Don't you bring me down today Don't you bring me down today   Serious thought of the day:  "It's amazing to me how words can have such an effect on the mind.  But when they are sung not spoken do they really transform the soul."

       Teach me that again...   Last night was a total bust.  Ugh.  Aside from reading  Tale of the Body Thief  I had nothing better to do.  Ann Rice gets on my nerves now.  She totally had Lestat wanting to screw some guy named David.  Who I might add wanted to screw Lestat.  Then he said..."Oh I can't I just can't."  Please!  I was all like just fuck and get it over with so Lestat can move on and I can stop reading about David wanting him but not wanting him.  I would love to take a hit of acid and read some Ann Rice though because I think it would be pretty interesting the things you would see.  Not that I would ever do acid again.  But more importantly, I've decided that April, Frank, and I need to take syncranized swimming lessons that incorporates belly dancing and rap.  So if anyone has a recommendation for a teacher with these powers please feel free to comment.  Sometimes I think people read my mind.  Or maybe it's just the Ann Rice thing getting to me.  But  urlLink Cyn  wrote yesterday about stuff that totally makes sense to me today.  It's like my thoughts were transplanted on her page.  Except I have met to many hookers to want to snort something off of their stomach.  Also, the radio is psyhic too.  I will be thinking of a song and it will come on like within 10-15 seconds.  It's weird.    Thought of the day:  For a person as sane as me I sure do come up with some strange shit.

       I think...   I'm about to faint.  Okay so let me retract that statement about WV being boring because I've been reading through some blogs that were just published and these people are making me go all comotose.  Is it just me or are there a lot of boring teenagers out there these days.  And a lot of poets.  For the love of myself...these people are all like "Daddy said" and "bwah..bwa..bawa."  I feel like I'm reading but all I can hear in the background is the teacher from Charlie Brown because these people are fucking killing me.  Man fuck is my favorite word...have you ever noticed that?  And just for shits and giggles...I do look cute today...all prep school boy...if I were a clone I'd have to get with me.

       Ugh...   Today is all gloomy and shit.  Ugh.  I'm bored.  Although I did just have a super dinner.  But other than that today has been dull and boring.  I think that West Virginia may be as boring as it gets here in the United States.  Although I hear that Wyoming is pretty boring and Montana.  But those places are really BFE.  Anyway, I'm hoping that tonight is not as boring as the day has been.  Wish me luck for some good times tonight.

       Sometimes...   It must be noted that the world is full of crackheads.  Take for instance KK at work.  I thought well her husband is in the military and she is really nice and motherly.  Well guess what she is an undercover crackhead(not really she just smokes up).  But I couldn't believe it when she told me that she smoked a bowl to go to sleep Thursday night.  See there are just some things that you don't share with fellow employees...and that is one of them.  And even Cheryl is a undercover crackhead.  KK told me to ask Cheryl about smokin' up and beer bongs.  I know that this story will be interesting.  I feel like shit today.  Other than sleeping for like 15 hrs last night I did nothing.  Tonight I have to do something though.  I don't care if I have to stuff tissues up my nose just to go to WalMart I shall do something.  So anyway, I getting off here.  Susie W is stopping by so I can make up her advertisement for the Olde Town Christmas thing I do every year.

       On the road again...(Shout out to Willie...See April I know one of his songs)   Just got back from the doctor's.  I have been driving for like 3 hrs now.  My back hurts and I have snot clogged from my feet to my head.  Damn congestion!  But I think I'm the only person who gets sick and still manages to go shopping.  My father really wanted to go to the movies but I was like no because mom will be all like "you are sick you need to stay in."  So I told my father that since Underworld didn't start until 4:20 that I didn't want to go...I checked the times before making this decision.  But then I said let's go to Best Buy and let me buy some stuff.  So I got Boat Trip, Dreamcatcher, and two Coldplay Cd's.  I told my father that I was going to get drunk and watch television and when my mother questioned me on why I was drunk I was going to tell her:  "You told me that I couldn't go out so I stayed in."  Yah...ha..ha...mwah...ha...ha!    Later...I'm getting ready to watch Dreamcatcher.

       Color me envy...   So what is it with old women and lime green?  I mean they are a death's grip anyhow but why let in on the secret.  Today coming home from April's work and I saw this woman wearing a lime green polyester suit.  Hello it makes your skin look like it is already decaying.  She sort of had this olive/hunter green look.  Dying is one thing but looking dead is a crime.   When I'm all alone...   I still hear laughter.  Isn't that a weird situation?  I'm so entertaining that I laugh at myself.  Some people are born to be politicians, singers, lawyers and hookers...but I, I am born to be a SUPERSTAR!  (And yes I will do the pose).  There is nothing more entertaining then when you can entertain yourself.  It's so much cheaper than the movies.  All you need is your ears and voice and of course an open mind.  Yay for me for being stupendious.   A new store has opened...   As April and I were on the way to the store she informed me that we could go to Wong Mart.  I just love it when new stores open for me to shop at.  And I love it when people mispronounce words...like I so often do.  But the best part is that Wong Mart sells Chinese people figures.  I can't wait...I've been dying to start a "Miniature Chinese People Collection" for a long time now.

       Insomniac   I've comed to realize that there are some advantages to having insomnia however, yesterday I was able to experience the consequences.  Hmm.  Let me think here for a minute.  I managed to sleep for zero hours Tuesday night and 4 hours Wednesday night.  At work I was a complete basketcase from not having any sleep Tuesday night.  Anyway, here are the consequences for not being able to sleep in 4 weeks:  1.  Almost fell asleep driving to Baltimore 2.  Was in a pissy mood 3.  Could not enjoy Thanksgiving dinner 4.  Tried to fall asleep on the way home but couldn't 5.  Went to watch Will and Grace and collasped into a coma for 4 hours  Pros to having insomnia:  1.  Get a lot of thinking done 2.  Started to learn how to knit scarfs. 3.  Get a chance to memorize a lot of movie lines (I pretty much know all of Interview with the Vampire and Steel Magnolias) 4.  Can always claim temporary insanity due to lack of sleep if I ever get the chance.  Thanksgiving was good although I don't remember much of it.  I know I talked to my Aunt Velma a lot and she taught me how to knit.  Other than that the day was pretty uneventful.  I only ate stuffing, potatoes, mac and cheese, and turkey.  How pathetic is that?  There was so much more to choose from...I wanted Kielbasa and Saurkraut while I was there but forgot about it because I was full.  So I have some in the frig for later.  I just back from shopping...which by the way since I'm so tired has lost all of its charm...and managed to buy not a damn thing for myself.  I only bought Sharon her baby shower gift.  I got her a bib with a mom and baby duck on it, a robe with a baby duck on it that says "Just Duckie," the matching blanket/wrap thing with a baby duck on it, the matching wash cloth glove thing, and some sleepers to match it.  Carter's offers the best and cutest things for babies.  I hope she loves it.  I spent like $70 on it so she better.  Baby stuff shouldn't be that expensive but they are so worth it.  Anyway, I'm going to watch X2 and try to fall asleep.  Later ya'll hope that your Turkey Day was hella good and that someone's hangover has faded.

       Call me crazy   But I hallucinated and saw a Mercedes Benz of my very own in my garage parked next to my parents and poof I touched it and it is real.  Yay me!  I'm in love with my car.  Pictures will be posted tomorrow.  Tricia, Samantha, and Susan you all still fucking rock my world.  I miss you guys so much.  It was great getting to see you all tonight.  And if you could please tell Alesia that I said hello and I'd like to hear from her.  Kisses and hugs

       I will never doubt again   So I made this bargain with God that if I could get my Benz that I would not ask for anything for Christmas because I know that my parents really don't have the money.  I also said I would cut down on smoking.  No more cigarettes to and from work.  And I'm cutting back from a pack a day to 10 if not less.  So God has answered my prayers and I will never doubt him again.  No matter what I have been through I've tried to believe that He was on my side and never got a result.  Well finally He pulled through for me and I am forever indebted.  I guess God finally thinks it is time that I have a break for a while.  I had an excellent day at work and when I found out that my new 2004 C320 comes in tomorrow for pickup I knew He was watching over me.  Don't think that I'm trying to press upon anyone my views but I'm just elated at the results today.  I've been through a lot over the past three years to the point that I've held a gun to my mouth but now I know that no matter how hard life gets it is all worth it.  It is thanks to my family and friends that I've made it these 23 years.  I'd like to send shout out to  Tricia ,  April ,  Faustus ,  David ,  Cyn ,  Phil ,  Angelo  and especially   Patrick   (for at least acknowledging that I exist when I commented on his page and has emailed me.  I would love to meet you and hopefully develop a friendship because you seem like a really brillant person that I could use as a friend in my life.  And I'll take you for a ride in my Mercedes...and dinner and a movie my treat...not a date but just a way of saying thank you Patrick.)  for allowing me access to their webblogs and sites because each day they are able to cheer me up and make me look forward to what the next day will bring.    So everyone new and old to me thanks for just being you.  Night ya'll

       A nightmare waiting to happen   So as you all know I am a chickenshit when it comes to movies.  I debated this afternoon if I was really prepared to see Gothika.  April and I were down at the river with Darien so he could play for awhile.  Well anyway, I wound up going to the movie this evening.  Let me just tell you that I thought I was going to shit my pants.  Oh but yes...I was scared by the Sixth Sense okay.  The dead girl in this movie is totally going to visit me tonight I can tell and I'll have a heartattack and die.  Remind me again why I subject myself to such torture?  I think it's because I like dead people.  After all, I've managed to communicate with several...if you know me you know about my friend Susan and the weird shit that happened with her mother.  And then there is Bob.  Enough said.  Now I sound like a complete lunatic.  Aside from that I've managed to eat a sausage patty and three tablespoons of macaroni and cheese.  And for some odd reason I have cramps again.  I think I've becoming the woman I always knew I could be.  There is hope for me yet.  Night ya'll  P.S.  And Manieka we so have to go see this movie this upcoming weekend and eat again at the Macaroni Grill.  You get all the bread again.  Oh and I bought (this is so surprising) the new Brittany Spears and Blink 182 CD's.  I am totally a rockstar DJ.

       Hell Yeah   Mommason let me drive the Benz today to see if I would like it.  I'm in love.  The Poppason is going to take my Jeep in tomorrow to get me my new 2004 C230.  I shall call it Betty and she shall be mine.  And we shall drive cross country together one day.

       Reason number 5,548   I am a self-proclaimed "LOSER."  No social life, no nothing of a life.  The only life I have is a work life and aside from that is the life of solitary confinement.  There has to be more than this.  Or maybe life it just at a stand still now.  I have no clue.  I just know that life is boring at the moment.  I'd like to think that I'll have the life I had when I worked at the casino.  There was always something going on.  Life wasn't so boring.  I've have become dependant on other people's lives.  Yes, I am using them to escape the stagnent pond I am currently living in.  This morning I have managed to read  urlLink Patrick's  complete site.  I found it quite amusing and even more interesting than most of the other journals I read.  I have to say though that a lot I have read up to this point and time there reminds me of this past week.  It is really scary.  On Friday Cheryl won a gift certificate to Joann Fabrics.  I asked her what she was going to make and she said curtains thus, leading to the outburst of The Sound of Music's Raindrops on roses.  How does this tie into Patrick's journal you ask...look for the entry about his neighbor masturbating on the front porch.  Example two...Starbucks...hello do I not have an addiction to the Venti Mocha Frappacino?  I think so.  The Starbuck's at work is about a block away so it is quite hard to resist.  Example three, Patrick's mother ruins his first date...this didn't happen to me but the whole drug in food thing...yeah it happened and it was one of my stories for Cheryl on Friday.  Manda R. at AB & C brought in Hash Crispy treats for Christmas two years ago.  I spent the whole day babbling, munchin', and asking for more crispy treat.  Maybe the things that I think and have happen aren't as "Close Encounters" as I thought they were.  Finally, I can say I have read someone's journal that at least in fragments coorilates with things I have experienced.  I've never had anyone masturbate outside my window but it could happen.  Aside from feeling self-pity for leading such the "non-glamorous" life I think that medication that quack of a doctor put me on that I had to stop taking because it caused me to vomit, be drowy, have migraines...(this reminds me of how I use clump fifty thoughts into one sentence.) has really messed up my appetite.    Thursday's menu:  A half of a turkey sandwich A piece of chicken Brocolli florets  Friday's menu:  A cup of Apple sauce A cup of vegetable rice  Saturday's menu:  Egg sandwich 3 Chicken tenders  Yeah consider me quite the heffer.  Maybe that's why I've managed to drop 25 lbs in about 2 weeks.  Not that this is a bad thing.  And people have even noticed.  How exciting.  People always used to tell me that I will get bigger and bigger if I keep not eating...well I think that's bullshit at this point.  It's amazes me how people think people that have a little extra weight cause this by eating and being gluttons.  Hello there that would not be me.  I eat very little which I know is not good for my metabolism back then but now it seems to be doing something totally different.  And my doctor is evil...always saying lose some weight.  When I went to see him he didn't even acknowledge the 25 lbs that somehow disappeared.  And why is it that doctor's never take into consideration the amount of muscle you also have.  My legs remind me of tanks.  They are enormous...not fatty big but muscular big.  I would love to know what each one weighs.  I never realized why the coaches in high school always wanted me to play football until now.  So I will remain losing weight until I feel I've reached where I want to be.  Please people don't think I'm this huge cow that takes up two seats on a plane...I'm just a big guy...I don't think I could ever be really thin or even look thin because Dr. Golden told me that my bone structure is above average.  He said I could lose 5000 lbs but never be thin looking because I'm too thick in the bone structure department.  See I knew cheese would do me good in the long run.  So there goes the dreams of being an Abercrombie & Fitch model.  I guess I'll have to settle for Big and Tall...eww...

       Yeah whatevah...   My parents got a new car today.  Anyone car to take a stab at what they are driving now?  Hmm...could it be the car they told me I didn't need?  Why fuck yeah.  It's the Mercedes I've beening wanting now for a year.  But the good news is that my father is taking my Jeep to trade it in this week.  As long as the payment doesn't exceed $575 a month I'm cool with it.  That is a lot of money for a car but I really love it.  I want mine in black.  Their's is silver.  Please please let this go through for me...I won't ask for anything for Christmas I promise.  Nothing except the ring my parents ordered for me.  That is all just a ring and a new Benz.  Is that too much to ask for?    I've decided that if my career as a bellydancer doesn't pay off that I could become an erotic poet.  I have tons of little dirty thoughts built up in this mind.  My new poem "Whisper" is quite dirty.  While the language used doesn't seem must more than me babbling it deals a lot with having sex and the whole process.  I am very proud of it.  Make sure you check it out and tell me what you think.   urlLink My Poetry Corner   Well I rented "The Gift" with Katie Holmes tonight so I'm going to watch it and try to get some rest because my damn back is hurting for sitting out by the bonfire tonight.  Oh and Brittany's new CD is bangin.  The song Toxic and Breathe on Me makes me want to do naughty things to people that are "hard up and horny."  You know who you are.  Night ya'll

       Liz Phair so rocks my world   Who else could sing about "Hot White Cum" and make it sound like a beauty product?  Give it to me, don't give it away Don't think about what the others say My skins getting clear, my hairs so bright All you do is fuck me every day and night  You're my secret beauty routine Na, na, na, na, what my body has seen I am lookin' good and I'm feeling nice Baby you're the best magazine advice  Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum  I'm gonna pull you back down between the sheets Everything is fresher when the day is sweet In the morning light when you're already on the phone  Face it, one of these days Without you I'm just another Dorian Gray It's the fountain of youth It's the meaning of life So hot, so sweet, so wet my appetite  Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum  Face it, one of these days Without you I'm just another Dorian Gray It's the fountain of youth It's the meaning of life Baby you're the best magazine advice  Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Gimme your hot white cum Your hot white cum  Oh yeah baby I want to market it.  And just think it doesn't take much to get it.  April we have a new mission and that is to rob the nearest sperm bank.  Yes we too shall become millionaires.  I wonder if robbing a sperm bank is a crime?  I mean it can all be replaced in a matter of a couple days right?  Right.  And to think of all that times I didn't save what Liz Phair considers a beauty product.  Damn me to hell.    I love that fact that I can check my email when I go to work.  Aside from that I spend all day reading blogs, checking my horoscope, keeping up on the news.  The extra $15 a month is not a factor any longer.  I use my fair share of the internet away from home.  I was receiving mad emails today.  Everytime I would check it I would have at least 7 emails.  I felt for once to be "in demand."    And   urlLink Patrick  , thank you for the kind words left under this morning's entry.  I am going to wash my blankets so they can be all warm from the dryer.  But I'm feeling better.  However, the cover idea is just too tempting considering it is cold out now.  And the comment you left on Faustus' page you must remember that you have to take care of yourself sometimes.  In the words of my best friend April "it is either feast or famine."  So when a drought hits gratifying oneself is the best way to at least curve the illusive "frustration."  I really need to stop talking about this because now I'm getting bad bad thoughts.  And I don't need to get any more frustrated than I already am.  I need to be alone now.  But I'll keep you in my thoughts for a feast just remember to do the same in return.    urlLink Tricia   we so need to have a sex toy party so I can at least dream a little dream.  And when are we going out together.  You have to go to H2O with me.  Being the crazy woman you are maybe you can get me a date.  And I'll bring them to the party.  Your water must be toxic.  Shit.  I want to start a colliation.  Yes...really.  However, it deals with public restrooms.  The Colliation for Proper Use of Public Facilities.  I hate public bathrooms and today just reinforced my reasoning behind this.  It's the end of the day and I figure it would be safe to take a piss because there couldn't possibly be anyone in there.  Wrong!  Three people in a row taking the big flush.  I thought my nose was going to permanently detach itself and runaway from the smell of shit and sour milk.  And aside from the fumes that made me want to curl in the fetal position and die the sounds echoing from the stalls almost deafened me.  How can you possibly shit louder than the toilet flushing?  How?  What did you eat for lunch?  Don't do it again.  So this weekend I'm buying air freshner and putting in the bathroom with the following note attached to each bottle:  "If you sit and take a shit, please be nice and spray me twice."    I'll have to do this when no one is in there of course.  But I'm afraid to enter again.  I might now make it out this time.  I can only hold my breathe for so long.  And the fact that you have to inhale through your mouth so you don't smell anything is the worst thought ever.  But enough about shit.    Today some Spanish people were playing music and I was on break with Kim.  We managed to flamingo dance.  And I must say it was quite nice.  If only Britney could see the potential I have as a dancer...she would die.  Dancing doesn't come to everyone but to me it's a talent.  And I've got a new blog...it's not a journal...it's  urlLink My Poetry Corner .  I put a link in on the page to.  I'm a pathetic and boring individual.  God I hope I don't die alone with 50 cats at my side.    Well I've babble enough.  It's time to go "Perculator" some coffee.  Oh and last I had a Starbucks Mocha Frappacino today and it was complete ecstacy.

       I feel so sorry for women   They totally get cramps every month.  Me...I've got them now and would never wish upon my worst enemy (i.e. the feeling that they bring).  God forbid I get period cramps.  I really feel sorry for women especially those who get bad cramps.  If I should happen to start bleeding from someplace I shouldn't I'm seeking professional help.    Yeah and I am so so over last night's little tantrum.  But I could certainly use some more sleep considering it's only 5:17am.  Well I'm going to finish  urlLink Legally Blonde 2 .  Bruiser Woods, her Chihuahua, is gay and has a thing for pastel colors.  You should see the skort she dresses him in...too cute.

       Right to the Point   I am so fed up with everything.  If I truly were courageous I would either o.d. on drugs or blow my fucking head off.  And I sometimes wonder why people wind up killing people at work and blowing buildings up.  Goddamn everything right now...I swear I am about to just implode.  I'm am just tired of medical bills, living arrangements, my social life, and everything fucking other thing that life has to offer.  But this all spurs from getting a call today that I owe an additional $1300 from my last surgery.  Let's see now...this brings me to about $5000 or some odd dollars just in medical bills.     FUCK EVERY FUCKING THING UNTIL I GET PAID TOMORROW AND GO SHOPPING   Yeah...that's a problem too.  But I'm starting to realize this.  Oh and I'm proud of myself for not buying any drugs being under all this stress.  Yay me for being clean and sober.  Just say it Tricia..."Quite your bitchin' Paul."

       I must be an exceptionally evil person   Because who else almost gets ran over by a Martin's bread truck and an UTZ potato chip truck in one day?  Satan must have my number.  I just hope it is the one I always use.  Today I look like a poet or a man going to a funeral.  Choice of clothing:  1.  Black khaki pants 2.  Black socks 3.  Black turtleneck sweater 4.  Black Calvin Klein boxer-briefs  Yeah it's an overshare but I thought it was important you know everything matches.  Even the hair on my head is black.  Do I know how to accessorize or what?    So I should be at work right now but I took a half day to get accupunture done on my back.  Unfortunately, the appointment was cancelled two days ago and I figured "Hell you already put in for the time off so let's just pretend that you went."  I am not to syked about getting this done so maybe it's a sign that the appointment was cancelled.    And if a doctor ever tries to make you have surgery tell him "No" with a firm and aggressive tone.  Because it will leave you broke when you start getting the aftermath of bills.  I'm not broke but I could always use more money.  Like the $80,000 the doctors have gotten from the insurance company wasn't enough they have to bill me.  Such a little war mark for such an expensive hobby.  Just tell the doctors you would prefer to be given narcotics for the duration of your life...it's cheaper and you feel better.    Well since I have time on my hands and I've managed to leave my book at work again I'm going to start "Blackwood Forrest."  I'm hoping Claudia makes an appearance in this book like she did in Merrick.  I really don't know how to follow a series.  I like to jump from book one to book five and then read two, three, and four.  Later ya'll.

       Ugh...   I thought for awhile that sleeping and relaxing was starting to dominate my life several months ago.  Now I wish I had those days back.  It's one thing to be tired, yawning and what not but it is totally different to actually sleep a full night.  I haven't done that for about 2 weeks now and I'm starting to think that my insomnia is coming back.  I haven't had that since Freshman year of college.  However, there has to be a plus side to going to bed at 12am waking up at 1am, asleep again from 145am until 230am, asleep from 300am until 412am, asleep from 500am until 527am I just haven't found it yet.  Sure I get more time to get ready for work and can drink some coffee and read but I'd really just like one night's sleep.  I don't even think I'm sleeping when I sleep...I think it's more like I catnap and that's it.  Blast.    PEACE BE MINE  IN THIS SLEEPING TIME  DREAMS BE SWEET  ALLOW ME SLEEP

       Lord give me the strength   To not smother my parents tonight as they sleep.  God leave me alone while I'm reading.  I mean my clothes arrived but damn so things are just more important right now.  I really need to get out of here...when the medical bills are paid I will own a mansion all too myself unless of course I get married within the next century.  I can picture it now...me on the front porch of my house alone with cats and I'm steadily sneezing due to the allergy.  And then I go to rock in my rocker fall out of it and break a hip and die for the sheer pleasure of not being bound to a walker.  I need to shut up.

       Swiftly did not come soon enough   Per the entry below you can see that I wanted with everything that I am for this day to be over swiftly.  Well no one answered the prayer.  Why did I even bother?  Excuse me for thinking a miracle could happen.  It must be the brat in me that thought TinkerBell would come to my rescue but alas, the little green whore didn't.  Damn her and Peter too!  How long has it been now? Um let me see?  I think around 5 or 6 months and my D&G sandals still are on backorder.  I have a feeling that I shall never get them.  I could resist wearing them until the spring or summer.  However, if it should happen to get warm out again, which I'm seriously doubting due to the current weather situation I would then infact, wear them.  They are so me and I know I would love them if only I had the chance.  If I had the picture I would put them on the blog but I've misplaced the address.  See TinkerBell you have fucked up royally this time now you will perish.  Whore.  Today at work I managed to cut, file, and buff my nails.  This is a weekly ritual of course.  Now my nails are beautiful and all shiny without all that clear polish mess.  I am proud of them.  Though I could never be a hand model I'd like to think there is still hope in the eye model department.  Mess this dream up TinkerBell and I'll definetly have to cut you.  You mini-gerkin.  I've surprised myself lately with my journal entries.  They are becoming more and more organized and to the point.  Maybe it was the drugs I don't know but my head is a lot clearer these days.  Again big yay me.  So...I thought that I could not possibly become more addicted to blogs than I already am but I learning daily as I check the blogs from my phone that I've caught the blog bug.  The daily ritual is that I wake up, check the blogs I read, get ready for work, work, come home and check the blogs, and then watch tv or read, and then you guessed it...check em' again.  But when you have reading material such as Faustus' blog,  urlLink Search for Love  how can you possibly resist.  And Angelo's blog  urlLink The Pennylane Journals  has me rolling.  If only he would post more.  Well besides everything else going on in the world like Michael Jackson having Neverland raided by the FBI again I read at  urlLink FoxNews  the results of Aaliyah's autopsy.  I have to say that I'd rather the information never have been published because whoever wrote the opening line isn't very empathetic.  I will keep the thought that she died on impact and did not suffer and that's how it will be.  I think and autopsy should be kept private.  Yes I did read it but it was there so what was I to do?  In the words of Cher "if I could turn back time" I would have skipped the information.    Well it's time for a shower and movie since I left   urlLink Tale of the Body Thief   at work.  I think tonight calls for Too Wong Foo or something lighthearted and full of queens.   Here are some things to read before bed...         By the way this one is actual giftwrap you can purchase online:

       Could I be anymore Queer?   Yeah I admit it...I went to a Home Interior party tonight.  I enjoyed it.  And yes there was a $60 purchase of shit I have no clue where to put.  But that doesn't matter because I'm a shopoholic and the world is mine to purchase.  Within reason of course.  The best purchase of the night were these plaques that are inscribed with William Shakepeare quotes from his sonnets.  I'm in love with them and they too shall be mine.  Anyway, I am so ready to get married.  You are probably asking "What has brought this about?"  Well I really can't say but trust me I'd be willing to get married if the opportunity arose.  I'm just waiting to be proposed to that's all.  I'm more about being dominated in situations like this.  Plus I could just imagine with a combined income all the decorating and shopping I could do.  So if you want pop the question we don't even have to know each other but your initials should be P.D. because you said you were looking to get married as well.  Ah the suspense.  But other than buying home decorating supplies this evening I went clothes shopping.  Who me?  No way?  Yeah, I did.  I got a new long sleeve Timbaland shirt, a cream and brown SouthPole sweater, a black turtle neck SouthPole sweater, and a light grey turtle neck SouthPole sweater.  Add this to the clothes that I ordered on Sunday from Old Navy: pine and merlot ribbed long sleeve shirts, another black turtleneck sweater, a rust turtleneck sweater, a pair of gray fleece pants, khaki and sand shorts, a long sleeve shirt with some surf logo on it, and several tee shirts...you can see that I am clearly an addict.  Now only the addiction is to clothes...not drugs!  Yay me!  I must say that I look cute in the Timbaland shirt and it brings out the blue in my eyes...not that they aren't blue without it.  I paid for the colored contacts so I claim the blue is natural.  Just like the blonde hair I know is deep down inside wanting to show itself.  But for now I'll have to settle for black hair and blue eyes during the day and hazel at night (when the contacts are out if you're not keeping up with the program).  In case any of you haven't noticed I'm trying to change my writing style.  I am getting a little bored with the spastic thought writing process.  So I am trying to use paragraphs and complete my thoughts the best that I can.  So do you think I'm doing a good job or what?

       Quote of the Day   "Missy Elliott is in everything these days April.  I mean she in my pants right now you just can't see her."    Feeling inspired by the new music that MTV has provided I decided that I needed it.  And so I got it.  Hmm...being a part-time pirate is quite rewarding.  Afterall I did bring a smile to many people's faces today when I played them "Gay Boyfriend" by the Ukes of Hazzard.  It's sad that I know the words to the song already and I just discovered it on Faustus' website.  If you haven't viewed the video yet look at the link from a couple days ago.  I have to say that the song really is wonderful and should be an anthem for all faghags across the world.  Anyway, I decided at 8am this morning an oldie but goodie would be quite nice...hence the repetition of "It's time for the Perculator" blaring from Cheryl and I's cubies.  And little did I know but Cheryl felt the rhythm just as much as I did.  Fuck all the other bullshit...(this is in reference to work)...we wanna party and dance.  Yeah...and that happened all day long.  I even surprised myself my doing some Hindi dancing to "Milkshake" by Kelis and "Indian Flute" by Timbaland and Magoo.  Esther wanted me to show her the perculator and I busted out a little.  But Cheryl got the full effect.  Cheryl's quote of the day is "Between the fat and cigarettes I think I'm done trying to keep up with you."  I even broke a sweat at work today...not that it was from working but it happened there so it counts as working extra hard.  But between two insurance companies I managed to save them $11,000.  Last week was around $5000.  So yeah I do manage to do some work.    I get the MRI on my brain this Saturday.  Maybe they can prove to the world that I do have a brain.  If not then consider me "Stem Boy" because that's probably what I've been living off of for 23 years.  Having said that I told April I think the people I work with take random hits of acid daily however, I'm still tripping off that one hit from a  couple of years ago.  Between the acid and ecstacy I'm permanently tripping and rolling for life.  It's good to know that I haven't fell yet or broke anything rolling about daily.  Today life was good.  Poetry time my children:   Big Booty Hoe   Big Booty Hoes are neat, They keep their hair did, And polish on their feet.  Big Booty Hoes can be a slut, Open for business, Just to sell some butt.  Big Booty Hoes are all the rave, Living the high life, Never in a stark cold cave.  Big Booty Hoes are just like you and me, Bitchy, slutty, gold-diggin tramps, We're all the same you see.  Big Booty Hoes remind me of your dad, He wanted, couldn't get  Using his hand the only tool he had.  Big Booty Hoes remind me of yo' momma, Shh don't tell yo' poppa, I fucked her I don't need the drama.  Big Booty Hoes should rule the earth, Busting, stiffening, hardening, All men's girth.  Big Booty Hoes are so divine, Come here baby, I've made you mine.

       Classmates.com   I'm totally addicted to this website now that my cousin Donna sent me there.  But the bad thing is is that to get all the benefits you have to become a gold member which is like $40.  And I found out that a certain someone is registered there with email address and all but I can't email her until I get the membership.  I'm under scrunity by myself trying to figure out if it will be worth it or not.  I mean there are other people that I could email, not just her.  Anyway.  My father asks last night "So where did you and April go Friday night while you were in Hagerstown?  Not that Gay Bar again?"  And I replied "No we went to some other bar I can't remember the name of it."  Then my mother asks me this morning "You and April went back there didn't you?"  Me in response to all the fucking drama over a damn bar "But of course we did mama!"  As a matter of fact we hit several bars Friday night but all the others were boring.  At least H2O had awesome music and a well maintained pooltable.  Oh and the maniquins that line the dancefloor are absolutely fabulous!  Especially when the one guy danced with it and grabbed it's boob.  The things people do when they are intoxicated.  Sexually harassing a plastic oversized barbie without a head?  Come on.  I can't wait to go again.  Anywho, I keep on forgetting to send in my letter for a LOA from Shepherd for last semester when I had to have back surgery.  I've got to get on the ball and finish that...yeah because that is important.  I can't wait to graduate...if it should ever happen.  I've got to get my ass on the ball and get ready to start Strayer in January.  Financial aid is the first step since it's way more that a thousand dollars a class without books.  I usually pay cash to go to Shepherd but Strayer is a whole different ballgame.    Oh and besides graduating college within the next century I no have a list of goals to accomplish short term (30 days) or before death which ever comes first:  1.  Change my last name to Hohenadel...could you just imagine Paul Hohenadel and my initial aren't affected PCWH!!!   2.  When I acquire the new last name learn to yodel...lay he...ha..ha. 3.  Learn to bellydance with Cheryl and April 4.  Discover a new species of plant, animal, vegetable, or mineral and be extremely rich like the girls on MTV's Rich Girls.  And have the title archeologist added to my list. 5.  After I have all the money that I want get liposuction and be a supermodel for Gucci or Isaac Mizrahi.  And also be an eyemodel since my eyes are gorgeous.  And last...  6.  Know the truth to if Britney Spears actually sings or lip sinks...she claims she sings live but I think it's a crock-o-shit considering I saw her in concert and it was way way way too perfect.   Get over yourself...you stupid fuck up   Let's just be honest Mr. Insecurity Lacking all things especially purity.  Constantly ragging on others in society Shut the fuck up and listen quietly.  You are no better than her or I  Get the fuck over youself don't think to cry.  Friendship, love, whatever you think Being honest, forgiving, caring is your missing link.  One day it will all come back by the power of three One here, two there, diseased don't turn to me.  Trust you oh but not on your last breath Sometimes I see you and wish only death.  How can you be who you are but hate them so much God you annoy me like fire to the touch.  No future in society with you being you Open your mind and start anew.  But it won't happen you fucking bastard Your life is going to be one big disaster.  And to think I even devoted sometime Insult to injury to me was the crime.  If I could there would be poison in your cup Get over yourself...you stupid fuck up.

       Through the looking glass   Slit my wrist Drain me, bleed me, end me.  I haven't the courage to  You are the answer to my peace.  Find me hiding here Deep within the forbidden city.  Touch not the fruit of knowledge Allow this knowledge to show you the way.  Forge within me the markings of the latter Make all new come to an end.  Show me the way to my salvation It was lost within when self disappeared.  Crave the path that shows no emotion Lend me your ear and the steel of you.  Pressed against all that was ever known On the other side of the looking glass.  Ah...tonight at H2O was wonderful.  Let the happiness reign and the cowboy hat appear for a second time.  Yee haw motherfucker.

       Wee Hah...and a big fuck you   Question:  Why can't people be more like me and my friends?  evil and lacking morals?  mean and testy?  bitchy and proud? inner divas with decorating and fashion knowledge far more superior to that of Isaac Mizrahi or Heatherett? all of the above?  I think if people would get their heads out of their asses since they think their shit doesn't stink the world would be a fucking mecca of happiness.  And it seems to me through much research in the bad supervisor department that most supervisors seem to accommodate their huge and bloated heads quite well.  Get a fucking bottle opener and crack open the can of shit you are packing and maybe you would be a better person.  Incase you are wondering yeah my new supervisor is a prudish dick at least he is starting to be.  He is so uptight that I balls in the back of his throat when he talks to me...that must really hurt?  And he dresses in tacky sweaters...like baby blue and white with snowflakes...hello...I think I may faint from the ugly factor and Cheryl understands totally.  Oh yeah and his hair is black with a white stripe in the front...can we say Peppy?  I want to be him for Halloween but I'm afraid of the fashion consequences...I mean go to the mall much?  But I'm going out tonight...it will be fun...there will be much drunkiness and sloppy speech with massive cussing...I'll will enjoy!

       Blow Me   So this one time I was driving down the road and it was extremely windy out and I thought my Jeep was going to fall apart...and it just happened to be today.  Damn has it been nothing but windy.  It even threw a hawk for a loop and knocked it off balance and it almost crashed into my windshield.  But previous to that I almost ran over someone while backing out of the gas station today.  I laughed at the bird...cussed at the woman.  I think I am a sensitive and responsible driver...don't you?  Remember STOP signs outlined in white are optional!!   Fear of You   Lying in this bed again A million miles between us.  Strangers not to oneself But to the other an uncharted world.  If it is thought right then so be it If not then what will happen after tonight?  Happiness is found in closeness But sadness becomes the common denominator.  A world apart from the norm you see That is as far as they see not past their insecurities.  Speak not loosely keep it hidden Let only I be the muse to the voice that is calling.  Closeness, emotion, lack of trust, hate The outside world is always there.  Ideals filtering and processing not soon after Keeping the distance between.  Admiration, mimickery, trust, love all repeated Pity, blame, emptiness, loss of self emerge.  Without the id or I found inside There is no fear of you.

       The Change   It appeared, or seemed to appear as a sheet, White as the falling snow on a seemingly perfect Christmas Eve. Creeping and sliding it found the way to her mind, Like a virus it began to spread engulfing her spirit.  Her life appeared, or seemed to appear as the sheet, Hanging from the line yearning to be with the others. On the outside there lived a masque with several faces, None of these the one that actually displayed her beauty.  It appeared, or seemed to appear that life could get any better, Stuck in the cracks of a washed out road it lay dormit. But what if there was the one possiblity for change? The chance to change the crack into a beautiful path?  It appeared, or seemed to appear a wonderous thought, Filled with all the goodness and richness of a queen. But who knows yourself better than yourself? And who excepts that change of its first visit?   Black   Strutting across the tin roof with the grace of a dancer, She had a mission.  Eyes of the goldest sun were entranced on the mind, She saw her mission.  A burst of tingles swept throughout her body, She felt her mission.  Creeping to the well lit door as fast as light, She visualized her mission.  Entering the room with happiness, She found her mission.  Echoing with delight to the black haired figure, She conquered her mission.  So what do we think of these two poems?  I wrote them 8-15-00 and it's about time that I shared them.  I really like the first one because it tells a lot about myself and my emotions.  Poetry is so rewarding...i think the reward really comes when you are able to share your poetry.  I don't share much of my own because a lot of it is best left unsaid to others because it's pretty painful stuff that I'm not ready to let go of yet.  Anyway...the second is just a fun little poem about a cat coming home to her owner.  Hope you enjoy.  God I just babble.  This is a pretty long entry.  And prayers to Cheryl's grandson Austin who has to have tests ran on his heart.  He is only four so keep him in your prayers.  He has to have an EP test done soon which is a cathader in your heart.  Night ya'll

       Sometimes...   When I'm all alone I think dirty thoughts and touch myself!  Ooh..you bad bad white boy.  It's amazing to me how self gratification can be so rewarding.  It's like I have no one to answer to but myself.  And if something should come up and I have an STD at least I know I got it from myself...right?  Right!  Anyway, work went way good today.  I was so impressed with myself that I said allowed "I can't believe how happy I make me."  I've come to realize that I am extemely vain and I do think that song is about me.  But there is nothing wrong with having high respect for oneself.  Now if I start talking in third person then maybe there is a problem.    When life hands you a lemon you trade it in on another car from the dealership.  My parents new 2004 Solara is so not working right now.  Everytime the dealership fixes the front end alignment or say they have it doesn't work.  My mother is going all crazy over the Lemon Law.  So I've been researching that on top of other things.  The Lemon Law is quite interesting though I must admit.  I read several pages of it so far.  Okay...did I just admit that outloud and on paper because if so deem me the "dork" of the day.  Well I'm off to get some dinner since I had to fix it because my mother had to go pick my father up from the dealership tonight.  God I sound like a whiney teenager and I'm 23.  I seriously need to take up not mentioning my parents soo much because it might seem that I depend on them and I don't want people to ever get that impression!  Agh!  Those of you who know me keep your comments to yourself!!  I mean it.

       Bring on the warm and toasty   It's quite cold outside for a change.  Finally the weather is getting cold and not hot and cold and cold and hot.  It needs to stay one damn way because my sinus's are driving me absolutely buggy.  I keep getting dizzy spells because my head is all clogged and what not.  I got home from Baltimore about three hours ago.  I really like my grandmother's new furniture.  It is much more modern that I thought she would go for.  Plus a lot more stuffier and bigger than I thought she would go for.  And the colors are way darker.  But she's been changing things here lately...scary she is actually painting her toenails red and her fingernails red...usually they are a granny pearl color.  I love spending the weekend with my grandparents.  Although Saturday I felt like complete shit and so do my Granny so we didn't see much of each other but more of the bed.  But Friday night we talked up a storm.  It was like two old friends reunited after 10 years.  I'm going back down next weekend.  I really enjoy spending time with my grandmother.  She makes me laugh.  And my Pop pop makes me laugh when he makes her mad.  It's the greatest.  It's almost like a soap opera but without all the nice looking people, money and sex.  It's the geriatric version of "As the World Turns."  And I love every minute of it.

       My life so resembles a Danielle Steele novel   Without all the romance and good looking lovers.  But there is all kinds of impairments and life threatening situations and blah blah blah.  Anyway, so I have to have an MRI done on the dome just to check for a tumor.  We think that it's this medicine that is making me sick it's called...I can't remember the name of it.  I really cannot think of it.  Anyway.  I get to have my first blood work test thing done as well to test for everything.  I am getting checked for all the Heppa's and Hiv's and all the STD's.  Not that there is any reason that I should have any of them.  I am happy to report at amends have been made between "you" and I.  I am so happy I don't know what to do with myself.  I can't wait to see him.  If you don't know who it is oh well.  It is a him though.  I can't just keep typing you because it would start to sound weird.  And I am totally rockin' a new rat tomorrow or next Wednesday because I feel it is my responsiblity to make Baby Girl a lesbian.  Yay rat lesbians!!!  Good night ya'll!!

       For some reason I think things are going to get worse...   So on my way to work today I get this weird feeling.  Not like happy joy joy...but like I don't feel really good...pass out in the middle of 340 weird feeling.  I have to pull over on the side of the road.  I had to wind up calling in because I couldn't make it in.  There was just no way.  I have a really bad headache.  Who me?  I have had a headache every morning for the past month.  Plus some other things I've noticed are changing.  So here it is 11:24am and I've decided to look up symptoms of brain cancer.  Something tells me that this is a pretty valid disease considering what I've been experiencing lately.  My vision is getting worse, my headaches are getting worse, I am nautious all the time, I vomit almost every morning, my motor skills are going for shit(my typing sucks anymore), I am dizzy a lot, and I get numbness in my legs and arms (but that could be from my back surgery).  Gee...out of the like 10 symptoms they had listed I met like almost all of them.  Yay me!  I know that it's not something to make fun of but it would be my luck to have brain cancer.  Wouldn't it?  I mean I am one of the meanest people I know so I guess I would deserve it?  So I have to tell my mother tonight that I need to make an appointment to see an oncologist to find out what the hell is wrong with my head...I've been thinking this for like a month now so it's nothing new...I just hope that I'm wrong because I really don't want to have to go through something like this.  Like back surgery wasn't enough.

       Just between me and you...   Halloween was a bust this year.  Aside from being Mimi from Drew Carey and winning the costume contest at work yesterday was boring.  Although Rose did come up last night (she's my aunt) and we watched Willard.  Which I must say that I throughly enjoyed considering I love rats.  Socrates the one rat in the movie is sooo adorable.  That's why I've decided that on Wednesday I shall get another rat.  Baby Girl needs a friend and it's only fair that I provide the best for her.  Right?  I wish I hadn't shaved my moustache, but I know that it will grow back.  I missed my appointment for Strayer University today...oops.  I hit the off button on the alarm clock instead of the snooze button and didn't get up until 3 this afternoon.  That's why it's never good to take four sleeping pills I guess because you always over sleep.  So now I have to email the admissions woman with my reason.  I feel like such an ass.  Anyway, I've got to get ready to take the movie back and find another to watch tonight.    Check out the new site:   urlLink Upside-Down Hippopotamus   And just between me and you....I'm starting not to let it bother me as much.  Try to figure that one out....

       I was shocked...   When I learned mashed potatoes were the number one comfort food followed closely by macoroni and cheese.  Who the hell, when depressed or sad, goes for mashed potatoes.  What ever happened to chocolate?  Which brings me to another point about hamburgers.  There is this place in L.A. that sells $50 burgers because they have chocolate truffles in them.  I couldn't imagine eating beef and chocolate but who am I?  My trip to New York in February cannot come soon enough.  I'm ready to pull my hair out at work.  And that was explained over and over again when I finally swooped into work.  Yes swooped.  Not even fiddling with Hair Weave Barbie could ease the pain of a shitty day.  I really should live the "cliche" and become a hairdresser.  I mean I am damn good at it and the hairdresser that I go to...Crystal thinks I would rock.  But when you go through any type of beauty/cosmotology school you have to do pedicures.  That shit is not gonna happen.  Feet are eww!  Could you imagine giving pedicures to 60 year old women.  Oh the horror!  Who says that in that one book...it takes place on the Congo River in Africa...I know I read it in high school...Oh...brain is now functioning...  Heart of Darkness...but who is the character?  Doesn't it start with an S?  He dies I know that.  I just visited  urlLink Danny and Paul  and posted on the message board.  Life is grand because I got a response to the question in lightning speed.  I have communicated with Danny's Paul.  Never in my wildest dreams have I ever thought I would communicate with someone while on television but is sure to have an impact on the world's views.  Oh but my dreams are finally coming true.    Well I've got to go get some medicine since the cold doesn't want to cooperate with the "me feeling better."  Everyone have a great night and visit Danny and Paul's website it is very informational and the music is good too.  Here are some questions I asked and got response too by Danny and Paul.  Look I'm beyond validated...they posted a comment.!!   urlLink Question 1   urlLink Question 2   urlLink Night Ya'll   urlLink Question 3

       Just when I think   I don't have enough blogs to read I've began another.  Please welcome to the list of blog links (applause):   urlLink BilBored   The link is added to the side.   It's under  urlLink The Traveling Spotlight .    Aside from adding the new link I haven't gone to work yet today.  I can't tell if I'm really crying or if my eyes are just really watery.  If my sinus' don't get into shape soon I'm going to remove them myself.  One can only blow their nose so many times.  I feel like I've been punished by for some awful thing I did when I was a child and now I've taken on the tissue responsiblity of 10 people.  Shit.  I bet you that when a movie star gets sick even that is glamorous.  As for us common folk...it's quite revolting.

       Soup de Jour   Today's special is Matza ball soup.  And I must say it is quite yummy.  I always seem to get what I want.  Make one call and when you get home...bam...shablang...there the soup is.  Bought two new Hair Weave Barbie Heads today seeing that I cut the first one's hair.  When when cut is made the inner haircutter comes out in me until there is basically, no actually nothing left.  I also bought a NeoPet for Cheryl and I.  Her name is Bumsheka.  She is something called a Usul.  Have no clue.  But she talks and sings.  Here is a picture of my baby:     Going to Baltimore on Thursday.  Hopefully I'll find something to do on Wednesday night seeing that it is New Year's Eve.  Other than that I'm discouraged to learn that Dorian Grey is a waste of time...says Bilbored.  So that book is over and done with.  I really must finish the Vampire Chronicles.  I don't know why I start them and stop them.  I'm on the VI book.  Not too many more to go.  But there are so many other books that I must read.  For instance  urlLink Cunt , I do have this book but can't find it.  The beginning hilarious.  Now I'm reading  urlLink Paige by Paige , which is a little amusing.  However,  urlLink Why Girls Are Weird  is extremely entertaining.  I'm waiting to get  urlLink The Broke Diaries  back so I can read it for the 5th time.  If you ever buy a book in your life please buy The Broke Diaries.  One of my top ten book choices.  But then again I have an odd taste in books.  But it is well worth it.  Everyone I've let borrow it has returned with a smile on their face.  So may decisions...  Such little brain mass to sort them.  Night...tonight is Matza ball soup and Buffy's 2nd DVD in the 5th season.

       To Faustus:  Thank you for the link man...it is greatly appreciated.  Now my blog and I feel validated.    You are one hot motherfucker   The elvish people have my highest regards of being "hot motherfuckers."  Yes, these magical creates/people are hot.  Way hot.  Is it wrong of me to want Liv Tyler and Orlando Bloom in a threesome?  No I didn't think so.  These two elvish people are the hottest thing since hell not freezing over.  Liv Tyler has that classic beauty.  It is almost painful to look at her in Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King because she is so undeniably breathe taking.  Orlando Bloom with his golden locks is oh la la.  Sizzle me a steak and put a fork in...this elf is on Fye-yah!  Being that I find myself now attracted to the likes of ficticious creates in ficticious movies I am having myself committed.  But you must agree that these two are some sweet eye candy.  Now how does one lure these two in thy own bed?  I have the power of the ring...(i.e. the sterling silver Lord of the Rings ring my parents got me for Christmas)...does it have control over them?  Pray that it does.  Anyway, enough with the lust that has filled my heart.  The movie was absolutely wonderful.  However, it saddens me that it is all over with.  There is no more to wait for.  The 3 hour and 20 minutes of movie time were enjoyable aside from the person that brought a baby to the theatre.  The first hour flies by and the second sort of creeps by.  But when you get over the first two hours it is filled with battles, magic, amazing CGI (computer genterated images), and the scenary is remarkable.  Personally, I liked the screech those evil winged dinosaur things gave off.  It hurt my mother's ears but I found it to remind me of the Evil Willow in the 6th season of Buffy.  And I loved the scenary.  I sort of got lost in the artwork and missed some of the movie as I'm sure most do.  So I would definetly recommend seeing the movie more than once because something is always missed.  Hooray for me.  I bought the 5th season of Buffy.  I'm caught up at the current time.  And I purchased Linkin Park the first album.  So I'm off to eat some chicken noodle soup, color in my Strawberry Shortcake book, and watch Buffy.  Does anyone have the receipe for Matza Ball Soup?  I had it last year and I really want to learn to make it myself.  If you do please email the receipe to me or leave a comment.  Toodles...

       Surprise   April left for Mexico this morning.  A belated Christmas gift from her parents.  Two weeks in Mexico...San Diego....with her aunt and uncle and their kids.  What am I going to do for two weeks?  Huh?  And to top it all off she ordered me the third season of Buffy on DVD and it hasn't been given to me yet because it hasn't reached her yet.  This is the best season due to the whole Buffy vs. Faith thing.  They would make the hottest lesbians if they would just hook up.  Anywho, now I have seasons 1, 2, 4...why didn't I buy 3 you ask because my favorite episode "Hush" is on season four.  I'm going to see the last "Lord of the Rings" today with my mother.  The Mercedes dealer gave us free tickets...that was nice of them.  I plan on buying the Fifth Season of Buffy on DVD today.  I really want the sixth season because that is where Willow goes all "Psycho You Killed My Lesbian Lover" witch on everybodies asses.  And that is my second favorite episode because how hot was she all eviled out?    Aside from not doing a thing yesterday.  And when I mean not doing a thing I didn't even go see April before she left to go to Mexico...I feel really bad.  I am gonna miss her for two weeks.  I've decided that I'm not cutting my nails any longer.  Does anyone know how annoying it is to trim your nails, file them, buff them, and then have to do it two weeks later?  It's a big ol' pain in the ass.  Those of you that know me in the physical sense know that my nails grow extremely fast and they always have to be cut at least every other week.  My father hates my nails growing out but I will file and buff them when they break.  So far only one has broke and that has to do with me trying to see if I could break it.  But I know this won't last because I get tired of my nails being long and eventually cut them.  These bitches are strong this time...damn all that vitamin C.   urlLink Tricia , it was wonderful of you to recognize that I kept up my part of the bargain about Christmas presents.  I didn't ask for a damned thing.  Nothing.  Nahta.  However, my parents did not keep up their end of the bargain.  While they didn't afford me the luxury they usually do here is the list of what I got for Christmas without asking for:  1.  Lord of the Rings silver ring with elvish engraving that spins. 2.  Bringing Down the House 3.  Daddy Daycare 4.  Master of Disguise...can you tell I'm obsessed with movies...I'm up to like 600 now. 5.  A brand new crisp $100 bill 6.  Socks 7.  Shirts 8.  A $50 gift certificate to Borders Books...this was from my Dad  While this doesn't seem like much it is more than I expected.  I thought they would get me some odds and ends.  I had told them that I didn't want anything but as you know being an only child the parents have to do something.  But I did keep up my part of the bargain and did not ask for anything.  I'll post a picture of the ring tomorrow evening...it's quite nice.  Anyway, New Year's is approaching and I have no one to party with since my April is in Mexico.  What am I going to do now?  Maybe I'll go to New York for New Years?  Hmm...wonder if I can talk anyone in to going with me?  Probably not.  And for those of you that either sent emails or left comments about Dorian Grey...this would be  urlLink Faustus  and  urlLink Bob ...I just wanted to tell you that I searched 3 bookstores Friday and all three were sold out.  So one day I'll own the book.  And by the way has anyone ever seen the movie "The Portrait of Doria Grey?"  Does it remotely follow the book?  Is it worth my while?

       Later that day after...   Got home from the movies.  It was funny because majority of the audience was children.  They were completely silent as were the parents.  I loved the movie.  Now I want to move to Never Neverland.  Does anyone know a plane company I can charter there?  And where can I get a fairy?

       The day after...   Aside from having a good holiday there is always the day after.  This day is used for shopping and hitting sales and thinking about what a great time you had the day before.  I have yet to do either.  Actually it's 1pm and I have yet to get a bath.  But I have managed to find out what time "Peter Pan" starts.  I must tell you that I'm fascinated with any type of story or movie that involves being a child forever.  I wish that I were still a child.  I also wish that I didn't leave my hair weave Barbie at work so I could do her hair.  So maybe I still do have a little child left in me.  Well my back is hurting in the "I need some percocet or vicodin because I can't tolerate this" way.  So I'm going to take some percocet and get ready for the movies.  I will blog about it I'm sure seeing that I have nothing better to do when I come home.

       C-Day 2003   I was very happy to see my family today.  Especially, my grandfather who has not been up to WV in over 3 years.  I know this may be his last Christmas with us so I am grateful that it was at my house.  I'm also grateful for the gifts that I received from each family member.  I'm starting to think though that I don't want them to buy me or give me anything for Christmas since the other older cousins don't get anything.  I know they give to their children and all and that I don't have any so I get but I really think it should just be about the children...i.e. Keith, Destiny, Peewee Al, Ethan, Phil Jr, Jonathan, David, and Dylan.  Because the children are the ones that the holiday is all about.  Not a 23 year old who has no significant other and no children.  But lest the gives are very much appreciated.  And Aunt Ganda since I know you read this page I really do love the book light.  I tried to find batteries for it to use tonight but alas who every has AAA batteries.  Damn.  What I am most grateful for was the following:  My family was in the livingroom.  My grandfather was sitting in the kitchen alone because of the oxygen and everything.  I came out of my room (oh I didn't mention I was sweating and running a high fever all day) and wondered why he was all alone.  So I made some meatballs and sat down next to him.  We talked about the weather, the food, what he was going to spend his Christmas money on.  Just small talk.  But it's something that I'll have in memory for the rest of my life.  Just thought I would write it down for safe measure.  Hope everyone is warm and toasty tonight.  I can't believe it's already over.

       Pictures of me as a child and the hat I wore to work today...         And people wonder why I'm confused.  My first Halloween Mom dresses me up as a Baby DragQueen.     The Church/Gardening Hat           Hope that everyone has a great Christmas, Kwanza, Hanukkah and that you remain safe throughout as well.  With love and kisses to everyone.  Peace.

       11pm and a question for you all...   I just finished watching something on Seabiscuit.  The movie or documentary.  It didn't say anything about the horse being dead so I asked my father the following questions:  Me/Paul:  "Dad is Seabiscuit still alive?"  Dad:  "No Paul he died in the 1940's."  Me/Paul:  "Are you sure because I thought horses lived to be like 70 years old?"  Dad:  "You are getting to be as bad as Jessica Simpson."  OH MY GOD!  My dreams of being a ditsy blonde are coming to a reality.  Now all I need is highlights (I refuse to bleach my entire head) and I'm like 3/4 the way there.  Was this really a dumb set of questions?  Please be honest...  Oh and Faustus if you happen to read this entry who the hell wrote that comment about "homosexuality being this la la la...blah...bullshit?"  I'm sure you don't know but damn if I wouldn't like to respond to that comment.  I have a few past comments to that effect and it pisses me off everytime I see comment like that one others pages.  I guess it's better to just not say anything because that is...(oh my god I really can't think of what to say...I sort of wanted to say that is the way to make them ever angier by not responding but then I wondered if the kill them with kindness sort of fits in?).  Yeah I'm 3/4 the way there.

       Horseshit   Cookie day at work went splendidly well after I fixed things.  I go to the table and only a dozen of the sugar cookies are gone.  I'm thinking to myself "Paul you made Faustus' cookies and they are wonderful yet no one has really eaten them.  Damn them all."  Aside from there being too many cookies I figured that maybe people just didn't notice them.  In return I took the cookie container and marched around to everyone telling my sob story about the original "dud" cookies.  Then I informed them "This receipe is from Faustus who lives in New York.  This receipe came all the way from New York and you haven't tried the cookies?  Here are two."  Needless to say my co-workers loved the cookies and a few asked for the receipe.  See you evil bastards you didn't take the cookies therefore, you get no receipe.  Never if you ever run across the Rosie O'donnell bar thing make it.  It is too sweet.  Now I understand why my beloved Rosie is the size of a mack-truck.  It almost favors a ring-ding/devil dog/Dairy Queen brownie earthquake.  Too much.    I've delcared that having the inner diva that I have that the new me is "Glamour Princess."  The kit contains a tiara, silver bag, and a Petal mirror as a microphone, and The Go-Go's.  When you throw all the ingredients together you pretty much get me lipsyncing to The Go-Go's wearing a tiara and holding a pretend microphone and handbag.  At work I might add.  Well Cheryl is on her way over and I have to start dinner.  I'm thinking baked chicken with a lemon zest and parsilled(

       Last thing for the night   * Looks of disbelief and wonder*   I can't believe how many people have left comments today.  I am especially surprised that  urlLink Faustus  visited my blog.  I am so honored that I don't know what to do with myself.  I never knew he had ever read my blog.  Oh but now I feel that my life is full and that my cookies with Faustus' receipe will be filled with oodles of goodness.  That's all.  Night everyone.

       Cookie Monster   So in light of events that have taken place about 30 minutes ago I am feeling quite uninspired.  I decided that I would make sugar cookies but that they needed a twist...a new taste...a dash of diva.  So I found a quick and simple sugar cookie receipe.  I baked the first batch as just plain sugar cookies.  They tasted wonderful...like the old fashioned sugar cookies my grandmother makes.  Where they are a little sugary but still have a sort of shortbread taste.  Wonderful I thought.  Now to add my twist and make them "my signature cookie."  So I took butterscotch chips and almonds to them.  There were 5 chips and an almond in the center.  Introducing Butterscotch Almond a la Sugar Cookies.  My father was the taste tester for these cookies.  And as luck would have it he couldn't get enough of them until I told him he had to stop eating them because they were for the people at work.  So I made the cookies.  All 6 dozen.  I thought to myself I really want to have the cut-out sugar cookies (i.e. Santa, bells, snowmen..you get it) so I made another batch of the dough.  It turned out fabolous for making the shaped cookies.  They were baked.  Turned out great.  So after all the cookies are cooled and I am sure that my new invention cookies will be a hit tomorrow I get a shower and relax for a while.  So then I say to Mom and Dad that we have to try one of the cookies again to make sure that they are suitable for tomorrow.  We all taste the cookies after they have "cooled," remember we had only tasted them warm out of the oven before.  Well let me tell you something they were so soft and fluffy.  Perfect texture and color.  Brown tipped edges.  However, and this is the outcome of 2 hours of baking...sugar cookies that taste wonderful when them are warm...but when they cool they taste like complete shit.  They tasted like flour.  I put in 2 1/2 cups of sugar.  It only called for 1 cup.  Where did the sweet, sugary taste that they had when they were warm go?  Why do my sugar cookies always turn to shit?  Why?  So needless to say the second batch of cookies were tossed in the trash.  The first batch I made are good but they don't taste like they did when the were warm.  Here is the best description I can give of what they orginally tasted like:  Nutty due to the almond Extremely sugary due to the overuse of sugar Buttery A slight hint of butterscotch  Now they taste of all purpose flour.  So needless to say I will be baking a different kind of cookie that I had orginally wanted to bake.  They are called "Paper Thin Brown Edged Sugar Cookies."  This is the receipe that my mother made years ago.  She couldn't find the receipe for me so I decided to use the online receipe like she suggested...it is a dud.  So she somehow remembers the receipe after the fact of me baking 12 dozen cookies.  These sugar cookies always turn out fabolous.  These are the only sugar cookies that I can bake that turn out good.  Why do I always try to use a new receipe that will never turn out?  Huh?  I should know better by now.  Mom is helping me with these cookies because my back is hurting really bad from standing on the ceramic tile floor for 2 hours.  Thank God she found her receipe.  I am forever indebted.    I told her that if she didn't want to help bake them that she could go to the store and get the pre packaged ones but then I thought "That is cheating.  Christmas cookies are supposed to be baked from the heart because that is one of the few things that still remains a Christmas tradition I will not cheat."  So onto another 2 hours of baking.  Please wish me luck.  And Jess, if you should ever visit my site again thanks for your comment about FAO Schwartz.  I love that store and would hate to see it go out of business.  Have you ever been there?  And also if you have been there isn't the hall of magnents faboo?  Thanks for visiting the site dear...I only have a few select people who read so it's nice to see others stopping by.  Have a great holiday!!  Smooches people!  I out for the rest of the day.  I've written too much and baked too much.  What I really need to do is smoke too much and passout.  Oh but if I still did drugs...I found the bowl Manda R. made me when I worked at AB & C...it is so cute.  She told me I had to use it before I died and I will if I ever decided to get smoked up again.  How I would love to have some of the hash crispy treats she made that one time at work.  Memories.

       Tomorrow   Is cookie exchange day at work and I need a receipe for Sugar cookies.  I looked on the internet as my mother says there has to be one on the net but all I got back in response to the search "simple sugar cookie receipe," is a receipe for a simple pot roast.  Never knew there were meat cookies...now the thought of baking is ruined.  But I must bake..and knit my scarf.  I feel so Martha Stewart today.  Except it's so cold I can't feel my feet...maybe I'll try knitting socks or leg warmers.

       It's about 45 minutes later   And I've managed to read up to September of 2002 on David's blog.  I remembered that I had wanted to ask him if New York has Coinstar yet and never did.  So I did today.  My Aunt Ann who just came back from Manhattan and went to Macy's and Saks without me told me last night that FAO Schwartz is going bankrupt.  I told her she is a crazy disillusioned bag and never from her mouth should those words have come.  She however, swore that it was true.  I ran to my room and got my FAO Schwartz bear and gave her the finger.  Life at the moment is wonderful...except for:  My runny nose My strained eyes that will not stop hurting My phelgm My being cold all the time My having to work tomorrow  But I'm planning a trip with Aunt Ann...a.k.a. Skeletor...to go to New York for a couple of days in February.  She will pay for the FAO comment when I throw her into one of the chandeliers in the Barbie world floor of the store.  Yes I do remember the big clock and loving that they had every Barbie imaginable...and most were in glass cases and it was all white and decadent (as a toy store can get).   Ahh New York...Times Square...4am...a homeless woman dressed in potato sacks...with plastic red rose in hand...chasing me and two friends...  Me knocking Chrissy and Christy out of the way to escape the haggard being and then getting lost until 6am trying to get from East 57th street to West 57th street....have I ever told you that my real name is Jessica...and my last name is Simpson?

       Chicken salad to go please...   You all I have something extemely important to announce:    I think I'm pregnant, with twins!    I have really had the craving for chicken salad and romaine lettuce.  That is all I managed to eat yesterday and here it is and I am feaning for it again.  What will I do when I run out of chicken salad?  It will be like the time I ran out of Vicodin when I was a huge druggie...I'll fucking go insane.  But, the happy train just arrived and reminded me that I went to Costco and I've got it all under wraps.  Something is telling me that April had sex last night.  You did didn't you?  Aww...you naughty naughty piggy...you has sex with the little Charles Town guy didn't you?  Yah...ha..ha?  I must not remember stuff well.  Really.  Because I had read all of  urlLink David's  page and I really didn't remember him saying that he was from Maryland.  I read all of Patrick's like two weeks ago and I swear the only thing I truly can remember is him tripping on acid in college with a date and his mom.  Other than that I draw a blank.  My mind must really be giving up on me.  I mean yeah I can remember all the words to "Our Town" by the Go-Go's and any other song lyric you throw in front of me but when it comes to remembering reading I'm just like a big blank canvas with maybe a few scattered thoughts.  My mission on earth must be to remember as many songs as I can so that when I go to hell I can be an entertainer.  Anywho.  So now I am reading the whole site again...it shouldn't take that long it's only a year and some odd months of blog...

       One more thing for the day...   Last night I told my mother that my father got her the following for Christmas:  "Mom guess what Dad got you for Christmas?  A vibrator that doesn't need batteries."  An my favorite(and no I've never used one...I mean favorite funny ha ha)  "Mom I wanted to let you know that Dad got you a double headed dildo for Christmas....surprise!"   It is like 6 hours later   And I have yet to get out of my old navy fleece pajamas.  But what I have managed to do is watch almost all the episodes of "Rich Girls."  They are slowly but surely becoming my role models.  I wish that I could have lots of money and really not know what I was talking about all the time.  So basically all I need is a lot of money because those of you that know me know that I'm the second coming of Jessica Simpson (i.e girl who thought tuna was chicken).  Yeah I am pretty smart and know a good bit but there are those times when I ask questions like this:  Questions asked to April:  "April do you think if I adopted my own street that I could get arrested for prostitution on the street I've adopted?  I mean I own it sort of...well?"  "April do you think that in the world there is some place named "somewhere?" Like Somewhere, Minnesota?"  Question asked to Cheryl:  "Cheryl, when you look at a picture do you ever wonder what the person was thinking about at that moment that the photo was taken?"  This wasn't a stupid question until I added..."or what color their natural hair color is and if they have ever worn a thong?"  There are more but I really can't think of them at the moment.  Sometimes I wish I could go through life being a total ditz (  Anyway, the next episode of "Rich Girls" is getting ready to come on and it's one I haven't seen so I'm off to see them go on a shopping spree.  Oh but before I end I wanted to let everyone know for lunch I had a chicken salad sandwich that was on this amazing flatbread with romaine lettuce and stuff.  It was way yummy!

       Hmm   I'm wondering how my journal entry from the 18th has anything to do with someone wanting "young pussy," as left on the comments.  Anyway, Akinyele, which is so not this person's name it's the name of the group that sings "Put it in your mouth," shall only get ahold of old wrinkled twat.  Thanks for the comment babe better luck next time.  Today I really want another tattoo.  Seeing that I only have 9 in total I think I need to make it even.  Don't ya think?  I'm not exactly sure what I want to get though.  If I decide by noon I'm getting an appointment and having it done this afternoon.  I think I want a ring permanently tattooed on my middle finger that says "Fuck You" but in scroll work.  That sounds pretty out of the ordinary huh?  Maybe not.  I've also thought about getting Ganesha tattooed on my other foot since I already have the Om symbol on my left foot, that way I'll have a pair of Hindu symbols.  Hmm...as of the moment I'm a guy that is 40% Czech, 40% English, 10% Black Dutch, and 10% Jewish (these are % guesses but they are probably accurate) with Chinese and Hindu writing and Celtic imagery tattooed throughout his body.  I should have been born Egyptian.   The lead singer of  urlLink Trapt , Chris Brown is very hard to see in the video "Head Strong."  So for those of us that want to know what he looks like...and it is quite worth it...here is a picture:     I happen to find the song "HeadStrong" wonderful so I thought I would add the banner for awhile for those of you who have never heard the song you can hear it if you click the banner above.   Aside from hearing Trapt all morning on MTV and VH1...I watched videos from 5:42am until 8am and saw the video 4 times I've been listening to Sarah McLachlan's "Fallen."  I quite enjoy it.  More than I thought I would actually since I banned listening to her after she sung the song at the end of Buffy when Buffy had to kill Angel.  But now I must start anew and just forget about that tragic evening of my life.  Plus it brings back other stuff too...that I won't talk about.  I have no clue on what I am going to do today besides possibly getting another tattoo.  Christmas shopping is done, it's cold outside, I have a sinus infection, and yet I want to do something so I'm not bored all day long.  Maybe I'll go see Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King...yes that's what I'll do...or maybe I'll go buy a crack rock and smoke it...yes that too is a possiblity...or maybe I'll dress in drag all day and go to Shepherdstown...of the three options I'm sort of leaning to...  Dress up in drag while high on crack and go to the movies.  God I'm good at my own event management.  Anyway, I need to find something to do that is at least a quater percent productive.  Knitting I'm not in the mood for.  Eating is out of the question.  Drinking alchoholic beverages...unh...maybe.  Cussing at people and making them cry...priceless.  Write more later everybody...and Akinyele....EWW!

       El Doctoro   Went to see my doctor today.  Found out I do have a serious sinus infection.  I thought this morning that I was going to pop my eyeballs out from the bathroom/toilet activity I had going on this morning...no...I was vomiting....I didn't want to say it but then it sounded like I was masturbating while having diaherrea.  Anywho, the doctor said it's a good thing that I came to see him because it started to move to my lungs...and we all know what that means...pneumonia.  So he gave me some antibiotics and some vicodine tussin (oh hell yeah baby).  So I'm set for the duration of a snowy weekend.  Yes for those of you in hotter climates this will mark the 5th snow of December.    And please don't think that I was depressed when I wrote all the stuff yesterday because I'm not.  I just had to write what I was thinking about because if I didn't it would have bothered me all night thinking about how to get it out of my head.  I'm doing great.  I'm not transferring departments...I just can't.  Even though it would be better for my job qualifications and what not I just can't leave Cheryl.  I'm not basing it on her feelings about me leaving I'm actually realizing that I look forward to going in each day to see Cheryl and Kim.  They make my day so great and enjoyable that I don't want to give that up and be in a padded cell answering doctor's insurance questions all day.  Plus I've heard that the doctor's offices get quite rude (cussing and the such) and you can't cuss back.  Fuck that!  Anyway, those of you that know my father know that he never cusses or claims to.  I've only heard him twice in my 23 years.  So we were driving and this guy cut in front of me and almost made me wreck.  I'm so glad I have a button to turn cussing on and off.  I yelled "You stupid jerk."  What was supressed from coming out was "You fucking asshole learn how to fucking yield motherfucker," as I gave him the finger.  And I wanted to do it so bad but Dad was in the car.  So after we stopped for dinner and my father left with my mother who followed us home I was driving home by myself with them following from Frederick to home.  Anyway, I pull up at a stop sign let the person go and low and behold another work van hauls ass at the same time almost causing me to collide with him.  One fucking car at a time asshole.  Needless to say my wish was granted and I got to do the whole "You fucking asshole learn how to use a fucking stop sign you fucking bastard," as the middle finger went up.  The only bad part is my father probably saw the finger go up.  I'm waiting for them to get back from the store to know.  But even if he saw me when I was singing on the way to the doctors I made sure to sing all the cuss words.  I don't even know if he noticed that but oh well I'm old enough to make that decision.  But in a way I wish I had his tolerance for not cussing...  But then what the fuck would I say all day?

       When at work I had to write   It's weird to think about how we can never relive another day.  Would we change anything if we could?  What difference would it make in our future?  We can only remember those days and think about what could have been done differently.  Not that I would change much, if anything at all.  I think I would have played more, studied more, and tried different foods.  Just small things that seem to bother me today.  I should have kept more people close to me and not pushed them away as I most always tend to do...just to know that they are doing well.  I'm pretty content with me at the present time but, I'm starting to realize just how much of a lost soul I am.  The truth is that I don't want to be found.  I'd love to stay hidden to myself because only I understand me most of the time.  Yes, I appreciate my family and friends but I dream of just being alone.  I feel like I'm in my own political party as a "separatist."  I don't really think much about current events or the other bullshit in the world.  I find myself wanting to break free from society and just be the loner I have always been.  Even as a child I kept to myself for most all of the day.  Even at school I would sit alone, eat alone, and for most of elementary school play alone.  It's not that I didn't have friends I just liked being with me...again alone.  Sometimes I wonder if this is odd for a person to wish themselves to be free of others or if it is normal and people just deny themselves the truth to what they have always longed for...self.  It is difficult for a lot of people to understand this concept of being alone and enjoying/loving every moment of being by yourself.  Everyone always tells me it's because I haven't found that special someone and things will change, "give it time."  But deep down inside, even though a snuggle buddy would be nice, I just want to be left alone.  When I want to be around others or communicate I'll do so but if I don't just please understand my psyche.  Not that it is that easy to grasp.  Sometimes I wonder if I fully can grasp it myself.  I think, and this may sound crazy, that when I die my heaven or "paradise" as Dante says will be an eternity of just me.  Yeah I'll admit that I do crave company sometimes for long periods of time but I am always led to the same place of wanting to be alone.  I think about all the people around me at work and how if none on them were here and there was a defening silence how grand it would be.  I do enjoy their company however, I'd much rather prefer to be left alone without distraction and just do my job.  Even in the car when I'm alone I love the feeling of it just being me driving wherever and being able to do this alone so that I absorb the whole trip.  I'm tired of making other people laugh and helping them cheer up but when I'm happiest (quiet and distant) I'm told there has got to be a problem or that I make it hard for them to deal with me because of my mood.  Obviously, I wouldn't be so defensive if they would just step back and keep quiet.  I love to go into my own world.  It gives me time to think and just be myself even if it is all mentally.  I feel happy just being silent and having my mind race with thoughts and ideas.  You get to know yourself so much just by thinking about stuff.  Sometimes, I wish that I were on my own.  Coming home each night to my little apartment and doing what I want to do with no one else around.  Maybe I am just trying to live in a fantasy world.  I don't know but I truly know I would enjoy it.  Despite what other people try to force feed me.  I wonder if this will ever happen?  Can it?  Probably not but it would be wonderful.  There are times when I just close my eyes and block out the world and it is wonderful to me not hearing or seeing anything or anyone.  But anyway...another day is passing that can never be seen or experienced again.  At least I have my journal to remind me of what I had going on this or that day to look at years from now.  After I wrote all of this at work by the end of the day I was ready to go home.  Leaving work I had volunteered to go to Professional Services which means I would transfer departments for about 5 months out of the year.  Well when everyone found out it was an outcry of do not go.  Cheryl was most upset.  For the first time in a long time I felt that people wanted me around.  It felt good for awhile but then I realized just how much it is all based on me being the goofy/silly person they can turn to just to make them feel better.  I may have a good personality when it comes to making people feel good but I'm terrible at not satisfying myself.  When I hurt people like Cheryl who told me "I never cared if any of my other cuby buddies left but I am devistated now that you are going to leave" I feel a need to not do what I think I should do.  Maybe that is my flaw that I give of myself but never fully satisfy myself.  Yeah there is the material aspect which I always take care of but the emotional side that is always neglected.  Life is such a bitch...and for me questioning if I would want to be born if I had the choice I'm most certain actually 99% positive that I would say no.  Is this a bad thing...I don't think so.  My mother got really upset when we were talking about this one time and I told her if I had the choice I wouldn't have been born which made her extremely upset and I can understand why so the opinion changed to an I'm just joking answer.  If you had the option to be born would you take it or leave it?  Have you ever even thought about it?  I have as you can tell.    Well it's almost 6 so I'm going to get a shower and knit or do something constructive.  And Aunt Ganda it's different for you not worrying about cuddling because you have had someone for the past 17 years to do that with but for those of us that never have it...it's a pain in the ass.  I just want to wake up some days and be able to see him/her/someone beside me sleeping and watch them sleeping and when they wake up feel their arms around me.  So yeah maybe my thoughts at work aren't exactly accurate when it comes to me wanting to be alone but I've had someone and I just pushed them away in the end.  Whatevah...

       We Got The Beat   Among other things I have found that I love The Go-Go's more than most people do.  I listen to them to and from work and whenever else in between.  I am declaring myself a total fag.  April, you must learn to appreciate them...you will love them.    Has it come to anyone's attention that I need a fucking snuggle buddy?  Huh?  Has it?  I'm at a loss.  Even my huge Bedtime Carebear is just not filling that void any longer.  Yada...yada..yada.  Case in point some needs to snuggle me damn it.  Today at work I managed to do absolutely nothing except for take one of Cheryl's snowmen hostage.  She decided she was leaving early and I told her that if she did one of her prized handcrafted snowmen would be taken.  She left.  In return, Fifi the French whore snowlady was taken hostage and a ransom note was put in her place.  She is hidden...ya...ha...ha.  Cheryl will have to pay the ransom to get her back...a Mocha Frappacino.  Tomorrow evening I will be wrapping Cheryl's Christmas presents because she hates to do it.  In return we will have dinner and watch the BirdCage while we have Wrapping War 2003.  It will be most enjoyable.  "Oh the precious...I love the precious," and she will remain missing until a later date.  Angelo...hmm...why have you not been writing for the like 7th day in a row?  We seriously need to talk about this.  I'm having withdrawls Angelo of the one liners that rock my day.  I know you have finals and everything but at least blog something.    Well everyone I'm off to watch "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen," however, the vampire is a woman so I don't get the title yet.  And knit somemore of my scarf and eat.  You all have a splendid evening.

       So yeah...I'm pretty pissed   All my old comments are gone.  The funny ones are gone...Angelo leave the underwear comment again please...I truly love that one.  They did some random update on our comments and erased all the old ones...damn them to hell.  I have a major crush on several people's blogs I'm reading.  It's not actually a crush it's just that through their writings I'm sort of in a  " please let me meet you so we can talk for hours over a long dinner "mood.  Damn why can't these people live around me.  It's one thing to be attracted to someone physically but it is totally different to get the "warm and fuzzies" from reading their journals.  Aww...come on people move to Maryland or West Virginia...please.  I'll cook for you and take care of you like a housewife would.  I really need to get out more...really?  I'm just wondering if the people that I find fascinating and alluring know who they are?  Hmm?  Wonder if you can figure it out?    Maybe I'm just lonely I don't know?  or maybe I'm ready to settle down with someone.  I'm looking for my little blog angel to come whisk me away and make me laugh at night when we do nothing but snuggle.  Yeah there are two clues into who the two people are.  Figure it out yet?  But I really do want the sentence to come true soon.  I also want to adopt a child.  I want a little asian child.  I feel so Angelina Jolie right now...but I really want a child in the worst way.  I now feel like a woman going through menopause who has wanted aanother baby all her life and just realized it may never happen.  How depressing?  Good night my loves wherever you are.  I want to snuggle now...snuggle under some warm blankets.  I have to go get Baby Girl.  Write more tomorow.  P

       Orn...nah...mental...   Thought it would be a good day to put up the christmas tree.  Went to Wally World.  Mom wanted it red this year...(oh but if only someone would come ah knockin for the red light special.)  so she bought red garland and bows.  I bought the remainder:  Red christmas lights 50 new ornaments Red christmas bulbs  Yeah the list may not seem that long but try buying 50 new ornaments.  I must be mental?  The christmas tree is done.  My christmas bears are out.  The outside of the house is decorated in red and it is still snowing and sleeting.  And it's seriously cold outside.  Hey if I build a fire...  Will someone come and snuggle and drink cocoa with me?  Please?

       Costco and Me   Went to Baltimore today to see the grandparents and go shopping.  We had to go to Costco.  Big mistake.  Never allow me to buy in bulk ever again.  Who needs 8 cans of chicken meat that weigh like a pound per can.  Who needs 40 Capri Suns?  Who needs two super huge things of mustard?  Who needs a case of pomengranets?  Who needs anything in bulk except of a soup kitchen?  I guess I do.  Hope everyone is ready for more of this bullshit of weather we call "snow."  Keep warm and toasty.  P.S.  My scarf is so pretty...and Baby Girl's is baby blue...how cute?

       Mornin' y'all   Thought I would drop a note before heading out to work on why I haven't been posting:  I've been enthralled in the Lifetime's two-hour a night special of The Nanny.  Who could possibly resist that?  Watching The Nanny and knitting a scarf.  Yes I'm on the fast track to knitting myself and Baby Girl a scarf.  Yay me.  Write somemore later.  Oh...and expand a little more on your life Angelo...(i.e. age, major, foods, books...this would be the part where I'm requesting an email if you would be so kind.)  And you can always expect a response in return.  My email address is listed in the links.  Toodle caboodle.

       Kah...nitting   Yeah I'm a superstar now.  I figured out why I couldn't do the damn knit stitch...I wasn't casting right.  I was using the left handed people page instead of the right handed people page so it fucked everything up.  Now I can knit.  I'm knitting my rat "Baby Girl" a scarf.  I will have a matching one too...but of course.  Other than that I'm doing well...work is flying by....Christmas is close...but I still have insomnia.    P.S.  Tricia Calvin Klein's Eternity used to be my signature cologne but it made me feel a little attracted to myself.  I myself drool when I smell it on someone...on me it is just exceptionally fragrant and made many at the alphabet soup group drool.  Sharon used to say that it was sexier on me than anyone she had ever smelled it on before.  Go figure?

       I'll say it again...   I should seriously be a professional shopper.  Today I headed to Hagerstown, MD with my mother to the Valley Mall.  Big mistake.  List of things I bought for myself:  1.  2 Sterling silver rings 2.  A shirt from hot topic that has a baby on it that says "Damn You All." 3.  Cruxenchanter CD 4.  A Shady Unlimited Hoody 5.  A red cappacino mug 6.  Three pairs of pants 7.  A peacoat 8.  A Gucci hat 9.  Matching Gucci scarf (and no they are not knockoffs) 10. Knitting supplies (I've yet to learn the knit stitch but I can cast like a bitch) 11. The book "The Divinci Code." 12. A haircut  Christmas gifts...done....finally...if you don't like what I bought you tough shit...take it back...I'm done with it all.  So all together I spent about a grand this weekend between Christmas presents and myself presents.  Someone needs to fucking help me do the damn knit stitch so I can start this fucking scarf.  I'm heading to Aunt Velma's this weekend for a knitting lesson.  I am able to do like two knit stitches and then I wind up getting pissed off and fucking up.  So I'm going to finish crocheting my blanket and be happy I can at least do that.  But other than that I'm worn out and want to go take a long hot shower and go to bed.  Later y'all.    P.S.  Angelo you need to post more....it is so good for you.  And I made my mother buy a Louie Vuitton bag today...it is so cute.

       3:26am and I'm wide awake   Fell asleep on April and going to the movies.  Don't know what happened I just zonked out.  Sorry April.  Managed to sleep a couple of hours from like 8pm to 11pm.  Go me!  Now I've decided the internet is home for awhile.  No one except for Cyn really updated their blogs...come on people I need something to do here.    I think I'm going to watch some Buffy the Vampire Slayer collection!  "Hush" is my favorite episode with the Gentlemen.  So until I fall asleep again....hope everyone is resting well...  And I smell sexy for it being 3 in the morning.  This Hugo Boss stuff is yummy!  Not that Allure by Chanel wasn't or my Perry Ellis or Eternity.  I really need to have a signature fragrance.

       Snow White you Whore   So much for having a good weekend of shopping and la la la.  The la la la part is in reference to the evil doings that have yet to occur.  There is about 8 or so inches of snow outside...hmm 8 inches.  Yeah there is evil thought #1...turning something as pretty (annoying) as snow into a sexual thing.  But what am I to do with myself today.  Of course, I can bake more cookies which I really find there is no need to do because of the eight dozen that exploded out of the oven last night.  Or I could be courageous and play in the snow and try to make snow angels.  But they would probably turn out as snow satans since my luck with the divine hasn't been the greatest lately.  Or I could wait until a decent hour, call April, tell her we need to go shopping and hope that she wants to go.  If not Betsy the Benz is going to have a real good time of getting to Frederick with snow that probably sits higher than the body of the car.  She has low profile tires.  I feel shopping is the only thing to do besides going stir crazy.  Plus it makes me happy and all warm and fuzzy.  Speaking of warm and fuzzy I need to find someone that makes me feel that way of a semi-daily basis.  I won't be too hard on them.  Aside from the fact that even the ugliest of all creatures is being considered for my lover (yeah there is no ugly creature it's just a statement) I really need someone to at least get a little tongue action with.  I've made sure to take care of my lips and everything this winter.  I even told Cheryl at work on Friday that they were all warm and soft for kissing.  And they are.  They are way soft.  I expect the same in return.  Anyone want to just have a makeout could possibly lead to wild, passionate, animalistic sex meeting?  Applications now being accepted.  Went to Walmart last night.  I am throughly learning to hate Walmart, that is why I go there often. I saw Amanda and Billy's new baby.  I am in love with the little angel.  He is so adorable.  I want a baby so bad.  It's a shame men can't get pregnant.  I could just imagine the possibilites of clothing opportunities awaiting my newborn.  It's weird but everyone always tells me they can't see me as a father.  I saw "Whatevah" with a middle finger to ya because I am extremely good with children.  I only watched my cousin Keith and Destiny on end when I lived in Baltimore.  Plus I have spent countless hours entertaining Raina and Darien.  My child would be just like me.  However, what they wouldn't be is a child who was teased from age 7 until 17.  A child that had the shit kicked out of him.  Basically, a child living in a fantasy world just to escape the realities of his life with ignorant people.  My child would be accepting of everyone (except for the really icky people).  My child would not live in West Virginia.  If only I had a "my child."  April we need to get you pregnant with twins so I can have one.  Get to sluttin'.  Considering it's only 7:52am I'm sure there will be more to post later today so I'll shut up for now.  And after reading some of my previous posts I can tell I must have been high on pills or drunk.  Maybe my writing is getting better and more cohesive now that The Wizard of Oz finally gave me a brain.  But please let there be an offer when I cum back from wherever I find myself today.    And for those of you who think there should be marriage equality as I myself do please sign the following petition by clicking  urlLink here   Yeah it's 8:17am and I have more to say    After my toe had an intimate gathering with the foot of the desk I decided I'd stay on line just a little longer.  Why can't I find more people like  urlLink Angelo  in West Virginia?  Hmm?  I've spent the last half hour reading through his archieves now that they are fully available.  And I must say I'm in love with his writing.  Examples of what has made me giggle and wish he wrote books in the genre of "The Broken Diaries."  1.  While painting my mother's bathroom this afternoon, I had the most shocking revelation:  My mother is my ultimate faghag.  2.  I think I need to stop hanging out with heterosexuals.  3.  I felt as ordinary as a toaster today.  4.  I think I may have died and resurfaced in the innermost circles of hell.   5.  I hate skinny people who eat as if they had the stomach capacity of Rosie O'Donnell.  Yeah, that's right the last one just about made me want to end my life on a happy note.  Angelo my little ball of blogging sunshine where were you when I was in high school and college?     It's 6pm what the fuck are you doing...?   Just got in from shopping.  Managed to not buy one damn Christmas present for anyone but myself.  Let's see:  Missy Elliott's new cd No Doubt's greatest hits cd The Go-go's greatest hits cd A Hugo Boss cologne set with free Hugo Boss traveling bag, and some rock collection garden candle thing Apple, Berry, and Cucumber handwipes from Bath and Body Works Fresh Linen spray for my sheets and pillows...yummy. A shirt that has a tractortrailer on it that says "For a Good Time Call Your Mother." A shirt that has the saying "The People that think they know everything annoy the people like me that do."  Yeah Santa needn't bring any gifts for me this year.  And let's see if you have the opportunity listen to the Missy song about "Hair Weave." It is quite amusing.  Supposed to be going to the movies and out to a bar afterward tonight...it's quite icy out so we'll see what happens.  By the way...  THE GO-GO'S ROCK!!

       If I knew you were ah cummin'   I'd a baked a cake.  Instead I just baked eight dozen cookies.  Why you ask?  I have no idea.  Four dozen double peanut butter cookies, and four dozen chocolate pecan cookies.  Tomorrow is butterscotch cookies.  I feel like Martha Stewart without all the "I did some inside cookie trading" ordeal.  Anywho, I'm tired from all this baking so I'm going to watch Shrek.  Hey I can't help it I'm still intouch with my inner child.  Hope everyone is cozy and toasty that is getting hit with this fucking snow!  I had to call all over Ohio today to do updates for Summacare and the people were all types of chatty..."Is it snowing where you are?" "How much snow do you have?" "What color are your underwear and can I smell them."  What the hell is up with people's personalities when it comes to snow...it's not like you can get high off of it...it's not cocaine...  If it were I would have answered back "They are black Calvin Klein boxer briefs with a button fly.  Are you cute and horny?  If so, you can smell them."

       When Satan came to visit   Last night I had the weirdest dream.  I was in my bed and these two hands came out from the back of my bed.  They didn't try to strangle me or anything but they had really long talons/nails.  And I heard someone say "It's the hand of Satan."  So the hands start to scratch me and start with my wrists.  My mother walks into the room and cannot stop it from happening.  I wake up and I have scratch marks all over my wrists and arms.  And to make matters even weirder my dog Laquita who never sleeps in the bed with me she stays with my mother started whining when I woke up to get on the bed with me.  She slept the rest of the night in my bed.  I had fell back to sleep and started to dream this shit again and she started barking to wake me back up.    Is it just me or have I broken all ties with God?  Am I that evil that Satan feels slitting my wrists is plausable?  Should I have my room exorcised?    Mom said I must be the eviliest person because you don't hear of something like this everyday.    I'm seriously thinking about taking up a career as a nun just for safe measure.  Oh and the cool part is that you get to hit people with rulers when they are bad.  Yah...haa..haa.  Yeah I'm pretty much damned.  And Patrick you haven't went comatose or anything have you?  And just what does serotonin do?  Hope you are doing well in the guinea pig experiment.  Later ya'll I've got to go hang a cross above my bed just to be safe.

       Someone must have been a smartass   And put water in the sand of my timer.  Today went extremely slow.  To the point I was ready to end it all.  Minutes creeped by like hours...even decades.  Where is my suga' daddy or suga' mama?  Oh but where are you?  Take me away from all this work...make me your shopping slave.  After much consideration I think I want to be a professional shopper.  Time flies when you are having fun.    I really need a vacation.  I am supposed to go to Michigan to see Constance and Sarah in January if the weather is not too bad.  They found some bars I could potentially find my future spouse at.  I can't decide if I want to drive or fly?  Hmm?  I think I'll probably drive and take some pictures on the way up.  I have no clue where Kalamazoo Michigan is but in due time I shall learn.  Nothing much has happened in life.  Aside from playing Rummy with April and her mother the whole Thanksgiving vacation was a bust.  Although I must say my skills are improving at rummy.    And Regina, my friend from Germany had her baby a couple of days ago.  How exciting is that?  I'll post pictures later.  I have to upload them and I don't feel like it right now.  I wonder when she is coming back to WV?  Soon I hope.  And Amanda, my college buddy had her second baby, a boy named Ramee Momadoo (it's Islamic for Muhammad) on Saturday.  There are just babies popping up everywhere.    I want one damnit.    Night ya'll

       Written in Red   This morning on my way to work I was going down the very steep hill that leads to the bridge between WV and VA.  I was just drifting along.  No foot on any given pedal.  Wouldn't you know it...today is the day before the end of month quota for Mr/Mrs Policeman/woman.  I'm the proud owner of a brand new white/black and red Traffic Violation.  I was doing 61 in a 45.  Oops.  I honestly did not know.  I thought the speed limit was 55 at the top of the hill the limit is 60.  When the officer turned her lights on I was like oh shit something must be wrong with the car.  I had no clue that I was getting a speeding ticket.  The fine is $118.  I don't know about the points yet.  But I am going to fight it in court because I've been driving since I was 15 and this is the first time I've ever gotten a ticket.  You would have thought that she would have said "Look for being such a good driver (which I know is so not true) I will give you a warning but slow the fuck down...Okay."  No she had to give me the damn thing.  I think I would have gotten out of it if I hadn't pulled over in an inappropriate spot.  When you get over the bridges there is a road that leads up the side of the mountain that the people that live on the mountain use to get off the mountain to head to MD.  Well I pulled over there and made a big traffic back up.  I knew it wasn't appropriate but she kept on flashing her light and beeping her fucking atomic bullhorn thing.  So I didn't know what to do...I have never been pulled over before.  She tells me this is a really bad place for you to have pulled over.  I replied:  "Well you kept on flashing your lights and beeping that horn so I didn't know what to do.  If I would have kept on going up the road to the gas station you would have probably thought I was going to run from you.  So yeah I know it's not the best spot but I'm new at this."    She proceeded to ask for the license and registration.  Bitch!  I spent the day worrying about it but I'm okay with it because while I really didn't realize I was speeding if the radar said so then it must be true.  So I'll pay the fine but I'm going to court to make sure I don't get any points.  Aside from that after I got over the drama of the morning I did absolutely nothing at work.  I had the motivation of a paperclip or piece of tape.  I just hung around.  I tried my damndest to be productive but I figured "Hey everyone has days where they just don't want to work."  So I did exactly that...didn't work.  I danced, tried to do the moonwalk, sang, tried my talent at beat boxing with Cheryl (it was pretty much me spitting), and doodled on pieces of paper until it was time for me to run the daily reports.  Oh yeah and I talked to my mother, my father, April, my Aunt Ganda, and my friend Cheri.  Work should be this productive personally everyday.  I mean I did do my part yesterday and save the company $3000 for a hospital putting in fraudulent claims.  I just need to get a phone number to enter the information and there you go...money in their pockets.  Calling people has proven to be more enjoyable than I thought it would be.  Not that I like talking to these people but the messages that some of these people leave on their answering machines.  Here are two examples I have written down to share with you.  Remember these are actual messages.  Would you leave a message to any of these?  "No one can tell you so you was.  No one can tell me who I am.  No one can tell me I was failure for I am so I say I was and am and only God and tell me who I am.  No one but you and God can determine who you was and who I was.  So remember that and know who you baby's daddy is.  Thanks for calling and if I want I will call you back."  Hello fucking speaking properly much?  "Who da fuck do you thing you are ni**a?  Who you was with...who was it that you was fucking.  You ain't nevah been no baby's daddy to our baby.  Listen mothafucka if you call here one more time ni**a I'll fucking kill dis baby daddy drama."  Is someone bitter here?  Sorry for the use of the n word but that is what she said so can't help that much.  Tomorrow night Cheri, Michael and I are supposed to go to D.C. I get to meet Michael finally.  Wish me luck that I get some compensation in the "lucky" department.  At least a fucking kiss...shit.

       If tomorrow never came   When you are at work do you ever think to youself (and I know you do) "God I wish this day would end?"  What a stupid thought.  Think about it.  When the day ends it just starts a new day at work unless it's Friday.  Sometimes I wish tomorrow would never come.  Not that I'm talking about death but think of the day or a day when you were extremely happy...so elated that you could burst.  Imagine if that day just lagged on for a little longer.  Imagine if you could stretch time out just for a little longer.  Would you even do it?  I would.  On those days when I feel like "life cannot get any better than this."  Take for instance when Desi and I were in Hawaii on Waikiki Beach for the first time.  The morning sunrise leading to the evening sunset.  I was far away from home and yet being there was like home.  I would love to have been able to stretch that day even if just for a few more hours.  But I've got to realize that it just can't be done.  I don't even think when I was Wiccan that I ran across a spell for time stretching.  I would love to know why I think of ideas like this?  I wonder sometimes if people actually think as I do.  If their minds race at night with thoughts and ideas that even scare them.  I think I should have majored in Philosophy or Writing.  I mean yeah writing in my journal I could care less about punctuation, spelling, grammar and all that mess but my Professor for English 101 told me that I would be an excellent fictional writer.  I've always been told that by teachers/professors.  Is it because I crave that which can never be had...the life of an imaginary character?  Or my sense of living through other people's thoughts and actions?  I don't know.  Even though my mind scares me sometimes I still enjoy my voyages to other plains.  God this is going to sound like I mind travel to other planets and shit but what I'm talking about is the higher level you reach when you aren't just thinking because you have to.  The place your mind forces you to go when it makes you think.  Maybe I should really consider that brain scan afterall?

          So...umm...let us see.  I had to give Prissy away tonight.  It was a better thing for her to go with my friend Amanda where she could be around other dogs that wouldn't try to kill her.  My dog Lucky would have no part of her.  She tried to attack her every chance she got.  It wasn't fair to keep her in separate rooms when all she wanted to do was play with a dog that just wouldn't let her.  Aside from that the stress of raising her was too much.  My parents were getting agitated and I could tell.  It was wearing them out especially my mother.  Aside from that I thought today about how I just can't see myself giving anything to this animal.  My schedule doesn't allow me much time.  I was so worn out from it all and it had only been a week.  But I've realized that while I will miss coming home to her greeting me at the door that she is so better off with Amanda and Billy and Raina and Raimee (I hope I spelled his name right).  But then on the way home from Amanda's I got to thinking which I always do.  If I can't give my love and attention fully to an animal what makes me think that I could in a relationship?  Am I as greedy and self-absorbed as a lot of people tell me I am in their joking manner?  Or am I just to independent and used to routine to settle down?  I can go and come when I please and wether it be a dog or relationship can I actually tolerate having to be committed to something?  Who the fuck knows.  Maybe later down the road I'll figure this out.  It just scares me that I can't even commit myself to raising a dog.  Damn it...so I've fucked things up again as I always seem to do.  Fuck.

       And then there was   A thing I remembered called sleep.  A thing called grass.  A sun.  A not so fucking snow/ice covered day.  Today the weather is depressing to look at.  All the white I feel like I'm in a bad version of J.LO's dressing room...shit.  Talked to Ralphy last night for eh...8 and 1/2 hours.  So yes I'm tired.  Yes I should have gotten off the computer earlier.  And yes I'm ready for bed.  But...  Seeing that I have a 7 week old puppy to tend to I don't see a black haze over my eyes for quite sometime.  Hope everyone that has all this snow is keeping warm and toasty!!

       30 Minutes   Mama, Papa Forgive me   Out of sight Out of mind Out of time To decide  Do we run? Should I hide? For the rest Of my life  Can we fly? Do I stay? We could lose We could fail  In the moment  It takes To make plans Or mistakes  30 minutes, a blink of an eye 30 minutes,to alter our lives 30 minutes,to make up my mind 30 minutes,to finally decide  30 minutes,to whisper your name 30 minutes,to shoulder the blame 30 minutes,of bliss, thirty lies 30 minutes,to finally decide  Carousels  In the sky That we shape With our eyes  Under shade Silhouettes Casting shade Crying rain  Can we fly? Do I stay? We could lose We could fail  Either way Options change Chances fail Trains derail  30 minutes, a blink of an eye 30 minutes,to alter our lives 30 minutes,to make up my mind 30 minutes,to finally decide  30 minutes,to whisper your name 30 minutes,to shoulder the blame 30 minutes,of bliss, thirty lies 30 minutes,to finally decide  To decide  To decide, to decide, to decide  To decide  To decide, to decide, to decide  To decide  When I look at the world I see so much beauty and wonder where do I fit into all of this?  Am I the square to the circle?  Am I the piece of the puzzle that just doesn't fit?  I want so much just to be happy.  Have you ever thought of being happy so much that it drives you to the point of sadness?  The type of sadness that you know may never leave?  I'm just so fucking frustrated.  There just isn't enough for me to classify myself as happy yet.  Or am I happy and I just don't know it?  And what exactly classifies one as being happy?  You can cry and be happy, laugh and be sad or just be and that is all.  I sound like a fucking depressed psycho but my mind just races with thoughts and questions.  So many questions that will have to wait to be answered.  So many questions that don't have answers.  If you peeled away all that was me I think there would just be a void.  It's my missing piece to the puzzle...it's my eternal longing to have and be had by someone.  I appreciate everyone's advice so very much but I just need someone, a twin to talk to that understands my thoughts and how erratic they are.  I find myself looking for answers within myself and sometimes I find them.  I want to go back.  Relive everything so that I understand myself more.  If I would have just been myself these 23 years I think I would be a hell of a lot more mentally stable.  But that can't be done and I'll have to grow.  Come what may...hopefully it brings understanding.

       Rule of thumb   Never think anything is easy to do.  Especially raising a 7wk old puppy.  While she has lots of energy and love she is a handful.  I've been so consumed with her that I haven't done much of anything else.  I haven't talked online to anyone (Ralphy) or even called anyone to see what's up.  So a big I'm sorry to those of you who I've been neglecting.  Last night I made the mistake of letting Prissy go to sleep by 9pm and we were up by 5am.  Plus the fact that we slept all day because my sinus' are still a mess and I'm just not feeling too well.  Other than that I do enjoy having Prissy with me.  I need to learn how to let her stay alone for a while like in another room so she doesn't get too attached to me.  It breaks my heart to hear her yelp or cry but she stops in a matter of like 10 mins.  Mom said I have to do this so when I'm at work she isn't going crazy looking for me.  So I'm hoping that Ralphy will be online tonight and Prissy will let me talk to him for a while.    If not there's always tomorrow.

       A combination platter please....   I'm tired today.  Prissy has worn me out.  She has the energy of 50 horny men at an orgy.  She just wants to keep coming and going and coming and going!!  LOL.  But I love her.  She is great.  It's snowing now so plans for this weekend are ruined.  Doesn't look like I'll be meeting Michael anytime soon.  Damn it.  I really want to meet someone.  Not just someone to hookup with but just someone that at least by the end of the night there is a kiss and the holding of hands shared.  Does anyone have any friends that would be interested that aren't psycho killers?  I'd love to meet Rafael because this whole talking thing is getting harder and harder for me to resist not to ride down to Alabama and break the taking it slow rule.  If I knew that Patrick could be interested in my I'd drive to Cleveland to meet him.  He seems like a truly fascinating person and the fact that he has a great sense of humor makes him that more attractive.  So Patrick if you read this and you still want to get married I'm still ready for ya...LOL.  No seriously I really want to meet someone that is a combination of Patrick and Rafael.  I love reading Patrick's journal for the humor and of course I just like talking to Rafael.    I don't know how much longer I can be self tolerant to not find some random slut to sleep with (note:  I have only been with one person so I'm no hoe).  I've been wanting affection for some time now and I'm really wanting it bad tonight.  I mean just a talk leading to a kiss and hold hands and cuddling.  If it should go further than that's cool.  God what am I going to do with myself?  Ugh...frustration sucks dick!!!!!!!!!!

       Advice...   So my mother and I are looking into the advice given by Bill and Patrick about PFLAG.  I read most of the site yesterday.  The closest chapter is in Baltimore.  And though it may seem like I'm condemning myself for my lifestyle I'm not.  The burning in the hell part is just saying if that's what people think will happen to me then I'll do it to live the way I want.  I'm very proud of who I am.  I denied myself the luxury of me for so long I forgot what it was like to be me so I'm living everyday to its fullest and without regret.  It amazes me so much that people that I have never met take the time to read my blog and offer their advice.  I am truly blessed and greatful for the people that have entered into my life.  Without them I think that this ordeal would be so much that more harder to deal with.  I can't express enough to Patrick, Bill, Tricia, Samantha, Barb, Joyce, Aunt Ganda, and everyone else that has been there to support me how much I appreciate the love and support they are showing me.  I know that many people who know me knew before I admitted it that I was the person I truly am and I thank them for never presurring me to "come out."  I've come to realize that the people around me both in real life and online are my support and that if I just open up myself to the possibilities of listening and sharing myself with them that my life will become easier each day.  While I'm sure that there will be more obstacles in the future I know that if I keep my online and "in person" friends that I will be able to be victorious over these events when they come.  So from the bottom of my heart to all of you and you all know who you are I am truly honored that you take the time to support me and continually show your love even if we have never met.  To all of you I wish the best in life because you deserve it for being so wonderful to a person that many of you have never met...if I had the money I'd take care of each of you for the rest of your life.  Pray that I hit the lottery...and it will be done.  Here is another pic of Prissy...it's her debut mugshot:

       The Email   Paul,  I just want to say I LOVE YOU no matter what.  However, please try to keep in mind your fathers feelings regarding all this.   I know that you and your father have never seen eye to eye and most likely will never.    I hope that you have respect enough to try to handle things with him different then you do me.    Your father LOVES you to no end, but I really think he could never handle any of this.  I beleive in the back of his mind he may think something, but will never admit it nor could never accept it and to no fault of his own.  Your Dad along the way somehow lost his open mind and why I do not know and I know for a fact this would destory him.  He thinks highly of you and has always wanted the best he could give to you.   So, PLEASE, try to treat him with a little more respect and understanding keeping in the back of you mind how much he LOVES YOU and wants the best for you.   I know you have been dealing with this along time and sorry you have to.   I also know that dealing with this moving forward it even going to be harder with the fact of your father verses me.    I do not want this to  destory our family, because if there is one thing I believe in it is family and no matter how hard you or I would try, I believe this would never fly with your Dad.  Please do not hold this against him, he is only trying to protect you and in his mind he was taught that this is not right according to the persons he looked up to as well as other avenues of teaching. Just be Happy, but try to keep me and your father in your life.  LOVE YA.... MOM.  P.S.  Keep an open mind to ladies, I would like to have grandchildren and a daughter in law one day if possible.    HA! HA!  This is the email that I got from my mother today at work.  What followed was me smoking about 500 cigarettes and crying.  She says in the email that she just wants me to be happy but deep down I know inside she will never be able to accept me being "different."  I think she will tolerate it but never fully be able to grasp it.  She will infact never condone it.  I'd sell my soul to not have to be this way because it is not easy.  I wish that for one day everyone knew what it was like to have feelings for both men and women.  I am making no apologies for who I am.  I am who I am and that is the way that it will always be.  If I have to burn in hell just to love then so be it.    We just got finished talking and she said that she really just wants me to be happy.  She says she doesn't understand if she did something wrong when I was a child.  She and my father did nothing wrong.  You just know who you are attracted to and you live with it.  While I will never be able to tell my father about my "secret" I'll have to live life as I always have...keeping parts of me hidden...and if that is the man at my side and he makes me happy I'll be just as happy having my secret lover.  So the whole point is that I will live my life no matter what the fuck anyone thinks.  If you don't approve you don't have to be in my life.  If you love me no matter who I am then let's party.

       I have the luck of...   A shattered mirror that crossed black cats path while under a ladder.  So last night I was supposed to go to D.C. with Cheri and hopefully meet Michael.  What happens?  Ice/Snow/Sleet.  It's not like it was a huge storm or anything but it did enough damage to make going anywhere a risk.  I did manage to go to April's and sit at the bonfire.  April, Adam and April's toasted Mom was there.  I love April's Mom.  She makes me laugh my ass off.  So last night was a bust.  Hopefully things will work out to go out next weekend.  But I did talk to Rafael yesterday for about 4.5 hrs in the afternoon and about another 2 hours last night.  I'm starting to feel that I'm not the only putting time into this.  I'm not getting my hopes up too much talking to him.  I mean yeah we have exchanged phone numbers but we are just not ready to take the next step.  Plus when you are talking on line it takes more effort to keep the conversation going because there is no voice to hear or body to see.  Yeah I'm "falling" for him but I still know that I shouldn't give my heart away so fast so I'm good with taking it slow.  And I found out last night that Birmingham, AL is only 9-10 hours away from here so he's not that far away.  Anyway...I need to stop running my mouth...the butterflies are overwhelming...  Everyone have a good day!!

       Awkward   Last night I went out with Cheri and a group of her friends to Manassas to a place called "Sharp Shooters."  Why the title of awkward?  Well Cheri has a friend named Michael.  Cheri is trying to play faghag matchmaker.  We are at Cheri's room last night and Michael calls to see what she is doing.  She tells him that we are going to go out and asks if he wants to come but he is sick so he can't.  So I'm sitting there like "Please Cheri don't say hey Michael...Paul is here I want you two to talk to each other."  What does she do two seconds later?  My nightmare came true.  Now you must understand that I am very shy when it comes to talking to people I don't know especially over the phone...unless I'm at work because shit that's just a job.  So anyway, we are both on the phone and I'm nervous as hell as too is he.  The first five minutes were like "I don't know what the hell to say.  We are going to kill Cheri."  After the initial ice broke we wound up talking for another hour and 10 minutes before we had to leave.  I had asked Cheri what he said to her after we got off the phone with each other and he had said "Cheri why the hell did you do that to us?  Now I'm feeling all awkward."  When Cheri told me this I was like shit blew this one.  But then she says and then he said "Your friend Paul sounds really nice.  I'd like to meet him."  It's about time that my mouth aside from getting me in trouble is taking me places.  So tonight if Michael is feeling better (sinus infection...I'm sympathize greatly) we are all going out to a strip club called "Wet" in D.C.  If he however, is not feeling better and the weather is supposed to be bad we are driving to Kaiser to see him.  I told him that I would make him some fresh chicken noodle soup if Cheri and I came up.  So I'm hoping for going to D.C. with Cheri, Michael and Tiffany.  But either way I'd like to meet him.  Wish me luck!!

       Happy   Today I woke up with a smile and butterflies.  It could have been the lack of sleep considering I was chatting with Ralphy until 3am.  I may have just imagined the whole thing.  But I'd like to think that I didn't.  My current status is "Fallen."  My current music pick "Fallen" by Sarah Maclachlan.  I'll write more later I've got to get ready to meet April.  Shopping day.

       Suck me dry...   I thinking that Lipo isn't all that bad an idea.  Exercising sucks ass.  Well if you do all those stupid exercises like Richard Simmons.  But if you decide that your exercise is dancing alone for 45-60 mins then it isn't that bad.  Preceeded by stretching and the followed by 150 sits ups and weight lifting.  Now this part isn't too wonderful but I don't mind it.  So tonight I did my 150 situps and probably looked like a complete idiot dancing by myself for an hour but hey no one was around.  The fact that I can "shake ass" has its pluses.  I should totally be on Soul Train.  I would show those people a few things or two.  I am pretty wore out from all this I must say.  But it will be repeated tomorrow...the weekends are mine though to relax.  I figure that M-F can be the work out everynight plan.    I smell like a pig covered in it's own shit so I'm going to get off of here for right now until later when Ralphy is on.  So have a good night ya'll.  Cheers

       Through the looking glass   When I look in the mirror all I see is a reflection of a person confused, angry and lifeless.  I am that which I have feared.  Lost.  I am who I am but I feel that there is more in the world for me.  There is so much more for me to experience, touch, see, taste and love but sometimes I wonder if I will ever get the opportunity to make such dreams come true.    I am alone.  I am lonely.  I want for there to be more in my life.  Sometimes I crave the life of others just to know what it is like to live.  Yes I live but do I really "live?"  I feel like my life is at a standstill.  It has gone stagnent.  I want to make this now tattered cloth into a kite that flies freely.  I want to breathe new life into myself.  I want change.    More importantly I want love.  I want the type of love that lasts for all eternity.  I want a love that fills my body so that only it is what I need to live, to breathe.  I want a love that cries rivers of sadness but at the same time brings the one joy from the hundred griefs it has caused.  I want love to redeem me.  I want that which has betrayed me before.    I just want peace.

       Who named it? and Why?   Someone tried to send me a Trojan Horse virus.  I know the whole story about Helen of Troy and the Trojan Horse and how it can apply to this virus but I'd like to think that the virus is more fantastical than that.  If possible.  So my opinion...which surely doesn't mean shit is that:  A.  Ron Jeremy named it. B.  Reason being:  Because the virus just slips in and slips out.  Aside from my new theory on the Trojan virus I look like a total "nerd" today.  Let's see...no contacts...glasses.  Jeans, a Banna Republic Shirt, CK fleece, and sandals.  It's only 31 degrees out.  I didn't do my hair.  I think this comes from the total lack of inspiration I felt this morning for trying to even put and outfit together.  Plus the fact that I didn't sleep well last night.  I'm thinking that I need to hire a team to take care of me in the morning.  I want to feel like J-Lo except that I wouldn't have fake hair put in everyday.  Maybe every other day...  Well I'm off to watch "Uptown Girls."  I hope it is okay because Brittney Murphy has some issues and I'm thinking I may have to tell her about herself.  Patrick  If I could give you a hug and a kiss right now I would.  I wouldn't slip you the tongue that would be taking it too far.  Thank you for the comments.  Pattykins  I knew you knew but with the alphabet group some things are better left unsaid. I'll stop by and see you soon.  Samantha  You provide such excellent advice all the time and I am truly greatful for that.  I love the doll site.

       The barrier I once held is slowly fading   Loving someone is never easy.  Especially when you are the person that is devoted to that person but their feelings aren't intense as your own.  Summer who many of you know from my past was that one girl that I was insanely "in love" with.  This was not puppy love or lust it was the kind of love where you would bleed yourself dry for the person.  Needless to say it never worked out and from that point on I told myself that I would never allow myself to love like that again.  I put a barrier around my heart/emotions.  I've let it stay there for years now.  I have never looked for anyone because I was afraid of what could happen again and the thought of it and the pain I went through with Summer made the wall that enclosed my heart grow stronger and stronger everyday.  However, I am now starting to let myself love or at least acknowledge the notion of love again.  I am so just "head over heels" right now I don't know what to do with myself.  I find myself constantly thinking about Rafael.  Yeah yeah yeah...he is a guy but I have separated myself from loving for so long I don't care if the person were half man and half woman that I'm not worried about being with or living an alternate lifestyle.  I saw this happen with Constance and she is happier than she has ever been.  So from the above paragraph you can tell that there must be something special about Rafael and there is.  He and I talk for hours on AIM and time just stands still when I'm talking to him.  I cannot get enough.  I even try to chat with him at work if he is online on my phone.  Yes there is the notion of the physical attraction but more over the conversation out weighs all of the physicality of the situation.  I'm just hoping that he will feel the same way in the long run.  I know I'm not the most attractive person and that he isn't 100% attracted to me but I'm hoping that the inner person is what will make him feel as I do.  Actually I'm not sure how he really feels...he has told me that he does enjoy very much talking with me and that we will sometime from now start talking over the phone.  Neither of us is ready for talking over the phone yet.  Also he told me that if things work out as they are now he wouldn't mind me coming to see him at UAB (University of Alabama) in four months or so.  I'm so proud of myself for finally starting to be the person I've always known I've been since I was 10.  I am letting it be known that yes I am attracted to men and women and that's just me.  I have no control over how God made me and I think deep down inside God just wants us to be happy and at the present time Rafael is filling that void I had in my life.  Pray for me that things will work out and I'll finally have someone to call my own.  Love ya'll...is it that obvious that I'm falling?

       For the love of meat...not that kind...the animal kind...dirty bastards   What is it with people not thinking that chicken and pork is not in the category of "meat."  The other white?  And why do so many individuals thinks that eggs are not animals?  Hello can we say chicken abortion!  That's what I thought.  I'm doing quite well with the "giving up on the meat" thing.  I'm back to my old ways when I was a veggie-tarian.  I don't even crave it.  The whole "giving up the soda" thing has only caught me yearning/lusting for a Pepsi yesterday.  But I was victorious and resisted.  Blah...blah...blah...I'm going to be so fucking hot my summer I'll need a air conditioner shoved up my ass to keep the sizzle down.  So far 27 lbs. lost.  Whooo hooo...go me!  At work today I busted ass to get shit done.  It has been a long time since I've actually "worked" or "been productive" at work.  I mean what is the whole point of going to work if you are going to "work?"  There is none.  I prefer to talk, file/buff my nails, listen to music and pray that tomorrow I am still employeed.  I should be my own business owner...it would be great and fresh.  It is cold outside around the teens or something.  I think I may have become allergic to the therometer.  When it gets lower than 60 I start to cough and wish I were dead.  I cannot wait until spring.  I'm planning on inventing the world's first "heater" to further global warming so that at least stepping outside can be for a moment enjoyable not torture.  Night ya'll

       I'm lazy so if you visit  urlLink Cyn's Page  you will see the same entry   Moronic Tales I consider my family to be well educated...on my mother's side. Now my aunts, uncles and so on may not have college degrees however, they all offer something to the conversation or a specific topic...again on my mother's side. Now my father's side of the family...hmmm? I can't say for certain but if a catscan was done the doctor's would probably discover missing brain or the whole damn thing missing...maybe not even a brainstem. Why am I talking about the family in such a tone? Here are two questions my 56 Aunt asked...one tonight...one when her mother passed away:  1. "Paul, where exactly is your hip located? Is it attacted to the leg?"  2. Situation: The nurse had told my Aunt that her mother had went to rest (i.e. she was in the hospital for 3 months with bone cancer...rest=death). My Aunt proceeds to ask the nurse, "So when did she fall asleep?"  My mission in life is now to educate my father's side of the family in hopes that they can be released into the world without too many fuck-ups. Is it wrong of me to question the knowledge of this side of the family after hearing this shit? I think not.  P.S. Hoping Cyn is feeling well and that lots of vicodin are headed her way.

       NBK   Natural Born Killers.  Last night at Amanda's house.  Until 4:23am.  Never had seen this movie before.  It was quite different and interesting.  I will watch it again, but I'd prefer to be on acid at the time of viewing.    When I finally made it home around 5 this morning I couldn't sleep so I managed to watch the first 45 mins of  urlLink Underworld .  God love the DVD.  God love Kate Beckensale and Scott Speedman.  God love threesomes.  Anyway, I finally managed to fall asleep.  Now I'm awake and it is only 11:19am.  I'm still a little tired but I'm guessing it will pass.    So if something interesting happens today or when I get online tonight to talk to Ralphy I'll post more.  Until then I'm going to finish  urlLink Underworld  and relax.

       For fuck's sake   I took off today in hopes that I would sleep in and just relax for the day.  Well it didn't happen as you can tell.  I have been up since 6am.  No more sleepy sleepy.  I'm really not tired however, my headache has traveled long distances to stay with me from last night.  Nothing has taken it away yet.  It's quite annoying.  If I had some herb I'd probably smoke it.  That usually takes care of a headache anyway.  Where is a drug dealer when you need him/her?  The whole "giving up meat" thing is going well.  I really haven't even had a craving for it.  Mom brought home chicken tenders last night that I absolutely love with tabasco sauce and it didn't even phase me.  I think everyone should try giving up meat once in their life.  It really isn't that hard.  Now me giving up soda at the same time is probably what is causing the headache.  Caffeinee headaches are the worst.  My headache last night left me having to get offline with Rafael.  But when you have already chatted for 2 1/2 hours it's pretty safe to say you didn't blow them off.  I have no clue how I have managed to talk so long to one person.  I mean it is ridiculous 4 hrs here, 3 hrs there.  Thank god I don't get charged for each message sent.    But I do enjoy conversing with him.    I'll have a picture of the new tattoo later today.  I must say it is my favorite out of all of them.  Yes it even shines above the "In Memory of Aaliyah" I have.  That one is more personal.  In case you have forgotten here is the list of tats:  1.  Left ankle=Chinese symbol for spirit with a ring of water around it 2.  Left calf=William Blake quote (newest) 3.  Left foot=the OM symbol 4.  Right Ankle=2 Celtic symbols for eternity with scroll work making a band 5.  Neck=Chinese symbol for Heaven 6.  Left upper arm=Chinese symbol for wind with "In Memory of Aaliyah" around it with a tear drop 7.  Right upper arm=Sun/moon with the moon sticking its tongue out 8.  Wrist=Symbol for Gemini  I just can't wait to get another one.  I plan on having my whole left calf covered by the time it's done and over with.  That's when I'll stop getting them.  Any suggestions for the next tattoo?

       You make me want to...   Fucking scream at the top of my lungs.  Who could this person be?  Hmmm.  My supervisor J.  Jesus Christ man give spying on people a break.  Everytime you are doing something crazy (i.e. the cabbage-patch, the running man, the roger rabbit, droppin it to the floor) there his ass is.  But if you need to see him to have him do something for you he is MIA.  And aside from him being grotesquely Peppy Lepewish (black hair, grey line running down the middle...serious here) he has the humor of a bundt cake.  Although a bundt cake tastes good.  I really need to form my plan for world domination now...or it will never do anything to help humanity of people so colorless as him.  Ugh.  I have officially become a veggie-tarian again.  No animal in this body.  I have done very well today.  I had my Snapple tea this morning and water the rest of the day.  A rice cripsy treat, a garden salad, and some brocolli and cheddar soup.  Yay me.  See I'm planning on get my "rock hard body" on by this spring.  So I'm finally fed up with being Mr. McPlumpy.  Last time I was a vegetarian I lost 25 lbs in a month.  Hopefully history has learned to repeat itself in this instance.  Once again the fingernails are long again.  Have I cut them....NO!  But I did file and buff them today at work.  I'm the cliche of the "California Receptionist."  Thinking about getting a new tattoo Friday.  I took the day off so I'm calling to make an appointment tomorrow.  I'm thinking I may have the eye of Horus put on the right foot.  Haven't decided yet.  Picture will come if the tattoo occurs.  Well I'm off to relax for awhile.  Tomorrow I'm buying Underworld because I can and because that movie makes vampires sexier than...   You in a hot nighty covered in chocolate...and yes I mean all of you!

       Three more days   And I won't be sitting at my desk looking at the computer like this:      Yes that is me contemplating if work or suicide is the answer.  Question:  Am I really that unattractive?   My adopted family   I am learning to like myself more these days.  I'm not hiding myself so much anymore.  Well I'm hiding some things from certain people that don't need to know certain things but they are not bad things.  Well yeah it would probably crush the father but hey.  My online family has helped me deal with things so well.  And even my Aunt's for being so accepting of my alternate lifestyle gives me hope that I can just be me without any consequences.  So what if I dig guys and girls.  It's no one elses business but my own and really only effects me in the long run.  Chatting with R.  I'll end the suspense...Rafael has been quite enjoyable over the past few days.  He is very interesting and makes my day close on the good side.  If you read this Rafael big ups to you.  Plus to say he is gorgeous...I have pictures but I have to resize them for the site.  Aunt's if you read this information please don't run and tell mother...I know you won't anyway you never have.  Mom says she doesn't like the fact that I dip in both pools because "The Bible" says it's wrong...yada yada yada.  But deep down she wants me to be happy.  So through just learning to deal with me and having the support of my online family I am in a current state of being content.  Except for the whole having to go to work thing.  Hugs and kisses sent out to you all:  Tricia Samantha Aunt Ganda Aunt Velma April Amanda Erin(you will get a response when I figure out what I want to say) Patrick Rafael Faustus Cyn Phil David Tink Sarah Angelo And whoever else I can't think of at the moment.

       Have I ever...   Wanted to sit at my desk with my lips pressed together and fun my finger over them making that ridiculous sound?  But of course.  Work proved to be more of a pain than a pleasure today.  But hey I've got to make a living somehow.  Prostitution and crack dealing are becoming more and more appealing these days.  Umm...hmm.  Bumsheeka is doing well.  She stays in my Hugo Boss duffle bag for most of her boring life.  But she does see the light of night every now and again when I'm in need of being motherly and entertainment.  I think I may have to knit her a scarf as well.  And speaking of scarves I spilled pineapple juice on Baby Girl's so now it is sure to be eaten.  I have to start a new one sometime soon or she will never have anything to wear to the Winter Formal I am throwing for her.  What to do...what to do.  I must say that I enjoy guest blogging.  I actually got comments from two people.  Who'd of thunk it?  Not I.  I thought that my entries would have just went unnoticed but alas they have not.  Ya..ha..ha.   I really want to design my own background.  I tired of the drabness that the templates bring.  I want something that screams "Barney's" or "Gitchee gitchee la da da da...creole lady Marmalade."  Whichever will work.  Well I'm off to talk to R.  Oooh..the suspense.  I find R. quite interesting.

       Long time no talk...   Left for Baltimore on Wednesday after work.  I was supposed to go to a New Years party as Stacy's house.  However, seeing that Tuesday night I only slep for an hour and 20 minutes it didn't happen.  Other than that I watched the ball drop and crashed.  Did nothing on Thursday except watch Buffy and listen to the grandmother ramble.  Went shopping on Friday and Saturday.  Two days of shopping and now I'm wore out.  My grandmother, like me is good at shopping.  I think that we need to have it classified as an Olympic event.  So now I'm home.  I need to unpack.  I need to take a shower and eat seeing that I haven't ate today and took a shower last night.  I think tonight screams:   Crawl into bed with some Oatmeal cookies..pop in HUSH (4th season Buffy) and chill..maybe read a little and if the moment grabs you crochet more to your blanket and maybe knit a little...aww...   So anywho, since I don't have much to say and I'm guest blogging at  urlLink Cyn's  and I have to have something to write there I'm off.  I mean come on how can my writing and life compare to the working of Cyn's.  Something fantastic has to happen soon so I have something to write about tomorrow.

       50 years and counting   My grandparents 50th wedding anniversary party was today.  It was so good to see them.  However, I'm realized today that I will never be part of this family aside from me loving my grandparents unconditionally.  I don't want to be part of this family aside from that.  As presents were being given out and opened by my grandparents everyone started talking about "Josh" my Aunt's ex-boyfriends son who is gay.  Well they couldn't just ask how he was doing since we haven't seen him in ages instead all you hear is "fag" and "faggot".  And people start impersonating the stereotypical comedic gay male.  I sat there wanting to cry because deep down I'm thinking and you all don't know at this moment that you are amongst that which you laugh at.  I got up, got my phone, went to the car, called Cheri and April and cried.  I don't want to be part of a family where even though I know my Aunt Ganda and Aunt Velma love me...that I will never be accepted in.  I could never tell anyone else about this.  It is my secret part of my life...it is me...and those who will never accept it will never know the real "Paul."  But anyway, going to the movies.  Here are two pictures I took of myself today because I was bored and tried to speak as little as possible to the family.  Aunt G and Aunt V I love you with all my heart and this has nothing to do with you it is the rest of the fucking ignorant family.  And last you will no longer see me at family functions.  This is my last one for the sanity in me.  Everyone enjoy the picture.  I hope I'm not frightening!!  LOL      What is it with 3am blogging?   Just got home from Cheri's apartment.  She is my angel.  She makes me feel so much better when earlier I felt like a total outcast of society.  I love my Cheri to death.    Talking to Ralphy right now.  God how I have missed talking to him and he the same.    I feel better but I'm over the whole "being part of a family."  I thinking of myself more as an "orphan" at this point.  Night everyone!!  P.S. Happy Birthday to  urlLink Patrick  ...the sexy comedian of my dreams!!  LOL

       OH MY DAWG   So has anyone else out there in blogworld ever had a dog that licks walls?  Seriously.  Licks walls.  My dog Lucky aka "LaQuita" tends to lick walls out of the blue.  Is something wrong here or should I have not fed her those Frosted Paint Flakes when she was a puppy.  Last night Cheri informed me that Michael thinks I am very sweet.  How did she put it..."Michael said you are such a sweet guy.  He can't believe you wrote him a "Just Because." He really liked it and said he will never lose it."  I am so in the field for victory now.  Michael said I was sweet...that's enough to lift my spirits for a couple of days.  Anywho, if you don't know what a "Just Because" is it is a poem that reflects on a person's outer and inner beauty.  I don't think that people are told enough how good looking or how great their personalities are so I do this for very few people.  So far I've only written one for Cheri, Michael and Rafael.  The one to Summer is the "Just Because" of how she broke my heart...bitch.  Anyway.  Since Michael had to work third shift this week I don't think we will be doing anything exciting.  I told Cheri maybe we could all catch a movie or play cards or something.  Just a chill weekend.  God I so need Cheri around so I don't crawl in my little shy shell.  She and Angel say that I bring out the bad in Asian women...but I believe they bring out the "superstar" in me.  Hope everyone is doing well...have a good night...I bought "The Missing" and I'm just dying to watch it...not really but you know I sometimes have to exaggerate.    Night all my bloggie boys and girls!!

       Standing Ovariation   Aside from not falling asleep as I so desperately wanted to do at work today I had a conversation about the female reproductive system.  Has anyone ever noticed that it sort of resembles a "moose head" when it is drawn in textbooks?  Am I crazy or are women harboring "moose heads" but we call them vaginas?  Here moosey moosey...want a carrot?  I infact have too much time on my hands.  If you add water to the "moose head" will it be like a chia pet and sprout foliage?  Oh the endless questions that I have with the female vagina...as opposed to the male vagina.  Today was a pretty good day except for the whole "I'm feening" episode.  But I'm proud of myself for I did not try to score anything.  Those days I have told myself are over.  It has been a long time since I've gotten high off of pills and I truly don't need them.  It just comes up every once and awhile.  It's sort of like the recovered alcoholic feening for a beer a year later.  So in conclusion to this story I'm happy to say that while my brain was telling me "You need vicodin" the Pop-up Conscience Angel told me "Get over it."  And I did.  Yay me.    And I cannot express to my readers how much I am considering William Hung my American Idol.  I only watched the first three episodes.  But he is wonderful and the reason behind this is that when he went to a professional voice technician or whatever they are called he improved his version of "She Bangs."  But it doesn't stop there...he sung "Can You Feel The Love Tonight."  And what makes it even better he added a little zest to it...what do I mean...read below:  The correct line in the song:  It's enough to make kings and vagabonds believe the very best  The William Hung Way:  It's enough to make kings and wiggabons believe the very best.   How cute is that?  Wiggabons..he is so my new hero!  I can't wait until his LP drops..."White Dragwon."  Am I being mean...nah...he lit up my life for just a moment and I think he rocks because he believes in himself.  So big thumbs up to you William Hung...you prove Simon, Paula, Randy wrong...you become the American Idol.  Vaginas, Drugs and William Hung...enough said.

       Eating Out   I have come to the conclusion that I will never eat out for breakfast, lunch or dinner again.  Not only did I get food poisoning last week from Subway but I had the opportunity to go the hospital yesterday to find out that I had gotten food poisoning from dinner Saturday night.  Considering that I couldn't even hold a glass of water down yesterday I knew something was wrong.  And the fact that I passed out at the hospital surely indicated something was wrong.  So no more eating out side the home for me.  Unless it involves the dinner partner from last Saturday's dinner.  I'll get fruit this time.  I mean it can't be that easy to get food poisoning from fruit...can it?  Other than that I go back to work tomorrow.  I'm feeling okay.  Except for where the doctor pressed on my stomach.  It hurts like a bitch.  And the fact that I can't help but think of that certain someone's smile/teeth.  Have any of you ever seen something about a person and just can't stop thinking about that certain feature?  God, what perfect, straight, white teeth.  Ummm...umm...good.

       It's almost 3am...   And I just got home with Cheri.  No Michael.  I can't see anything right now aside from a friendship developing.  However, might I add that seeing Michael's face at dinner in non-club lighting is oh so beneficial.  Not only did I think he was muy caliente before.  Jesus Christ throw some cold water on this guy because he is fucking gorgeous.  His teeth...words can't describe how much I'm hoping I have a bad dream tonight that involves certain people that I went out to dinner and to Deer Park with tonight.  Michael is very shy at least he was a the club.  Not that I was much different.  However, at dinner he was very amusing.  And did I mention that he is gorgeous?  Yeah it bears repeating.  Oh but what I wouldn't give to end that 4 years drought in the sex department.  Not that I haven't had the opportunity to have sex...with some crazy obessesive women...but damn.    Let it just go on record that I did have a faboo time at dinner.  The club I could have passed on.  Due to the techno/house music that they play nonstop.  Hello throw in a little variety.  It's not hard.  And also let it be on the record...   That whatever Michael would have wanted he could have had tonight.  And that he is so ooh la la in the looks department.   P.S. I so have to get a picture to put online for you all to see.  Patrick I think you would fall in love with him...or at least be aroused.

       Where have I been?   Aside from not writing since the 17th I have been sick.  Not the "oh I'm achey sick" but the "Oh My God make it stop" sick.  I got food poisoning on Wednesday.  I'm pretty much recovered.  Food poisoning sucks.  Really bad.  That is why I haven't been writing.  Today is the first day that I have actually been online.  I know you all have been missing me.  Thanks for caring.  Tonight is the date with Michael.  Dinner and a movie/bowling/pool.  I haven't decided exactly what will come after dinner.  And yes Patrick I am paying for it.  I'm going shopping with Cheri today in VA to find something to wear tonight.  Not that I don't have enough clothes but I figure I need something new to wear just because.  Plus I need a new scent.  I'm thinking Blue by Ralph Lauren.  It smells yummy.  Anyway wish me luck on the date.  My mother asked who I was going out with tonight since I didn't want to go to the Virginia Beach area with them.  I told her Cheri, Michael, and I think Angel.  She so thinks that Cheri and I are dating.  If she only knew the date was with Michael.  I'm hoping that sparks fly...I mean I do have the house to myself until tomorrow afternoon.  And no I'm not some big slut that is going to just jump in bed with Michael if the opportunity arises...I'll more like glide into bed...LOL.  Just joking.  Anyway, details will follow tomorrow.  Later ya'll

       Saint Patrick's Day   So at work we decided that we would have a seasonal tree up.  We started decorating it after I bought the tree for Christmas as a gift to the people I work with in my department.  So far it has been used for Christmas and Valentine's Day.  We are going to decorate it next for St. Pattie's Day.  Aside from the normal shamrocks and leprechauns one of my supervisors Shelby has found "beer ornaments" that have a beer mugs with fakes beer in it with a shamrock on the mug.  I think that this would be an awesome way to decorate the tree.  I mean the true meaning of being Irish is drinking from birth on.  Plus our Manager Tim said that the only reason he doesn't let us drink at work is because there is only one ladies room and one men's bathroom for the entire building and he doesn't want to have his employees outside squatting and pissing because the bathrooms are full.    I think I'm going to take a 40 in for the tree topper...that should make the tree perfect and show the true meaning of St. Patricks Day.  What do ya think?  Anywho, as I said earlier today I got to meet Michael who is my friend Cheri a.k.a Ling-ling's friend.  Her is on fire!  I mean gorgeous.  I think he is out of my league but when Cheri told him I said that he said that he didn't understand why I would think that.  He told her that he really enjoyed talking to me on the phone the couple of times we have talked.  Our encounter at Deer Park didn't go to well though because I was extremely tired from only having 2 hours of sleep and we really didn't get the chance to talk because at a nightclub you can infact not talk but yell at the top of your fucking lungs to communicate.  I told Cheri that I would like to see him again.  She hasn't had the chance to talk to Michael because they are working opposite shifts this week.  I haven't asked Cheri for his phone number yet because I think that he should be the one to give it to me the next time we go out.  He told Cheri that he wouldn't mind going out again.  This time I told Cheri that I would like to take her and Michael out to dinner so that there isn't a whole lot of awkwardness.  We will have a mutual friend there and if later we wanted to be alone Cheri would completely understand.  She is going to try to get ahold of him this week to see if he wants to go out to dinner this weekend or next weekend.  Please pray for me that things work out because I do enjoy talking to him and a relationship would be great right now and to have a guy that is as hot as Michael as my own...oh God the possibiliies.

       Untitled   Have you ever had the feeling that something isn't right?  You can't exactly think of the "what's not right" part but you know something or someone is having something happen to them.  Or is it just your mind playing tricks on you?  I hate when I get that feeling.  I hate it.  It starts off with the thought that something is going wrong.  Then I just zone out.  Random thoughts.  Then my hands start shaking.  And I get extremely cold.  What the fuck man?  From what I can remember I heard my mother get a phone call.  She started to cry.  This will happen within a month's time.  Someone's heart is going to give out on them.  Where does this shit come from?

       Thoughts as of the moment   Since I'm took the day off I have nothing better to do than write down current thoughts of the day:  1.  If I ate meat today would I get sick since I can't remember what meat tastes like at this point?  2.  Where can I get a nipple like Janet Jackson's with matching accessories (sunburst jewelry)?  Yeah the whole jewelry thing is hot on Janet.  3.  Which color in the Crayola box is the brightest?  Because that's the one I want to be.  4.  Will the naked images of Meg Ryan ever leave my mind?  And how does one make a fake penis as a movie prop?  *These questions came after I watched the movie "In the Cut."    5.  Do movie stores offer refunds on terrible movies?  I want a refund for the above movie.  As of the moment that's what is one my mind.  I'll write more later if something else should occur.

       Career Move   If I could be anything at this present moment of 5:53pm I would like to be either a dancer for Britany Spears or a song writer for Benadryll.  I mean I am already well versed in dancing.  Actually, I believe that I excel tremendously at dancing.  At least when it comes to what most people think a white man dancing entails.  I'm even better at lapdancing believe it or not.  Ask Angel and whoever was out with us that night at the Casino nightclub.  I haven't gave anyone or anything a lapdance in a long long time.  I think things will change as of this Saturday.  Although I have to wonder would I enjoy giving someone a lapdance or getting the lapdance?  I mean I'd love to get a lapdance from Prince but the excitement of giving a lapdance and being all mysterious and naughty is just a little too tempting.  Plus sex or whatever can happen regardless of who gives what.  Moving on because this topic can lead me in a really bad erection...I mean direction...LOL.  Since I don't kiss and tell the temptation to talk about these kinds of things makes me want to share more than I should.  Moving on like I said.  I would like to be a composer for a song dedicated to Benadryll and how much I love it for all that it does.  It takes away some of the sinus problems but more importantly it takes away the "being awake part of the night."  I heart Benadryll.  It and its pink luster are just the most wonder thing since NyQuil.  Tomorrow since I took the day off I think I will write my "Ode to Benadryll."    Today however since it is close to Valentine's Day I am going to try to write a little poem using some people's names that I find as my friends and people's names I find as friends that I would like to fuck (*wink...Patrick).  Ode to Everybody I can tie into this poem for Valentine's Day  Funny, beautiful, you are a complete dish, Happy Valentine's to my friend Trish.  Witty, fresh, and just don't give a damn, Give it up for my girl Sam.  Some call you Ling-ling, your driving is scary, Happy Vowrentine to asian gurl Cheri.  Oh my Gawd is all I can say, Loving you sent to my girl A.  I miss you so, you moved so far and it's being to stink, Sending love to Michigan to my friend Tink.  My best bud, who wears red panties with lace, Hey there, ho there, to my friend Ace.  On the west coast you are out of my reaches, I miss you more than you know my precious Peaches. (Erin...nothing rhymes with your name.)  Yeah you're hot,  At the traveling spot. You'd be my number one Valentine's hookup pick, Don't think of it as turning a trick, my precious Patrick. (Don't you feel special...four whole lines?)  So fucking on fire you burn my eyes like hell, One day I'll have a piece of you my Rafael.  I'd take this doll for a twirl, Hugs and kisses my Barbie Girl.  Yeah this poem is going to be discovered 1000 years from now and the human race will know that in 2004 the creatures that inhibited this planet were on crack.  But all in the same at least I thought of you.  Happy Early Velentine's Day.  Hugs and Kisses to everyone...even those people that are beauty challenged.

       Big Corporations Can Kiss My Ass   So today at work we found out that we were completely merged with United Health Care.  All you would think would be fine and dandy we were bought out by a 300 billion dollar revenue company.  Not so.  Here is the situation.  MAMSI gives it's employees at the beginning of each year 6 sick days and 3 floater/personal days.  I was due for my vacation February 25th.  I have used 46 of the hours I had between the nine given on Jan. 1st.  United does not have a classification for each time they give.  It is all lumped together in what is called PTO (Paid Time Off).  Well they were giving us 2 PTO days right off the bat.  Here comes the catch.  The spokesperson for United tells us that you have 2 PTO days but anytime you used while you were a MAMSI employee (i.e. my 46 hrs.) will be subtracted from the 16 PTO hours you have.  If you are dumb at math I will calculate this for you.  16-46= -30 hrs.  Yes I will have to take the PTO hours I earn each month from United and pay the hours back I used while I was a MAMSI employee.  So I'm starting off with United Health Care owing them 30 hours leave for leave I took when I wasn't even their employee.  To make matters worse the 2 1/2 days I have left of sick time will not be considered sick time.  It will now transfer to Debilating Fund.  It can only be used if I am in the hospital or a family member is in the hospital.  So for me to have a "0" zero balance on time I would have to work until July to make up the time that I somehow owe a company I just became an employee of as of TODAY.  There was a woman in the meeting who said "I have been here 5 years as a MAMSI employee.  I have saved up 120 hours of sick time.  Are you telling me that I cannot use this to take the day off to see the doctor or when I am just "sick?"  The spokeswoman replied "No you can only use it if you are in the hospital."  This to me is bullshit.  Reason 1:  How am I going to pay a company that I didn't work for until today back time that I used while working for another company? Reason 2:  How can you just convert our sick time into something that we will probably never have to use? Reason 3:  How can you deny me my vacation time because it happens on 2-25-04 and your policies are effect 2-21-04.  That is too close? Reason 4:  How can you tell us if we don't say yes or no to a 401k with you you will automatically deduct 3% of our wages and put it in a fund that you chosose? Reason 5:  How can we contact your HRDirect Department if we don't have access until 3-12-04? Reason 6:  How can you offer us a hotline for questions that is not toll free?  Are you going to pay my long distance bill? Reason 7:  How do you expect us to get answers from our supervisors when they just went to the meeting with us today? Reason 8:  Do you not realize that you are violating Federal Statues on Labor Laws deducting out of our paychecks without our permission or signature? Reason 9:  Can you tell that I'm pissed and on the job hunt?  If not then something unfortunately is wrong with you.  Just joking.  But seriously I have a Federal Attorney looking into the situation.  The Denton side of the family is coming out of this gayboy.  The bitch I have deep down inside of me combined with the Annie Denton in me is sure to get this fucked up issue resolved.  If you see me coming you better get under your desk because the Denton side has emerged and let me tell you it will not be pretty.  If you are going to bitch but don't have the balls to do anything about it then you my friend are fucked.  I however, have the balls and I'm taking it to the next level.  I may not have my degree in Politics yet but I'm damn near not so stupid that I can't see the violations this company is making when it comes to this merger and how its new employees as of 2-10-04 are being dicked over.  Honey I may be interested in dick but I'm certainly not going to be dicked over.  Peace.

       Yeah um okay   So Saturday D.C. was a no go because everyone took too long to get ready.  Am I depressed about it?  No.  We wound up going to Deer Park.  Did I have a fabulous time.  But of course.  All that eyecandy.  It was like walking into a male model party.  And to make it even better there was a drag performance at the end of the night.  It was more than amusing as this white dragqueen that resembled a witch sang Beyonce's "Crazy In Love."  I myself would have never wore the outfit that she chose but hey who am I.  A bra and booty shorts with pearls everywhere.  Did I mention she weighed like 350 lbs?  I'm exaggerating but mama was stacked.  A little too stacked to be wearing that outfit.  Anywho, I will be returning to Deer Park this Saturday.  More excitement I hope will ensue and that kiss I'm waiting for from Prince (yes Prince) better happen.  I have much more to post but I'm listening to Ralphy play the drums.  Damn he has a hot voice...yow-za!  Not only does he look good but oh that voice.  More to follow...but quite depressing stuff.  Maybe I'll wait until tomorrow.

       How soon we forget   I know I probably shouldn't even write about this but it wouldn't come up if I didn't feel it was important.  Knowing that I keep very few friends in my life it should also be known that these friendships are a lot more "intimate" than regular friendships.  A lot of time and emotions have been vested into building these friendships.  However, now I'm seeing that they are starting to fall like the Roman Empire.  They have held strong for so long but they are slowly deteriorating.  Not because that it is really one persons fault.  It is just time taking its toll I guess.  My friendships that are coming into light more than ever seem to be headed in the right direction.  I should have invested more time into these relationships than I did in the beginning.  It is funny how people just start losing the communication they once had.  The way the bonds they once shared start to disappear and you are not exactly sure that the other person sees this happening.  But if it happens it happens and there is not much else I can do about it.  Time makes people grow individually and it also makes people grow apart.    Maybe I'm selfish and want my friends just to be "my friends?"  I'd like to think that I'm always there for them but I don't know if I can say all of my friends are there for me exactly.  Whatever the case I finally admitted to myself that I am lonely as I have always been.  Alone.  But for some reason that doesn't bother me as much as most people say it should.  There is reasoning behind this however.    Now that people/friends know that I am at least half way out of the closet that is all they seem to recognize me by.  Everything has to be "gay."  I'm no longer just a friend I have become the "gay boyfriend."  I have become the reason they are faghags.  I don't say anything because I don't want to hurt them but my sexuality doesn't define me as an individual.  I've been told that I need to look my "gayest" because someone and I were going shopping.  Do I regret ever saying anything...sometimes.  It is because I'm no longer seen as "Paul" I'm seen as "the gay friend/boyfriend."  But whatever I guess I should be thankful that I even have friends.  Right?    I mean yeah I have always felt like the person on the outside looking in but sometimes in certain instances I feel like I'm part of the crowd.  But something is said or done that makes that feeling go far far away.  I'm starting to realize that me being alone right now is probably the best thing because I can "straighten" things out a bit and try to bring some understanding to my not so pleasant life right now.  More importantly my mother asked me the other night if I "could ever sleep with another guy?"  I told her yeah that it could happen.  I mean it already has so what makes me think any different.  She however does not know about this and really doesn't need to know.  She knows that I've fooled around with another guy before but in actuality I have done the deed with another guy before.  Anyway aside from me talking about things of the past she tells me "well if it ever happens I don't want to know about it because I don't think I could handle that."  Hello what did you think me saying "hey there mom I wanted to let you know that I'm attracted to men and women?"  Did you think that I just wanted to be friends with these people forever?  Doesn't this just change everything.  If she believes that I am just friends with a guy than it is okay but Lord forbid that I sleep with him.  This is a time when I wished I just would have kept my mouth shut but, I would have probably  stayed in my depressive/suicidal mood.  Which leads me to a confession that no one is aloud to repeat.  I had written about having a dream (which this actually occurred) but that I scratched my wrists and made them bleed was a lie.  I said that I woke up with the scratches.  Actually i cut myself about 20 times.  Something about seeing the blood flow out in the shower made me feel like I wasn't so far out of the loop of being "human."  The cuts have since healed and I have since realized how stupid I was to do this to myself.  I now have the mental picture of the blood flowing from my wrist and that alone is a reminder than while I may be the outsider I still am part of the human race no matter how far they try to push me away.  Yeah think happy thoughts.  Here is a link about Pet Mills.  It took me awhile to get the courage to read it but I finally did.   urlLink Pet Mill Webpage to be passed along.

       Me + Mary Kate and Ashley Eyemake= I Sparkle   Every now and again I like to get highlights in my hair.  Not always blonde but orange, red, blue, purple, skittles taste the rainbow.  However, the cost of highlights is out of control.  I mean come on my hair is like not even an inch long...okay a little of an inch.  Anyway I had bought this eye pencil eyeshadow thing for Halloween to use as I was dressing up as Mimi from Drew Carey.  Well after Halloween I thought I wonder what would happen if I put it in my hair?  It actually looks like highlights...plus I can get all kinds of different colors and they wash out that night.  I have gold, green, bronze, blue, pink.  But the deepest satisfaction aside from not having to pay $75 or whatever highlights is that it makes me sparkle.  I thought this from day one of the fake makeupy highlighting idea but it was confirmed when Pat at work told me that I "shimmer, glisten, I sparkle."  Is it just me or is she my inner dragqueen speaking from a woman's body?  Pat is becoming a sensational faghag and it is because of me...and my new alterego...Sparky McSparkles.

       Several of my new poems   I never share my "real" poetry if you will but I've decided why let it go to waste.   Fragments   Shattered glass scattered along my mind, Each piece a reflection that makes you, Original, one of a kind, beautiful.  Placing the pieces back together for wholeness, Each fragment brings a new reflection, Day by day more and more of you is repaired.  A mosiac of shyness and condemnation, You are the mirror that shuns its own reflection, Do you realize your potential?  If I put you back together and made you one, If I carried you so that you would never break again, Would you realize your fragments are incandescent?  A clash of theories on what your reflection shows, Self doubting and the other knowing the enchantment, You are a mirror upon the wall.   Summer   An angel that hovers in the corner, Watching with her newly found vision. She is the nightmare not the hope.  Does she even realize the torment, Her light brings disaster and choas. She is blinding not all seeing.  Floating as if held by the water, Above the sea that is drowing me. She doesn't breathe life but death.  A cold touch, a frosted breath, darkness, Does she realize she is the deliverer? She was the death to my love.   Unexplained   The arch that separates to the inner side of you A forming of lines that makes the day feel brighter. From this there comes the positive.  The piercing of the brown orbs that show you everything Would they show the feeling hidden inside? From this there comes the mystery.  An untouchable flame that is most inviting But at the same time so distant. From this there comes the negative.  A time that allows anything to happen The fleeting notion of what Pandora left. From this will come the answer.   Just Because   One day I'll fly away Leaving everything I know Hoping for the teachings of  Of that which cannot be spoken.  One day I won't be so blind I'll have vision to see what What others have yet to see And words they have not heard.  Today is the begininng and the end End of the day of realization For what my mind has seen And for what it has observed through speech.  Tomorrow is the past Present of what is now found Yesterday is now forgotten Never to be lived, seen or spoken of again.

       "My Goodness"   I think if I recall correctly that Shirley Temple says this in every movie she made.  With that she puts her little hand above her head and scratches it with her pointer finger.  She was so cute and grew into a beautiful woman.  I have no clue why I'm writing about Shirley Temple aside that I remember ooing on trips with my cousin Stacy when we were younger and my Aunt Cathy would take us to this restaurant somewhere in Annapolis, MD or so and we would order Shirley Temples.  I don't know why I remember that but I do.  I don't remember much from my childhood.  I rely mostly on relatives to tell me things that I used to do and can never seem to remember them even when they tell the stories.  I remember certain things due to my Uncle Dave filming them.  The one episode in the park which is beyond incriminating and embarassing.  Imagine a child in spandex bike shorts and a lime green I.O.U. shirt doing cheerleading with his amazon cousin Stacy (she towered over me then and still does) and my cousin by marriage (no blood relation)  Crystal (who I almost slept with one time at my Aunt Velma's house).  All you hear is my big squeaky voice doing some cheer that I thought was cool at the time.  Place that with the fact that I was so flamboyant that the QE team had nothing on me and you see what I'm talking about.  Anyway, that is in the past.  My favorite childhood memory is:  When Stacy and I were both living in Brooklyn, MD which is right outside of Baltimore City we were playing Barbies in her room on the bed.  Now Stacy always had the latest and greatest of Barbie.  We were playing getting them ready for the daily ball that all Barbies attend.  Stacy was brushing her dolls hair and the head popped off.  She was upset but figured out that you could just push it back on.  Well she pushed a little too tight and the head ate the neck.  It was the true meaning behind head and shoulders.  She asked me...  "Does she look okay with not having a neck?"  I said, "No she looks like shit Stacy...how many people do you see walking around with no necks?  She can't go to the ball looking a mess like that."  Stacy replied, "You are so mean.  Gimme your doll.  You get the ugly one with the bad hair."  She snatched my glamously done Barbie and gave me some haggard doll.  I replied, "That's okay I can work miracles even on your twin."  She ran downstairs crying and I laughed.  I knew at that moment I was headed toward utter fabulousness.  I knew at that moment I was a total "Bitch."  And I've reigned ever since.  Memories.

       I'm so going to Cleveland   Because Patrick is there and he doesn't think I'm hideous as does the rest of the internet population.  Damn chatrooms.   Does anyone remember...   The show with Muffy the Mouse who lived in a penthouse inside a department store.  There was a magic maniquin and the security guard was a puppet.  And there was this black lady with really bad jericurl taking care of the toy department.  If so please leave the name on my comments because it drives me crazy that I can't think of the name.    Aside from that Muffy rocked!  She was a cute little gray puppet rodent with blonde hair and buck teeth.  She is my hero.  Plus the vact that she had an elevator in her house...damn now that's living.  It is so frigid outside.  I have a feeling mother nature isn't going to be so sparing with the "coming of the precipitation."  The newscasters say that it should most likely be rain on the local weather.  (Note:  The local weather in WV is basically a really fat and middle aged man guessing).  The weather channel says however, that there will me "muchos de hielo" or a lot of ice.  Anyway you look at it tomorrow will be shitty.  I'm not expecting more than the "dark and gloomies."  And yes I have to travel in the bullshit to get a CT Scan on my sinuses.  That should be buckets-o-fun.     My two cents...   So I find that a lot of people find 50 Cent attractive.  Am I the only one that thinks he could be the fourth "Chipmunk?"  I mean yeah he is all built and all but what the fuck happened to the face.  I think more than one bullet penetrated that disaster.  He to me is just a big no no.    1.  No your teeth are not bucking out like that and you have the money to get them bitches fixed. 2.  No your eyes don't always resemble someone high on crack...there are surgeries for that problem. 3.  No you really don't need that bullet proof vest and bomb proof Hummer...both in God and my eyes are hideous.  And now moving on to more important matters Clay Aiken.  Yeah my motherfuckin eyes are achin' from the ugliness you exude.  Damn but if he doesn't look like he is made out of molding clay.  And the accent...oh hell no.  Where the hell are you from again?  Go to a fucking speech therapist bastard you have the fucking money.  Damn.  I mean yeah he has a good voice for being twigboy but try to at least ennunicate your words.  Hello you are a public figure.  Again he is a no no.  1.  No your hair does not resemble the inside of a fucking skittle bag...please change your hair technician. 2.  No your mouth is not bigger than the Mississippi is wide...keep that pit closed. 3.  No you actually are the ugliest monster I have ever seen...Beauty and the Beast is touring...have an audition?  I am really being hard on these people.  I mean yeah they must have something I am lacking..."looking fucked up in public."  Whooo!  Jesus I know I should not be judging people but holy hell Batman these people bring me some night tremors.  Rupaul without makeup is scary...these two are just plain physically impaired with no chance of recovery.  Yeah I had a good day.  Actually a very good day.  Some things just have to be said and damnit if I'm the one to deliver the message than so be it.

       Goodnight...   Yesterday I spent the whole day having dizzy spells.  It sort of reminded me of when I was tripping on acid and laying in the bed with my eyes closed but I could still see the room spinning.  Today they are a little better.  Last night proved a no go to any club or anything.  So it's strike two in the meeting Michael department.  But I'm fine with that because of the dream I had last night.  Now I usually don't remember dreams or the actual "picture" of the dream.  I remember conversations and things that are spoken.  I know this sounds weird but ever since I was in 7th grade when I had this dream that my friends Sandy and Mary died in a fire and the next day the announcement was made at school it had happened I really don't like to dream about people or dream at all.  Amanda you know that nothing good comes from me dreaming of people in my dreams...remember the time we died in that car crash dream?  Yeah...I'm a total catch for any of you single men or women out there!!  Anyway aside from my weird psychic/psychotic ability the whole dream was the following:  The Picture part I remember:  Getting into a bottle of Percocet and having an endless supply.  (This could reflect my old dependency on narcotics...or that I was feening last week).  The Spoken part I remember:  My mother voice kept on lecturing me on how I "needed a woman to make my life better".  Then she states "You know I've come to realize something I don't care if you are sleeping with another guy because..." (note: something is seriously wrong with my brain) "...Paul's milkshake brings all the boys to the yard and their like it's better than yours damn right it's better than yours."    I know that this dream really isn't that funny or anything...I think it borders on the lines of weird and disturbing...but I liked it.  To hear my mother sing "Milkshake."  That is priceless.  Now if I could only get her to do this in real life.    I feel that it has been decades since I have spoken to Ralphy.  I got on Yahoo messenger the other night and some guy left me a message "Okay let's see what you've got Paulie."  I wonder who he was?  But the real point of this is a memory I have to share.  So everyone knows that I'm very hmmm...how to put it...kinky/dirrty/naughty.   I'm a closet freak.  So when I was younger I would get online and go to the chatrooms.  I had heard of cybersex and everything but never thought to try it until I was about 16.  It was like 3am when I had finally settled on a guy to cyber with.  I thought to myself how am I going to act like a seasoned pro when I have never done this before?  I thought should I write like Danielle Steel or like a porn star?  I voted for porn star.  Well the whole "first cybersex experience" went okay.  It surely didn't turn me on or anything I mean come on it's only words.  Anyway, after that first experience I became an addict.  I'm saying 6 or 8 people a night.  I had people hunting me down when I would leave chatrooms.  I became the cyberslut.  I had several different users names.  Some I used to cyber with men...some with women.  One to just go online and talk.  Anyway, after establishing my reputation as a good "cyber fuck" I started asking for pictures.  Did I get them?  Hell yeah.  Summer had created a dummy email account where we would keep them.  I wish I could remember the name and password.  I had amassed a collection of about 650 pictures in the matter of six months.  I was on top of my game.  Summer and I would get online at the same time and do "cyber threesomes" with who ever.  It was a game.  See how many pictures and people you could "get off."  Then it happened...some guy had to ruin it.  I had cybered with him several times because I thought he could keep up and not just sit there and write "oh yeah" and "uhhh" he could actually add to the whole encounter.  Anyway, he had somehow found out my name, address, and telephone number.  I have no clue how but he did.  He sent me an email saying he would be calling.  So then and there the whole game stopped.  I haven't cybered since I was about 17 or 18.  He never called but I've never wanted to take the chance again.  I mean it's pretty bad when you are so good at talking dirrty to people that they actually try to come in real contact with you...he was really good looking though...what was I thinking?    Today I may cyber...it's been so long I don't think I remember how to talk dirrty?  Yeah right.

       Answer me this...   How is it that I can feel for someone that I have never met?  I have talked to Ralphy for almost a year now and when I talk to him for like the first time in eons I am all giddy again.  What the fuck!!  But it is not like that I want you type of feeling it is knowing that I am talking to him as a friend.  I can't say that I'm completely over the whole crush thing but I just like knowing that he is in my life still.  He means so much to me and yet I have never met him.  I am totally attached to him as a friend.  He is such a good person.  I have learned that sometimes it is okay to let people in and trust people over the net.  Just think if I would have never responded to his first IM what would life be like now?  Weird thought.  Today at work I wrote something but I am saving that for another day because it is way a downer.  I cried at work today however.  What is my problem?  I feel like a woman gonig through menopause or something.  I was text-messaging Cheri :) and I asked her "How is it that I deserve to have you in my life?"  It was just a question that I have wanted to ask her for a while.  She responded that "I am a person that gives unconditional love, giving of myself, and that I make people happy while putting my feelings aside and I deserve her because I need to be reminded of that often and shown the love that I have always been lacking and she is the one that wants to do that."  Hello wouldn't you have cried too?  I was like "OH MY GAA" (  So everyone in the family knows about Cheri and I except for Stacy, Phil and Allan.  I'll tell them shortly when I go to Baltimore next weekend.  My grandmother is overjoyed of course.  All of Cheri's relatives know in Taiwan.  And her family here as well knows.  Everyone thinks we are crazy.  And I can't say that it doesn't seem a little crazy but I haven't been so sure of anything like this in about 6 or 7 years.  So just know that it is being done for all the right reasons and that I wouldn't have given her a ring if I didn't mean it.  And she wouldn't have taken it if she didn't mean it.  Night everyone I have to work over tomorrow for leaving work early today to take Cheri to D.C. to her doctors appointment.  Shaw Yong Mai decided she didn't want to take Cheri at the last minute so I spent the afternoon in D.C. without a jacket and freezing my balls off.  Ta-toodles!!

       Red envelopes   I so know about the red envelopes!!  I watched Cheri's Uncle's wedding video last night and Cheri explained the whole process and the red envelopes.  Money...money...money...money....MONEY!!  More later...off to see my sweetheart (aka Pookie)!   How gross is that?   Spill the Beans   So I'm talking to Ralphy right now and I thought "Hey I need to write a quick note in the blog."  I told my grandmother today!  She is beyond happy!  I go to Taiwan in November.  I get married in the states in August.  No other news as of yet.

       Nerves   I am so nervous right now.  I have to tell my grandparents that I am engaged.  I know that it is happy news but for some odd reason I am nervous about having to say.  It is just big news.  I know that my grandparents are going to go all spastic and be overjoyed but I'm nervous.  I never thought I would say that I was engaged to a woman.    Now let me explain this marriage.  First of all Cheri and I have decided that this is an open marriage.  If she wants to have a boy or girl friend or if I want a boyfriend she and I can have one.  The reason that we are getting married is truly because we love each other.  We have talked for hours on the subject and realize that we both offer each other what we have been looking for for a long long time.  We offer each other unconditional love, trust, friendship, emotional support.  We are non-judging of each other, always able to express our emotions to each other, we have a relationship that is not effected by sex which we feel really destroys a lot of relationships.  Yeah we have talked about having kids which yes will happen.  Wether it be the natural way or invetro it will happen.  Cheri's mother Yong Mai told Cheri today that Apo and Apu (the Mardarin word for grandmother and grandfather) will love me because I am a very kind and generous person.  Also that I have a nice and beautiful face will make them like me even more.  So it is good to know that Cheri's mother supports us.  We are not planning the wedding for any time soon but we are still engaged.  Cheri's mother is buying my wedding band in Taiwan and bringing it back.  Cheri's mother loves Cheri's ring so I am happy for that.  I just have to save up to get the wedding band for Cheri...it is another $1500.  Oh and did I mention that after our wedding here we are going to Taiwan to stay with her family and getting married there as well.  I was told last night that we have to have a Chinese wedding too.  Also I was taught the proper customs last night for a wedding in Taiwan.  Cheri is making the attempt to teach me as much as possible.  I told her and her mother that I am willing to learn as much as they are willing to teach me.  I am going to have Cheri to teach me so Mandarin so that I can try to communicate with her grandparents and relatives to a point.  I know it will not be easy but I want to learn.  So anyway, I'm excited that I now have a fiancee and I am someone's fiance.  I never thought I would be this excited about getting married....but I am.  And I can actually get married.  It sucks that if I find someone (a guy) I can't marry him yet...I mean I can but not in every state.  That needs to be changed.  And yes we have thought about if someone else wants to marry us that they will just have to deal with being with us knowing that we are already married.  Yeah I know this sounds like a big old mess but truly neither of us see the relationship ever really being more than just the two of us.  We just want to have the option.

       It's official   I'm am officially under the title of "fiance."  I got Cheri her engagement ring today.  It is beautiful.  $8000 worth of beautiful.  But Cheri is well worth the investment.    The ring is a grade E diamond (the grades start at D so yeah it's almost perfect).  It is a princess cut center diamond that is .63 carats, with (2) .25 cts on each side and then 6 smaller princess cut diamonds on the band.  The total weight of the ring is 1.45 carats. I'll take a picture soon so I can post it.  So yay me...I'm a fiance!!  The ring doesn't sound like much for 8k but it is the quality.  The ring is beautiful I have never seen one like it before.  Wayne get to planning this thing...hello!!  Patrick...my back is hurting continuously throughout the day and the medicine I take is not working any longer.  But it is something I have to deal with.  And you are so sweet for asking!

       Suspended   I know this might seem gross and what not but I really don't give a shit.  Have you ever been driving down the road, street, highway, whatever and spit a piece of gum out the window?  Have you noticed that for one or how ever many milli-seconds that it stays suspended in the air?  I noticed that today on the way home when I spit out my gum.  I thought to myself..."Interesting, yet beautiful."  I'm on the verge of having a summer wedding.  And a future boyfriend.  Cheri and I have discussed getting married this summer and it looks like there is an 80% chance.  Michael pretty much knows that I like him "in that way."  When he was told by Missy (Cheri's girlfriend...like not your girl who is a friend...like I love you my girlfriend) he blushed, smiled, and trotted away.  He had no clue.  He does now.  Anyway, my back is hurting and I'm off to relax since I've only gotten a total of 6 hours of sleep since Sunday, watch a couple of movies, and grab something to eat.  I just thought of how pathetic I am.  I write down everything...how interesting is it knowing that I'm hungry, ready to watch a movie, and relax?  Not very I assure you.  Anywho, I'm seriously thinking about seeing a sleep specialist.  Insomnia rocks when you really need to stay awake but when it comes to "being productive" it is a pain in my ass.    P.S. Cheri is doing very well.  I am so getting the affection I was looking for from her.  Not like that type...holding hands, a kiss here and there, hugs, having someone to cuddle on the couch with.  Aww...I'm about to be sad.  She is so cute.  And my fiance.  Yeah I forgot to mention we refer to each other as "my fiance" now.  Wayne, good suggestion on colors...Cheri loves glittery things and purple is her second favorite aside from pink.  But I the sad part is I can see myself wearing a white tuxedo (which personally I find disgusting) covered in glitter shaped hearts.  That would be a great Kodak moment.  Enough babbling...and again I repeat myself...if you have never been go to  urlLink Patrick's site .  Tanning Bed Virgin....LMAO!

       Blogging should be made law   I think that everyone needs to blog.  Wether it be once a day or once a week, month, whenever.  Not only is it good for the soul but it also provides about an hour of entertainment for me a day.  I am seriously thinking about writing someone in the government (which it doesn't matter because they are all bastards) and telling them that it would be beneficial to the school system to have children start writing in online journals.  It would help them learn about themselves, learn about other people (races, sexes, sexualities), and plus it would give them a chronicle of their lives.  I am so in a political mood right now.  Go Gay Marriage!!  Anyway,  urlLink Cyn  never let's me down.  Her comment about if you want a piece of pie come over "I'll be vacuuming in high heels." Has totally validated my day as being a good one.  Cheri had her surgery today.  I haven't heard from her yet so I'm assuming that everything went well.  I mean she did have surgery on her lip so I'm thinking that she can't talk.  Otherwise, I would have heard from her.  I think I'll call Yong Mai, Cheri's mom to get an update.  By the way there may be a summer wedding in the future.  Cheri and I are talking about getting married this summer.  Not because we're crazy but because we love each other and because we realize that she can have her boyfriends/girlfriends and I can have my boyfriends.  Plus we both want kids and I think we would make lovely children.  If we decide to get married I am so having in a location that all my bloggie buddys can attend.  And suggestions for colors?

       Thou Shalt Not Be Made To Touch Thy Friends Booty   Unless you know deep down inside you've been wanting to do this for a while.  At Deer Park last night Cheri took my hand and latched it onto Michael's booty without me even know what was going on.  That is until I felt he "firm and round" booty as I told him it was.  Hotness was the main event last night.  We all looked killer.  Cheri in her salsa inspired red dress, Michael in his fatigue/army inspired outfit, Me in my Hawaiian/Cowboy DKNY.  Cheri danced with a lesbian.  I'm not pinpointing sexuality here but Cheri is proclaimed straight however, Michael and I have sneezed so much pixie dust on her let's just say she's explored the other side of the rainbow and she liked it.  To make things worse is that I was supposed to keep her in line last night.  I failed and she got Lori's digits.  Lori is one of the hottest butch dragking lesbians I have ever seen.  She is extremely doable.  Anyway, after we left the club we went to Denny's (I thought I was going to puke) and saw the most God awful looking people I have ever seen in my life.  I mean it was like a total freakshow.  I know it's not nice to talk about people but damn these people were toe' the fuck up.  We saw a woman the size of Nebraska, the asian version of Brittney Spears, a dragqueen with full on make up but wearing dirty clothes, chicks with fatrolls for days and then out of the blue came..."Blue sweater Boy" or "Brock" the name that I gave him.  Gorgeous...made the trip to Denny's worth while.  Oh yeah and I got to see Cheri's ass underneath the table.  Girl has got a slammin body but the ass...damn.  Her thong was so cute.    So basically last night was about me touching and looking at booty.  I can't complain.  Weird happening:  Michael gave me a very very wonderful hug last night that I wasn't expecting.  Could it be that his walls are breaking down and he is finally opening his eyes.  (Michael is looking for a model or eye candy whatever you want to call it.  He is going for style not substance in this situation)  Cheri and I both think he is starting to realize he'll never be with anyone that will treat him right if he basis it all off looks alone.  Hello I'm Mr. Personality here and I'm not model material but damn I not ugly either.  Please let Cheri's advice last night go through his thick skull.  Her exact words were "You need to stop looking for a model.  9 times out of 10 he will be arrogant and treat you like shit.  Looks fade but personality doesn't.  You need to look at what is right in front of you."  Hello even though I wasn't in the car at the time the reference should be crystal clear.  God why does he have to be so hot?

       Unbelieveable   Wednesday night I decided to write to Margaret Cho.  Here is the email I sent in response to her writing about Amadou Diallo:  Margaret,  I have visited your site several times and I must say that this entry made me cry.  Being a gay male and just recently coming out to my family (aside from my father) I have started to take long hard looks at things that I once brushed off.  I have always been for racial, gender, sexual equality.  I have seen and experienced so much hate myself that I couldn't imagine what it would be like if I were not white.  I honestly get sick at the thought of what it must be like.  I have seen "police brutality" toward African Americans because I was in the car with them.  Almost went to jail for losing my temper with the officers however, I was never handcuffed or told to get against the car.  My female African American friends however, were made to do these things.  So I just wanted to tell you that I really appreciate you writing about Amadou Diallo.  It is a story I will make sure to pass along to friends.  And if I'm not being to pushy do you have any advice for how I could tell my father about me being gay?  This is the last and final step to me being truly free...honestly.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  And by the way you are one hot mama and The Notorious C.H.O. is a staple in my house.  Much love and again thank you,  Paul   The only thing missing is my last name and address.  Anywho, I really didn't think anything of it.  You rarely ever hear back from someone who probably gets thousands of emails a day.  However, I got an email back:  Hi Paul,  Your beautiful email was forwarded to Margaret and she mentioned you in  her blog entry today (not by name of course). http://www.margaretcho.com/blog/blog.htm  Thanks so much for your kind words.  Keri Smith Cho Taussig Productions, Inc.  This is what she wrote:  A special message to the guy that needs to come out to his homophobic father: Tell him what is happening in Rhea County. Tell him that you are being referred to as 'them.' Ask him if he would consider the boy he raised, his own child, his creation, part of his body, his life, his everything - ask him if he would think of you as less than human because you choose to love someone. Someone who would also be referred to as 'them.' Ask him if he understands that you have the ability to love, that was passed down to you through him, and since he was successful in teaching those difficult lessons, if it would mean any less if you were loving a man?  I am so happy.  Not because I was mentioned but the fact that I really really appreciate the advice.  Anyway, what is the point of asking advice when you don't follow through with it?  I think that it is time.  No more hiding, no more running, just me.

       Happy Gotta Wear Green Day   I forgot to is the sad part.  But being the creative diva that I am I created Shamrock earrings with fun foam shamrocks and paperclips.  I took a lime green table cloth that was at work and made it into a cape.  Yay me for creativity.    My productivity level at work today was absolutely astonishing.  I did two cartwheels, two round-offs, a handstand, a toe touch, and never got caught by a supervisor.  My audience enjoyed the show.   Like I haven't said this 100 times before   But  urlLink Patrick , the man of my dreams is such a sweetheart.  On his site which I recommend you visit daily, and you will, he wrote poems for many of his adoring fans, I being one of them.  If you want to know what he wrote about me you will have to click on his name and read it.  I want him to get more and more readers because he is truly entertaining.  So visit his page or I will blow fairy dust on you and turn you gay.  In return I want to write a poem for my future husband (*wink...wink Patrick*).  And please remember Patrick I have only written a poem for 7 people my entire life.  So here we go:   Patrick's Song   We wish so much to find the one Letting our emotions come undone Who said this journey would be fun?  When you find that someone like I found you You want to stick to them like glue Everyday a thought shared so fresh, so new.  Your thoughts and antics make me roar Sometimes I'm laughing on the floor Snickering until my body is sore.  Cute as hell but offering so much more I'd love to see you at my door Is this proposal number three or four?  You bring me up when I feel down Whether being serious or acting like a clown You are a king but where is your crown?  You leave comments that hit the spot Did you know that this means a lot? Now you do so you can't say not.  Intelligent through your writing and wit The Traveling Spotlight is the shit Could you be anymore physically fit?  What I'm saying is there is no other A friend someone I can call my brother I'd love to one day meet you and your mother.  I appreciate every word that you note Your blog it has my #1 vote I hope you like this poem I wrote.  Just know that someone out there does care Whether you're fat, thin, a drawer of stare Patrick and Paul sounds like a perfect pair. (*wink*)  If you ever decide it is time to settle down All joking aside my cutie McClown Hopefully I'll be the one around.  My offer still stands to take you to bed To hold your hand and be legally wed What do you think of a wedding in red?  I'm glad I looked around the bend My dear Patrick you are my friend.  Hope you like it Patrick!!  Night folks!!

       Certainly you must be joking?   What the FUCK????  I can't get onto anyone's blogs at the present time.  My daily ritual has been shattered.  Shattered, shredded, destroyed.  Daily ritual:  Wake up Get ready for work Drive to work Sit at work and think of working Get off of work Drive home BLOG time!! Read, television, whatever time Insomniac sleeping schedule time always subject to change (usually 20 minutes every 2-3 hours)  So as you can see I must have done something wrong today to deserve this.  I didn't come straight home.  I got my hair cut.  Did this throw off the whole daily ritual?  Alas, I shall never know.  Ganesha, you are so not removing the obstacles like you are supposed too.  For those of you who don't know who Ganesha is He the Hindu God for the removal of obstacles and the God of good fortune.  He is worn around my neck 24-7.  Yes he sees me naked in the shower.    And now that I've made that statement I'm thinking that maybe he doesn't want to and this is my punishment.    Work today was the equivalent to Dante's Inferno.  As the day progressed and I traveled through the different levels of Hell (for me it would be levels of time) it just got worse and worse.  I tried to resolve a problem by asking to be sat by my lonesome.  The less interaction I have with people the better off I am but Jerry my supervisor did not seem to think that was a solution.  I think he really needs to re-evaluate the situation.  I'm way more productive when I'm alone.  Not that I don't love my partner in crime Cheryl it is just that I need a break from what I'd like to call the "estrogen factor."  Too much estrogen in one place equals me turning into "The Queen of all Bitches" and having a postal/open target moment.  I'm filled with testosterone (even though I probably didn't spell it correctly) but there comes a time when the estrogen starts to seap into your skin and your "inner bitch" emerges.  I am just trying to not have that happen.  I need some alone time.  Or with the right person some "don't leave me alone time."    I'm thinking the odds are on the "alone time."  Night everyone!

       Afternoon Kitties...   Yesterday was wonderful.  The best day I've had in a long time.  Picked Cheri and Michael up and headed to D.C.  First of all let's clear things up here.  Cheri is from the "Illadel" or "Philadelphia" and I am from "B'more" or "Baltimore."  Michael however, has been born and raised in West Virginia.  He has never really taken in the experience a city has to offer.  So we go to Cheesecake Factory for lunch.  First of all I can't talk.  My mind was set on "let Paul mispronounce every word he possibly can today" mode.  Cheri was the exact same way.  Michael is just freaking out because he rode the Metro for the first time and also that the escalators were so long.  It was so cute.  I just wanted to pinch his cheeks until the Jessica Simpson moment came:  Michael asks, "Are we supposed to use these napkins to wipe our mouths?" in reference to the material napkin.  The inner WV in him came out.  His new nickname given by yours truly is "Napkins."  How creative?  Any way, so then we go to Hechts.  I purchased new CK boxer briefs and a pair of CK trunks with red bands and grey writing.  Oh hell yeah.  And helped Michael find his CK's.  I know exactly what types, yes types, of underwear he wears now and knowing that makes the imagination that much better.  Then I bought a new DKNY Jeans shirt.  I love it however, my father seems to think that $70 for a top is ridiculous.  I however don't.  At any rate we wandered around D.C. until around 830pm and then came back to exchange my Mercedes for the Blazer since we would be driving directly back into D.C. to go to  urlLink Wet  and to  urlLink Nation .  So anywho we get to Wet and I'm like this is going to be fun watching naked men dance around on the bar...this is me being sarcastic.  I really wanted to go dancing not become a dancer.  However, about 20 minutes after being there we three went to the bar.  Out comes this guy who is stripping on the otherside of the bar.  I look him dead in the eyes when he turns around.  He makes his way over to Michael and I.  He does a little of this and that for Michael.  Michael tips him (you put the money in their socks because that's all they have on)...and then he comes over to me.  We start talking...hold up...talking...how many people do you know that start talking to a man who is buck naked in front of them?  Obviously one now.  I'm thinking Jesus Christ he is beautiful and his teeth.  So he decides to dance and la la la.  He bends back down and we talk a little more.  He kisses me.  Dances a little more.  And then I tell him to come back down and inform him that he has a beautiful face.  He blushes because he expected me to say something low and shallow about his body like very one else does.  He dances a little more, bends down, gives me another kiss and disappears off the stage because he had to prepare for another number.  Patrick, The Perfect Teeth Stripper, is so so yummy.  And I found a picture for you all to see.  I had my picture phone on me but at the time I really wasn't much concerned with a phone.     Please notate that Patrick is the one missing his shirt.  Not the not so attractive guy.  Then we left after watching Alex strip to "Toxic" by Brit and headed to Nation.  Danced, got to hear some member of the Pointer Sisters perform, saw some hideous dragqueens, saw a guy from Wet that was stripping earlier...it was his first time.  He said he wouldn't do it again because he just couldn't but I know he will...he was really really hot.  Got tired, drove home, I got home at 4:56am this morning.  Went to bed at 5:36pm.  Now I'm ready for next weekend.  This is the end all of weekends because Cheri has her surgery the Tuesday after.  So Hot Damn...bring on next weekend.  I'm not being biased but I think we should go visit so Patrick for me, Rob for Michael, and Alex for Cheri (even though he's gay) next weekend.  But then again you never know...wink wink Mai!!

       Bloggedy Blog McBloggerworth   That is what I have decided my journal shall be called.  I'm thinking about changing the address.  If I do I'll let ya know.  But then that would cause all kinds of "damn it now we have to change our links" confusion and frustration.  So I'll think long and hard before I take action.  To Mr. or Mrs. Anonymous:  Do I know you?  If so, who are you?  The next time you decide to leave a comment please feel free to leave your name so that I can put a face to the comment.  Best wishes for you this weekend and if you should happen to catch the bubonic plague don't expect flowers.    Sincerely,  Paul  P.S.  I'm glad that you took the time to write a comment twice on my journal seeing that I erased the first one.  That just means you are interested in what I have to say.  Smooches!!

       Hawke Eye   Today at work the phonelines were down for 3 and 1/2 hours.  Beneficial.  To the company...no.  To me...yes.  So I went to the store to pick up some Hot Peppers and Olives (yeah did I mention I think I'm pregnant?)...and a magazine.  I decided there was nothing that appealling so I settled for Details.  Ethan Hawke was on the cover.  Flipping through the magazine was like looking at Greek Gods...all of these men were chizeled, tan, and oh so on my "doable" list.  Anyway, the whole point of this story is that when I got to the article on Ethan Hawke (which by the way I didn' read) I could not believe how hot he still is.  He was modeling designer duds and working out.  He was hot in Gattaca and at 40 or whatever he is still remains a "hottie."    Cheryl told me today that if "something became popular I would be the one to have it."  I think that was a little rude.  I mean if "cubic zarconia rings" were popular and the in thing I wouldn't have one.  I prefer silver anyway.  She thinks that just because I just purchased my Louis Vuitton wallet that I'm some kind of freak when it comes to having popular/in style things.  She said that because my parent's bought a Mercedes that I had to have one because they had one.  That is complete and udder bullshit because I was the one that wanted the Mercedes to begin with...my parents thought it was ridiculous to have such an expensive car...but they became hippocrits.  Just because I like the finer things in life doesn't make me a bad person does it?  I work for what I purchase.  If I can't have it I don't throw a fit until I get it.  I wait and get it when I can.  Yeah I may not wear "non-namebrand" things and drive a nice car, and carry a nice wallet but I've worked for every piece of it.    Am I right to think that she was rude?  Am I too materialistic?  Do I have to start shopping at the Bargain Bin(this is made up) just to not be considered this way?  Or have I proven my point that I work, I bring home the bacon, I buy what I want?  I give to charity ever two weeks when I get paid.  It's not like $100 or anything but it is a good amount.  I give clothes to shelters, volunteer at community centers, and am always willing to help any of my friends and family out.  I think I'm a very caring person.  And it just so happens that I care about myself in the process.    Damn people and their comments.  She didn't complain when I gave her Godiva chocolate today.  I'm going to watch Clueless and think more about this.  I really need to know if I'm that vain/egotistical/materialistic?    Or am I just being "gay" about the whole thing?  Ya...ha...ha...I'm over it...like last seasons D&G sandals that I ordered but never came.  Toodles kids!!

       Validation   Bill left a comment saying that the whole thing about me kissing Cheri when we meet and greet so validates my "Gay Card" even more...and even more if I yell "Mon Cheri" at the time.  Is it weird that I call her that all the time?  And that I have chocolates from Spain that are going to be given to her that say "Mon Cheri" on them?  My "Gay Card" has been validated and I'm planning on running for President of the Gay Card Club of America.  With these qualifications I'm a Prada shoe in.  Other than that today was boring.  And progessed to the point that Hell became more and more appealling as a place for me to relocate to.    Life at this point is as motivating as a ball of lint.  But I'm thinking the lint has it better because it can be swept away to a new and exciting place.  I however, am stuck like a needle.

       Education   Is it just me or have I become a teacher of fashion to the women I work with.  Several of the women...actually way more than several of the women ranging from ages 19-50 did not know who Louis Vuitton is.  Hello people you see the signature monogramming everywhere these days.  So I have taken it upon myself to let them exam the wallet while explaining the origin of Louis Vuitton, where it can be purchased, pricing, and how they really should buy me the keychain change holder I want for my services.  Tomorrow's lesson is Prada and the new Spring/Summer line of purses they may want to look into buying.  Also several people are going to be informed of the cardinal rule of white shoes/sandals/pants/purses before Memorial Day.  I'm working with a bunch of women who just have no clue what the hell they are doing to themselves when they get dressed in the morning.  I am suggesting to Marlene the Director of our building and the VIP of our building that we have a department field trip to Washington D.C. so that I can teach these people culture, fashion, history, and for God's sake GODIVA...somone actually has never heard of GODIVA...am I crazy or does my job totally resemble a bad episode of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy?"  Except my show is "Queer eye for the Straight Woman."  The only guy I think is worth looking at is Reggie...can we say hottie McHotter than Hell in the middle of drought season.  P.S.  I'm so thinking that kissing Cheri everytime we greet and say goodbye has it's benefits.  I mean she's hot and by God does she have great lips!  Does this revoke my "Gay Card?"  or is it just an added bonus of being her "Gay Boyfriend" and she my number one "FagHag?"

       Coffee and Me   Today to stay awake at work:  2 Starbuck's Double Shots 1 Grande Mocha Frappaccino  6 Caffeine pills  To keep me awake yesterday:  1 Louis Vuitton Wallet (and I'm lovin' it) 1 Bottle of Sentiment by Escada 1 Piece of limited edition Godiva Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake 1 Trip to William Sonoma 1 Trip to The Body Shop 1 Trip to Dupont Circle (Hello D.C.'s gay mecca) 1 Necklace of Ganesha (To ward off obstacles)  Knowing that spending $400 on myself isn't such a bad thing because Cheri verified it after I said:  "I feel so bad for buying all this stuff for myself.  I mean I could have given this money to charity or some homeless people."  Cheri replies:  "Don't feel bad..they don't work...we do...we deserve Louis Vuitton...they need to get a job.  Hello Paul what were you thinking."  Oh how she brings me down to Earth.  This weekend is another shopping trip to D.C.  Fuck the historical aspect of D.C. give me Versace!!

       La de fucking da   Today proved to be one of the hardest days at work.  The whole "you get paid to work not sleep" thing was a complete disaster.  Does one napping at their desk make them a bad employee?  I mean it was only for a period of ten minutes...several times throughout the day?  Now that I've left work I have energy.  I think the whole "sleep" issue is caused by me working.  End of story.  Cheryl's dog Buddy died this morning.  She was a total wreck at work.  But she understands that it was better off for him to expire considering he had cancer.  I just feel so bad for her.  Thank God, Buddha, Alah, Whoevah tomorrow is Friday.  Friday equals Saturday which equals shopping in D.C.  Oh but what a boring life I lead.  However, the Louie Vuitton wallet I have picked out for purchase this weekend will make it not so apparent...for me anyway.

       Kids   Sometimes I think that it would be nice to have kids...then I listen to Angel's children on the phone and I know it is meant for me to have children.  But she has to raise them.  Not me.  I don't even know how describe how off the hook Rasia and Jassiah are?  These children sing every fucking song known to man...Rasia is now singing Avril Lavigne's "Complicated" but it is "Why you'd go and make things so concentrated?"  How cute is that?  I so need a pair of matching children so keep next to my shoes.  They are now singing "My girl loves to party all the time" by Eddie Murphy.  I'm in heaven.  I can infact die.  Right now.  Speaking of singing when Michael, Cheri and I were shopping in Winchester on Sunday at Suncoast Video they were playing "The Wizard of Oz."  It was at the part where the Lion sings "If I were king of forest."  Some burly woman decided that she would just bust out in song with Cheri.  It was magical.  It was scary.  Hey it sort of turned me on.  Anyway, this woman did not hold back...it was like she was auditioning for Broadway.  She infact would have gotten the part because she herself did not need a costume...she was the costume.  Enough said.  Had a good conversation with Aunt Velma today.  Everyone needs an Aunt V in their life.  I have one...you don't...feel jealous.  Just joking.  Anyway, I'm off to eat a veggie burger and watch some television.  The Nanny is getting ready to come on.  Followed by Designing Women and then The Golden Girls.  Aunt Velma claims to have known I was gay for a long time.  If this doesn't prove her right I don't know what would?

       I heart Spring minus the bugs   I realized today that Spring is almost hear.  Considering it was 72 degrees today made it quite apparent.  However, sitting here at the computer I hear a buzzing and I know for sure that Spring is almost hear due to the constant buzzing of a housefly.  Actually, I don't think it's a housefly it's too big.  At any cost I'm typing really fast because I am a pussy when it comes to bugs.  Ewww...they make me want to run and cry like the Queen I really am.  I am starting to get used to myself without the mustache.  It is weird how much younger I look.  Most people say I look 28 or so with it.  I'm only 23 for fuck's sake.  Now I look my age.  Acting it is a different story.  Today at work we got a bonus.  Not that much but hey it will do.  It will pay for this weekends excursion to D.C. and buy the outfit I parade around in come Saturday night.  Lord help D.C. this weekend...my inner Dancing Queen has been bending over and touching her toes to get out on the dance floor to some hiphop music.  Not the techno/house music I've been exposed to over the past couple of outings.  Yeah the fly just swooped by my head.  It is almost time to go.  But before I do I have to let you all know it's Rafael's 20th birthday today!  Awww.  I rarely remember age old friends birthdays so how the hell did I remember his?  Go figure.

       Monday March 1, 2004   Creativity is so not my best asset today.  Hence the above title.  How creative.  My weekends have become too active.  Too active.  Aren't weekends supposed to be about relaxation?  Friday I left work at 430pm and did not get home until 430am.  Saturday I was up at 11am and managed to stay out until 330am.  Sunday (might I add my favorite of the days) I was up by 12pm and did not get home until 12am.    Why Sunday is my favorite?  Because Cheri and I met Michael in Winchester, VA to go shopping.  Hours of shopping, laughing, talking.  After shopping we headed to Books-a-million and had coffee while looking at "The Joy of Gay Sex."  Talk about a hot book.  Oh yeah it was hot.  Then Michael wanted to take myself and Cheri out to dinner.  So we headed to Ruby Tuesdays.  Food was okay.  The waiters and waitresses were fucking hot.  Oh yeah they were hot.  I have pictures of the hot waiters.  The evening ended when I gave Michael his St. Patrick's Day card that has a button that says "Kiss me I'm Irish."  And says "Screw that I'm just horny" on the inside.  He also got his new pair of earrings I thought would look good on him.  And the weird thing is is that he was talking about how he needed to buy a new pair of sterling silver earrings.  Am I psyhic or what?    P.S.  Did I mention I shaved my mustache?  Oops.

       Lost is my middle name   I at this very moment am so full of sadness.  Not the type of sadness where you just cry and sleep but the kind of sadness where you cannot sleep and your mind weighs so heavily on you that you feel nothing will make you happy again.  Not even next falls Prada. (Sorry there is a little humor in me).  I've lost him.  He said he needs time to deal with what I did.  You know the email situation.  This guy does not know how much he has done for me.  How much I love him.  How he was the first person to make me accept me for being gay and not being ashamed of it anymore.  I think about that night and how I could have not sent that email.  How all I had to do was let things be.  But how much I wanted to pay him back for all the good he had done for me.  The gifts I sent just weren't enough.  I wanted him to be happy and I thought I could help.  It turns out my act of love seems to have ended a friendship.    I just want to scream and cry for him.  I want to know that when he says he needs time that it is soon going to be over.  That he will be my friend again.  That ever since we met on line on December 29, 2003 will not just vanish.  I want to know that there are future memories and conversations with him.  I want him to know how much my heart is breaking.  How I am constantly thinking of him.  How I can't look at his picture.  How beautiful he really is.  I want to stop crying everytime I get on the computer and he is not there.  Stop crying everytime I know not to email him because he needs time.  I want him to be back in my life.  I want my Ralphy back.  I want the tears to stop just for a second to hear him calling on the phone or when I open his email.  I want him to know I love him and even if things never change I always will.

       And your point is?   I am hopelessly looking for other employment.  My job has become the mosting annoying thing in my life.  The pay is okay.  The coworkers are great.  But is it really worth it to want to drive off a bridge every morning so that you don't have to go back?  Maybe.  I haven't yet decided to take the plunge.  I have applied for 12 jobs in the past three days.  Hopefullly one of them will work out.  Otherwise, I am considering becoming a professional dragqueen.  And I can honestly say I don't think that career would benefit me either.  My point is:     I NEED ANOTHER FUCKING PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT BEFORE I GO POSTAL.   OMG.  OMG.  OMG.  I need therapy or a crack rock which ever is cheaper.

       Cruel Intentions   When someone decides to help a person who is caught in a catch 22 is there a way around the person lending the helping hand to not be in a catch 22 as well?  What started out as good intentions slowly morphed into an act of cruel intentions.  The thing is is that the person doing the lending of their hand still doesn't see how what was out of the kindness of their heart became a or is being seen as an act of trickery.  Am I so blind not to see the other standpoint?  No.  I played both scenarios in my head before taking action.  It just happens that the wrong one or the one I did not want to happened...happened.  Situation:  A friend of mine decided that he/she truly adored another person.  He/She decided to tell me about the person.  I found that person good for Mr/Mrs He/She.  Then he/she decided that they were not too sure of their standing with "the person being adored" and asked me to email then to find out "Do you consider He/She a friend?"  I took it upon myself to wait.  He/She tells me to not do it several days down the road and I don't.  Then I'm talking to He/She and their attitude is different and they are talking crazy over this person.  To the point where I am thinking they may do something drastic so that night I email "the person being adored."  The person I email gets annoyed and says that I'm prying for information that is none of my business and asks why I would even send an email in this nature?  I tell them I did it to protect my friend He/She.  I understand it is wrong but I'm just looking out for  friend who in no way is to blame for me sending the email.  I did this on my own accord.  The email receipient gets smart.  And argues but by the end of the conversation I have apologized for being "the friend who worried about He/She" and the answer "good enough" is the end of the conversation.  In the meantime, He/She is talking to me and I tattle on myself.  He/She gets mad but says that he/she can deal with it because I was just doing it to make sure He/She wasn't hurt.  Well this happened before the conversation with "email person/person being adored."  Well during the little typing touche I accidently confess that He/She "likes" Email Boy/Girl.  It just came out.  So I send the whole conversation to He/She and have yet to hear back from He/She.  And I am 174% devastated.  (*If you know who I'm talking about please don't say their names.)  So the whole situation baffles me.  He/She was in the catch 22 of if "I talk to this person I'm putting myself at risk to be disappointed" but "If I don't talk to this person than I'm not at risk."  I got tired of hearing the "I'm damned if I do talk and damned if I don't talk speech" and sent the email.  All I was expecting was a "it's none of your business" reply.  The I tell He/She the same thing I have been saying:  "You cannot rush someone into loving you.  It takes time.  You say this person does like you one minute then flip the script.  Give it time you are such a great man/woman and you have to give this person time to get to know you.  Things just don't happen overnight.  Unless you are a hooker."  Yeah the hooker part is just me trying to be funny about the whole situation.  So what started out as good intentions (and that's all they are) are being seen as cruel intentions.  I am lost.  And I never got to say goodbye.

       Yay Me   Saturday I have a date.  With whom you may be asking?  His name is Sumit (not summit....su-mit).  He is 26 lives in Annapolis, MD.  Am I nervous?  A little.    What I am truly worried about is is that me being sick will not clear up by the time I have to leave on Saturday afternoon.  And I really don't want to have to cancel.  Tell my sinus's to get better people and to stop making me do the thing that is gross that I don't want to say but I'll say it anyway so you don't think it's diaherrea...it's puking.  Oh my God.  Breathe.

       Weighing In   Today I feel like the steam building up inside of a pressure cooker.  Or the chicken...doesn't matter.  Can there possibly be more pressure put on one person to make them want to become a drug addict again?  Why yes, yes it can happen.  My mother calls me today and we have the following conversation.    Mom:  Don't be mad at what I have to say. Paul:  Okay. (in my head I'm thinking please just load the gun now.) Mom:  Dad called me and said that he watched the movie Gia. Paul:  Yeah.  What's the big deal? Mom:  Well he said that it was a crazy movie.  That there were people kissing in it.  Like from your norm kissing. Paul:  I know.  What is the big deal?  Why did he watch it anyway? Mom:  I don't know but he told me that the more he finds out about you the more he questions you.  He questions if he really knows who you are?  So I think it best if you don't say anything about going to Deer Park, Michael, W & G, or any other topic that is gay related because I really think he is starting to suspect something.  And I don't know if he can handle it.  I don't want this to pull our family apart. Paul:  Okay.  I'm not mad and I understand.  It's cool. Mom:  Are you sure? Paul:  Yes.  It's cool.  I'll see you when I get home.  So let's see...should I feel like there is more pressure on me?  Maybe.  Maybe I am reading into this more than I should.  Maybe I'll start reading history, or watch only the Spike network.  Maybe I will revamp my whole entire fucking life to please someone.  Maybe I will start playing sports and blech and drink a six pack of beer everynight.  Maybe I should just move away...get the fuck out of dodge.  To hear this bullshit is unnerving.  To have someone suspect something by the television or movies I watch.  I am interested in many things.  Gay, straight, bisexuality, animals, cars, decorating, shopping, fashion, music, art, cooking.  Why is it that only the "gay" aspect of what I like is seen when there is 9 million other things that make me...me?    Anyway,  today I came in and popped in W & G and my father brought me the phone.  He saw what was on the television, handed me the phone, and rolled his eyes, and proceeded to walk away.  I have this fear that he is going to ask again soon.  This time if he asks he will have to deal with the consequences of it.  If I have to move so be it.  If I lose him in my life, if I lose my mother in my life so be it.  If this breaks the family apart so be it.  I am tired of caring about what other people think when it comes to me.  Get the fuck over me.  I'm not that important.  Focus on yourself for once and analyze youself.  No worries.  If he asks and I say yes I hope I get to make another entry.  That is honestly what scares me the most.  Take from it what you will.

       Get the fuck out of town...   I just got back from Baltimore.  I miss that city so much it is disgusting.  The smell of cat piss in the alleys, broken glass from homeless bums broken in the street, litter...litter...litter.  The old people who have inhabited their houses for the past 60 years.  The pollution cloud that can be seen the morning sun.  The way it never seems to be dark out because of the city lights.  The sky is always a glow.  Plus the fact that my family lives there makes it even more unbearable to be away from.  That is why I visited this weekend.  It was fun.  There was laughing, cussing, shopping, and eating.  Memories.  Here is a picture of my grandmother in a church hat.  She is such a bad ass.     Enjoy.

       When good was named Snotty Puecockis   I woke up this morning.  The sun was shining.  I actually woke up early enough to take my time getting ready for work.  Then the realization that I had to puke kicked in and spoiled what was going to be a fabulous day.  I wound up not getting to work until 1030am...well actually 1033am.  And I realized that I want to go back to my old job.  I'm tired of working insurance fraud at Mamsi now known as United Health Care.  It is boring.  It does however, offer good company and the chance to bullshit about 4 out of the 8 hours I am there.  I called my old job and talked to Aleisa who is by far one of the sweetest woman I have ever known.  I am hoping that I get hired back on Monday.  Weird to think I will be going back for the third time.  I must really be destined to work there.  I hope that I get to go back.  Other than that everything else is going good.  Mom paid two cars payments for me.  I don't know why but she did.  I did not ask.  I am really a spoiled brat.  I used to not think I was but I realized when my father gave me the $300 for my Louis Vuitton wallet that I was a complete and udder titty baby who gets everything he wants.  And I am so grateful for that.  I just got done walking two miles.  It was great.  The wind was blowing, my back wasn't hurting and I barely broke a sweat.  And my list of fucking daily reading of the blogs list is getting out of control.  I need to stop linking off of others people's pages because pretty soon I'll be online for like 6 hours just reading journals.  I'm already on for like 2 hours reading and writing daily.  This addicition has got to stop.  Anyway, fuck rags I have a new link for your viewing pleasure.  This link is to one of the hottest guys in Ohio besides my love Patrick.  So go there or I will have him kick your ass because he is way taller than me.  He is 6'7".  I'm only 5'10".  Compared to him I'm a midget with a bad back.  Get to clickin bitches.  Introducing the one and the only " urlLink Shamus .  BTW, thanks for visting the my journal Shamus and for using the word FUCK!!!  Yahh...ha..ha.  I'm infecting everyone with potty mouth syndrome.  The world is now mine.  I probably won't be posting again until Monday because I'm headed to Baltimore tomorrow at around noonish.  So everyone please have tons of sex, drink much, and post more so that I have something to come home to.    And just because I'm not finished I give you:   Random thoughts and blabberings I had today at work...and said out loud   1. I feel so sorry for old people in their 70's because they will never be able to see all the new quarters. I mean they will never get to experience the new Hawaii quarter because they will probably be dead.  2. I hope you all know that this Details magazine I have with Nick Lashey on the cover is only used for mastubatory purposes. Please don't tell me you thought I bought it for the reading material. And look I'm very neat...no sticky pages.  3. If I could be anything in the world I would so be Jessica Simpson. However, I would not have been such a dick tease. I would have been the slut she had always wanted to be. Oh and did I just call her a thing?  4. I have gotten so bad at running stop lights and stop signs. It's like I went all color blind but still see color.  5. I wonder how many women have actually slammed their nipples in a desk drawer or closed them in a hard cover book? That's when you know your tits are just to much for one hand and one bra.

       Wine me, dine me, and then pay for the bill.   Please don't think I'm that lame to say "69 me."  But I just did so fuck you.  Anyway I came home and my fucking favorite number 69 was the amount of unread messages I had in my email.  I do and always feel special.  Thank you.  At work I thought I was going to have a fucking nervous breakdown.  Not that there was anything to be nervous about.  I was extremely bored.  Okay people I took paper clips and post-it notes and made action figures.  Pictures will follow.  More importantly I wore women's sunglasses and tons of curly glittery ribbon in my hair as I wanted to have long hair today.     Hence the picture.  This morning I talked about having sex with twins guys.  How hot is that.  Just because it was me saying that hot gay sex with Paul and his brother would be interesting doesn't mean I'm a whore.  Hello I've only slept with one guy in 23 years.  Granted I slept with him from 12 until 19 but one.  I really need to get out more.  And what is it with me and asian men these days.  I think Cheri got me started and now I'm finding that asian men are overlooked.   ASIAN MEN ARE FUCKING HOT!!   Cheri has always told me that once "You go asian you don't go caucasian."  I'm thinking that is true.    I managed to use the word "fuck" quite frequently today.  Usually I try to not use it at work.  And what you just read is a total fucking lie.  But if I had to guesstimate how many times it was used I'd have to say about 150 or more.  Yeah I have a really bad potty mouth.  Anyone who knows me that the word "what" is usually followed by "the fuck."    Like the first word that came out of my mouth this morning was...let me see...hmmm...FUCK.  It could be because I tripped over some big canister that was in the floor and twisted my goddamned ankle.  None the less I knew it was going to be a wonderful day.  So far I haven't found the wonder.  But I am full on pasta.    Time to go.  Walking again with my mother who has decided she is the next Richard Simmons.  Trying to motivate me and shit to walk.  What the fuck?  She is so paying my $172 cellphone bill.  P.S.  She called today to tell me she was so it's not like I'm giving her an order to do it.  Spoiled brat...nonetheless.

       Kaleidoscope   Today I decided that I needed to add some pictures to my site because I figure "a picture does last longer."  So here we go:     Me at work.  Notice that I'm not doing any?  Hello it's Happy 4/20 day!!      My home away from home.  Cubie in need of a doobie.     The back wall of my cubicle.  Notice the big Orlando Bloom poster.  And if they didn't know I was gay before...       Some of the magnents I have hung in the cubicle.  And I swear I'm not vain...really.     My favorite thing in my cubicle.  A wooden mouse sitting upon a Ritz cracker box.  How fucking cute?     My ride Sadie.     Sadie striking another pose.     A picture I took while driving home.     A picture of the mountains I pass as I go over the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers on my ride home.  Sorry the quality isn't wonderful but you try driving and taking pictures at the same time.  Aside from the pictures I was thinking today.  I was talking to Cheryl and she was asking about how many journals do I visit a day.  I wrote everyone down.  In order as they are on the my favorites list.  This is in no regard saying you are last on the list it just happens that I found you later on in life so you are further down the list because I don't know how to but them in any order.  Not that it matters.     urlLink Cyn  (B)  urlLink Tricia  (S)  urlLink Phil  (G)  urlLink Faustus  (G)  urlLink David  (G) Congrats on the house!!  urlLink Patrick my Love  (G)  urlLink Bob  (G)  urlLink Bill  (G)  urlLink Julie  (S)  urlLink Billy  (G)  urlLink Wayne a.ka. My Twin  (G)  urlLink Margaret Cho  (B)  urlLink No Milk  (G)  urlLink Christian or Mr. OnFy-yah  (G)  Notice the B/S/G's at the end of everyone's link.  Cheryl asked me how many were "gay" journals.  And I'd have to say over 90%.  This got me wondering.  Oh BTW:  B=bisexual S=straight G=gay  I wondered how it is that I read primarily gay/lesbian people's journals.  I mean it could be because of linking from page to page.  I don't know.  I know though that I am beyond comforted knowing this.  There aren't many gay people around here so at least reading makes me feel that I have friends just like me.  So big ups all of my bloggie buddies.  Thank you for starting and maintaining your life as a book for me to read.  Anyway, I am off for a walk.  My mother wants me to start walking with her.  I need the exercise anyway.  Plus the whole smoking thing.  Yeah that needs to stop.  Not just for me but because with the money I can save each week I can totally rock my  urlLink  Louie Vuitton  bag by next fall.    Oh just think of the possiblities.  Hope you enjoyed the pictures.  I may have more tomorrow if I feel the need to not work at work again.  One more thing:  Today I wore sandals. Now it appears to me that sandals would not make your feet lively with o de funk however, I was proven wrong. I took my sandal off for a split second and bam. Like a lightning bolt my nostrils were screaming to be sewed shut. Cheryl, my cubicle partner asked what was wrong. I held the sandal in the air and directed my fan toward her. She gagged. Choked. And then tears came to her eyes. My feet are death to small animals, a halt/cringe in fear force for humans. I am in need of Dr. Scholls. The carpet has even decided that it doesn't want me to walk on it and has peeled itself back so that it is safe. OMG, I'm not dirty. I take a shower twice a day. What the fuck is going on with my feet? This my dears is going to cause me to have to seek counseling. Not only do I have to spend $5 on some foot smelly stuff but the years of therapy ahead are going to cost me a fortune. I blame it on these god forsaken sandals. They are being trashed tonight.

       Trust me...I would never ever be a bad influence   Saturday night Michael, Cheri and I went to Deer Park to celebrate Cheri's 23rd birthday.  Usually, it is a boring time of just listening to god awful techno music for about 4 hours and drinking.  This weekend proved to be different.  We had a blast.  Well I mean it was a little bit my fault but that's besides the point.  I thought "Hey it is time to celebrate."  So I decided that everyone I was with needed to be tipsy.  I bought Cheri 4 Fuzzy Navels in about an hour time span.  I bought Michael 5 Long Island Iced Teas in about an hour.  I myself had 5 Long Islands, 3 Fuzzy Navels, and two shots of Absolut.  Let us just say that no one was feeling any pain.  So we are all having a great time dancing, talking, laughing.  I decide to go out to the car and call Rafael/Ralphy.  Plus I needed time to get sober before driving.  Now mind you I did not have more than a buzz.  I'm a pro and it would have taken about 8 or 9 more drinks to get me drunk.  So I buzz dialed Ralphy.  We talked for about an hour until Michael comes stumbling out of the club.  I had to help him to the car.  Cheri comes stumbling out of the club and gets in the car.  We head home.  Michael stayed the night at my house and my mother took Cheri home because I had a hella headache after sobering up.  I blame myself for Michael getting sick.  We had stopped at Sheetz before going home and Michael puked for around and hour and fifteen minutes while Cheri and I talked to Wagner and Matt.  Anywho, I didn't know Michael was such a light weight.  Really I didn't.  But he is feeling better today.  I helped take care of him on Sunday morning and afternoon to try to get him to feel better.  But trust me I didn't mean it.  So here is a picture of Michael and I must say it is so the best one I have of him yet.  You can see how wonderful he is:     He passed out in my hallway the next day because he couldn't make it back to my bed.  So I left him there until he woke up because I figure he was close to the bathroom and he looked so peaceful sleeping there.  That is why I have named him "Drunken Napkins Hidden Cutie."    By the way did I mention that I'm in love with Ralphy's voice.  He has such a sexy little voice.  I wish you all could hear it.  But I will keep it for myself.  Having Rafael as my friend is beyond wonderful if I haven't said so lately.  Oh and here is a new link my people to Christian's journal.  He is Rafael's friend who lives in NYC.  He is 22 and takes care of his nephew.  I wonder how long he has had him?  I'll have to ask.  But I'd like to get to know him from his journal first and then ask questions.  He also is a performer.  I hope he doesn't mind but Rafael sent me a song he sung and it was absolutely making me cry.  It is called "We Belong."  Yes I cried.  He has an awesome singing voice too.  Might I mention to that I have seen a picture of this guy and he is on fy-yah!!  So here is the link to  urlLink Christian's Page .  And here is my third journal:   urlLink LalaPaullooza .  I am sure this one will be a little more uninhibited.  By the way the page is totally ugly.  I'm working on formatting and stuff.  Plus I have to join to create my own style...and style my people I have.  And here is another nifty thrifty page of another HOT GUY... urlLink No Milk   I'm off to catch some zzzz's considering I haven't had many and I actually feel tired.  So I'm going to take advantage of not being ready to party but ready to crash for the evening.  Oh and it is totally 93 degrees in the WV today.  I'm am elated.

       Picture Day   So the picture you will see to your left is me.  I decided to finally come out of the closet and show myself without a mustache.  I think I look a little better.  At least Ralphy says so.  Anyway, I hope this picture doesn't scare any of my bloggier readers away.  I know I'm not attractive but I'd like to think I'm not as scary as a monster.

       Bust a nut   Yesterday a co-worker made the remark that the truth about me(Paul) is that I don't do any work while I'm at work.  I will not mention her name.  We shall call her Tellitub because she resembles a Tellytubby.  So the smart ass remark was left alone and I tried to move on.  This morning at work I made the decision to bust my balls from here on out and show her who the fuck she is messing with.  Now honestly I work.  I just take my time.  This way there isn't as much stress and I enjoy my time at work.  Somedays I slack off because you get tired of doing the same thing everyday.  Insurance Fraud is not all it is cracked up to be....believe me.  So to add salt to the wound she says today.  Tellitub: I don't know how you keep your idle time down so low when you don't do anything? Me:  Well considering that I've called 114 people so far I can't see why my idle time would be high?  I'm working. Tellitub:  Sure you are.  I know you are dialing disconnected numbers and staying on the line. Me:  Yeah that's exactly what I'm doing.  That's why I've spoke to around 40 members today. Tellitub:  Well it is good that you have it low because you don't work after lunch anyway. Me:  "I said and did absolutely nothing."  Idle time:  Based on 7 hours and 30 minutes.  You need to be a 65% or lower.  It is based off of how long you have been on the phone to how long the shift is.  So if you work 3 hrs to have a 50% idle time you would have to make enough phone calls to equal 1 hr 30minutes of talk time.  Contacting members:  Making contact and doing updates with insured's to see if there is any possible fraud on the account.  Now that you have had your lesson in vocabulary today let's move on.  So I had made the vow this morning to bust my ass and I did.  I will continue to do so.  Here is the good part.  My supervisor Jerry walks over to me and says "You have been on fire today.  You are doing better than anyone on the team."  And guess what Tellitub just happened to be standing by my cubicle.  Pissed off and red faced she stormed back to her cubicle.  She says she doesn't understand how I am a level 25 and she is only a level 22.  Guess what bitch because I came in as the shit and I'm getting the title back.  So if one more thing is said to me I'm taking it to the manager.  I don't feel I'm in the wrong because I don't disrespect her and worry about her performance so why should she do that to me.  She is only 19 and is the crankiest and moody girl I have ever met.  No wonder the doctor put her on Prozac.  I think he should throw in a couple of valium too.  But them I might ask her for one.  LOL.  Anywho, that is what my day has consisted of.  A bitch bitching about me and me working to the point of busting a nut.  But I did go shopping on lunch and bought three small flower arrangements for my cubilce, two candle holders, and a wooden carving of a mouse sitting on top of a Ritz cheese cracker box.  (I collect mice).  So yeah work was good but the shopping deals were even better.  50% off everything I bought.  But enough babbling I've got to take my movies back.  I rented LeatherHead and Cheaper by the Dozen.  To be perfectly honest with you CBTD as good but I only wanted to rent it to see Tom Welling and to see if he would take his shirt off.  I was disappointed because he only took it off with his back turned to the camera.  *tears*   OH MY GAA COULD HE BE ANY FUCKING HOTTER?  NO I DIDN'T THINK SO!

       Fuck the pepper...pass me the EPT   I feel like I'm either pregnant or on the rag.  I am emotional one second and a bitch the next.  Does our brain tell us to go through all of this?  If it does I wish that it would just set itself on one emotion a day.  I am so impatient today that it is driving me crazy.  I am becoming more impatient with not having a special someone in my life.  I think I'm going to hire a boyfriend in the meantime.  Yeah, I am not that desperate.  Anyway, I watched the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (new edition) last night.  It was okay.  You see I'm not that much on horror movies because when I watch them I tend to not want to sleep.  I already have enough problems sleeping and enough issues with the dark so there you go.  But I didn't even move last night.  I haven't had a full night's sleep in about 4 months.  I took 5 Tylenol PM's and bam knocked out.  I can't do that again.  Taking all the stuff is so not good for your kidneys.  But tonight I'm gonna just because I want to sleep so badly.  Back the the subject I didn't even dream about LeatherHead or whatever they call him.  He was ugly...ugly terrifies me but for some reason no nightmare.  LeatherHead is my newest best horror movie friend.  We are doing lunch next week.  I highlighted my hair last night.  It looks wonderful.  Or as Cheri would say "fantabulous."  I really think God built me wrong.  I think I was supposed to have brown hair with blonde highlights when I was put together but on that day the beauty shop was all out of that style wig-for-life.  So I must chemically torment my hair and make it how I see fit.  After all I am in control of my destiny.  And destiny just happens to like me with blonde highlights.  Well kids I smell chinese food so something must be brewing.  So consider me off like a prom dress.  P.S.  And no I have never worn a dress to a prom.  Only for Halloween.  LOL.

       Skippy the Happy Chow   Shrimp Chow Fooon is my favorite Chinese food at the moment.  However, it is hard to find around here.  Luckily, I asked the woman at Lotus if they could make it for me.  She asked "How you know about the chow foon."  I told her that my ex-fiance got me hooked on it.  I now have a place to order Shrimp Chow Foon from.  I am the happiest of campers.  I am so get lonely again.  Is it just me or do gay men prefer looks (which I am told I have) over personality?  I mean yeah I weigh more than Rosie O'Donnell...just kidding.  But I'm not ugly and from the right angle I think I look pretty hot.  Anyway, my point is is that all I ever see are hot men hooking up.  You know the eye candy guys.  I'm like you sluts have you even talked to the person you are sucking face with?  No I didn't think so.  Someone out there in bloggie world has to find me a damn man.  Please someone find me one.  Just one that's all I want.  He doesn't have to be god sent.  I like nice teeth and a good personality.  I'm getting so tired of trying to win Michael over that it is not even funny.  However, he did tell Cheri that she needed to make sure that I was asked to go to D.C. this Saturday because he wanted to see me and wanted me there.  Is it a sign?  Probably not but damn it I want to kiss..kiss...kiss him so bad I think that if I'm tipsy this weekend I just might grab him and do it.  Damn it I'm tired of being all submissive and shit when we go out.  I'm going to get what I want.    Tricia:  I got the ring back and took the fucking thing back.  If I hadn't of gotten it back "OH MY GAA" would have it have been on.  Bill and Patrick:  Since you both have an extensive collection of porn what would be your recommendation as a good one to purchase?  I'm thinking I want to buy one.  I'll just carry it in my messenger bag at all times is all.  Everyone else in the world:  When can you find me a man?    P.S.  Did I tell you all that I got my ears pierced?  Well I did.  They are healing still.  And I'm thinking of getting another hole in each ear.  Now that I know I'm not allergic to metals (cartilage reject 4 times) I'm turning into a freak.  But I'm not getting anything aside from my ears and possibly me labre pierced.  Tattoos and piercings...what next?

       Does your Tuna Taco need Sour Cream?   Conversation brought to you by Cheri, Missy, and Paul:  Paul(me):  Vagina's are weird.  I mean manhood is a different story.  You can put whipped cream and cherries all over it. Cheri:  Why can't you put whipped cream on a vagina? Missy:  And the boobs? Paul:  Well if you put whipped cream on a vagina it just reminds me of a really bad yeast infection.  And I have a rack of my own so why would I want to mess with someone else's? Cheri:  You know you like to decorate.  Think of it as an art project.  Why is it that I am always talking about vagina's at work.  Well I mean I was text messaging at work so it sort of is at work.  But I did use the word "Roast Beef Curtains" in a sentence today.  I think that is the worst slang for vagina.  Eww.  But like I said before vagina's are weird and when you draw the whole reproductive system you wind up with a moose head.    If I were a toad today I would be horny.  What is up with my sex drive these days.  I have one good dream and I do mean good about Michael and now I'm like okay I'm ready when you are.  That is why Satan invented porn.  For my viewing pleasure.  Actually porn makes me laugh.  However, it has to be noted that some porn is quite a turn on.  When you find one with the "model/eye candy" stars.  Ripplings abs, perfect teeth, no tan lines.    I don't own any porn.  I mean I have had magazines but they are at April's in my stash because Lord forbid I have it in the house.  Plus gay porno magazine in house=no need to come out to daddy.  So the question is posed:  How many of you own pornographic material? (I sort of own it but it is at another location)

       Vanishing....well sort of.   It has been quite a while since I have posted.  I have been really busy.  Between getting my emotions/sadness under control and work I have been quite busy.  I have talked to Cheri and somehow I am the one who has to regain her trust.  She said that what I wrote in the email to her broke her trust.  What the fuck ever.  I was mad she knows this and I told her that I was venting in the email.  She said that I have to earn her trust again.  Please I should be the one earning the trust back.  Hello the ring being bought...she let me buy it without telling me all of this.  So a friendship is still there I just don't see us ever being as close as before.    I really need a boyfriend.  To hell with a girlfriend.  I'm done with women.  And I know that a boyfriend would make me so much more happy because hello...gay boy here.  Yeah I fell for a girl but what I really need is to fall for a boy...not that I don't fall for many many men...it's just that they are taken or eye candy.  Anyway, I just got back from Virginia.  Bought tons of stuff with the grand my father gave me to mend the broken heart.  I will so have to take pictures of my room.  I have totally redone it.  New comforter, new flower arrangements, a cute baket/trashbin.  Oh it is just tooooooo much.  I'm in love with my room all over again.  Anyway, if you know a cute guy that you think I would or could possibly have a relationship with please feel free to let me know.  After all there aren't many men in WV that bat for my side.  Or have a killer decorating knack that can keep up with me.  I am so going to Cleveland to take Patrick up on that drink.

So thanks to those of you who have read my journal for so long.  It is just time for it to be kept private.  So long,  Paul

       This I want to remember...my last email   Cheri,  Hmm.  I'm wondering how to even start this but, it is already begun.  I know it is not your fault that I fell.  Some things just can't be controlled.  It is like telling the apple not to fall from the tree.  You can't stop it from happening.  But, do you honestly know how much I was in love with you?  Of course you don't because I knew it could never be returned.  For whatever reason that changed your mind it doesn't matter.  I offered you time but I knew that it would end up this way.  That you didn't think of it in terms as I had.  You said once that you would never lie to me.  That you would never say something that you didn't mean.  For some reason I doubt that.  I doubt a lot of things now.  I'll never truly know if the things we have talked about were sincere.  You can always say they were but something just tells me that they weren't.  I just don't think you know what you want.  I don't know if you ever will.  I would have given you the world if you would have asked.  Anything for my Cheri.  The one who made me for once feel like I was wanted.  The one who made me for once feel like I felt when I loved before.  When I told you today that the wall is built around my heart again it wasn't to make you upset or mad.  It has been done once.  It came down for you but I assure you that it is there again.  It will never love again.  Everytime I give my love to someone this is what happens and I'm just not willing to risk it again.  I am used to being alone and that is the way it will be from now on.  I have managed to neglect friendships and other relationships.  I will depend on me.  No one else.  Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I loved having you in my life for the period of time that I did but, like you said people are meant to have that time and that is all.  So tell Michael I'll miss his sense of humor and going out with him on the weekends.  Tell Missy I say hello.  Tell yourself to move on and and forget about me as does everyone else I've ever given my heart to.  Tell yourself that I'll love you no matter what but that it just isn't the same and having you in my life is a chapter that has ended when I shed my first tear for you today.  Tell yourself whatever it is that makes you feel better so that I know my heart is the only one hurting because hurting you is the last thing I would ever want to do.  Tell yourself that I loved you and while I can't forget about you I can have just that your memory and that Cheri is all I want.  Love you,  Paul

       Where to begin...   I am thinking that this will be my last journal entry.  Not because I don't like sharing bits and pieces of my life.  I have just realized that I don't want to remember everything.  I honestly don't want to remember anything.  I just don't want for anything anymore.  It has been fun for almost two years coming home every night and writing down little oddities and happenings that have occurred but, after today I don't want to remember them.  Cheri decided that she wasn't ready to get married.  I offered her as much time as she needed.  She said she needed more time by the way.  And I was told that she just wants to go back to being friends, "the way things were before."  I don't think she realizes how much I loved her, how my heart broke at work today when she told me.  How the wall that I let come down from around my heart has been rebuilt yet again in the matter of minutes.  How can she expect me to be her friend again?  I think the whole time she was feeding me bullshit.  Bullshit.  She told me once that whatever she told me was something that she meant.  She would have no reason to lie to me.  Well I can't say that I believe any of it.  She told me that she wouldn't of taken the ring if she didn't mean it.  She wouldn't have let me buy it if she didn't mean it.  Well that was all a lie to me.  She was so worried about after her surgery that she would change and I assured her that while her physical beauty may change for the better she would always be Cheri.  Well I think I was wrong.  Now that she is healed she is different.  She is arrogant, self-centered, cocky.  Things she never used to be.  I'm not mad at her.  I'm sad.  And what makes me feel even sadder is knowing that none of this upsets her.  None of it.  I am once again the fool led by music.  My heart is once again hidden and this time I assure you no matter how many "you shouldn't do that's" I hear it will never and I swear never be let open for another person to trample on again.  Get used to being alone is what I have told myself today because I have years of it ahead.  I am that person scorned and I'm not willing to let it go this time.

       WTF   So Cheri's ex-boyfriend R called Cheri today to inform her that I am just playing her.  He said that I have so many skeletons in my closet that I need to tell Cheri and that I am just using her to cover up for me being "a faggot."  Also to inform her that he better never see me or that "will be it."  Let me explain that R is Angel's (one of my close friends) brother.  He said that both Cheri and I can come see the kids however, I can only see them when he is not around.  I am asking myself "WHAT THE FUCK?"  I mean I know that it is making him jealous that I have Cheri's love and he doesn't but damn man.  Anyway, R is going to try to call here tonight to talk to me.  It's whatever.  He told Cheri that I am a very smart manipulator and that I am a puppet master that controlled him for a while when it came to Cheri.  Now his strings have been cut.  Does this boy sound psycho or what?    God my life is wonderful...I just love how people that I don't even know but on a "Hello there, how are you basis?" suddenly have so much to say about my life and want to become so involved.  I think I'll need a personal organizer for all the meetings I'll be having.  As of now it is R and Keith (another ex). I'm going to be so busy...how will I ever help plan the wedding?  Blog buddies I need suggestions...have at it.

       Blah Blah Blah   God being off of work I don't write much anymore.  I actually don't get on the computer too often either.  About once a week now if that.  Anyway, the back is doing better.  We all (Cheri, Missy, Michael, and I) went to my Aunt Velma's Pool Party today.  The weather sucked but thank god that my aunt's pool is heated.  They had the water up to 90 degrees.  It was absolutely fabulous.  The food was good.  Michael of course looked hot as hell in the Abercrombie shorts he bought yesterday.  Cheri was sizzling in her new white bikini that I had her buy.  Missy was whoa in her two piece.  Missy has a great body.  Anyway, other than the party I've done much of nothing but get more tests done.  I found out I don't have HIV.  Not that there is any reason for me to have it anyway.  We went shopping yesterday at Dulles.  Faboo!!  But anywho, I'm off to watch Deep Blue Sea for the 100th time.  Oh and I saw The Day After Tomorrow.  I would recommend to see it for the CGI but not for the story.  Oh and I ate at Ruby's that night and had fish.  I have met my 2 servings of fish for the year.  Yay me!!

       Some please tell me   What the hell is wrong with me.  I went and had all that testing done last week and I haven't heard anything yet.  I went for a walk yesterday along the river and now my back is shot.  I feel like my back wants to completely burst out of my skin.  I look a mess too.  I haven't shaved in like a week.  I am however, looking for another job.  I'm hoping that I get hired on soon somewhere else and that my health improves.  I have a party to go to this weekend at my Aunt Velma's.  Michael and Cheri and Missy are coming so I'm excited.  I just hope my back gets to feeling better so that I can enjoy this weekend, if not I will be totally disappointed.  Aside from sleeping and getting tests done I haven't done much of anything.  I don't eat much.  I don't do much of anything.  Hey I just said that didn't I?  Anyway, I'm going to try to get something to eat and lay down for a little while.  I hope that my back stops hurting soon.  I hope that everyone else out there is doing fine.  Sending lots of love...  Paul

       Lazy Daze   So I have managed to see a doctor or have a test done every day this week.  Monday was acupuncture, Tuesday was blood work, Wednesday was a bone scan.  Today is the first day that I haven't been to a doctor's appointment.  I was in a daze for most of today because I felt like I should be somewhere but I had nowhere to go.  My left arm looks like I have been shoting heroin because of all the needles I have been poked with.  I officially have track marks without ever running track or getting high off that which would give you tracks.  I was radioactive yesterday though when dye or something was shot in my to go through my bones for the scan.  I should have been dressed in one of those space suits or something.  I was afraid my cellphone would ignite me or something being all radioactive and all.  But, nothing happened.  It just made me pee a lot.  Other than that I am waiting to hear about my disability which has me freaking out because I do need money and I need time to get my immune system back in check.  Please let things work out so I get time off to get this done and get the money for the time I am off from work.  If not I will be living in a cardboard box.  I just don't know how I'm going to afford to buy the boxes for the house or the garage I'll need for my car.  And I'm so not into brown...I'm thinking red boxes...with black paper curtains.  That's right...I have too much time on my hands.  Night everyone.

       Feet of Stone   Last night I headed out to Baltimore to see my Aunt Velma and help her make a diaper cake that is actually made with diapers and baby stuff.  Also we were making shower favors.  I love making chocolate.  So I have redeemed my "doing of something stereotypically gay" card for the month.  Anyway on my way home I got a damn speeding ticket.  I was clocked going 87 in a 65.  But I was clocked 2421.3 ft away from the actual cop car.  What the fuck?  Anyway, I have to go to court to try to fight the damn thing.  It is a $275 fine and 5 points.  I hope that points don't transfer from Maryland to West Virginia if they don't let me out of the ticket.  I am buying a radar/laser detector.  I am feeling much better.  My mouth is still a little sore but that did not stop me from going to Rockville to China Canteen to get Shrimp Chow Foon...yummy indeed.  I spent almost $40 at the Asian Market.  I am falling in love with that place.  I bought guava juice, herb green tea, milk tea, some flowery tea, roasted duck (for my father), chopsticks, chow foon, Taiwanese candy and cookies, tea eggs, and some other things I can't think of but all in all I'm set for a while.  Other than making a diaper cake, chocolates, getting a speeding ticket, and eating/shopping asian style nothing has changed.  Oh...and...um...I'm going to write soon about what happened in the Blazer last Saturday night.  Let's just say it will take some courage to spill the beans on who was involved...I was there, Cheri was there, Michael was there, and another guy was there.  Out of the four two couldn't believe what they saw before them and the other two had fun.  What type of fun you will just have to wait to find out.  Lata people.

       Dull As Tombs   I have been confined to the house for about five days now.  I can guarantee I haven't smoked a pack of cigarettes this week.  I can also guarantee that this will probably drive me insane if I don't get out.  I am feeling better.  I have all my energy back and feel like the old Paul.  I am just waiting for something else to happen is all.  So tonight I may take in a movie or something of that nature just to get out of this thing I call home.    My only complaint is that my lips are still chapped and I have ulcers on my tongue still.  They hurt worse then the time I tripped over my own foot and busted my chin open.  And yes I'm exaggerating...but I did trip and bust my chin.  Other than watching television and DVD's I am bored.  And if you know me you know that I'm always up for watching a movie even if I have seen it 500 times.  However, my collection of around 800 DVD's and VHS's is so not appeasing me.  And the fact that MTV manages to repeat every episode of every show they have ever aired is a little annoying.  Match that with the same babble being broadcasted on CNN and you feel like you are in a bad episode of Quantum Leap except you leap and a continuous circle.    I think I may break out the flowers and make a new arrangement.  I haven't done anything stereotypically gay in a while.    P.S. Did I mention what happened in the backseat of my Blazer on the way back from club Cobalt last Saturday?

       Howdy People   So it has been a long time since I have written.  Much has changed.  Cheri and I took Michael out Saturday for his birthday to a club called Cobalt.  Good times were had.  Michael almost cried when we gave him his Louis Vuitton wallet.  The night was a complete success.  More importantly, my immune system has crashed again.  I have picked up some type of virus.  The only thing I know is that my mouth is on fire because of the virus.  I have all kinds of swelling and ulcers on my tongue.  Yay me.  I have to take a leave from work to try to get my immune system back in check.  It hasn't been the same since I have had back surgery.  They want to test me for HIV and all the other kinds of bullshit I know is impossible for me to have.  I had a sonogram on my gall bladder today because it may be defective.  Who knows?  I have to have all kinds of blood work done.  I'm not feeling very well.  Today is the first day I have gotten out of bed since Monday and that was only because I was forced to.  I am constantly tired now.  I don't eat.  And blah blah blah.  Basically, I feel like shit ran over.  I'm going on disability from work for about three months.  Life at the moment pretty much sucks.  But hopefully it will get better.  That is if I can ever get my immune system back again.  Without that I'm pretty much done.  I have some other things to write about but I really don't have the energy to at this point but I thought I would just keep everyone posted on my sorry ass.  Hope everyone is doing well.

       Three Questions   I'm getting this from  urlLink Shamus , who got this from  urlLink Patrick  who got this from Dorothy, who got this from Joe, who got it from someone else (I'm not researching any further than Joe...but feel free to take off where I left off. Let me know and I will post the links back to the creator of this idea.  3 Questions    I want everyone and anyone who reads this to ask me 3 questions, no more no less. Ask me anything you want and I will truthfully answer it. Then, I want you to go to your blog, copy and paste this allowing your friends (including myself) to ask you anything.  Jesus Christ I can't wait to see what this brings.  Anywho,  Little Miss Vengence as Shamus has so politely titled me had a boring and I mean a "could someone please hand me a sharpened knife or rope so that I can end this day" day.  Oh but wait what did Jerry ask this morning?  Jerry:  So how is life Paul? Paul:  Up until now it has been pretty fabulous and I just now asked myself if I could trade it in for another one.    Is this man an absolute idiot.  He laughs and tells me that I only get one and to make the most of it.  Hello...I said up until now...that means when you entered it it was shot to shit.  Being a bitch is such a total blast but when your supervisor is so oblivious to things you question your own ability to be a bitch.  I feel like I should change my name to Anya from Buffy the Vampire Slayer because she was a vengence demon....well on men anyway.  And Jerry is a man or he is the ugliest most prettyful monster.  What will tomorrow bring?  Hopefully, a Mercedes full of hot guys wanting to worship me.  But I am not going to hold my breath.  I wore killer shoes today people.  The type of shoes that make me 6" tall and I'm only 5'10".  Compliments were given throughout the day on how fabulous they are.  Needless to say those comments didn't help when I tripped on the carpet and fell because the bitches weigh like 3 pounds each.  Damn fashion...no that is blasphemy...damn the carpet I tripped on.  More importantly, Shamus I wouldn't mind you working over me it would just depend on what you were doing.  *wink*

       Back in the habit   And no I don't mean I'm trying to become a nun again.  Today at work I had the most uplifting and positive thought.  I am going to reclaim my Queen/Queer Bitch tiara back.  You see my supervisor Jerry a.k.a. Peppy LaPew (due to the skunky hair) has it out for me.  I think it may be because he asked me what kind of person I was and I told him honest.  He then said "Well since you are an honest person do you think there is something I could change about myself to become more positive in our team."  I told him:  "I'm glad you asked that Jerry.  I think you could change your attitude.  You may be a supervisor but you walk no higher than us (referring to my coworkers).  You talk no better than us.  And yes Jerry I know for a fact that my vocabulary is more advanced than yours.  Yet you still walk around this building thinking you are better than us.  Just because we are under you doesn't mean that you can tread on us.  If you think that we are afraid to yell back you are wrong.  So come down off your high horse and let us know that you walk with us not against us."  So now I know he is plotting my demise.  Bastard.  What he should be plotting is a fucking opportunity to get his hair colored.  Anyway, that is beside the point.  My point is:  I'm going to be a bigger bitch than his wife.  I don't kill people with kindness because I'm not kind.  I am a manipulative, heartless bastard who owns up to the middle name Vengence.  Actually I'm fuckin with ya.  I'm a sweetheart.  Really.  But anyway, the first thing I did this morning was not answer his question.  He repeated himself about 4 times and then I turned around and said "Oh I didn't have anything to say.  Why did you keep asking me the same question?"  And then when he asked why I didn't have any member contact yesterday I said "Because I didn't.  The paper answers all of your questions.  It's there in black and white Jerry or do you need me to highlight it?"  He thought it was a joke and started laughing.  I looked at him and made a phonecall.  So yeah it is so much fun at work now.  I can't wait to go in tomorrow.

       Smitten Kitten   So Saturday was a blast.  Michael and I spent 5 hours shopping.  We bought some killer powfits(if you don't know don't ask) and then headed to see Godsend.  I was quite impressed with the movie.  Actually, being the pussy that I am anything that has a possessed child in it pretty much scares the living hell out of me.  After the movie Michael and I headed to DuClaw for dinner.  That too was utterly fantabulous.  Anyway, this weekend is Michael's birthday.  Cheri and I are getting Michael  urlLink this .  I really think he will like it.  Plus we will all now have Louis'.  Sunday Cheri and I headed to Rockville to the Asian Market.  Let me just tell you I'm in love.  I bought Guava Juice, Milk Tea, Tea Eggs, Snow Peas and some desserts.  We had ate lunch at the China Canteen earlier.  Then we headed to The Promenade to go see Mean Girls.  Is it bad that the movie so reminds both of us of ourselves when we were in high school?  And I have to say that being a snotty bitch doesn't look that bad on the big screen.  I am in love with the damn movie.  I am such a girl.  Ralphy has yet to communicate with me.  He is online now and not a message has been typed.  I miss him so much.  And yes I'm still crying about it.  Anyway, I just wanted to give a quick update for you all on why I've neglected you and to remember how fabulous my weekend was years from now.  Also, I am really really digging Michael.  And the thing is it is making me mad that I'm letting someone effect me this way again.  I just hope the feelings can eventually be returned.

       Cravin'   Yesterday I went out to dinner with a few people and something unexpected happened.  I couldn't believe it was happening.  I was so ashamed.  So embarassed.  So confused.  I knew I was wrong for it.  Confession:  I really wanted to order a steak.  No please understand I haven't eaten  or craved red meat in a long long time.  And to be like "Oh please throw me a steak on and burn it!"  Well that just completely floored me.  I'm wondering how it is I'm craving a steak and I can't remember what steak tastes like.  Hello.  What the fuck is up?  Needless to say I had sauteed zucchini, a spring mix salad, and cheesecake.  And by the time I got finished my 4th margarita it was all a craving of the past.  Until I woke up this morning and remember the sin I committed last night.  I'm going to pick Michael up.  I'm going shopping.  Then to the movies.  And what I really wish would be to go back to his room.  But I'll settle for a hotel.  Just kidding.

       Flight of Fancy   On my way to work tonight I listened to the song "Echo" by the band Trapt.  It reminded me off Summer.  You know the girl who I loved to no end and would eventually break my heart.  Then I wondered if the impact she had on me made me trust women in general less.  Was I that scorned that it plays a part in my perception of a relationship with a woman can truly be?  I don't know.  I know who I am.  I am extremely comfortable with my sexuality now but I have to wonder if she had anything to do with me turning out the way I have.  I have always kept females close to me as friends.  I can't say I have ever let anyone in as much as I did with Summer.  It is like I already know how it will turn out if I do let them in.  That is why I choose not to let people get too close to me.  With Cheri it is a different story.  She honestly is my missing link.  We finish and compliment each other.  But, I do realize that it is better to remain friends.  That way there is no reason for us to ever become separated due to some stupid argument that generally happens in a relationship.  People (especially April and Erin) told me that I have to let go of Summer.  But, it just isn't that easy.  Let's see it has been about 4 years since I last saw her but I still think of her often.  Maybe it is because she was my first love or maybe it is because she hurt me so bad that I just can't push her out of my mind.  Whatever the case I need to start forgetting about the past and worry about what lies ahead in the future.  Just a thought.  Night everyone.

       I would rock your world but you're just too ugly   I have no clue what it is but on the way home everyday I think I have managed to see the prettiest monsters commuting to and from.  Hello monsters are only supposed to come out at night.  Wait a minute...I work at night but I'm certainly foxy.  At least I have sexy ass eyes that most people cannot compete with.  Michael asked me if I wore mascara and curled my eyelashes because I have beautiful eyes.  I was like "Sahh...Tsk...No...Oh..my...gaa...natural."  If that doesn't scream queen then I don't know what does.  But I must say that if I wear eyeliner my eyes are even more stunning.  I could melt you with them.  Just kidding.  I can only undress you with them.  Anyway, back to the subject.  This lady was following ever so closely to me on the way home and she was applying make-up.  All I wanted to say to her was that I didn't think Covergirl, MaxFactor, Clinique, Wet n Wild, or anything other brand of facial crayon was going to improve what is already horrendous and/or permanenetly fucked up by nature.  It's just not possible.  I wish I could have applied for her to be on The Swan.  But then I would be afraid she would just turn out looking like an Ostrich.  Or better yet...an ugly duckling...yahh..haa...ha.  Yeah I realize it wasn't funny.  But seriously if you know you are ugly wear a mask.  It is the only thing that shields my beautiful eyes from your ugly face.  Oh that is really mean.  But hey I'm aloud to say it.  That is why I only surround myself with beautiful people.  Or people I think are attractive.  Not that I think I'm God's gift to the world but hey I'm not bad at all.  I'm mysterious looking when I have black hair.  With blonde I'm exactly that...a ditzbag.  Any...time to run.

       Weekend Recap   This weekend was wonderful.  Yeah wonderful.  Shopping Saturday for seven hours at Dulles Town Center and then the Leesburg outlets.  I only spent $250 Saturday which is surprising.  I got like 28 candles from Yankee Candle Company for twenty bucks and a holder.  I went to Abercrombie and Fitch and purchased some underwear for like $50 for three pair.  They are quite comfortable.  I don't even know that they are there.  At Hecht's I managed to find a pair of scandals that I actually like by Steve Madden for only a whopping $40.  Let's see...I headed to SunCoast Video and bought "The Seven Year Itch" and "Mrs. Winterbourne."  At HotTopic I bought a new shirt that says "Sorry, I don't do girls."  It was a good investment for only twenty.  Then Michael and I headed to T.G.I.F.'s for some dinner.  It was yummy.  Then we went to the outlets where I got my fourth new watch in 6 monhts.  It is by Kenneth Cole Reaction.  I love it.  It has a leather band that is a khaki color with a matching face.  It was on sale for $40.  Then after Michael bought out Kenneth Cole spending almost $400 we headed to Calvin Klein.  I didn't buy a damn thing.  I figured I was at my limit for the day.  Got home about 1100pm and went to bed.  Sunday I got up at around 1pm and headed to Martinsburg to meet Cheri and Missy.  We went to dinner at Empire China where Cheri's mom works.  The food was great.  It was Cheri's treat and I am very greatful.  Then she took us to the movies to see "White Chicks."  Umm...hello...did that movie so not represent Cheri and I?  It so did.  Then we went to WalMart where I made several purchases.  I got "Gothika," "Beyond Borders," and "Can't Buy Me Love."  So allergy medicine and so Got2B spiking gel.  Yeah there went another $85.  But now I'm at work.  Not too busy.  Still loving the job.  Vacay starts Friday morning after I get off work.  The parentals are giving me like $300 so spend down there.  Yee-haw.  Other than that everything is going good.  My fat ass has managed to lose 12lbs since starting here and I hope to continue.  It is because I don't eat.  But hey starvation could be the new "in" thing for dieting.  Well gotta go do some work.  Keeping up with these truck drivers and such can be quite taxing.  Later.

       Whoa there...   I actually am updating my journal before I get home.  Jesus Christ I can't believe it.  I am quite tired.  Hence, the lack of sleep mentioned earlier.  But it will be okay.  Plans have shifted for today...shopping is still on but Cheri, Missy, Michael and I are probably going out tonight.  I hope that I have enough energy stored to make it through the whole day and then be able to last at night.  I know I'll be pushing it but hey it's not like I get to go out every weekend.  Anywho, I shall post if anything interesting happens this weekend.  Chao!!

       Suck on this exhaustion   So like I have said a trillion times before I do not sleep all that well.  Actually when I fall asleep I sleep.  It is the whole "trying to fall asleep" thing that is the problem.  Let's see I took three shots of NyQuil and two sleeping pills and bam three hours later I was finally tired.  Four hours of sleep later and I'm up watching my BVS DVD's.  I have tried so much shit to try to get me to sleep but none of them seem to work.  Sleeping aids, teas, herbs, crack...well maybe not crack because that has the opposite effect but you never know.  Anywho, I've got to get ready for work in about 45 mins and I'm still wide awake.  I thought hey lay down for an hour and take a power nap.  Yeah that lasted all of 4 mins and I was up and now on the computer.  What to do?  What to do?  Hopefully, I will be tired by the a.m. because Michael will be here by 1230 tomorrow to go shopping.  And we all know that one thing that keeps me awake is spending money for gifts for myself.  Anyway, if you have any suggestions please feel free to drop me a note.  I'm off to burn a CD for work tonight and then watch another epidsode of BVS before getting a shower.  Later Bitches.

       Hideho Motherfuckers   Yeah I know I have been neglecting the journal. But hey when you work from 10pm-7am without a break you are quite tired when you get home.  Plus I watch the reruns of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in the morning from 730 to 9.  I know I've seen them all before but but but...I need to see them again. And I mean yeah I could watch my DVD's but hey it's on t.v. when I'm lying in bed trying to relax.  Work kicks ass.  This job is a fucking blast.  Plus there are some hot truckers to look at throughout the night so I'm game.  Let's see what has been going on.  Yesterday I had my second round of acupuncture.  They put one of the needles in wrong and I about chopped the doctor's fucking head off.  But other than that it didn't work as well this time.  I went to the doctor today for my allergies.  Other than that I have been staying home and doing much of nothing.  This past Saturday I went shopping and stayed up from Friday night at 8pm until 11pm Saturday night.  I got the newest release of BVS.  The 6th season.  I love it.  I love when Willow because the oober witch.  She rocks.  If only I could manage something like that the world would be such a better place to live.  Well it's 4pm and I really need to get some sleep before I have to get up at 830 so I better scoot.  Oh but before I go Baby Girl (my pet rat) has this huge ass cage that you think she would be content with but no no no.  She has managed to somehow knaw through the floor of it.  Hello hard plastic here.  How the hell did you manage that one my love.  Anyway we had to put a cookie sheet underneath it so she could get out.  She is such a scheming bitch.  She wants to run the house all night and that just isn't going to happen because I'm sure that there would be much diaster to awake to.    Anyway, going shopping Saturday with Michael.  Going out with Dad to the movies Sunday to see the Stepford Wives.  Working the week and then I'm on vacation for five days.  Yippy K.Y. Jelly baby...I can't wait to shop!!

       Neglect   I fell as though I have been neglecting my journal.  I don't write in it everyday like I used to when I work banker's hours.  Now it is more like a chore to come down to the computer and write.  Not that I don't enjoy it but I'm so tired when I get home that I don't feel like typing.  Plus the fact that I type all night at work makes me not want to type when I get home.  But I'm going to try to get myself on a new ritual when I come home from work.  I will be to take a shower, get something to eat/drink, and then head to the computer to check my emails/journals and hopefully if I'm not falling asleep write in my own.  I haven't really been reading journals lately.  Where at one point I found myself addicted to reading journals I don't have that craving anymore.  I guess that working vampire hours has its negatives too.  I am a nightowl so that is the positive.  The job is interesting.  The people I work with not that there are many are too funny.  (They love to curse just as much as yours truly).  But, nothing that journal worthy happens there and being on a computer all night sort of makes me want to shy away from the use of a computer when I get home.  I have managed however to read my friend Amanda's journal everyday.  I love the way that she writes.  She has always been a kick ass writer.  Since we had English 101 together about 6 years ago.  She is a person who writes wonderfully non-fiction wise whereas, I am a person that writes incredible fiction.  Anywho, so let it be known that, yes, I will start reading everyone's journals again daily and attempt to fill my journal pages with something remotely interesting everyday.  Until tomorrow morning at around 7:35am...  Nighty...night....well morney...morn...hey it's the best I could do on about 4 hours of sleep.

       So much Pride so little time   Well we didn't make it to pride this weekend in D.C.  Actually we didn't make it anywhere.  Next weekend however, is going to be a different story.  We will be on a shopping escapade in D.C.   We were all too tired to go anywhere this weekend.  I slept from 10am Saturday morning until midnight.  That is how exhausted I was from working overtime and just being on third shift this week.  However, I love third shift and could not ask for a better shift.  The only excursion that I had this weekend was tonight with Cheri.  I had gone up to April's house to hang out and we decided to go to WalMart.  Cheri met us there and we headed to Rockville to get some shrimp chow foon.  Other than that I haven't done much of anything.  I am tired now but I have to stay up later so that I'm not up all day tomorrow seeing that I have to work third shift from now on.  Staying up all day will not be beneficial to my work schedule.  I have to stay up until at least 3-4am so that I can sleep in the afternoon to the evening tomorrow.  Anyway, vacation is coming up in two weeks.  My parents, Michael, Cheri and I are headed to Williamsburg for four days.  I can't wait.  When the three of us are together that is when I am the happiest.  Plus The Williamsburg Pottery is there which make everything worth my while.  That is my favorite part of the vacation...The Pottery.  They have so much unique stuff that you can't find around here.  Plus I like baskets for some odd reason and they have around 5 or 6 thousand baskets to choose from there.  I also like going to Busch Gardens and seeing the shows and also the shops.  They have great stuff too believe it or not.  I mean you wouldn't think that an amusement park would have great stuff but they in fact do.  I especially love the purchases that can be made in Ireland part of the park.  They have such beautiful things.  I'm a celtic junkie.  I love celtic knots and the such so that is heaven to me.  Oh and by the way I don't think that Michael and Cheri are getting me my Louis Vuitton change holder as I so much wanted for my birthday.  They said that they had something much more super de dooper for me than the likes of Louis so I can't wait to find out what it could possibly be.  However, in other Louis Vuitton related news I will be getting my LV Bookbag in about a month.  Seeing as I am making about 200 more dollars a week at my new job my dream bag is only a couple of hundred dollars away.  Yay yay yay!!!!!!!!  When I get it there will be a picture.  Of the bag and of the big grin I will have across my face.    P.S.  My family and friends are making me so happy at the current time that I couldn't ask for anything more.  The Louis Vuitton bookbag is just an added bonus to fill my materialistic side.  I try to suppress it but for some reason when I do that it comes back with more vengence so I try to fill it every week so that I don't want for too much when I don't.  Hope everyone had a great time at Pride across the country.  I will be going for sure next year.  Love ya'll!!

       Biz ziz ziz zay   Work was hell last night.  We were extremely backed up on the route packets for the drivers.  Our drivers are supposed to be out on the road by 3am no later.  Well some of them didn't get to leave until about 430am.  And I am not to blame thank you very much.  Johannes and I busted our asses to get caught up.  Kim stayed after for four hours to help.  But by the end of the night (it would now be my morning) we were caught up but we will see what happens when Ford gets there report and we so did not make a 99% on time rate.  We are blaming it on the shipping company.  They sent us three loads that were supposed to be sent out the previous night last night so that is what fucked everything up.  Can't people fucking be on time for once?  Huh?  Is it that impossible?  I'm always on time to work actually, at least 15-20 minutes early but that's because I'm perfect.  Just joking.  Needed that little vanity today to make life worth living.  LOL  Well tomorrow's just another day...tonight however I'm hoping will be a different story.  P.S.  Thanks for the comments Amanda.  I'll have to come up one night and get your template filled with links and shit.  Maybe I can come up Sunday afternoon around 2 or something.  Call my cellphone and leave a message to let me know if that would be cool.  Later Girl!!

       Good Morning   Well it is around 830am and I am wide awake.  I find it harder and harder to sleep when I come in at 8am.  Working from 10pm until 7am flys by however.  Working for a trucking company kicks ass as far as I am concerned.  And yeah there are actually some hot looking truck drivers that come in and out of there.  One's name is Shannon...and he is very gorgeous.  I do the computer coding for the drivers that gets sent to Ford so that they see everything is being shipped and delivered correctly.  I get to track where each and everyone of my drivers is all night.  They are never slick enough to hide!!!  Amanda,  I'm not sure how to respond to the email that you sent.  I guess it is just harder having someone as a friend that I never get to see.  It is not that I don't think about you and the kids and Billy because I do.  I guess our lives have just moved in such totally different directions that it has had me neglect our friendship.  Believe me I never meant to push our friendship to the side it just sort of happened without me even realizing it.  So I'm going to try harder to keep in touch with you.  If it is only through email since we are on totally different schedules than I'm hoping that will do for now.  Tell Billy and the kids I say hello.  Hope to hear from you soon.  P.S. I added you to my links!!!  Well I'm off to get a shower and grab something to eat since I haven't eaten in three days.  Did I mention that I'm so busy at work that I don't eat.  Yeah...I just remember that I need to eat.  I haven't ate since Sunday night.    And Constance...Michael, Cheri and I are headed to Pride in D.C. this weekend.  Thanks for the birthday wish.  You too Tricia...hope everything is going good at work and with the kid!!

       Hello there my people   Saturday night was a blast.  Michael, Cheri, Missy and I went to dinner at Ramano's Macaroni Grill.  And why did all of us flirt with our waitress Danita.  She was wonderful.  The food was wonderful.  And we laughed our asses off.  Then we headed to Deer Park.  We got there a couple minutes before midnight (the real birthday day). It was pretty packed.  I didn't even drink.  But I did dance with Michael...that made my birthday all the more better.  Sunday I did nothing.  And when I mean nothing I mean did not get out of bed.  That was until Cheri came over with the second installment of my birthday present.  Saturday was Miracle by Lancome from Michael, Godiva Liquer Truffles from Cheri.  Sunday was three roses and some purple flowers (each rose was one of them M, M, C) and a balloon with Happy Birthday written on it.  The third installment I get this upcoming Saturday.  And I'm pretty sure it is my Louis Vuitton change purse.  Actually, I know it is.  This weekend we are headed to Pride in D.C.  We are leaving to go Saturday night.  I mean we have to go later because Michael and I don't get off until 7am Saturday morning.  We are staying the night and then going all day Sunday.  It should be fun.  Anyway, I've got to get some sleep for work tonight.  I've got to be up at 830 and it's 430 now.  So I'll write later.  P.S. Thank you so much for the birthday wish Manieka!!!!!!!!!!

       Double shot   I went for a job interview yesterday expecting to get hired.  What I didn't expect would be that I would start that night.  I am now working for Schneider Trucking Company.  I do computer work, coding, spreadsheets...stuff that I'm interested in.  It is based off of daily routes that the truckers use and I have to talk to them all night to get all kinds of information and crap to plug into the spreadsheets so that METRICS is 99% or higher.  I kick ass so far.  I have been up since yesterday at 10am and have yet to sleep.  I'm getting some water, smoking a cigarette, and hitting the sack.  I have to be in at 10pm so I figure getting to sleep by 2pm will suffice.  Wish me luck my people.  This job is super cool!!  Oh and just as a reminder someone's special day is coming up on Sunday.  If I don't get a chance to write it is because I will have locked myself away at the thought of being 24.  I think I will start being reborn to 23 ever June 6th from this one forth.

       I'll never understand...     Sometimes I think that it is great to enjoy work. At other times I think that I could go postal and kill all the people that I fucking work with. Working with a bunch of guys is very taxing. Actually, I'd trade almost all of them in for females. While other females think that other females are bitches and blah blah blah I don't. They are the only people that I have actually been ablet to relate to. It is like they accept me for who I am and they don't question me or my personality. It has been that way since I was in school.  At work tonight I was iming with Ralphy and of course it had to be on my phone because this computer doesn't allow software to be downloaded. When a new message would come in the phone would make a sound that is one of the ringers. Well everyone thought it would be funny to name that tone a call to the mothership. It is not like it is a big deal but they kept on constanly nagging me about the tone making fun of it. I'm like what the fuck is your deal. Grow the fuck up and get over it. Guys are fucking so immature. That is why I don't have many male friends...if you can say that I have any at all. So I finally decided to call Ralphy and talk to him over the phone because I knew it would be easier. It was and I'm glad that I got to talk to him tonight. I wish I lived near him....he is such an awesome person.  At any rate I have work to do but I just needed to bitch a little before I went off the handle and fucking said something that I don't need to say. And we all know how bad my mouth is when I get pissed off....let alone my temper.  Night all.  P.S. One reason I would never become a truck driver and I have thought about this for some reason. All they talk about is women and the routes that they run. Get a fucking life....PLEASE!  P.S.S.  Shannon one of the drivers just threw something at me and hit me in the head telling me to stop surfing the net and get to work.  Monday he may have flat tires.  If he plays his cards right...I may put stricnine in his coffee.  No really!!

       Burn Out     I survived until 7a.m. this morning.  I didn't think that I would make it through work last night.  It was one of the most hectic nights we have had in a long time.  I'm hope tonight does not offer a repeat performance.  I was heading to Baltimore in the a.m. but, I think that I may just wait until next weekend.  April has invited me to go camping tomorrow night.  And please note that I have never been camping.  Me doing this is like Paris and Nicole heading out in last seasons The Simple Life...it is a very foreign territory.  I actually asked April is there was electricity where we would be going.  She of course replies with that word that makes me cringe...."NO."  How are you supposed to do your hair, watch television, cook, and above all surf the net?   Thank God for modern living.

       Truth Be Told     &nbsp;  When I was younger the thought of sex never really crossed my mind.&nbsp; When I finally realized what sex was I was about 11 years old.&nbsp; It then did not really hold any fascination.&nbsp; But then I was involved in a game of Truth or Dare.&nbsp; This game can be quite fun if you play it correctly.&nbsp; I was dared to kiss a boy.&nbsp; I couldn't believe someone would actually dare me to do this.&nbsp; Should I? Shouldn't I?&nbsp; That played in my mind for about two seconds and then I decided to do it.&nbsp; I was 11 when I had my first real kiss and it was with a boy named Chris.&nbsp; Little did I know that I would spend 9 years of my life being devoted to him.&nbsp; Giving him my mind, time, and my virginity.&nbsp; I was 12 at that point.&nbsp; Sometimes I regret being so young and having sex but then I think of all the times we played this out and how happy he made me.&nbsp; I wish I knew where he was.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   urlLink  100 Things About Me .&nbsp; I got bored at work and did this.

       The Early Bird Doesn't Eat Worms    &nbsp; So I had to come to work early again tonight.&nbsp; I am the early bird.&nbsp; However, I only eat chicken and vegetables and some soy based products.&nbsp;   Work so far has been slow.&nbsp; I'm reading "Interview With The Vampire" for the fourth time.&nbsp; I finished "Tale of the Body Theif" the other night.&nbsp; I so love IWTV.&nbsp; It is probably my favorite book next to "The Broken Diaries" and anything by William Shakespeare.&nbsp; But enough I'm out for now to read and eat some Chick-Fil-A.&nbsp; I'll post more tonight.

       Sheerah&nbsp;vs. Sheerah     &nbsp;  When I was&nbsp;a child I used to spend a lot of my time at either my Aunt Velma's or my Aunt Cathy's.&nbsp; At my Aunt Velma's I was treated like an adult and my aunt indirectly molded me into the person that I am today.&nbsp; This was due to spending so much time with her and my Uncle Keith.&nbsp; I miss those days.&nbsp; Any other time I was away from the house I was at my Aunt Cathy's because that is where my two cousins lived:&nbsp; Stacy and Allen.&nbsp; Here I was just that a child.&nbsp; This is where my imagination flowed and hours of playing ensued.&nbsp; I had boat loads of fun when I was there.&nbsp; Stacy and I would play Barbies for hours and hours on end.&nbsp; When my Aunt would come home she would always yell at us for me playing Barbies with Stacy.&nbsp; Like it had some weird affect on me.&nbsp; I wasn't supposed to play with dolls.&nbsp; Nonetheless, she would let us continue to play.&nbsp; Secretly I think she knew as did my Aunt Velma of the boy who played with dolls.&nbsp; It would upset me that playing with Stacy and her dolls was such a big deal.&nbsp; I mean it is a toy.&nbsp; Nothing more.&nbsp; Regardless of if I had permission or not I would play with them anyway.&nbsp; Oh but what memories I have of being there with Stacy, myself, and the bundles Barbies and accessories.&nbsp; On the rare occassion that Stacy and I lent ourselves to play with Allen we would be most creative.&nbsp; Creating haunted houses in the basement, making forts out of sofa cushions, sheets, and yardsticks, and above all we always pretended to be superheros.&nbsp; Allen would sometimes be a G.I. Joe, pirate or Heman.&nbsp; Yes, that is what he was most of all.&nbsp; Heman.&nbsp; Stacy would pretend to be a damsil in distress, a princess with the ability to alter reality or see the future, and above all characters to be she would pick Sheerah.&nbsp; This is where the problem occurred.&nbsp; You see I would play that hero's foe, an evil king, an imp or fairy (no really!!).&nbsp; But above all I wanted to be Sheerah.&nbsp; We would settle the disputes over who could play who and move on.&nbsp; I would usually be told the same thing "You're not a girl so you can't be Sheerah."&nbsp; With imagination still comes a touch of reality.&nbsp; Then it came to the point of the last straw being broke.   When the Heman movie came out on video it just so happened that my Aunt Cathy was having a party so everyone was together and to keep us youngin's occupied we had the movie.&nbsp; Stacy, Allen and I headed to the basement with blankets, pillows, snacks, and our action figures in hand.&nbsp; We began watching the movie.&nbsp; Allen was the first to say that he was Heman (which is totally a closted homosexual character), Stacy and I were the last to pick characters.&nbsp; Stacy kept telling me she couldn't decide between Skeletor and Sheerah.&nbsp; I knew I wanted to be Sheerah but didn't say anything at first.&nbsp; When I finally spoke up it was followed by "No I'm Sheerah.&nbsp; You have to be Skeletor."&nbsp; At this point my blood began to boil at being told "no" again by Stacy and Allen.&nbsp; We bickered back and forth for about two or three minutes and then began to physically fight.&nbsp; Allen began to scream and laugh at us.&nbsp; It was like to girls in a mud wrestling contest.&nbsp; No holds bar.&nbsp; I ripped out Stacy's hair.&nbsp; She punched me in the nose.&nbsp; I bit her.&nbsp; She tried to put me in a headlock.&nbsp; Regardless of what we did to each other it still didn't solve who could be who.&nbsp; Our parents finally came in and seperated us.&nbsp; They asked us why we were fighting.&nbsp; I would not answer because I didn't want anyone to know it was over me wanting to play Sheerah.&nbsp; For some reason I think Stacy knew how much it would hurt me if we told the truth so she said that "Paul wanted to be Skeletor and I told him he couldn't be and we started fighting."&nbsp; Our parents made us apologize to each other and we laid back down together, Stacy and I,&nbsp; with my hand around her&nbsp;we finished watching the movie.&nbsp; I still think of this and always remember that I forgot to tell her "thank you."

       My Virginal Entry    &nbsp; This is officially my first entry to my new address.&nbsp; How exciting.&nbsp; I am sort of sad that I had to change the address...I mean I have had the original for almost two years.&nbsp; But it is better off this way.&nbsp; Thank you everyone for the words of encouragement that my new home is being welcomed.  Are house is basically sold.&nbsp; Actually the first people that came by to see the house bought it.&nbsp; I will miss my house.&nbsp; I mean I have lived there since I was 12 and now I'm 24.&nbsp; So a big chunk of my life is there.&nbsp; That is where I had my parties for turning 16, 18, 21 and my graduation.&nbsp; This is where we have had Christmas with the family for years.&nbsp; It is where someone tried to have sex in our bathroom downstairs in the basement.&nbsp; This is where I fell after back surgery because I was drunk and some other stuff.&nbsp; Those were the days.&nbsp; But I am excited to move into a new house.&nbsp; Actually it is an old house...a victorian style home.&nbsp; With big rooms, hardwood floors, and a killer porch.&nbsp; Plus the whole aspect of redecorating is appealing.&nbsp; And my room will be like 3 times its size now.&nbsp; So off with the old and movin' in with the new.  Anywho, I came into work two and a half hours early tonight.&nbsp; I am dragging.&nbsp; Not much sleep.&nbsp; I went about bought Alice Through the Looking Glass...the one that was made for t.v.&nbsp; It isn't made anymore so a friend of mine that works at a video store watched out for me and finally found a copy of it.&nbsp; Then I had to get a hair cut because let me just tell you....afro city.&nbsp; And I decided to get my eyebrows waxed and shaped again.&nbsp; This time it hurt...really really bad.&nbsp; But it is worth it.&nbsp; Now I have cute eyebrows and no redness.&nbsp; Don't know how that happened but I didn't get red from all the hair pullin.  But I need to get back to work.&nbsp; Hope everyone is well!!

       Petty Patty    &nbsp; I came in to work tonight to read a very harsh email from one of my co-workers.&nbsp; Let's see where to begin.&nbsp; Friday night I had asked Sherry B. if it would be okay if I left at 6am instead of 7am because I had a wedding to go to in the morning.&nbsp; Sherry B. by the way is in charge of vacation and leave and she said it was okay.&nbsp; I told her I would only leave if everything were caught up and there were no horrific events going on.&nbsp; Well 6am came and I was caught up and everything was running smoothly.&nbsp; I had asked our day shift person Pat if she wanted me to stay because I would.&nbsp; She kept saying it wasn't her decision.&nbsp; I told her I realized that but I wanted to make sure that me leaving an hour early wouldn't effect her.&nbsp; She said it was okay to leave as long as I had informed Sherry B. and my boss John L. of the situation.&nbsp; I told her this had already been done.&nbsp; Well here is what comes in the 1st shift handoff from Saturday (this went to everyone by the way):  "Paul H. left at 6:00 am. Short notice of a wedding. Paul, I know you may think I am nitpicking but everything was not completed when you left. Route Se had been assigned to Gary M and with him not showing up it should have been deleted and assigned to Mark L. Also Shannon did a power swap with the Se driver, and sent a message about this of which was acknowledged by you but did not execute. And I was creating the load sheet and had another task to perform to these loads before they can be assigned. It would have been nice to have had you here doing the metric while I was doing this. But none the less it got done."  Let's see I did the power swap...this is just assigning a truck to a driver...the trucks are called powers.&nbsp; Little did I know that the driver actually gave the pwr to someone else.&nbsp; The message Shannon sent in made it seem like he got rid of one truck and went into another truck.&nbsp; So that was my bad...he actually gave the truck to someone so the power swap I did should have not went on Shannon but on another driver.&nbsp; As for the route I should have took it off of Gary and put it on Mark but it didn't click to do so.&nbsp; Let me specify that these two things I overlooked take about a total of 5-7 minutes to complete.&nbsp; I actually showed Johannes my co-worker tonight and it took me under 3 minutes so I'm being generous in the time it would have taken considering Pat types extremely slow.&nbsp;   The following is the email that Pat recieved from our manager about the whole situation:  "Pat,  One word of caution in your e-mail regarding Paul H: It is usually best to give someone that kind of feedback in a personal e-mail and, at most, copy me in only. All team members need to know how their decisions impact the rest of the team. However, while it is important to let team members know when they drop a pass, it is normally a good idea to discuss it privately, and if that is unsuccessful, then with his/her direct supervisor (in this case, me).A good rule of thumb is to "counsel in private, and praise in public".  Paul,Let's talk when you get a chance."  Oh I just know she is going to be heated when she reads this.&nbsp; I actually called John tonight and woke him up to talk about this.&nbsp; He said that Pat should have never written all that for everyone to see and that I was in the right because I had permission to leave at 6am.&nbsp; He also said that the two things that were forgotten were so minor that it shouldn't have been an issue in the first place.&nbsp; John was extremely pissed on the phone at Pat's pettiness.&nbsp; John told me that Pat acts like she never makes mistakes and that the two things I forgot to do could have been forgotten by anyone because they were that "not important."&nbsp; I also got a big pat on the back for not being angry about the situation and told that I am the best employee when it comes to data entry and accuracy that John has on his crew at the present time.&nbsp; He said that my accuracy is at 100% and that my learning curve is astounding.&nbsp; He said he still can't believe how I pick up information and how I want to take on more.&nbsp;   So Pat a word to the wise "I will let this petty bullshit go this go around but the next time I will make sure to point out the shit that you forget to do on a daily basis that I have to do when I come in."&nbsp; And yes my fellow bloggers there are things that are supposed to be done by the time I come in that aren't my responsibility that I have to do.&nbsp; Take for instance the route never being changed...that is a first shift responsiblity.&nbsp;&nbsp; So Pat, why didn't you do the route change since that is your responsibility?"&nbsp; How about the numerious routes I have had to edit and add for the past two weeks because you neglected to do them?&nbsp;   I have never said anything about having to do why Pat has left undone at work.&nbsp; I do it and move on.&nbsp; So as you can see yes I am a little pissed that she would do this and then send it to everyone.&nbsp; I have never said or sent an email regarding what Pat has neglected to do so there is room for me being pissy about it.&nbsp; But I'll be pissy online and let John and Sherry handle Pat in the a.m.  God people can be so fucking evil when it comes to petty shit.  &nbsp;

       Just a day...just an ordinary day...     &nbsp;  Yesterday I never made it to the wedding.&nbsp; 1/4 because I was tired and 3/4 because I really didn't want to go.&nbsp; Yeah I'm coming out.&nbsp; I didn't want to go.&nbsp; Actually I had no desire to buy someone I barely know a wedding present and pretend I'm having a great time.&nbsp; So instead of going to a wedding I headed up to April's and we headed to Virginia to go shopping.&nbsp; They now have Super Targets.&nbsp; I'm like totally freakin.&nbsp;   I bought myself a new chenille throw, a birthday card with Martha Stewart on the front and ideas for crafts on the inside (not typical crafts), Hello Kitty Lip Balm in 6 flavors,  urlLink The Simple Life  on DVD, a cherry coke and  urlLink The Last Samurai  on DVD.&nbsp; Nicole Ritchie and Paris Hilton are now my new role models.&nbsp; I mean if given the chance don't tell me you wouldn't be some heiress twit with endless cash flow and a jet setting life.&nbsp; Because you would so take it just like me.&nbsp; Except I would be Nicole Ritchie because she has curves unlike Paris Hilton who is a&nbsp;walking upside down mop...with way over processed hair.   At any rate, I'd be having more fun if I were them today than myself.&nbsp; Today is just an ordinary day.

       Count me in...err..out    &nbsp; So today I'm supposed to go to Cheri and Michael's friend Becky's wedding.&nbsp; I want to go and everything but I just don't see it happening.&nbsp; First off I don't get off work until 7am.&nbsp; So not much sleep will be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;But more importantly my sinus' are acting up again.&nbsp; I'm at work now and have managed to puke several times.&nbsp; There is nothing worse than puking at work.&nbsp; Okay going to the bathroom at work is up there but puking...ehhh.&nbsp; So I'm thinking that I may have the parents take me to the hospital to have some chest x-rays done.&nbsp; This congestion bullshit is getting on my nerves.&nbsp; Not to mention that my back is now hurting from all the hurling.&nbsp; I took two of my pain meds earlier.&nbsp; I can't find the rest of them.&nbsp; So I have probably lost them yet again.&nbsp; I had several in an Aleve bottle and the rest in a baggie.&nbsp; I have no clue where they are.&nbsp; They were in my messenger bag with the Aleve bottle but now they aren't.&nbsp; My mother is always telling me just to give them to her so that&nbsp;I don't lose them.&nbsp; Well I did and then she gave them back to me and now they have sprouted legs and jumped ship.&nbsp; So I don't know what the hell to do now.&nbsp; I just know I don't want to be at work.&nbsp; I want to be home in a hot shower and then in my bed.&nbsp; My body feels like it has been through a war.&nbsp; I'm running on empty.&nbsp; I don't eat...well I do but only once a day.&nbsp; I sleep...but it is not a good solid sleep...I wake up constantly.&nbsp; I think this weekend I'm staying home and eating chicken noodle soup and staying under a vaporizer and air purifier.&nbsp; Son of a bitch.

       Court Day    &nbsp; Well I went to court today for my first ever speeding ticket in Maryland.&nbsp; The judge was hilarious.&nbsp; She told us "I will ask you about your driving record.&nbsp; If you tell the truth good.&nbsp; If you lie I will pull it up and if you did lie I will make your life hell."&nbsp; So, I was planning on saying "guilty with an explanation."&nbsp; I did but she didn't want the explanation...she wanted to know about my driving record.&nbsp; I told her it was 100% clean and that I had a copy of it for her.&nbsp; She lowered the fine to $175 and lowered the points from five to two.&nbsp; So needless to say I now have two points on my license.&nbsp; I wish I wouldn't have gotten any since this was my first offense but two is better than five.  I came in to work late tonight...with the permission of my boss.&nbsp; I don't really remember driving here because I was still extremely tired.&nbsp; I fell asleep several times tonight.&nbsp; This is bad.&nbsp; But I think it was due to my sugar being low from not eating all day.&nbsp; I was shaking and everything so I got a Mountain Dew (which I hate) and drank it for the sugar and caffeine.&nbsp; I'm okay right now but I could still afford to sleep for about 5 days.&nbsp; Come on 7am.&nbsp; I'm ready to go home and go back to sleep!!!

        I Told Myself...       &nbsp; I wouldn't cry when Erin and Andy left.&nbsp; I held out until they pulled out of the driveway and now I can't stop crying.&nbsp; I feel like a big dork.&nbsp; I wish that both of them could stay out here with me.&nbsp; I realize now how much Erin really means to me.&nbsp; She is so wonderful.&nbsp; She makes me so happy with her and I's quirky sense of humor.&nbsp; I gave her a big hug and deep down I didn't want to let go.&nbsp; Even though I didn't get to spend tons of time with her while she was out here I am so thankful for the time we did have.&nbsp; I know that there is a God now because how else would we experience something so beautiful as LOVE.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the most amazing thing I have ever felt in my life and I can't imagine it coming from anywhere else.&nbsp; Lord I wish you could help me stop crying. Now my nose is running and I've got tears all down my face.&nbsp; But they are tears of happiness for Erin and a bit of sadness that she is gone again.  I love you Erin.

       Lazy Daze    &nbsp;  *Note:&nbsp; If anything is misspelled it is because I'm at work and I'm so tired I have fell asleep three times...just joking...only once.    &nbsp; When I woke up tonight I took two of my Zyrtek D extended release 12 hour.&nbsp; Then I laid back down after I got ready for work.&nbsp; When I got back up I was like "damn I'm tired."&nbsp; Well little did I know but this shit will make you tired.&nbsp; So tired that you feel like a zombie.&nbsp; Later at work I started to wake up and due to the air conditioner being broken my sinus' started to go out of control so I took another Zyrtek D extended release 12 hour.&nbsp; Well then I notice that I'm falling asleep at the desk.&nbsp; I bundle up in the chair because I was caught up with work and bam I'm out for a cool 5 minutes.&nbsp; I look at Johannes and I'm like "I know why I'm tired now.&nbsp; My fucking sinus' medicine is doing it."&nbsp; So I have struggled all night to not knod off.&nbsp; Sherry N. if you read this I know my secret is safe with you homegirl.&nbsp; Hope your vacay went good.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So needless to say I am finally waking up.&nbsp; I'm not taking my sinus meds until I get home because if I do take them before I'm afraid I may fall asleep at the wheel and we all know I have bad enough luck being awake and driving.

       I Fear The Month After March...    &nbsp; So like I said I was supposed to go see Cheryl and April yesterday.&nbsp; Well my dumbass doesn't set the alarm when I get home because I thought I was just going to stay awake until I had to leave.&nbsp; My bad.&nbsp; I fell asleep in a matter of an hour and didn't wake up until 730pm.&nbsp; By this time I know that April is steaming mad.&nbsp; I have let her down too often and this just takes the cake.&nbsp; She has been the only person in my life that has never let me down and has always stuck by me.&nbsp; I need to start doing the same and stop being so irresponsible when it comes to April and I's friendship.&nbsp; It is hard though when you work a completely different schedule.&nbsp; I'm up at night now.&nbsp; Not during the day...except today of course because my back started hurting.&nbsp; Anyway, so I am terrified to call her because I know she is fuming.&nbsp; I can tell by the comment last night.&nbsp; But I'm going to call her and offer to take her and Adam out to lunch in Frederick to make up for me being such a loser. &nbsp; But before I go I have to tell you about my dream last night.&nbsp; I rarely remember dreams but for some reason I remembered this one.&nbsp; I was dating someone.&nbsp; At first it wasn't clear who I was dating.&nbsp; All I know is that the relationship held plenty of passion, laughter, happiness, and above all LOVE.&nbsp; I actually felt like I was "in love" in this dream.&nbsp; It was almost overwhelming.&nbsp; The dream like lasted for a month into our relationship until I woke up.&nbsp; The last thing I remember was that I was buying my boyfriend an antique necklace with a charm on it.&nbsp; It represented the first movie we had ever seen together.&nbsp; I never got to give it to you Patrick Doyle!!&nbsp; because I woke up too soon.&nbsp; I don't know why it is that I chose you to be the boyfriend in my dream but let me just tell you I was so at peace and happy.&nbsp; It was like I was on an emotion I had never felt before.&nbsp; When I woke up I wanted so much for it to be real but then I realized it would never happen because I couldn't fall back to sleep.&nbsp; So hopefully tonight I'll have a repeat performance.&nbsp; By the way Patrick the sex was great, we were on vacation with some friends, and both my parents loved you as my boyfriend.&nbsp;

        The Rain In Spain Falls Mainly On The Plain       &nbsp;  This is one of my favorite lines from "My Fair Lady."&nbsp; I don't know why I'm thinking of it but I am.&nbsp; I often think of things out of nowhere and this just happens to be running through my head.&nbsp; After I went to MAMSI to collect my personal belongings and say goodbye to everyone I couldn't remember the names of everyone and I spent most of the day trying to think of their last names.&nbsp; I was like "what the fuck?"&nbsp; It is not like I didn't work with them for almost a year.&nbsp; How do you forget things so fast?&nbsp; And about 5-6 minutes ago I finally remember the name of one of my ex co-workers.&nbsp; It took like 10 hours but I finally remembered.&nbsp; Does anyone else ever get those nagging questions in their head that you can't figure out and it comes to you like hours or days later.&nbsp; But the whole time it bugs you constantly that you can't figure out the answer to the question and you know that it is a simple answer which makes it that much worse.&nbsp; I have had this happen to me tons of times and it drives me absolutely buggy.&nbsp; And the thing is is that I will think of the same question again maybe a few days later or whatever and again I can't remember the answer to it again.&nbsp; One of my favorite movies is "Steal Magnolia's."&nbsp; I have watched this movie a good 175 times.&nbsp; I love the beginning when Ouiser is at her best being the queen bitch of the movie.&nbsp; Well I was running through the list of characters both first and last names and I could not for the life of me remember who Darryl Hannah played.&nbsp; I remember her saying something about her last name being associated with "Zwalie" but could not remember her first name.&nbsp; I finally remember it like 5 days later...it is Annelle.&nbsp; So here is the list of characters if ever I should forget again.  &nbsp; Sally Field=M'lynn Eatenton Julia Roberts=Shelby Eatenton Latcherie Darryl Hannah=Annelle Dupuy Desoto Dolly Parton=Truvy Jones Olympia Dukakis=Clairee Blecher Shirley MacLaine=Ouiser Boudreaux Tom Skerritt=Drum Eatenton Dylan McDermott=Jackson Latcherie Kevin J. O'Connor=Sammy Desoto Billy McCutcheon=Owen Jenkins Ann Wedgeworth=Aunt Fern Knowl Johnson=Tommy Eatenton Jonathan Ward=Jonathan Eatenton Nancy Parsons=Janice Van Meter (two pigs fighting over a blanket...one of my favorite lines) &nbsp; Anyway, I am feeling 110% better.&nbsp; The congestion came back a little tonight but I took my medicine and poof it was off like a prom dress.&nbsp; Tomorrow I am going to my friend Cheryl's house to spend some time with her and Gwen (both are my co-workers from MAMSI and I love them to death).&nbsp; Then after I leave there I'm headed to April's house to help her plan the center pieces for her wedding reception.&nbsp; I think I'm going to sketch a picture tonight to get an idea of what I want.&nbsp; I'm thinking a reflective mirror on the bottom with a nice ivy and baby's breath wreath sitting on it with a glass hurricane and single white candle.&nbsp; Something simple yet classic.&nbsp; April and Adam are paying for the wedding themselves so I'm trying to make it cost effective.&nbsp; I can make beautiful flower arrangements...my grandmother taught me how to do this.&nbsp; But at the same time I don't want her to have to pay out the nose for the centerpieces.&nbsp; You figure when I made Barb's bouquets for her and the bridesmaids she only had to spend $75 and it was for herself and I believe 3-4 bridesmaids.&nbsp; Barb's bouquet was absolutely gorgeous.&nbsp; I'll have to see if I can get a picture of it and post it online.&nbsp; I do all the flower arrangements at my house.&nbsp; I'll take some pictures and post them so you can see that I am indeed crafty.&nbsp; And after I leave April's house I'm going out to dinner with Erin and Andy.&nbsp; I think April and I are going to head to Frederick to go to A.C. Moore craftshop because they are having a huge sale on their flowers.&nbsp; They do this once a year and the silk flowers are I believe 45-75% off.&nbsp; So we should be able to get all the flowers and accessories tomorrow.&nbsp; I can't wait.&nbsp; I'm hoping that April will let me do the bouquets too.&nbsp; I don't think she should do fresh flowers because they don't keep that well even if you dry them and I'd like for her to have something that will last forever...just like her marriage.&nbsp; I am so excited for her getting married.&nbsp; I really like Adam he is a really cool guy and I think that her makes her extremely happy.&nbsp; Then Sunday I'm headed to Arundel Mills with Michael and Cheri.&nbsp; I don't really need anything aside from&nbsp; my shower gel from The Body Shop.&nbsp; The scent is Satsuma.&nbsp; It smells absolutely delightful.&nbsp; It is like $12 a bottle but it is well worth it.&nbsp; I'd like to get some new cologne too but I'm not sure what I want this time.&nbsp; I have a good amount of cologne but I'm ready for a change.&nbsp; Oh yeah and I want to go to FYE and get a new movie.&nbsp; This will bring my collection to around 430 if I get a new movie.&nbsp; It is getting out of hand but I'm such a movie freak.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Hopefully, we will get to go to the movies too.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to seeing both Michael and Cheri.&nbsp; I want to go to dinner at DuClaw.&nbsp; The chicken and mashed potatoes there are to die for.&nbsp; Plus the restaurant is very nice.&nbsp; It has an industrial appearance.&nbsp; They have plasma televisions in the booths.&nbsp; But we never use them because we like to have those great conversations over dinner.&nbsp; Hopefully, Michael will have other things to talk about besides himself. &nbsp; Well everyone have a great night and weekend.&nbsp; I'll be writing more at  urlLink Pink Haired Girl  shortly.&nbsp; The server there seems to be down.&nbsp; But anyway....I'm off to do some work. &nbsp; And I want to send a shoutout to Sherry N.'s son.&nbsp; He is at state competition for baseball.&nbsp; So best of luck to him.&nbsp; Bring us home a trophy!!!!!

        For Pete's Sake      &nbsp;  Well let's see.&nbsp; I finally quit my other job with Mamsi.&nbsp; I am glad that that is over with.&nbsp; Anyway, like I had said Monday had proved to be a quite trying day at work.&nbsp; But Tuesday....oh Tuesday.&nbsp; I got up and got ready for work and just before I get ready I get the feeling of "you are about to throw up."&nbsp; And I do...but this time it is worse.&nbsp; I start throwing up nasty phlegm and to top it off blood.&nbsp; I get the chills, light-headedness, cold sweats and the feeling that I'm about to die.&nbsp; So I try to make it in to work two hours late and when I get here I am told to go home because I didn't look right.&nbsp; The next morning I go to the ENT and I'm told that I have a severe sinus infection and that if I would have waited a few more days that I would have gotten pneumonia.&nbsp; So I had to miss another day of work until I could get some meds in me to dry up the infection.&nbsp; Anyway, get my father to bring the doctor's note over to work and everything is covered.&nbsp; Then I get a phonecall today from Aerotek the people that have hired me out saying that my manager called in and was worried about me missing the past several days and that it is a red flag and blah blah blah.&nbsp; I am freakin.&nbsp; I'm like I hope I don't lose my job.&nbsp; So I call my manager John and explain everything to him.&nbsp; I don't think he realized the whole "throwing up of blood" thing.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; So I come in tonight and talk to Sherry who works like big time with John and I'm in tears because I'm afraid that my job is in jeopardy.&nbsp; She tells me that everything will be okay and to not worry she will talk to John in the morning.&nbsp; So when I had gotten off the phone with John he seemed to understand but I just hope that he realizes that I love the job and don't plan on going anywhere.&nbsp; I mean who the hell can help getting that sick.&nbsp; But I'm feeling better and I'm back at work.&nbsp; Erin and Andy arrived from Tacoma on Wednesday.&nbsp; I didn't get close to Erin because she is prego and I don't want her getting sick.&nbsp; They are staying at the house and we made breakfast this morning.&nbsp; Pancakes, ham, and eggs.&nbsp; It was yummy.&nbsp; And yes I actually ate some ham for the first time in forever.&nbsp; But still no red meat.&nbsp; Anyway, that about sums up the current state.&nbsp; I'm glad that Erin and Andy are staying at the house with me because I haven't seen her in over two years.&nbsp; I just hope that everything goes okay with the job situation.&nbsp; I mean I had doctor's orders and a doctor's note not to come back to work until tonight so I know I'm covered there.&nbsp; My nerves are pretty much shot and I'll be taking a couple of nerve pills when I get home.&nbsp; But Sherry B. reassuring me that everything would be okay makes me a little settled.&nbsp; I have no clue why my sinus' are acting so out of whack.&nbsp; The doctor said that it has probably been draining and draining for a long while now and it is just catching up with me.&nbsp; All I know is that throwing up blood scared the living shit out of me.&nbsp; I don't want that to happen again.&nbsp; So I haven't been smoking much either.&nbsp; I'm trying to cut back and hopefully in six months be done with it.&nbsp; It's a nasty habit anyway.&nbsp; But other than that please wish me luck that everything will work out okay because Lord knows I have had enough drama to last a life time since I turned 20.&nbsp; Back surgeries, staying sick, and all the other bullshit.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just want some calm in my life.&nbsp; Some more stability.&nbsp; Just for things to start flowing right....not like the flow of a damn period.&nbsp; Later dudes!!  &nbsp;  By the way I'm guest blogging again at  urlLink Pink Haired Girl  again if anyone wants to stop by.

       Oh What A Night   Work proved to be hectic tonight. All kinds of driver complaints and bitching.  Drivers getting sick.  I barely left my desk all night.  Now I've got to get back to work.  Just thought I write out a little of my frustrations since I have a minute.

       Current Events   It is not like I keep up with current events that mean anything.  However, I keep up with current events that definitly mean nothing to the current diaster the world is in or headed for.  Last night when I went to 7-11 for some Tums because I had heartburn I saw the cover of People Magazine and guess who was on the cover?  Britney Spears.  And she is getting herself married.  She looks so cute with her man.  Also I love the ring she bought for herself because we all know that he could not afford that five carat rock she has so snug on her fingers.  And her little Maltese...oh but could it be anymore cute?  I don't think so.  So that is the current event that I am currently dealing with.  Oh and the fact that Britney needs to give me a call to plan her wedding because I know I could do wonders for it.  And the other current event that I'm dealing with is Missy's birthday.  So Happy Birthday Missy!!  I got to talk to her at about 12:02am and bam I got to wish her a happy birthday.    Mom is headed to Ocean City for the rest of the week and weekend and I'm working.  So I better get off of here and do some of that.  Oh and thanks for the comment Sherry Neehigh!!  It's one thing to care about yourself but another to make yourself a priority above everything and everybody.  You can care for yourself but you should also care about those people who care about you and I just don't see that happening in Michael's world.

       Some more thoughts   I thought some more this morning.  I don't know why I am investing so much time into it but it is like I cannot stop thinking about things.  I had always told Cheri that I would like to have a friend that would understand where I was coming from with the whole "gay" thing.  But now that I have someone who has went through the same things I'm like why did I ever ask for one or want one.  I know that it is just the wrong person who thinks they can introduce me to things.  The thing is is that I'm the one introducing this person to the new things.  Maybe this person is just too naive and sheltered.  Or maybe he is a fucking self centered queen.  I don't know.  I just know that this whole weekend has changed my whole perception on Michael and I feel like it has damaged or stained what friendship was developing.  There were things that have happened in the past that I have overlooked...you know like the time he brought someone he has just met into the Blazer while Cheri and I and got a blowjob with us in the car.  I mean who the hell does something like that.  He said he didn't think we would care.  And it was happening to him so why were we worried about it.  What the fuck ever.  Get a hotel room.  And to hook up with someone he had just met that night for D.C. at that...please.  That's why he thought he had caught something about a week later.  Also, I had to be the one to tell him that you can catch STDs through oral sex.  He had no clue.  I feel like I'm raising a child more than have a friend and that is truly what is bothering me.  There is more but I just don't feel like getting into it because I know I'll really say something I shouldn't.

       The Luckie Duckie   So I'm at work now.  I have had about 2 and 1/2 hours of sleep.  Just got in from vacay at 7pm.  I had a blast in Busch Gardens and the whole vacation.  But it started off horribly.  When I went to meet Michael Friday morning his car starter went out and we had to have that fixed.  So that delayed us leaving for about and hour or longer.  On the way down I got separated from my parents.  They kept on telling me to speed up to catch up with them but I didn't because I was afraid of getting pulled over.  Finally, we met up at a truck stop.  My parents pulled out before Michael, Cheri and I so again I get separated.  Well I sort of knew where I was going but then I realized I didn't.  So my mother calls me and I'm trying to communicate with her and I forget to watch my speed.  When I realize "Hey I'm speeding." I hit my brakes and it's too late.  A cop had already clocked me and pulled me over.  He asked me why I was speeding and I politely tell him.  And I swear I was very nice and just scared.  I told him that this was my first time driving by myself and I got separated from my parents and I was basically lost and that I was on the phone with my mother trying to find out where to go.  When I realized I was speeding I tried to slow down.  I told him I knew where I was but not where to go so I was trying to catch up.  I told him I wasn't familiar with the area and had no clue what the speed limit was.  I almost started crying.  I don't think he believed that three people in their 20's were following parents per se but we were.  He gave me a summons to court.  So now I have to go back down there to go to court to explain to the judge the whole situation.  Here the whole time I don't speed and the time I decide to so I don't get lost I get pulled over.  And to make matters worse my mother said "Watch out for the cops" when I pick up the phone and I respond "too late I'm getting pulled over."  So the whole time I'm down there I'm wondering what is going on.  My father stopped at the Sheriff's office and talked to her about it.  She couldn't believe it and was like "I am so sorry that happened did your son tell the officer?"  She said that the officer could have let me go knowing the situation and that him keeping me there only furthered the distance between me and my parents.  She said since I have a clean record that I will probably just be fined and at worst have to take a driving class.  I hope everything works out because it really was an honest mistake.  When I had to sign the paper I was rubbing my eyes so I didn't cry and the officer yelled "You need to sign this paper Mr. Hebb."  He was such a dick to me.  I think her realized I was gay.  He was cool until I opened my mouth.  Since I sound a little faggish.  He totally copped an attitude with me...no pun intended.  But hopefully everything will be okay.  And the Sheriff's reassurance makes me feel better.  Aside from that the trip was wonderful.  I was with my best friend Cheri and I think we grew closer over this trip.  Michael on the otherhand has driven me crazy.  I felt at times like putting duct tape around his mouth so he would stop talking about hisself and how everyone wanted him.  He made Cheri curl his eyelashes so he would look sexier.  Hello that is not going to happen.  He accused me of wearing mascara and curling my lashes.  I don't do either.  The only time I have worn anything on my eyes is at Halloween.  I wore eyeliner one time when we went out but other than that he is totally jealous of my eyes.  I mean I love Michael to death but he is the most self centered person.  I know I talk about myself but it is like 97% joking and most of it is negative.  Every story he had to tell was about himself.  Even when we were talking about other people like stories of death in a family or a serious subject he would butt in and be like "Oh this one time I..." or "Did you guys see him look at me?"  or "Look at his butt..."  It is like all the conversations are one sided.  And he made a comment about me that both Cheri and I wanted to slap him for.  It was 94 degrees.  Any of you that know me know that I stay hot so I was of course sweating.  He said "I'm tired of people complaining."  This was in reference to Cheri saying "It is hot out today."  Then he says "I really don't get hot and I certainly do sweat like that."  In reference to me like I'm some kind of freak.  But I let it go.  And to top it all off ever since I said I wanted a Louis Vuitton coin purse and a Dooney and Burke coin purse that is all he talks about.  We went to Dooney and Bourke and I was looking at the change purses.  I was going to get one and he grabbed it out of my hand and said "That is so what I've been wanting."  Then he went and bought it.  I was like nevermind I didn't want that.  Cheri looked at me like I cannot believe he just did that.  When we get to the car he says "Who is this by anyway?"  Then he says "But like I've been saying I want to get my LV coin purse."  I didn't say a damn thing.  Then we go to Timberland and Cheri is looking at a cellphone cover.  He does the same thing.  Grabs it out of her hand.  She says "I was looking at that."  He says it doesn't matter I need one anyway.  She bit her tongue too.  You don't just go grabbing stuff out of people's hand and buying what they are getting ready to buy look for your own.  He keeps claiming that it was his idea to get a D&B and LV coin purse when he didn't even know who D&B was and just found out who LV was when we bought him his wallet.  My mother said he wanted the stuff we wanted because he wants to fit in with us and be cool or whatever because he thinks Cheri and I are cool.  But it comes to a point when it just becomes rude and obnoxious.  Anyway, I could go on for about a novel's worth so I'll shut up and do some work.  Hope everyone has a great 4th.    P.S.  In case I haven't said it lately to all my bloggie friends "I love you guys/gals."  And thanks for the comment Paul (NoMilk) it so makes sense.

       TeleTubby     So Sherry NeeHigh at work gave me a little television. It is black and white but I love it. I have it next to me at my desk. So since yesterday I have enjoyed late night programming while working. Talk about "loving it." If I could hook a DVD or VCR up to it I would. But then I really don't think I would get anything done. So far I have managed to be more productive at work with the television than without.  Question time: Is a phrase that contains "rock this," "rock that," or any type of "rock" a stereotypical gay thing? or have I gone straight?  Every person I hear use something like "I would so rock that." Or "Let's rock this." I find out they are gay. Or maybe it is just where I live. I personally use "loving it" more than "rock that."  Anyway, I'm tired and I have television to get back to....I mean work to get back to.    Update: 4:59a.m.        I just got finished watching "The Big Comfy Couch."  Has anyone out there ever noticed how big of a queen Major Bedhead is?

       I'm a survivor     As you all know I went camping for the first time on Saturday.  I was at the campsite by 9:30am.  I was wishing I was in the comfort of my own bed by 10:00am.  April put up my tent.  I then decorated it with all my pillows and blankets and bags.  Knowing that I had been awake since Friday night at 8pm I decided to go to sleep for a power nap.  Well by 12:15pm I still was not asleep.  I'm not sure why.  I got back out of the tent and talked for a while.  Ate some junk food and a bavarian pretzel melt I had purchased on my way to April's house.  I finally felt like I could fall asleep at 2:00pm.  I went back in the tent and fell asleep until 9:30pm.  April and everyone there tried to get me to wake up earlier to eat dinner but I didn't want to.  I just wanted to sleep.  So when I finally got up we played cards and talked around the fire until about 3:30am.  I then retired back to my tent and slept until 10:30am.  I woke up...had missed breakfast and my back was hurting that morning.  Well since it was so cold outside my sinus' started to act up and I wound up having to puke a couple of times.  I then got a headache and laid back down for about three more hours.  My tent became an oven.  Set on temperature "hell."  I was covered in sweat and my nose was draining.  I finally got up and talked some more and drank a soda.  I was watching the birds and the bugs flit around the campsite.  We packed up around 6:00pm to come home.  There is a lot more that went on.  Example:  I found my other personality "Pappy Joe" and entertained everyone with his antics.  I am just out of it tonight and don't feel like giving a play by play.  There really isn't that much more because all you can do when you camp is talk, eat, and sleep.  And for those of us that have partners have sex.  Which I heard coming from the neighboring tent.  But anyway, it was fun and I would do it again.  Only I would have a bigger tent and an air mattress.  I'll write more tomorrow when I feel better.  My back is hurting more than it has before I had surgery so yeah I'm not in the mood to blog.  But I wanted everyone to know that I'm a survivor of my first camping trip.

       Flashy Honk Honk     On my way to work tonight a cop pulled out behind me. I was obeying every law. I had my cruise control set at the speed limit and so on. Well when I was going around a turn my tire went on the yellow line. I didn't think anything of it. Well I'm almost at work and the cop decides he is going to pull me over. I'm like WTF. He comes up to the car and says "I saw your tire go on the yellow line and I pulled you over to make sure you weren't drinking." I told him I was headed to work and that I realized I went over a little too far on the line. It was my bad. Well he makes me give him my license, registration and proof of insurance. I'm like he cannot be giving me a ticket for a random drunk driver stop. He brings back a warning because my registration wasn't signed. I now have a deep appreciation for loathing cops. He was very nice though. Actually, I understand why he pulled me over but I'm thinking that my car is possessed by some cop attracting demon. I am really thinking about getting rid of the Mercedes.  So I'm at work now. I was 10 minutes late because of being stopped. Work is the same old same old. I am awaiting an email from O.J. I look forward to them every night. I like his writing style and I am thankful that I now have a new friend to chat with. A friend that brings out the philosophical side of me. It is a good thing. So thanks for sending that first email O.J. I look forward to many more in the future.  Yesterday when I got off of work I went to WalMart...my mecca and had to get fluid pills. My feet were retaining water. I was afraid they were going to fall off. But they are much better now. I also bought "13 Going On 30." I have made it through the first 45 minutes so far. Not the best movie but I like the fashion in the movie. I'll finish it Sunday when I get back from my camping trip tomorrow night.  Yes, Paul is going camping. Will he survive? I'm not sure. But you will know if there is a post on Sunday or Monday recounting this earth shattering event.  Please pray that there are no Michael Myers or Freddy's out in the woods with us. Or at least I hear that eerie music so I can run ahead of time.  Later.   urlLink   P.S. Update.  I have spent the whole night reading  urlLink this  woman's blog.  Absolutely satisfying.

       Return to Oz   Am I like the only human being that remembers this movie and owns it?  It was Fairuza Balks first major motion picture.  While it can never live up to the original Wizard of Oz it is fairly good.  My favorite character in this movie is the evil queen who collects different heads and wears them because she finds her own to ugly and aged.  But at any rate I recommend that you see this movie if you have not.  It is now on DVD and can be purchased at a reasonable price of around $15.00.  I'm feeling much better.  However, I am exhausted.  Every night I make a pledge that I am going to go home, get a shower/bath, and head straight to bed but put on Driving Mrs. Daisy to fall asleep to.  It has yet to happen and I've been saying that it is going to happen everyday this week.  So, after getting my paycheck in the morning I am going to the bank, getting some breakfast and I damn well will be in bed by 830am.  I will be asleep by no later than 930am.  Even if I have to hit myself over the head with a wine bottle.  I will succeed.   I am so done with not sleeping.

       Splitting Melon     Tonight I woke up with a god awful migraine.  It subsided for a while after I took a pain killer but it has slowly crept back.  What to do?  What to do?  I have taken some Tylenol but for some reason that stuff never seems to work.  And shall I mention work?  Why yes...yes I shall.  It is going so slow.  Slower than usual.  Last night flew by.  Maybe because I had to file about 50,000 papers.  And this my friends is no exaggeration.  It took forever to do the filing but with Johannes' help it went faster.  I now have a deep hate for filing.  Plus the fact that I punctured my ring finger with a heavy duty staple didn't help.  Blood...blood...and more blood.  When this happened I yelled that I "hated fucking filing and that I had to smoke a cigarette because my nerves were shot."  So I did.  But the filing still got done.  A couple of years ago I wrote a poem.  It was called Ode to Icky Bug.  Well our building has these hideous creatures.  There was one in the building last night.  It was as long as a crayon.  If not longer.  With all it's thread like legs it waited patiently for me to spray it with window glass cleaner.  I got up on a chair.  Pat handed me the spray and I began to spray.  This motherfucker jumped at us.  Fell to the floor and ran off.  Pat and I screamed at the top of our lungs.  Hopefully, the bitch died.  And there is another one in here again tonight.  He has been sprayed with window cleaner too.  He did not jump...only ran.  Hopefully, he is running to that bright light I have so nicely led him to with the spray of cleaner.  Oh how I loathe insects.  Especially, mutant bugs.

       Table of Contents     I am sitting at work and I am happy. I haven't been this happy with a job in so long. Actually, since I was 18 and worked my infamous days as a Subway employee. April you can vouch for those days being infamous....because to us they were. I have an awesome crew that I work with. There is little to no bickering between coworkers. Well with the exception of that one time I have mentioned. Now I do not consider the truck drivers my coworkers. They are more as the office workers servants. So that is what I will consider them...servants. They serve the purpose we give them. However, I do realize that our jobs depend upon their performance that is why I can still appreciate the work that they do. They work their asses off by the way.  I get my new insurance on Friday. Thanks be to God that I don't have to worry about not having insurance.  I am looking forward to the move now more than I thought that I would. My parents so deserve this house. They have always wanted a victorian style home and now they will have it. I am going to try to give them money every week just to help out. I am so proud of them for all that they have accomplished and all that they have left to accomplish.  Baby Girl (my pet rat) has to go in for surgery in two weeks. Most rats tend to get tumors/cysts. And Baby Girl was lucky enough to get one. The vet says that it will not be a problem to remove it. It is near her jaw so if it gets any bigger it can impair her from eating and if too big it cannot be removed. I am worried for her and I pray that nothing happens to my little precious gem. I still remember the day I bought her. I was so nervous because this little life was in my hands and I was now responsible for it. She was so tiny...the length of a 4 yr olds hand if not smaller and about as round as a pack of Rolo. She has made me appreciate having a pet that I can call my own even though I don't get to see her more. Mom and Dad love her to death. At first they were a little gunshy about it but now they love her more and more everyday. Plus her sassy attitude makes for much laughter. So please if you would say a little prayer as stupid as you may think it is that my rat, Baby Girl is okay before, during and after the surgery. It would be much appreciated.  Well I've got to get something to eat and smoke a cigarette...which I know I need to stop doing...and this actually pertains to both eating and smoking. Just kidding. I don't eat enough as it is. Now smoking I do too much of but I am cutting back and hope to stop by the end of the year if not sooner.  So everyone have a great night.

       400 and more to go     This is officially my 400th post. Jeezy Squeezy, I never thought that I would have made it this far. Work is the same old same old tonight. I got another email from O.J. He is extremely nice. His presence alone in emails are so close to home.  He makes me feel that I have a friend that I have known before the mortal coil was snipped.  So O.J. please note that you are very much appreciated and welcomed.  Saturday night was a blast. I woke up at 8pm on Saturday night. Called April and headed to her cousin Kimmy's house to play cards until 230a.m. Much fun and laughter was had. On my way home I get a call from April that Amanda had called her house and woke her mother up trying to get ahold of me. So I called Amanda...who was completely tore up. So I turned around and headed back up to Amanda's house. Billy, Amanda, and Rhiannon were blitzed. I had a couple of drinks, played truth or dare, and chatted. It was great hanging out with them. I have missed that for quite some time now. I was feelin' pretty good by the time I left. We will definitely have to do it again Amanda!!!!  So now it is Monday...well actually Tuesday because it is 1:34a.m. and I'm at work. Things are running smoothly so far. Monday usually forcasts the week ahead so I'm glad everything is running calmly. I'm supposed to go camping this upcoming weekend with April and Adam. I thought it was this past Saturday but it wasn't. And thank God it wasn't because of the storms we had Saturday night. So we will see how this whole camping thing goes.  I just hope that I survive. I'm bringing a battery operated television with me though...because I want to at least be reminded that I'm living in the 21st century while I'm out in the wilderness on Saturday night.  My mother went to the doctor's today...she has walking pneumonia. My father has strep throat. So far I have evaded illness. And it had better stay that way. They are both on anti-biotics...I'm hoping this will make them immune. If not I'm going to be one cranky bitch come the day I get sick again.   P.S. it is now 2:44a.m.     Being teased and tortured for so many years in school I always have this feeling that people are talking about me. I guess it is some type of paranoia or something. When they whisper or start laughing as I approach it doesn't matter. Tonight when I got back from the store Paul D. and Shannon "aka Soon to be renamed JerkOff" N. starting laughing as I was walking toward them. I heard Paul D. say as I entered the door "I know...I know." If they are going to makes comments about me then they need to do it to my face...because as we all know I am not the one to fuck with when it comes to finding out you have been whispering about me behind my back. As many of my friends know I am the King of Vengence and I always get it. Regardless of the price. So Paul and Shannon need take this advice if they think their mental games of whispering will not have reprocussions.   It is now 4:09a.m.     And I am letting the bullshit from earlier get to me. I need to learn to brush it off because no matter where you go in life you will always have a barberic asshole not far behind. If shit was said so be it...if not then my bad. But all I have to say is that thank God for the truck drivers I do talk to. They are some of the nicest people I have met.

       You get rid of it...     The title above is my favorite line from any movie I have ever had the chance to watch.  It was spoken by Claudia (aka Kirsten Dunst) as the child vampire in Interview with the Vampire.  When first I heard her speak this and to this day the passion, deceit, and anger in this one phrase makes me wonder how a child of only 11 years of age could deliver a performance as astounding as hers in IWTV?  But anyway, now you all know my favorite movie line.  It is simple when read but when spoken in the movie it sends chills through my body.  I went today to see The Village with my parents, Aunt Velma, and Uncle Keith.  It was actually pretty decent.  Not the best picture my M. Night S. but who am I to judge?  I would say wait until it comes out on video to see it unless you can't because you are a movie freak like me.  Nonetheless, I didn't have to pay for the ticket so how can I complain.  After the movie we headed to Romano's Macaroni Grill...which we all know is probably my favorite restaurant next to The Cheesecake Factory.  Dinner was good.  There was much laughter.  The kind of atmosphere I miss so much with my family since I live 70 miles from them or more.  Before we headed to Frederick we went and saw the house that I will be moving into in the next two weeks.  It is wicked.  Victorian.  The garden alone makes me feel as if I were in New Orleans.  There is even a porch out from the back bedroom on the third floor.  Not to mention a killer attic.  The basement (as we know I don't like basements) is creepy and reminds me of something you would find in The Village time period.  But all in all I am in love with the house.  And for a whopping $340,000 I should be.  Again, not paying for it no need to complain.  But now I'm off to bed I have been up since 8pm Saturday night and it is now Monday 1:55 a.m.  But, I want to leave you with an email I received tonight from someone I have never met, heard from, but now appreciate due to the following:  Paul,  I have been a reader of your blog for sometime now.  Not really sure how I got there originally as I often surf through blogs via links on other blogs.  Yours really touched me in a very personal way as I could see much of myself and my searching and confusion when I was much younger.  Happily, I am in a much better place now than I was back then, or as I suspect the you are often in now.  Anyway, I will be sorry not to be able to read your blog anymore.  I understand your need for more privacy and, as a stranger to you, I have no right to intrude on that privacy.   If I may make an unsolicited comment...I want you to know that things are not always as dark, or even as confusing, as they seem sometimes.  I consider myself to be a sensitive and creative individual, as I sense that you are, and as such I have often intensified reality (if you can understand my meaning) and over analyzed things.  We are the type of people who feel things so deeply that we paint or otherwise create them and write them from the very depth of our souls.  Love eludes us or, as I have discovered in my journey, it appears to elude us and it throws us into a dark and empty space from which we struggle to find our way back.  When we love, we love from such a place in our very souls that few ever feel or understand.  And we often pin everything on that love.  Sometimes even our very existence.  With age and experience and the love/support/understanding of some special people I have learned to understand my special and unique nature and to live more harmoniously with who/what I am.   Enough intensity.  I have a tendency to ramble on if so allowed.  I would just like you to know that I have appreciated your wit and have sympathized with you when you have bared your soul.  If you don't mind that a total stranger looks in on you once in awhile, I would appreciate and value your new blog address.  If you do mind, I am totally understanding.  Blog On!  O.J.  Is this not the sweetest email?  I haven't received something so positive in a long time.  It makes all the times I have pressed the Publish Post button all the more rewarding.  Night All!!!
