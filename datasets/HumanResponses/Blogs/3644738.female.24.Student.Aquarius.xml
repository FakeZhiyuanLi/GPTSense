      I was born in England and have lived here my whole life, they even gave me a passport and a free college education but I don't feel comfortable calling myself British.  Neither of my parents were born here so I am first generation, which makes the whole assimilation impossible! However I cannot say with passion and confidence that I am an African because (this will probably sound like the most twisted mess you ever heard but) I can't relate to my own people.  I went over there in 2001 and to cut a long story short I was supposed to stay for 3 weeks but came back "HOME" after 2.  I would have been back sooner but there is only 1 flight a WEEK!! I felt like the "ginger haired step-child" when I was out there because I stuck out like a sore thumb and everywhere I went people where like "Ah this nah American woman" or "How de body English Woman"  Hey, some people even referred to me as being White!!!!!  Everything about the place was so alien to me, social order, the city's infrastructure, the mindset of the people and the saddest thing was the poverty! On a comical aside: You know what I said prior about not feeling British...Well when the plane landed I said to myself "God Save The Queen & All That"  (Best said in a Cockney accent (if you don’t know what I’m talking about watch 2 minutes of “Eastenders” on BBC America).  It was definitely an experience I'll never forget .....I'm a better person for it!!  I'm so THANKFUL for what I have and I'm not talking about material possessions, technological advancements etc ..... But OPPORTUNITY!! Something the majority of Sierra Leoneans do not have!!

      Little Sister   I've been poetically inspired by a simple salutation. Shakespeare once said, "What's in a name"? I have now, at this very moment realised that labels not only mean so much  but also have the power to influence or in this case destroy one's perception of their future.   Little Sister as it stands is deceptively innocent.   How could these words take my being from a place of positivity and hope to bitter disappointment.  I don't know how often others come across a person that is so much more special than the rest.   Someone so in tune with your thoughts, feelings… your vibe that they embody your idea of perfection.  Somebody so unique that you begin to redirect the original course of your life to allow for their inclusion.   Is this as good as it gets?  If so, the knowledge of your existence alone makes me want to be a better woman.   Alas, unrequited love is a bitch and she's spiteful.  Whatever flaws or inadequacies I possess that prevent you from being able to envision me as your significant other… my only retort is… I am who I am!   I just pray that as I walk through life, I will find another like you who doesn't see me as his Little Sister.

      Funnily enough I heard an interesting theory on Ashanti yesterday, everybody (well those that I know) are like "How does she achieve so much in terms of record sales and accolades when all this average looking girl (she’s no Halle Berry, Jada Pinkett-Smith etc) can do is carry a tune…(she so talentless I don’t even know why I capitalised her name…ashanti  (ah that’s better)  Anyway according to Shelly’s sister in law what happened was ....ashanti had a near death experience and that’s how she met Satan (nah I’m not capitalising his name either because he is a bad man… so satan was like yo wassup, you wanna make a million and go back home to NY, and she was like okay, then satan said okay sign here & the rest is history…  IT’S THE ONLY LOGICAL EXPLANATION. I’m convinced!!!!!

      Yes I'm going to state the obvious...men and women are just different and whilst one tries to embrace these differences, you sometimes stop and think "Why the hell did he do that"?  I find men are great as friends especially with my personality type (I can't stand girlie females) (Does that make me an Alicia Keys type?) but when you start dating them, your expectations of them rise and consequently they start pissing you off.  I'm not at all implying that it's the man's fault....we just interpret each others actions differently....It's the truth....not only because Simone says so but because Dr Phil McGraw did (Oprah show).  What men perceive to be nagging is more likely a demonstration of love (right now you're like... What is this bitch talking about??).  Think of parenting, I remember just hating my mother from the ages of 7 to 14 (the discipline years) but now I understand why she did what she did!  Only stupid men don't watch Oprah, her show is like a language translation device for “Oestrogen” a language most men do not understand.  Women do not need to watch any show to understand men because the ancient language of "Testosterone" (well according to Chris Rock) is based on three simple phrases, Feed me, Fuck me & Shut the fuck Up  :0)  I can only speak for myself but I've stopped listening to what people say because words mean nothing, people will demonstrate their feelings towards you.  So a fight means nothing unless she stabs you in your sleep which means " I hate you and I want you dead" (you see, actions speak volumes).  Start worrying with you reach that very special place in your relationship.   In summary with everything in life you have to look for the positives and arguing adds some dramatic excitement to the day and the best part of all is the make-up sex :0)

      I accidentally agreed to go to my friends house for dinner....you know those times when you really don't want to go somewhere but you can't think of a good enough excuse in time, so all you can do is say YES...well it was one of those times.  I'm no snob but these people are from my "ghetto past"...yeah I used to live in the hood.  For example... the conversations moves to cinema and I say "Yeah Bowling For Columbine was probably the best film I've seen this year" ......all I get in return are blank expressions.....I try again "You know the Michael Moore documentary" and then they all look at me like I'm short then someone asks "What... they show documentaries at the cinema?"....I then decided to spend the entire evening starring into space whilst they continued their enlightening conversation about the best ways to spend money they didn't have.   Don't you just love the ghetto fabulous!!!!!

      Hoes they may be but they are hoes with heart :0) It's funny, I have absolutely nothing in common with the characters but for the most part I can relate.  When you boil the show down to its essence, they are just a bunch of women looking for love but making life complicated for themselves...@ times we can be our own worst enemy.  It's like those women who say they want an unpredictable, spontaneous and exciting man and get pissed when he isn't at home waiting for their call...Some of us don't really know what we want or more importantly don't appreciate what we've got....I believe that human beings have been conditioned to believe that the grass is always greener on the other side and I guess the show reflects that fact very well.

      I stopped by my aunt's flat because it was too late to go back home from my girlfriend's house.  So I'm there chilling (because the rest of the household is in Freetown and the asylum seeking aunt is out on the town) and I notice a shadow scurry across the kitchen counter (a window separates the kitchen and sitting room) I think nothing of it as I used to live there, so I tell myself it must be me because I'm the only living organism in the house.  Oh how wrong was I.  An hour later a FUCKING MOUSE appears from underneath the dinning table and looks at me and mumbles something in Creole...it wasn't in English because the mouse must have come from Freetown with asylum-seeking-Aunty-Joyce a.k.a. Mantan (long story for those few beings who haven't watched Bamboozled)  because I have never seen a mouse in a London home.  Basically what happened was, I saw the mouse in the living room at 02:10:20 secs and at about 02:10:22 secs I was upstairs on the top bunk of my cousins bunk bed trying to recover from the shock of it all...I still can’t believe it GGGRRRROOOOSSSSSSSSS! Reliving that night has made me too distraught to continue this blog...I have to end it right now so I can find a corner of the room where I can rock myself to sleep :0)   According to my friend Yusuf there are more rats/mice than people in London!!!

      "Black Like Beckham" A "controversial programme" it was NOT, a stupid programme it WAS.  In the past, Channel 4 provided programming, which appealed to black audiences when other stations wouldn't.  Now it seems Channel 4's ethos has changed and the channel now broadcasts programmes, which promote negative stereotypes about black people (Ali G..need I say anymore).  "Black Like Beckham" was the straw that broke the camel's back as some could argue "Ah leave Ali alone cos it's funny" but the programme "Black Like Beckham" had no redeeming qualities. it was just pathetic.  Beckham's appeal is simple: men like football thus men like Beckham!!!!  Why make it a race issue as if the following is true and Beckham regularly indulges in a curry, will next weeks programme be "Indian Like Beckham".  Me thinks NOT!  I probably wouldn't have bothered to send this email if a programme of this calibre was on at a time it should be (1 am) but it was on prime time television and not once but twice in THE SAME WEEK!!!!!    This leads me to believe that Channel 4 executives felt this programme was either extremely important or believed we all would be happy to see it.  My question is: who is the "ALL". The UK population who like to listen to a little 50 Cent when driving to the town house in the country because it wasn't black people?  I am eager to know why this programme was aired and if it is so easy to air trash on terrestrial TV I'd like the name of a Channel 4 representative as I feel I could investigate why I think the sky is not really blue but a kind of greyish blue.  Hey we could call it "Greyish Blue Like The Sky".  All I can say is thank God for satellite/cable as I refuse to watch Channel 4 until they stop reducing the entire black experience into a rap video stereotype.  www.channel4.com/4later/newform.cgi

      One night whilst channel hopping my cousin and I happen upon the US phenomenon that is the "Anna Nicole Show"  WOW!!!!! or as Blackstreet once said "Wizzy Wizzy.... Wizzy Wizzy WOW!"  Next comes probably the most profound statement I've ever heard....cue my 15 year old cousin....."I'd pray for her but I don't think it would help"......According to my cousin not even God, the omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent...omni-everything can help Anna Nicole Smith.

      some IG'NANT lady @ work amazed the hell out of me on Sat (but I remained calm...don't worry no blood was shed)....She walks up to the counter... from her demeanour my intuition was already signalling that "Hey , this one's going to be trouble"....then she opened her mouth..."Do you have that Mariah Carey song with that coloured fellow"  (from her use of the word fellow I thought okay she's not from these parts so I'll go easy on her)  So I answered very politely "Yes we have that cd but "coloured" is a politically incorrect term and many "black" people find its use offensive"  I just expected her to say sorry but hey I guess for a few moments I must have been deluded by optimism because her reply was "Well I'm old fashioned"...then she walked away....What can you say eh?  I was speechless, to be honest I still am....I need closure!!!  Stupid Woman ...ah I feel much better now....(and to add insult to injury it ain't even Mariah's song).   On that note I had the misfortune of watching Queen Latifah's "Bringing Down The House".  Again I'm lost for words!!!!  In the movie the only plausible explanation for a black woman living in a white man's home was because she was the nanny/maid... the words "Aunt Jemima" and "Yes Massa" were even incorporated into the script ...come on now!!!  The movie sent out a really negative message about race relations, which is a shame.  Maybe I'm naive but I thought the appropriate parties had already received that message, you know that one where we don't judge people based on stereotypes....(I'm so glad I didn't pay to see it).

      What a surreal experience seeing him live and even though I had good seat (15 rows from the stage) I still didn't get that it was a live performance and felt like I was watching one of my many Chris Rock DVDs/videos ....The audience was 70 - 80% white which surprised the hell out of me.....the white guys behind us were cracking up at every joke but the husband of the couple ahead needed his wife to explain the ins and outs of the jokes....which of course provided me with extra entertainment at no extra cost....Husband to wife "Honey...what are rims"....Wife to husband " You know those things people put on their cars where the wheels keep spinning" I nearly died!!!  One of the jokes Chris Rock performed  was that as human beings we have two options in life to be....A: Married and Bored or B: Single and Lonely When you are married and bored you want to kill your partner and when you are single and lonely you want to kill yourself!!!!! A met a couple who where the perfect example of what it is to be "Married and bored"...the dinner conversation went a little something like this...."Oh the children are so funny....Alice (okay you know ain't no black kid called Alice but as I was half listening to the boring conversation I didn't catch the children's names)...Alice said to her younger brother......Give me my Barbie!!....and he said....No you have to say please!!!!!!   So the Alice says........Please can I have my Barbie Please and her brother says..........(Wait for the punch line) ....You're Welcome.........so I'm sitting there thinking this story ain't funny worth a damn....but everyone else is cracking up.......I'm not even going to bore you with the rest but know this....... that was the funniest anecdote they had.

      I'm convinced......It must just be me!!!!!!!!!!!!  With all the problems I was having back in London ....it seems that the problem is ME cos now I seem to be the thorn in the backside of Cecil, my 33 year old male cousin (once removed (I think that's right)) and his girlfriend Jalika!!!   Basically the house is split on three levels....Melvina, my female cousin, her son and myself sleep upstairs; the living room/dinning area and kitchen are on the ground floor and my Cecil and Jalika have a bedroom and living room in the basement but they use the living room area as a bedroom (why is this important.... because that area doesn't have a door)   Prelude....Anyhoo late one night I'm watching TV and Jalika comes up and says "Can you turn the volume down" .....I'm not aware how sounds travels and as it is late ...fair enough!!     On Friday night I'm in the living room (it's 9:30pm) I'm having a phone conversation with Cece in the living room and being the funny Mo Fo that she is...she is cracking me up!!!!  So I'm laughing....next I hear Cecil shouting at the top of his voice "SIMONE, SIMONE some people are trying to sleep down here!!!!!"......Now I'm vex....cos it wasn't that serious...remember it was 9:30pm.......  As we all know how sensitive I is....I go upstairs as it is in my best interest to prevent a bad situation from getting worse.   When I approach him the following day (Saturday), telling him not to speak to me using that tone he says "I only shouted to be heard, not because I was mad...ask Jean Claude, I don't get angry".  Yeah that explanation may seem plausible to you but you know me....I like to read between the lines.  [ME READING BETWEEN THE LINES] Firstly, why would you ask me, a 23 year old female to ask my 9 year old cousin (twice removed (I think I'm getting good at this family tree stuff (I mean I hope))) if you have a temper?  My interpretation...you see me has a kid (as you want me to consult with a pre-pubescent child) thus do not have the same respect for me as you would your peers.  Secondly, you would have never done that to Melvina (his older sister)......He hugs me and if I didn't accept the gesture and be cool....I'd be the asshole in the situation.......so I let it SLIDE.   Today  (Sunday) was the icing on the cake, Jalika (who I believe until this evening I get on well with) asks if I wanna go to the mall with her....so we go and share a pleasant afternoon.... WARNING FEMINIST CONVERSATION @ THE MALL (sometimes I should just shut up): I get into Feminist mode when she mentions that she is going to "cook some spinach for (her) man".  I ask if Cecil expects her to cook and she gets defensive and says "No, I know he likes African food so I choose to cook it for him"  My next question is, "So what household chores does he do?"...she replies "Well he goes to work" and then mentioned the odd occasions when he does the laundry and yesterday when he vacuumed the basement.....Later on that day she brought the subject up again.....I'm thinking to myself...Damn!!!!  Looks like I've opened a can of worms cos I ain't thinking about that conversation anymore so why is she.  When we get home she starts cooking....As I haven't been able to get into contact with Sabastian for a while...I try him again and we talk for about an hour and a half, then I make a couple of calls to London and go back downstairs....all the lights are off and she is in the basement (probably with "her man") as has been the case 80% of the time this weekend because Melvina and her son are away for the weekend.......... (generally they spend most of their time together downstairs, the only time I really get to speak with Jalika is when he is not there)    ANYHOO I get something to eat..( IN HINDSIGHT: I guess she hears the pots making noise so) she comes upstairs (at the time I didn't know why because she went right back downstairs).....About 10 minutes later she comes back upstairs, sits by me and tells me the following "Something is really bothering me, you know when you said 'does Cecil expect you to cook for him all the time'", I interject thinking that she revisiting the subject matter for a third time ...Then she says "No it's not that....it's YOU" Who Me...I start thinking about what I could have possibly done to upset her.......She continues "After all your talk about me cooking for Cecil, when we got home you didn't help me cook but you were the first to eat and I don't think that's right"  Now I'm floored, what can I say....I didn't have a cold calculated cunning plan to get out of cooking and be the first to enjoy the fruit of her blood, sweat and tears....Only for a millisecond I wanted to jump into "Rude Jude" mode (Yes I apologise for having watched the Jenny Jones Show) and say "Well I thought you enjoyed cooking.....Oh I'm sorry.....only for your man...right?" BUT as I have to live with Jalika and Cecil (who would also become my arch enemy if I said that) for the next 7 weeks I'm not trying to ruffle any feathers.... so when I'm not quite sure who is the winner in the battle of righteousness I just apologise...so I said "Sorry" and she went downstairs.   I guess I really have mastered the art of pissing people of......do you think I can get a internationally recognised qualification for that??  I'm joking right now but I was really upset....yes I'm sensitive!!!  So what are the rules I can only eat if I "hep out" or if I don't help with the preparation of the meal I must wait until everybody else has eaten......(errr excuse me I have a question...What if y'all ain't ready to eat yet...how long to I have to wait)   Boy right now I'm sitting here thinking I can't live with anyone...... is it I who is lacking in "the social skills"?  I don't understand HUMAN BEINGS!!!!   My plan for the next 7 weeks of my vaction.... exile myself in the uppermost chamber of the castle...and live on a diet of toilet paper and tap water!!!!

      The flight was a nightmare.....Never Ever fly with UA....his particular plane didn’t have any personal TVs, so they have to play crap PG films on this horrible projector....it was like flying in the 1980's no joke.  But worse than that was the fact that the Air Stewards had no concept of "respecting ones personal space" I had a chose between these two options (like in "Fight Club") either their crotch or butt IN MY DAMN FACE!!!!!!!!!!!  Once or twice I would have been okay with it but it was every bloody time they walked down the aisle.....Even when I was standing in line to use the toilet one UA stewardess just walked straight into me..but I didn't say anything because I ‘m not even trying to get done for "Air Rage" like Adam Sandler in "Anger Management" .............Boy don't even let me get started about the way they kept knocking the cart into my person....I got to the point where everytime they passed I got scared.....especially when they started serving tea and coffee because prior to that, one steward had spilt mineral water down my arm!!!!!!!!  YES IT IS ALL ABOUT VIRGIN......GOD BLESS RICHARD BRANSON AND NO PLACE ELSE (Head of State).  Okay so I get to the immigration after the horrible flight only to come face to face with the Immigration officer from the lower echelons of HELL.....Check this guy out...."What is the purpose of your visit?"  I'm like fair enough question so I answer "To visit my family"...."How long will you be staying here?" Another expected question ...."10 weeks" I reply....Here's where it starts going pear shaped....."10 weeks that a long time to visit family!!!!"  Boy knowing how these people are I do the best thing I can and shut what they call the fuck up......Then a barrage of questions follow...this time I'm seeing the other passenger flying by but here I am stuck...I thought this MF was going to book an interview room / or deny entry ...OR BOTH!!!!  What do I do in London? What degree am I studying? etc.....Then he spends quite some time looking at the computer screen which from my angle is nothing but a black screen, so right now I'm anxious cos it would be damn shame to come back to England after an eight hour flight.....Anyway after what seemed to be an eternity he lets me go.....Phew!!!!!!

      My friend and I go to a club "Republic Gardens" in DC and initially we are pleased that we are the youngest people in the club (sick of having to be in the company of children when I go out).....the average age was 35....then as the night went on we saw some disturbing images ....women in their mid to late 30's singing along with rap records.... word-for-word......It was a sad & sorry sight....These women must have said the following as they got ready for their night on the town...."Lord I've only got 2 more weeks of youth left in me.....please Lord let me find a man....let me find a man!!!!!"  Obviously as 35 was the average age there were also some OLD men in there... I swear I saw a man in his 60s doing the two-step!!! I had a good ole laugh...especially when two brothers in there were giving these two Oriental girls a little too much attention...okay one of them was well put together but the other looked like..... let me see.....Well let me put it like this......if China ever felt the need to broadcast their own version of "Family Matters" there would be no need to hold a casting session for the role of Steve Eurkel (Am I bad?????)

      "Freddie Kruger Legs" is what they'll call me   Earlier this evening I'm on my way out to meet the girls...you know its a Friday night and I can breathe properly again (??? I am recovering from a cold ). I'm running late cos I'm black...not my fault...genetics !!! So I just hop on any bus in the general direction...they run every 2 mins in London...literally hundreds of them 24/7…I digress (for the benefit of US viewers)!!!   I get of the bus, fail to notice a plastic cord on the street...TRIP!!!!! Yes Trip and gash my knee...TO THE MOTHER FUCKING WHITE MEAT!!!!!!!!THE PAIN. Because I am who I am, my pride is hurt more than my knee (well at that moment) so I quickly pick my ass up...yes I TRIPPED NICELY...THE GOOD TRIP!!! and find a corner to SHAKE in and get over the shock of it all.    At this point the "Evening Standard" (London Newspaper) guy is looking at me...and I'm thinking bitch unless you have a band aid FUCK OFF!!!! Its times like these that you don't really want company...especially the company of a stranger so I hobble home and now my knee feels like Hell's fires are burning on it . However not as much as when I put salt on it...as instructed by my friend....YES I SCREAMED....I did the same the last time I fell over...I think it was the summer of 1987. Now my best asset is RUINED!!!!!!! I AM SO UPSET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Yes my legs were once my best asset...now my left knee looks like Freddy Kruger's face AAAAARRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!!   Well at least it isn't both knees ...maybe I can put an eye patch on lefty and call myself " I kneed Willie"  yes I'm a Goonies fan!!!! I'm surprised that I've got jokes....it looks hideous and it really hurts... I can't even bend it!!!  I was so close to crying but Regents Street is too public a street for that!!!
