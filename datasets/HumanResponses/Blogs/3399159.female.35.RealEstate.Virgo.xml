      On Wednesday's &quot;The O'Franken Factor&quot; on  urlLink Air America  urlLink  Radio , host Al Franken spoke (over the phone) to a group of Conservative listeners at a Dallas Bar-B-Que restaurant he had once visited and promised to return to. When given the mic, two different people, a man and a woman, admonished Franken for &quot;criticizing the President in a time of war&quot;. Both times the comments were made, hoots, cheers and applause of delight filled the room around the speaker.  Franken defended his criticism as being honest and deserved, but failed to justify his right, dare I say even HIS DUTY, to criticize a wrong in hopes to right it. Al should have asked them if they would have &quot;blindly supported the President in a time of war if Bill Clinton were still President&quot;. I don't know why he didn't. In the past, Franken has successfully pointed out that Republicans never once refrained from viciously attacking President Clinton while we had troops in Bosnia or Somalia. And when he attempted to bomb Osama bin Laden in Sudan (if I'm not mistaken) in 1998, the Right was screaming &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, suggesting that the bombing was simply a ploy to distract us from the Lewinski scandal.  I found it disturbing to hear people *cheering* in the background when Al was being chastised for &quot;criticizing the President in a time of war&quot;. It always makes me think of Orwell's 1984, where an entire country was afraid to speak out against a government that existed in a perpetual state of war... perpetuated for that very reason: to control the masses and stifle dissent. Is that what we want? All a President needs to do is keep us in a perpetual state of war to ensure that no one can criticize him or his policies?  Thomas Jefferson said, &quot; Dissent is the HIGHEST form of patriotism &quot;.  Adolf Hitler's Reich-Marshal Hermann Goering said, &quot; [T]he people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country. &quot;  Dare I be crude for a moment and question how many of those Rednecks have even read &quot;1984&quot;?

       You may have heard by now that the  urlLink New York Times apologized  Wednesday for not being critical enough of its own stories on the subjects of Iraq and &quot;Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot; over the past year. The editorial appearing in their Wednesday Edition blames the failure on its own editors for failing to challenge its reporters on the facts they were reporting, as well as depending too heavily on the veracity of now-discredited INC (Iraqi National Council) leader  Ahmed Chalabi .    Competing papers are criticizing the  NYT  &quot; urlLink for not highlighting the close connection between Mr Chalabi and a New York Times reporter, Judith Miller, who wrote many of the articles. &quot;    It was barely 12 months ago that the same paper was rocked by scandal when one of its reporters, Jayson Blair, was discovered to be making stories up, stories that were sometimes sold and reprinted in newspapers across the country. That scandal resulted in the resignation of one of its lead and deputy editors. In Wednesday's 1,100 word editorial, the NYT cites six &quot;misleading&quot; stories, four of which were either written or co-authored by Miller.    &quot;Looking back, we wish we had been more aggressive in re-examining the claims as new evidence emerged -- or failed to emerge&quot;, states the article.    Doug Clifton, editor of the  Cleveland Plain Dealer , had run two of the questionable Times stories on its front page, and then found its self in the unenviable position of having to scramble to get the correction on page 2.    This adds new meaning to the term &quot;coalition of the willing&quot;, only this time, it is the willingness of a major newspaper to maintain a reputation as a news leader and its editors willingness to believe what was being reported enough to not question what was being reported. Unfortunately for them, the end result was that  they now are  less respected  and  less credible  . Who will trust them the next time they make a claim?    Gee that sounds familiar! Haven't we seen this somewhere before? Like, say, when a President goes to the UN to prompt war over a nonexistent threat and then wonders why the UN doesn't trust him when he goes back a year later?

      The most interesting news today/Friday was the likelihood that Kerry will postpone accepting the Democratic nomination at the DNC Convention July 29th because once you've accepted the nomination, you can't raise any more money. The Republican Convention isn't until September 2nd... yes, New York in September. Can they be any more obvious? Gee, you don't think they're using 9/11 for their political gain, do you? You'd think they'd want to avoid reminding voters of being behind the greatest intelligence failure in our nations history, then used that event to justify waging a pre-ordained war against an uninvolved country under false pretenses, and as a result let the guy that  was  behind 9/11 to get away and actually make the problem worse. But they've done a PHENOMENAL job of spin to convince their supporters that they are strong on defense and have actually made us safer as a result. Of course, it helps to have a willing audience that so desperately wants to be believe the Party they support is infallible.  By delaying acceptance of the nomination, Kerry can raise money for an additional 5 weeks, matching the Repugnacans fundraising dollar-fo-dollar.  Too much.

      In Houston, ultra extreme Right-wing talk radio host  Dan&nbsp;Patrick , upset that Houston's only major newspaper,  The&nbsp;Houston&nbsp;Chronicle , was printing too many "anti-Bush" stories as of late, announced his own online "Newspaper" called (dig the irony) "Chronically Biased".  It should be noted that Patrick is not claiming the stories in Houston's only paper are  *wrong* , only that the paper appears (to him) to have taken on an anti-Bush slant because of all the negative "anti-Bush" news it has been reporting recently. Patrick declares that his new "paper" will  watchdog  the far larger Houston Chronicle.  Don't you just love this solution? Don't like the news? Write your own!  (PS: Houston: my hometown. Home of Enron, Arthur Anderson, Halliburton, George Bush Sr, Bush Intercontinental Airport, and more Right-wing talk radio hosts than any other city in the nation... including one of Patick's own co-hosts, Jon Matthews, who was  urlLink indicted on charges of Child Molestation late last year ... I&nbsp;couldn't make this crud up if I tried.)

      The Middle East is exploding in violence. The budget is not the only "deficit" this Administration has created... but a "moral" deficit as well, run by a thief to the Presidency that praises God while being the single greatest source of evil in the world, jeopardizing both our safety and financial future.   Who knew that "Leave No Child Behind" was not their "education" policy but in fact their "military" policy?   Claiming to be a friend of the environment while gutting environmental laws, rolling back existing legislation on some of the most notorious corporate polluters in history.  Illegal price-fixing collusion with the Saudi's has produced the highest gasoline prices in history, along with promises to bring prices back down in time for the November elections.  They started an unnecessary war with one of the few secular nations left in the Middle-East; a country that had not attacked us, had been disarmed and was under control, resulting in the needless deaths of hundreds of American soldiers and more than 10,000 Iraqi civilians; turning what wasnâ€™t a haven for terrorist into just that.  They turned a global outpouring of sympathy and compassion for the U.S. after 9/11 into a global loathing and even seething hatred of all things American.  The nightmare is spiraling out of control and no one in this Administraion can understand why. It's time to TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK and send this neo-fascist regime back to Crawford!
