      Is it wrong to want more?  I lived in a community where the notion ' be thankful and grateful for what you have" is championed I totally understand the essence of such wisdom  And I do not doubt the importance of gratefulness but  I cannot help wondering whether the idea is wildly propagated only to validate complacency and laziness and the killing of dreams  I am utterly grateful for what Allah had bestowed upon me But deep inside I felt that Allah created me to become the best I can be and the Only way for me to achieve that, to have the motivation to strive,  to become the best  is for me to feel some kind of dissatisfaction about my current state and to change that  But to express dissatisfaction- always left me misunderstood As if I am ungrateful The two are not the same thing- they are not Am i over-demanding? Or am i simply in the wrong crowd?  Since college, none of my friend ever studied as hard as I am I tried befriending the Rector's daughter in the hope that she has her father's zeal for academic excellence but alas, clubbing and socializing interests her more  I only wanted the best guy for a boyfriend I never wanted to be 2 kg overweight-it has to be the perfect figure  I must always be the best in class- outspoken and confident and  the most breathtaking which is hard- because I am plain looking without lipstick And it doesnt matter that I have to wake up at 6.00 daily for gym and eat one proper meal a day   Though at times it strained me to the point of collapse I cant help but wondering if what I'm doing is good enough My all or nothing attitude is destroying me, I know And in the end,  I ended up with no bf, 5kg excess overweight - I'm so tired now after work i have no time nor energy for gym bad skin- hmm...  I'm not exactly at my ideal picture of perfection these days But I have never thrown away that idea completely Because I know  That one day  I'd be perfect again Better than last time  Because I know and I believe THAT YOU ONLY GET AS HIGH AS YOU EXPECTED  Who knows? I might marry that perfect guy  one day and I'd nabbed that perfect job - with the penthouse office and there's a Dr. pronounced before my name And i'd live happily ever after  Because you know what, my idea of perfect might not be what 'perfect' means to you and thats ok  Because I want to live MY perfect life Not yours.

      I want a larger than life existence. I want not to conform. I want to live with full conviction and vigour and when i die i want  people to benefit from me. I  will be something. I am history in the making.

      Alhamdulilah, I received my PTD news this week- Pass  Am to go for a three days assessment at INTAN Tengah on Sept, 17. Really, really hope I'd pass that one too- with flying colours  LAst night, after so many months of " not feeling" I cried again The pain was bearable, no more heart-wrenching pain  nor brain-wrecking depression    but the numbness-after made me so tired I havent felt that way fro almost 6 months now I cant believe reading about how we met how gorgeous and perfect he was to me all those cute ways we did to get each others' attention broke me down to tears After I saw his infidelity , I dont remember half of what I felt for him my unconscious mind must have been doin' its jobb Nowadays, I have to really make an effort to remember an event, or even his face in order for me to see things clear But yesterday, reading my old journal- tore down all the defenses I can see him walking towards me, the way his wavy hair curls at the lower nape of his neck his beautiful smile his voice.  I looked at his picture, felt so much pain gushing towards me and realised that I could not bring myself to tear his picture. I know i would never be completely free until i can do that, but i realised i cannot do it just yet.  My completely new Beginning, I hope, will start on 16th April 2005 for that will be the day i will do that erase every memory of him from my eyes, if not my heart.
