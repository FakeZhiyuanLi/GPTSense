      I was out registering people to vote at folklife (fair), and I was pumped up to do so. But the first person I talk to was some bitchy lady, and yelled get away from me, so I persisted, and she got so mad, :) that was pretty funny. I did get six people to register, so that's awesome. No other student got as many, I was the most confident out of them all. So I was walking along popping up in peoples faces, kind of enjoying it after awhile. Then all of a sudden a black guy came up to me, and I knew right away he was going to hit on me, and he started to act so nice to me. As he was filling out the form he said "oh your so beautiful, and if you ever want to call me, please do." "So are you a high school or college student"? Yeah I'm a high school student, "are you going to be 18 soon"? In his head he was saying are you going to be legal soon? (haha)  I was like uh huh, but I'm tempted to call him, and see what could happen, but he could be a drugy or give me a STD. Well I'll just see how things go.

      It's funny how touching some movies can be. There so dramatic, and visually stunning, but life is never like the movies. One goes into the world thinking it will be a certain way, but then one finds out it's a boring horrible place! Filled with cruel, ignorant people. Of course We all make are own bubbles within the big bubble (world). Then some of us live in are own ideal ness, but to another it might be a horrid experience. Films let us escape into an exciting world. Where there isn't dullness, and it has a interesting ending. Sadly We don't live in that perfect world, that movies betray. It's not always that exciting, and might not work out the ideal way. As a child I thought most people were sensitive, and good willed in there hearts, but it seems like this place is a mess. It's not worth being born into this world, if it's just sadness, and no understanding. But at least at the end of the day we have movies, to let our imaginations come alive!

      I want to move to the Fiji Islands one day. Today I was telling Kelley and Hannah, about how cheap it is to buy an Island, and I want to start my own country. They were coming up with great/crazy ideas, Hannah wanted to rehabilitate sickly animals, and kelley thought communism wouldn't do, but Monism might work. Um, "I don't know about that." Kelley said, and everyone goes nude, Hannah liked that idea. (haha) Awesome, "either be nude or wear robes." I said. The only way some one could eat meat is if they hunted, and everyone would build there own shelter, I want a tree house.:) Probably in the end, it would all turn into Anarki, and Kelley might start eating people, so if I just move to a Fiji Island one day, that would be good enough.

      I've had a desire ever since I can remember, that one day as an adult I would get a convertible car, and drive off alone to some random place, ah. Just me and the glow of the dashboard, as the cool air washes my face clean, in the silence of the desert night.

         My piano teacher (Ben) is really amusing. He's funny most of the time, but then other times he can be quite philosophical. The first class I ever had with him, he was talking about some sort of a piano wind chime, in 50 mile winds, (haha) after giving me all these amazing visuals. He said, "why is a piano black and white"? I've heard that before, but it finely hit me. The piano is so graceful, and all this beauty that comes out of it. It doesn't have to be any flashy colors. Although a technicolor piano would look cool.:) Today I was the only one in class, and he was trying to play Ludwig van Beethoven, I found out he is really hard to play. He was telling me how he had a fun day with his kids, Sunday. They were car pooling back, from the country side, after his kids basketball game. He was admiring the sun, and started to  methodically think about how cars run. How oil comes from Saudi Arabia, which is distilled, into gas, then sold to the public which is distributed through out the car, and the pistons which causes combustion, that turns the axial which then turns the wheels (few). He said, "I can't believe were still using this thing, what a stupid invention". (haha) We both laughed. He decided to ride his bike this moring, and park his car away for a long time, "so it will get dusty, and birds can poo on it" (haha). He didn't completely understand what he was getting at, but I think, it was a reflection on the music he brought in this moring. Beethoven was a very complicated composer, and his realization was to. So in his own way, he thinks through music, when it goes beyond plan words. Since this idea was complicated, and Beethoven is too, that's the best way, he could ponder on it, through music.:)

      Patrick is one of the best people I've ever known. The way he sounds, looks, and just his personally, is awesome! I didn't get close to him, in school this year. I wish I could of.:( I was to shy, I'm shy to much. I probably won't ever see him again, I might have to leave this school, and he already decided to change schools, ah. Today me and my mom went to a show at my school, and my mom told him "how much I like his poem he wrote," of course I've been to shy to tell him myself. "We laugh every time we read it", he said, "that's the only poem I wrote for the class",(haha)  Even if we never cross paths again I'll always have this poem to remember him by.:)   The Epic, and yet pointless battle of the Brain and    the poetry Assignment        Two great warriors stand opposite each                                                                        other         A flash of light!    A crash of thunder!    A setting for an epic fight.      On one side, a proper-force of a thousand                                      swords      Standing tall    It cannot fall    And armed with the sharpest words.      The other side, a brain-tired, and nearly                                                                            insane     But ready to fight    With all of its might    And withstand an immense amount of                                                               pain.     Now for the flight, a great victory shall                                       follow,     With swords in hand    Ready they stand    And the brain cried out, "Man I'm tired, let's                                                                              finish tomorrow!"

      I always have the strangest dreams, ever since I can remember. The first dream I can remember, was when I was 5 years old. I was on a boat in the middle of the ocean with my mom, dad, and brother I think my aunts and grandfather was there to. When I lived in Florida around 3 & 4 during holidays we use to go out on my aunts boat a lot, and my dream had the same setting as that boat, but it seem like we were in the middle of the Pacific in this funky little boat that could only handle intracoastal waterways and coastline. It was a bright sunny day in my dream I was sitting on the edge of the boat and I was in my swimsuit I fell backwards into the water I could see my family through the water panicking above me on the boat, I was falling back slowly, I wasn't scared at all I could of very easily swum back up, and I would of been safe, but I wanted to go swim (I'm a water baby) :). As I swam father down it became darker until there was no light, and I realize I could breath, but right away I could feel something was wrong. The water had a grey smog color that's what was making it so dark. I looked at the floor of the ocean and there was no life it was competely dead, just sand, I felt this sadness in my heart, and I kept saying to myself, this is wrong, this is wrong what have humans done to the earth. Then I felt like something was  behind me, following me. One part of me was thinking it might hurt me, and the other part of me was thinking it might want help, so I just kept swimming. Then I swum around, it was the skeleton of a shark, but it still seem to be alive, it was swimming and moving around just like a normal shark would of been. It quietly swam away. Then I notice off to the side there was this huge pyramid of shark skeletons stack on each other. I felt so shocked, and depressed. How could this happen? From then on I've never forgotten that dream it's been 12 years since I had it. I know it doesn't sound like a 5 year old would have a dream like that, but I don't know why I have such strange dreams, maybe I'm a schizophrenic, and it only comes through my subconscious. I learned how beautiful and delicate, this world is, and it made me the person I am today. I respect and care about things deeply, and I hope the world as a whole will start too.

      Today In Physiology Class we were learning about the female sexual organs, it was quite interesting, my wonderful sponsor (Flora) of my grade is helping teach the class with the biology teacher (Mr. Busse). Flora is an Art teacher, but there's a lot of art incorporated in our classes, so that's why she's helping. She was so passionate about explaining the way pregnancy works, it made me have a deep admiration for it. I was thinking today if some boring professor tried to lecture about it in front of students in a college, how I'd fall asleep fast. But she had something no learned man could ever fine in a textbook, an understanding beyond words, about pregnancy. She said something very beautiful that I won't ever for get about pregnancy, I'll always associate with pregnancy now, "Bones are like Frozen music." She was saying that pregnancy is like a dance, and that quote is a beautiful way to sum it up. Also she's a cancer and it makes sense why she seems well at understanding pregnancy in a better way then most people I've ever known of. She has an ability to capture the beauty of pregnancy that normble people don't have, it's just something you feel. From the begging of the year of knowing her I always told my mom when Flora becomes a mother, she'll be one of the best, it's in her soul.

      I've Been wanting to do a journal for a while now, so this is great for me, I'm not wasting paper, and its endless what you can store in this thing. But there's one thing on here that's making me paranoid how when ever you post something it tells you the exact date and time, so it really makes you realize how fast every thing is going by and you're wasting away. You feel you shouldn't be in here typing your life away, you should be out accomplishing great things with your life, ah. But you don't always have the ability, to do what you want in life, so you end up not doing to much then as soon as you know it you're in here writing your heart away.

      Billowing suns stain the barren plains. Forsaken worlds cry, it's filth away.  Look far and wide nothing remains. Billowing suns stain the barren plains. As the lone stranger expains: The damned beings brought only decay. Billowing suns stain the barren plains. Forsaken worlds cry, it's filth away...

      Two worlds dreamt each other away. World view drew another persona. Nother paths unreal, never cross ways. Two worlds dreamt each other away. Far off sit Sadhus; in Bombay. Ancient fabrics weave; latest Kimono. Two worlds dreamt each other away. World view drew another persona.

      I was supposed to be a man, or at least I want too be.:) This being a female isn't working out.  It's to much work, for nothing that great. I would of been a kick-ass guy. Sure each sex can have just as much fun as the other, but being gay looks like SO much fun. If I was a gay-guy I'd actually want to get all doll up, and wear mini skirts. Anyway gay-guys look like they have the best sex life, a hell of a lot more fun looking then heterosexual people. Woman are always complaining that they don't orgasm, and all men care about is taping that ass. And not caring about the sensitive female feelings. It's an outrage the heterosexual world is not working out. Yes, one way, and only one way, heterosexuality is good, to reproduce, But that's it. After that's done what is there? I'll tell you what's left Divorce court, and therapy. But do gay couples experience that? No fucking way bitch.:) There do busy enjoying awesome sex, when your done sucking your daddy off, he dose it back. Now what's better then that in life, I don't think much. So in my next life I'm coming as a flaming queen, see you next time ladies.

      I had this dream when I was 11, that I was this grown person, and me and my mother were at this formal art college party. In this big beautiful white marble room, there was a fare amount of people, and every one was walking around socializing. Everyone was dressed to the tea. They were so happy to welcome me to the college, and the Dean was bragging to my mom how quite impressed he was with me, and he seemed to admired me a lot. There were waiters walking around handing out champagne, so I grabbed one, not really wanting to drink it, but I did anyway. I was standing there with my mom, and she was having an intense conversation with the Dean, and drifting off, I started to observe the surroundings. (Which I do a lot in my daily life.) I noticed there were men walking around, but they weren't normble human men. They all had bird heads, like love-bird features. It didn't surprise me, I thought it was perfectly fine. I had the sudden urge to go explore, and get away from the crowd, so I handed the champagne to my mom, and said I'm going to go look around. I started up this big beautiful white marble staircase, walking beside me was another bird headed man. We glanced at each other as we walked by, he had very stern bird eyes, not about to start up a conversation. But I liked that. Soon I came to the second landing, and was totally alone, and all I could hear was my footsteps, against the hard marble floor, echoing off the high marble walls. There was nothing here but a curved entry way, which was pitch black blocking someone from seeing the next room. And on both sides there were sculptures of the same shapes, which were bright solid colors. I walked through the dark entry, hoping to find a room filled with interesting things. But all I found was this room looked exactly like the first one, and on the far end there was another entry way, with sculptures on both sides. I was still eager to keep exploring, the anticipation was building. I was thinking why would they build something that just went on and on, with empty rooms that all looked alike. There had to be something good at the end! So I walked through the next entry, into another room that was the same as the others, I thought how long can this go on for? I began to feel I was in an Escher painting, that just kept going in  circles. The art college, became the art. So I walked through another and another entry, but then I came to one room that had two entries. I walked to the entry on my right. It didn't have sculptures on both sides, which all the other entries had until this one I came across. This time I didn't walk through right away, it was pitch black like the other entries, but this time I just peered into see where it went. It didn't lead into another big bright marble room, but had two endless halls going off in opposite directions. I stopped and thought if I go in here, I'm going to loose myself. In that moment I began to feel frighten. I turned away and began walking to the other entry, still determined to see if there was an end to this place. I was going to walk right through the other entry again, when suddenly I stopped abruptly, there was a blue bird-headed man standing in front of me, guarding the entry like a soldier, He was glaring down at me with his stern bird eyes. I grinned mildly at it, hoping it wouldn't attack me. Then I realized it wasn't going to hurt me, but it was protecting me from entering the next room. What ever was on the other side it didn't want me to know, maybe because of the first dangerous brush with the other entry. I was treading ground I shouldn't have been. Then I awoke, absolutely dazzled with the dream I just had. I still wonder about it a lot. Maybe I was walking through my subconscious hallways, and discovering things I wasn't allowed to, so it booted me out.:)  But whatever the dream represented, it stirred me up.

      There is a war brewing! Between whom you ask. My beloved insane dog, (Dandy) and the common house fly. This war has been raging since the first time Dandy laid eyes on the flying maggots. What is it about the provocative house fly, which drives my Dandelion crazy? Maybe its the intoxicating buzzing sound which lulls one to sleep, and makes one want to start whacking things.:) Or the pleasant company of a fly to ones meal, when everyone's left you behind and miserable. There's always a friend in a Flesh burrowing, throw-up eaten fly.:) But what ever the reason maybe, it's one of the zillion mystery of the universe, which is better unsolved.:)

      I want to be a healthy person. I take care of myself well, but it hasn't work that great. My physiology is a goal, that I have to conquer. Until I do, I won't and can't be able to live my life to the fullest. I inherited bad genes, and grew up in a disfunctional family. A perfect recipe, for a physical and mentally broken down person. So what do I do? Where do I pick up the pieces? I have a few goals in life and I'm a determined person, and I will reach them. I want to graduate high school and travel so badly in this life, and nothing in this world will stop me. I will start taking care of myself, until I'm healthy again. I will not go on medication. The doctor is scaring me, saying you probably will or already have inherited those bad genes, that will kill me slowly. Fuck the medical community, they don't know how to crue people. They just know how to make money and get people addicted to medicine. How dose that help a person? It doesn't, I will die before I'll listing to there theories and hypothesis. Because for a scientist "In theory." is a coup-out statement, for I don't know. And they seem to be saying "In theory" a lot. The next time the dumb medical community go on a rant about, I need proof or God doesn't exists because I can't see it. Then maybe they should give a second thought about saying "In theory" again. Because it seems to me there doing the exact thing that they accuse religious people and philosophers of doing. Which is not a correct way of thinking. Because it's not a proven fact. One mustn't be dreaming of into oblivion. Well not everything in this world is a tangible thing, some things are beyond our understanding, were not the holder of brilliance. Far from it. But to these stuck up jerks, everything must make sense, and be proven as a fact. It seems to me there more lost, and delusional, then the people that don't always agree with there theories, and beliefs. So no matter how much people discouraged or frighten me, I will preserver through all the murky waters of my life, and I will come out the victor!

      I just came back from my end of the year school trip, it was wonderful! We went to Victoria, BC. It was just three students and our sponsor (Flora). The fourth student decided not to come, but that was good in the end because we had more money to spend for ourselves. We raised 543 dollars for our trip, so we had a luxurious time.:) we left Friday and came back Tuesday. The first day we left from Seattle to a ferry that took us to Kingston Island. We we're going to drive straight to the next ferry which was two hours away, but we figured out we wouldn't make it in time for the next ferry. So we'd have to take the next one which was leaving at 5:15 PM. By chance there was a Renaissance Fair that we past on the way to our next destination, and since we didn't have to be at the ferry until 5:15, we side tracked and stop at the Fair. It was fun, not exactly my cup of tea, but it was ok.:) One of the other students got a lot of stuff, she was going to have a heart-attack, she enjoyed it so much. (haha) Flora and the two other girls had lunch at one of the food stands. (it was called the Delly Belly Dragon) I didn't get anything to eat, the fair obviously doesn't tailor to a Vegan Diet. Then we left for the two hour drive, which was nice. The two girls we're in the back, and me and flora were in the front. We started talking about travel, and how her sister is doing an exchange ship to Turkey next year. She told me about how a few years back, when she separated from her fiance, she went on a road trip during the winter, all alone. Across the western states of the US. It was enlightening for her. She has always been a very outgoing person, but there would be days where she realized she hadn't spoken to anyone. She slept out of her car, and only had a little bit of money she saved up, she was trying to visit all the national parks. Half way into the trip she realized her car heater didn't work, so she was freezing most of the time. (haha) She ended her trip in California. She took a walk on the beach one day, and finaly in her heart she felt if her fiance left her for good it would be ok.:) Her mother always told her "If you love someone genuninely; you have to let them free, to see if they come back." The funny thing was when she was feeling that, he e-mailed her that they should give each other a second chance, and they ended up getting married a short time later. A true love story I say! We got to Flora's grandmothers house around 7:00, so we decided to do things the next day. Flora's grandmothers house was something out of a story book. It was a separate apartment in a renovated Victorian house. Her grandmother was also something out of a story book, (haha) a sweet old British lady. It was cool, she was also a Vegan. But she didn't have much food, she didn't like eating all together. (haha) She was so tiny. She looked like Flora in sixty years.:) Me and the two other girls walked to the store that night, so I could get some food. On the way there Garima (she's very tall) decided to do funny walks, it was very funny, one was like she just came off a horse, and her legs became bowed outward, or she'd lean back very far and stretch her legs forward. It looked like a super model gone retarded. (haha) It was funny as I was checking out at the grocery, I only had American money, and I don't know the exchange rate, so I said, " Don't go Garima, I don't want the teller to gyp me." The teller man smiled, and I didn't get ripped off. (yay):) The next morning we walked downtown to the heart of beautiful Victoria, grandmother came with us, but she left us at the book store. Munro's Book store was nice, not as great as Flora made it sound. (haha) I got a book by Douglas Couplad, he's some Canadian writer. It's called "All Families are Psychotic." The name attracted me instantly. But I'm finding out it's a dumb story, I hope it gets better later on. (haha) I was going to get a book called Porno, with a blow up doll on the front. But I thought it would be boring. But now compared to this book that one would of been exciting. From there we went to lunch, 'The Green Cuisine'  An all Vegan restaurant. Garima knew about it, because her family is all Vegetarian, and when they go to BC, they like eating there. It was SO yummy. I didn't have a good meal since the other day, so I was very hungry. "I told them I would move here just so I could eat here everyday." It was really cool you served yourself, and you could take as much as you wanted. We ate in a courtyard on a picnic table. It was quiet nice. We talked about Veganism, and how long/ and why I did it. I gave them facts, and of course the protein issue came up. But I told them I don't do it for health, I do it for moral reasons. Flora was raised Vegetarian, but she eats to live, so she eats anything that makes her healthy, and the other student Ilaria, just eats chickens, so there not big meat eaters. After that we went to the National Geographic IMAX Theatre, it was in the local Museum. We saw "The Human Body," it was so awesome. The human body is an amazing thing. That was the coolest Museum, and Imax I've ever been in. It was clean and big, and the seats were comfortable.:) Then we went to the MINIATURE WORLD Museum, it was so funny. It's amazing how diligent the artist are that make each exhibit, and it's all miniature. (haha) All those little details are there, and some exhibits would turn to day and night, it looked very realistic. My favorite exhibits were the plans of Canada, all those little wheat fields, and the circus. The fair turned to night and rides moved and glowed neon, it reminded me of wired up metal local state fairs from my childhood. (haha) We walked home and ended the night with a lovely pasta dinner, and playing a game of SCRABBLE. The next morning we walk to a breakfast place, it wasn't Vegetarian, but I had a plate of potatoes with salsa. But I wasn't full so I was looking forward to dinner. Then grandmother drove us to The 'Craigdarroch Castle' It was really cool. I've never been to a castle, the man that build it died before he could ever live in it. But his wife and tons of kids lived there. My favorite was 'Effie's Bedroom' it was one of his daughters rooms, I could of imagined, being the girl in that room.:) On the third floor Garima played an 100 year old piano, and Flora & Ilaria waltzed, it was cute.:) We walked to an art gallery and met back up with, Flora's grandmother. Flora decided to go home and finish grading papers for school. So just the three of us went to the Royal London Wax Museum. Flora didn't want to see the wax figures she said "they give me the creeps." They weren't as real looking as the ones in London. Bush was funny looking, he's so short. I took a picture with Gandhi, Ilaria said it looked weird. (haha) They had a scene of the last supper with Jesus, it was so funny, there was a recording explaining the acounts of Jesus with his followers. Then the room became dark and the voice started to boom saying, 'Three days later Jesus was resurrected.' And Jesus was glowing in the background, it was quite funny.:) Garima was walking by herself just as Jesus started to glow, and she said 'It scared her.' She's silly.:) We walked home, also getting a little lost. I knew we were going the wrong way, right away but they weren't listing, bla. We chilled out for a while, before we were going to go to dinner and Flora went for a walk. Grandmother drove us downtown to a posh modern Vegetarian restaurant, The food was really good. I ordered a strawberry smoothy, and Monk Curry Asian bowl, it was so filling I almost couldn't finish it, but I did.:) Then we all started back to grandmothers house, Garima was playing around with walking again. I was so worn out, the two other girls and Flora decided to go get some ice cream in the neighborhood I split, and went back home to read. They came back an hour later and we played a quiet game of SCRABBLE. Then we all retired to our own books, and fell asleep. The last morning we all woke at 9:30 AM. To get to the ferry in time to get home, grandmother drove us to the COHO, and we went through immigration back into America, it was pretty easy. It was a long ride back to Port Angeles, then drove two hours to Kingston, and borded the next ferry home. It was only 30 minutes, the water is so pretty when you are passing fast over it. You can see the light shooting into it, and it shimmered a different shade of green. It was really beautiful.:) We arrived at 2:30, and drove back to the school. Made it there right at 3:05, and all of our mothers were late to pick us up. But they did eventually, and parted ways, with Garima playing the "why" game. I really enjoyed this trip, I hope I have many more trips in the future, just as fun!:)

      Break my bones, and mind, break my soul cruel world.  Unreal pains, hide the tears, hush the cries.  Dwell in hidden dreams, close off this world.  Break my bones, and mind, break my soul cruel world.  Dull pains hum in the distanced world.  Stranded soul, idle under darken skies.  Break my bones, and mind, break my soul cruel world.  Unreal pains, hide the tears, hush the cries.

       I had this dream last night that I was giving strange men, &nbsp;that I met out of know where blow-jobs. But the weird thing was that, &nbsp;as they would start to become&nbsp;erect, there penises turned into&nbsp;sea&nbsp;&nbsp;creature, so it was frighten trying to suck on them because I didn't know if I would be&nbsp;attacked (haha). So as I was sucking on it;&nbsp;I&nbsp;figured out if I just sucked the sides of the dick&nbsp;the creature wouldn't bother me, but if I sucked it from the front, it would start sucking on me. But even though the penis was some sort of sea creature I still&nbsp; sucked&nbsp;on it with&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;vigor.:)&nbsp; It was a super freaks dream, but I&nbsp;enjoyed&nbsp;it anyhow.

         I went to a "Japanese Garden" today,&nbsp; it was quite lovely, and peaceful. I looked at the map thinking it was this huge place, but it was quite deceiving, (haha) though it was still very pleasant. Everything was miniature, which was amusing, all the trees and planets. In the middle there was this big pond with bridges going over it, which was filled with Coy Fish. There extremely interesting, they seem like aliens compared to us. If you really look at fish, and just animals with clear eyes for the first time in life, it's really amazing. And vs we must look just as strange.:) I fed the Coy, pebbles of food, which they readily enjoyed. They were all climbing all over each other, and popping out of the water to catch some food. The older big Coy crowded in front, and the young new-born were in a school together in the back jumping over each other with youth and vigor. Where as the older ones were slumping all over each other. But te older ones were much more beautiful, there was this huge yellow one that looked like a dragon, and moved along graceful. The sounds they made were funny blob, and gulp, when they'd come above the water, trying to suck in the food. It was a really lovely park, and I hope to see a real Japanese Garden one day much bigger and vast.:)

      Silent man on curb, clutches his dying soul. Gentle gaze watching the world pass by. Eyes glint, of old dreams, shows wasted goals. Silent man on curb, clutches his dying soul. Things push, to fall down an endless hole. Just a mere sigh at the faded sky. Silent man on curb, clutches his dying soul. Gentle gaze watching the world pass by.

      Gazing towards the skies iron bars. Reach in vain, wish to break free. Watching headlights of passing cars. Stunned within this horrid plight.  Sunrise, cased in past: prisons. Chains bind, to break these illusions.   Walk upon lands which featured forgotten wars. Wander on these prairies. Wavering dusts obstructs my sight. Pain shatters: to heaven, pleas. Sunrise, cased in past: prisons. Chains bind, to break these illusions.   Lost dreams shown dim in this cold gleam. Forgotten, friends unseen. Sunrise, cased in past: prisons. Chains bind, to break these illusions.   Lights stream down illuminating my dreams. Endless searches beyond this seen. Sunrise, cased in past: prisons. Chains bind, to break these illusions.

      I own pretty pink pantaloons. Which flutter as I pace along. Strolling dreamly, resented; proclaimed a loon. I own pretty pink pantaloons. Forlorned there gone, taken by goons. A heck I'm switching to thongs.:) Use to own pretty pink pantaloons. Which once fluttered as I paced along.

                              Iquana's Dream  Look back through the window of time, Feeling the smooth palm tree against your belly, The humid air touching your primordial skin, The fading in of color surrounds you Your chest inflates with the smells of the air, Looking at the stars, looking back at you Seeming like an animated rock The remembrance of sound vibrates your head, Like the ancient drums;  Eyes-like gems, reflecting all our dreams The cruel realness swoops down on you Just for a moment, then you dream Once more, back into the grand thought.

      Tension builds, throbs sliding in. Immense presser, thrusting cum deep. Eyes shut, gently rubes against my skin. Tension builds, throbs sliding in. Breathless strokes, hits hard within. Many constricted urges forced down deep! Tension builds, throbs sliding in. Immense presser, thrusting cum deep

      Winding down a silent road. My footsteps shine as I drift away. Seeking to break this vast code. Winding down a silent road. Years past, dreams fade as I erode. Eyes close, forget going astray. Winding down a silent road. My footsteps shine as I drift away.

      Hidden beast within a child's disguise. Flashing blades fall with one blink! Looking round only see blinded eyes. Hidden beast within a child's disguise. Feeling tremors of silent cries. Lingers heavy only a foul stink. Hidden beast within a child's disguise. Flashing blades fall with one blink!

      Forbidden hollows echo lost sighs. Suspect pangs of truths liberate me? Break through these suspended skies. Forbidden hollows echo lost sighs. Fading dreams hidden behind these eyes. Drifting gently through time I'm set free. Forbidden hollows echo lost sighs. Suspect pangs of truths liberate me?

      Behind shrouded tears, in stillness you wait. I don't feel so alone when your here. Locked away and hidden, holds our fate. Behind shrouded tears, in stillness you wait. Through a window, rain falls time grows late. The closer I come, you disappear. Behind shrouded tears, in stillness you wait. I don't feel so alone when your here.

      Human beings, are something else. There filled with all these sickness. insecurities, joy, anger, love, ect. and for all of it, is it worth it? Everyday I live feels like I'm waning away, I'm a wind down toy, that's about to stop. I don't want to be labelled, and I don't care about proving myself to anyone. We have a image of ourselves through the eyes of others, are whole life has been made up of what others said, and what they might be thinking of us, and our whole life and days are filled with these thoughts, am I good enough? I'm better then that. then insecurities step in, and we feel like were not good enough or nothing is satisfying. Then what happens? Whats in front of us, the stupidity of all these insecurities, and we buy into it, ah fuck them all. Hey but even if that sickness wasn't involved with our minds there's plenty of other sickness that can keep us distracted. So our whole life is constantly filled with these sickness, and that is the mind. This spposed beautiful creation, is filled with so many gliches, which when I look at them it seems not worth it. I'm an extremely sensitive person, ever since I can remember. As a child I acted how I felt, but oh no that wouldn't work in this world, so I was beaten down, and became cynical. I didn't turn out to be the person I should of been, who I am on the inside. Now I hide who I really am on the inside, so things won't hurt as much. As humans are always trying to get somewhere, are always in motion, in evey sence. This universe is never ending (maybe:) and for it all please let it be ok.

      My brain feels blurred. My family and I use to live in a crappy Apt. and the new place we moved into isn't much better, actually it's worse, there's only one bedroom and my brother and I have to share it. So I have very little privacy, the view out the front window is a sign of PETCO (Evil Co.) across a highway. Also everyone in my family is unemployed, that's way were in this situation, there's never been a time in this family when it's been calm or peaceful, ever since I was born it's been insane, and right now till this day it's still crazy. And people may wonder what's wrong with that girl, and judge me, but they have know idea, just as I might not know totally there problems but it's so easy to judge, then I think I don't need you, fuck off. When I wake up in the morning with the numb feeling of shoving down pain of past traumas and pretending to the world that I'm fine, and look out the window I don't have a view of the American dream, I behold the sight of a true America, capitalism and consumer's. But I'm not blaming America because my parents are idiots, ( I just said it to be dramatic:) they fucked up in life and my brother and I had to be subjected to there stupidity, It's a pity. By any means I'm not going to dwell in the past and mess up my own life, the first day we moved in here I made a decision that I'm getting my self out of this hell, and I'm going make it to my dreams, and if my life is ever bad I'll never put another life through it, I'll go down that road on my own, and blame know one. Root for me world, peace out.:)

      Life is insane, but you just keep living it, with the good the bad and the ugly.  It could never be the way you'd want it to be, because someone else wouldn't like it,  but it all works anyway, even if  it doesn't work that well. I've been moving recently, (for the millionth time) that's why I haven't posted, But I shall start posting again.:)
