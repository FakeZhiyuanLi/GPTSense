      Days off always make me want to waste time with this kind of stuff, as opposed to doing laundry or dishes or what have you.

      Wow. It's been a while.  I'm completely exhausted from hosting my sister for a week. She is young and single, and I am old and married. I took her out to some of the skankiest clubs you can imagine -- just to find somewhere to dance. I never go out dancing (at least not in Columia), so I had no idea where to go. We had to explore a little first.  Anyway, she wore me out. She wanted to flirt with cute guys, and I just wanted to drink. This turned out to be a satisfactory combination, but I'm glad it was only temporary or else my liver would be a withered, dead husk of its former self. I'm sure it's not in top shape regardless. Also, did you know a Red Bull and Vodka costs eight bucks at Jillian's and the like? Yeesh.  Gooncamp is coming up: April 16-18. If you know what I'm talking about, the registry is  urlLink here . As of this post, there are 57 already! Christ, this is going to be the biggest one yet. I'm excited.

      Today was the grand opening of my family's new project, " urlLink Nana's Kitchen ." I'm eager to know how everything went, but I was stuck at work again today for longer than expected, and didn't get a chance to call.  Apparently the bank down the street was just robbed this evening, within the past few hours. I hope they're not hiding in our laundry shed or something. The cops remain on the lookout. I'm so sick of this neighborhood. Even if we don't leave Columbia this summer, I really don't want to stay  here .   Spring break's almost over. Whee.

      I can't stop listening to  urlLink Shivaree 's Goodnight Moon. This song played during the closing credits (well, just one part of the hour-long closing credits) of Kill Bill Volume 2, and it's  so  not the type of thing I usually go for. Maybe that's why it is so annoyingly addictive.  A couple of nights ago I learned that the security guard at Cornell Arms shot and killed someone. Right there on the street.  urlLink The article in The State  is my only real source of information here. There's been so much gossip going around the sandwich shop, which is unavoidable since it's right there next to where I work. Anyway, this guy comes into the store all the time. I even know what he usually orders; and now, he's been arrested for murder. It gives me a weird, queasy feeling that seems to float around with me all the time. I knew he was into guns, but just to imagine that he had the capacity to kill someone when angered enough is really incredible. Maybe that's not what really happened; who knows?  Just this week -- this week alone -- Cornell Arms has also experienced a fire and a car busting through the first-floor bagel shop windows. Apparently a vortex of evil has opened up shop over there. I hope it goes away soon.  Recently I used my Gooncamp Drinking Tie for a formal catering job. It cheered me up during the 12-hour workday. I can't remember what he paid for these adorably ugly ties, but I doubt it was more than ten cents each.

      I fell in love with Death Cab for Cutie again. A friend, David, was telling me about their live show, and I had to live vicariously as he described their antics. I think my emo gland is swollen again. Summer seems to make it worse.

      Is it so much to ask to have my president speak like  this ? Clinton just gave a knockout speech. "Strength and wisdom are not opposing values." It makes me yearn for the Clinton days, when our president was able to finish sentences and have an ounce of charisma. I bet the ladies were swooning. I know I personally had to stop myself from throwing my underwear at the television.    I'm not sure that Kerry will be able to follow that. Good thing he has a few days to light a fire under the asses of his speech writers. I think Edwards will probably steal the show somewhat on Wednesday, and I'll lament the fact that he's not going to be accepting the big ticket. Maybe down the road, though.    I didn't catch Alston, but he's a Columbia minister. Anyone know where to find a transcript? Eh, I'm just being lazy; I'll find it online someplace.

      I'm screwing around with templates again. I can never leave well enough alone, I guess. I'm half listening to the Democratic Convention and half poking around online.    I just got an email about the  urlLink Future Soundtrack for America  album from the  urlLink MoveOn.org  mailing list. I'd actually heard about this from  urlLink Barsuk Records ' newsletter (Barsuk is releasing it), and now I'm excited to see it actually happening.  urlLink You can get an early copy from MoveOn with a $25 donation . Just look at the artist list! Tom Waits, David Byrne, Death Cab, REM, Nada Surf, M. Doughty; hell, even Elliott Smith (something new that hadn't made it onto his other albums & is being donated by his family). I'm pondering whether to buy it now, or just make my donation and wait until the CD/book package comes out later. The book sounds just as delicious:  The Future Dictionary of America  will include stuff from Dave Eggers, Kurt Vonnegut, Joyce Carol Oates ... and I think I'm just going overboard now with the enthusiastic promotions. Anyway, it sounds neat.

      We were blown away last night by the Art Bar show:  urlLink Eleni Mandell  is wonderful. She has a smoky, sexy voice, and her band plays a wide range of stuff from country to Tom Waits covers. Geoffrey astutely pointed out the similarities between Eleni's voice and that of Ambrosia Parsley of Shivaree, and he said he felt like he was in a Tarantino film. That seemed pretty spot-on, especially with the smoky-fluorescent  urlLink Art Bar  surroundings. Made for a surreal night.     Also fun last night was that David Adedokun (of  urlLink The Daylight Hours ), my fellow wage slave, got the opening slot. He seemed charmingly nervous, but played about six songs and sounded downright gorgeous. He even played "Welcome Back," one of my favorites, and it came off brilliantly. I think he made a good impression.     I'm wasting time by alternately playing  urlLink Syberia II  and finally going back to  urlLink Kingdom Hearts .

      I giggled a little at the new Blogger format; the main user interface is now called the "Dashboard," which makes me think of the emo stereotype of using online journal thingies.  Screaming infidelities ...  I can't really offer myself as an exception, since I too have a weakness for Cursive and all the rest. I guess I'm just helping to solidify the stereotype.     Geoffrey and I are trying to figure out what to do with our lives right now. It's too big of a decision to finish over an Oreo milkshake at Rush's, apparently, so it might take us a while. I've told my bosses that I'm off the roster after August 15th, which fills me with alternating bits of fear and of relief. I can't wait to be done with this job, but I also don't really want the responsibility of a real career. It seems too  grown-up  for someone like me. Right now I have a job that I can immediately forget about when I step outside the restaurant. Shift's over -- no worries. It's a shit job, but it doesn't hang on like it would if it were anything engaging or even slightly interesting to me. I just go, clock in, do simple work and let my mind wander.     Obviously it's time for me to do something real, but it'll be a big change for me. Sometimes I wonder what it'd be like to just keep some crappy eight-bucks-an-hour job for the rest of my life. Every day the same, blending into the next, no corporate ladder or promotions or getting the big account or feeling any sense of intellectual fulfillment. Just working. It's a weird thought. It's definitely enough to motivate me to update my resume and whatnot, because I realize quite clearly that I'm not going to spend fifty years slapping sandwiches together. It's an interesting daydream, though.
