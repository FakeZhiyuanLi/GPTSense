       Faro-Loulé: june 26th 2004  It was yet another penalty shootout to decide the fate of two superb teams. The Netherlands and Sweden had played good football right through the qualifiers and in the initial stages of the tournament. For the dutch, its one step closer to the cup, playing against hosts Portugal in the semi finals, whereas for the Swedes, its a missed attempt at glory, yet again.    Sweden had two changes in midfield from the side that drew 2-2 with Denmark to qualify for the last eight, with Anders Svensson replacing Kim Kallström and Anders Andersson giving way to Tobias Linderoth while Alexander Östlund came in for the suspended Erik Edman in defence. The Netherlands fielded the same team that booked a quarter-final place with a 3-0 success against Latvia.    Both sides took time to settle and the early play was littered with free-kicks. The Dutch began to take the initiative. Robben had the game's first chance after ten minutes, cutting inside before producing a fierce left-foot drive that was pushed aside by Andreas Isaksson. The Sweden goalkeeper was soon in action again to clutch a Clarence Seedorf free-kick as his side were pushed on to the back foot, and Ruud van Nistelrooij then had a shot blocked with the Netherlands looking to take advantage of their opponents early on.   Sweden finally began to ease into their stride, with Henrik Larsson curling a long-range free-kick wide but the game, while interestingly poised, had yet to really catch fire as the half-hour approached, although Michael Reiziger flashed a drive past the post when the Netherlands came forward again.    The second half was quite similar. The Dutch forced the early pace, with Van Nistelrooij troubling the Swedish defence in heading Robben's cross just over the bar and flicking another effort fractionally too high minutes later.    There were signs that the game was coming to the boil. Van der Sar saving a fierce cross-shot from Mattias Jonson as Sweden enjoyed a promising spell near the hour. Back came the Netherlands, with Van Nistelrooij seeing an effort blocked by Isaksson and the ball rebounded off the striker but rolled inches wide. Svensson then tested Van der Sar from outside the area as the tempo increased.    Extra time and the Dutch almost struck within two minutes. Isaksson fumbled Robben's long-range strike on to the post, and substitute Roy Makaay failed to take advantage of the rebound from close range. Two Seedrof efforts were then saved wonderfully by the Swede.   Larsson's effort hit the crossbar at the other end and soon afterwards, Ljungberg hit the post for Sweden in an enthralling climax but it took the drama of a penalty shoot-out to separate the two sides.    Dick Advocaat's side have been bedevilled by shoot-out misery since 1992, going out of the last three European Championships and the 1998 World Cup.   However, this time they survived Phillip Cocu's miss when he hit the post with their fourth kick after Ajax striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic had fired over to pile the pressure on Mellberg. Arjen Robben blasted Holland into the semi finals, by hitting the winning penalty.    All eyes are now set on the match up between the Czechs and the Danes.
