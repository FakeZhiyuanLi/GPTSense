      Let's see... science homework to catch up on, business reviews, French project to get started on, exams to study for... and yet I am not doing any of those things mentioned. *sigh* I'm such a procrastinator..  Anyways, I added a new tag board. Why? I don't know...  Edit: Two links added: Hikari and Ilyena. :)  Edited again: New links again: Keji and Icy Blaze.

      Tired... Want to go to sleep... Can barely keep my eyes open... Must stay awake... x_x I'm sleepy, but I can't fall asleep now because if I do, and then my dad wakes me up when he comes home (yeah, I'm home alone), I'd never be able to go back to sleep again..-_- Basically, I have to keep myself awake. Yeah..  Yesterday, I was at the States with my parents. My parents bought some stuff in some stores, I bought books in Borders:  Airframe  by Michael Crichton, and Dilbert comic books. Dilbert is the coolest comic ever!! :D I bought a three book in one volume thing for $5.99 US, it was on sale. Hehee ^__^.Dilbert is soo cool! I will go read them now. :)  * Here is the  Site of the Day :  urlLink Dibert's Offical Website . Enjoy!

      After an almost-four-hour drive, I'm  finally in Toronto. Ride was boring, fell asleep.... yah.. We visited the friend who is moving to Saskatoon (yes, correction. NOT Alberta, Saskatoon). I just sat there while my parents and them talked.. wooo, fun.. -_-  Well, I am going to Chinatown soon. That's good. I haven't been there for so long now. I don't know if that's a good thing... I don't know a lot of things, do I...? I wanna go to Chapters again... Books, lots of books. Lots of good books. ^_^ I am tired... *yawns*  Okay, I must go. Bid you all a happy farewell.  P.S. I use "..." a lot.... See? There it goes again... And again... and again... Okay, I'll stop.... Oops... again!!!! There. It ended. Hee... >_

      Boredom bites. A lot. And it's bad...-_- I have nothing to do. Well, I  can  start memorize The Star Spangled Banner, and O Canada, but I have the rest of the week to do that, so why bother with it now? Hee, procrastination wins again.. x_x  I'm going to Toronto tomorrow. Partly because my family haven't been to Toronto for quite a while now, must do some Chinatown shopping :D ! Also, my parents' friends (who lives in Toronto) are moving to Alberta soon, so we are visiting them, since we might not be able to see them for a really long time. I am glad we are going, 'cuz then I don't have to stay home and be bored...  I have to stress again how bored I am. iamborediamborediamverybored.. And I also miss... people.... yah, heh....

      Geo exam was alright. It was quite easy, but a little long... I  would  say that I studied a lot of useless stuff, but since I didn’t really study, I can’t say that... -__-  Me did a very bad thing today. I was suppose to meet Hikari and MB at the school’s front rotunda at 12:30 to study together, but I overslept at noon, so I ended up getting to school at 1:30... One hour late…>_  I will go play Survival Project now. It’s an online real time game thingy. Pretty cool. Will update later!   Song of the day : My Happy Ending -  Avril Lavigne .

      Wow... the science exam has left me speechless... I spent a long time studying things that turned out NOT to be on the exam. My precious time was wasted on studying useless stuff....>_  On to the next subject! Geography... Good thing about geography is that most of the stuff is still fresh in my mind, 'cuz I have semestered geo. I should be studying now, but I'm not. Why you ask? Because I am a lazy lazy bum, that's why.. >_> Procrastination is my downfall.  Maybe I should go review geo... and then it will turn out that I memorized all the useless stuff again, and then I will shoot myself because life is not fair... okay, enough rants for now....

      Today was my French exam, it was alright, beside the sight passage and the personal questions part. I missed one antonym and two synonyms… my French vocabulary really sucks...:( Anyways, science exam tomorrow, the only that I am really really really worried about...=/ I must go study more science… *sigh*   I have a sudden impulse of typing out lyrics, so here’s the  Lyric of the Day :   The stars will cry the blackest tears tonight  And this is the moment that I live for  I can smell the ocean air  Here I am pouring my heart onto these rooftops  Just a ghost to the world  Thats exactly,  Exactly what I need...   From up here the city lights burn Like a thousand miles of fire And I'm here to sing this anthem of our dying day...    From  Anthem of Our Dying Day , by  Story of the Year .

      Wooo, never updated this late before.. (I do get amused easily, don’t I?)  Today we had a parade in Brown City, which is somewhere in Michigan, United States. We all arrived at the Band Centre at 10:00 a.m., because we were supposed to, and left half an hour later when everybody was there and was in the Spirit of Windsor t-shirt. We had to bring our uniforms and instruments with us on the bus, and will change there. Supposedly, the bus ride should be 1 hour, but from leaving the Band Centre to arriving at the parade, it took almost 2 and half hours. We had to change on the bus because we were going to be late. It was quite amusing… Guys just went straight ahead and put on their uniforms, while a lot of girls hesitated, but they still had to change anyways. Me, on the other hand, had shorts under my pants, so I changed without any second thoughts.. Haha. It’s good to be prepared… :P  Anyways, the parade itself was, um, bad… Our backbone marchers wasn’t there today, so we kind of fell apart sometimes. The band was really weak, heh…..>_  Enough of the parade, today is a very nice day. Bright and shiny, with occasionally breezes. Woooooooo *imitates the wind blowing* (no, I am not insane, I’m just a little hyper right now). Wow, so hyper… lalalallaallalala~~~ Okay, me stop now....  Almost ten = almost bed time.... I shall blog later!  Edit to say: I just looked at the title of the entry. Why did they name it Brown City, that's so stupid! It's not even brown!

      Right... so this is the pre-exams period (even though I already had two of my exams already -_-, but they are not during the  official  exam week, so I guess it doesn't really count), the fateful time that decides whether you shall proceed to the next level of education or not. This is when I start to freak out because my incredibly lazy self does not want to study, so I procrastinate, and procrastinate, and procrastinate until I realize how screwed I because I didn't study for any of my exams at all. Great, eh? ¬_¬...  Anyways, I have two exams tomorrow: Band and English. Band exam shouldn't be difficult, so I'm not that worried about that. And English, well, you can't really study for that, can you...? So I'm good for today. There won't be any last-minute-late-night cramming tonight, which is good :). Hmm, next week, four exams (in order): French, Science, Geography, and Business. W00t! No math exam! Me got exempted! Hehee. Not that I don't like math or anything, I love math. It's just one less thing to study for. I sound so pathetic... -_-  Maybe I should start studying right now? I dunno, I'm such a lazy bum.. >_  Dinner time........................

      Sorry for the lack of update in the past few days. Two reasons: 1) Studying for exams, since they are starting tomorrow. 2) Laziness....  Yeah.. this is just to let people know that I'm not dead. Later~.

      Yah! Today was the Strawberry Festival Parade. Since I'm in Spirit of Windsor Marching Band, I had to march for the Parade. This would be my third time marching. The former two were the Tecumseh Winter Parade, and the Windsor Santa Clause Parade in the winter.  We were supposed to be at the band centre at 8a.m., to get into our uniforms and practice the moves and stuff, and left for LaSalle around 9. We drove pass the Optimists on our way there, pshh they're our rival band. They suck. Haha. Anyways, the parade started at 10, we were the second or third group to go. Before us were a flow cart thingy, and some dudes riding on bicycles doing tricks. It wasn't a long parade, was only about 30 or 40mins, but it was not that comfortable for me. Mike (drumline director) told me to tuck my hair in my helmet, which was... difficult to do, because for those who know me, my hair is quite long -_-... So basically, I had twist it into a bun,  without  the pins to keep it up, and wore my helmet over. So umm, it was a bit tight on the forehead, and it hurted, and I had to bear with it through the whole parade, and I couldn't adjust the strap because then I would not be in attention... grrr, -_-   Since I am guilty of not memorizing  all  of the marching music (stress on ALL, because I DO have most of them in my head), I sorta... "BSed" my way through parts of it.. heh.. Now I must memorize all of the music..   Moving on, after wer marched through the parade, we were at the bus eating, and drinking, and fooling around. It was fun, besides the part when Demitri came behind me and choked me ¬_¬. We got back to the band centre, and everyone left. We all had a good time. :D  * I also must mention that Hikari and I are psychically connected, like those weird twin thingies. Yesterday, we both came to school complaining that ew slept late last night, and have this big headache, and burning eyes, and could practically fall asleep during geo class. And then at science, our eyes weren't teary anymore, instead they were dry. And by the end of school we were perfectly good again! It was so cool, we are so twins :D. Go bomb demons and our avatars!  -Nariel  Whoa, I typed a lot...

      The reason why I didn't update yesterday was because of the end-of-the-year concert. It ran from 7p.m. to 10:15p.m., so by the time I got home, it was already 10:30. The concert was great. Jazz Band went first, then Concert Band (which I am in), and then Wind Ensemble. After the bands' performances, there was the awards presentation, and a New York Band Trip slide show. The slide show looked so fun, it almost made me feel sad that I didn't go on the trip.  ALMOST . Pshh, won't trade SOMA experience for anything in the world, for it  is  the greatest!  Anyways, back to the concert. Jazz band was good, can't remember too much about it, heh. Concert Band performed well last night. I was so afraid that we are going to screw up like we did on Monday's rehearsal, but we didn't. Instead, we were great :D! The only thing I didn't like about Wind Ensemble was because the songs were too long. They were great music, but just too long...-_-  The awards presentation was short, go Noogie for winning the Most Improved Student, pshh *pokes him* ^__^! Anyways, as I said before, the NYC slide show looked tempting, but SOMA RULES! Hahahaa...  Must go to study for the science test, I would be so screwed if I don't study for this one.. *crys*  -Nariel  Oh yeah, on a sidenote, SOMA = Southern Ontario Model United Nations Assembly. It PWNS all.

      Wooo, I just practiced my flute for 45 minutes straight, I can faint now.. =/ It seems I have a few music events coming up. School concert is tomorrow at 7p.m., after that, there would be no more concert band rehearsals, which means I don't have to get up at 6a.m. in the morning anymore ^__^, at least until when band starts again next year. Also, the parade for Strawberry Festival is on Saturday, which means I have to practice some more, and have to review the moves for Malaguena.. joy.  Anyways, today in science class, we watched the second half of the Miracle of Life video, I am scarred for life now, it was very... disturbing. >_> I was lucky enough to miss the first part of the video yesterday, since I went to help Gauss, pshhh.  Oh, and I did horribly on the EQAO, because those stupid questions don't make any sense at all..-__-

      Umm, I'm leaving to the States this afternoon. My flight is tomorrow at 2pm. Kinda nervous, the pre-flight syndrome, when I worry about things such as: what if the plane crashes... eh.. x_x  Well.. I won't have unlimited internet access in China, last time I went back the phone bill was sky high because I was constently chatting and stuff... heh... Well, must go..  * Currently feels  very empty .

      It's been a loong time since I last blogged. So lazy.. yeah.   Not much happened over the last few days. Had a parade on July 3rd in Northville, MI. Good parade, but it was unbearably hot. Yeah. Pshhh.  Well, today I went to school and got my not-so-good report card. Badness. Three of my marks sucks. Well, one of them is okay because it's Phys. Ed., so that doesn't matter. So I guess only two of my marks suck? I did bad.. yeah... Next year, I'll actually try harder, if me and Hikari doesn't mess up again -_-. Yeah... So that might pull my grades up a little bit.  I'm going to China on July 10th, YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Will go back to see my grandparents and all that. Coming back on September 1st. which means I will be here for registering day, and my birthday too. Started packing yesterday. Boring...   Link of the Day : urlLink P u r e n e s s - Hikari's Blog .
