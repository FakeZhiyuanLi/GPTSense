      am i wrong or does everybody else on the planet except for me hate this country?  maybe it's because i have been to other countries and i've seen how they live.  i love it here.  there is no place i'd rather be.  i can sleep where i want, reside where i want, work where i want, learn what i want, eat what i want, say what i want, do what i want, watch what i want, write, read, live, be what i want.  there is no other country in the world where this is possible (even in france and great britain these liberties are not as freely accessible as they are here).  i believe that God prepared this land from when he first organized it to be special and choice above all others.  He has told us this is true.  we are blessed to be here and should be grateful.    i know that there are many people who do not share my thoughts about this country.  they feel that the land that allowed them to be who they choose to be is also inherently evil.  they believe we have no right to make the world a better, safer place.  what is better or safer you ask?  i respond, a place where i am not afraid to be what i want to be.  there are evil people in the world and we will not be safe until they are removed from positions of power.  yes, it is my place to judge evil from righteousness.  yes, i am my brother's keeper.  yes, i have every right to tell you that what you are doing is wrong.  does the news report any thing good that the united states does?  madonna thinks saddam hussein and pres. bush are identical in political pursuits.  that was a big story for some reason.  i don't think that president bush cares about what madonna thinks of him, i know i don't.  michael moore doesn't like president bush.  surprisingly,  michael moore doesn't like any republicans, and i venture to say that it's just because they are republicans.  i wish people took responsibility for themselves and stopped blaming others for what happens to them.  It is not mcdonalds fault that you're fat.  it is not phillip/morris' fault that you have lung cancer.  it is not smith and wesson's fault that you were killed by a handgun.  it is not coor's fault that you are an alcoholic.  every person has agency and every decision that person makes affects him and others.  we are only responsible for our own actions and those alone.  but we must help others to make the right decision.   it is the responibility of the strong to protect the weak.

      This is the first time that I have communicated in this type of medium.  I don't know if anybody will see this but I think that some may like to read my thoughts today.  I am an elder of the Church Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  I write this first about myself because I feel that this information will help people who read my thoughts understand my feelings and perspective.  I served a full-time mission from march of 1998 to April of 2000 in the Scotland Edinburgh mission.  I served under President Norman Clyde.  My mission experiences have helped, more than any others, to shape me into the person I am today.  I loved my time in the mission field and if called upon again today, I would go.  I am married now to the best woman I have ever known and we have one child, a daughter.  We just celebrated my daughter's second birthday.  I love my little girl very much,  and I thank my Father in heaven for the blessing of her presence in my life every day.  I sometimes think about what I would do if I ever lost one of my girls.  I think I can honestly say that I don't know what I would do and I hope to never have to find out.  They both mean the world to me and living without either one of them would be extremely hard. I hope to never face that test.  Tomorrow is Father's day and we plan on spending the day with my parents.  We should be at church but it's sometimes a trade I reluctantly have to make to spend time with my parents.  My mother is an inactive member of the church and my father is not a member at all.  They do not share all of my convictions but they respect them and that is good enough for me.  I spend a lot of my free time playing Xbox.  We don't have much expendable income so we are at home much of the time and this is how I like to use it.  I try not to do this at the expense of neglecting my family but my wife recently felt that I was wasting too much time in this regard and decided to liberate me from the burden of video game playing by giving away my collection to a "neighbor".  I was eventually successful in persuading her to get them back and now I try to make a more conscientious effort to be understanding of her desire to be together as a family.  This and I don't want to be hit anymore.  (I hope she never reads this, I'll be in big trouble.)  I am also finding it harder to justify my playing mature rated games with a small child in the house.  I really don't play any gratuitously violent or sexual games but I don't want her to come to me one day and ask me why the Master Chief has to kill so many aliens in order to make his point.  I guess I could reason with her that it's because they are trying to kill him but I'd rather avoid the whole situation altogether.  I think I'll just see what happens; cross that bridge when I come to it so-to-speak.  I just traded in a few games and purchased Thief: Deadly Shadows.  So far it's a pretty solid game.  I find myself torn between how to accomplish my goals.  It is difficult not to just go around killing everybody with my dagger or bow instead of only knocking them out with the blackjack.  Just killing them is much easier but it feels like I am skewing my moral compass at every stab.  But it is much more fun.   (do my statements seem ironic or hypocritical to anyone else?  Just a paragraph ago I was eschewing my burgeoning video game morality and now I say killing npc's is fun.  I'm going to hell for sure.)  I find these ironic twists to be a large part of my personality or maybe even my being as a whole.  I know what is right and I strive be good, but sometimes, every now and then, I get a little....How shall we say it.....mischievous.  My wife constantly reminds me to be better or try harder.  She's right.  I do need to be better.  Being mischievous will not help me get to heaven.  But it is more fun.
