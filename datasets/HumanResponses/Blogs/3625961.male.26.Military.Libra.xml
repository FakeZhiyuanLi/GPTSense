						   [From Tuesday, January 13, 2004] The Cartesian Theater model of the mind is false; there is no little observer manipulating things from the control room of consciousness. Perhaps the Multiple Drafts model is the way to go, or perhaps there’s another way, but the point is that consciousness is not tied to a ‘singularity’. So what is consciousness? [Daniel] Dennett’s best guess, and mine as well, is that it is a set of relations in the brain. These relations change from moment to moment, and yet each ‘person’ maintains a contiguous sense of ‘self’. So where is the ‘I’ located? Is each set of mental relations a unique individual? What happens when you spontaneously substitute one instant of relations for another, maybe even of a different set, in the stream of conscious narrative? Would ‘you’ know something was wrong or out of sorts? Does this whole line of thought even make any sense? The ‘I’ is not any particular snapshot of the state of the brain. The ‘I’ is the whole class of relations or states that can be instantiated in the brain. Imagine the set of all possible mental states. This set is infinite if an infinitely sized brain is allowed, and it includes the mental states of minds that are disabled or cognitively deficient and the mental states of many animals (it might even contain the ‘mental’ state of organizations of things, like an ant colony or a corporation). Let’s limit the set to all mental states of ‘human’ capacity. This smaller set, although limited to ‘human’ capacity, may contain states that are instantiated outside of a ‘human’ brain. What if we limit the set further to the set of all of ‘my’ mental states, every one from birth to death. This set is the life ‘I’ am living and will continue to live. What happens to ‘me’ if the set is tweaked just a little? Is the set still ‘me’ or would it be ‘someone else’? The conscious narrative would be slightly different, but the experiences would be the same, and the events would be the same. Perhaps the slight difference in conscious narrative is enough to distinguish between two ‘individuals’, but to all outside observers it would be the same person. So this begs the question: if there is no empirical way to distinguish between two slightly different conscious narratives, are they really two different ‘individuals’? Perhaps our idea of an ‘individual’ is wrong? Perhaps our idea of ‘self’ or ‘I’ is wrong? All conscious narratives differ by many of these ‘slight’ changes, so what if these narratives are not each unique ‘selves’ but are instead part of a class of ‘self’? The class of conscious narratives is ‘self’. ‘I’ is the class of conscious narratives. ‘I’ am the class of conscious narratives. Repeat that sentence to ‘yourself’. So what now is the meaning of life?  [The following is from today.] Let's take an example. Let's say Bob is a perfectly normal person. His conscious narative has been consistent from birth to the present day. Now let's say Bob gets into an accident and suffers brain damage, but doesn't die. All of a sudden, Bob seems like a completely different person. Maybe he can't remember everything that's happened to him in his life. Maybe he's lost the capacity to understand things the way he used to. It doesn't really matter how he's different, what matters is the fact that he is different. He is effectively a different person; the course of his conscious narrative has been utterly changed. But this change wasn't gradual, it was immediate. This creates a problem for me. Discontinuities work fine in mathematics, but they don't jive in the real world of 'cause and effect'. So what am I forced to admit? That even though the conscious narrative is entirely different, it must still be the same 'person'. What are the implications of this admission? If two different conscious narratives are said to be the same person, then it follows that any two conscious narratives are the same person (whether they are aware of it or not). What this really means is that all conscious narratives belong to the same class of relations; they are all part of one big class called consciousness. Imagine if your mind encompassed the entire universe, let's say it was the universe, you would experience every single conscious narrative that has ever been experienced or ever will be experienced, and yet you would perceive it as one experience; you would experience everything that every possible person experiences, but it would be as if you were only one person. That's what I mean by "'I' am the class of conscious narratives". We are all 'special', in a sense, by being part of that single, grand, conscious narrative.

						   [From Saturday, January 10, 2004] Drugs are bad, m’kay. We all know this, and still people use illegal drugs. People know McDonald’s food is bad, and yet they still eat there. People know that sitting on your butt and watching TV 24/7 is bad, but people still do it. You can’t stop people from making bad choices. All you can do is educate them and hope that they make the right choices on their own. Using certain illegal drugs is not only physically addictive and mind altering, it also comes with a heavy penalty if caught. But people still use them. So how do we get rid of the problem? We can’t, it’s impossible. People can get a mind altering high off of just about anything. All we can control is their education. What is the benefit of the war on drugs? Drug use of illegal drugs is down, but drug use of legal drugs is up. Are there any other benefits? Hmm … nope. On the other hand, the war on drugs costs billions and billions of dollars a year, creates criminals out of and fills up our prisons with otherwise non-violent people, creates a lucrative black-market for gangs and dealers and rogue states, and basically leads to the funding of terrorists. And we’re willing to pay all of that for a marginal decrease in illegal drug use? Frankly, we have some stupid people in America clinging to some stupid ideals; and this is the country that supposedly values ‘freedom’ so much. Whatever happened to personal responsibility?  [The following is from today.] I don't even care about drugs, honestly. I don't use legal or illegal drugs as a rule. What I care about are the principles of logic and reason. Just look at the debut of the recent film by Michael Moore, "Fahrenheit 9/11": lots of people were opposed to it and tried to keep it from getting distributed or advertised. What was the result? It made people curious what all of the fuss was about, and now people are flocking to that film in droves. It's the same with anything in our society. We tell kids, "don't watch that movie", "don't say those words", "don't drink or smoke", and what do kids do? They watch that movie, they say those words, they drink and smoke. Look, if you want to keep people from doing something that you clearly think is wrong, the best way to attack them is with logic and reason. Not everyone shares the same faith or (institutionalized) value system, but everyone is beholden to logic and reason. And if logic and reason aren't good enough, then their own personal experience is the only thing that will convince them. So let them make their mistakes, let them take their lumps, and let them change their minds in their own time. For Heaven's, Glorb's, and Purple Elefant's with Pink Wings sake!  Don't force them to live a lifestyle they don't understand by making certain life-choices illegal! I mean, Holy Jebus, and Flying Fricker-snacks, people! Can you just let others live the way they want to?

						   [From Saturday, January 10, 2004] Non-profits exist for the needy (presumably), and so if you give your money to an NPO, you intend for it to help the needy, which is a worthy goal. Now, should there be an incentive for people to help the needy? Sure, why not, as long as it’s not an enormous incentive, because then people would be giving their money specifically for the incentive rather than to help the needy. So we give people who donate their money tax breaks; that’s fine by me. NPOs take the money, help the needy, pay their personnel, and put the rest of the money back into the NPO (just like a corporation, I might add). None of this money handling is taxed on the NPO side of things. None of the assets of the NPO are taxed. There is no disincentive for creating an NPO, and there are minor incentives for helping the needy, so consequently, there are a tremendous number of NPOs out there. How many of these NPOs actually do any good? I don’t know, but since there are no disincentives, I would imagine that most NPOs don’t actually do any good. If there were minor disincentives, then most of the NPOs that don’t benefit anyone would fold. Personally, since I’m an efficiency freak, I would like a system that would eliminate inefficient and non-beneficial NPOs, and strengthen the other ones through competition. But a more immediate worry of mine is the accrual of non-taxable assets by NPOs, specifically land. If assets aren’t taxed, there’s no way to put them back into the public pool; NPOs can hold their assets indefinitely without doing a lick of work and without getting any additional funding. This to me is a broken system.  [The following is from today.] This excerpt is from  Thompson and Thompson : "An organization does not need exempt status to avoid paying income taxes on contribution receipts, as some mistakenly believe. Income taxes are imposed only on income and not on other forms of revenue. For example, income taxes are not imposed on gifts because gifts are not income. Since a nonprofit organization's contribution receipts are gifts, they are not income. Therefore, donations are not subject to the income tax."  "There are additional reasons why nonprofit organizations seek recognition of their exempt status. These include property tax and sales tax exemptions in some states. Exempt status also helps to qualify an organization for low postal rates, favorable pension plan status, tax sheltered annuity plans, and in some cases, exemption from state and federal employment discrimination laws. In many cases, exempt status is tied to eligibility for government funding, contracts, licensing or accreditation."  "In a nonprofit organization, the people most likely to derive any prohibited personal benefit are its directors and officers, and in some cases key employees. Profits realized by an organization can be paid to these insiders by several means. These include excessive (unreasonable) wages, large bonuses, free or discounted use of corporate assets for personal use (such as cars and condominiums) and lavish business expense accounts."   "The PTL Club case (a religious television ministry) presents a classic example of private inurement (personal profits) paid to insiders. According to the IRS recommendation to revoke PTL's exempt status dated November 13, 1985, $1,469,871.15 was improperly paid to Jim and Tammy Bakker from 1981 through 1983. About one third of this amount was excessive compensation paid to Jim Bakker. Almost half consisted of assets purchased for the personal use of the Bakker family. The rest resulted from expenses incurred for the Bakkers' benefit which served no exempt purpose, the use of PTL funds interest free, and excessive bonuses paid to Tammy Bakker."   Perhaps we're already cracking down on gross abusers of the system, but we wouldn't even need to if we just taxed property. After all, people need a place to put all of their expensive cars, jewelry, furniture, etc.

						   [From Saturday, January 10, 2004] [My friend] Powell is talking about artificial intelligence, his favorite topic. He’s writing a ‘pamphlet’ about why artificial intelligence should not be feared. It’s a persuasive paper that will eventually be fleshed out into a book.   First of all, is artificial intelligence possible? To me, the answer is obviously yes. From a materialist perspective, since humans exist, strong AI is possible. The strongest arguments against the possibility of a strong AI are based on the notion of some special property of experience intrinsic to human consciousness, such as emotion or pain, that simply can’t be mechanized or have a materialistic explanation. Many people seem to believe that the experiencing of emotion or pain is not merely mechanical, but that it requires a special property of being an agent such as a soul or some other kind of Cartesian Theater locus. People are very attached to the ‘unity’ and ‘linearity’ of their conscious experience, so much so that they aren’t aware of the logical contradictions that arise from a Cartesian Theater model of the mind. Many other publications have covered this topic, and while there is still disagreement, the question of whether AI is possible has been sufficiently laid to rest. Conclusion? It is possible.  Now for the tough questions: is AI desirable? What will happen to ‘us’ if and when AI is created? If AI is possible, does that mean that we’re all just machines? What’s the point of life if we’re just machines? Do machines go to heaven? What’s at stake on the outcome of these questions? Ambition. Motivation. Values. God. Truth. Obviously, if people have a lot invested (say their entire justification for all things) in a particular outcome of one of these questions, then they will not see the case for the other side no matter how much evidence or logic there is in support of it. They have ‘faith’ that their beliefs are correct, and in fact they believe that ‘faith’ is central to their most important beliefs. Seems very circular, doesn’t it? But [the circularity] is not really the problem, is it? Any explanation will have at its foundation a circularity. No, the main problem is [faith, or] the ‘faith in faithfulness’. Faith is the kind of thing one takes for granted, by definition (that’s a fine sentence, isn’t it?). What I’m getting at is the defeat of faith: faith must be examined, thereby defeating it.  [The following thoughts are from today.] A person of strong faith might declare that it is impossible for anyone to operate without faith, that at the most basic level everyone has faith in their beliefs being true. For instance, everyone has faith that Earth's gravity will keep them on the ground. Is it possible to know without doubt that this is true? No, for every line of reasoning depends on axioms which are merely held to be true, and all past experience is no gaurantee of future experience. So is it true then that everything boils down to faith? No, otherwise belief and faith would be wholy synonymous, thereby doing damage to one term or the other. It is true that belief encompasses faith, but faith does not encompass belief; faith is a subset of belief. If we are to distinguish between belief and faith, we must make faith more specific, limiting its scope. When I use the word faith, I mean a belief that is un-questioned; people who have faith trust that their belief is true without further inquiry. Most of the things people believe are questioned, which means that people don't have a whole lot of faith by my definition. What sorts of belief are un-questioned? That's something each person must answer for themselves. I, for one, question everything, and so I have no faith.  How is all of this related to artificial intelligence? Quite simply, in order to approach the idea of artificial intelligence and what its implications are for our place in the universe, faith must be questioned on many levels. Until that happens, no useful and intelligent discussion may take place. The 'tough' questions I mentioned earlier become irrelevant once faith is properly questioned.

						   As much as I dislike Bush, it's time for Kerry to get his due. I've given Kerry the benefit of the doubt up to this point hoping he would do or say something that would inspire me and give me hope, but after the DNC, I felt incredibly underwhelmed.  As usual, Edwards was the shining point. I don't agree with a lot of Edwards' socialist ideals, but his sentiment seems genuine to me. I truly believe he would work his butt off for this country as president. But more importantly, Edwards is very persuasive and eloquent; he would be extremely valuable in foreign affairs, which is the most important job for&nbsp;a president.  This post isn't about Edwards, however, it's about Kerry. Kerry, The War Hero! Whoever decided that this should be the focus of Kerry's campaign has seriously miscalculated (maybe they just wanted an easy paycheck and didn't want to work). I almost feel like voting for Bush just because I'm sick and tired of this irrelevant rhetoric. Kerry, no one cares that you served your country in Vietnam! If they did, they probably don't anymore because they're just as sick as I am of hearing about it. People respect humility and *selfless* service, not self-grandizing bull shit.  It should be fairly obvious by now that the only reason anyone's going to vote for Kerry is because they really hate Bush (including me). It would be nearly impossible for Kerry to lose my vote at this point because of the alternative, but he's sure giving his best shot. As far as I can tell, Kerry doesn't stand for much except winning. All his words, his entire campaign is structured around offending the least number of people. He doesn't want to explain his ideas, or support his claims, because that might lose votes.   Kerry, everything that comes out of your mouth is scripted, uninspired, contrived rhetoric. You just spout off a bunch of nonsense because you think it's going to win you some votes. Well, it's not, big guy. You promise to cut taxes for the middle class, increase the size of the military, provide universal health coverage including cheap drugs, maintain social security, while decreasing the deficit at the same time?!? Boy, you've covered just about all of the bases there. How could anyone *not* vote for that! Either Kerry believes this and is an idiot, or he is merely deceiving the public hoping it will get him votes. Either way, that's not very encouraging.  It pisses me off he's going to become President of the Frickin USA using this tactic, but what choice have the Republicans left us? They have clearly lost their minds putting all of their faith in Bush. It's sad that the only figure on either side that gives me hope is Edwards, and he's a frickin looney-toons socialist! I would vote for Edwards in an instant, though, because a socialist president can't really do any damage with a capitalist congress running the show.

						   People are special. More than merely intelligent, people are able to form strong and varied social bonds with one another for the benefit of society and the species as a whole. People have the capacity to see things as Good and Evil, which is complimented by a depth of emotion and feeling that has no equal in the rest of the animal kingdom. People have the ability to know things beyond their senses and perceptions, to explore the infinitude of 'what if', to reconstuct the past and predict the future in a limited scope. This penchant for understanding 'causes and effects' allows people to solve immediate and forthcoming problems using a variety of different methods and approaches, which in effect gives people&nbsp;a strong sense of free will.&nbsp;But most remarkable of all&nbsp;are the imagination and creativity of people, producing beauty of thought and expression in all aspects of life. This is why people are proud to be human, and why their vainity obscures and dominates their humility. This is the true value of a person.   But what specifically is the source of all of these aspects of humanity that&nbsp;people value? The body as a whole is a great tool and instrument for manifesting these aspects, but people have surpassed their raw physical abilities through technology, to the point where the body is now considered to be physically limiting. The body is still wonderfully useful, but not truly what people&nbsp;care about when appreciating another person (except in the areas of aesthetics and physical competition).   Ignoring personal arbitrary bias', what people care about are personalities: what people believe, what values they hold, and what choices they make. Personalities are influenced by the body to some extent, but they are more tightly influenced by other personalities. All personalities interface and communicate with the world through minds (and souls, if you want to add unnecessary widgets that don't have any additional explanitory power). In fact, personalities can't exist without minds, though they can exist with severe physical handicaps and limitations. It is our specifically human personalities that we value, not our specifically human bodies based on our specifically human genetics.   So, if we value someone at all, it is because of these human characteristics as manifested through their personalities. If an entity was not genetically human, but it still had the personality traits that we care about in humans, shouldn't we still value that entity as we value a human? Shouldn't we value that entity as 'human'? Suppose we were able to create, through breeding or engineering, a species of dog that had human intelligence. Wouldn't we be morally obligated to&nbsp;give them the same consideration and respect that we normally&nbsp;only hold for ourselves?&nbsp;This is the point where the 'soul' widget finds a use, in asserting the uniqueness of Humanity,&nbsp;so that&nbsp;even if an entity were to match the most important aspects of Humanity, it still would be deemed inferior.&nbsp;  What if we took a small society of humans and started to selectively breed them for traits that were more canine, including personality? Let's say we did that over millions of years. These humans, at that point, would most likely resemble dogs and behave like dogs, but would they still be privileged with a soul? At what point during this genetic transformation would they lose their soul, if they were to lose it at all?  For a less time-consuming and more plausible example, let's say we took a human embryo and removed a chromosome, and did it in such a way so that the embryo would survive and be carried to term. That's a pretty drastic change in genetics, but it still came initially from the product of a man and a woman, and we didn't kill the lifeform, so if it ever had a soul, presumably it would still have one. If we continued to breed the new species with a soul, we could use the same trick to create another genetically regressive species with a soul. What if we used that trick all the way down to a single celled organism? Then all&nbsp;sorts of new creatures of the world&nbsp;would be descended from Adam and Eve, and have souls.  One could make the argument, I suppose, that&nbsp;the original embryo&nbsp;had a soul, but then it was forcibly removed by changing the genetics. This would be, in effect, murder, with the soul probably going off to heaven because of its pure innocence, even though no physical death was involved. So the embryo, though technically alive, would now be souless. But what if we have a change of heart and put the chromosome that we took away back? Behold, a miracle! The embryo has a soul again!  Clearly, it is futile to try to determine the conditions for soulhood, for there are too many variables to take into account, too many ways in which the genome of a soul-bearing human can be cleaved; I've only&nbsp;begun to stimulate the&nbsp;extremeties&nbsp;in this exercise of spiritual masturbation.&nbsp;It would be difficult and ultimately immoral to base appreciation of an entity on soulhood. Personality is something that can be measured much more easily, and is a better indicator of what we truly want anyway.  If personality is our litmus test for humanity, then what do we say about the human embryo, or fetus, baby, or toddler? Are these early stages of human life somehow less 'human' than the adult stages? That is the implication, and that is the stance that must be adopted if personality is to be valued above all. If we consider only personality when determining whether an entity qualifies as a human, then it is quite obvious that a genetically human embryo is not a human in any of the senses that we care about; it has no personality, and thus has no value except in potential. Consider another genetically human entity that has no value or potential, my finger. I could chop off my finger and it would not change my personality appreciably. The value of me as a person does not lie in my finger. In the case of an embryo, there is no person to value.  Does an embryo have a soul? Does my finger have a soul? Where does the soul reside if not in the mind? The embryo is not a person, literally or figuratively. If a soul is claimed to reside there, then it must be claimed to reside everywhere. Abortion at this stage of the game is not murder; it's not even immoral. When the fetus develops a nervous system, that's when the line&nbsp;between person and non-person starts to get fuzzy.

						   I fully admit it. My atheistic bent has limited my capacity for seeing good in the world, and my materialism is worthless without some modicum of faith that everything will work out according to a higher plan. America is by far the greatest country in the world, and the person who leads it was elected by the greatest people in the world. He has been and will continue to be guided by divine providence. He has set an example for all future leaders to follow, punishing the wicked, liberating the oppressed, and bringing justice and democracy to the poor wretches who need it most. The world will be glorious in the days to come, with other countries following our lead, and uniting to abolish tyrrany in all its forms throughout the world. Soon North Korea will fall, and their people will no longer go hungry. China will transform from within, with our encouragement, becoming a bountiful capitalist society, and conquering its hidden social demons. Iran is already on a path to enlightenment, and through subtle coaxing we will be able to help their fledgling popular theocracy bloom, establishing a new paradigm and world order for how society and government should be run. Afghanistan and Iraq, previously the two most troubled nations, are now two of the brightess nations with endless potential. They will be a beacon for&nbsp;Middle-Easterners everywhere,&nbsp;demonstrating the joys and benefits of democracy and freedom. It will truely be a marvelous world! Except for those damn secular socialists in Europe, but we will *deal* with them later.  God bless us, everyone (except those vile sinning homos)!

						   If souls do exist in a Judeo-Christian sense, do they have a gender? Christians like to say that "all men are created equal". This could mean many things, though obviously it does not mean that all men (and women) are literally equal. It could mean that all people are physically human, or it could mean that all people have human minds and souls, or it could mean both. &nbsp; Are souls, then, equal, or is there some intrinsic difference between the souls of men and women? If there is no difference, that souls just happen to be attached to bodies with gender but don't actually have one themselves, then when two people bond spiritually, it is a genderless bond in the eyes of God. If this is the case, then homosexuals can be married in a spiritual sense. &nbsp; But what if there is a spiritual difference between the souls of men and women, what if souls do have gender, and only souls of opposite gender can join in spiritual marriage? This would seem to be a strong case against gay marriage except that there's no guarantee that the gender of someone's soul will match the gender of their body.  &nbsp; It is impossible for any of us to be sure that the gender of a person's soul matches the gender of their body. In fact, there are many fringe cases where a person is born with the reproductive organs of both genders, and other cases where a person has neither. Does this mean that their soul is similarly botched and confused? If we allow that the gender of a person's soul does not necessarily match the gender of their body, then physically homosexual people can be spiritually married in the eyes of God. &nbsp; The only perspective that would refute God's sactioning of gay marriage is the perspective of souls with gender matching precisely bodies with gender. If you happen to be one of the fringe cases, that's tough luck, life isn't fair (even though you're supposed to be as equal as others in the eyes of God).

						   I don't claim to know all of the reasons for gays wanting to get married, but it seems to me that the main purpose would be to have the state/federal government recognize their relationship as legally binding, and offer them the same legal benefits and conveniences of traditional&nbsp;married couples.&nbsp;Nathanael may be right about the nature of homosexuality and about the exclusively-hetero 'spiritual' aspect of marriage (that point is irrelevant to me since I don't believe in spirits), but the legal aspect of marriage has no basis in tradition and says nothing about the spiritual connection any couple might share.  &nbsp;  The fact is that *any* man and *any* woman can get legally married for whatever fanciful reason provided that it is to a member of the opposite sex. So in effect, the government is sort of subsidizing legally binding contracts between a single man and a single woman, but only in a very specific family-building way. The main benefits of marriage are focused on the issues of dependence, inheritence, adoption, health and life insurance, pension, loans and credit, etc.  &nbsp;  Most of the benefits only make sense in the context of a tight family structure. Why would Joe Blow, for instance, want to legally extend the benefits of his life and health insurance to Jane Doe? She would have to be one of the most important people in the world to him (or she would have to be extremely beautiful, and he extremely covetous and vain). As the law stands now, Joe Blow could propose to Jane Doe for shits and giggles, but Adam Twigs and John Berries can't share any benefits together (without tremendous work) even though they are the most important people in the world to each other. Maybe Adam and John want to adopt a baby girl from China and extend their benefits to her. Why wouldn't the government want to encourage or facilitate such a structure? Because they both have penises? Because homosexuality is a sin? Those aren't viable reasons (unless you're a *bigot*).  &nbsp;  The marriage contract is (supposedly) designed to encourage family structures. All too often people get married out of habit, or political correctness, or convenience, and not for the originally intended purpose of marriage. Many homosexuals want to get married for the right reasons, for the reasons marriage was designed. Why should we deny them that possibility? It's not going to keep them from being gay, and it's not going to keep others from becoming gay (supposing those were the goals).  &nbsp;  If you want to protect the spiritual nature of marriage, you need to take it out of the law books entirely. I understand that people want their God-sanctioned relationship recognized by the state, so why not create a separate legal contract that's not marriage, that can be enjoyed by both heterosexuals and homosexuals alike? This would preserve and possibly strengthen the "sanctity" of marriage, while at the same time legally encourage family structures for both kinds of people. It's a win-win scenario.

						   I'm not going to discuss every little policy or decision of the current administration, I'm just going to focus on some of the big ones on everyone's mind.  First, is America safer because of Bush's war on terrorism? To me, that's not quite the right question to ask. Whether America is actually safer or not is irrelevant because obviously something had to be done in the wake of 9/11. Inaction in that situation would have been unacceptable at best. In fact, I would wager my eternal, gorb-given piggy-bank that nearly anyone in that same position would have taken some sort of military action. Did anyone in America, from either party, or anyone around the free world for that matter, disagree with invading Afghanistan? The Gallup poll from November, 2001 showed that 80% of Americans supported the war. That's not just a majority, that's an overwhelming majority. Shall we give credit, then, to Bush for waging a war that 4 out of 5 Americans would have waged? No, we must first look at *how* that war was waged, and how, without retrospect, others might have waged it.  The first mistake was not giving direct orders to get Bin Laden dead or alive. You see, by the Geneva conventions, political leaders cannot be assassinated, and when one of our snipers had Bin Laden in his sights, he did not receive the go-ahead from his commander because of the fuzzy legal implications. It should have been quite obvious that the Geneva conventions don't apply to Bin Laden in that regard, and the order should have been given by the president to remove all doubt. The next biggest mistake was supporting certain warlords in our attempts to bring down the Taliban regime. Some of these warlords are just as bad if not worse than the Taliban itself. The last great and ongoing mistake was not finishing all of the work that needed to be done stabilizing the country. Currently, the government headed by President Karzai is in control of only the capital in Kabul and some of the surrounding areas. And for all of our hard work to bring the Al-Qaida leadership to justice, we still haven't been able to find the one man who is most responsible for the atrocities of 9/11, Osama Bin Laden. So I say again, nearly anyone would have invaded Afghanistan, but how many people would have stayed to finish the job and capture Bin Laden?  Perhaps Bush would have stayed focused in Afghanistan if it weren't for his next biggest mistake: invading Iraq. I should qualify that, because it seems likely that we were eventually going to invade Iraq anyway. In this sense, invading Iraq was less a mistake and more an inevitability, but again, we should not fall prey to crediting a man for doing the obvious if he does it poorly. If we had not invaded Iraq when we did, we would have done so the following year, or the year after that, or within five years or ten. Really, it comes down to a matter of timing. Some might claim that if we were going to do it eventually, why not do it right away, but timing is about as important as the action itself.   Several factors conspired to make the impatient and hasty decision to invade Iraq a disaster, especially for the American people. First of all, there was no unified coalition of support for a war, let alone a pre-emptive one, against Iraq. This resulted in placing nearly the entire financial, military, and political burden on the shoulders of the common hard-working, Gorb-fearing American. Second, the war in Afghanistan was already a hefty financial, military, and political burden even considering the world-wide support for it. And while the instantaneous strength of the American military is unparalleled in the history of the world, it is only good for major combat and not urban warfare. It is a sore abuse of our *volunteer* military to send them back to war (let alone a pre-emptive war) before they've even had time to recover from the previous one. Adding insult to injury, we make them stay in a hostile foreign country, doing jobs they were not trained to do, without enough resources to support them, for longer periods than they were initially promised, while back at home we cut or suspend their military benefits. Now, I'm not saying that invading Iraq was a bad idea, but isn't it at all plausible that someone else, maybe even anyone else, could have done a better job at it? It might have even been as simple as waiting a lone, solitary year. How many people could have and would have waited a year?  Waiting might not have even been necessary if it hadn't been for Bush's biggest, most-colossal mistake: insulting most of the combined leaders of the world. Even before 9/11, America was lush with political and diplomatic capital around the world, and after 9/11, we had capital to burn by the truck-load (I was going to say tower-load, but thought better of it). It seems almost inconceivable that one man could turn so much good-will and sentiment towards the US into so much hatred and resentment in such a short amount of time, but Bush, through the sheer force of his ignorance and practically-paranormal will, has made the conception a reality. I could forgive him for turning our record budget surplus into a record budget deficit (the events and aftermath of 9/11 would have been difficult for anyone to budget for), But there aren't words enough to describe my outrage over his foreign policy mistakes. What is a president good for if not foreign policy? Please tell me how any other person on Earth good have fucked-up as bad as Bush?  That is my case against Bush, not that his overall decisions were poor (nearly anyone would have decided the same), but that he was incompetent in their implementations. He is merely a man of action, action that any number of other people would have taken. If he had also been a man of (true) vision, how much better off would the world, and especially America, be right now?

						   Infinity is at its root a simple concept, yet not many people understand it or apply it properly (when they feel the need arises). Mainly, when people say something is infinite, they mean it's just really big; they might even mean it's the biggest or the biggest possible. But the word 'infinite' used in that sense is a misnomer; it loses all attachment and relationship with its cousin 'infinity'. So what is the distinction between something that is really big and something that is infinite? With something that's really big, it has a definite quantity of dimension or aspect that can be compared with other things that are likewise defined. In this comparison you can make a statement qualifying a definite entity's 'bigness' with respect to another definite entity. By contrast, the infinite is necessarily indefinite in quantity and dimension, and as such can not be used to qualify anything that is itself definite. Much of this distinction is old news, and a person may misuse the term 'infinite' out of colloquial deference, but it is important to realize that this a lazy practice, and often leads to great confusion when dealing with matters of the infinite in a constructive dialogue.   All of this is but a preamble to my major point of discussion: the concept of infinity (as opposed to its common usage). When considering the concept of infinity, it is important to divorce from it the notion of 'bigness', for taken by itself, it says nothing about the definite size of a quantity (it can certainly say something about a quantity's indefinite size, however). The best way to describe infinity is in its proper application. When enumerating the set of natural numbers, a process of adding 1 to the previous number is used, and is repeated ad infinitum. This is perhaps how infinity was initially conceived in mathematics. The quantity of the set is not infinite because infinity says nothing about numbers. The quality of the set, however, is infinite. But why is the quality infinite if its quantity is not? The answer lies in how the set is defined: it is constructed through an eternally recursive process. This is what qualifies, as opposed to quantifies, the set as infinite. The infinite is the quality of being eternally recursive.

						   A standing wave is defined by a finite space, but a standing wave can also define a finite space. The universe is finite (out of logical necessity), which means it both defines and is defined by a standing wave.   Mathematically, the standing wave representation can be extrapolated out to infinite numbers of cycles or iterations, however, it makes no sense to do that, since all of the relevant information about the wave is contained in one-half of a cycle/iteration. Besides, lines of force near the nodes bounding the half-cycle will tend to cancel out thereby prohibiting the formation of complex patterns. In other words, the wave-form cannot bleed over the nodes into the ‘other half’; the ‘other half’ would, of logical necessity, be the inverse of the ‘real half’, and any sort of ‘contact’ or cause-and-effect relationship between the two halves would be logically incoherent.  Mathematically, the universe as a standing wave could be represented as a sum of an infinite number of waves of differing phase and frequency. Necessarily, there will be pockets of systems that seem to be self-contained, and they will give the impression of separate standing waves, but they will interact with each other and interfere with the standing-wave nodes of each other until the distinction between any two systems is blurred; some systems will collapse do to neighboring interference, and some systems will join forces with their neighbors. Since these smaller, localized systems are not truly self-contained but only have the appearance of being so, it is possible with enough imagination to cleave the universe in any number of ways to produce a plethora of logically-seeming closed systems.  Matter and anti-matter may be at polar opposites in the standing wave. If that is the case, I am unsure whether or not there are equal amounts of matter and anti-matter in the universe at any given time. Perhaps matter and anti-matter are merely seemingly closed systems that are almost entirely out of phase with one another. It does not seem to me that it is logically necessary for there to be equal amounts of matter and anti-matter in the universe at any given time, so long as there is a combined equivalence of matter and anti-matter over all times within one complete iteration of the universe.  The universe will ‘repeat’, in a sense, according to this model, but enumerating the repetitions is irrelevant; it is a single self-contained standing wave, and its motion or progression is only seeming.

						   Let me first state that I love outsourcing. What happens with outsourcing? American jobs get sent overseas! Does anyone else realize how great this is? Right now America is suffering from the worst trade imbalance in the history of the universe! Why is that? Because Americans are so darned wealthy compared with the rest of the world that we can afford to buy everyone else's stuff but they can't afford to buy ours. What we need to do is create consumers for our products in other countries. The first thing that a consumer needs is money, and the best way to get money is through a job. Now, the unemployment rate in America is a whopping 5.3% this month! There's a lot of potential consumers there. However, the unemployment rate in India, the 2nd most populous country in the world, is 9.1%! Folks, that's nearly double the percentage of potential consumers. When you consider that India has more than triple the number of people, the total potential consumer base is staggering. But they need jobs in order to become consumers. So what do we do? We give them jobs that we can spare and create newer higher-paying jobs back at home to replace them. What's the end result? People in India have more jobs and get better wages and can afford more of our stuff, which in turn increases our exports and works to right the titanic that is our trade deficit. Outsourcing can only help. By spreading the wealth and making the global economy stronger, it only improves our bottom line: better commerce and standard of living. America's economy is mostly self-sustaining at the moment, but imagine how truely immense it would be if other countries had similar wealth with which to pour into it.  Okay, let's tackle this issue more seriously. Let's say you're a highly-intelligent and motivated American employer, and you have to fill a newly vacant position within your organization. Now, you have a choice between Bob, who is a highly skilled and hard-working American citizen, and Punjab, who is a highly skilled and hard-working Indian citizen. But Bob is asking for twice as much as Punjab. What do you do? In order to compete with your evil nemises for larger and larger market shares, you hire Punjab to cut costs and lower prices (benefit number one goes to the American consumer of your product who will benefit from the lower prices). The immediate effect of this decision is to take one highly skilled worker off of the foreign market, and to leave one highly skilled worker in the American market. Now, let's say that your evil nemises, not to be outdone, use the exact same hiring practice that you just used to cut their costs and lower their prices. Well, now all possible consumers, both foreign and domestic benefit from this, but also, a higher premium starts to get put on foreign workers effectively increasing their average wages. The American wages in the meantime start to fall in order to compete with the lower wages in other countries. This allows new and cutting-edge American companies to acquire highly skilled American workers, that would have otherwise been gainfully employed, for practically peanuts. Eventually, the new companies will absorb most of the valuable assets left on the job market and the wages will start to increase in these new and cutting-edge fields. This sort of situation is a win-win for all parties involved.

						   This essay is about 6 years old, but it's so beautiful, I just have to  urlLink link to it . Here's my favorite part:  "In the final analysis, nations do not trade with each other; people do. Every international transaction that Americans engage in will, by definition, leave both parties to the transaction believing they are better off than before--otherwise the transaction would not occur. By this measure, the "balance of trade" is always positive, benefiting the nation as a whole."  Nothing I could say would add anything to his argument. It's sheer brilliance.  While I'm on the subject of deficits, here is a link about the growing US federal budget deficit:  urlLink Does the US budget deficit matter?   The budget deficit is a much different beast than the trade deficit, and this article just reminds me (like I need it) why I hate Bush so much.

						    urlLink The Case Against George W. Bush - by Ron Reagan   Wow, this is scathing. He's not entirely un-biased, but I think he does a good job of justifying his anger at the current administration.  I disagree with his assessment that the Bush administration is intent on telling lies. I think it's more the case that they're so incompitent and mistaken that un-truths can't help but be uttered. They probably believe 99% of the stuff they say, but only 1% of it is actually true.  I've never faulted Bush for his character, because for one, I've never met him, and two, I don't think he's smart enough to be truly evil. The complaint I've always had against Bush, since before he was elected, is that his mind is too simple.  A lot of people are instinctively drawn to simple minds, seeing them as innocent and pure, like children and pets. People trust simple minds, because it's easier to trust something you are superior to; you have nothing to fear from it.  I'm not afraid of Bush; he's already proved that even the worst-case scenario in the presidency isn't the end of the world (yet). Will another four years of Bush destroy America? No, but this experiment, testing the limits of America's resilience, shouldn't be taken any further.

						   What is morality? We use the term everyday, but it's definition is taken for granted. The American Heritage Dictionary defines morality as "a system of ideas of right and wrong conduct." This is a pretty good definition, and it is the one I shall use. What's hidden in that definition is another concept that people take for granted, the concept of right and wrong conduct.  Now by the American Heritage definition, it's possible to have a moral system where it's right to murder at one's discretion, and wrong to show any kindness to others, but this sort of system is not very good for acheiving the things that people want in life (unless what they want in life is to live by that particular moral standard). The qualifiers right and wrong must be used with respect to some end, ie something is right for some end and something is wrong for that same end. Depending on the end, any action could be seen as right or wrong. So now implicit in the American Heritage definition is the concept of right and wrong conduct towards some end.  When we talk about morality, we're not just referring to any old system of right and wrong, we're referring to a system of right and wrong towards a specific end. The specific end is usually only referred to implicitly in a nominative statement of right or wrong, such as "it's wrong to murder". Through stringing many such statements together, it's possible to get a broad, ill-defined view of a specific underlying moral system. But without explicitely describing the end, it's almost impossible to discover the full scope of the moral system; one would have to enumerate every nominative statement of right and wrong that exists in the moral system; an easy task for God perhaps, but most of us aren't blessed with divine insight.  The question "What is the end of man?" has baffled thinkers since the dawn of God's creation by man, and probably earlier. The end of man is vital to understanding fully the absolute morality that governs the correctness of man's actions. Any man that wishes to live well must strive to understand what he is for.  People consider the end of man from many different perspectives, such as "what is the end of man from the perspective of existence", or "what is the end of man from the perspective of a child", and so on. Looking at the issue from these many different perspectives is an interesting exercise, but they all share a common trait: they are all still perspectives of man, since that is where they originated. The matter is not simplified by removing the locus from man, on the contrary, it is obfuscated. Why would it be easier to understand the end of man from man's perspective of God's perspective, as opposed to just man's perspective?  Too often we ask "what would Jesus do?" when we should be asking "what would I do?". Perhaps people have an aversion to understanding themselves, and thus they can never answer "what would I do?", or perhaps they are scared of the answers they might come up with if they decided to answer that question: "would I really leave that wallet there and not steal it?", "would I really not take advantage of that drunken girl?", "would I really accept homosexuality?".  Now we're at the end, the end of man. The end of man is to act within his nature, just like everything else. It is natural for man to ask questions, seek answers, and create answers, even in the absence of rational justification. It is natural for man to act in his own self-interests, and to determine what those interests are, even those that may require a personal sacrifice. Above all, it is natural for man to propagate, both physically and intellectually. That is the sum of it. All of human morality can be derived from these ends. I leave it as an exercise for the reader to discover how.

						   I have to agree with much of Nathanael's analysis (although, I never agree with his tone). I didn't listen to all of the speeches of the DNC, but I did catch the majority of Edwards' and Kerry's speeches. I also caught a little bit of Sharpton's. I can't say I agreed with much of the uniquely-democrat platform statements. Most of the parts that I did agree with weren't in disagreement with Bush's platform. There really are only a few issues on which I'm enormously opposed to Bush's platform: gay marriage, abortion, and biological research (including stem-cell). I could nit-pick much else, but generally I'm closer to Republican than Democrat. I thought Kerry had the chance to distinguish himself by seriously discussing important issues -- I mean, he's winning in the polls due to anti-Bush sentiment rather than pro-Kerry sentiment -- but most of his words were hollow and were intended to excite the passions rather than sway the intellect (neither of which, I feel, he did very well, regardless of how those present at the convention responded). Needless to say, I was seriously let down, and that same day I had it in my head to vote Libertarian, as if to rebuke Kerry for his condescension. But as I cooled off, I realized that even if Kerry does not deserve to be president, it would not be right to condone Bush's unilateralism and narrow-minded view of world affairs by allowing him to be re-elected. Besides, the points of contention I have with him that I mentioned earlier are pretty important to me. I feel Kerry cannot do much economic damage with his policies because of congress, but he will be able to veto the sorts of legislation that I disagree with entirely. He will also improve foreign relations just by not being Bush, which I think is very important at this stage in the game when we're trying to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan and bring "our boys" home at the same time. I've heard that there are some foreign leaders who refuse to help because of Bush, not because of the cause itself. Maybe that's childish, but it's understandable considering the ego that is required to attain leaderiship status. Anyway, all of this is to say that I hate Kerry, and I don't hate Bush quite so much as I used to, but I'm still voting "against Bush". Another side benefit of electing Kerry is to keep Hilary Clinton out of running in the next election :)
