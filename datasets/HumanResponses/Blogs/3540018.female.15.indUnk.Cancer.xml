      okay so while Myers is at home pimpin it up on three hott cleveland guys..im sittin here debating whether or not I want to call Heath or not. He didnt come see me. He chose not to..but said he couldnt when I KNOW he could have. Oh well. That makes things easier I guess?  Ben..promised to come see me..and didnt. Therefore..im depressed. Oh well.  I almost cant wait to get out of here and just forget about everything for a week..and put my focus on God and helping other people out. Plus..I know Im gunna have fun while Im at it..even if I do have to wear a one piece bathing suit to the beach. The only thing im afraid of..is them seperating us..boys from girls..on the bus..or during other things. I reallllly hope they dont. Dang Homie..that would be bad.   I went out for my bday dinner with my fam tonight after I took my bag to church. We went to Ming..it was good. Mom said she got me a digital camera..my own..for my bday..but shes taking it back to get a better one or something. Doesnt matter..i wouldnt have been able to take it to Mexico anyways.   Today is my cuzin Katies bday..so Happy Birthday babe...and Sunday is my other cuzin Billys..so Happy Birthday to you too..and then Monday..is mine..so happy birthday to me..whoop whoop!  Welp...I guesss im gone...Wont be on this thing for 8 days..Holler at the cell while Im gone..write me emails..send me text messages..whatever u can think of..PLEASE! HOLLLLLAAA Fiddy

      So..I leave in 14 hours for Mexico.  I havent seen Heath or Ben. The Ben part makes me extremely sad since last year around this exact time..we were spending every waking moment with each other. But oh well.  Heath..well..hes another story. I dont even know what to say about him..so Im not gunna say anything. Lets just wait til I get home?  So..last night at my bday thing..we had talked about going to see a movie tonight. Well according to Davids little MSN name..only him Trevor and Justin are invited..which makes no sense for two reasons. 1..WE are the ones who planned it last night and 2..trevor told me earlier..and these being his exact words.."im going to the movies tonight with my best girl friend, *something about justin..i forget*,my best friend alison..and my bitch david"...so yeah david..sounds like we werent invited.. Forget you.  Anyways..now that im done bitching about everything under the sun. Im gunna go finish packing. Ill probably write one more time before i leave... holler

      I cant bring myself to actually write this..or at least I havent been able to until now.   I dont feel like talking about whats happened in the past few days since the last time i blogged so Im not going to. I had fun tonight. I celebrated my birthday with 9 of my friends at Applebees and it was fun.   I dont think I want to be with anybody in a relationship. Im confused. Im happy when Im with my friends. I like having fun like I did tonight. The "relationship" im in right now isnt that much fun. so...Im waiting until I get back from Mexico to decide if I really want this or not.   Im done with this. Goodnight.

      okay..so today I wake up around 11:15. I dont do crap until around 3 when i figure i better clean the basement like mom said before she gets home. Well when she gets home...she brings 5 11 year olds with her. So..I decided it would be best if i left for the night.I get in the shower due to the fact that i hadnt taken one in 3 days..gross. Myers me Em and Gled all go to Applebees at 7:30.I picked Emilee up and when I get there..Coby decides to walk to the door with emilee..as if hes her dad..waving her off to go to her first day of kindergarden. So after Dad is weirded out..we leave. WE get to Applebees and we start to eat. In the middle of it..this black guy thats sitting behind us at the bar gets a call on his cellular phone...decides he doesnt get service where hes sittin or something..so he has to get up and stand about 2 feet from our table. Well..when hes done with his phone convo I decide Im annoyed and need to make a smart comment about what he did. Apparently it was loud enough to where he could hear me. So..he gets another phone call and decides to stand 1 foot from our table instead of 2. So..I stare him down..and it was FUNNY..so. He shakes his head at me. He gets another phone call and stands up again. I think it was one of his hoes because he was gettin smart..he like started yelling..'WHAT COMES AFTER THREE..WHAT COMES AFTER THREE' so Myers turns around and yells "FOUR". hahaha. we died laughing. The guy starts talking about Myers to his hoe. "see the girl in the blue shirt right here even knows". it was good. So then I decide Im gunna take a pic of him with my phone to put on my display pic. Well..he starts saying.."dont take pictures of me up in here". So im like..."IM NOT". He doesnt say anything but gets off the phone and comes to our table and starts telling me that he wasnt talkin to me..it was someone else. So im like..sure nigger..go sit down? So then Myers tries to tell me I need to take fifty cents over to where hes sitting and smack it down and go "Wad Up Fidy" but I decline the invitation because Im not that brave...but it was Hilarious...but I think its one of those things where u gotta be there.Well finally we leave after we decide that hes probably famous and thats why he doesnt want ppl takin pics? I duno. So me gled and myers come back to myers house and ping pong it for a while. I beat Myers twice thanks. After that Glad decides she wants to hit the ball in the fan so that was fun. She left and Me and Myers played some more. I end up peeing on myself because shes crackin me up. Then..Heath calls and well..we arent on the best terms right now. Apparently he doesnt like talking to me when im with my friends..yet hes always with his and I dont have a prob with it..but whatever. So..now Im sittin here..Myers is talking to Aaron B on the phone. Jeremy Jon and Wade called her tonight and wanted us to come to Gee Creek with them but we decided to wait til tomorrow. Gee Creek is also known as "G Spot" now..hahaha thanks to Myers. So yeah..now Im bored. I gotta be home at 1:30 tomorrow to babysit Coach Earls' kids so thats fun. I love them actually..thanks. I duno if Im goin to the river tomorrow or if Im goin to "G Spot"...I guess ill find out later but im gone for now..Hollllla Fiddy

      yo yo yo. Okay so last night I actually ended up doing something. Me Heath Emilee and Braden all went to Myers house. We sat around there for a while and just hung out. Braden killed Heath with the ball in the eye. Lets just say,Heath wasnt too fond of Braden after that,but thats okay.So then we watch Jeepers Creepers and Braden wont shut up.Poor guy..gotta love him*muah to b*fetz! Anyways, Me Em and Heath leave and take Emilee home. On the way, I put in some Kenny Chesney and totally screwed up the words but hey, it happens. Hahahaha! *Oh WE SANG BOBBY MCGEE ON THE...*oops. hahahaha I wuv u emiwee! anyways..get home and Marni FINALLY calls me! We talk for like an hour then me and DJ get into this big religious talk. I love that kid. Then..I go to bed after talking to my cuzin about how better im becoming*mu hahaha*! Wake up at 8:35..call Amanda..she doesnt pick up..call back at 9..still no answer..so I head to church on my own which was okay because all teh guys showed up. Went to church..planned some tennis with hunter..came home. Heath came over around 2..we washed his truck cuz it was diiirrty. We did a GOOD job too..go us! Then we just layed around..he left around 5:20 and I ate dinner..and now im here bored...cuz hunter is hurting too bad to go play tennis.whatever.i still wuvs him. adios?  *One word thats all you said.Something in your voice caused me to turn my head.your smile just captured me.and you were in my future far as i could see.and i dont know how it happened.but it happened still.you asked me if i loved ya.If i always will.well you had me from hello.I felt love start to grow.the moment that i looked into your eyes.it was over from the start.you completely stole my heart.and now you wont let go.you had me from hello.inside i built a wall.so high around my heart i thought id never fall.one touch you brought it down.the bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground.and i swore to me i wasnt gunna love again.last time was the last time i let someone in.but you had me from hello.*

      Last night..was hell. I swear Im psycho. Heath gets online and starts talking to be about what were supposed to do tonight. The other day I told him my parents would be gone so we couldnt do anything here. Well, he must have forgotten because we start talking and hes like lets rent a movie. I agree and its settled. Well, since I had told him about my parents I assumed we were watching it at his house. He calls later on and asks what time he should be here. I was like...huh and explained again. And he starts up with.."then why did u say thats what wed do"? And so this whole big argument starts up over this little thing. We kinda settled it but we couldnt talk about anything else. It was awkward so I freak out and tell him Ill call him back. I get down here and start talking to Bek..she doesnt make me feel any better because all she says is "thats not the way to get Heath to like you" so I talk to Hunter and I love this kid. He makes me feel better..tells me to stop being stupid and call Heath back and apologize for going crazy over nothing. Plus he promises me that me and him will do something tomorrow. So..I call Heath back..he doesnt answer?..I leave him a vm and my voice keeps cracking so I sounded like a total man. In the middle of it, he beeps in. We work stuff out and talk like normal so Im happy again. We get off the phone at 2..were depriving each other of sleep..no joke. I get up at 9:30 because Dad wants me to go run with him. I go run a mile and a half. Come back..shower..nap. Now Im here..trying to work out plans for tonight since I have zero. Dad wont let me car date..how ridiculous is that? Its almost as if he thinks were actually going on a date in the car? I dont understand why he cant comprehend in his head that the only part that has to do with a car is getting where we are going? It really makes NOOO sense to me at all. But whatever My cousin is coming in a month and 8 days. My birthday is in 9 days...all I want is to be able to car date?hahahaha..or a laptop? Both preferably...yup thanks. Marni comes home in 2 weeks and 5 days..apparently she met a guy! Go Marnz! Hasta Lavista?

      Today was a lazy day..I got up at 12 and did nothing. Everyone seemed to already have plans so I got back in bed and watched Radio. Heath and I kinda texted each other back and forth but not too much. I sat around allll day..so I dont have much to talk about on that subject but I did just get off the phone with Heath for the night due to the fact that Im about to go to the movies with Sara and Emilee and hes going camping tonight and wont have service. I might spend the night with Sara..who knows?  So..I leave for Mexico in 7 days. I really dont even know what to say about that. It doesnt even make me mad anymore..mainly just sad. I dont want to leave here for that long. Things are good right now, Im happy with where I am, with Heath, with my friends, and I dont want to go and then come back and things be different. Heath said "he'll find someone else" while Im gone, I know hes kidding, but I still dont wanna be away from him for that long. I havent seen Hunter in what seems like a year. My birthday is 2 days after I leave, so I wont be doing much celebrating but I guess I wouldnt be doing much anyways, after you reach a certain age the parties arent too great anyways, which if you think about it, is really depressing. Its almost like people stop caring that its the day you were born 15 years ago but oh well..shit happens. Anyways I get back on July 4th and Im really hoping that I get back before the fireworks. If I do I promised Nikki that we'd go sit up on her hill like we did last summer. Today I wrote Nik this email of this song that really reminded me of her. It made both of us think about last summer and how it was me and her..and the rest of the world was just there, but didnt matter to us because we had each other. No one got in the way of anything we wanted to do or anything we wanted to say. It was Me and Ben..and her and whatever guy shed chosen for that week.Haha. And it was us..and us..was perfect. Nothing could ever compare to last summer, I just wish it was easier not to compare everything to it and start to hate everything because its not as good.  I just went upstairs about 10 seconds ago because I had on this nice shirt to go to the movies in and then I realized, I dont have to look nice because I dont have to impress anybody anymore. I have my Heath and Heath makes me happy. So here I am..In my ripped jeans, my John Mayer shirt, and my flip flops..happy..and ready to go to the movies.  And now Im stopping because..I just am..and I like being just me.

      okay...so right now, im in this mood..and I dont know which one it is yet and that bothers me beyond belief. Anyways, today I wake up to a call from Marni at 10:45,I could have killed her. But,it really didnt matter due to the fact that Tina and Heath both sent me texts at 11. Myers and Emilee got here around 12:15. Heath came a little later and then Rowdy and Sara came around 3:30. Between Sara falling face first into the water, Myers and Emilee screaming WHEETLE for some unknown reason, and Rowdy and Sara getting stuck in a tube, the day was pretty good. Well,minus the part where I got destroyed by all their little comments..ud think Id be usta it by now. Then we all go to Sara's and sit around there. I actually felt different around Heath today..like a good different..it was fun..AND were becoming experts at the whole "dodging the parents" thing..just so we dont kicked out of another house again...hahaha wow. ANYWAYS...Now..im bored..and I dont have shit to do. Trevor is making me angry because of his little hunter comments but whatever.  My dad found the pics of me and heath sleeping at Beks..he asked questions..but believed me when I told him the truth..thank goodness. Heath was gunna come over saturday to meet the rents but theyre goin to some luau so maybe ill just go to his house..then he can come over some other time. I guess well figure it out.. im done writing all this pointless stuff..i think im gunna go...kill myself..

      Its soooo hot outside. I think Im dehydrated. I just got in from laying out for an hour and I think im gunna die. Thanks..Im being a drama queen but u know u love me. Soo..Heath didnt call last night? But he sent me a text "Im not gunna be able to call tonight but ill call ya tomorrow,have a good night and sleep good". At least he was nice enough to do that. He hasnt called today yet either..Im getting worried but its only 3:54 so its all good...i think? New subject. I leave for Mexico in 10 days. Im not happy about this. I just realized that for four nights,Im going to be sleeping in some POS cabin in some POS campsite with a bunch of people I dont know. Then Im gunna go work my ass off for three days for some damn mexicans that cant build their own fucking houses. Gal Im sucha great Christian. The thought of going just puts me in this not so good mood. But Im going to church tonight to pray for forgiveness of my sins? thanks. But when i get to church..theyre gunna talk about Mexico some more...and its gunna put me in this even worse mood which will be fun so hooyah.  When im on this little trip..were staying in Texas..if i dont have phone service..im gunna be a little upset considering I wont be able to talk to heath for a whole damn week. If I come back and things are different Im gunna be sooooo upset it wont even be funny.  IM IN A BAD MOOD NOW...GOOD JOB...HOLLER

      Alrighty...I just had the best two days that Ive had in a long time. Lets see, yesterday I got up around 11, watched Crossroads cuz Im a fag, called Bek around 1:30,got ready,she got to the house around 3:30 or so,we went and saw Dad,ate at McDonalds,got in a noodle fight at walmart "GIRLS PLEASE LEAVE THE STORE",went and got Em,went to sno biz, went to Beks. We sat around there for a while and around 7:30 Mikey and Clint got there. They brought the movie Van Wilder and we watched it. Around 8,Heath and Robbie get there, we all sit around talking and kinda watchin the movie. After 2 hours of naked women and the guys throwing pizza rolls into the fan, everyone finally settled down and we watched O Brother Where Art Thou. Heath finally warmed up to me and we cuddled just a little bit. Around 11 all the guys left but Heath said he was gunna go get his truck,get zach,and come back. So he got back around 11:30. Emilee Bekah and Zach left us alone minus an occasional underwear tossing and flashlight shining,so we watched John Q. After that was over we just kinda laid there in the dark and talked. Then around 2 Zach made him leave. Me Bek n EM tried to go to sleep but it just wasnt happening for us due to the fact that we talked about damn nigg** chickens and Emilee kept saying "IF YOU BONE MY UTERUS I THINK IM GUNNA HAFTA DIE". We finally fell asleep around 5am and awoke to a call from Mikey at 10am telling us he was coming over for breakfast. Heath called a few minutes later and said he was coming too. Mikey left around 12:10 for basketball and football practice so Bek Em Me and Heath went to Castillos for lunch and Robbie met us there. We left and went back to Beks. We just layed around the house for forever then ended up finally leaving around 7 after Beks mom found me and heath on the couch :s *definitely embarrassing*! We go into town,walk around walmart for some unknown reason,go to Dairy Barn *heath bought mine :)*, sit there for forever then we all leave and split up. Me and Heath had no where to go so we ended up goin over and sittin in his truck at the senior activity center? hahahahaha! We talked for about an hour,played the "get to know u game" and took gay pics until Bek and Em came and got me and brought me home. I got here, took a shower, and now im here..doing shit..waitin on Heath to call since he said he would :). As you can tell, Im definitely happy and I definitely like this kid. Im not gunna mess this one up because i really hope this is the guy im finally gunna date. Anyways...I definitely havent talked to Marni much at all, makes me sad but I guess shes having fun, which is good. I dont think Ky or Jamie have talked to them either so oh well.  I think,or at least hoping, that tomorrow im gunna have some ppl over to swim cough*bekemheathmikeyclint*cough! ga im a loser..anyways..its 10:33 and im outta here...holllllaaaa

      Ive definitly tried to write this 3 different times but cant ever seem to get it done..but Im gunna do it this time so here goes..Im about to scream because our fag guests are annoying the shit out of me and they just need to go to sleep...facing idiots.hahaha. Anyways..so I get to Applebees last night with David Em Laura and Myers. Mitch Coby and Lauren showed up too and ate at the table next to us. It was fun. Around 8:30 Aaron B called Amanda up and told her that him and friend were coming to Athens and for us to meet them at 9:30 at the Dairy Barn. We got Mitch to take us there but we saw Blake Derrick on the way and they felt the need to race. So we go all the way down to Heil because "thats where the central folk race". Blake totally smoked us considering Mitch had 6 people in his car. They quit that and we finally make it to DB. Well Aaron shows up a little later and hes brought his friend Paul with him and let me tell you..the kid is HOTT. So we all sit there and talk for a little while then Me Myers Aaron and Paul leave and they take us to Myers house. Aaron made Paul sit in the back with me and he was so funny. He said something about having x-ray vision and i was like.."okay Superman" so then we started talking about SuperHeroes..but it got interrupted due to the fact that some faggot pulled out right in front of us and we camethisclose to wrecking. We were so freaked out. So Paul hops up and starts yelling out the window..FUCK YOU MOTHER FUCKER! hahaha it was soooo funny. Then he tries to get Aaron to turn around so they can kill the guy because "Pauls blood is flowing" but Aaron wont. So great. Then Paul finds his "doo rag" and puts it on and goes..."GUYS ITS STONER TIME" hahaha. It was so funny. Then Kenny Chesneys *Back Where I Come From* comes on and he starts singing..and wow..thats what I figured out that I loved this kid. He was so sexy. So Im all about this kid and we were gunna do something with them today but they had baseball so me and Myers ended up sleeping til 1,she showered,we get ahold of Blake and he takes us to my house so I can shower, get done there and we go ride around for forrrrever. It was crap. We go back to Myers and sit there til we hafta leave cuz the family hasta celebrate her Dads bday. Me Blake and LJ go to etowah to pick up Beau and take him to Jamichaels. Then we go cruise around again because were losers like that and then go back to Myers for about 30 minutes. LJ brings me home and I sit around here til 9:30 when Dad decides to drag the whole crew to Sno Biz. I see Charlie there though so its not all that bad. I go home and get a voicemail from Bekah saying that Im spending the night with her tomorrow because Heath is coming over and wants to meet me. So Im kinda hoping that I get to spend the day with Paul and the night with Heath and see which one I like. The thing is though..Paul hasnt showed interest in me yet really and Heath has. I might not even have a chance with Paul so Im kinda worried about what Im gunna do but I figure if I just sit back and let things happen itll go how its supposed to..so well see! So my first day without Marni wasnt totally bad. Im hoping I can stay busy while shes gone so I dont get bummed out again. I know shes having fun though, but me and Jamie are gunna walk to Hendersonville,NC now so im outta here.  *I wasnt looking for a lifetime with you.I never thought it would hurt just to hear "I do" and "I do". And I do a number on myself and all that I thought to be And youll be the one that just left me undone. By my own,hesitation And for the million hours that we were Well Ill smile and remember it all then Ill turn and go. While your story is completed mines a long way from done. Well Im on a champagne high. Where will I be when I stop wondering why? On a champagne high. Id toast to the futer but thatd be a lie. Spring turned to summer But then winter turned to mean. The distance seemed right. At the time it was best to leave. And to leave behind what I once thought was fine and so real to me. And while Im still gone on a quest for your song, Im at your celebration.*

      Hey guys..Thought Id go ahead and write even though, knowing me, Ill end up writing again later on tonight. Im bored. Today I got up at 8..went to soccer til 11. Came home, went outside and played with the dog for a little while. Came in, took a shower, then WhipDaddy came and got me and took me to Marns so I could say goodbye for real this time. We were supposed to stay for like 10 minutes but ended up staying for about 3 hours but we had fun. We all got in Andrew's bed and watched tv..and you know thats always fun..so yeah. Then..it was time for her to leave. I wasnt gunna cry..I really wasnt..but then DR hugged me and I lost it. So I like..made myself actually leave and cried in the car but hey its all good. Nathan and I went to Mexi Wings and he bought me my cheese dip since I didnt feel like eating and he made me anyways. Okay so I did tell him to go somewhere but I wasnt all that hungry after crying but whatever. Anyways, I got home and was informed that the gang was going to Applebees at 7:15. So now, Ive got about 10 minutes to fix my hair until David gets here to pick me up so I guess I better go. But before I do..I gotta tell ya..Im supposed to meet this Heath kid from central and Im reallly excited cuz apparently hes adorable so thats fun. Bekah is trying so hard to find me some one..bless her. Haha. But yea..gotta jet..   *Well He said whats the problem baby, Whats the problem? I duno well maybe Im in love,love think about it everytime I think about it..cant stop thinkin bout it...Turn a little faster..the world will follow after..because everybodys after love..were accidentally in love..* <-- best song*

      Okay I totally over-reacted earlier. Ill be the first to admit it. But Im gunna go ahead and tell you about my day cause Im totally in a Bloggin mood right now. So I wake up at Marns around 11. We lay around..do shit. Andrew all of a sudden comes in Marnis room butt naked. All he has on him is a pillow hes holdin over his wang so I dont have to be forced to look at that. So I leave around 12:15 or so. Get home..call some people..tell em to come over around 4. I go outside..lay around the pool..do shit again. 6 freakin o'clock rolls around and still none of my friends are here. Emilee finally shows up. We come in here and ask Marni and Tina where the hell they are. Tina says she cant come..blah blah. I start crying and call Christner because well..just because..and he was really sweet and made me feel better. I wuvs him :).Anyways.. Marni says shell be here later. Around 6:50 I somehow end up getting Hunter grounded because he had me call his mom and beg her to let him come and apparently she didnt like that so hes grounded..but in mine and hunters households usually that word has no meaning,therefore when he gets home from camp..itll all be good and hell be out everyday like normal just like i would be. Anyways..7:45 and Trevor and David finally get here. The 4 of us go swim and then Marno arrives. We all swim..yada yada. We get really cold so we come inside. At 10 David and Trevor leave after we all talked to Davids mom and she made these really wierd noises like "AFFLACK"..i duno..something about a duck? Who really knows? So..Me Marn n Em come in here..make a snack. Around 10:30...Rowdy and Bristol drive up. They stay for about 20 minutes then leave and take Em and Marn home. So Im here alone for about 5 minutes til Myers shows up outta nowhere. Apparently she thought Sara was here and she was supposed to spend the night with her but uh..I dont think I saw or spoke to Sara all day. Little misunderstanding there..its all good. Rowdy and Bristol come back and pick her up. After that, my day got even better because Ben called me. See, Ben and I go back, but we wont get into that because I could seriously talk about him and how great he is for...forever..but I wont make you suffer. But anyways, he calls..we talk for a while. Me and Him have a lotta catching up to do. I honestly havent seen him in a month and whenever one of us calls the other we never talk for more than 5 minutes because were both so busy. But anyways..I get off the phone with him and Marn calls. We talk for a while but then I decide to go shower. Shower..come back..Bens online so I talk to him. I showed him this blogger thing I got going on and he totally made fun of me and told me I needed help because I have too much time on my hands. But ya know what mister..I cant drive so what am I supposed to do? A thank you. So now..Im sitting here..typing in this thing so he can make fun of me some more. I think I have soccer at 9 in the morning. Tryouts I suppose. Marni leaves tomorrow so I think I might give her a little surprise before she leaves me here alone for a month. I definitely cried when she left today. Shes my best friend and Im not gunna see her for a whole freaking month. What am I gunna do? This girl knows everything about me and yea..so when Im having a break down and Bens too busy with this "big life" he leads..who am I gunna call? Whos gunna lick my face for the next month..or who am I gunna build lego castles/offices with..or play mario with..or go to walmart with at 2 with..or take gangsta pics with..or go tubbin with? I mean come on..all of that stuff is important in my life and Im gunna have to deal with talking to her once a day on the phone? Thats just not gunna cut it. I think I might have to go visit her..not even kidding. Hey Dawgz...I leave for Mexico in like 2 weeks..and my bday is in 16 days..how cool is that? whodi yeard.  Okay..so Hunter leaves tomorrow for this Basketball Camp at Duke and wont be home til Thursday. I didnt even get to say goodbye..so Im really sad. Im hoping that he'll get my message that I left him earlier..probably wont though. Maybe hell think of me while hes there and call..but thats doubtful too. Who really knows? All I know is this blog is too damn long and Im out like no doubt. Holler*

Well today I finally thought it was gunna happen. I talked to everyone and they said they were coming. They all had stuff to do but said they'd come after. Well its 7:35 and Emilee is the only one here. I skipped soccer for this whole get together thing and now Im gunna get bitched out tomorrow for nothing..but it happens. So yeah..Im just a little upset. Okay maybe Im being a lil dramatic here but I really am upset..so great. Well...I guess me and Emilee are gunna go do something?

      Okay, so I already blogged this morning but after I wrote that little thingy, I decided to go upstairs. It was about then that Molly, my neighbor, called and asked Taylor to come over because she was having friends over to swim. Therefore I had to call my friends and cancel my plans because Mollys come first due to the fact that its her pool. So..my friends are now coming over tomorrow to swim. After that, I went and showered then Matt was online after and asked to do something. I told him to come pick me up so he did and we went to the Dairy Barn. After that we were just riding around and Nick passed us. We followed him and ended up at Rowdy's house. Matt ended up playing some playstation game with him until I made him take me to Amandas. Got to Amanda's, waited on her to get ready then we went to the central baseball game for some odd reason. When Bekah got there we decided to leave due to the fact that no one else was there. Bek took me to Mom at the Farmhouse and Mom brought me to Marnis where I am now. A while after I got here some of the Whipple Pack came over. We went down to the kitched where they were all eating. They left and Marns Mom made them Ice Cream cones and told me and marni to take them down to them in the basement. When I go to hand Andrew his he trys to stick it in my face cause he said he didnt want it. I kinda run away then I went back for some reason, I dont member why now. Well, all of a sudden, Whipple grabs me from behind, Mike gets my hands and holds em down, and before I know it my face is COVERED in Ice Cream. Well, I go up, wash it off. Me and Marn go back downstairs to see if our cookies are ready. They are but then we realize we dont have any milk. So we text Whipple and he says hell take us. We end up going to Wal Mart for an hour and running around because thats like the best thing to do in A*town. Get back here, eat some cookies, come upstairs, sat around then decided to play some Mario. Well Marni ends up playing like 6 levels then we decide to build a Lego Castle. I was totally set on it being a castle then Marni wants to make it some kinda office? Uh..whatever? who builds a lego office? I mean...come on...its gotta be a castle. Well after about 30 minutes of that and almost finishing the roof off, she knocks the bitch down. Im like..."Nigga wad u do that fo". She goes..."dude..im tired of this shit" I say.."Nigga Wat"..she says "Nigga Who" then oddly we both say "Nigga suck my dick bitch". I dont know...I guess its one of those telepathy things? Anyways..now were sitting here listening to Britney Spears after numerous tries to get her Furbys to work. Gal I usta hate those things but now, I dont know..something about them just..turns me on? who knows? Well...I think Im gunna go. Big day tomorrow..Tinas comin here in the morning, then were heading to my house for a while with everyone, then who knows? Hasta Lavista Negro!

      Alright so I actually woke up before 1 today. Got up at 11 so go me. I had this reallllly weird dream last night but we'll get to that later. Can i just say that last night was extremely gay due to the fact that my friends decided to act like they were in 2nd grade. First..Me Marn and Myers decide to have a SuPeR SiX day today. Well, David finds out when I ask Trevor to come and totally goes crazy about how I need to keep my friends close and my enemies closer? Im like "uh..David since when are we enimies". Then I had to explain to him that the six of us got extremely close this year so sometimes we like to just hang out with US..because we're just wierd like that. Finally after being weird about it he texts me apologizing since i pretty much let him have it when he called me. So anyways, Trevor and Myers start getting into it about who knows what? I think Bekah? I dont know? So Im trying to referee this one and make them not mad at each other. I tried to make them realize how redamndiculous they were being but they just wouldnt have it. Anyways, after I'd had enough of listening to them tell each other to "let it burn in hell", i yelled at both of them then went to bed. I think they worked things out, Im not sure though. So..I fall asleep and thats when I have my psycho dream. I was at school and I was in 6th period which was my hon bio class. Well I go out in the hall for something and all of a sudden I see this giant blob of black gas coming at me. It comes into me and makes me still for like 1 minute and makes me say weird things. Then it comes out of my body and then all of a sudden theres more black blobs of gas and they start doing that to everyone. So I run down the hall to Mrs. Comerfords room? No idea why..I havent had her as a teacher yet? and she tells me to go find this girl that I know of.I cant remember her name now. but anyways..I find the girl and she explains to me that we all need to leave school. So me and Derek Slack go into the office and try to tell the secretary whats happening. She doesnt believe us until the black blob attacks her. Then she starts freaking out and doesnt know what to do? I leave the office and I see people like Allison Ward and Nikki Davis in the cafeteria..and theyre all about to or have been attacked already. So then I start running to Coach Earls room but Mrs Harrison *the dream schools principal* stops me and yells at me for not having a hall pass. I dont even yell back and tell her whats going on cuz i dont think shell understand. Then it just kinda ended? I duno..I think I had it because I watched some of XMen2 with Dad last night? who knows... Anyways, Im gunna go now because Marn Myers and Trev are supposed to be here in an hour and moms friends from Oklahoma are gunna be here at like 4:30? I dont like them but she does so whatever..I just wont be around the house this weekend. Im gone

      Okay peoples, You know how I kinda mentioned that guy that "was making me sooo happy" and how i get to meet him? Well I definitely met him today. He wasnt bad looking..most of my friends thought he was cute but when he was here today, his personality caught me off-gaurd. I mean, he was really nice but it seemed like he was tryin to show off in front of his friends. But I dont know what to do? Why cant I just find a guy that is exactly how I want him? I wish it was as easy as it sounds.  Anyways...merging on...so Rowdy Nick Aaron and Mica come over today. Nick and Mica stayed for a few minutes but Rowdy and Aaron ended up staying longer. Eventually I give Marni the signal so she brings up teh fact that we gotta go to her house to get ready to go to Emilees. Yea definitly have the best friend in the world. Anyways, get to Marnis, hang out there, go to Em's and the guys there again. We didnt talk? so Yeah..i guess i was nervous? uhm..I just got home from Emilees and now Im talking to Bekah about how Id like some Jake Heath..or some Justin Hicks..or some Bekah Nesbitt? apparently me and Bek are dating now? I duno? whatever. Tomorrow, Im hoping to go up to springbrook with Brett Hunter and Marni but I duno yet. Blah? Im gone..holler?

      Hey Peoples! Its June 7th and I just woke up out of Dreamland as Glad would say! I wouldn't have woken up if I hadn't been called by church to tell me that some of my forms for Mexico aren't signed and that they need some thing called a birth certificate? Yeah..anyways..so didnt end up writing again because I talked to Aaron for like..2 hours last night so thats fun. So now Im sitting here while my mom is picking up my grade card and probably killing herself over it. Im just not good enough I guess. Oh well. Hopefully she'll let herself calm down on her way to Knoxville and back and uh..not be so bitchy when she sees me.  Anyways..(ive decided thats my new favorite word)...what am I going to do today? Hmm..I may call Rowdy up..see what he is doing. Sara's gone so he might be kinda bored. Maybe we could go play hide and seek at Wally World since none of my other friends like to do that. I really want to go to the lake but I dont have anyone to go with and the weather appears to be sucking today. Maybe Ill see what Tina and Marni are doing but I really don't want to go back to the club because Dad gets mad when he sees too many things charged on his account. Oops. I could just wait til Hunter calls me..but that could be at like 12 tonight. Hmmm...maybe Bekahs available today? ahhh who wants to hang out with that loser? okay so I do..and I also LOVE how Im officially rambling on now. Its quite fun. Im bored though..so uh..whatever? Hmmm I know I have more to say. Oh yeah..everyone needs to pray for Tina because three of her friends were in a bad 4-wheeler wreck and one died and the other two are in ICU still. Just thought Id stick that in there. Anyways..I guess Ill let you guys stop reading now. But no worries..Ill be back :)

      Ok..Im definitely in a good mood but Im home alone..and im bored..so therefore..im writing in this thing. Anyways..went to Meghans last night..had fun there..played some volleyball..ate some food..all that good stuff. My coach tried to have a "heart to heart" with me. He told me that Im a good soccer player but that if I wanted to be great Ive got to motivate myself and work on my fitness and work by myself and some shiz like that. I wanted so bad to say.."you can sit here and tell me this stuff...but I dont like you..so youre not really gunna make a difference..thanks" hahaha. But I couldnt. So yeah..annnyways..got home..took an hour long nap to wake up to a phone call from my new guy :)...who will remain nameless until I actually meet him Wednesday. Never met him before..but Ive talked to him on the phone quite a bit and I think im gunna like him. One of my friends who knows him says hes cute..so im excited! And Im finally happy..for some reason the kid just..makes me smile :). Just talked to my cuz Katie..shes coming down here this summer for a little while..so we can spend some quality time together and she can see how boring and "non-dance-clubbish" it is. hahaha.There s 23 days til my bday and I had this dream last night that my parents let me drive before I got my permit..I guess i had it since Ive been BEGGING for them to let me drive and they wont. Oh well I get my permit in like 30 days..due to the fact that Ill be in Mexico on my bday so thats fun. Anyways...gunna go clean the basement before I go to Marnsalots! Latttter.

      Okay...so i def posted..not even an hour ago and in that short amount of time ive become completely frustrated with..hell i dont even know. Half of it hasta do with my two friends who dont know what the hell to do with each other. I cant get anything through anybody. the other half is Hunter..yeah its probably pissing the world off that i wont shut the fuck up about him..but honestly..i try not to care..but ya just cant help it sometimes..and I dont know who to talk to about it without gettin on their nerves so therefore im screaming my lungs out on this thing. its almost like i expect the damn computer to talk back to me or something. How ridiculous. Then youve got these guys who are cocky sons of bitches..and like.."oh..who wants to jump on my dick"? uh HELLO..APPARENTLY NOBODY CONSIDERING UR ADVERTISING UR DICK TO THE WORLD AND NOBODYS THERE WITH YOU HOPPING ON IT CUZ ITS APPARENT DUE TO THE FACT THAT UR PATHETIC ASS IS SITTING ONLINE. thanks. Then youve got those ppl who think they own the whole fucking world and its like..uhm..theres what..4000000 billion ppl in this world..and u can act like u know every damn one...but hunny..you dont. Thanks again. yea..some ppl just need to wake up and get out of their own damn worlds and realize that theyre making asses out of themselves..and what the hell am i talking about cuz im the same way half the time but at least im not all "oh i need sum dick..come get in bed with me" yeah..uhm..I feel like ive written a fucking book but im starting to feel better..yeah..yeah..I love summer..because u can do whatever the hell u want and unless u feel the need to tell the whole world what uve done over ur sn..they dont know about it..because school is like the gossip capital of the world and that just sucks..what the fuck am i tlaking about? AHHHH have i mentioned i wanna scream? yeah thanks. now that i just went back and read what i just wrote im starting to laugh at myself for gettin so worked up over shit. damn...that line..shit..marni u know what im talking about :(. anyways... Okay so considering that ive been golfing so much..Ive realized that when guys stand in a certain position on the golf course..its dead sexy. cant really describe that positon..but believe me..its hott. yeah thanks..uhm..im going now..to do shit :(

      Okay..So i was reading Beks Blogspot today..then i saw Marn had one..so I figured..what the hell..Im always venting to everyone..so why not do it on here too? exactly.  Anyways..lets see...today..I woke up at like 10:30..after a long night ;). I end up singing my wake up song like usual to Marnster..and then I go shower. I get out..get ready..then go to pick up Marn and go to springbrook. Well..we get there..and we end up waiting for forever for Tina to get there. While we're waiting, Brett and Hunter show up. This leaves me feeling somewhat frustrated and sad. See..For the last two weeks of school and the first week of summer, Hunter and I were exxxxxtremely close..spent everyday together. Wed known each other since first grade and i considered him one of my best friends and well..all of a sudden..last monday..he decides not to speak to me..and hasnt since..and this..upsets me. Because..well it just sucks when your best friend wont talk to you. so anyways..if youre still following, Tina finally gets there and we go golf. Well we catch up with Brett and Hunter so Tina ends up golfing with them while me and marn are just along for the ride..or the drive in some cases. Annnnyways..we get to hole 17 and well..theres a SCATTER sign..which means..u gotta drive ur golf cart in one direction or the other..well Tina likes to make these HARD turns..and this time..it was a little too hard..I ended up falling out of the cart..scraping my leg..and in the process..peeing alllll over myself. So yeah..we finish up while Im totally embarrassed..and then I go in the bathroom and dry my pants with a hairdryer..spray them down with smelly stuff..so im good to go..Front nine..no problems..Me and Marn leave due to the fact that I have soccer tryouts for school. Well..I get to tryouts..we do this thing where you can get like 16 points..i end up with 4..thanks. I figure it doesnt really matter though..Coach Earls knows me..so its all good..no sweat. Then..it starts to rain. So..I come home..and now Im here..posting on this gay thing because im cool like that So...im going to finish by saying that I love kylie and marni and bekah..well shes my bitch. Thanks.. Mall tomorrow! whootie!

       I love how I sit here for...forever and just stare at this..thinking about what to say. Im so mad right now. I wish my parents would just divorce..things would be so much easier.    &nbsp;  i dont even feel like doing this.   i feel like shit and im tired of it.   Adam didnt call tonight.   I called ben..caitlin answered..and someone told me to quit calling him?   blah?    &nbsp;  no one understands the relationship me and ben have..and i dont think anyone ever will..except maybe nikki..but im not so sure she understands anymore because we havent talked about it.

      I got this from Beks blog..I liked it..so i stole it..hope u dont care babe...Member..I love you and im here for you :)   Clocks only go one way. Each second you watch go by.. you can never get back. If it was bad, you can't go back and change it. But what's worse, if it's good, you can't go back and relive it. Don't say things you'll regret. Life's too short. Don't fight with people you hate. Don't fight with people you love. Just let it all go.. because nothing's worth it. Cherish every moment that means anything. Hang on to them. Keep things to remember stuff by. Take lots of pictures. Live life to the fullest and never let one day go by without something meaningful happening. Never waste a day. It's too short guys.  I put that in here because its true. Bekah might be a fag sometimes..and she might be a lesbo sometimes..and she might have obsessions with *minorities gone wild* sometimes..but shes right. God took Zach because it was his time to go. Even if it doesnt make sense.I didnt know him..at all..but death is never an easy thing to deal with. "People never die as long as someone remembers them"-sb.  So..with that aside..and on a happier note..today was good. Got up at 11..went to marns at 12:30..it felt good to be home :) muhahaha. hung out there til 3..then i left her to go to the mall..bought tons of good stuff.*including a moshi* went to eat at Macaroni Grill..i didnt like it..but oh well.Came home..went to see Anchorman with Marn-Myers-Glad-Justin-David-Hunter-John-David. It was one of those movies thats so stupid that its hilarious. at time i hated it..but at other times id be laughin so hard id almost pee on myself..which if u know me..know that isnt hard for me to do :). Welp..now im home.. and heres my song for the night..thanks.  Jesus..I pray take all my mistakes..throw them away..destroy them for my sake. Jesus i call out cuz im sorry because I fall so short of your glory. To the best of my ability im practicin humility and i lay myself before cuz less is more. all that i have i lay before with my pride on the floor..cuz to u less is more. all that i have i lay before with my pride on the floor cuz to you less is more. I pour out myself..all that i am..you love me so much..that you fill me again..and may these words on my heart on my lips..somehow mean so much more than this. Jesus i pray..know what im tryin to say.all that i have i lay before with my pride on the floor..cuz to u less is more. i pour out myself before you oh Lord..i hold nothing back cuz to you less is more. and may this words on my heart..on my lips..somehow mean so much more than this. Jesus i pray..just know what im tryin to say.Jesus i plead..please purify me..make my heart bleed.drench me with your mercy.Jesus i pray..i love you i need you. for the rest of my days i swear i will seek you. to the best of my ability im practicing humility and i lay myself before cuz less is more.  --less is more--relient k

                          I like this song A LOT!                    Getting into You - Relient K **> When Ive made up my mind and my heart alone with that, To live not for myself but yet for God.Somebody said.."do you know what youre getting yourself into?" When i finally ironed out all of my priorities and asked God to remove the doubt. It makes me so unsure at ease. Things I ask myself,i ask myself, "do you know what you are getting yourself into?". Im getting into you because you got to me in a way words cant describe. Im getting into you because ive got to be. Youre essential to survive, Im gunna love you with my life.When he looked in the inside. I kinda view u as a son. For one second our eyes met and I met them with a question. DO you know what you are getting yourself into? Im getting into you because you got to me in a way words cant describe. Im getting into you because Ive got to be. Youre essential to survive. Im gunna love you with my life.Ive been a liar and ill never own up to the kinda person you deserve to worship you. You say you will not dwell on what I did but rather what i do. You say I love you and thats what you are getting yourself into you. Im getting into you because you got to me in a way words cant describe. Im getting into you because ive got to be. Youre essential to survive, Im gunna love you with my life. IM getting into you because you got to me. In a way words cant describe. Im getting into you because Ive got to be. Youre essential to survive. Im gunna love you with my life. He said I love you and thats what you are getting yourself into.   Okay..So I talk to DJ on the phone til like..12:45 last night due to the fact that he was bein a butthead and wouldnt let me get off.

      Ive been home for what..4 days. All I seem to want to do is go to church. I mean..thats a good thing..but its so different then what I used to be like. I went last night and loved it. Even though I didnt get to swim due to the fact that I didnt have my sexy one piece with me, I still had the best time just being there, with people who wanted to be good Christians just like I do now. I dont see the point in doing the things that I used to do. I love just being the good girl that I was before I got to the jr high. Chelsea was at church last night. At first..I was furious..I kept telling people how I could be at church with her every day of my life and still never forgive her for what she did. Then, she started talking to me. Id try to walk away but shed follow,or at least thats what it seemed like. Bless. Haha..so.Myers ended up inviting her back to her house after with me n David so yeah..definitely ended up talking to her. I guess it was just God's way of working through me. So..were good now. Which is great I guess..before it didnt really matter cuz we never spoke to each other..but I guess im glad were okay now.   Anyways..Marni comes home tomorrow.Ask me if im excited. yeah buddy im excited! Im like..freaking out cuz I havent even talked to her in a week cuz shes been so busy I guess..but starting tomorrow night..Ill see her everyday..minus the rest of my vacations..but thats okay!  Okay..So Heath..I really didnt think Id miss him as much as I do. Im really not sure about this whole thing. He got online the day after we ended things or whatever..and said all this stuff that made me cry..when I was okay until then. I havent talked to him since Monday. He said he might call sometime. He hasnt yet though..but whatever. I figure..I dont see him a lot of places because we go to diff schools and have diff friends..so once I can just get over the fact that I dont have anyone anymore..then Ill be okay. I just kinda miss having someone to cuddle with and *kiss my forehead*..yeah..ill shut up now.  **Lets start this over..its not like were dead. Was it something I did..Was it something you said. Dont leave me hanging in a city so dead. Held up so high..Im such a breakable thread. You were all the things I thought I knew and I thought we could be. You were everything,everything that I wanted. We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it. All the memories so close to me just fade away.All this time you were pretending. So much for my Happy ending. Youve got your dumb friends. I know what they say. They tell you Im difficult. But so are they. But they dont know me. Do they even know you? All the things you hide from me..all the stuff that you do. You were everything,everything that I wanted. We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it. All the memories so close to me just fade away.All this time you were pretending. So much for my Happy ending.Its nice to know that you were there. Thanks for acting ike you cared and making me feel like I was the only one. Its nice to know we had it all. Thanks for watchin as I fall and letting me know we were done. He was everything, everything that I wanted.We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it. All the memories so close to me just fade away.All this time you were pretending. So much for my Happy ending.**

      I wanna start out by saying..Mexico was AMAZING. It was the best experience of my life. I dont even like being home. I want to go back right now. In this blog..Im going to talk allll about my trip...so if you dont want to hear about it..stop reading now.   So we leave on Saturday at 6 am. I get on there and sit with Amanda. We attempt to sleep but people like Adam Leland and Holly and Brittany were tooooo freakin loud. So we get frustrated and already get mad at these people on the way there. We stop Saturday night at a church in Beamount Texas to sleep there because there was a Johovahs Witness convention taking up every hotel around there. Sunday we get to camp in Texas on the border around 4:30 or so. Me Brett Myers David Tyler and Hunter are going crrrazzy...cussin more than Ive ever cussed before because this camp was ridiculously bad. I mean..it was crazy how bad we were actin. We go to dinner and they give us this food thats supposed to be Lasagna..but we couldnt decide if we wanted to drink it or attempt to eat it with a spoon. Then we go to chapel and theres this video about the staff..blah blah..then this guy named Jim Weber gets up there and tells us hes our music leader for the week. So we start singin these songs..well the 6 of us that I mentioned before are thinkin we're too cool to sing these songs. So..then this guy gets up there and speaks about the week and does a little devotion then we go get in our church group away from everyone else and have this little meeting. It was short. So then we go to cantine. Then the day was basically over. So after 22 hours on a charter bus, sleeping on a hard floor, and realizing that I wasnt thinking when I agreed to go on this trip..I went to bed. I woke up on Monday morning at 6 am, and it was my birthday, so everyone sings to me. Then we go to breakfast and Mr Bond makes me stand up and everyone in the camp sings..Then we go get ready to go into Mexico. Its about a 50 minute drive into Mexico and then we get to the Colonia. It was sad. All the hispanic people came out of their homes and were waving. They all seemed so happy even though they have nothing. So..we get to our worksite and our family seemed really nice. They were old but had a grandchild living with them named Hesus..I think thats how u spell it. He was adorable but really shy. So we started building our house. That day went by really fast. We got back to camp and went to dinner which wasnt as bad that night and then went to worship. They had this screen on power point and on it they put.."is alison van wagner here..blah blah..stand up" then they all sang happy birthday. Then it was the usual..singing and devotion..still didnt sing. Then we went to small groups again and it was short. Went to cantine..came back and i walked in and Liz asked me to go to the bathroom with her..and she did it in this weird way like something was going on. Millie had streamers in her hands..and told me she was decorating Amandas bed...? I was like...ooook. So i went to the bathroom. I came back in and the lights were off and they lit 4 candles and put them on a zebra cake and had decorated my bed with balloons and streamers. It was really sweet. We go to bed..get up at 6..blah blah. I get to the worksite and its my day to work at VBS. Well..I met this little girl named Adrianna that was 10. Me Todd and Blake played with her for a long time. She was adorable. It was like I had this connection with her even though I couldnt talk to her. Throughout the week me and her became very close. We left work early that day and went ot the Mexican Market..went back to camp..dinner..worship..small groups. This small group was different. We broke up into girls and boys groups and talked about whether or not we were empty of God..or Full of God. We stayed in that group for 3 hours talking about it. We all cried a lot because everyone just opened up. It was just really emotional. Went to bed late that night..went back to the worksite Wednesday. Saw Adrianna right as I got off the bus. She came up to me and just jumped into my arms. It was an amazing feeling to know that she remembered me and to know that she wanted to hang out with me. I went to the worksite and worked all day. We had all of our house done except for the linoleum on the floor and the shingles on the roof. We go back to camp..usual stuff..get back in our girl/boy groups again. It doesnt last as long this time but is still pretty deep. No one cried though which is good. Thursday morning come and we're all feeling a little depressed because its our last day on the worksite. We get there...and again..Adrianna finds me and jumps in my arms. I took her to my worksite with me but eventually she ran off to go do something else. We finish our house and dedicate it. Eat lunch..then I get a little sick. So..I had to go ride around in the car to get some air. Well...I didnt get to say bye to Adrianna because I couldnt find her before we left. I didnt think much about it even though it upset me. We get back to camp..dinner..worship..small group..blah blah. Get up Friday at 7 because they let us sleep late. Go to the beach..have fun there..get back..dinner..worship. At worship we sang more songs and then the director of camp got up there and told us he was proud of us and all that jazz.Then they showed a recap of the week on video. Then...they showed another video of all the hispanic children in the village to the song "Remember Me". I started to cry a little but it wasnt bad...THEN..the last kid on the tape was Adrianna. I lost it. Then we were on our way out to small groups and this guy from Nashville named Hunter that I had become friends with through the week..just grabbed me..and hugged me..for about 3 minutes. And..I duno..it was just an amazing feeling but also sad at the same time. We went to small groups and some things were said..then we went to cantine and I hung out with Hunter a lot and met some other new guys from Nashville. I got a bunch of addresses then it was about time to go to bed so I went and walked with Hunter to our cabins..we stopped and sat down and talked for a few minutes..then we had to go to bed. So we hugged goodbye for about five minutes and he said hed call and all that jazz. So I go to bed..and were all sittin around and finally we all get quiet and turn out the lights. About 5 minutes later Mrs. Ruthye yells.."OH MY GAL..AND IM NOT KIDDIN THIS TIME..TURN ON THE LIGHT..TURN ON THE LIGHT"..we turn on the light and theres this big turantula..*sp*..crawling across our cabin floor. We all start screaming sooo loud. It was ridiculous. Finally Ruthye and Tammy get it out the door but now were all too scared to sleep. So..we play cards. Then we realize that were too tired to stay up so we go to bed. We get on the bus at 6 the next morning to head home. Drive about 15 hours and stop at a hotel in Mississippi. Get up the next morning..leave at 7..and get home at 4:30.   The trip was amazing. It was so much more than what that sounded like. I become so much stronger in my faith and made so many new relationships. I also learned that you really cant take for granted what you have. I also am trying to be a better christian and let this experience stay with me.   I left out a lot of stuff up there but I want to keep a lot of it with me..and only me and the people that were there.   It sucked coming home. It felt like the first hour I was home I was already faced with so many challenges. Me and Heath are over with as of now. Its complicated..plus thats another thing I want to keep with me and only the people Ive put my trust in with it.   But im done for now..holler?  **I have my compass and my guide/And these companions at my side/And Ive decided I am ready to begin/Something old was drowned forever/When I crossed the cleansing river/But I rose up to find something born again/And your path stretches into my future/But it seems such a long way to go/So upward and onward You're calling me/I want to go whereever you lead/Higher and higher to face the unknown/And follow your call until you call me home/This mountain path is getting steeper/And the valley's looking deeper/And Im weaker,but Im closer to my hope.  ---Upward and Onward*Jim Weber

       Okay so I get up today around 9:15 cuz I had to go shopping for school clothes. I get ready and me and Mom leave around 10:30.  We go to Old Navy..nothing there...Target..nothing there. So we go to the mall. I hate clothes. I cant fit into any jeans right unless they are American Eagle because no one carries jeans for short people so thats fun. I find about 4 collared shirts, which I think is horrible because I thought all my ones from last year sucked, and 3 pairs of jeans. Well..I come home and decide to try on every single shirt i owned and every single pair of jeans. I realize that my old shirts dont suck...they just look like crap on me when im not tan..so in the winter..im SOL i guess. Well..then come the jeans..which definitely put me in the worst mood possible. I couldnt fit into a single pair except for my AE ones from last year. I love that store. Anyways...im in a BAD mood now. I go to practice...get there and not a single person says hey to me except Katie. Like..I know they probably dont mean to..but like..it always happens. Me and Katie never get talked to. Its weird. Jackie and Jocey and Loren and some others will tlak to us more than anyone and I love them to death..but its just..different. Everyone has soo much fun at practice because they have all these jokes and stuff..but like..me and katie are just...there. I dunno..it sucks..but whatever. So I go to DB...get home...eat...shower and now im here. My phones still dead which sucks, but I should get my charger tomorrow night. Katie is coming to get me at 10 tomorrow morning so we can go run. We gotta get in shape. School starts in 6 days..which is weird but good cuz im ready for everything to start up again. I need to get off my butt and make some friends and junk. The way I see it..I have four friends now that I plan on sticking close to...other than that..no one but thats okay because thats the way ive made it for myself.I dont need 10000 friends to be happy right? right. Id rather have a few close friends i can trust then 1000 and not be able to know who to trust. But yeah...thats all i have to write about for now. Holler back.    *Finding my way back to sanity..take a breath and hold on tight..spin around one more time and gracefully fall back to the arms of grace.. im hanging on every word you say.*

       Okay...so last night I went to see Little Black Book with Marni..and let me see..its like the best movie Ive ever seen. SOoO cute. After it was over Andrew came and got us and we went to Sonic. Went home and of course I jump straight to my third Gossip Girl book..i know i know..im a nerd but those are the best books ever. If you never get a chance to read them..then I honestly feel for you. Everyone needs to read these books about rich teenagers living in NYC who have amazing partys, amazing sex, and amazing lives. Im not kidding. Okay..def done being a nerd. Uhm so we finally give up on reading when Tina calls. Blah blah. We just like..sit there..and do nothing..cuz were cool like that. Andrew comes in there and starts talking to us about how hes leaving in like 10 days for school :(. Then he decides he wants to draw pictures on Marns notebook and a penis on my foot..so thats fun. We probably sit there like this for about 3 hours when finally at 3 we decide to go to Steak and Shake. We get there...eat..yum yum..come home..go to bed at 5 after discovering a few things that happened weeks ago between two certain someones that bugs the hell out of her and i get to listen to it for 3 weeks now. Anyways..get up this morning about 1..eat breakfast that DR cooked for us. Go upstairs..lay around..watch about 3 episodes of The Assistant..4 episodes of Newlyweds..then half of an Ashlee Simpson show. Then..after that..well..all I gotta say is..*thong tanlines*..thanks. Uhm..then I leave and go run with dad around 5:15. Come home..eat dinner..and the rest is history.       Definitely havent talked to Adam in a few days. Last thing I got was a text message telling me he was too tired to call but hed been thinking about me all day? I was like..."uhm..okay whatever..bye" yeah im a bitch..this i know.       So Im sitting here now..with an almost dead cellphone and no charger which im NOT happy about..bored off my ass...that being the reason why im blabbering on this thing. Im done   Holler    Sometimes I feel like I need to shake myself to wake myself   I feel like Im just sleep walkin through my life   Its like Im swimmin in an ocean of emotion    but still somehow slowly goin on inside   I dont like who Im becoming   I know I gotta do something   Before my life passes me by   I wanna cry like the rain, shine like the sun on a beautiful morning   sing to the heavens like church bells ringing, fight with the devil and go down swinging   fly like a bird, roll like a stone   love like i aint afraid to be alone   take everything that this world has to give   I wanna live   sometimes i wonder why i work so hard to gaurd my heart   when i  hardly feel anything at all   i spent my whole life building up this outward tower   now that im in it i keep wishin it would fall   so I can feel the ground beneath me   really taste this air im breathing   and know that im alive

       Wow...Definitely havent been on here in forever.  I went to soccer camp and had a blast. It was fun and all. I came home and the Tuesday after I got home my cousin Katie came to visit from New York. We hung out here all week. Had people over to swim everyday. Went out to eat a few times.  Then we left Friday night for the beach. We got there and went to Grandmas and Grandpas. My Aunt Kristen, Uncle Tim, Sean, Jake, and Sammy Jo were there. Theyre from Texas and all. We talked to them for a while then went to the beach house. We were the first ones there. After a while, Aunt Karen, Uncle Charlie, Anthony, Abby, K.C., and Ashleigh the babysitter got there. Theyre from Maryland. Then my Uncle Ken, Aunt Anita, Jeff, and Brandon got there. Thats Katies family. We all sat around and ate pizza and stuff for dinner. Went to the beach, blah blah. While I was there I slept, ate, went to the beach, swam in the pool, read,banana boated, slept,ate,slept,ate. Yea it was great.    Aunt Karen - she's my favorite aunt cuz shes cool as hell - I talked to her a lot about everything. I love her daughter Abby - she's four and soooo adorable. Im gunna go visit her during Christmas break. I think Marni might go with me. So yeah...   Thursday night all 30 of us went to eat dinner for my Grandpa's 75th birthday. It was sad because he stood up after we gave him all his gifts and stuff and said "Thank you all so much, we're gunna meet back here in 2 years for our 50th anniversary and I WILL be here"..i started to cry cuz hes got lung cancer and all and yeah..it was sad. Then I had to say bye to him and my gramma, and my Uncle Ken, Aunt Anita, Jeff, Katie, Brandon. My great aunt was crying her eyes out so that made me wanna cry and it was just a sad night.  We get back to the house and I find out about Ben's dad...that sure wasnt fun but then marni told me about this thing in the newspaper about this guy coming home and finding his wife mowing the yard the wrong way so he started chasing her around with a chainsaw..hahahaha. gal Athens is the place to be..lemme tell ya.    Anyways...today I went to lunch with Matt because we hadnt talked in forever...so we went and spent a while like we used to. We were together everyday for a long period of the time last summer..wed go drive around town singing at the top of our lungs to his country music, or wed go ride brooms in Big Lots..haha..hed actually let me drive sometimes. Aww i love matt.   Okay...Im going to the movies tonight with Marni..thatll be funn.    Im done boring you all now..thanks for reading :).
