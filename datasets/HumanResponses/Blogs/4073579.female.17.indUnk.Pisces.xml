        'Tis yet another day.  I suppose I'm glad the weekend is here.  I never was too fond of the weekends, but since summer started everyday feels like a weekend.. until the weekend comes. [by the way there will be times in which I make no sense and ramble]  Actually the reason I'm glad the weekend is here is because I feel as though I am finally able to take a break from my projects.  I have too many going on right now for my own good.  If I were smart I would just work on one at a time and finish it, but what fun is that?  yeah.

         Attempting to gather a (small) crowd for the ghost tours here in Lancaster.&nbsp; And possibly the ones in Philly, and Ocean City, NJ.&nbsp; You know you want to come...      average, $12 1 hour -1 1/4 hours candelight tour through the town, 7 pm or so.      More details to come.. maybe.

         Obviously I'm new here.&nbsp; I figured I would create one.. what the hell, right?&nbsp; Sure.   
     
     &nbsp;
   I don't have much to say.&nbsp; Lots of things I need to be doing right now, don't feel like doing them.

        Well, unfortunately I've just found out some bad news about a friend of mine that I haven't seen in a little while.  It's sad to think how things change sometimes.  I wish I would have been around more.

       Today is Wednesday, therefore Josh and Hunter came over to hang out.  Hunter was only here a few hours, Josh left less than an hour ago.  Now my eye seems to be hurting me.. sorta sucks, but what are you gonna do, right?   sigh , I don't want him to go away..

        Watching the kids went pretty well I guess.  When I took them back to their house for a few hours before their parents came home, they just fell asleep on the couch right away while Josh and I watched   The Butterfly Effect  .  I like the concept.. but I would rather dwell on it in my head for a long time then to see it played out.  But that's just me..

         Glad that it's  Friday the 13th .  Pissed that I had to babysit the kids.  Have to tomorrow as well.  Josh will come over, maybe we'll take them to the park.  Drowning in water fountains.  Such fun.

         Well at this point life is quite decent.  Who knows what tomorrow may bring, but like the title says, I don't much care.  The park was fun, aside from the bug bites.  But the water fountain kicks ass... you'd have to see it to understand.  A person could drown in it.    Oh the possibilities.

        Hmm.. not really anything to say for today.  I haven't played MOTAS in awhile.  This saddens me.  Would you like to play   urlLink   The Mystery of Time and Space    ?

        I have to say   The Village   was not as good as I had hoped.   I liked when Noah stabbed him though. That's all I say so as not to give anything away.
