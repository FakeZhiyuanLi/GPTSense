      yeah so yesterday i stayed up late with a lot on my mind...i put what was on my mind on paper and here it is...   It seems anything I want I can’t get It’s always out of my reach, and I can’t take it no more My love has left me, I’m cold and alone My soul quivers and shakes trying to escape my cold heart I’ve lost sight of the light that once I saw shine so bright now it to a miniscule flame delicate enough that I fear the slightest breeze the chains that bind me hold heavily against my heart the key I’ve locked away in the darkness I’ve grown within My whole body’s numb my pain and suffering is like novicane (supposed to be Novocain but I can‘t spell)  it’s been poured over my delicate frame and I’m numb from the pain My esteeme is low as it is my walls crumble in I’m lost in myself I don’t know who I am anymore Why I’m here? Why I live? My being is obsolete with iron locks and chains  I try to lock away my pain the suffering grows expands till it grows to big it consumes me I have nowhere to run no place to hide! I hurt inside I cry I scream…nothing nothing at all my outer self refuses to give in even when I fall even after I die the mask stays on Each time a wound opens a new mask is there  in it’s place I don’t know who I am anymore I’m a stranger to myself I don’t know how I feel whether it be pain, sorrow, hatred, what! My feelings are mixed I just want it to all end Maybe then my pain will go maybe then I’ll know the answers to my questions left unsaid maybe, maybe then…There’s hope through small a hope is there I can only pray Pray that one day one day in my bleak future I’ll break free Free of these chains that bind me in pain That one day I’ll feel the warmth of light, love, happiness…    you decide what you make of it. I also went through other writings i had scattered throughout that notebook...and found this...   Anger has such a way with words Sorrow is often felt in my despair Pain is present everywhere I go Suffering is what I scream out Hatred is what feeds my soul Agony is what rips me apart Death is my welcoming friend My anger consumes me It turns me into a monster  I stare at the mirror and realize something All those lies are true all my pain is real I’m worthless to you; no one cares They should be happy when I’m gone Whish is why I open my arms with a smile on my face And I’m welcoming death now as my friend  To long have I lived with this hate and anger! To long have I suffered from this pain! I wont take it any more! Just take my life away! Kill me now! *laughs* What are you afraid? ALL I WANT IS TO DIE! So kill me now!  Now I laugh in your face Full of tears, for what? My lose? I did you a favor one you can’t undo I welcomed my friend, Death! I wont suffer, I wont hurt, I wont… Hey, What the HELL! I still hurt and bleed! No! Death is my friend Death has become me…Death is my friend! NO! Death my friend don’t leave! Death…Die…Kill…..   hmmmm more talk of death...surprised i haven't actuallykilled myself yet? sometimes i am *evil grin* here's another i found...   Why does it feel like I’m being dragged down?? Did I ever do anything Wrong? How come my life has to be this way? So much pain and sorrow I hope strong I don’t know who to trust anymore I don’t know who’s my friend There’s no on to turn to  No where to hide I can’t get away From my feelings I hold inside What happiness I dare do find I cling to with my life For I know now ever so well It can be taken away from me In the blink of an eye or a heartbeat of day And not come back to me I’m so confused how I feel right now Am I say, hurt, in pain? Even in my own little world I’m coiled in sadness like a snake I’m empty inside  I don’t know what to feel Still a bitterness is near I deny myself how I really feel And move on in my life I wait in agony for the next day to come In hopes that I will bring A hapiness that last forever Even if it’s just a dream…   a bit more hopefull...but still angst...enough for now?....

      on another note...i'm really not that depressed right now...just kind of...i dunno but here's my latest poetry...i'd post it on fictionpress.com but i can't upload anything so screw that! so here it is...   Tormented Thoughts…    Crying My tears run like a never ending river They form of pain and hurt everlasting They are the blood of my wounded soul  Needing I’m lost and confused Wishing for someone to come hold me tight Tell me everything will be ok  Hurting My open wounds are rotting I’m torn apart like a thousand stabbing knives The pain is never-ending like the constant flow of my blood  Wanting My heart yearns to be filled with love My soul wishes to wash away the years My self being looks for a way to survive  In a world that doesn’t want anything to do with it  Ending Death can seem the only way out But in the end is it really? Is there a true end to the beginning Or does the cycle just go on…

      yeah highlight of the day...band practice...haha...  yesterday Kaleb (my bf) came over to hang out. It was fun, but then he told me that tomorrow he's leaving to go to Boys state for the week. I wont get to see him for a whole week!! *tear*....*sniff sniff*....i gonna miss him! I'll be countin days till he comes back! (haha yesh i know i be pathetic)...  hrm my parents were fighting again a few moments ago...but they just stopped. That weird silence that always follows at night is sorta freaky..and weird....and yet a relief.   my latest darker poem is titled "Lifeless" here it is   A dark nightmare plays in my head Thousands of tiny nails scratching the chalkboard Demons spawned within plague my thoughts Mixed feelings collide; forming a raging storm All reality has been lost; emotions locked in sanctuary I am left empty; lifeless merely a reflection of life, I walk A human figure void of true “life” inside   i have no clue when i wrote that but i remember it was one night before i went to bed when i was just feeling empty and alone inside.   hrmm that's strange, one of my internet friends said he'd be right back about an hour or so ago...and he still hasn't gotten back on. guess he got kicked off. Hope he didn't do anything stupid! He said if he didn't find a girl soon he wouldn't be here much longer! he worries me sometimes, but he's a cool dude to talk to! a fun friend, but he lives in Cali!! wish he lived closer so we could hang out!   which reminds me my other guy friend who does live around here is comming over tomorrow to play with our kittens. I had no clue he liked kittens...guess I learn new things every day! guess that's it...later

      I guess today wasn't to bad. Normal boring day. The plus was that my boyfriend came over. It was fun, we watched a movie. I hardly get to see him, so any time together is good. Well all was well until the end. My mom called me up for something, and we got in a small argument. That just pushed me over the edge i guess. Something inside me just snapped. A small gloom set over me. Then we were watching tv (my bf and I) and my dad gets home, of course my parents start to fight. Anyways. I dunno what happend from there. I just totaly fell apart. I wanted to cry so badly, but i dont know why. My insecurity must be comming back. After i tried so hard to surpress it...it comes back to haunt me. Why? Every time I am able to confront and conqure my sorrow...it comes back ten fold. Now i just feel depressed again. It hurts. I want releif, but my relief is gone for now. So of course eventually i gave in to my boyfriend, and just cried. I sat there and cried until he had to go. It wasn't long, but i still had no reason to cry. So it was pointless. But he said it wasn't, perhaps he's right. I dont know...I dont know anything anymore...why wont this darkness just leave me the hell alone!!!

      not that anybody reads this, but i could give a flying fuck if they did. I dont care. Anyways. I've been better at not being sorta depressed, but still. I get in trouble a lot, still, with my sarcasm i use with my parents. I can't help it, its like second nature now. Anyways. I really dont have much to complain about now that i have a boyfriend (of about 7 months now) so yeah. He keeps me in check with reality, but i still have many secrets and hidden darkness that i dont think even he knows...  Just personal pain, torment. Self-image isn't a problem. Self-esteem, yeah, but that's always an issue. Just secrets i hold to myself...but...yeah...  I'm starting to get fed up with everyones Bull Crap about my BF. They complain to me about things they dont like about him, instead of telling him. Everyone has their faults, so i dont know why they cant get past that. Then again...sure. W/e, i'll just leave it at that. Its summer, i should be happy. And i am, but i'm not...just a mix i guess. guess that's all for now. hopefully i'll post here more often. but who knows.

          Really...my life is boring. I'm 15 and STILL haven't taken driver's ed, I dont have a job, and I'm usualy locked away in my house!! how fun...What few friends I do have I rarely see, and what VERY few BEST friends I have...almost all of them are ignoring me currently. You see my one best friend I haven't seen all summer because she was supposed to move away, but didn't, and her parents are really strict and dont get along with her really. Well I usualy talk to her via MSN messenger, but lately when she's on i'll say "hey what's up?" but she'll never reply to me. So i'm guessing she's just ignoring me....when school starts things will be interesting...my other friend who DID move...is currently in AZ. We used to talk ALL the time on MSN then a little while ago she signed on and I said "hey" and she replies with a "Go away! Leave me alone!" then "Bye!!" and she just signed off. I e-mailed her, but she hasn't e-mailed me back, and now SHE wont talk to me. And I have no fucking clue what I did to either of them. so yeah two of my three best friends aren't talking to me for reasons I dont even know! My other best friend is on vacation, but we're gonna do something when she gets back! ^^ which is the only plus to this whole  WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO TO GET YOU MAD AT ME?!?!?!  Situation. *long sigh*....I've actually come to realize I really dont have that many friends at all. Plenty of acquaintances...but very few friends. Not that it matters much...but still. Though it does make me wonder if I really am that pathetic a person/friend??...who knows! I really shouldn't care, and to a certain extent I dont....so yeah. On a lighter note *cheesy smile*......*long silence*....erm....well I guess I can't think of anything on a lighter note. Only that my life is boring aka I have no life. I have friends who hate me/wont talk to me right now for reasons I dont know. I feel like crap today. I dont have hardly any close friends. Anything I'm remotely good at i'm failing at miserably (aka writing and playing piano). I see no future for myself. I have low self-esteem. And on top of that i'm supposed to be this "always happy and willing to help oh so perfect angel" girl...when i'm probably totally opposite of that!! grrrrrrr!! plus I think most of my life is just a lie, but hey, ITS ALL GOOD! *note heavy sarcasm* anyways. I'm bored so i'm going to go surf the net! laterz!!  hrmmm...now that I think about it. I dunno why I complain about my pathetic life here, or anywhere for that matter. Its not like the human race should/would/could give two fucks about my life. wooo you know my dad yelled at me and called me stupid for using the word "fuck" today. But he was getting me annoyed and pissed off so i cussed. Mr. "Oh i'm so perfect" is just a little more than annoying about 24/7 of the time. *sighs*...is it bad when one wants to actually BURN their own house down??? it is?? err....perhaps I should keep my thoughts to myself ^__^ but that wouldn't be any fun! I enjoy making people who've never seen me or know me think i'm a complete nutcase! Mind games are fun! but really I'm nothing like that, I'm actually a really nice person once you get to know me! You really shouldn't judge someone by a bunch of words in an online diary...they could be a bunch of BS or total flat out lies ^^ for me...who knows which are which. But I'm no liar...well...most of the time lol haha...am I confusing you? and who am I talking to? guess it doesn't matter! I can talk to myself so there! *sticks out tongue* =P haha.....well enough of making you think i'm totally insane and should be on medication! Bye....
