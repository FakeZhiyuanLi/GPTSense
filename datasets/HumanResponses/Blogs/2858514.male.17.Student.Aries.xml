      Today I knew that Physics need to do over 10 long questions and submit at next monday. It's really time-consuming!!!! Also Chinese composition is one of the weekend homework, I can't imagine what will happen in the coming Saturday and Sunday.

      HKCEE is coming... less than 20 days... Very nervous...  This week is a good week. Every day I went to school to study. I have done many past paper and discover that I'm very weak in Biology. Well, Bio isn't in my consideration list of S. 6 subjects, so just let it be...  Study with friends is really a good thing. When I have any problem, I can ask them. Puzzu and Aries are very smart, they helped me a lot. So, I'll try my very best~  I've done a lot of MC. My average result is good, but not good enough. 8-9 wrong questions at average for Chem and Phy. Next time I will do Phy Paper 1, Phy is really really important...

      由中四等到中五，長逹兩年的抗戰終於完結了。我的感覺當然是非常之輕鬆，但一下子由努力温習到没有事幹真是令人難以適應。在這段無聊的日子中，我的主要節目自然就是上網。一開ICQ ，便見到不少平時甚少online的人，例如Puzzu, Andy等，和他們聊聊天，真的很開心。  這個暑假橫跨整整三個月，看來要找一些東西幹幹。Puzzu ， Andy都分別找到了暑期工，Eddy更報讀了電腦班，他們的暑假將會很充實。而我因六月要遠行，所以工作還是下月才找吧。  P.S. 最近無綫的劇集愈來愈没吸引力，唯有把一切寄望周末及周日明珠台罷了......

      I got an amazing news when i surf the MSDN web site. The .NET 2.0 beta has released! Waiting for this for months, I downloaded the Visual C# Express and Visual Web Developer Express and use it. Wow!!! It's incredible. Although they're slow and a little bit unstable, I can try the new features which is very interesting. The Login System in ASP.NET 2.0 making me can add membership feature without writing any code! Now I can make a good-looking web site in no time!  The graduation dinner has ended. Out of my expectation, the graduation dinner is quite boring. The food is just normal, the programmes is a little bit boring. So I just talk to John the whole night... By the way, everybody dressed beautifully that night. At that time I realized we are becoming adults, not children any more.  July will be a boring month. But I think I'll try my best to learn typing as soon as possible. Also, I will study complex number and conics by myself. Don't call me crazy guy~

      I know it is strange to have two posts in a day, but I really have something to say in the afternoon. I have decided to write my posts in English as my English typing speed faster than that of Chinese and I can train my English during writting.  Graduation dinner is coming soon. This is probably the last chance for F.5 classmates to play together. I'll treasure this chance anyway, since I may not see them in the next school year.  I've had a talk with Aries through ICQ. He told me that it's better to take some posts in F.6. I understand his point but I really know too few people and I'm introvertive, so teachers won't find me to take posts of the clubs. Besides, I would not be able to do the job well if I had a post! But still, I'll try my best!  Many days had passed since the end of the CE, but I haven't done anything meaningful. I just sit in front of the computer for a whole day. Yeah, it's a waste of time, so I'd better find something else to do as soon as possible...

      玩了ASP.NET都有一年多了, 但是技術仍舊十分之低, 就連稍為像樣的Guestbook也不大懂做, 真是冇鬼用. 做網頁呢家野上手容易, 但要做得好卻不是這樣簡單. 加上自己沒有一點art sense, 唯有找多一些tutorial web sites研究研究了......  C#是我寫ASP.NET的主要語言, 語法與Java/C++相似, 都頗容易學. 不過.NET Framework Class Libraries實在太大了, 根本沒可能通曉, 單是一個System.Web就已累死人了. 但是不少外國的Programmer都說.NET有前途, 以成為Programmer為目標的我看來要繼續努力!  自己的中文打字很慢, 拆字又廢. 單是打這篇東西就用了半小時, 不行不行......  愈來愈覺自己孤僻, 真的要找找朋友啊!

      While I'm surfing the web I found a software called Reflector has released its new version, so I downloaded and installed this new version to see if there is any difference. Reflector is a decompiler for .NET. It can decompile the .NET programs and components to IL or  even C# code. It is very useful since I can use it to view how a function is implemented in the .NET Framework. When I started the program, the Reflector let me chose the .NET Framework version, including 2.0 one. I clicked the 2.0 one, and the program worked fine. I tryed to open the mscorlib assembly and decompiled a method in the List  class. Wow, the decompilation process worked smoothly and I can see the C# 2.0 code! So I can conclude that the Reflector works woth .NET 2.0! How amazing it is!

      Yesterday I went to the library and borrowed a book which talks about the C++ Standard Library. Today I've finished 1 chapter, which introduces the STL(Standard Template Library). STL is very powerful, the major data structures and algotithms are implemented in it, so programmer can use them instantly. But since C++ is too powerful, it is very hard to write. Mistakes can be easily made, and hard to track. Also pointers make me feel dizzy! Well, it may be better for me to concentrate on C#. And I'm just a programming newbie, though.  I don't why today I feel very sleepy, may be I play too much computer or my holiday is too boring...  Just tried the client callback feature in ASP.NET 2.0, it's very fantastic! So calling server-side code need not postback any more!

      Data management is easy in ASP.NET 1.1, but it still require coding to add functionality to sort, update and delete data in a DataGrid web control. But now in ASP.NET 2.0, using the new GridView control and SqlDataSource control, I can enable sorting, paging, update, deletion function with only several clicks. This greatly increases efficiency and shorten the time for developing data-driven web applications.  The new membership controls in ASP.NET 2.0 also simplifies the development of web applications. By dragging some controls and setting few properties, you can set up a web site with membership feature. In other server-side technology such as PHP, it needs a lot of coding to add login functions and manipulate session variables. In ASP.NET 2.0, all the coding is done by M$, programmer no longer needs any coding. So everyone can develop professional web site in no time.  And this is only the ASP.NET 2.0 beta version, so I think in product version the features would be more complete and verbose.

      While I was going to write this post, I spotted on the site that I can apply for G-mail, an E-mail service hosted by Google, so I went and tried to apply. And after a few easy steps I set up my G-mail account. The special feature of G-mail is that it gives every user a 1000MB space! So there is no need to delete mails any more and I can store some mail with big size. My g-mail address is kenleung5e28@gmail.com.  This afternoon I'm still playing with Visual C++ Express 2005. I can mix .NET and native code in the same file, or even the same function! So, I can enjoy .NET and STL programming together. Both technologies are great! Thanks, M$! (It is the first and may be the last time I say thanks to M$.)  P.S. I've gone to McDonald's this afternoon and ate many food. My stomach is full now~

      In the past two months, I've heard some news about a new C++ syntax from Microsoft to allow easier .NET application development. This new C++ syntax is called C++/CLI. It fully implements the features of CLI, making development as easy as using C#. And the most exciting feature is that C++/CLI allows unmanaged(traditional) C++ code and managed(.NET) C++ code to be used in one single file. After installation of Visual C++ Express 2005 Beta, I started to code using C++/CLI.  First, I used the new syntax to write a simple .NET Console Application. The syntax is not hard and it is clear. So I can use it as if using C# or VB.NET. Next, I followed the How-tos to try the interoperability between .NET and native code. Surprisingly, the interoperation is simple and two different platforms can be integrated seamlessly. For example, I can transfer an .NET array into native C++ code to create a STL vector, which can be used normally in native C++ code. That means in some degree, STL is integrated into .NET Framework!  Here is an example code demostrating how easy is .NET array working in a native function:    #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; #include &lt;iterator&gt; #include &lt;algorithm&gt; #include &lt;functional&gt;  using namespace std; using namespace stdcli::language; using namespace System;  #pragma unmanaged  void Testing(const int a[]) { 	vector&lt;int&gt; v(a, a + sizeof(a)); 	sort(v.begin(), v.end(), greater&lt;int&gt;()); 	copy(v.begin(), v.end(), ostream_iterator&lt;int&gt;(cout, " ")); }  #pragma managed  int main() { 	array&lt;int&gt;^ a = gcnew array&lt;int&gt;{6, 8, 12, 33, 7, -4}; 	pin_ptr&lt;int&gt; p = &a[0]; 	Testing(p); 	Console::ReadKey(true); 	return 0; }    As you can see, it is very easy to let .NET and native code working together. I'm really looking forward to the release of .NET Framework 2.0.

       While I&nbsp;am writing this post, typhoon signal number 8 is hosting. But the weather isn't too bad, and it's cool. Anyway, this typhoon isn't very strong, I hope nobody would get hurt under this typhoon.    &nbsp;  By the way, I finally understand quicksort. I can explain every step of quicksort now. This algorithm in fact is very easy, the code is&nbsp;easy&nbsp;to write, and have a high efficiency. The next step is to read through the algorithm and implementation again, to get a more thorough understanding.    &nbsp;  Next month is a critical time for me. The release of HKCEE result has a great affection to me as it is going to determine whether I can study F. 6 and where will I study. I hope everything will be fine and I can have a wonderful life with my friends in STMGSS.

      Finally, I decided to study some sorting algorithms. I have read the principle of quicksort, but I failed to understand the implementation. The partition step is short but I just understand a little bit. I need to work hard to handle quicksort!  Python is a really good language for studying algorithms and data structures becauese it is simple and powerful.  Another target for me is to study conics in my A. Maths textbook. Although I have plenty of time, I don't know whether I can achieve my target before the end of the summer holiday!

      Last night I dreamed of the day of release of HKCEE result. In the dream, I got a bad result and I could not go back to STMGSS. After I got up, I felt a little bit frustrated. But I may be worrying too much, so I decided not to think of HKCEE any more.  Tow days ago I finally finished a web page which obtain server data without using postback in ASP.NET 2.0. This feature is really powerful, I think I'll try to master it in order to build powerful web applications.

      This morning after having morning I continued to do a. maths. The process was smooth and I've done all the exercises about parabola. Tomorrow I will do ellipse exercises. I hope I can finish the topic of conics before the release of HKCEE result.   Time passes quickly. It's almost time to think about HKCEE result. I'm optimistic, I think I can obtain enough points and get back to STMGSS. But the result won't probably be very good and I don't expect I can get an 'A'. Grading is not important now for me, being able to be in the original school is my only wish now.   My mathematics is not very good, but not bad. I think I won't face great difficulties on studying Pure Mathematics in F. 6. At higher form there are only 5 subjects, but they will be very demanding. I don't consider it as a problem since I enjoy the process of learning.   I'm so bored that I'm thinking what will I do after 11/8 if I can successfully get back to STMGSS. I've decided to buy textbooks as soon as possible and start studying it. You may say I'm crazy and&nbsp;I really am. I don't want to have a hard life on F.6, so pre-studying is a good method for me, and it also can kill some time. Anyway, this is only the best case. I haven't think of worst case yet, although the chance for it to happen is quite low.   Life's like a game and examinations are just parts of it. HKCEE is most exciting part of the game, don't feel frustrated when you lose, as&nbsp;the game has to continue anyway.

      Today's weather&nbsp;was still terrible. The rain&nbsp;was heavy so I don't want to go out. During the writting of this post, a heavy rain has just stopped. Anyway, staying at home means I can concentrate on thinking what I'm going to do.   As usual, I turned on my computer and surf on the Internet. After looking at some web sites, I started the Visual C++. Thinking for a while, I decided to write a quicksort function in C++ language. The procedure was smooth but the testing program just didn't give the correct result. I tracked the program for after half an hour I found the error is an "if" statement. After correcting this error, the program finally gave out correct results.   In the afternoon, I read a computer magazine and discovered an interesting program called ArtRage. It is a drawing program which likes the simplified version of Painter. I downloaded and installed it. The program ran fast and the interface is simple. It has serveral drawing tools like pencils, oil paint, etc. As my drawing technique is extremely poor, I just scribbled for a while. This program is really great, it is very realistic. So I think I'll recommend it to people who like drawing.   This afternoon I opened my Additional Mathematics textbook and started to do some questions about conics. Few weeks ago I finished reading parabolas so I did some questions to familiarise with it. Luckily I haven't forgotten all my maths, I'm still able to do the questions, but the speed is quite low. Speed isn't important at the moment, the&nbsp;most important thing is to understand.   Many people on the Internet argued that working at I. T. industry is not good since&nbsp;we need to learn new things all the&nbsp;time. I agree with them but I'll still set programmer as my&nbsp;target. I like programming, so&nbsp;having a job that one's like is the best. Although programming technologies changes all the time, it won't be too difficult to learn since the fundamental things are the&nbsp;same.   This is the longest post I've ever posted.&nbsp;Hope I can&nbsp;write posts as long as this one in the future.&nbsp;

      While I was having the best sleep within this month&nbsp; last night, a thunder spoiled my sleep. The thunder was so loud that it sounded like somebody shouting at my ears. I woke up immediately and my heartbeat rate increased. I felt a little bit nervous so I could not sleep&nbsp;again. And the lightning stopped&nbsp;me from trying to sleep again!&nbsp;But finally I fell asleep after the disapperance of thunder and lightning. This morning I felt I've lost all my energy. I hate thunder!  &nbsp;  Since I did not have a good sleep last night, I cannot figure out what&nbsp;is in my mind. So I need to rearrange data in my brain... &nbsp; P. S. This is the first time I was scared by thunder since childhood. I know it is somehow embarrassing, but it is quite a special experience for me.

      The previous two days I kept doing one thing, sorting. I read some web pages talking about two sorting algorithms quicksort and mergesort. I've learnt quicksort, so I put my concentration my mergesort. Mergesort isn't very difficult, and the critical step is the merging procedure. I've used plenty of time to write the merge function. Although the program listing of mergesort is longer than that of quicksort, mergesort is easier to understand and more intuitive. &nbsp; I've read my friend, puzzu's blog before writing this post. He wrote his blog well, which&nbsp;shares his daily life and feelings. I think&nbsp;this style is the best style&nbsp;for a teenager's blog. &nbsp;  Well, you may think that my blog is very boring, in fact it is. Since the writer of this blog is a boring person, too. I'll try to write less boring posts with all my effort.

      Haven't write the blog for a few days since I don't know what to write.  Today I've talked to my friends through ICQ. We start to get worried as the day&nbsp;of the release of HKCEE result is approaching. I won't probably see new friends in F.5 again in September. When I was in the first month of being 4E member, I didn't feel good as the classmates are naughty. Now I appreciated them, they really made the atmosphere in the class well. I enjoyed being with them since they are funny. I felt a little bit sad when I realized we are going to seperate.  This is the last week of July. My long holiday have passed for over a half. I had done nothing meaningful in the holiday. But I think I'll try hard to do more meaningful things from now on.

       The day for the release of HKCEE result is coming soon. I have confidence to get enough marks to study F.6. In my school, the F.6 subjects choices are: Physics, Biology/Pure Mathematics, Chemistry/Computer Studies. As I'm very weak and have no interest in biology, I'll definitely choose Pure Mathematics. And I'll also choose Computer Studies since&nbsp;I love this subject very much. If unluckily I have to study F.6 in another school, I won't feel frustrated to study Chemistry as I also like Chemistry.  Heard from&nbsp;some F.6 students, A-level syllabus is very demanding and much harder than CE. So I think I need to work hard and revise every day. This summer I've been lazy enough, and I'll work hard in F.6!

       Computer programming is a very interesting to do. Learning a programming language requires some time, but it worths. The major problem of learning to program is not the language itself, but the technologies needed to learn in order to write useful programs. For example, just XML consists of plenty of technologies, such as XSLT, XML Schema, XQuery, XPath... These names make me feel dizzy. And it is not very possible to learn them all since they expand as time goes by.  However, the truth is as a programmer, you need to know the major computer technologies to be competitive. So, treating programming as a hobby is good. Treating it as a job is not as good as many people think.

       SQL stand for Structured Query Language. It is the most common language for database manipulation. SQL has an intuitive syntax, which is very easy to learn. Also, SQL is so powerful that every database task can be done using it. As All major databases support SQL,&nbsp;knowing it can allow you work with different databases.  As a coding novice, I'm learning SQL too. The four basic statements, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, are very easy&nbsp;to master. Now I am able to do basic database tasks such as retrieving database table records or inserting new row into a table.  Just use SQL itself isn't very interesting. But when SQL is combined with&nbsp;server-side programming technologies&nbsp;such as PHP, ASP.NET, it becomes a powerful tool for web applications development. So any programmer should at least know the basics of SQL.  By the way, my polling system is finally complete. Although a large amount of time is spent on testing stored procedures, the development process is still&nbsp;smooth. Now I have a complete polling&nbsp;components, and&nbsp;I can use it on my web site. But unfortunately&nbsp;ASP.NET 2.0&nbsp;is still in beta stage, I&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;publish my web site. I hope my web site can be hosted&nbsp;by next year, after the public release of&nbsp;ASP.NET 2.0&nbsp;full version.

       Today I still had nothing to do, so I decided to write a polling web page using ASP.NET. I read an article from MSDN talking about creating a simple polling system. After I understood how the database should be structured, I started to create a web user control that show options for polling. The coding process was very successful, and also I learned how to write stored procedures for Microsoft SQL Server.  After two hours of development, My voting control was finally finished. But during testing, it could not show the title of the poll. At first I thought it was the problem was the stored procedure. So I amended the stored procedure and even the database tables but it didn't help. I failed to figure out what the error was after spending a few hours.  I returned to track the program after lunch. I found that the value of SqlParameter object for the poll title is empty all the time and I did not know why. Then I read through the documentation about SqlCommand and some examples. And at last I found the error! It was a mistake to get the value for an output SqlParameter before the SqlDataReader was closed. The value of it is set after closing the SqlDataReader. So I corrected this mistake and test the web page and it worked fine!  This is the first time I write something useful. From the process I discovered the fun of programming and the difficulties of debugging. Also, I found that I'm not very familiar with ASP.NET. I think I need work harder to learn it. Tomorrow I hope I will be able to finish the whole polling system.

       Yesterday was HKCEE result release day, the most important day for every F.5 students. I woke up at 7:15 and prepared anything and left home at 7:45. I arrived school at about 7:50 and found there was only few F.5 student there. So I decided to&nbsp;go to room 110 to have a seat and relax.  At about 8:00, some 5E students came back. They were not very nervous and talked and made jokes as usual. After 15 minutes, my friends Rossi and John came into the room. I talked with John and he was expecting to get 21 or 22 marks.  At 8:35, the most important time came. Our class teacher, Mr. Yung came into the room with the HKCEE result notices. He delivered the result notices according to last number. As I'm number 28, I received the result the notice at a quite late time. I could see when the classmates received their notices, some showed happiness, some felt amazed and some cried. When I received my notice, I first read the Best 6 mark at the bottom. Surprisingly, I got 29 marks! It was much higher than what I expected. Then I read grade by grade and I got 5A3B, a very good result. When Rossi and John received their notices, they felt frustrated since they didn't get enough mark to study F.6 in STMGSS. Then, Mr Yung started delivering STMGSS F.6 admission form. We took the forms and filled it. I chose to study Pure Mathematics and Computer Studies. And we went to submit the forms in the next room at about 9:00.  The F.6 class list would not release until 11:00. So John, Rossi and me started to talk about which schools they were going to apply for. After a few minutes talk, Rossi decided to take a school in Shan King but John decided yet.  As I had nothing to do during the waiting time, I went to other classes and asked others how many marks they got. All my friends had got very good marks, from 24 to 30. At about 10:00, I went downstairs to the ground floor to wait for the admission result.  After waiting for a long time, at 11:10, the result for science class admission was released. Most of my friends and me were admitted. But John and Rossi needed to find other schools. So they took the Joint Admission forms and left. I went upstairs to room 111 to do the admission procedures. At 12:15, all procedures were completed and I left the school.  In the afternoon, Dad and I went to buy books. I had bought most of the books. But when I checked the books at home,&nbsp;I found that the salesman gave me the wrong version of Pure Mathematics textbooks. So I need to replace them today. How bothersome!

       Today I've gone to my school to attend a talk about HKCEE result release. This talk was useful, I knew the procedure for applying F.6 now, and I got many guides. Tonight I'll read them all to confirm what should do at 11/8, the day of HKCEE result release.  There are many things need to prepare, such as photos, result notices of F.4 and F.5 and photocopies of them. These two days will be very busy!
