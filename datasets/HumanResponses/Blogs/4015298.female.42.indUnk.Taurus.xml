						     Ok, well I hope to be better about posting to this than I seem to have been following through a great many other things in my life.     &nbsp;

						     After months of wondering exactly what the heck a BLOG was, I came across&nbsp;one by a young man from Dallas, TX that explained it - and I was HOOKED!!     &nbsp;

						    Wow - time really flies whether you're having fun or not. It's been quite a while (over a week, in fact) since I actually made it here to put some words down on, er - what exactly is this?? It's not paper - and it's not even necessarily in black and white - so I don't know quite what to call it. Cyber-perpetuity? (is perpetuity spelled correctly? I suppose I'll have to check now to see.)  Any-hoo, back to my dilemma. For a week or so now, every time I MADE myself find the time to come out here put down something for someone somewhere to read, I got sidetracked. I supposed I could blame it (initally) on Jen and Paula - or maybe on blogger itself - for listing soooo many other more interesting blogs to look at!  I have read so far about everything from the x-rated antics of an oversexed exec and his barely-legal office assistant to logs about a professional massage "therapist" who offers to see her clients through to "completion" to a typical Chinese college student's life and experiences with her boyfriend and an assorted cast (this was quite interesting as it was written in English - perhaps because the UK still holds Hong Kong, or used to, whichever). I also have read some very interesting commentaries by several conservative political pundits - which I found particularly interesting and which kept me busy for a couple of hours as I clicked on link after link after link, getting myself deeper and deeper into the chain of blogs. I read one blog by a young girl whose birthday is the same day as my oldest daughter - maybe a couple of years earlier - so I read it simply for that reason. She talked about college life and piercings and tattoos and which of her friends were sleeping with the others also. Let's see... oh YES - there is the continuing saga of the california bar bouncer and company - quite amusing.  Most of these well put-together cyber journals makes me wonder why I even bother attempting to entertain myself - let alone anyone else - with my own rants and raves. But then again, I only started this thing for the sole purpose of bashing a certain scum sucking sewer rat and exorcising a few of my own demons.  Maybe I should just have another piece of cake and a glass of milk and call it a night - right now I'm much more in the mood to read about Kashmir's travels in the Peruvian rain forest than to pour out my guts or worry about correct use of grammar and punctuation.  I do have a few ideas for future posts, so I'm making a list here - in case I forget:  1) reconnecting with old high school friends/classmates  2) why I'm ready for my 20 y/o daughter to get out from under my house and out on her own  3) why so many men are homophobic and yet - they all seem to have a fascination with trying to convince a woman to try anal sex (ok - just threw this one in to see if you were still awake)  4) my ex-husband, the moron and his slutty sidekick I call my stepwife  5) funny resume blunders I've actually read first-hand (this one should be put into book form, published, and make me a rich woman)  6) people who drive down the e-way in the left hand lane - but not going faster than the right hand lane - as if they consider themselves the official pacecar of the canyon e-way  7) why i'm a selfish horrible person and I know it, but can't seem to help myself  8) are there ANY good men left out there who can appreciate me - oh hell - are there any good men out there, period????  later.... osm

						     Ok here - here I sit bawling - I'm supposed to be working, and I have been - with the radio playing country music in the background. There was a PLAIN and simple reason why I gave up Country Music after I separated and then divorced - it just freakin' depresses the HELL out of me!! But my oldest daughter likes it, and some of the stuff today is really good, so lately I've found myself listening to it more and more - BIG MISTAKE.  And now, as I sit here sorting through resumes and making my daily calls to hiring managers and candidates, in my subconscious I hear the words to a song by Gary Allan come pouring out over the air waves. It's a song about a daddy's love for his little girl - I believe it's entitled "Tough Little Boys". It's all about how this grown man is turned all to mush watching his little girl grow and change - and all the inevitible emotional tugs there will be - watching her take her first steps, go off to school, get married, etc....  Which brings me to the cause of my tears. My own little angel lies sleeping in her bed - my GOD she is beautiful - with her golden blonde hair, but dark, dark THICK eyelashes laying on porcelain skin. Just as beautiful when she's awake, because she has eyes of the BLUEST, truest BLUE you've ever seen - not sky blue, and not dark - just brilliant BLUE. Anyway - this song makes me so painfully aware that my baby's father goes about his daily routine without even sparing a thought for her existence, let along her well-being - and certainly she will never hear him say how he watched in with the most thrilling trepidation as she took her first steps, or how he cried like a baby and followed her school bus all the way into town on her first day of school, or how he knows some day he'll have to give her away - he's already done that. He did it the night we made her. He did it the minute he told me he loved me and wanted to live with me forever - with the first lie that came from his lips. It makes me want to pick up the phone and call Mr. Randy Brison (see, I made it almost a whole month before I actually used his name - hence the tootsie pop reference) and tell him what a pathetic person he is - and how I ALMOST feel sorry for him.  She is awake now; I can hear her over the baby monitor - lying in her bed, singing a song that only a two-year-old can compose. She is precious. She holds the world in her tiny little hands - it is hers to hold fast or to throw away. Anything is possible for her - except her father's love. I hate him for that. Fuck him. What a loser - who could do this to their own child?? I don't mind that he changed his mind about wanting me - I'm a big girl, I'll get over it. How will she?  She already has used the word "dad" to mean ANY person of the male persuasion, not knowing that it is supposed to be reserved for the male person who, if he didn't donate the dna to create you at least cares more about you than any other in the world and would die so that you might live. Don't get me wrong - I know there are LOTS of dads who suck - my ex-husband has let my older kids down so many times it is unreal, but at least they KNEW who he was. At least he managed to have a few bright and shining moments - and has wanted to know about them and hug them and tell them he loved them. It's a different kind of pain when they at least KNOW what "dad" is supposed to mean than it is when trying to explain to a child that "dad" isn't just a random word. It is supposed to have purpose and meaning - and a face to see yourself in, and arms to pick you up and hold you, and lips to kiss away your fears/tears/boo-boos.  AAARRRRGGGGHHHH - these are the days when I wonder how stupid I really am. How could I have thought it would be fair to her to bring her into this world and to keep her myself??? And yet - anything else would just not have been an option for me. Which is the bottom line - she is for me. I wanted her. I needed her. Far more than she will ever need me - I hope that doesn't become a weight around her neck. I will have to work very hard to let her be her and to live her life without worrying who's going to be there for Mom.  Like I said - I'm a big girl, I can take it. I just wish my little girl had a daddy - HER daddy - and in a moment of true weakness - I wish he had her, too because he's the one who's really missing out.... osm

						     I just read a post on another blog -   urlLink  http://ridor.blogspot.com/    . The post was entitled "I Have No Right To Tell Them How To Live Their Lives!" I actually wrote this post as a comment, but it turned out so long, I couldn't post it there (they have a 1000 word limit). So, I just said I enjoyed the comments and left my URL. So, without further comment - here is what I wrote:

						     I have no idea what I'm going to write about today. I just know that I haven't been here in a whole week and I probably should write something.
