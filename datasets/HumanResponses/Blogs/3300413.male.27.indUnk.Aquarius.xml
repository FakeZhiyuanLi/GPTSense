      I should have been born a cat, for all my familial instincts..  But still this doesn't answer the reason why I am always at the receiving end of the wrath which erupts like a volcano once I tell a close buddy "NO I wont give a farewell party". Most of the time the reciever takes it in the offensive. With the look of an wounded tiger he would revert, "Who asked u to pay the tab?".  But buddy, thing is that I hate being in a farewell party . I just hate it!! Just like one hates attending a party on somebodies amputed leg-especially if it is your own-.    My hatred for farewell parties began long back. When my seniors in the boarding house was about to complete their 10th we decided to give them a party. We decided to stroll down to a nearby beach side fort for the occassion.Inside the fort we sat down in an arc basked by the golden rays of sun.    I was in my usual attire. Half shorts, un-ironed shirt and an unkempt hair. When the role of the comperer for the show was thrusted upon me as usual, I slipped on to it like a duck into water.   Like an old pro I strolled in. But.. Some thing suddenly struck me. I started pouring all over with the frenzy of a flood with manic road rage, which just ripped open a Hirakud. I sobbed unconsolably, while the others around gathered around and consoled me. That was the best compering I have ever done. People around thought the show was a big success after my torrential downpour!!! Every one else were happy and content expect me.   I felt like a sissy.. With the sadness of somebody who lost his manhood, which he patiently groomed for a decade and a half, I decided farewells are not mine..

      When I was sent to Hyderabad on my first job my feeling was akin to getting sentenced to guillotine. But after spending my 8 months in Hyderabad I would definitely vouch Hyderabad not bad.    Food:   In my first day in office I found that my boss is at least thrice my width and together we can cramp into an auto. By the time I left Hyderabad auto drivers had already started refusing normal meter charge for two of us. A casual observation around the office around this time made me realize this city is full of pregnant men and I am fast becoming one!!!    Hyderabad is more than Biriyani.., Its a mélange of mexican, egyptian, iraqi, continental, chinese , thai , peshawari and all Indian regions from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.    Mallu from Moon  On my third month in Hyderabad I was surprised to find that the Malayali who had earlier ran teashops in Everest and in Moon is now settled down in Minerva Circle, Hyderabad. His little mobile teashop selling porottas, fish fries and chicken in various form of undress had long queues of salivating admirers. Grapevine says he married of his daughter in a nearby three star hotel where Prime Minister stayed on his visit to Hyderabad.   Paradise  First time I called my parents and told them that I am calling from paradise they got startled. With a history spanning 50 years and a permanent place in the Hyderabad Map Paradise is etched deep into Hyderabad's history. This should be the most famous eatery in Hyderabad and it caters to more than 500 people, for sure, in various restaurants cramped into it.   Our favorite hangout in Paradise was the open-air restaurant, which looked like Tarzan's tree house.  Besides the tree house Paradise has recently opened a very big new restaurant in the annexure, which looks very natty in its elegant decor. But the fact is how many ever they increase their seating capacities the crowd still teems inside like fruit-flies on jackfruit and one still have to wait for their seat. Paradise is the only place where I have ever witnessed my eating partners picking up fights with the waiters for the excessive quantity of food. Although multi-cuisine restaurant, Paradise is more famous for its yummy Biriyani. Any party in our guesthouse, or any of the other Secunderabad guesthouses perhaps, would never be complete without the takeaway food from here.   Bottle’s & Chimney’s  On a working day there is nothing better than B&C. One has to just roll up the sleeves, sprawl on the black leather couches, order the pub lunch and indulge. Pick your platter from a selection of Mexican, Chinese, Thai, Tandoori and continental. It comes with a glass of beer and has a scoop of ice cream for the dessert all for 100 bucks. This is heaven!!! Food here is amazing, ambience the best and couch divine.   Chutney's   In Nagarjuna Circle nobody would go any further than Chutney’s for a bite. Chutney’s serve tasty south Indian food and has a range of tasty Dosa’s on their Menu. The first thing which caught my attention in Chutney’s were their novel table mats, which were paper with cartoons and puzzle to keep you occupied till the steamy dosa’s reach you. Recently Chutneys have started a buffet counter, which gives you a stomach full at an affordable price.    Taj Residency:   Of late I’ve heard somebody telling me that they have hiked their dinner buffet prices. It doesn’t amaze me after our exploits in this place. When we were there we ate like there is no tomorrow. The four hundred (approx.) we paid in this place we thought was our license to an eating competition. Led by my boss we started with hot from tandoor along with the pitcher of beer we have ordered. Soon we found out nirvana is elsewhere. We bee lined from table to table like a mad emperor on his rampaging conquest. I don’t remember any one even mentioning staple. We were piling our plates with starters and salads, whose name we never cared to read.   At eleven thirty when the last servings had to be taken we decided to forget our beer and race for the desserts. Pies, tarts, cakes, icecreams, jamuns, rosagollas and other stuff. Only problem and the end was that we were too stuffed to eat all fruits of our conquest. After much thought on this mortal dilemma we arrived at the solution. We are gonna pack them in napkins and smuggle out for tomorrow.   Fusion 9   Fusion 9 is more of a lounge bar with soft music and fusion cuisine. The reason I can never forget Fusion 9 lies more in the 6 pebbles, which are laid in my room.  It was my first party in Hyderabad after clinching my first major deal.  Within the sales team we were used to have frequent parties for reasons unlimited, which kept on pouring in. But this was the day when they took notice of the fact that one guy in all the parties, was sitting down and gulping down cocktails after cocktail at their expenses. That was I.  They decided to honor me on this day and for five of us the bill ran to six thousand compelling me to sneak 6 pebbles out of Fusion 9 as a souvenir against cocktail all abuses. Any way the guys were kind enough on me by deciding not to have their dinner.  Fusion 9 has great ambience and tasty food. But quantity of food is on the lower side and prices especially of (sob) cocktails to the higher side.    Galloping Gooseberries:  Egyptian , Greek and other stuff . I Cant remember the name of what I ate too. But the food was tasty.    Pickles:   Pickles , the 24 hours coffee shop inside Baseera, Secunderabad was our haunt after a second show. Pickles has a pleasing interior. In one corner of it was kept enumerable bottles of pickles in goddamnwhat varieties. Even at wee hours pickles had an amazing crowd teeming into the place. The midnight buffet is good and considering the time of the day value for money.   Nanking   If you want to spend a nice Saturday standing on the hot road for an invitation to enter a restaurant Nanking is the place. Nanking a Chinese restaurant serves great food but the crampy interiors and the long queues make me hesitant to call it the best option on a holiday.  Part 2: to contain Haveli, Utsav, Hyderabad House, Malgudi, Dabbas at Medchal,  Andhra Messes and Yatri Nivas and other Hyderbad Fun

      When I set foot in Club MDI, my house to be in Sant Nagar, all my housemates rejoiced. They liked my TV, front-loading washing machine and the copy of Debonair. And I liked curling down comfortably in the corner ear-marked for me, happy to be back with my old friends.  Club MDI was unique. It had people walking through all the time, some from MDI and other from distance places like Bhopal!!! We played cards, shared whatever food we had (i.e, if our Atomic Kitchen is on). Else we inmates debated on what we should order for dinner till we slept on an empty stomach.   TV soon became the vital cog of our house. It bought people from as far as Gurgaon and Noida to watch Balaji smash Akthar. We cheered, jeered and made merry. We found our biological washing machine more eco-friendly and cost effective my front-loading washing machine got degraded to a side table to keep ironed clothes. Debonair was found missing after a first week as one of our guests found his nirvana was more in it rather than in Balaji.  There were five permanent members in our Club.   One is a  Panda.  But people took him for a sloth based on the urgency and swiftness in his actions.  Apart from bamboo shoots we had a shared passion for food. He hailed from Orissa and reveled in his double meaning jibes.  Next is a Tiger  JK . A very ferocious looking animal from Kerala. His looks earned his the sobriquet “TheRapist” within our campus walls. His deadly look will get negated and fear factor vaporized, as you know him. He is a ‘philosopher vegetable’ who likes to spend his time horizontally on bed staring, at the ceiling. No harm can come your way unless you block his perspective.   Vijay . He is the most sensible and studious amongst us. Moreover he had a company given Maruti 800. He and me were the two long distance ala truck drivers who made our outbound trips memorable. He got his kick of his life when we conferred him the title Vijay Schumacher after we won the race against Toyota Corolla on the Jaipur Highway. But he too is an MBA and a true partner for us in ideating without moving a finger.  The last is  Doctor . He belongs to the rare category of an MBA, MBBS and was not from MDI. He was the only hope of our house. He bought vegetable and ran our home.   Dekh Paseena’s Atomic Kitchen  The plumb lady, looked more like a traveling circus in her colorful attire. She came along with an entourage of mangy children with running noses, who settled in front of our TV forcing us to watch BBC with the misplaced hope that they will leave sooner. Paseena is a mystery for us just like the mystery of missing kitchen containers when she got fired once FIVE MBAs reached a consensus.  Half the time she didn’t come to cook and in the other half we prayed she wont so that we can have better food from outside. Whenever she came she had a sob story and wept for forgiveness for those time she didn’t come. We knew she couldn’t come since her daughter or husband is unwell or her in-laws passed away. With the kind of food she made we could actually empathized with her family and were very sympathetic to their misery!!!   Every time when it was time for her to leave after a cooking expedition she came to one of us who is nearest to the door and lowered her blouse with a sudden dramatic flourish with a comment “ Dekh Paseena” to announce her ultimate sacrifice in out hot kitchen furnace all for keeping us well fed. We soon composed a remix album for her love with a title “Dekh Paseena Dekh-Remix-Part II” with plenty of guitar and drums.   Dilli Hatt, Gurgaon Malls, Andhra Bhavan and Movies   Weekends in Delhi were never shot of events. Our club was often the hotspot for many an activity. The irrational exuberance in us got its highs when fifteen of us met in the Gurgaon malls sharing popcorns, eye-candies, movies and beer. But nothing could have beaten Dilli Hat when we celebrated our plurality on its food courts. We took Mizorom bamboo shoots, Laksha Dweep Fish Curries, Kerala appams, Nagaland Momos , Rajasthani Thali , Bihari Matka, Maharatra Pav Bhaji and sat in front of Sikkim stall with fruit beers in Hand.   Shakunthalam in Pragathi Maidan also stood out as a destination for our hangouts with the nearby green water’s of moat around Purana Qila adding a mystic charm to it.  This place has an amazing effect on you when you absorb the fact you are experiencing all this serenity and calm in the middle of Delhi!!!  We backed up some of this trip with a visit to Andhra Bhavan when the plurality hogged the richness of Andhra cuisine. Hot and Spicy!!!   Kasauli and Jaipur   It all started over King Fisher Cans on a Friday mid-night. After a round of KF some one amongst us said, “lets go”.  Suddenly all of us realized it’s the time for a trip. The tiger sprang up and reminded us that for all his laziness his week starts on Friday and he need to be back by four’o’ clock next day. We agreed to comply and started for Kasauli, which is 350 kms in Himachal Pradesh. Thus started a new genre of adventure.  We reached back from Kausali one’o’ clock on Saturday night driving more than 30 kms every hour on an average. All what we did in Kasauli was to sleep. On this trip, to our credit we became the first bunch of jokers who saw rock garden from back to front in moonlight without paying- the fruit of a tough convincing act at the gates because entry time was long over. Still the trip was memorable for its sheer madness and the fun, inside our car, at the dhabbas and on the road.  Jaipur also came quick. Another midnight of another weekend we decided to hit the tarmac. This time we didn’t had to take any hotel to sleep as one of our friends played the host. Although little hot Jaipur was also full of fun & beer!!!   Simulated Hill Station and The Terror in our Kitchen  Finally we found an anti dote to scorching Delhi. We rented an air conditioner and simulated a Hill station inside our house. All the animals of Club MDI crisscrossed their beds across our air-conditioned den. It looked more like an arena for Congress parliamentary party meeting.   Then the sudden winds of change flew through our Kitchen. Our housemaid took over our stoves through a kitchen coup. Her cooking was nothing amazing but very much edible. She coerced us to eat as if we were small school kid refusing to eat. She kept on scolding us on the top of her voice for being bad children. But with all the noise pollution she is still our heroine.  The deadly combination of good food and cool air did wonders to the Club MDI. In the first weekend after our new setup got ready, I was in bed for 50 hours out of 60 hours I had. The other 10 hours went for drinking beer and eating food.  Cards and Snake and Ladder games kept us engaged whenever our eyes were open.

      I’m fast progressing in my effort to provide effortless non-sense.. Do rip me apart and inject some sense in me so that u can motivate me to stop!!!    Editorial*  This blog is meant to be interesting, as interesting as a dead mouse in your front office desk.  I want people to talk about it. But sadly, after a rethought I found to my uneasiness that any interesting website requires lots of content.  This dilemma led me to my guru, aspiration and philosopher, a guy who spent half his time horizontally looking up at the ceiling doing nothing. He gave me this advice “Beg, Borrow or Steal”.    Parental Guidance:  This website will contain heavily retarded logic and ideas. These are inseparable part of the editor’s upbringing. He is known to be very special and gifted.   * This section is for people who are paranoid about having noodles inside their helmets.    Quixote Rules!!!   “However big the fool, there is always a bigger fool to admire him”. -- Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux  The above sums the reason for this website, as well as the reason for my admiration for Uncle Nicolas.  Apart from it there is another compelling reason, which made me, take this desperate step. There is a special no prize for the right guesses, still I would request you to send your choice to your own e-mail addresses.  a)	 A Trap wide Open:  My earlier Boss used to educate me on the importance of keeping my trap shut. He used to quote some Tamil proverb on a frog’s death and superimpose my destiny on to it. Still I can’t resist my temptation to croak, nag, and brag.  b)	  A tribute to the strategist : This website is a tribute to all armchair strategists, especially the most virile MBA variants of them. It is too much of a work for all of us to stay vertical from our thinking pads and put our noble ideas together. c)	 An understanding Organization:  After eight months of hard work in the organization my employer’s became clear of my value add -as clear as a gold fish to a cat-. They decided to extract the maximum out of me by giving me a nice place to sit, requesting not to meddle with any thing important.   Work  I had to apply for work once my parents made clear that they are taking out my life support system. Unwillingly I appeared for my campus’ placement and got sucked to a whole new eco-system. While still clueless of my survival in the land of Brontosaurus my Boss called me for a man-to-man drink.  Drunk to his nose he made the mistake of telling me about the elixir of corporate success. It come in the book form and had insight, which I am sure trash like “7 habits” will never have. It was Dilbert Omnibus.  Flipping through the pages I started to understand the corporate world, could better use my management skills and understood that my boss has a pointy-head. This made me fit into the organization like a blue whale to a blue socks.    Adventures on a Mouse Pad   So far I have never heard of any one abusing a mouse by dragging its tail to a cubicle. Factually a Pigsty or a mouse pad is always a better place than a cubicle. Hence no self-respecting mouse, which is biologically fit, would have ever sneaked into a cubicle. But still apart from providing air-conditioning in summer and clean rest rooms when there is no water in my house, the cubicle has done many things to me.  1.	 Coffee Drinking Machine :  The evolution within my monkey cage has metamorphosed me to a Coffee Drinking Machine. Due to acute boredom inside the cage, which is devoid of any casual zoo goers and abound with zookeepers, I became a bottomless coffee drinking machine.  2.	 Rickety cricket : Cricket always reminds one of balls, which one usually distributes equally between your employers and other pestering mosquitoes-Like the landlady who asks for rent every month.  But a rickety cricket is what my colleagues and I are during the office lunch break. Together we make such soothing noises, which can put any naked cricket to utter disgrace (shame). Most of the noises in our Jugalbandi revolves around the latest HR initiatives for improving the employee morale-like asking you to hop from your chair to printer like a lame penguin in Antarctica winter (that should be fun, though I have never seen one)-.  3.	 Praying Mantis : Those times we are not crickets during the lunch breaks, we become Praying Mantises which dissolve into its natural habitat watch and admire other superior creatures of evolution. (After reading the below trivia I couldn’t help wondering about my choice of animals ”The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is attached to its body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head off’, BHhaaaMMM!!!) 4.	 Animal Rights Activist : After my attack on all the above said animals I couldn’t help putting myself in the shoes of this particular animal. For your understanding I am also an avid nature lover. And I like them fried with a few drops of lemon and some fresh onions sprinkled on top.

       To Jump or not to Jump     Hyderabadi Honey Moon    When I was still in Hyderabad at the 8th month of my job I was still a satisfied employee. I was happy with the way things turned around for me. After the initial head slamming and intermittent self-doubts I was happy with state I was. I had adjusted to my boss after our initial incompatibility adjustments; I had sufficient luck to exceed my numbers to keep the bean counters happy and had developed enough confidence with my colleagues to earn their respect.  My world in Hyderabad was small. Entering office at nine in the office and leaving for home at eight won’t allow you to make friends in a new city. And a sales office in a regional office always lacked more than a hand few people who shared your age and your choices. This smallness of the world kept me happy. I was more like the proverbial frog in the well. My blinkers made me blind to what others of my elk are doing.   All for the greater good  One good day I came to know that Valhalla is calling me. The first thought, which came to my mind, was the elation of being among the chosen lot. Soon it evaporated into despair of the reality. The whole exercise was a re-shuffle as they thought the regions could survive with out us. My Hyderabad bosses wanted me to be there but Valhalla differed. They said that our need in the heavens are imminent. They want me to fly down next day!!!  The first week in the corporate was hectic. Long hours were really long and there were too many things to be done. One day we were re-viewing the strategy for the company along with the CEO and the next day we were reviewing the regions!!! After two weeks of heightened orgasmic activities suddenly the viagara started to wane off.   Next task for us was to work of a marketing plan & profile for the company under the COO. This was a complete water shed. Under a COO, who was all at sea about the outcomes he needed and who didnt have time or ear to devout to the 'proposed task' we were in for a holiday.  Then came the next revelation. I have to go Bangalore back in sales and the three other buddies of mine who were also culled out from region will stay back as product managers.    The beauty and the beast   This new revelation indeed was a shock to me. In hindsight I already what I was doing in sales is no job which I want to do for life. The HO assignment was a rope of hope which would have allowed me to go to a postion of my preference.   Why do I hate sales? This is a question I tried to answer my self. NO I didnt hate sales in Hyderabad. Infacr I'd started enjoying it Hyderabad. But doing it for life is not doing justice to me. I consider myself good in understanding and ideating on technology. Sales doesn't offer any scope for that. The task cutout in sales is more for mundane tasks like haggling for the money and trying to build relationship all for a different motive. May be Sales would have made me a better administrator. But I don't think that is a niche I am keen on. I am good with ideas and intitation.     Bangalore   In a month in Bangalore I have an idea of what is in it for me. The segement I hace been assigned looks like a non-starter with most of the competitors already gobbling up multi-year contracts. The attractiveness of learning this new segment was the only postive for me to take up the Bangalore job.   Yes I'll get a new vertical or new assortment of customers to look at since the company would be keen to utilize me to the hilt    So what next??   Jump or not to jump  I often get drowned in this question. My inertia for a job hunt is pegging me down. More than that is my worry of what a good job for me is. Analyst, pre-sales, consultant?? What do all of them do.  But my organisation is slow poison. As one of the senior colleagues have told me a job in sales with a dejected mind wont help. I can already feel that. And the people policies in the company never cease to amuse me!!!

      New Office  The holidays are over. Remininscenes of home sweet home, is now more of a baggage.    Even though you are in the same company, a new office is a new office. Every thing around is new to you. There is a culture shock. The fact that I know half the people by person or by names made it more intriguing. This meant nobody took me around and introduced me to the rest of the office. So I am left with a lot of nameless faces. We exchanged smiles, smiles with no names. Now I find it awkward to ask their name. I keep forgetting those I learned. They have only one name to remember- that too all of three alphabets- but not for me.  I was not amused when I found there is no computer or chair for me.  I never expected it.  The company, which boasts about process excellence never, had any of it. But lucky(?) for me a collegaue, a senior of mine in the campus, is quitting the company. So, once he leaves I can use his PC. (I couldn’t help wonder that would have happened otherwise). Now I’m multiplexing between all the unused computers. Shamelessly raiding them wheneer their owner move out.   Job  When you look at a forest from a glider you know how it is shaped. You know where the stream is lying and you know where the cliff is dangling. But now I see only woods. Woods, dark and thick.  The ideas you have need to be converted into tangible steps that can be monitored and measured.  One feels helpless and lost. In sales longterm is a week. Unless you have results in a jiffy you will have a sickle on your neck.    The worst part is that most of the things you need to do in the beginning are intangibles. Then there are dumb-ass rules set by the organisation. It has set a minimum number of calls-2 calls a day-, which I need to take in a month.  This is the bane of the organisation. Although it blazons from the rooftop about the need to put brains into your job thsese kind of guidelines ensures you will not.  Life after work  Soon after I came back from Kerala I shifted along with my friends to Indiranagar. This costs me a fortune but I think the area is worth the bounty. Indira Nagar is one of the better and costliest locatlities. Yet, it still possesses the Old World charm of Bangalore. It teems with maintained parks. And is a quite residential area with independed houses arbored by huge, old trees. I like the fact that unlike delhi it invites me to take a walk around absorbing its refreshing aura.   Three of us stays in our second floor house. My room is spacious and has an attached toilet with a bathing tub. I would have much preferred a shower instead. There is nothing more rejevunating after a tough day more than a good shower bath with lukewarm water.   The Guy who busted me  Sometimes I hate this chap. He all of six months robbed me from my stature as the youngest in the family!!! I am talking about my sister’s kid ..Tom.  My sister stays 4km away from my place. Every day after work I goes to her place for dinner, more to see Tom. The last time I saw him, he was two big and earnest eyes from a bundle of sheets. Now he is more human.  I like buying toys for him. Those toys that I like ;) , like the steamer with Mickey on it as it driver, or the melodious tweety bird. This guy is a charmer. When he opens his little mouth and gives you a smile you feel rewarded.   What next!!!  Bangalore, As I see it, has a glut of jobs in IT. But I’vnt still started making a resume. May be I am too lazy.   The biggest concern for me on a job shift is whehter I will be making a right career move. I don’t know those other jobs. I don’t want to jump from frying pan to fire. Knowing me I want to slow down, rather than making another impulsive decision based on my current badblood  with my employers.  I am confused. As confused as I always had been. Unable to take any decision. But I surely will prepare a resume soon. Let me also test waters with my new job. The fact is that I lack heart now. The raw enthusiasm required to make any foray is found missing in me. I know this is dangerous. Having your legs in two boats will only drown you.   The escapist in me bought a packet of A4 sheets and lots of pencils. It tells me it’s a long time since I’ve drawn something. Another new experiment begins.

       Last of Delhi   Last one week in Delhi was completely crazy. Parties and treats strewn over brunch, lunch, coffee, dinner and midnight had left me totally zapped. I was coughing non-stop like a clucking hen, spitting phlegm the size of gooseberries. I had an upset stomach by the eve of my journey and I puked like an obnoxious whale. The doctor in my house was very unsympathetic to my cause as he knew that the antibiotics he had given me was going down along with Pepsis, slushes and icecreams. Jet airways too didn't help my cause as they lured me into butterscotch ice-creams, which I drowned down  along with a specially ordered bottle of hot mineral water on my flight to Bangalore.   Getaway time!!!   First thing I ensured on reaching Bangalore was to get my transfer leave sanctioned. This meant I can go to Kerala..., Home!!! While reclining back inside my evening bus to Payyanur I  realised that "Homeward Bound" is much more sweeter and melodious than what Simon & Garfunkel can ever sing.   Toursit buses take 8-9 hours to reach my place. They canter at a leisurely pace, traversing the Western Ghats, often flirting with the forest foliage. It was pitch dark outside. I could here the monsoon playing mystique symphonies on my window pane. Pressing my nose on to the window I managed to clear a small spot in it, but it soon went back to its dewy best. Once the sound of rains receded I decided to open the glass a bit. The eerie noises from distant crickets welcomed me.  From the place where I got down from the bus there was about 200mts to my house. Autorickshaws were there on the busstop. But I decided to walk. This is my little world, where most of the people know me. A chit-chat on the alleys is something which I was  keen on.   Home   It stood majestically amidst the greenery around it. Our little Eden is surrounded by a 5 foot granite wall, green with monsoon ferns and adorned by a tiara of multi coloured Bouganville flowers. From the the top of this wall peeped an array of trees bearing beautiful yellow flowers giggling in the wind like a gaggle of mischievous girls.  Our house is perched in the middle a plot which spanned over an acre. This is a luxury in this area which now resemble any other urban residencial colony. Slowly opening the gate I walked down the slanting approach road, which was paved in concrete with neatly trimmed philantus on either side, onto our porch.  Every time I com here the spatial incongruence of the house strikes me badly. My parents looked like mice in the manger within this five bedroom house.      Garden of Eden    I would like to call this stretch the "Garden of Eden". My dad is most unlike me. He often smothers me with his  intricate level of planning, eye for details and meticulous way of doing things. None of this I could ever imbibe.   He is a passionate farmer.That is what make this place our Eden. I can walk out onto our garden and pluck a fruit of my choice from Guava, Sappotta( Chikoo), Pineapple, Mango, Water Apple, Custard Apple, Gooseberries, Mulberries,Passion Fruits, Jackfruits,  Bananas, plantain, Pappayas and you tell me whats.   Now that my dad is slightly diabetic all these fruits are feasted by a bevy of birds. After a sumptous meal they takes a dip under our sprinklers and take time out to sing a tune or two for the host.  Daddy maintains his garden with a sense of pride. Our flower garden, complete with its aesthic landscaping, is full of anthuriums, orchids, gladiolus, crotons, cannas, cinnias, hydrangea, roses, jasmines,assorted cacti, varieties of garden palms -including traveler's palm- and umpteen other varities of garden plants whose name I never knew.    Within this Eden my parents live a life of austerity. Mostly vegetarians -A shame for a Kerala Christian- they cultivate most of their vegetables on our small patch.  The only food expense for them are rice, wheat and milk.    Looking forward I realise that this "Garden Of Eden" will soon become a thing of past. All our relatives  live at places far off. With both my parents getting retired they have nothing to do over here except waiting for us to make a homeward trip. They have already started talking about the apartment complex in Bangalore with three adjacent flats. One for them, one for my sister and one for me.    Kerala   Kerala is unique. The place where I stay in not even part of a muncipality. So at one's own risk it can be called rural!!! But Wait a sec..  In a two kilometer radius from my place there are 2 three star hotels, Six movie halls, One engineering college, One good degree college, Schools ranging from Kendriya Vidyalaya to good private schools to government schools. And places from where you can shop every thing from a car to a sunsilk sachet.   If we extend the contour to a radius of 12km this list become more impressive with super specialty hospital cum medical colleges to Asia Pacific's biggest(upcoming) Naval base.   Geographically this place is blessed with Arabian Sea, backwaters with Mangrove forests and small green hillocks on top of which one can sit on a lazy evening watching how rivers embrace the ocean , lights of distant trains slither like slippery vipers or migratory birds flocking to their distant abodes.     A Hermit called Joe   I decided that this week is all for myself. I kept my new cellphone number a closely guarded secret.  Here I am, in bliss with life. Whispering to the rains from my balcony. Many a time I saw her coming past the mountains, past the trees, whisting like a non stop train. Before it speeds past me I could hear the chatter of thousand raindrops. Once she passes me I wait for the next one,like an vigilant gatesman. This is monsoon.  I thought I will think about life, work over this break. But I am plain too lazy. Covering myself with bedspread I turn around and sleep. Or else I switch on the TV and listen to music or catch a good movie.   As I roll my fingers down my face I could feel the sharp stubbles on my face. My mum asks me why not I comb my hair.   Yawwnn.. It time for another nap.

       Logging out from the Club   When I came back home on the eve of my journey to Bangalore all my roommates were already waiting for me. They decided to take me out for a treat. All of us went to Greater Kailash Market and made ourself comfortable in a restro-bar which was still open at mid-night. My bad throat and stomach meant no beer for me. Also it meant I had to bear them having it!!  We had to start at eight in the morning to be on time for the flight. We slept till 7.45. Then all of got into Vijay's car for dropping me at the airport   Surprise at the airport   I was surprised when I found a colleague of mine, who had recently resigned from my company, waiting to board the same flight as mine. He looked relieved leaving the company and one could me the spark in his eyes as his talked about his new organisation. For the poor chaps badluck, gentleman beside him was game for exchanging his seat with me. There after till we touched down in Bangalore I kept on yapping to him non-stop,like a monsoon  on the window sill.   Bangalore never cease to surprise me. When I got out from the airport the weather was so pleasent that I felt like I'm in a hill station. Soon the newspapers told me that this is the coolest May in Bangalore in the last 50 years- , with temparature mostly in mid twenties. It was more like steroids to me.   Airdashed for the meet?   Six thirty sharp I was at hotel Chancery in Lavelle road for my alumni meet. I found only three people around. As usual with their own sense of IST people started swarming in.   My junior batch has some thirty people working in Bangalore , while the combined number of alumni from my batch and my senior batch accounted only for six!!! This talked a lot about the placements our batches had with most of the IT companies refusing to trek up north for recruting. Every second guy I met in the meet was working for a Infosys , Wipro, Oracle , HP or a Mindtree.     Donno .. for sure   Am I happy back in Bangalore?  i donno...But this city sucks me back like a turbo charged vacuum cleaner. May be I don't have an option but to stay glued.

       The title says it all…  What started, as a whimper is now a soulful loud moan!!!  I need a change!!! Want to have a re-look on myself. If I don’t do this now, I’ll have to bear it to my tombstone. It is not a problem of me not being aware of every mousetrap I repeatedly tread into. It is more of a question of me not taking a detour but walking straight into them. Then I raise a panic alarm. Jumps up and down and get killed by my own passivity.

         Out on a wild Goose Chase:     I’m up with the larks on a Saturday!!!&nbsp;   Without wasting much time I slid into a pair of new denim and got ready for the road. Hari had told me that his train from Chennai would reach the city by 11. Before that I’ve to make some grounds.   I selected my sister’s activa for the days adventure. This bike is a baby. It reminds me of a skating board. I like the balance and poise of the vehicle while surfing on the roads. It has a huge room under the seat for dumping everything from a helmet to a rider’s swollen pride.   There were butterflies in my stomach. The fear of the unknown gleamed from my eyes as turned the bike key. This is my first venture on a job hunt.   &nbsp;From a big list send to me by a friend I selected three picks for the day  ABC  Omam  Ma foi   ABC somebody told me was the best among them.&nbsp; It is in Barton Center in the MGs, which is a twenty minutes ride from Indira Nagar.   MGs is the heart of Bangalore. I consider it the shrine. Every time I’m in this city I follow its rituals to the T. Foremost amongst them is walking up and down the pavements of Brigade road and MGs at least once before you leave. In other places when people buy something new they take it to temple for the blessings. In Bangalore things are different. Here if somebody gets a new car, a new bike, a new girl or the old girl a new silicon they take it all to MGs!!!   Barton center towered over MG road. I walked into its lounge ogling at the crowd sipping hot espresso in Barista’s canopies at the entrance. ABC is in the fourth floor. The lift was not yet crowded at this time of the day.   On reaching the place I was in for the first shock of the day. There was no ABC consultants were the address led me to. Some other consultants were running their show in that nook.&nbsp; I introduced myself to the lady at its reception. She asked me for a hard copy of my resume in a total show of disdain to the digital job I probably would have sought. Thankfully she gave me an e-mail id to which I could forward my resume. I was keener on a fast retreat.   Walking back to my bike I felt my cell phone doing a gentle trance inside my jeans pocket. It was Shom. I had called him yesterday. He wanted to tell me that there were openings at Oracle in his division. The designation open was for business development associate. The fat packet and the technology content involved in the job looked sufficiently appealing to me. But in toto I would like to call it only as a glorified call center job. In this job your skills on phone to entice a faceless customer who had earlier accessed your Internet site from some remote corner in Alaska is your success.   Shom assured me that the work environment in the company was very peppy answering to my biggest worry.&nbsp; I am still unsure.&nbsp; But I decide to enter the ring. Beggars can’t be choosers.&nbsp;   My gentle surfboard starts cruising again. The next target is Ma Foi. I had seen its office on the Airport road earlier. On reaching Ma Foi I was in for my next shock for the day, the place was closed. They have a five-day week.   I rang up Hari. He told me his train still hasn’t reached Bangalore and that meant there was more time on my hand. I picked my address list from the jeans pocket again. Omam is in Indira Nagar, the place were I stay.   Shock number three was waiting for me at Omam. The place were the address led me to was Olam international and not Omam consulting. I felt like howling like a wolf. For a second I thought of crushing the list in my land.&nbsp;   My first foray into job-seeking turns a damp squib.., a non starter.&nbsp;      Drowning the Pitchers   My cell phone is ringing. Hari’s train has arrived.   The place decided for our rendezvous was Purple Haze, a pub famous for its great music. Before I parked on the kerb I could see Hari’s head towering over the entrance.&nbsp; We were the first customers for the pub. 11.30 is way too early for any pub goers..   We ordered our first pitcher of beer.&nbsp; There were lots of things to catch up. At MDI, we were considered the original idea generators, the people behind Gremlin’s-the biggest brand in the campus.   We spoke at length about e-blast, which was my baby. I had a fight with him on e-blast. As the mule headed, single-handed tyrant behind it I didn’t heed his words for dissolving my event with other events.&nbsp; That was history.   Hari is the true implementation guy. I never considered him the creative super power. But what I admire him is his drive to turn ideas into action. He is the guy organization will die for if implementation is the key. People like me will live in the lofty attics of ideas but when it comes to grease and grime, it is he.   As our conversation veered on to our jobs I found company. Hari is frustrated too. But unlike me he still haven’t reached the point of no return.  I badly need a new job!!! After four months of sagacity now I’ve reached a dead end.&nbsp; It may be hara-kiri. But still I have no choice.   In the last week my enthusiasm for the current job touched its nadir. My assigned segment for business development, Banking and Finance, was declared officially dead.&nbsp; I am now asked to scour Services and Manufacturing verticals for my half a crore profit target. Bangalore had managed to add only two major accounts in last one year. I am the superman again. I will have to add 8 new accounts to achieve my target- going by a conservative average- in the next 11 months. I am left to start with a zero funnel. And this needs to be achieved from a vertical that is already milked for its top players. I feel like the sacrificial lamb.   My lack of interest looks pronounced to the outside world. There is no sales guy enthusiasm in my approaches. I am left feeling like snared inside a mousetrap. I had always worked on a fuel called passion In Hyderabad I had had my bad days to begin with. But there I had the resolve and will to fight back.&nbsp;   When Sunil called me to his table, it was the first time in my career I got grilled for my attitude. I was keen on a one to one, exchanging punches. But wisdom told me if I’ve to get a smooth let off that wouldn’t be the wisest thing to do. So I decided to be an earnest sub-ordinate. I got a long lecture from him about the way one has to grow in life and how one has to take things in one’s stride and battle it out. But Sunil, I am least interested in the laurels you are talking about. After seeing the life you are living “successfully” I am sure I don’t want to bend my back for those laurels.   By this time the second pitcher also got over. We went over to have our lunch. It had started to rain heavily outside.    Tryst with the Spiderman    We were not willing to let rain spoil our plans. The spider man comic we had in our hand had the address of Gotham Comics (C.A Ventures). It was time for my bike to swing back into action.   Gotham’s office was not big. At its reception was one artist taking an entrance test, sketching a character. I felt the pumping within my heart. I liked the place. I like the company of guys who sketch all the day. Recently I’ve begun to sketch strips again. Although I hate all the masked superheros in red underwear (Phantom was the only exception, may be because his unddies had no spot of red) I felt I would get some orgasms in work if I were here.   We were back to the reality by the husky voice from a bewildered receptionist  “yes sir, what can I do for you”.   Suddenly we realized we are now pouring inside Gotham’s office, bringing all the rain along with us. When we told her that we are looking for job she composed herself and guided us to another gentleman.   The day was wrong again. The right HR guys for marketing jobs were on leave. The gentleman we met gave us his visiting card and asked us to get back to the right people at the earliest.    Tata Crucible   Next adventure on cards was “Tata Crucible “,the corporate quiz compeered by ‘Pickbrain’ Giri Balasubramanyam, at it last regional round scheduled in Bangalore.&nbsp; Hari is an active quizzer who had come second in BT Acumen during our second year in MDI. He had registered his company for the quiz. I tailgated in for his missing partner.   Participating in a competitive quiz after a gap of 10 years was thrilling, especially when you have never seen something like what you are now participating in. The quiz had a written round of 20 questions to begin with.&nbsp; Mr.Pickbrain was hogging the center stage with wisecracks one after the other. The auditorium had more than 100 teams all thoroughbreds and many from across the country.   At the end of the written round we got 7 rights. I got four and Hari got three. It was not enough for us to qualify as the cut off was somewhere around 10. I felt very satisfied about my share, as it was not bad, scoring more than a national champ who sat next to me while participating in a quiz, after a decade.   Once the final round began I was happy within for not getting into the last six. Most of the questions on the stage were sixers!!! But it all ended in a major disappointment. Turning his back to us started an audience question. The whole auditorium got it wrong and there were two hands still up as the quizmaster turned around. One mine, and another of the guy sitting in front of me. At stakes was a Titan edge. I am vigorously waving my hand. But the pickbrain picked the guy in front of me and his answer was right. That was too disappointing considering around 20 people early had given wrong answers.    Remains of the Day   It was time for biking again. My roomie was going to US today. I told him I would catch up with him at the airport. It was a long drive. I could feel the cold piercing through my half sleeves.   The day was still long. After airport Hari and me caught up with another friend of ours at the MGs. By then time was around 10pm. We decided to go for another drink. Saturday evening, Bangalore was all hot and happening. We tried getting into few of the pubs. Loud music of different genre flew out of them as we opened their door. The crowd inside definitely looked global -another testament to the directions Bangalore is taking. But all the places were jam-packed with not a spot to put our foot in.   We came out and went to a restaurant suggested by our friend and hogged on to grilled chicken and planned for the next round of beer once we are back to the place we stay.

       Shrek, Lakshya and Cheaters   Shrek:  I love watching Shrek..Really, really. Even though I was watching it for the third time.  This is one genre of movie of late I'm much fond of. Animated characters, more human than human and a wacky script. I am waiting for the Ogre and Fiona revisiting me at the theaters with Shrek II  Cheaters: Interestring!!! As it was for the first time I saw a film, which stood by the cheaters. This movie depicts how a so-so school took on its mighty big competitors in the US academic decathlon competitions. An enterprising teacher, Jerry, couldn’t do much with his wards in the regional competitions but still the school managed to scraped through to the state level competition managing to grope a poor last spot. Some how, this team gets the question papers for state level championship and comes victorious by a huge margin to every ones surprise. The witch-hunt soon began and the news of leak was out in open. But Jerry and kids struck to their guns that they didn't cheat and they believed in what they did. The movie tries to empathize with Jerry and his group and succeeds in doing so…  Lakshya:  I loved this movie in patches…  First half was fun. In the second half the long, extended war scenes made it dark and gloomy. The way in which beauty & grandeur of Himalayas was depicted was exemplary, Preity as usual was gorgeous and Hritik's dilema of "Lakkshya in life" was well taken and did ring a bell.   Coconut Grove, Beer and more beer  Saturday afternoon was spent on coconut groove. Coconut grove, which is by Brigade Road, has become one of my favorite haunts in my current Bangalore stay. Aji was my partner in crime this week. Before that I’ve come here with Kumar for lunch and with Kavitha for a dinner – call the second one a hogger’s dream with bill shooting up like a chennai taximeter  -.  Coconut Grove is an ethnic Kerala Pub!!! The lunch thali here is great. It got rice sambhar, rasam, avial, koottukary, thoran, papadams etc and a fish fry and chicken curry etc for Non-vegetarian. Believe me the food is yummy! In the evening there is no thali. But that give you an excuse to jump on to appams. Appams in coconut Grove are among the best I’ve ever had. It will come hot to your plate with its majestic, crispy frills intact. Along with stew it will melt in your mouth and make you crave for more. On Saturday we started of with pitcher and by the time we finished we were so full that we could hardly getup. Our plans to go for a movie later got torpedoed as we didn’t get tickets and a call came from office to get back for some work!!! Sunday’s splurge started in the evening. First we made sure we got tickets for Lakshya. Then went on for more beer. Night was again eating out this time in a different joint   Cricket  Cricket keep coming back to my life with lot of sweet and bitter memories. It had given my enough spotlights all the time. No more league matches and other competitive tournaments. But I’m back in what I do best, opening the batting. Some how I easily find myself in this spot may be because whenever I get a chance I go on and on, putting a price to my wicket. I am enjoying my sunday morning's getting back to the game.

       Time has come for the second leg of my wild goose chase.  At 2.30p.m I have a date with a company, which is the aspiration of many an Indian IT professional.  Luckily for me my interview was scheduled at the Koramangala office of the company, saving me the trouble of traveling all the way to its sprawling campus in electronics city.  At 1p.m I started from my sister’s house after an early lunch. This week I’m staying with her, as she is alone. It is strange that after paying a king’s ransom on my rent, I end up at her place most of the time.  When I reached Koramangala at 1.30p.m. I was driving as slow as possible, listening to Radiocity. Usually I take more time even in reaching the office, which is half way down this road. May be the traffic always follows Murphy’s Law, “the later you are the heavier the traffic would be”.  I had to decide between going straight to the interview building or to goof around for some more time. I opted for the second choice. Jyothi Nivas College is just opposite to this building.  Jyothi Nivas is one of the hottest girl’s colleges in the city. The ambience around the place looked more like from Archie’s Riverdale. I could feel the purr of many a mean machine as machos bulged their biceps and went full throttle. There were funky haircuts, baggy military trousers and sleek goggles all around.  Then there were those heavenly bods. I took a vantage seat on a juice parlor facing the road where all the action happened. There were many a curvaceous butts swinging in front of me, some clad in tight denim others mounted tantalizingly on pairs of nicely cut legs sneaking out of mini slits. Their bright colored tops that floated around like butterflies were ambivalent in hiding the shapely pears within, much to the passer-by’s delight.  The dress code of the time surely is tank tops and a low waist for girls and casual Baggies and sleeveless T-Shirts for the boys. I finished my double Litchi juice as another purr whizzed past me carrying a bomb on the pillion.  Many colleges in Bangalore recently introduced dress codes for students. The eye candy I had, may be, has more to do it with it being a Saturday. I felt my deep sympathies for poor nuns and priests who run most of these campuses.  No wonder they called for a ban.  Yo Maa... wakey,  wakey.., you have an interview.  At sharp 230pm I walked in for the interview. There were two others waiting for the interview plus one middle aged man in his best suite, looking very constipated inside.  While talking to the receptionist I came to know that this office is currently used more for the interviews.  There where two three business papers, a sportsstar and a businessworld lying in small table in front of us. I slowly dug into the newspaper and went on to the Sportstar since my interview started none earlier than 3.pm.  The man who interviewed me wore an aqua marine blue check shirt. He looked badly in need of a bath and a comb. He came out to the first floor reception where I was sitting and called “Joe”. Slowly getting up and I looked at him. He extended his hand towards me “ Anil” “Hi. I’m Joe” !!!  He led me to an inside cubicle where a short serious looking person with a more formal attire joined us.  This time my introduction was better than the previous one.  “ I am some one who cartoons, blogs, treks” “I am into technology like tapeworm into a pig” “I am on the path of creative destruction” “I am the reincarnation of Lee Iaccoca” “Without me my company would have put a to-let board outside”  The guys took most of it for true and decided that I’m good enough for the HR round.  I came back to the reception.  Other two people with me were still sitting there. One of them is from GE and the other one from IBM. One had 6 years experience and the other 4. Meanwhile the gentleman in suite came out of his interview room, gave a loud thank you to the receptionist and left.  From the top floor I could see the HR person coming down like a kingfisher and deftly picking up his next prey. As the day went on his flight looked more and more labored. At 515pm he asked the receptionist how may people are left. There were three still. He called me to join him.  I saw company’s application lying on his table. I had a torrid time filling it. They scanned all data from the day you joined your KGs. And my skeletons were definitely going to come in to into.  My career graph is more like a roller coaster, which followed my flights of fantasies.  Engineering looked a definite high in my jolly ride. No body going through those sheets can comprehend the man behind it. There were sparks of brilliance and plenty of ashes of self-destruction. What would one understand from one particular marks card which showed 6 absents, 1 fail and another pass!!! And the many others that told no stories of what lay beneath the veneer.  The HR interview was becoming more of a mechanical act. The interviewer was keener on checking whether I entered all the information.  “Why didn’t you enter your nationality, By any chance you are ashamed of it? “ “Hey if you have a normal vision you should fill 6/6” “ How come your brother-in-law is in the company and you are referred by somebody else?” “ If he is US he can still forward your resume” “The salary you have suggested is very very high. I am not on a bargain but our company has some fixed standard and we can adhere to only that range. By the by, what would be the lowest salary by which you would take our offer”  Suddenly the Joe in me sprang out. Knowing well that the highest salary given for this post is Rs 5L, I bellowed   “5.25 and nothing less”  “And the bond you have. Our company has a policy that they won’t encourage breaking a bond”  “ But sir that is my personal agreement with my current employer. Sticking to it is my responsibility and I will honor it. Your company doesn’t come into picture there”  “ You have any more questions” “Nope, Nothing” “Then I will inform in you in two weeks about the results” “Okie.., that is in two weeks?” “Yes in two week” It took less that 15mts. The earlier interviews were 40-45mts long.  Driving the car back I was still brooding. “What was my fetish with the salary? I definitely would have been happy with 4.8” “ Will you join if you get the offer? Is this the job you want?”  I spent the rest of the day driving around like a restless civet.

       After a week of ‘intense’ job search it was a nice idea for me to have a retrospect. I am amazed!!! I applied only for three companies. That is the long and short of things. With a self-imposed one-month dead line for quitting my current job, I think this is big sin. This is the height of lack of imagination and I need to get things moving.  One of the three companies I had applied for called me for an interview the very next day. I managed to escape from my office by five thirty. The interview was scheduled at six at ITPL, which is outside the city limits.  Drive to ITPL through airport road is no fun. The road is narrow at places and lots of traffic keeps flowing up and down. Either side of this road one could see new apartments, many of them stylishly landscaped villas, mushrooming up. Once all of them are up and running and they starts to emit their population into this narrow strip this place will make a nice picture for an Isab gol ad.  I increased the volume of my FM radio. Radio City was playing some nice music in between the short spells of commotion from the RJ. He kept on making jingoistic statements as he kept berating Pakistan while commenting on the Pakistan-Bangladesh cricket match which was going on.  Once I reached my prospective employer I parked my car and rushed to the reception. I was late by 10 mts. Ajay Gupta, a young chap from HR, told me to make myself comfortable at the pantry while Mr. Bhat finished his current meeting. Even after I finished sipping my coffee and finished re-reading the newspaper there was no sign of Mr. Bhat. I decided to walk around the campus.  The look and feel of this campus is very homely. It was lush green with different kind of trees doting the landscape. The buildings around the campus definitely had a Kerala touch with its slopping red tile roofing. When I commented that he had a great campus Mr. Bhat’s only reaction was
