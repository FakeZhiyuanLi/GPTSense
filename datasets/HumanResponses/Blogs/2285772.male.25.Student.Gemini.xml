      What Child Is This Written by William Chatterton Dix   What child is this who laid to rest On Mary's lap is sleeping Whom angels greet with anthems sweet While shepherds watch are keeping  This, this is Christ the King Whom shepherds guard and angels sing Haste, haste to bring him laud The babe, the son of Mary  Why lies he in such mean estate Where ox and ass are feeding Good Christian fear, for sinners here The silent Word is pleading  So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh Come peasant king to own Him The King of kings, salvation brings Let loving hearts enthrone Him  This, this is Christ the King Whom shepherds guard and angels sing Haste, haste to bring him laud The babe, the son of Mary  ........................................................................................  this is by far my favorite christmas song. i melt into a wuss everytime i hear it

      just finished reading b. h. robert's  urlLink  the truth, the way, the life  . roberts was such an amazing person. although much of what he wrote is now outdated (especially the chapters dealing with science), the book was a testimony of robert's desire to find truth and his love of the gospel where he felt all truth met. it's unfortunate that the big saw no publishing while robert's was alive (or even for the next 70 years). roberts had an understanding of how the gospel encompasses all truth. he is up there with orson pratt, hugh nibley, james talmage, john widstoe, and the other great thinkers of mormonism. had his book been published, there would have likely been a growth of intellectuals sprouted by his influence (as was later the case with nibley).  although this wasn't in this book, i love this quote of roberts which well describes his feelings of the gospel and truths.  .................................................... i believe mormonism affords opportunity for disciples of the second sort; nay, that its crying need is for such disciples. it calls for thoughtful disciples who will not be content with merely repeating some of its truths, but will develop its truths; and enlarge it by that development. not half--not one-hundredth part--not a thousandth part of that which joseph smith revealed to the church has yet been unfolded, either to the church or to the world.... the prophet planted by teaching the germ-truths of the great dispensation of the fulness of times. the watering and the weeding is going on, and god is giving the increase, and will give it more abundantly in the future as more intelligent discipleship shall obtain. the disciples of mormonism, growing discontented with the necessarily primitive methods which have hitherto prevailed in sustaining the doctrine, will yet take profounder and broader views of the great doctrines committed to the church; and, departing from mere repetition, will cast them in new formulas; co-operating in the works of the spirit, until "they help to give to the truth received a more forceful expression, and carry it beyond the earlier and cruder stages of its development. ....................................................  lately i have been spoken to a lot about intellectualism and the gospel. it has been spoken of as if the two are incompatible. i had some thoughts about this, but i'll have to spit them out later cuz i am tired and have to be up in 5 hours to go tow my car off the freeway. suffice to say, i believe that there is no problem with intellectualism and the gospel.   i found the 5th episode of 24!!!!!!!!!!! thank god for the internet and mirc

      it's been a good sunday i guess. jeremy spoke during sacrament meeting and gave a great talk. ironically (to my posts yesterday), he talked about how he loved the atmosphere here in happy valley. he came from graduating in pennsylvania and livin the college life there. as i was later telling jeff today. i know so many people who lived the other life, but moved here and said they were truly happy in happy valley. none of my friends who have done otherwise have ever said they were happy. i've had other friends move away, live the other life, but come back becuz they were not happy doing that.  with that said, i'm gonna read the bofm for a while  oh yeah...david paulsen had a cool interview for  urlLink  modern reformation   about the lds view of the godhead. read it  urlLink here

      well...i should hopefully be able to move into my new place this week. jake, who seems cool (heck, he likes south park and philosophy) will prolly be movin in there too.  i'm just getting sick of the crap in my apartment. jess and jeff are great and i'm gonna miss lhavin them around. i just never liked living here. i thought it was going ot be fun, but from day one this apartment has not been enjoyable. i feel like i have no social life living here. i really think things will get better when i move. i found that a lot of people don't want to come to my apartment because of steve. if i'm lucky i can start moving before thanksgiving. i need to go offer some sacrifices to the apartment gods

      derek at work, and his comment (see prev post) started me thinking a lot about my beliefs and life. here are some of my thoughts...   to live  in  happy valley, but not  of  happy valley   sure i rag on happy valley a bit...ok i rag on it a lot. in all reality i like it here. i don't fit the mold. i'm not shaped with the happy valley cookie cutter. but in many ways, living here has helped me shape myself. there is nothing wrong with the happy valley life. it's prolly better than what i live now. a few days ago on southpark, they portrayed mormons as obscenely happy people. it's true in many cases. people here are happy. they enjoy the life they live. i have nothing against people who enjoy living so. i just get bothered with the self-righteousness i perceive in some people. this  i'm better than you  attitude is not exclusive to happy valley though. it's anywhere and everywhere you go. it's a sad part of human nature. in happy valley, people think they are better than me becuz i watch southpark and rated r movies. outside of happy valley, people think they are better than me becuz i don't drink and i choose not to have sex.  i used to complain that it was hard to find things to do here in happy valley. i've come to realize it's been my fault. sure, if you like drinking, it's a little tougher, but that's never been much of an issue for me. i had friends that drank and stufs in highschool. i just never cared for it. my problem is that i stopped being social. i didn't go out to make new friends when my old ones moved out. sure there are less people here that want to go clubbin, but i know they exist. i just need to find them. lately i've been trying to be more social and have found more and more people who want to do fun stufs. there is a wide assortment of people here. people from all over the states. people who have come to realize that life here in happy valley is good. even many of those who lived the opposite of happy valley life. i guess what i'm saying is. the gospel does have the power to make us happier when we embrace it and happy valley is a good place to be able to embrace it   why do i believe anyways?   it's hard to explain why i believe so much in the gospel. at the base of it all, i guess it's just cuz i do. it's hard to explain. i just know inside, in my gut, in my deepest knowledge that god is there, that he loves me, that his son died for me, and that god restored his gospel today. beyond that, it comes to the fruit. when i apply the gospel in my life. i mean really apply it, i am happy. truly happy.   what am i not doing?   when i was dating megan, i felt like i was truly happy. i really was. prolly the happiest i had been in a year. what's different now? obviously i'm not dating megan and that does make a difference. there is something more though.  when i was dating her, she sparked something in me. i started reading my scriptures again. i pushed aside my demons and tried to become a better person spiritually. my prayers became real. i've slacked and need to whip myself back into gear.   impressing others   highschool was all about what others thought about me. what a wasted life. when we spend day in and day out wondering what others think of us, we end up pursuing a life we don't really want. i still do it some. i try to make people think i'm this intellectual who thinks for himself and avoids conformity. it's bad enough when we lie about who we really aren't or don't want to be. it's even worse when we act on it and do things that aren't us or that we really don't want to be. i've tried to be myself or try to be who i want to be.   sin, guilt, integrity   why do i sometimes feel bad about doing something, but don't feel bad about doing other things that i know are wrong. i think it comes down to three things. integrity with god, integrity with others, and integrity with self. my mission president told me of an experience he had at a gas station. a lady saw his nametag and asked him if a cup of coffee would keep her out of heaven. his response was that a cup of coffee would not, but direct disobedience will. i think our level of guilt we feel is directly related to our level of commitment and integrity we are giving. i have found that when i do feel guilt for something, it is because it was something that i had committed to not doing. i broke my integrity with myself. also i have felt this guilt when i have hurt someone else in the act and lost integrity with that person. and i have felt the worst guilt when i know i committed (and i mean really committed) something to god...and then broke it.  on the other end, i notice that when i lack guilt, it is when i failed or seized to commit. when i have failed to decide (or even worse, decided to fail), i have felt no guilt.  i need to commit myself more. i need to make the active decision to follow god and do what is right.   what to do...what to do....   there are some changes i need to make in my life. i need to start praying more involved and personal. my prayers lately have been a routine of thoughtless words. i need to talk to god. talk to him as if he were sitting next to me, listening and responding. i need to do this nightly and when i wake up.  i need to start really reading my scriptures again. not just reading, but studying. they can be such a powerful tool. i did well a couple months ago, but as with other  things, i let it slide i need to serve others more. what better way is there to feel loved, then by expressing it i need to fight my demons i need to keep myself busy. to be active i need to focus on school better. i really want to get grad and post grad degrees. can't do that with lousy grades i need to get out more. i complained that people don't come to hang with me. i need to let them know i'm someone worth hangin with i need to smile. sometimes forcing a small smile can brighten our own day, not to mention others   leave a comment about what you think of this post

      a guy i work with told me he'd be happy if i was still active (in the lds church) in 20 years. basically, here in happy valley, non-comformity to the popular view and zeal is a sure sign of apostacy. so i think god doesn't know the future and i watch southpark...i guess that means i've got one foot in hell already ;)  i realized today that when i move and cancel my internet, i'm gonna lose my webspace for my site. if you know any good info on free/inexpensive webspace....let me know

      tonight's  urlLink south park  was all about mormonism. it took quite a heavy anti-mormon tone at the end, but was rather enjoyable and not totally anti-mormon. matt and trey had to twist some history a bit to make the church look bad. you could tell they did  some  research though

      i think i figured out what my final term paper in my philosophy of religion class is going to be on. (was that a run-on sentance?) it'll prolly be something to the effect of "burning in the bosom: emotional reaction to religious experience." i'm going to argue that the 'burning in the bosom' and other emotions that are often claimed as spiritual experiences are not the actual religious experience, but rather an emotional reaction to an underlying religious experience. in mormon terms, my having that 'burning' is not myself feeling the spirit, but is rather an emotional reaction to knowledge i gain by the spirit. this will also act as a defense to the criticism that we often feel the same feelings of religious experience when we watch movies and listen to music.

      so yeah...i changed (or am in the process of changing) my major to integrated  urlLink philosophy  and  urlLink religious studies  at   urlLink uvsc . i'm very excited for this. i'm gonna finish my bachelors here and then go for some further degree's elsewhere. it would be fun to go back east to yale, notre dame, or another great philosophy school, so i really need to get my ass in gear and pick up my grades. also if i can scrounge up five grande, i'm gonna go to england in the summer to study religious based ethics and 'religion and violence'.  in february, my professors are hosting a mormon theology conference at uvsc. if my final term paper is good enough, i'm gonna submit it to the conference.  urlLink potter  said  urlLink my last paper  wasn't good enough to be submitted, but that if it was reworked it could be. i'd rather do something new though. i'm thinking of maybe writing a paper about god's use of religious myth in scripture and revelation; model's of faith in the lds community; or maybe about the enhanced worshipworthiness of a finite deity.

      mike was supposed to come down to go clubbin tonight, but he got stuck in the snow up in boise. didn't really care to do much else tonight with anyone, so i decided i'm gonna finish the book of mormon and watch some southpark tonight. what a great combination  i'm really not one for new year's resolutions, but i'd thought i'd give some a try and see how badly i fail at them.  go to the temple more often  get back into fly-fishing again  better grades  read the book of mormon along with the gospel doctrince class  that's all i can think of.....  now this isn't a new year's resolution, but my diet is starting back up tomorrow. i kinda let it slide over the break and haven't been to the gym since for a week now. i'd like to get down to 160 lbs...and then up to at least 165 with muscle.

      just finished reading  urlLink  the new mormon challenge  . here are some thoughts about the last two remaining chapters...  finley's critique of lds scholars seeking out hebraisms in the book of mormon had some good points and some huge stretches. i especially found his biblical source for  nahom  to be quite a stretch. i am not too sure about hebraisms in the book of mormon myself. i fidn them interesting, but some of them (especially sentance structure) don't fit my view of the book's translation. i see the book of mormon more as an ancient text put into joseph smith's words. while this view  doesn't necessarily fit the descriptions of the process specualted by some of the witnesses, it does fit the 'official' description of the translation process found in d&c  9:8,9.  i found shepherd's article about translation and pseudotranslation (a fraudulant translation) a very interesting read. it was odd though that he never referred to blake ostler's  the book of mormon as a modern expansion of an ancient source  which nicely welds the two idea of translation and pseudotranslation together. if i can find an online version of this article i'll be sure to post it. it's one of the best articles i've read about the origin of the book of mormon. while shepherd concluded (though stressing it was not definitie) that the book of mormon was a pseudotranslation, i loved this quote of his at the end. "...the book of mormon is the most complex, ambitious, and influential pseudotranslation that the world has ever seen or is, indeed, ever likely to see." and he finishes the article with "...joseph smith was not content to lightly rework and paraphrase existing scripture. instead, armed with the courage of his considerable convictions, joseph smith set out ot fashion his own scripture, creating for himself in the book of mormon a monument to his work as paraphraser and prophet."  i want to jump on to another book...either  urlLink farm 's  urlLink  the temple in time and eternity   or another book which i have not yet decided. first i gotta finish the book of mormon. i'm in the end of 3rd nephi and wanted to finish the book by new years so that i can start afresh with the new year to follow the gospel doctrine class's lessons.

      coincidentally, the  urlLink times and seasons  blog that i have found and enjoyed has had a few discussions which jeff and i were arguing over on saturday and sunday.  here's what someone had to say about the law of consecration that i found insightful and my reply...  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  consecration: a practical suggestion  by gordon smith at december 30, 2003 08:30 pm  one of my pet peeves is the comment, often heard in sunday school, that "the lord has not asked us to live the law of consecration." those who have been to the temple should know better. the more pressing question for me is how to implement this relatively simple law. this seems to be the current topic of conversation under the material prosperity thread below, which, like the eveready bunny, just keeps on going. in this post, i want to propose a practical way of thinking about consecration.  but first, some background. perhaps i was a little severe with my fellow congregants who proclaim that "the lord has not asked us to live the law of consecration." after all, the following comes from the gospel doctrine teacher's manual for the doctrine & covenants:      explain that the fulness of the law of consecration has been lived only at certain times as commanded by the lord. some of the early saints attempted to live the law for periods of time in ohio, missouri, and utah. however, the church as a whole failed to live it, and the lord suspended it. at some future time he will ask us to live the fulness of the law.  this is a little confusing, but the manual seems to be suggesting that the united order was an attempt to live the "fulness of the law of consecration." the implication is that some "lesser" law of consecration might still be in effect. while i am not sure i like the jargon, i get the drift. my view is that this "lesser law of consecration" is simply the law of consecration without centralized administration. it is, if you will, a personal law of consecration, rather than a collective expectation.  so, what does this "lesser law of consecration" demand of us. here is some discussion fodder from bruce r. mcconkie: "the law of consecration is that we consecrate our time, our talents, and our money and property to the cause of the church; such are to be available to the extent they are needed to further the lord’s interests on earth." this is the usual response that i hear when i raise this question in church. the inference usually drawn is that we don't actually have to share all of "our time, our talents, and our money and property" until we are asked. at the moment, the reasoning goes, we are asked to share some of our time, a few of our talents, and 10% of our income (plus occasional offerings). the residual is ours to keep.  can this be right? again, the covenant that i made in the temple includes no such limitations. but mcconkie's statement contains the seeds of a useful method of thinking about the law of consecration. in my view, we are obliged to use all of our time, talents, money, and property to further the lord’s interests on earth. period.  every minute and every dollar should be consecrated to the lord's work, which includes raising our families, doing missionary work (by word and by deed), offering productive labor at the workplace, etc. every aspect of our lives is relevant to our eternal salvation, and every aspect should be pointed in the same direction. this is the essence of an integrated life. the law of consecration should cause us to purge selfishness from our souls -- no more "mine" and "his," but all his. and in the great paradox expressed by jesus, when we lose ourselves in this way, we gain eternal life. (mark 8:35)   comments    i had a nice argument with my friend saturday night about this very thing. he gave me the same response word for word that you quoted. he also added the popular myth "the prophet said not to worry about consecration and just to focus on tithing and fasting." when asked for a reference, the common reply came "all the prophets have said it." of course, my disbelief in these statements proved that i don't believe in the prophets ;)  one of the big myth's in the church is that in order to live the law of consecration, a large group of individual must live it by some sort of social contract. i think the most practical way to live it was taught by king benjamin. basically, to give to the poor. as an in debt college student, probably the greatest joy i felt this christmas season was buying some books at barnes and noble for underpriviledged children. Comment by: tyler durden at December 30, 2003 08:41 PM    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i agree with gordon. we should be giving all that we had. i am hypocritical though. i could give so much more, but it's hard. why is it so tough? i can't use the excuse that i'm an in-debt college student becuz i still spend much of my money on luxuries and fast food that i just don't need.  ...speaking of fast food....i let myself go over the christmas break. i've eaten like a pig and have only hit the gym a few times. starting new years, i gotta get myself back in gear. i think tomorrow i'll post up some resolutions and see how crappy i live up to them as the year goes by.

      i've been reading  urlLink  the new mormon challenge  . it's an interesting read. as far as 'anti-mormon' books go, this is by far the most courteous and intellectually engaging one i have read. this does not mean i agree with them. so far, i'm about 3/4 of the way through the book  hazen's and mosser's introductory articles about the growth of membership and the 'apologetic  impulse' was rather interesting. these articles weren't too critical, but rather gave a synopsis of how the church is right now.  copan and craig's arguements for creation  ex nihilo  weren't all that great. there scriptural arguements seemed strong at first (which really means nothing to me), but their deductive arguements seemed flawed and and their inductive arguements seemed outdated. for an awesome review of their arguements (which in my opinion, crush their arguements) see blake ostler's  urlLink review.   adam's and owen's articles were pretty much the same ' i think the scriptures say this ' that shows up all over the place in discussions like this. they are some of the first to really reply to lds claims of polytheism/henotheism in the early church and israelite religion, but they seem to ignore some of the greater arguements made  parrish's article was interesting, but i think he spent too much time beating a straw god..i mean man. mosser's arguement was seriously flawed. see ostler's  urlLink review  for arguements criticizing theirs  i haven't read orson pratt's  absurdities of immaterialism  so i can't say much about moreland's criticism of it  blomerg's article discussing whether or not mormons are christian was another interesting read. it was courteous, and i can better understand why some evangelical believe that we cannot be properly classified as christian in their eyes, but i still found his arguements flawed. for a  beautiful  reply, read what kent jackson had to say  urlLink here   that's as far as i have gotten. i'll give my thoughts on the rest when i finish the book in the next  couple days

       why don't you believe in the prophets?   i get sick of hearing that. why can't some stupid mormons realize that there is no papal infallibilty clause in the lds church. so i don't blindly follow every word every general authority says. somehow that turns into me lacking a testimony. so i don't praise mcconkie and hold him up as the standard of truth. big deal.  search. ponder. pray. the scriptures tell us this is the way we are to gain gospel knowledge. nobody every ponders nor prays, they hardly even search. people just want to be told what to believe and cling to it blindly. if you actually take to the time to examine what you should believe, you are treated as heretical.

      got commenting put back on the site. feel free to tell me what you think.  here's are some thoughts from my day    michael jackson   saw an interview with him on 60 minutes. whether or not he is guilty, he is one messed up guy. i wonder how accountable a person like he is to god. his mental abilities are obviously not working how they should be. does he realize how stupid and crazy he appears?   book of revelation   talked about the signs of the times and the book of revelation today in gospel doctrine. i feel that people force too much literalism into the book. it's obvious that so much of it is not literal, but must me read metaphorically. why then force literalism in where a metaphorical view may be much more morally benefitting. besides a call to put one's life in order, i see no point in speculating on signs of the times when interpretations can be so varying   bruce r. mcconkie   i love the man for his testimony and gospel zeal. i can't stand his false authority he placed on his opinions. so many accept what he said without even wondering if maybe he could be wrong. it's not necessarily what he espoused, but more of how he did it. he taught things as if his view was the correct view and differing views were heretical products of satan

      i got hooked up with some new webspace. i'm going to throw  urlLink my website  on it, but i'm not sure if i'm gonna keep it up there long. i might jus simplify it to use as a menu to access papers, photos, and other crap.  speaking of crap, my last philosophy of religion paper,  urlLink  exclusivism and a systematic theology   is now available for your reading pleasure.  in other news.... christmas came and went. as my family and i have gotten older, the joy of christmas seems to haev dimmed. the best part of it all is watching people open the gifts i had given them. the  emptiness  hit me pretty bad christmas eve and dragged on till this morning (26th). the highlight of this christmas season was when i was at barnes and noble the morning of christmas eve and spent $40 in books for under-privildged children. i got the first  harry potter  book for a 10 year old girl and the  captain underpants  collection for an 8 year old boy. that felt friggin good :)

      with finals and all, i have been too busy to write much on this thing. plus i've been out and about dating and making more friends lately. i should have time this break to write more of my thoughts.  today in priesthood we were discussing becoming a zion people. if it weren't for our blasted love of money, we could be there. i try to be giving. in fact i give too much. i've already donated about $50 this month to different charities and stufs. i just feel good doing it. i should be giving more though. i don't need half the crap i have. there are so many people out there that need so much. i should be willing to help them. in the temple, we covenant to live the law of consecration. why aren't we willing to do what we have promised? the teacher today had a great quote by orson pratt that i need to find. in it, he says that as long as we have more than another that we are living in sin. king benjamin said that we must give until we can say in our heart that we would give, but we cannot for we have nothing to give. i need to have that mentality even more.  of course. in all reality, i don't have any to give. i'm $3000 in debt. its an excuse though. i spend money on myself all of the time. money that coulld be better spent on others.

      yipee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  finals are all done. i think i aced both of them today. they were essay's so i won't know for sure till after the weekend. also, my last philosophy paper got the highest score in the class again.  urlLink potter  said it was the best in the class, but he also said the rest of the papers sucked, so i guess it doesn't mean all that much. he also told me that i should definately go into philosophy and should go for a graduate degree. i'm prolly going to do a double major with a b.a. in philosophy and my previous integrated studies major as well. it'll only take me an extra semester or so.  tomorrow i am going to sit my butt in front of the tv and watch lord of the rings all day long and then see return of the king with tory and jenna at night.  life is good

      “look, maybe us mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe joseph smith did make it all up. but i have a great life, and a great family, and i have the book of mormon to thank for that. the truth is, i don’t care if joseph smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. all i ever did was try to be your friend, stan, but you’re so high and mighty you couldn’t look past my religion and just be my friend back. you’ve got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. suck my balls.”   ---gary harrisons classic closing words in  urlLink south park 's 'all about the mormons' episode a few weeks ago

      holy crap, my ward's christmas activity was  lame . well actually, every activity this ward (which is not many) have been lame. to be honest, i did have a fun time, but it was not because of the activity. it was because of the good friends i was with. like the thanksgiving activity, they did not have enough food. there was hardly anything planned at all. they didn't even bring bowls or spoons for the icecream. this ward seriouslt needs new leadership in for the activities. i think this largely the reason why the ward is so anti-social now.  i'm beginning to have a lot more fun here. there are people that i've found who are fun to hang out with. i wish i was more social when the semester began. megan would have enjoyed hanging out with all these people. its too bad that she doesn't want to be near me. i would almost be willing to back off by myself if it would make her feel more comfortable hanging out with everyone. haven't seen her for over a month. hope she is happy.

      worked until 8 tonight. by the time i got home, everyone was out doing there own thing. a bunch of people went to temple square to see the lights. i really wanna go this winter, so i need to find someone to take. i ended up hitting the gym for a while and then sitting back with a movie and a book.   should charity be bounded by time and distance?   i went to smith's for my lunch break today to get myself a salad. as i was entering there was one of those salvation army dudes ringing his bell. i told myself that i was going to make a donation as i was leaving. as i left, i almost forgot, but after hearing the bells, i turned myself around to throw in a few bills. open my wallet. only a ten. i about turned back, but decided to drop in the ten. folded it. about to push in the bucket. its not a ten. its a twenty. i am rather strapped for cash right now, i could sacrifice a ten, but a twenty would be a little too much to for me right now. of course, this is from a guy who minutes before spent five dollars on a spinache salad. i will make a donation tomorrow though. i'll pass on lunch and donate ten.  the whole situation got me thinking though...here a two quick thoughts  time. why is it that everyone seems to care about others during december (and maybe november), but not the rest of the year? are people ay less hungry or in need in march or september? i try to be giving most of the year, but i admit i also do better on giving during the christmas season. one thing that really pushed me into wanting to be a philanthropist was hugh nibley's  urlLink  approaching zion  . after reading that book, i had a huge desire to share my blessings with others. i feel bad now when i pass a beggar(sp?) but fail to give.  distance. here's the situation. you are going to an expensive restaurant and a movie and are only carrying enough money to pay for those things. on the way there, you pass a child who is suffering from starvation. with the money you have, you could get him some food, provide him with some necessities, and still have a small amount left to provide yourself with a simple meal. who could pass that child, acknowledge his existance and suffering, fail to help, but still feel good about herself? who would not consider neglecting the child as anything short of morally deplorable? who would not consider helping this child her mortal duty?  situation two. same as above, but there is no starving child on the way to your dinner. the child is in africa (or maybe in a nearby shelter). you know a starving child exists and you could help him with your money. is it your moral duty to help this child? does distance make neglecting a child in africa any less morally disgusting?  think about it .............................................................................  here are the lyrics for the day...  don’t fear, even though you’re at a loss. i’m numb, a shell of empty thoughts. but you glow, you stretch and pull me out. does that trouble you?  does that trouble you?   love me hate me make me live again i need you around  heal me hurt me make me live again i want you around  so long, i never had experienced this bliss. so how could i resist?  and i’m fine a little light-headed. does that worry you?  i didn’t mean to worry you.  now, retreating from the light i love it when we fight it makes me think at least you still care  give up, you’re not going anywhere moonlight, illuminates your stare and it’s great, captivating you does that trouble you?  i didn’t mean to trouble you  ---better than ezra---

      ever wonder what it's like to talk to your professor about philosophy while taking a piss in the restroom? well i now know what it is like.  potter talked about the  urlLink study abroad in england  trip this spring. i seriously want to go so bad. if i go, i'll be studying relgious based ethics, religion and violence, and some independant study course. i'll also get to go to paris for a weekend and a small trip to belfast as part of the study of religious violence with the catholic-protestant battles over there. it's gonna cost me five thousand bones though. i'm going to have to take out a loan.

      gawd i love philosophy. i am seriously so glad i switched majors. now the big problem is all the grades i got in my computer classes. i really want to go into further education prolly back east, but in order to do that, i need to seriously fix my grades.  my final paper for my philosophy class is due a week from today. i think i'm gonna go with the whole religious experience topic, but prolly not specific to mormonism.  in other news... i was sitting in one of my classes today and all of the sudden started seeing stars. it seemed like it lasted for a few minutes. i've only had that happen b4 when i've hit my head. crazy stufs. maybe its a tumor ;) ok...prolly not

       god bless the u.s.a. where all men are created equal   ...unless you are black, asian, native american, non-[traditional]christian, female, or anything else that is not the typical male white christian. i've been reading ronald takaki's  urlLink  a different mirror  . it's hard to imagine and sickening when imagined how peoples of other races have been treated in the nation. from the black slaves to the american-born japanese thrown out of their homes into internment camps during the second world war. in the twenty-first century, we have definately matured and are doing much better, but we still have much more to do. a couple years ago following the sept 11 attacks, a roommate of mine thought it was a funny joke to stick a sign on the refridgerator saying 'kill all ragheads'. i got so pissed. what if it had been some asians? would we think it funny to hang a 'kill all japs' sign? obviously i would not have thought it funny. i didn't find my roommates sign at all funny either and yelled at him to take it down. i just don't see how some people can actually hate someone just because of the color of their skin, their religion, or their nationality.  in other news...i canceled the internet in my last apartment and thus lost my webspace. the site and associated links will be down until i put them in a new home  christmas time is here and oh golly gee i love it. i used to be the one who put up most of the christmas decorations around my home growing up. i need to run home and find my small christmas tree to put here in the apartment. hopefully the holiday spirit will help some in lifting my spirit.

       will the real loyd ericson please stand up   somebody once accused me of being fake. am i a fake? i don't believe i am. i wonder if i do come off as one though. i admit that i'm not normal and i'm rather unconventional. i try to be myself. i don't hold back. i enjoy discussing philosophy. i'm passionate about it. what does that equal? it equals me trying to hard to look like an intellectual. i love cracking jokes. that means i try to hard to seem funny. i enjoy sushi and the symphony. that means i'm trying to hard to seem cultured. is it that i really am trying to hard? or is it more that i'm abnormal enough that it just doesn't seem real and thus must be a mirage i'm throwing over myself. i guess i just need to continue to be myself. if someone doesn't like who i really am, they can kiss my butt. i do need to soften things down though. perhaps i do flaunt my person to try to be accepted. if i do, i'm at least flaunting who i really am. i'm not one of those persons who acts as though they are someone else to be accepted by others.

       testimonies and testicles   i learned today in my western religions class that a testimony, or the sharing of it, began as an oath with the ancient israelites. in context of the abrahamic covenant to have numberless prosterity, the oath was made on those future descendants by grabbing the source while stating the promise. that's right, they grabbed their balls as they made the oath.  think about this as you bare your testimony this sunday.

      a man puts his gun to your head and ask if you believe in jesus. if you say yes, he pulls the trigger and you die. if you say no, he lets you live. what is the right thing to do? most will say that we should tell the truth and die. is it better to profess our faith and end our lives, or is it better to deny it (but still retain our inner convictions) to preserve our lives so that we can do more good in the world? if jesus were standing there and you were able to ask him what he wanted you to do, what answer would he give?  now the scenario is obviously unlikely, but this is exactly how the media portrayed an incident in the columbine shootings. i personally think the story is bunk, or at least flowered.

       sins, transgressions, adam, satan, and a mango   why a mango? because a freshly picked, tree-ripened mango is the most tempting piece of fruit on earth.  in both my western religions class and my institute class, we have been discussing the garden of eden. in the former, we are looking at the eden  myth  and how it has been interpreted in jewish and christian thought, and in the latter we began discussing what made adam's choice a  transgression , rather than a  sin . now for some thoughts...  1. sin vs transgression. by strict definition, there is nothing different between the two. according to my institute teacher, joseph fielding smith was the first two popularize a supposed distinction between the two. often the distinction given is that a  sin  is a deliberate rebellion of god's laws, while a  transgression  is an ignorant breaking of god's laws. the problem here is that adam was explicitly commanded not to eat the mango. there was no ignorance in his choice. so why this lexical distinction? i think there are a couple main reasons why people want to say that adam  transgressed  rather than  sinned . the first reason is that adam  sinning  (especially in traditional christianity) is seen as a terrrible action and all mankind is screwed because of it. as lds, we see adam's choice as a necessary and noble step in the plan of salvation. how dare we call such a noble step by what it actually is, a sin. so in order to preserve adam's dignity, we call it a  transgression . it just sounds better. the other reason why we want to call in a transgression, is because of the necessity the book of mormon places on the fall. god put adam in a tight spot. either way, adam was going to sin. either he ate the mango, or he breaks the commandment to multiply. adam had no choice to not sin. it was inevitable. to save god's dignity, we pull out our transgression card and save god from forcing adam to sin.  2. myth vs history. this, i believe, is the key to understanding the garden of eden. i;'m sorry to say it, but there wasn't a garden with naked people made from clay, frolicking around, hanging out with talking snakes, and eating magic mango. does this mean that the genesis account isn't  true ? no. it just means that the events didn't actually happen as they were revealed. i believe that there was a first man and woman on the earth, but i'm sure there story was rather boring. so why the story? i think god revealed the garden  myth  to teach us about ourselves. it's a narrative drama about our own nature and place in this world. in the book of moses,  adam  is  many  and as we go through the temple, we are adam and eve. the story is not about a couple of nudists in hawaii, it's about you and me. the account begins with placing us in the universe. the world was made for us. each aspect of the natural universe (the heavens, seas, land, animals, plants, etc) was designed and placed for out betterment (is that a word?). the myth is no longer about how some guy way back when sinned and fell, it's about how we individually have sinned and fallen. we have each eaten the mango in one way or another and are screwed without the saving powers of our savior. sin is a  necessary  aspect of our progression. we need to have experienced it to have a true knowledge of good and evil (this is rather controversial). i do use  neccessary   with caution though. as jesus showed, it is entirely possible to live a life without sin. though he still needed to experience it by proxy in getheseme. we are all on earth, a mango is dangled before us. we give in. luckily wer'e not accountable for our wrongs until we are around eight, but as soon as that time comes, it prolly took us less than a few minutes to take the fruit. not by necessity, not even by nature, but by our free-will. the actual possibilty existed for us to totally abstain from sin, but we don't. luckily, god gave us a way out.

      allrighty...the pics from our cabin trip are in  urlLink my photo album . that trip was hella fun. it sucked at first cuz right before we left, jenna found out that she couldn't go. and then as we were driving up there, i got us lost....again. last time i went up there, i missed the firt turn and my car ended up breaking down. good memories.... anyways, i got the first couple turns right, but then i got us lost. the only time i had driven up there was in the fall during the day. the place looks totally different in the night with tons of snow. it also didn't help that the snow plows only plowed certain streets, so i had to take a different path up there. it took over an hour to drive what should have been about five minutes. once we got there, everything was a blast. we had pizza and all sorts of yummies, played games, watched  death to smoochy  and talked till about 3am. in the morn we got up ate toast and eggs, cleaned up and left.  i was supposed to go clubbin last night, but my buddy mike never called me to tell me which club they were going ot be at. major bummer. i'm gonna call him later today verbally abuse him. i ended up watching  dead poets society  last night with jenna and then talked with her till abut 3. i am hella tired now, but i still have ward choir practice, a potluck at my apartment, and some studying to do. i'm sure i'll slip in a npa somewhere in there.

      i'm shooting for a personal record for entries today...  today, a rep for the study abroad in england came over to my deductive logic class to promote it. i totally want to go. it' goes from early may to mid june. i'll be studying  religion and violence  with my favorite professor dennis potter and  religious based ethics  with my second fav proffessor, brian birch. i will also be doing some independant study as well. the trip to london includes a 4 day break in paris and a trip to belfast ireland to meet with an unofficial branch of the ira. in all, it'll cost about 5 thousand dollars. i should be able to get enough loans and aid to pay for it... i hope. the only thing holding me back is my best buddy and friend tory and melanie are getting married in mid-may. i really want to be there for that, but i think they'd understand. this could be my only opportunity to do a study abroad, cuz who knows what the future holds. on wednesday there is an open-house for it where i'll be learning more about it. i'm stoked.  i have to say, that for the first time in a long time, i really enjoy going to school. it's fun again. i love what i am studying and found something that i want to do for a career. a part of me has always wanted to be a teacher, but i didn't know what i wanted to teach, and being a highschool teacher just didn't pay what i wanted to raise my future family. i got great help in realizing i needed to make the change. its too bad it happened this late, cuz now i need to fix my grades from the past year or so.

      sometimes i wish i didn't care about people. i wish i could look them in the eye and tell them to f*** off and not care about how they feel. now i wouldn't really want to do anything like that. there is nobody i dislike enough. there isn't even anybody that i could say i dislike.  i just sometimes wish i could have the disregard for their feelings that they have for me. but i can't. i still care about and i still love those who mean a lot to me.

      drove up to my parents cabin with jenna tonight to see if it was going to be possible to drive up on friday night. unfortunately, my car could not make it up all of the way. hopefully i'll be able to figure out some other means to get up there for friday night. took jenna out to dinner at a nice little mexican restaurant in heber and then watched g.i. jane (not that great of movie) at her apartment. she's a lot of fun to talk and hang out with and i've enjoyed the time i've spent with her lately.  .............................   summum   tory and i are going up to visit the  urlLink summums  for some school projects in a few weeks. he's gonna write a daily universe article about them and i'm gonna do a project on them for my western religions class. they've got a pyramid, mummies, and a golden wiener

      ok...well last night didn't turn out exactly as i expected. no celebrities and not too many girls. besides that, i had a blast. crystal method ended up spinning mixes instead of playing their own stuff, but they totally ripped the place up. there was not a single bad song the entire night and the crowd was going strong the whole time. well actually, before crystal method started, the crowd sucked and nobody would dance. it didn't help that the dj preceding crystal method was pathetic. i had a great time though and danced my butt off until 2 in the morning. which leaves me especially tired considering i didn't get home until almost 3 and had to wake up at 7 for classes. i got some fun pics of my friends and i though. i'll be going up to salt lake on saturday to do some more clubbing. it was about time i was able to get out doing that again.  ..................  apparantly somebody didn't like the photos in my photo album (and to be honest, i didn't like them either. i just threw them on to test the photo album capabilites of  urlLink dreamweaver ) i've swapped the pictures in the album with  urlLink photos from last night . i still need to go through the pictures, remove the red-eye and delete a few of the redundant ones. the phots of me didn't end up looking to flattering ...................  if you want to comment on entries in this stupid blog of mine, click the comment line after the entry and use that instead of the guestbook.

      is the path worth taking?  staring at the fork in the road thinking aloud to myself is the path worth taking? last time it brought so much joy last time it brought so much pain  looking to the easy path only it doesn't seem so easy varying possibilites endless conclusions  yearning for the difficult path opening to paths out of my control happiness and sadness  making the decision is the toughest part everyone says to take the easy gone will be the chance of pain and yet i don't want to never knowing if i might have had the joy

       hold tight to your dreams   ...so says the little piece of paper from my fortune cookie hanging on mirror. are dreams worth holding on to? yes and no. dreams can give us purpose and drive, but dreams can also bring us dissapointment. i guess it come down to weighing out the dreams. is the goal worth the possible pain? usually it isn't. however, now and then, a dream comes around. something fantastic. something if it came into fruition, would be worth all the possible pain and dissapointment. i'm willing to take that risk.

      hung out with tory, mel, megan, and jake tonight. just had some good ol' hanging out fun.it was really nice to hang out wiht megan again. that girl is just incredible. i don't know what it is about her, but it's somethin special. i really missed having her as a friend. so i'm glad thats kinda back.  elder groberg came to the institute for a devotional. her used experiences from his mission, along with clips from the movie abotu his mission to make some points. they were 1. god gives us confidence to do what is right. 2. pray to be an answer to someone else's prayers. 3. be open to being wrong when yu ask god for somethig.   urlLink john searle  came to uvsc for the philosophy of education conference today as well. he's one of the top few philosophers in the nation about the study of mind and the study of language.  he said there are 6 things that every student should gain from their colege experience. 1. to be able to speak and write clearly. 2. a sense of their own cultural tradition. 3. a basic knowledge of how the world works. 4. a basic knowledge of how society works. 5. a foreign language they can feel comfortable with. 6. enough philosophy to construct a logical arguement.  i gotta work on most of those. besides this blog, i have 1 pretty goods i thinks. ;)  2, 3, and 4 i'm working on. lost in 5 and i think i got 6 rather well.

      "if men do not comprehend the character of god, they do not comprehend themselves" - joseph smith  so yeah, i don't believe god is all-powerful or all-knowing in the classical sense. i'm a finitist...and thus blasphemous.  urlLink god does not have an absolute knowledge of the future , nor is he all powerful. there are some things which he just cannot do. for example, we have agency. it's something that we've always had and always will have. god cannot control us. there are just some things out of his control. i think this is best exemplified in moses 7 where enoch sees god weeping and cannot understand how a might all-powerful god can weep. enoch learns that god is weeping because things are not all in his control. his children had turned evil and there was nothing he could do about it.  what does this all mean? why would anyone want to worship a finite deity that is not all-knowing or all-powerful? here is why. a god that is not in total control is a god that is actively in the battle with me. he constantly watches me, feels real pain when i fail him, a real joy when i succeed. this is only possibly when he does not absolutely know what i can do. my future is not guaranteed. life is not easy. i can't sit back and let the world happen and expect it to turn out in any way that i want. god is the same way. his plan is not guaranteed by his power. he needs to be an active part in the plan. he is just as much into this as i am. my challenges are his challenges. just as it is not easy for me, it is not easy for him. it is much harder for him. and i love him even more for perservering in helping me.  why else do i believe god is finite? because i will be like him. as i said in an earlier post, life would be boring and pointless if we had power to make things just as we wanted them. we progress though challenge. if progression and being like god means that i no longer learn, and that i have no more challenges, then count me out and send me to hell.

       scripture as general conference or general conference as scripture   as latter-day saints, we usually hold teachings from the latter-day prophets and teachings from the scriptures at different levels. the words in the scriptures are usually viewed as authoritative and doctrinally binding truths, but view talks from the latter-day prophets with a lesser status. in stephen robinson's book  urlLink how wide the divide , robinsons says that the living prophets have a higher authority, but when it comes to doctrine, he asserts that the scriptures are the only source of official doctrine.  why should a 'general conference' talk by king benjamin and a letter from the apostle paul be seen as any different than a general conference talk by brigham young and an ensign article by apostle oaks? in the end i think there are two alternatives, we can view all general conference talks as most latter-day saints would normally view scripture(infallible, especially as most lds view the book of mormon). this route will make it that everything every latter-day prophet leader has said is doctrinally binding; or we could accept scripture as we would accept general conference talks (not infallible). this route would mean that the possibility exists that nephi, paul, or moses were wrong in some of the things things they taught.  what do you think?

       the butterfly effect   went and saw a screener for  urlLink  this movie   tonight and absolutely loved it. have you ever thought that if you could go back in time and fix just one thing in your life, that your life would be much better? the movie explores that very idea. i used to struggle with this at times. always thinking that things would be better if i could just go back and change one thing that i did. the past is the past though, and nothing can change that. all i can change is now and hope that the future follows what i hope for.   balancing my educational, economical, social, physical, and intellectual lives   i think i'm going to be swamped with school this semester. at the seame times, this is the first semester that i've felt i can actually get a 4.0. i don't wanna end up as a slave to school though. i need to balance my time for school, work, dating/friends, the gym, and reading. with my  refellowshipment  coming up in a month, i want to feel complete this semester in all the aspects of my life.   1st level generals   do professors need to treat us as if we are idiots in these 1st level classes? yes. i go to uvsc. many/most of the students in these classes are probably idiots. the professors say there are no stupid questions. i disagree. i hear stupid questions by the dozen each day in these classes.   institute   went to lectures of faith. not impressed by the girls. gonna turn off the philosophy side of my brain and try a new testament class on monday.   kissing on a first date   not a good idea when she leaves the next day for winter vacation and you don't see her for a couple weeks. to be continued....

      day one of school went off without any problems. it turned out that  logical thinking  isn't a prereq for  deductive logic , so i'll be able to take both. for institute, i went to the  articles and lectures of faith  class. it looks like it'll be an interesting class, but it was rather lacking in the quanitity and quality of girls that i am looking for. i think i'll hit a new testament class instead on friday and see how the prospects are over there.  i got my new digital camera today. i haven't had a chance to play with it yet. i'll post some pics up when i do.

      i love goin to the gym...well...i love coming home from the gym after working out. it's a nice feeling  school starts tomorrow as does institute. the question is: is the actual primary purpose of institute to meet girls or to learn about the gospel? cuz for the most part, i can't do both. it seems the classes that are open for a deeper discussion of the gospel tend to have fewer girls and the ones that the girls attend tend to have a pretty shallow forum of discussion. what should i do? i only have room for one class.  i'm tempted to take lectures on faith with hyde. i know he's a good instructor, but i also feel like i'll find myself with a differing opinion much of the time...and i'll want to share and explain that opinion. or i could take a new testament class that is sure to have girls and just suppress my opinion. leave me a comment with what i should do.

      got that nasty student loan problem taken care of. that's a nice relief. it got denied initially becuz my professors, dennis potter and brian birch,  didn't post my grade for my philosophy of religion class until friday.  oh well...all taken care of now. my roommate had the same class at byu with david paulsen and he still doesn't have a posted grdae for that class...and byu's new semester started today!!!  started reading truman madsen's  eternal man  in the collection,  urlLink  five classics by truman madsen  . just got into it, so i don't have anything yet to say about it.  i'm stoked for this semester. i'll be getting my last generals our of the way (biology and astronomy) and will be taking several classes for my majors (intro to western religions, intro to eastern religions, logical thinking, and hopefully deductive logic)  gonna be a lot of studying to do this semester.

      school is about to start in a few days. lucky for me, uvsc decided to start a couple days after byu this year. this is good, because my financial aid loan has not gone through yet. i got a letter yesterday that said it was because i have failed to meet the requirements for the aid. i think it was because my philosophy of religion grade wasn't posted until friday (i got an 'a' bytheway). hopefully, i'll be able to straighten it all up tomorrow.  i've got 18 credits scheduled for this semester. it might drop to 15 though. i am still waiting for a response from one of my professors as to whether i can take a class in the same semester as it's pre-req or if i have to take them sequentially. hope fully i here back b4 the class starts.  saved eighty dollars getting my books online at  urlLink bestbookbuys.com .

      read james faulconer's  urlLink scripture study: tools and suggestions  it's a pretty quick read, only hundred twenty somethin pages. he has got a lot of insight about lookign at scriptures in new ways and stufs. i especially enjoyed the two appendices about scripture/history and hebrew/greek world-views. those are some things that have really added to my understanding of the scriptures the last few years. so all you mormons (and non-mormons) go pick it up!...and read it too ;)

      saw tim burton's  urlLink big fish  last night. absolutely loved it. i'm a big tim burton fan and it was definately one of his best. basically the movie is about a dying father who's life was made up of far-fetched stories, and a son wishing to know who his father really was.   big fish  made me think of an aspect of the scriptures that has been on my mind lately, the value of stories. much of the scriptures (especially the old testament), is made up of stories that may or may not be historically true. does historical accuracy have any bearing on the value of scripture. does it need to be historically true? for example, i don't believe that the garden of eden story actually happened. if i look at it as being historically true, it has little bearing on me. it really means nothing to me. adam fell and now i'm fallen. that's all that is really important about the events in the garden. but what if the story really didn't happen? what is it's purpose. the temple answers this the best. in the temple, i am adam. the story of the fall isn't about some old guy, it's a story about me, my own fall, and how i can return. it's narrative value far surpasses its historical value.

       club vortex   just got back from clubbing with my buddies. this place kicks trash. stupid me forgot my camera though. this place was seriously awesome. 3 dance floors, beautiful women, great atmosphere, plenty of people, techno and hip-hop on seperate floors. plus it's 18+ so we can bring our under-21 friends along. we're definately thinking of getting some memberships here, cuz this is a place i could go everyweekend i have nothing else to do (which tends to happen frequently). i am beat, time for a shower and bed  oh yeah.....the infamous  urlLink wee man  from jackass was there too. how cool is that?

       twisted   went and saw the  urlLink ashley judd/samuel jackson  thriller  . it sucks. don't see it.    hypnotism   also went with my friends to see a hypnotist. it was pretty hilarious. it looked like a couple people were faking it though which kinda ruined some of it though. next time i go, maybe i'll volunteer.

       d'oh!   i'm reading my  evolution and mormonism  book before my astronomy class. apparantly i forgot to pick it up after class because it is no where to be seen. it really sux to be halfway through a book and then lose it. ughghhghh.....    urlLink    so until i can get a new copy, i'll be moving on with  socrates cafe . basically, the book is about the author's experiences as he traveled around the nation starting up little philosophy groups. the groups reminded me about the black light discussions my buddy mike and i used to have where we would turn on some black lights, invite some people over, and philosophy about this and that. those were the good ol' days.  i'm already about 1/2 the way done with this book. i think i'll be reading  the da vinci code  next

       the cross   something that has been on my mind since my mission which has been on my mind even more lately is the lds view of the cross and the crucifixion. what best represents this is a couple quotes from  urlLink meridian magazine 's  urlLink letters to the editor .  "i believe our strength comes from the knowledge of what christ endured physically, emotionally, and spiritually in gethsemane--and then the resurrection and the joy and hope it brings into our lives."  "remember, the catholic symbol is christ on the cross.  they focus on that symbol constantly.  the protestants at least have the symbol of the empty cross, perhaps more signifying the resurrection.  whereas we, as latter-day saints, don't use the cross  at all  because we do focus on the resurrection.(emphasis added)"  when did christ's physical suffering and crucifixion become so meaningless in  popular  lds doctrine? there are dozens and dozens of references to the physcal suffering, the cross, and death/crucifixion of christ in lds scriptures. yet today, many lds find the cross as something almost repulsive. what happened? have we lost the concept of the sacrificial lamb? christ's death was not just a phase between gethsemene and the empty tomb. his sacrifice was a necessary component of the atonement. read your book of mormon. it's practically in every chapter. yes, as latter-day saints, we do put more focus on the events in gethsemene because of the further insight we have recieved from modern revelations. this should in no way lesson the impact of the crucuifixion, but rather we should love that aspect of the atonement even more because of it. it wasn't just some guy who was beat and nailed to a cross to die. this was our god who took upon himself each of our sins and was beat and nailed to the cross to pay for each of our sins.  many christian's don't just wear crosses to remind them of the way jesus died, but they wear it for the same reason that many mormons have an iron rod on their keychain or a ctr ring. they wear it as a reminder that we are each to take up the cross. something that is mentioned not just a few times in our scriptures.    another thing   i like this quote from a person who is choosing to not watch  the passion   "but i am seeing one thing that troubles me, and that is that some members seem to be taking a "holy" stance in declining the experience.  i hope that those that choose to see the film are not judged less obedient, less faithful."  check out the rest of the  urlLink letters to the editor . of some who fit that very thing.

       the passion   i think keith merrill (director of  the testaments ) voiced my thoughts on the movie best...  "it was for me an uncommon experience that transcended most of what we have come to expect in the movie theater .....  it is graphic. it is intense. it is brilliantly crafted. it is enlightening. it is difficult to watch at times. it is something i would not want to miss. not everyone will be able to watch it. not everyone should. but for those who go prepared and abandon themselves to the experience, it can be remarkable. as a follower of christ, i am grateful that mel gibson gave so much to give me the experience of walking beside the savior in his final hours." (merrill's full review can be found  urlLink here )  i absolutely loved this movie. kudos to mel gibson for risking so much in making this awesome film.  there is so much that i really liked about this movie. here are a few things....    the mother-son relationship between mary and jesus  . this was easily my favorite aspect of the movie. throughout the whole film, there is an underlying theme of this strong bond of love that they share. this is wonderfully depicted in a beautiful flashback of mary making a meal as a youthful jesus finishes a table he is making. the both of them laugh and joke around with eachother. until i saw this movie, i never really thought of the pain that mary went through as she witnessed her son be tortured and crucified. at times, i found her anguish even harder to watch then the pain afflicted on the savior.   satan  . from gethesemene to the end, satan is the real antagonist. he tries to push doubt on jesus in the garden, watches with glee as the savior suffers, and then in the end screams in defeat as he realizes he was a means to a glorious end.   gethsemene  . this is where the movie begins. often christians look past the events in gethsemene and give no second thought to it. i think gibson portrayed it well. you could actually see th saviour sweating blood. it was not at all easy. he nearly passes out and falls to the ground in agony. well done.   christ's love  . the crucifying was hard to watch. it was so real, but what made my eyes water up was when christ plead for his captor's forgiveness as they were nailing his feet to the cross. i thought to myself, "could i do that? could i forgive someone as they were inflicting such pain on me?" and even more than that, i love how gibson had the savior not only pleaing the forgiveness of the roman soldiers, but for the jewish leaders who condemned them. beautiful.   symbolism  . there is so much more that i loved about this movie, but this is the last i'll comment on. gibson filled the movie with awesome and beautiful symbolism. jesus crushing the snake in gethsemene. the man who (at first) unwillingly helps carry the christ's cross and his words, "i will help, but know that i am innocent and this is the condemned man." his later carrying, not just the cross, but also jesus to calvary. the single drop of rain (which i read was supposed to be a tear from god). the torment of judas. the flashbacks to jesus's triumphant entry to jerusalem as he was spit upon and berated 5 days later. the flashbacks to mary running to help the fallen child jesus, as she rushes to her blood-soaked son. the movie was just incredible

       religious diversity roundtable   this thing was pretty cool, they basically had leaders from several religious groups on the panel to discuss the religious diversity in happy valley where the lds church is the dominant religion.  the panel was made up of.... greg johnson (evangelical), director, standing together. father michael sciumbatto (catholic), st. francis of assisi, orem. elder donald j. butler, the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, utah south area. robert millet, department of religious education, brigham young university. scott mckinney, pastor, christ evangelical church, orem. caru das, krishna consciousness temple, spanish fork. brian davis (episcopalian), weber state university, pluralism project. janet riley, pastor, springville community presbyterian church. terek nosseir, islamic society of greater salt lake. imam mohammed shoaibuddin, islamic society of greater salt lake.  they all had some really good things to say. i was really impressed by caru das and robert millet (who i once did not like by association of joseph fielding mcckonkie).  i especially like when millet said (to paraphrase) "we need to check our agendas. if we were more bent on seeing others as friends instead of potential converts, this would be a much happier palce." i think his words can apply to more than just lds and those who aren't of this faith, but to all of us. i think we tend to look at others (in the church) as persons with different beliefs, values, etc instead of looking at them as friends. i am just as guilty as the next guy.  oh yeah, and i met and got this girls phone number at this thing tonight. hopefully i can get a date with her this weekend    donating blood   i went to the red cross today to donate some blood. (i don't believe in selling plasma. god gave me my life for free, what right do i have to turn around and sell it to others). so i get this male nurse that seemed lost and confused as he was doing everything. he ends up missing my vein and jerked the needle around in my arm to find it. that's not the best of feelings. so now my arm is bruised and i'm going to look like a junkie tomorrow. shouldn't i be blessed for doing a good deed?

       rated r   got in a nice little arguement after fhe last night about whether or not it is ok to see  urlLink the passion . if somebody chooses to not watch rated r movies, that's fine with me. i do think they are missing out on some very uplifting movies, but that's there decision. what bugs me is when they phrase their decision to not watch any rated r movies as a "i don't because i am righteous and do what is right" which implies that i am unrighteous in my decision and choosing to do what is wrong. i then jump up on my soapbox and tell them how i feel which pisses everyone off.  in  urlLink a deseret news article , robert millet (head of the religion department at byu) tells why he feels that watching this movie is not only ok, but something he should do. the article also say that some other lds leaders will be watching it with him, but does not say who.  so yeah, last night seven us went to pick up tickets for tomorrow night's show. i'll write up my thoughts after seeing it.

       shi** happens   a friend of mine was pretty down tonight because she just found out that her aunt was going to die of cancer by may. i took her our for a drive so that she could talk to me and vent out some of her feelings. she is trying to cope with it by believing that all the crap that happens in the world is allowed to happen for our own good. that god only allows evils if they produce a greater good.  that doesn't work for me. i have more of a  sh** happens  attidude. bad things just happed. some things are in my control. others are not. they are in control of other persons, nature, laws, and even god. if it's out of my control, there is no point in fretting about it or trying to figure out it's purpose. it in itself may have had no purpose. it just happened. god is not out of the picture though. he is there to pick us up. to help us recover from whatever hits us. he is hurt as he has to sit back and watch sh** happen, but he does what he can to turn that sh** to gold. this is not an ecuse to let evils happen. if it's in my control, it's my moral duty to do whatever i can to prevent them.  i still struggle with holding this attitude all of the time. i still let things put me down, but i guess that's just human.

      this is edith.  i have an old woman's name and an old woman's heart.  i am a contradiction. my family is nuts, but i think that is fairly normal - plus it makes the world go 'round with a better sense of humour.  i have a brain and i am not afraid to use it.  i am an artist and enjoy music and kids - because all of those three are, on a base level, honest. i think there is a difference between discipline and punishment. i believe that the world has lost all sense of manners and the idea of a "time and a place for everything".  i try to accept people without accepting their idiotic acts and behaviors, although i tend to give my opinions freely to anyone who will listen.  i think you can be a friend to someone who is completely different than yourself and i believe in rodney king's statement, "why can't we all just get along?"  people need to take the serious things seriously and let all the other things go, lighten up people! i don't have a web page nor do i know much about how this whole e-world works, i am more of a pencil and paint type of gal.  lastly, i think everyone needs a house at the beach, or wherever they feel their personal paradise is; and a good friend who is literally crazy to keep you sane.

       saturday night at area 51     last night turned out to be a blast. we first went to  urlLink club six , but they had some ultimate fighting going on upstairs, so the place was kind of empty. plus, it was a hip-hop club and mary was the only girl in our group, so with us other 4 guys, we wanted to go somewhere with some techno and break-beats. we ended up at the good ol' area 51. the last time i was there was a year ago with jeff. it was such a nice release. i swear, there is nothing better to get rid of stress and all that other crap that builds up in your head than taking it to the dance floor. anways, i took some pics...check them out  urlLink here .     community of christ   for my western religions class, i attended the  urlLink community of christ  (the former reorganized church of jesus christ of latter-day saints). it was kinda fun. there were only 10 people in their congregation. 4 couples who all had to be over 70 and 2 youngs girls maybe 6 and 8 years old (who looked extremely bored). luckily, chelan came with me. she helped me feel not so isolated. (it helps that she's really cute too). so yeah, they were very friendly and humble. the elder who did the sermon was obviously a lay fellow, but he did a pretty good job. the meeting was definately different. the funny thing was that when we were singing hymns, chelan and i sang better than all of them...and we had never sang or heard any of these songs before. they were almost two measures off from the music at times. the elder, in his sermon, even joked about how bad their singing was. another thing that i found was interesting was that contra the rumors i heard about them disbelieving the book of mormon, the elder spoke of christ visiting the americas as an actual event.    new song   "are you gonna live your life wonderin’ standing in the back lookin’ around? are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you’ve grown up or how you missed out? things are never gonna be the way you want. where's it gonna get you acting serious? things are never gonna be quite what you want. or even at 25, you gotta start sometime. i’m on my feet, i’m on the floor, i’m good to go. now all i need is just to hear a song i know. i wanna always feel like part of this was mine. i wanna fall in love tonight. are you gonna live your life standing in the back looking around? are you gonna waste your time? gotta make a move or you'll miss out. someone's gonna ask you what it’s all about. stick around nostalgia won't let you down. someone's gonna ask you what it’s all about. whatcha gonna have to say for yourself? i’m on my feet, i’m on the floor, i’m good to go. now all i need is just to hear a song i know. i wanna always feel like part of this was mine. i wanna fall in love tonight."  -praise chorus,  urlLink jimmy eat world

      i write up an entry. as i post it, i lose my internet connection and everything i wrote disappears into the hazy void. uggghhhhhh......   this weekend   this weekend started out great. derek came over from colorado. and then last night we went hottubbing with a bunch of friends, then we all came over ot my place for a movie and some pizza and stufs...  then things started going sour...  i went to the gym this morning, and when i came back, derek and all his things were gone. (he was supposed to be sticking around until monday). i called him and found out that he decided to pack up and go back to colorado. i guess being back here away from the army was making him kind of depressed. not that he missed the army, but being here reminded him how much he wanted to not be in active duty anymore. so he's gone...  and then i was supposed to go snowboarding with jake and derek on monday, but not derek is gone and jake wants to spend monday studying...  oh welll....  on the brightside, i actually found a group to go clubbing...yeah....maybe there is hope in this valley of ours....unfortunately not all my friends can make it...i'll prolly bring my cam and take some pics

       a  lesson from south park   "look, maybe us mormons do believe in crazy stories that make absolutely no sense, and maybe joseph smith did make it all up. but i have a great life, and a great family, and i have the book of mormon to thank for that. the truth is, i don’t care if joseph smith made it all up, because what the church teaches now is loving your family, being nice and helping people. all i ever did was try to be your friend, stan, but you’re so high and mighty you couldn’t look past my religion and just be my friend back. you’ve got a lot of growing up to do, buddy. suck my balls."  just finished watching this classic episode of south park with my buddy derek. the show has several obvious flaws, but nonetheless, it made me think of a few things. i have been a little too critical of many people here in happy valley. there are sincere people who, like harrisions, are truly happy and content with believing without a second thought. i need to respect that more. i know the show is a cartoon, but i think the harrisons are also a fine example of how mormons should live. not once did they mention the word of wisdom, or anything else that would have judged the people of southpark. instead, they constantly spoke (and acted) of taking care of the sick, poor, and needy. when people disagreed with them, they were fine with it. it did not change at all how they felt about their friends. they were loving people.

       and now a message from edith   the following came from an entry on my guestbook...  "if you put out the pretense of being so far above your fellow classmates and the rest of society (see "higher education"), by all means, PLEASE have the common decency to write like someone who, UGH!, graduated high school."  edith, whoever you are, this is my blog. it is not an english paper. i can write however the hell i want. i don't use capitalization here. i don't use very good sentence syntax very good. i don't shower and i spel things rong.  plus, it doesn't matter that i didn't graduate from highschool. so what if i dropped out of school after the 8th grade?    sarcasm in writing   sarcasm is hard to pull of when you are writing it. i have a hard enough time letting people know i am being sarcastic when i am speaking to them, an even much harder time when i'm writing it out. don't be offended edith, i love you and want you to visit more often    amazon.com   i love this thing. it's a blessing and a curse. just ordered three books tonight  urlLink the metaphysical club ,  urlLink socrates cafe , and  urlLink life of pi   do a kind thing, visit my  urlLink wish list , and buy me a book

       hierarchial revelation, authority, and opinion   it's late, but i just wanted to post a small theory that i developed while talking to a friend tonight. i think i discovered how i can have my cake and eat it too. it basically deals with the whole 'speaking for the lord' vs. 'his opinion' debate. does one have to pick one or the other when looking at the prophets words...or can one choose both. i believe he can do both by looking at his words as an opinionated interpretation of inspiration. here it is using president hinckley's "earing talk" as an example. i personally think that there is nothing wrong with a girl having her ear pierced twice or more, nothing wrong with a guy having a piercing, and nothing wrong with tattoos....as long as they are done tastefully. however, president hinckley said these should all be avoided. was he speaking as the lord's mouthpiece...or has his own? both. he was inspired and put that inspiration into his own words. let's say that god told the prophet to tell the youth to look tasteful. pres. hinckley (being a 90 year old man) has the opinion that for a girl to have more than one earring is distasteful. thus he interprets the inspiration as god saying that girls shouldn't have more than one earring.  basically....  inspiration + opinions > interpretation be tasteful + 2 rings is distateful > don't have 2 earrings  or another example... don't watch bad movies + all rated r movies are bad > don't watdh rated r movies  i think in many ways that this is the best way to understand scripture, the prophets, our own inspiration, and everything else like that  time for bed

       happy valley   once again, here comes another entry complaining about this little spot of heaven we call happy valley. my friend amber and i had a great discussion about this place. and then a few minutes later, my friend brooke came over and i got to hear from her the same grievances that i was previously venting. to some it up in one sentance, i guess i would say that i am getting sick of the ultra-conservative, pharisaic, and conformist mentality that exists here in happy valley. what do i mean by this? this is what i mean...   ultra-conservative  - this has several aspects. ---blind obedience. when the prophet has spoken, the thinking has been done. this never has, nor never will be a doctrine of the church. i could give quote after quote after quote from general authorities stating that this is not the case, but people here tend to believe just that. and what if i don't blindly follow? i'm a heretic --popular doctrine. another trend in the world of happy valley ultra-conservative life is the quick and reasonless acceptance of popular doctrine. elder so-and-so said it so it must be true. the scriptures tell us we are to search, ponder, and pray. it's almost heretical to ponder here. why pray about something elder so-and-so said, he's infallible. and what is there to search for. i have the quote from elder so-and-so right here. think differently about a doctrine...heresy. think differently about the nature of scripture/revelation...heresy. think differently about how the church hierarchy works...heresy. --slippery slope. this is the logical falllacy such that steps are unrecognized in differentiating two levels. x is sin, y may lead to this sin, so y is a sin also. example. pre-marital sex is a sin. you need to be alone with someone to have sex. therefore being alone with someone is a sin. nobody says it's a sin to be alone with someone!! you say. the stake presidency here has practically called it one. the same works with movies, dating, beverages, and almost every other potential lead to sin in happy valley   conformist  - as my friend amber said, (paraphrasing) the church teaches unity, not uniformity. here in happy valley, it's almost expected for us to come from the same cookie cutter as everyone else. being different is practically discouraged. thinking differently is a heresy. dressing differently is taboo. if you don't fall over in joy everytimes someon mentions they are going to watch the princess bride, something is seriously wrong with you. push your beliefs and morals on everyone else. in happy valley, everyone is the moral police. if you think someone is sinning, you let them know. be sure they know you disagree with what they did or are doing.    pharisees  - people here focus on the little do's and don't they create for themselves instead of the most important aspect of the gospel...love. happy valleyians measure righteousness by how many holes are in your ear, what you drink, what you watch, what you say, what you think, what calling you have, how often you do this-and-that in the organizational church. the measure that christ gave for righteousness condemned the nit-picking and focused on love. it's not how many holes are in your ears, it's how you treat others. it's not if you watch rated r movies, it's if you helped the poor. it's not about caffeine, but charity. love and don't condemn. the example for how we need to be was not made with the pharisees who did the small things and lived the perfect organizational life, but of the good samaritan. the one on the left. the guy looked down on by the others. the one who got down on his knees and took care of the downtrodden.  this was going to be much longer. i had a lot of specific things i wanted to vent about, but i got bored trying to remember all of them.  what am i to do? a part of me wants out of here. a part of me says i can do much good if i stay. a lot of it comes down to what happens with school. i at least know that i want out of this apartment complex.  there is plenty of good out here and plenty of people that i am sure agree with me. i just need to find them and have them help me with my crusade   finally... am i perfect? hell no. but i'm working on it

      i've been reading  urlLink five classics by truman madsen . it's definately a good read. of the five books in the collection, i have enjoyed his four essays on love the most. they are some interesting views on the different kinds of love we have and the love that god has for us. i just finished his chapter on forgiveness and love the paragraph near it's end...  "i once thought the atonement was over. of course, in one important sense it is. it happened, it is locked in the new testament era. jesus did say on the cross “it is finished.” but as i read the scriptures we cannot say that at that moment jesus’ suffering ceased forever. in one way his suffering has increased since the garden of gethsemane. that one way is obvious to any of us. after having paid that terrible price in an agony that is beyond our power to comprehend, he now must face the sorrow of god’s children being heartless, cold, calculating, and indifferent. he sees us with his own compassion and knows how desperately we need mercy; yet he has to bear the burden of knowing that the reason mercy is not operative in our lives is that we ourselves lock it out. “all eternity is pained” (d&c 38:12). all eternity is embodied in jesus christ, and even now he suffers. but i know of no place in scripture where he announces that because of that he is giving up, or that because our sins have become so extreme he will refuse forgiveness to the penitent. he promises that forgiveness is always there, and this is a joyous thought. but along with the joys both here and hereafter there will always be a measure of sorrow."  i've still got about fifty pages left which i'm going to try to get finished before i go to bed so that i can start on a new book tomorrow. i'm thinking either  urlLink evolution and mormonism  or  urlLink faster than the speed of light ...or maybe i'll pick something else out of my collection of unread books. i used to read at least a book every week or two, but with school and stufs, it takes almost a month for me to get through a book. the problem is that i still buy books at my old rate, so they are starting to build up. this is all  urlLink amazon 's fault. i need to prioritize my time better and plan some peaceful solitude to attack these books. bytheway,if you want to help out my library, you can buy me a book from  urlLink my wish-list . that would sure be a noble thing for you to do

       higher education?   so i missed a lot of the classes, didn't pay attention when i went, didn't study, and did  the homework an hour before the test. i figured i could slack on this test because they drop the lowest exam score. i get a 75%.  go to class yesterday and discover that students at uvsc are so stupid that the class average was 53%. the curve is bringing my grade up to a 96% or something like that. the really sad thing is that most of the kids in the class were complaining that they studied for hours and only managed to get the class average. i know that if i put in a quarter effort to study that i would have gotten at least a 90 on the test. i seriously hate these stupid level one generals at uvsc. ugghhhh...it feels like i'm in highschool.

         the logical problem of god's absolute foreknowledge and man's free-will   this is partially from an e-mail i wrote a month ago to respond to a critique of  urlLink my paper  from someone who wandered onto my site.  (p1) if a person has free-will in performing an action, then it must be actually possible for her to either (A) perform that action or (B) not perform that action. (def of libertarian free-will).  (p2) she cannot both A and B. (principle of exlude the middle). (p3) if god has absolute foreknowledge, then god knows and cannot be wrong in knowing that the person will either A or B. (def of absolute foreknowledge)  with these three in place, let's assume that god does have absolute foreknowledge and that he knows the person will A (perform the action)  (p4) god knows A (p3) (p5) A occuring is true (p3 and p4) (p6) it is impossible for B to happen (p5 and p2) (p7) therefore, if god has absolute foreknowldge, then there is only one possible option for the person to do (p5 and p6) (conclusion) god's absolute foreknowledge is not compatible with free will (p1, p3, p7)  here is the same thing with an example that can be swapped with any  choice  we can make  (p1) if jenna has free-will then it is both actually possible for her to either eat salad for dinner or not eat salad for dinner. (p2) she cannot both eat and not eat salad for dinner. (p3) if god has absolute foreknowledge, then god knows whether or not she will eat salad  (p4) god has absolute foreknowledge and knows jenna will eat salad for dinner (p3) (p5) then jenna will eat salad for dinner (p3 and p4) (p6) it is impossible for jenna to not eat salad (p5 and p2) (p7) there is only one possible thing for jenna to do (p5 and p6) (conclusion) god's absolute foreknowledge is not compatible with free will to eat or not eat salad(p1, p3, p7)

      put myself in a bad mood tonight. not only did i get gay-friended (see below), i couldn't for the life of me find a date to see a play at uvsc. so this bummed me out and so i really wanted to go clubbing, but nobody would come with me. ended up sitting on my butt with a few friends watching tv. i miss the days when i lived with mike and we'd go up to salt lake twice a month to go clubbing.  the night finished a little better with some birthday cake and chillin with some friends. and i found a small group to go clubbing tomorrow night. so that should be fun.  today, more than a couple people told me that they don't think i fit here in utah. i agree in a lot of ways. sometimes i feel like i don't fit in with the conservative crowd here. but at the same time, i like that part here. it keeps me in check. i think i jsut need to find more people like me out here. i know they exist. people like mike and megan. unfortunately mike moved out to logan and megan still feels uncomfortable hanging out with me.  a part of me wants to move out (jake thinks i'd be happier back east), but i really think i need to finish my undergrad work here in provo. my two favorite professors are big in the lds philosophy scene and i feel like i need to stay. as much as i hate happy valley at times, there is something special about it. i have more of a desire to get better grades now so that i can go back east for graduate school. if i can work things out, i'd love to go to notre dame, yale, cambridge, florida st, or unc-chapel hill which are all big schools for the philosophy of religion. oh well.... i might as well enjoy life right now

       gfs strikes again!    gfs (gay-friend-syndrome)  is when you like a girl. she seems to like you back. she enjoys hanging out, comes over just to see you, and says how much she enjoys your company. the problem is that that is all that she sees you as. you are her gay friend. she likes you, but she doesn't  like  you. yeah, i got hit again.   sbgfs (super-best-gay-friend-sydrome) . this has far worse symptoms. luckily i was diagnosed with gfs before it got any worse. sbgfs not only has all of the above symptoms, but this time she comes to you with all of her guy problems. she tells you who she likes and all that crap. not a good thing.  funny thing is, i'm not too sure if i even want any kind of serious relationship. in all reality, i don't. i guess there is just a bit of comfort when you start to like a girl and think that maybe she likes you back.  oh well...back to the drawing board

       christina aguilera   yeah, it was fun hanging out with her in park city, she wanted me big time. i really didn't care for her though. she's a dirty whore. so i told her to get lost.   tory, mel, logan   tory wanted me to go to logan this weekend with him, but i really don't feel like driving up there myself and being a third wheel with the both of them. jenna has a birthday dinner with her grandma on friday so she can't go, and megan just doesn't want to go. i'll prolly just say in town, go see a play friday night with jenna and hopefully go clubbing saturday night.   school   i'm doing great in my philosophy and religion classes. i aced my first logic exam on monday, and i think i'll do the same on my first deductive logic midterm next week. on the other hand, i bombed my first biology test last week with a nice 75%. it was just a bunch of definition memorizing, which i am not a big fan of. luckily, we get to drop our lowest exam. now that i know what the tests will be like, i'll know how to study for them better. i've got an astronomy test tomorrow which i have yet to study for. i shoul dhave plenty of time b4 the test to get some decent studying in though. in my philosophy and religion classes, i feel like i am in college, being challenged, and getting a good education. in my astronomy and biology classes, i feel like i'm in third grade with mr. garrison and mr. hat from south park. uggghhhhh. i guess this is what i get for playing around too much in high school

      well...this blasted cold is still bugging me. on the bright side, i didn't go to class today because of my sick status and had the opportunity to sit on the couch and watch byu's devotional. i have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed it. he spoke about something that i have ranted on several times in this blog of mine...helping the poor. i'm not going to rant on about it too much right now, but the scriptures clearly say that we are to be giving our excess to the poor, that if we know someone is suffering, it is our moral obligation to give to that person until have have no more to give. am i hypocritical? yes i am. i can and should be giving more. i use the excuse that i have debt i need to pay off, but i still find myself going out to eat, buying dvds, and spending my money elsewhere on simple luxuries. last december, i prolly donated about a total of over a hundred dollars to different things and it felt good. the highlight of my christmas was spending forty dollars in books at barnes and noble to donate to needy children. how much joy has my last pint of ben & jerry's icecream given me? did i feel this good buying myself a few dvds?

       a little bit of never-never land   just got back from toilet papering our bishopric's houses. it was a fun renewel of my youth, but once again i was dissapointed in the turn-out from this ward. hell, when we did this a couple years ago, we were trying to keep it to just a half-dozen of us and we had like 17 show up. tonight we had only 10 people go and 2 of them don't even live at  the crestwood . i understand if people were tired. it was late and that's a fine excuse, but when people don't want to go because it's  too juvenile  or it's  not their thing , then they can just suck my balls. none of my roommates even went. tom said he was tired, i don't know where logan went, and jake is just a pussy when it comes to anything. i need to talk the few fun people left here into moving out with me. off course it's juvenile! we're in college. we're single. live while you can.  i took plenty pics, but they turned out really dark. we're gonna see if we can touch them up and brighten them at all. i'll post 'em as soon as we do.

       bobby   it looks like my blog got a special visitor earlier tonight. here are a couple quotes from an e-mail he sent me today that i found quite funny.  "okay, i dont know if i am very `legal` to  to check out your site, but i did anyways, what are they going to do, send me home?"  "its kind of funny.  before the mission, I thought of you as a pretty wayward member"  wow. and there i was thinking i was a great example to my little brother...     why i believe   i felt like sharing what and why i believe in a non-philosophical way tonight. i dunno why. just because.  the book of mormon is scripture. i don't how historical it is. to me, that doesn't matter. it came from god. whenever i read from it (which i need to do more often), i learn something. it's as if the words speak to me personally. guidance. reassurance. comfort. condemnation. it's all there when i need it.  joseph smith was a prophet of god. how wonderful is the gospel that he restored! there is so much to it. simple enough for the child to understand, yet deep and challenging others. the teachings of family, marital unity, the nature of god, the nature of man, and so much more are so beautiful and powerful.  i am a child of god. sure, our physical bodies might have evolved from lower life forms, but we are so much more than our bodies. we are unique from all other animals. i have a spirit. i can reason. i am divine by nature and have the potential to be like my heavenly father.  jesus is my savior. he suffered physically and spiritually for me. he took upon my sins. all that crap that i have done, he placed those on himself and suffered the penalties for me. because of him, i will live again. because of him, i can be clean. because of him, i can have a marriage and family that extends the eternities.  how do i know this? it's not from some logical equation. i know it because there is something beyond my initital five senses that tell me it is true. it's more than just a feeling. it's a sense of knowing. when i read the scriptures, i know they come from god. when i pray, i know he is listening. when i repent, i know i am being cleansed. i can't explain how it all works, i just know that it does.

      Well  when all looks frail on a land that is run by the buddhists, one has to look on the heart of the person who sits infront of them, not the statue, not the shrine and not the wierd dangling things in front.  all people have an image they wish to protray, but it isnt until we get to the heart that we see the things wich they truly believe.   Dr. Marvin, I`m sailing! love and peace to ya brother, from your wompsack brother.  ps.  just dont tell the Pres on me, I will see ya in 3

       new song   toad the wet sprocket's  dulcinea  album is just incredible. it was a battle to decide which of it's song's to use this week. here it is...  "i spend too much time raiding windmills we go side by side laughing until it's right  there's something that you won't show waiting where the light goes take the darkest hour-break it open water to repair what we have broken …  i spend too much time seeking shelter world without end couldn't hold her  there's something that you won't show waiting where the light goes and anyway the wind blows it's all worth waiting for anyway the wind blows"  ---toad the wet sprocket, windmills  i hope the music doesn't inconvenience any of you. i'm looking into how to improve it. if you know anythin (or have a song idea) lemee know. the more comments i get, the cooler i am.

       bonfire in the snowing canyons     since the cabin trip ended up a bust, the bunch of us decided to head up to the canyons for a bonfire w/ some marshmallow and hotdog roasting. it was pretty fun, the fire was blazing hot and the wind/snow was freezing cold. rotating like a vertical rotisserie seemed to do the trick. anyways,  urlLink check out the pics here .

       ...and it's a bust   first megan, then jake, then tory and mel, then randii bail out. they all had good reasons though. except maybe jake, but his is understandable if his date is hot stufs. then i find out that the bishopric is being released tomorrow. so if i want to be there for that (which i do), then we'd have to be up by 6am tomorrow morning to clean the cabin and leave by 7am. i don't want another night of 3 hrs of sleep. maybe in 3 weeks we can get it to work.

       now i'm very tired   these last few days have been a killer. my sis-in-law called me just after 6 this morning to tend koji for a while. i love koji to death, but watching him so early in the morning does start to tire me out. i'm glad there is just one two year old to watch. megan just got hired to teach seven or so two year olds for preschool. that's gotta be tough, but i'm sure it'll be fun for her.  tomorrow night, a fairly large crew of us are going to head up to my folks' cabin to hang out for the night. it'll be fun, especially since derek is in town on leave from the reserves and tory and mel will be there as well.  i am so looking forward to sleeping in tomorrow. of course with my luck, something will wake me up and i won't be able to fall back asleep.

       levi!!      urlLink here  are some pictures of my new little nephew, just born yesterday. i might edit out some of the 'just popped out pictures' tomorrow when i'm not as tired.    summum     tory and i went to the  urlLink summum  pyramid today to check out their study hour and whatever else they do in there. wow.... now that was some wierd stufs. golden phalluses, mummified pets (all the animals in the photos are real mummies, the human was not real), some old cranky leader named 'corky', and a lot of odd folks. tory is writing an article for the daily universe and i'm doing a report on them for one of my reliigion classes. urlLink  the pictures can be found here . be warned though, there are some graphic statuettes in the photos. i'm not sure about the whole purpose of the golden dildos, but i'm sure there exists a very appropriate reason for having them. i'll hopefully have a few videos from the pyramid available soon.

(i thought it was jennica until i saw her name on her apartment's chore chart). she's pretty cool. levi is adorable. south park is funny. cafe rio is yummy. spring break is short. soup kitchen is full. mentoring is better than dishing out lunch.  lullaby  is a good book so far. i am tired.

       not needed   stopped by the provo soup kitchen today, but fortunately they don't need my help. i say fortunate for two reasons. one, it means that they have plenty of volunteers. two, they don't have volunteer opportunities that i was hoping they would have, such as reading with kids and stufs. they did refer me to the  urlLink united way of utah county  which has many opportunities to mentor, read with, and tutor children which is something i'm sure i'd enjoy.     no more song for the week   i checked out my blog and realized that the song's quality was really jacked up when i tried to make it streaming. so at least for this week, there will be no song. cartman will remain though. i know some of you find the music annoying, what about the rest of you? comment  let me know if i should keep it or rid it.    levi quinton ericson   i got to bed at two last night and was woken by my brother at four becuz my sis-in-law was going into labor and they needed me to watch my nephew koji as my new nephew was coming into the world. levi quinton ericson was born a healthy 7 pounds and 12 ounces at 8:29 this morning. i'll post some pics of him as soon as i get some.

       helping out the poor   Mosiah 4:16 "and also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish."  ever since i started working on my talk on saturday, my desire to help out the poor has multiplied. i look at all the things i have and realize that there is so much i can do. i decided that i need to get off my butt and get a job so that i can start doing more (that and my savings are almost depleted). i also just found out where  urlLink the local soup kitchen  is and am going to go there tomorrow to find out how i can do some regular volunteering there. it's amazing how blessed i am as a poor college student when compared to those who have so much less.

       substitutionary atonement    urlLink did christ pay for our sins?  here's an interesting paper looking at the atonement. the interesting question it brings up is... if christ actually paid the price for our sins, did god actually do any forgiving. while the paper is interesting and introduces an interesting  empathy theory , i did still found it problematic. especially considering sacrifice as a precursor of the atonement.    famous mormons   go to  urlLink famousmormons.net  for a list of famous mormons and former-mormons.

       whoops...   i forgot to write something yesterday. here's a little recap of some of my thoughts yesterday before i get back to finishing my talk for sacrament meeting today.    ward activity   went and saw  urlLink testaments  as a ward activity. yeah, i cried a little again. it's a great movie and does a wonderful job at helping you realize the love that the savior has for all of us individually.  our ward turnout was pathetic though. we are actually having ward activities, but nobody is coming to them. i had just seen  testaments  a couple months ago with jenna, so i wasn't in the most excited to go see it again, but i went to support the ward. another confirmation that it is time for me to move elsewhere.    sushi   mmmmmm..... found some more sushi buddies too.    taking lives   saw the  urlLink angelina jolie, ethan hawke, keifer sutherland flick . it was a fun movie, but left a lot of unanswered questions and loos ends.   back to finishing my talk...

       my counter arguement   there are a couple things that throw in a twist in my philosophical view of god's attributes.  the first is that i hope for a god that has more power than my mind is currently willing to give him. that hope leads me to believe that there is a way to make things all work out.  the second is that i have had experiences where i believe that the spirit has been able to let me foreknow future events, especially on my mission. i don't know how it was possible without infringing on other's free will, but it still seemed to happen for me

       attention all utah drivers (or those driving in utah)!!!   i had an hour between classes, so i thought i'd step into the computer lab to leave a message for some of you on the road yesterday. first of all,  a blinking yellow traffic light does not mean stop , it is equivalent to a yield sign. that means you don't stop, but you keep going..just be careful. if you suddenly slam your brakes, somebody will rear-end you. if the traffic light is blinking yellow, then the other direction perpendicular to you will have a red brinking light which is equivalent to a stop sign. while i'm at it. turn-abouts/round-abouts are not that hard to figure out. once again,  the yellow upside down yield sign does not mean stop . much like the blinking yellow light, it means proceed carefully yielding to the right of way. what is the right of way? if there are no other cars on the turnabout, you have the right of way. cars only come from the left. that means you look to your left, if nobody is there you have the right of way. just don't. no need to stop.  and to the queen bitch who was honking at me yesterday, i drive fast. prolly much faster than you. if i am driving stopping or driving slowly, i have a good reason to. don't ride up on my ass and don't honk at me. i stopped because there was a cross walk with crossing pedestrians. i drove slow because i was in a parking lot with kids walking around.   now that i have that out of the way...   the weather has been great lately. i am so ready for a warm spring and summer.

       the da vinci code    urlLink    this book just kicks butt. read it. i loved the symbolism it references throughout the book. definitely a book to add to your list.  urlLink    my next reading adventure will be  strangers in paradox: explorations in mormon theology     the sacred feminine in the book of mormon   reading the da vinci code reminded me of something in the book of mormon i found a year ago.  urlLink f.a.r.m.s.  had an article a year or so ago by daniel c petersen about asherah and lehi's dream. before and during nephi's time, the israelites believed that god had a consort/partner/wife named asherah. she was symbolized by a tree in the temple. (which was later removed with aaron's rod as the symbols became objects of worship.) petersen says how the tree in lehi's dream (usually said to represent jesus) could have been understood by nephi to represent not jesus, but mary.  some time after reading this, i noticed something making the connection even stronger that petersen did not mention. in 1 nephi 11, nephi describes the tree he sees as being having "beauty... yea,  exceeding of all beauty ," having " whiteness ," and being " precious above all ." Nephi asks what the interpretation of the tree was. what did he see next? he sees mary who he describes as " most beautiful, " " white ," and a virgin (moroni 9:9 says that chastity is " precious above all "). the tree doesn't represent jesus, but mary

      Deseret Book sucks. I (this is Tory) went to buy Temple and Cosmos, and they are charging almost $40 for the thing! Rip off. I wanna read the book, but not for $40 bucks, there are plently of other things cheaper and just as interesting. So if anyone reading this has the book and wants to sell it to me, let me know. I'll also maybe check out some used book stores. As for Deseret Book - Screw them.

      went to a private screening of   urlLink saints and soldiers   last night. this is the first lds film that is really a quality film. it's a story of a few soldiers in world war ii who escape a massacre and are trying to get to a us troop to give them some crucial information. definately go see this movie when it comes out this summer or fall. it was filmed with just $750,000 and has won 14 independant film festivals.  while it is a 'mormon' film, there is very little mormon about it. the main character is easily picked out by lds people to be mormon, but i doubt most anyone else would see him as that. the word 'mormon' is never used, nor is any other  mormonese  word. it kind of reminded me of richard winters character on  urlLink band of brothers  where he doesn't drink and the other soldiers are left trying to figure out why.  the ironic thing is, this wsa written, directed, produced, and (mostly) acted by lds actors, but the  urlLink mpaa  gave them an 'r' rating which was totally undeserved. what little faith i had in the rating system just went down the drain last night. they are trying to get the rating reduced, but said they will not cut anything out. it was easily a pg-13 movie. if some lds wll still refuse to see this movie because of it's rating, that would be extremely unfortunate, because this movie has absolutely nothing offensive, too violent, vulgar, or gratuitous and i would take almost any child to see it.  it will be very interesting to see how the  happy valley  community reacts to this movie and it's rating.

       i think i have mono   ok i really don't, but i sure have been hella tired this week. i think having 5 mid-terms in a week is doing it to me. last night, maggie was doing homework on my computer and i was struggling staying awake around 10 pm and these last few days i have found myself telling and asking people the same things over and over again as well as always thinking that the time was 1/2 hr earlier than it reall was. time for a nap...

       where to move?   went out again with megan to find a new apartment complex to move to. so far, omni and raintree seem to be the winners. omni is a little cheaper and has a washer and dryer. raintree has nice big rooms and a nice atmosphere, but will cost a little more. hmmmmmm...

       outstanding student?   i found out today that i am one of thirteen nominees for the  outstanding student award  for the philosophy department at uvsc. i'm not exactly sure what that is though, but it'll look good on a resume or vitae. unfortunately, i need to turn in a transcript and vitae to the head of the department. that'll screw me over. it was cool though, cuz it was dennis potter who nominated me and he's totally my favorite professor. i wonder how many students are in the department. being one of thirteen of 15 wouldn't be all that great ;)

       hmmmmm   once again i don't have much to right about write now. in my western religions, we spent most the day discussing  the passion  and rated r movies. it was most of the same ol' stufs i've said before though. i'm only about 30 pages into the da vinci code so far, but i'm getting excited to really get into that so i can discuss it with those who have read it. overall, life is good. got a date tonight. we'll see how that goes. and i get to babysit my little buddy koji this afternoon!   feel free to rant on here with whatever you want to say... just go to   urlLink http://blogger.com  login: mayhemguest password: password

       the da vinci code    urlLink    i finished  socrates cafe  rather quick. it would be a good book for someone who has little experience with philosophy, but it may seem rather simple for those with some experience.  i am now i'm reading  the da vinci code   urlLink    which has been recommended to me by a few friends. i guess i'll see what all the hype is. megan, who pretty much shares all the same interests with me liked it a lot, so i'm guessing i will too

       blah...   tonight turned into a bust of sorts. i worked until 9:30 and was gonna go to a party here in raintree with some friends, but nobody was really up to it and we bailed after a few minutes. it would have been better if we knew more people here, but having just moved in we haven't gotten to know any body yet. that'll change as we start going to our ward and stufs...  so i'm here in raintree... finally all out of  the crestwood !! it's nice to be somewhere different and still retain the few friends from there that i care about.  life is really good. sure there are some of the same struggles, but there is really no point in stressing over them. just gotta accept that shit happens and move on.  so i got bobby moving in with me, hyrum (my other new roommate) seems pretty cool. joe and jake are next door and megan isn't too far away. things have been a blast with everyone. megan's awesome as always. she bought me maxim's hot 100 issue to thank me for picking her up from the airport (how cool is that!). work is going good. i actually got a paycheck today. school went pretty good i think. i'll know for sure in the next few days as my grades get posted. blah blah blah...  i feel like by blogs have been really shallow lately. i don't know if there is nothing about my feelings to write about... or if i just don't want to share them with anyone. prolly the latter  maybe as school starts up again and i get more relaxed (do those two go together. school and relaxation?) i'll start flowing more with my thoughts  i guess i'll just read tonight and catch some early sleep for tomorrow.

       honestly now... do we really need stars?   astronomy is finally done with. i used to love the stuff, when i was little i wanted to be an astronomer and astronaut. not anymore.  i'm about all moved into my new place, just have my computer, stereo, bed stufs, and dishes to move. then it's good-bye crestwood.  tiring past few days.  my posts lately have mostly been single sentances and sentance fragments. when i get recharged and have more time i'll vent, philosophy, rant, dream, and all that other crap more.  i want some cuddling... and stufs.

       tiring...   i had a 7am  logical thinking  final yesterday and then spent the rest of the day working on my summum powerpoint presentation for my  western religions  class (with a little break to pick up megan from the airport).  woke up today at 6 and studied until my  western religions  final at 9. i've spent most of the day moving my things to my new apartment. it would have gone by faster if some dumbass would move his things out of my enw place. i only have a few things left now. tonight i've gotta study for a bit, 24, and then more studying for my  astronomy  final... unless, of course, i can find something else i'd rather do (which is just about anything).

       failure   i'm driving to draper this afternoon for bobby's homecoming talk and along side the freeway i see a mother and daughter who look like they need some help. they're both dressed in their sunday dresses attempting to change a flat tire on their mini-van. a mini angel version of me appears on my left shoulder and tells me to pull over and help them out. a mini devil version of me then pops up on my right shoulder and reminds me that if i pull over and help, i'll prolly be late for the meeting. surely somebody else will give them a hand. i flick the angel off my left shoulder and continue driving...  matthew 25:42 " for i was pulled over with a flat tire and ye gave me no help..." 25:44 "then shall they answer him saying, lord, when saw we thee pulled over with a flat tire... and did not give thee help?" 25:45 "then shall he answer them, saying, verily i say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me."

       maybe i don't want to graduate   chris graduated today (congrats bro!), but now i dunno if i want to graduate. that ceremony was sooooooooooo loooooooooooooong. of course, i'll still graduate. i just won't invite anyone to the ceremony (if i even go myself).  one good thing about it was that i had plenty of time to finish reading  invisible monsters . to sum it up, the book was twisted, twisted, twisted, and friggin awesome. another great palahniuk. much like lullaby, it starts off confusing as hell, but all comes together in the end like a jigsaw puzzle. much like  lullaby  the timeline is always jumping around. but instead of jumping between chapters, each paragraph practically takes place at a different spot on the timeline, but somehow makes sense. i would definitely recommend it if you can handle something so twisted, morbid, insightful, exciting, and hilarious.  i'm not sure what i'll read next. it'll prolly be  life of pi  or  conversations with god . i'm not sure which though. throw in your votes  my last several posts have been small and scarce. that's because i've been so gosh dang tired lately (note the mormon swear words). with work, finals, and a roommate who vacuums at 7am i haven't gotten much sleep. i should hopefully catch up this weekend.

       happy valley   here's another post about happy valley. a different take on it this time.  urlLink for a while i really started to hate living here , but lately i have really been enjoying it out here. i'm not saying that i want to spend the rest of my life here. i'm just saying that i'm in no hurry to get my butt out of happy valley as i was before. the people here in happy valley really haven't changed and i really haven't changed either.. at least i don't think i have. or perhaps i have changed. for a while i was all about people here accepting me more for who i was, but maybe the real problem was for me to accept people here for who they are. maybe it's just now that i feel like i have met a substantial group of friends who like me for who i am and appreciate my quirks. i dunno what the deal is. i do know that i'm enjoying my time out here lately and am happy for the most part.

       islam, israel, and how america shoots themselves in the foot   we're discussing islam and israel in my western religions class today. i have a little greater understanding of why so many arab nations don't like us all that much. american policy has really screwed them over some. 1st we kick the palestinians out of their homes and farms and give them away to a group of polish jews. 2nd we fund israel's army. 3rd we side with israel in most of their confilcts. 4th we look away when israel screw over the palestinians.  i'm not saying that we deserve what has happened, just that we are not blameless victims in all of this. the more we cry innocence and retaliate, the worse things are going to get    school   byu is finishing up this week, but uvsc still has 1 1/2 weeks left. they'll be starting the next semester the same time we begin our finals! i am so looking for this semester (especially astronomy) to be finished.

       and then it was today   been kind of a boring day. went to class until 2 then pretty much did nothing besides a short nap. compusa still hasn't recieved my drug test info, so i won't be starting until at least wednesday now. which is fine becuz i have some studying i need to tomorrow. my refund still hasn't come in yet. hopefully it'll be deposited tomorrow.  fhe tonight had a surprising outcome. a lot more people showed than i expected and it turned out rather fun even though nothing was really planned. bishop meeks(sp?) is a pretty cool guy. he was there at my final council and got to see me ball my eyes out with happiness. i'm sure that's why i'm one of the few whose name he knows  sara is a really cool girl. i'm glad megan's got a roommate that actually wants to go out and be social and stufs. i just wish i felt more comfortable with being able to drop by and hang out like i can with other apartments

       happy easter i guess   so megan and i took koji to the zoo yesterday. it was a lot of fun. koji got really excited with lots of the animals. he especially liked the monkeys and had a big grin on his face when he first saw them. we're driving back to provo and just couple blocks away from by brother's when my car just dies. we were able to get it working again somehow... just enough for it to break down again on the way back to my apartment. at least it didn't break down in salt lake. that would have been a little too much adventure for me. i really hope it doesn't cost much to fix. it seems like when life is getting good, god uses my car to make sure i don't get too happy.  today is easter, but it feels no different than any other day. no easter dinner with the fam. no candy. no eggs. just a regular sunday. we had a stake easter sacrament meeting. it was nice and short. i didn't quite pay attention to the talks too much. i was busy reading some chapters from the book of mormon, matthew's account of jesus's final days, and writing in my journal. the closing hymn was "i know that my redeemer lives". i choked up while singing the last verse. how awesome it is to have a testimony of my savior. to know that he suffered for me and lives today.  so the rest of today has been pretty empty so far. just relaxed and had some easter ramen. yay :/  oh yeah, and maggie gave me a ride to my parents house so i could steal their car for a while. they are in japan picking up bobby right now. it's nice to have friends you know you can turn to for help. thanks mags :)

"and i doubt - that i will ever find out - if there's a way to get out - of feeling all alone - cause lately - i've been thinking – maybe - that no one's going to save me - i'll do it on my own.....” ---never there  i'm blasting  urlLink hoobastank  tonight, singing along as best i could (which prolly isn't very good) and i realize  urlLink that they have some really kick-ass lyrics . almost as good urlLink  linkin park's lyrics , just not as depressing.

       refreshing   i really felt like i needed to read my patriarchal blessing tonight, but i couldn't find it anywhere. for some reason, these last few days have been kind of a rut for me (i'm not sure why. everything, for the most part, is going great). my dad has a copy of my blessing on his computer, so i figured it would be nice to hop in my car, blast some music, and drive really fast to draper. i dunno what it was, but i felt great and refreshed by the time i got there.    it was bound to happen sooner or later...     yeah, that's right. most of my friends are surprised that i haven't gotten any tickets when they are riding with me. i wasn't so lucky tonight. 93 mph in a 65. luckily the cop was nice and dropped it to 85 mph so that i can clear it off with some traffic school. it didn't bum me out at all though, for some reason it just refreshed me even more. i'll tell you one thing though. as soon as those lights start flashing behind you, the prayers start flying.    other good news   i had my 2nd interview today, and assumming i pass my drug test (which should happen now that i have been heroin-free for six months), i should be starting work with compusa on monday or tuesday. it's a relief to finally have a job again. i wonder if i'm still on seagull's payroll? i did my taxes tonight as well and it looks like i'll be getting six hundred dollars refunded to me this year. that'll be kind of nice.  things are going really good for me. as i said above, i was kind of in a rut for a few days. i wasn't sure why, but i think it's all over now. perhaps it was the cloudy weather, or maybe sitting on my lazy but without a job finally caught up with me. hopefully the weather is better on saturday. i was telling koji about all the animals he is going to see at the zoo and he got so excited. he's gonna love it.

       round three   just nice stuff this time :)  -thanks for your prayers -you are an awesome ninja -thanks for caring -i'm glad i've been able to get to know you more -sorry if i get short with you, you're fun to live with -thanks for always being excited to see me and talk with me -come over anytime to hang and cuddle -we don't always agree, but it's nice to have someone who digs theology like i do -we have different attitudes, but that's a good thing. the world would be messed if everyone were juvenile like me -there is nobody i'd rather have deep conversations with than you -thanks for coming to me as a friend when i felt i was alone -(something nice about myself that i can't think of)  being nice feels a lot better than being mean    loyd's life update   things are going really good right now. i'm really happy and excited about school, relationships, and the spiritual.  school is going really good right now. i know i say this a lot, but it's so much better when i am studying something i love (and am apparently good at). i think i'll be getting a's in my four philosophy and religion classes. astronomy isn't going to be as good. i prolly won't be getting the 4.0 i thought i was going to be able ot achieve.  i feel so much more social now. i've got plenty of friends and people who come over to chill and plenty others where i feel totally comfortable going to chill. i know i haven't written much about my friendship with megan lately. at least not overtly. that's mostly cuz she reads this (hi megan ;) ). i really cherish that friendship. we're just so much alike with the same interests and all. i do kinda miss our deep, late night conversations we used to have. maggie has been a really great friend too. (hi maggie). too bad she's heading home for the summer.  spiritually, i'm actually really trying to read the book of mormon everynight (i've gone three nights in a row) and am planning to go to the temple sometime this week with tory. my testimony has grown a lot lately. when i pray now, i feel like i'm really having a conversation with god. some maay think this blasphemous, but i pray now as if god were sitting next to me and was my buddy. i don't use all the 'thees' and 'thous'. i just talk normal. it's cool. i really feel like i'm having a two-way conversation with him. it gives me hope. i don't always believe the same as others, but there is something inside that let's me know what is important to know.  i really need to go get myself a job right now. i've been slacking lately and that's not good. i just hate looking for work, maybe it's the inner shyness in me or maybe it's the fear of having a job i don't really enjoy. i really feel like a lazy slacker though. i get bored a lot now and start to bug others to break the boredom. enough talking about it though, time for more doing.

       round two.   mostly the same people. different order. maybe a little nicer this time... or maybe not  -it's about time someone gets the girl -sometimes you seem almost too nice that it seems fake. i know it's not, but it can seem that way. -you're a really caring person and always seem to be thinking of others -slut -maybe i judge too much. not everyone is like me. -sometimes i just want to hold you -thanks for giving me a better place to live. -when i'm in my room and i've got music playing, i can't hear you from the kitchen/lcouches. how many times do i have to tell you? -you're one of the few friends that i think i'll keep in touch with in the semi-distant future -forget your missionary and give it a chance -a lot of people are disgusted by you. tone it down and let people know who you are. -you've got what it takes to be an arrogant ass, but you are the total opposite. -get off your lazy butt and release another album -get off your lazy butt and get a job

       the gloves are coming off   so yeah, i don't write my thoughts/feelings about specific people on here anymore because too many people read this thing, but now my gloves are coming off. that's right. there is no holding back anymore. here's what i think about all you guys. i'll just not use any names to protect the innocent (me).  -you're nice, but i'm seriously scared that you are going to freak out all of the sudden and start killing people. -why do you have to be so loud all of the time? tone it down a few decibels. and watch how you say things to my friend. just because you can't control yourself gives you no right to say crap like that. -yeah, you really pissed me off a while back, but i forgive you. -you're one of the few people in this complex that i have always felt comfortable going to, thanks. -i think you and you would look great together. -you haven't got a mean bone in your body. -you always have this happy glow about you. seeing you hurt (which wasn't fun) made me realize that you are human too. -i know you think what i'm doing is stupid. but hell, this is how i feel and i can't change that. -you're prolly the greatest and  bestest  friend i have had. thanks. -i finally beat your best score on snood. -you need to get out more and let people realize how great and fun you are. enough excuses. -for some reason, i want some action from you. -i look up to you, not because you are taller than me though. -so you think i'm immature? ...well suck my balls.  i could go on for days with these things, especially if i went to the past. this will do for now. i hope i don't seem to critical or prideful with any of these. $5 and a carton of whoppers to anyone who can guess who all these belong to.

       eternal sunshine of the spotless mind   ""i have done that," says my memory. "i cannot have done that" -- says my pride, and remains adamant. at last -- memory yields." ~ friedrich wilhelm nietzsche  went and saw  urlLink eternal sunshine  tonight. def-def-def-definitely would recommend it. in the movie, they used some other quote of nietsche about memories, but i like the above one much better. so yeah, this movie really gets you thinking. if you could erase something or someone from your memory what would it be?  coincidently, megan and i were talking early today and i mentioned to her how most of the last year has become a blur to me. it's kind of funny what our memories choose to keep and clear. a year ago, there was some crap i wanted cleared. things that i regretted and wished were no more. it's amazing how the atonement does that kind of thing. those things are not a part of my life anymore and it's almost as if they never were.  is there anything i would want cleared from my memory? not anymore. there have been times that i have wanted to forget things, but looking back, i am glad that those things remain. what is kind of odd is often times, the memories i wanted cleared were the good memories. i guess that's because it's the good memories that can hurt the most. when my dog died, it was the good memories that made me sad, that made me miss her. those were the memories that hurt. as i said goodbye to her the night before we put her to sleep, it was the memories of laying in the park, watching her run through the grass that hurt, not the memories of chasing her through the neighborhood late at night before i'm about to go to sleep.  if you look back to the beginning of this blog, you can see that my last year was not the best of years. i found myself alone and feeling friendless. i wanted to forget the good times. to forget my friends. to forget my happy thought. i'm glad that i didn't. those are the things that i remember now. the fun times in the nook. basketball in the park. my car breaking down on the way to the cabin. chad's boat at deer creek. endless late night talking with megan. iceburg. vegas trip. the list goes on. those are the things that remain. why the hell would i want to forget stuff like that?  i think i'm blabbing now. my english sucks in this entry (actually it sucks is most my posts). i don't even know what the point of this was now. i'm glad i have memories. with them, i can forge my future with things i want to change and work for things i want to live again.

       bush signs fetus-protection bill    urlLink bush signed the unborne victims of violence act today  that makes it a federal crime to harm a fetus during an attack of a pregnant woman. murdering a pregnant woman would then be considered a double-homicide. the bill only applies to federal crimes, but is a pretty important bill as it legally defines an unborne fetus as a person with rights. a fine step to a ban on abortion in the next few years.

         went up to my parents cabin for my birthday friday night. it was a lot of fun. i think we had a total of 18 people there for it.  urlLink check out the pics here .    dares   we played some silent football with some random dares. check out ths vids below.   urlLink rachel licking my eyeball   urlLink sara thinks she's a horse   urlLink rachel's a little teapot   urlLink hyrum tasting mary's ear   urlLink erotic tummy ice massage   urlLink stephen chills his balls     good times   on the wrapping for the gift she got me (some books), megan wrote a long list of inside jokes and memories that the both of us have shared as we have known eachother the last year. she's seriously the most awesome, beautiful, and bestest friend ever.    walk with god   while my friends were watching a movie, i decided to step outside for a bit. the snowing had stopped and the clouds opened up to show the stars and the moon outside. every now and then, i like to be alone and pray/talk with god as if he were right next to me, listening and quietely responding. i think turning 25 kinda hit me funny. it wasn't the  "i'm still single" thing that tends to hit guys out here when they get older. i really don't think about that. it'll happen when it happens and i don't think i'm ready for it to happen. for me it was more that i kinda felt like i haven't done a whole lot with my life lately, that i'm doing nothing. so i walked and talked with god for a half-hour or so. told him how i felt, where i struggled,  and stufs . while walking back i had a strong feeling of how blessed i am right now in my life. the wonderful friends i have, my family, and everything else that surrounds me.

      a year ago, i was in a situtation that left me feeling pretty different than most everyone else here in happy valley. there were a few special friends that understood me and i felt normal just the same around them, but with others... they didn't judge me or anything... most of them didn't even know, i felt different and like an outsider nonetheless. to cope with this, i took pride in being different. this was especially true the last few months of it. most of my close friends had moved out or temporarily parted ways. this left me feeling really different and quite alone.  as i said, to cope with this, i began to glorify myself as being different. nothing outward, mostly just inside. a few months later and my ordeal was over. i wasn't all that different anymore. the desire to be different still remained. i had to act out, brag about, and exagerate my differences in order to remain the unique snowflake i wanted to be. the problem was, as people got to know and accept me... i had to try harder to be different.  i'm more out going and happier now, but i think that's more of a result of finishing what i went through. for much of it, i don't like what i've become. i noticed this a lot after i moved. i also really noticed this a month or so ago when i first met with sara. she wanted to know who loyd was and i set out to paint a picture of this out-there freak. in some ways i feel like i'm a caricature of this image i set out to be. a person who i really don't care for. i don't want to be the same as anyone. i don't want to be different. i just want to be me.  another great help in making me realize this were some pretty straight-forward words from someone i trust, who loves me, had seen this change, and could say it without hurting me. thanks.

      guido orefice  watched   urlLink life is beautiful   tonight with some friends. this movie was just awesome and won it's spot in my favorites list. guido is just awesome. almost always optimistic, he tries his hardest to lift the spirits of his wife and son as they go through the tragic events of the holocaust. if he weren't so good at being happy, i would have bawled my eyes out. the movie is sad, but happy at the same time. anyone and everyone should see this.

      jeez... i'm just all full of posts right now.  got a new calling today... war executive secretary.. again...  it's funny how the lord will give you the calling that you least want. just minutes before i got my calling, i mentioned to a friend that i absolutely did not want that calling. (the same thing happened with my mission call to hawaii). when they told me which calling they wanted me to serve, i didn't know what to say. i almost said no, but i knew i would hate myself if i did. i told the high counselor that i needed some time to pray about it. to get my heart  and mind in the right setting. i didn't want to accept (and especially sustained) unless i was fully into it. i prayed most of sacrament meeting and met with the bish to discuss what he would require. i feel good about it now.

      saw  urlLink this fine flick  a few days ago. paris (aka legolas (aka orlando bloom)) is a total wuss through most of the whole movie. hector (aka the hulk (aka delta stud in  blackhawk down  (aka eric bana))) is just the perfect good guy. achilles (aka tyler durden (aka a whole lotta other great characters (aka brad pitt))) just kicks ass. helen (aka some chick) never smiles. besides hector, there are no real heroes. no real good guy. no real bad guys. just tragic war with a tragic ending. great movie though.  if you've seen the movie,  urlLink check out the fifteen minute version here  for some good laughs.

      i finished reading  urlLink the metaphysical club  today. it was much more interesting than i thought it would be. rather than being a story of holmes, james, pierce, and dewey and their influence on american thought, the book covers dozens of early intellectuals, their many intertwinings, and their infulence and reaction to racism, freedom of thought, politics in economy, education, and government. i'd recommend it to any nerd like me.   urlLink    my next reading is to finish stephen king's  the drawing of three  which i started a while back, but got busy with school and never finished reading.

      now that i've got all this time on my hand, i decided that i'm going to spend at least 2 hours every weekday studying philosophy (which is fun for me anyways). hopefully, this will keep my brain from totally dying before classes start again in a month.  i think i'll begin by finishing off my two logic books that we didn't finish last semester.

      i've got some time on my hands, so here are some more thoughts.   suicide   one of my friends killed himself in highschool. he had some imbalances going on and he took his own life. are people who kill themselves held accountable for their actions? some people say that they were under such mental and emotional anguish that they should be held accountable. perhaps this is the case for some. i dunno. i haven't killed myself (obviously) so i don't know how it is. a full pardon seems to be a bit easy though. to me it seems that there is some selfishness involved with suicides. a parent leaving their children and loved ones behind. a teenager doing it for revenge. or someone who just didn't want to tough it up. again, i don't know what it's like. i'm sure it's different for everyone. i just think granting them all a full pardon for murdering themselves seems a bit too easy.   death penalty   beyond a few rare cases, the death penalty is morally wrong. just because someone has taken another's life gives us no right to take their life. jesus taught us to turn the other cheek. not to bitch-slap them right back.   but it's in the old testament!  so are a lot of other laws that jesus did away with. he did away with an-eye-for-an-eye (which was actually a law concerning what the most could be done as punishment, not as a law on what to do) and replaced it with forgiveness and love.   it costs too much to hold them in prison for life!  from my understanding and reading, because of the appeal process, it actually costs more to put a person to death than it does ot hold them in a life sentance. even if it did save money, since when has saving a buck been an excuse to kill someone. sounds a bit like what cain learned to make himself  master mahan , the ability to kill for persona gain.   it deters crime!  does the thought "i'll only get a life sentance instead of the death-penalty" ever cross the mind of someone before he kills someone? studies have shown that violent crimes increase in places where capital punishment is installed and decreases where it is stopped. rather than detering crime, capital punishment teaches a lesser value of the life of a person. it teaches that it's ok to kill.   what are the few cases?  a few thousand years ago, there were no such things as maximum security prisons. today it is (for the most part) feasible to keep prisoners in a life sentance without endangering others. however, there are some, such as the dahmers, mcveighs, and (the fictional) lechters that our so dangerous that nobody is safe around them. these, i believe, can be subject to the death penalty. i also think that those who kill in attempts to escape incarceration could be subject to capital punishment.

      no. if we knew who our parents were going to be in the pre-existance, then our parents getting together and doing the naughty was destined and inevitable. that might sound fine for most of us, but if this were true, then for some persons it was necessary from the beginning that they be conceived by rape, incest, and pre-marital sex (or all of the above).  this denial leads to some other things as well. if our parents were not foreknown, then our pre-mortal spirits did not resemble our mortal bodies. our genetics control how we look. we get our genes from our parents, blah blah blah, you can figure out the rest. i guess you could say that there are enough spirit persons, that god can match spirits to their genetic match at conception, but that just seems unlikely.  what about jesus appearing to the brother of jared? i dunno. maybe since god knew jesus would be his son, he knew already how he would look. this brings up another question though. if jesus were also the genetic son of mary, how could jesus look  exactly  like his father? i guess that maybe mary could have been the female genetic match of god the father, or that the genes worked together just perfectly to make the father and son identical. or maybe jesus is a genetic clone of his father? sure it sounds like science fiction, but doesn't two beings descending from the sky in a pillar of light (js first vision) sound a bit like science fiction.

      maggie's aunt passed away last week from cancer. she (maggie, not her aunt) asked me last night how i felt about death. even though i had a brief semi-goth period in highschool and i dressed up gothic for fun some nights, i was never one to dwell on it. depression and suffering are much more fun to fill your mind with ;). besides a month in highschool where three friends died (suicide, illness, climbing accident) and a pair of dead dogs, i've never really had to face it. all my family on my dad's side is still alive, both my mom's parents have passed, but having never really known them, it affected me little. so ayways, here are my thoughts...   death just happens   i think the main way i look at death is pretty much my  shit happens  view on life. i don't think god necessarily plans our deaths. just like everything else in our lives, the timing of our passing is not certain. we just die. some people die too young, others live too long. we aren't born with our time of death already set. some deaths happen by accidents, others we bring on ourselves with disease, and i think that others have god's hand in happening (i.e. ro relieve suffering).   is death good?   yes and no. if someone is suffering from a terminal disease or something similar, i think death is can be a good thing. if someone is so old that they cannot care for themselves and are pretty much a burden on everyone around them, then death can be both a blessing to them and their loved ones. because of this, i think euthanizing the terminally ill and elderly can be moral and should be allowed.   death can really suck too   for the loved ones of those who have died, death usually sucks. even with the realizing that their suffering is over, it can and should be painful to have them gone. even worse is for those who die too young. car accidents, suicide, disease, and other things can take the lives of persons who had so much more to offer in the world. it can be a sudden loss for the loved ones and a life left unfulfilled for those who die. sure, they might be in a  better place , or have a different mission to fulfill, but if that were so, then we should all be dying sooner. just like my stubbed toe, deaths can just happen without any purpose. it sucks. it's unexpected. it hurts a lot. god did not plan it. it's just up to us on how we are going to deal with it.   aint jesus the coolest?   as hard at it is, at least we can have the hope that it isn't the end.   what about?   some people find relief in believing that death is something planned and foreknown by god. perhaps it's because i don't believe in god's absolute foreknowledge... i just don't see how it can help. if it were true, i'd find myself constantly searching for why this had to happen and i'd prolly find myself unimpressed with the answers. i'd hate to believe that the timing of my death was certain and that i ultimately had no control on how or when it would happen.

      wow... in priesthood today, we were talking about being examples. after 3 or 4 minutes, i was as bored as it gets. usually, i'm pretty good and getting a discussion going, but there was just nothing to say. all i could do was look out the window and think of the mexican fiesta meal i was going to be eating later...   i've been kinda thinking i should take an institute class, but i don't want to get bored in there either. it would be a good fill of some of my empty time i have during the day

      went and saw  urlLink van helsing  tonight with some friends. it's a fun movie. the special effects and cgi are great and the action was non stop. not too many one-liners either. the story was a little forced and much of it concerning van helsing's past was pointless and dissapointing. the romance also seemed forced.  overall it was a fun action-flick. now if van helsing had a whip... then it would have been  urlLink my favorite video game  come to life.

      while hyrum and i were out talking with some girls tonight, i came to the realization that i've been a lousy brother lately. before bobby got home, i thought all my childish name calling and such would be over when he returned. not quite. it started right up when he got off the plane. i'm not sure why i'm doing it. chris and i never had this problem when i returned. perhaps it's my way to ensure my position as the alpha brother and he as the omega brother. perhaps i just enjoyed having him back so much that i returned to how we used to act with eachother. or maybe i've forgotten how it is to be a recently returned missionary trying to adapt with the real world again and have let myself become frustrated as he is trying to adapt (which is he doing far better than many rms i have known). whatever the reason is, i'm going to be a better big brother now.

      wow. absolutely loved this book. it's the (true?) story of a 16 year old boy who's lost at sea in a lifeboat for seven months. as i have said previously, i was kinda skeptical when i bought this book, but a few pages into it the main character, piscine (pi) patel, had me hooked. i would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone.  urlLink    next up is  the metaphysical club: a story of ideas in america  which tells of four great american thinkers: holmes, james, pierce, and dewey and how their ideas changed the way we think today

      we were going over mosiah 9 today in sunday school and well.... my views of zeniff changed a lot. i used to think he was this great king, but now i see him as over-zealous, prideful king who let his idea of manifest destiny (a serious problem in all religious-based land arguements) lead his people to near-destruction. no wonder his son noah turned out to be such a bitch.  vs 1. zeniff is a spy trying to regain a land the nephite's hadn't occupied for almost a hundred years. he realizes that the lamanites aren't all that bad. he thinks it best not to kill them.  vs 2. zeniff decides to kill a lot of his army instead.  vss 3-5. after killing eachother, zeniff and his left-over army have a power trip and decide they are going to  politely  ask for the land  vss 6,7. the lamanites just get up and kindly give up their land to zeniff. honestly now... would thye just give it up cuz zeniff asked. no. zeniff was backed with a blood-thirsty army who had just finished killing their own brothers, sons, and fathers. who would stay and fight an army like that? (hmm reminds me of some palestinians who nicely gave their homes and lands to foreign jews who were backed with a few army's who had just finished kicking some trash)  vss 8,9. they start using the land and they prosper. obvious signs of karma. god must be really pleased with them.  vss 10,11. how dare the lamanites wish to have their land back which they were kicked out of. (how dare the palestinians wish to have their homes back in israel)  vs 12. very typical racist language.  vss 13-16. this is what happens when you kick people out of their homes. they don't like it a whole lot.  vss 17-19. manifest destiny at work. it's our god-given land. we won, therefore we are more righteous than you lazy lamanites. (replace lamanites with palestinians)  no wonder zeniff's son noah thought prosperity was a sign of righteousness.    ammon and aaron... different missionary tactics. different results.   in priesthood we discussed how we could be better missionaries. the usual replies were "share your testimony with everyone and ask everyone to meet with the missionaries... blah blah blah." is this the best route to take? i think not. instead of focusing so much on mission work, i think we need to focus more on people work. if we are unwilling to help someone with a flat tire just to be nice... who are we to help someone learn about the gospel? i brought up ammon and aaron as prime examples of how to and not to share the gospel.  ammon's tactic (alma 17,18): ammon goes to serve and love them. he truly cares about these people and wants to be their friends. they love him back and want to learn about him and his beliefs  aaron's tactic (alma 21): aaron basically goes straight in and tells them they are sinning and need to repent. they throw aaron in jail  see a difference? lucky for aaron, ammon saves his butt and he get's a second chance where he uses ammon's tactic and learnes to truly love and serve first. success follows.

       the day is over...   i was in a kind of a bummer mood for a while tonight, i'm not sure why. i think i was just tired and recovering from a long day of work. i later went out for some hawaiin ice with megan and sarah and that helped a lot. (sorry i was acting all wierd... thanks for lifting my spirits :) ). afterwards i went to a girls' apartment in my ward where we had been invited to go play some games. ( silent football ... to much to explain, but hella fun) and then kicked backed and talked for a couple hours. i'm feeling fine now, i think, and now feel dumb for being a bum earlier.    friends... not the sitcom   i've seriously got some of the best friends and the best friend right now. aint it great.   i think i'm gonna do some handwritten journaling now, read some scriptures, and get to bed...

       bummer   derek had a four day leave from the army reserves, but his car broke down in the middle of b.f.e. nad he's stuck now. luckily, one of his friends in fort carson is going to drive and get him and then help him tow his car tomorrow. it's too bad, cuz i was really looking forward to seeign him. he's been active since the middle of february last year... all in fort carson. it's kinda good he didn't go over-seas, but it kinda sux too, cuz then it would be a change of environment and something he could actually right home about. he's a great guy and a great friend. because of him, i get offended when i hear someone speak ill of those who didn't serve missions or act like they are any less than a returned missionary. he's the only active person in his immediate family and wasn't raised with the influence to serve one. he's still a great guy and is a hell of a lot better than a lot of returned missionaries i know. hopefully he'l be able to make it next week for tory's reception.

       gotta whole lotta time...   now that i'm not taking any classes until mid-june, i'm gonna have some free time to spend. this will give me a chance to knock some books off my shelf so i don't feel so bad about buying new ones. i'll also have some time to do some mentoring that i've always wanted to do. i'll have to look up the united way again and see where i can help.    birthday at the cabin   my birthday is in a few weeks and i decided i'm gonna get a bunch of us to hit my parents cabin that night. it'll prolly be pretty packed this time which will be hella fun.    goals   i've been doing pretty good so far these last four days. missed two days in a row at the gym though. i was about to go tonight, but ended up going to happy-hour for a few minutes and then hanging out with some girls in my ward. i'll go in the morning tomorrow.   still nothing   maybe i'm getting dumber. maybe i'm more reserved. maybe i'm boring now. maybe nobody is pissing me off (or is not worth mentioning). or maybe i just have nothing going on. i'll think of something good to rage about. it's just building up for a huge-ass post that'll blow you all away.

       life of pi   "things didn't turn out the way they were supposed to, but what can you do? you must take life the way it comes at you and make the best of it."    -- the life of pi  (sounds kinda like my  shit happens  look at life)  hinduism, islam, christianity, atheism, zoos, animal abuse, animal care, the goodness and evil of men, and a transgendered beauty queen (oh wait, the last is from  invisible monsters ) what does this book not have to like? i was a bit skeptical at first when i bought this book, but i am really enjoying it. i'm about a third way through the book and it seems it'll just be getting better    prayer   when life is tough my prayers seem to be so much more, when life is good (as it is now) they tend to be meaningless blabbing. two new goals...  1. pray every morning 2. pray more sincerely. as if god were my buddy (which he is), sitting next to me, listening and talking back

      went to the manti pageant friday night with my ward. i don't care a whole lot for the pageant (besides the volcano ;) ), but it's always fun to go with some friends. our ward rented a bus, but they left before i could get back from work (lacy missed it as well, so we ended up catching a ride with her roommate's brother and riding the bus back). as the pageant began, i had a few things on my mind that i wanted to write down, but having nothing to write with, i decided to text myself with my cell phone. here's what i wrote...  "Im different now. I FEEL my testimony again.  It drives me. I want to be that much better now. I like it!"  "I don't know what i believe all the time. I don't know if all or if even some of it [the book of mormon] historically happened. I am leaning to some of it though. i do know that it comes from god. I love reading it. Each verse rings true and tells me how i should live. I feel so close to my savior when i read it. Hes done so much for me that i cannot do for myself. I want him to be proud of me."  thins with lacy have been up and down lately. one day she's all cuddly with me, the next day it's as if she wants to avoid me at all costs. reminds me of someone else... a route i don't wanna take again. i don't want anything serious. she's only here for another 6 weeks or so (bummer). i just want something consistent. she's a lot of fun and an awesome example.

      when i first moved here to raintree, i thought i had sunk deeper into happy valley. everyone here was either a peter priesthood or a molly mormon. it kinda bugged me and i really didn't want to be a part of it. partly from my realization that i had to stop trying to be different and partly from sime gentle nudging by lacy, i've found that i can be happy and stufs living a more  'happy valley life' . i've really tried to stop swearing and have succeeded quite well and i find myself not wanting to see things that aren't quite uplifting. i took down my britney spears poster and i'm prolly going to sell several of my dvds tomorrow. much of this is prolly a fad that will pass in a while, but i hope it's not. i just don't think i'm at the spiritual level that i should be at.

      i haven't written for a few days. things with lacy have been going great. last night, we went out for a late drive. as we were driving she wrapped her arm around mine and later took my hand to hold it. when we got back, we sat outside my door for an hour or so and talked and cuddled. tonight at fhe, she almost completely ignored me and practically acted as if i didn't exist. i really didn't see her much afterwards. i just don't get it. i'm sure things will be back to all fine and dandy tomorrow.

      so i'm driving north on freedom today, just past taco bell and some idiot truck driver decides to make a right hand turn from the center lane and clips the front left side of my car with his semi, sending me over the curb. in that instant, my whole life passed before my eyes (and it was rather boring). luckily, nobody was hurt (besides small bits of glass in my hands, eyes, and feet). my car wasn't so lucky. it's most likely totaled. believe it or not, it was not my fault and was rather unavoidable. the trucker was cited with making a dagerous turn (and then the idiot went and lied to his insurance agency. he told them that he was on the right lane and that i tried to pass them on the right and that i got cited. the police report will show everyone how full of crap he is.) i'll post some pics of my car and the accident as soon as my brother sends me them.

      once again, not a whole lot to write about. met a really cute girl tonight that just moved into the ward. still not getting the sleep i should be, but that's my own fault. i feel like some sushi right now. (meaning i want to eat some, not that i feel like i am sushi)

      i feel so different and so much better now. i don't know why i held onto this dream and hope so long. i'm glad i've let it go... and surprised at how easy it was once i decided to. unfortunately, i think i had to let go of a lot more as well. although, i'm not sure if that even wanted to stay.  the cabin trip, along with late night tacobell trips w/ mary and rachel, harry potter, american pie 3, halo, and other late nights has left me a bit dazed.  i think i've already used this song on my blog before, but i found it quite fitting...  "are you gonna live your life wonderin’ standing in the back lookin’ around? are you gonna waste your time thinkin' how you’ve grown up or how you missed out?  things are never gonna be the way you want. where's it gonna get you acting serious? things are never gonna be quite what you want. or even at 25, you gotta start sometime.  i’m on my feet, i’m on the floor, i’m good to go. now all i need is just to hear a song i know. i wanna always feel like part of this was mine. i wanna fall in love tonight. are you gonna live your life standing in the back looking around?  are you gonna waste your time? gotta make a move or you'll miss out. someone's gonna ask you what it’s all about. stick around nostalgia won't let you down. someone's gonna ask you what it’s all about. whatcha gonna have to say for yourself? i’m on my feet, i’m on the floor, i’m good to go. now all i need is just to hear a song i know. i wanna always feel like part of this was mine. i wanna fall in love tonight.  crimson and clover, over and over. crimson and clover, over and over. our house in the middle of the street, why did we ever meet? started my rock 'n roll fantasy. don't don't, don't let's start, why did we ever part? kick start my rock 'n rollen heart. i’m on my feet, i’m on the floor, i’m good to go. so come on davey, sing me somethin’ that i know. i wanna always feel like part of this was mine. i wanna fall in love tonight. here tonight. i wanna always feel like part of this was mine i wanna fall in love tonight."  -- urlLink jimmy eat world ,  praise chorus

      feeling sorry for myself got rather boring... so i slapped myself in the face and said, "dammit loyd, smile!"   ...and i smiled   emily had a pretty good excuse to cancel the date, so i decided to give it a chance and call this cute girl i met a couple weeks ago. i got her number back then, but i was warned that she was seriously dating someone. i figured if she says no, then she says no. if she says yes, then yippee. i got to take her to see harry potter tonight. she's pretty cool, but prolly not what you'd expect me to be interested in... on the conservative side (compared to me). she instantly recognized  urlLink death cab for cutie  playing in my car (she went to their concert too) and is a fan of  urlLink 24 . i think i'd like to take her out again.

      my blog's been a lot more personal these last few days. and i've been getting a lot more hits. i guess everyone likes a little drama... as long as it isn't theirs.  it's definitely been a long several days for me, besides my birthday party up in the cabin (which i feared would turn disasterous), this has had to be one of the shittiest birthdays ever. it's my own fault though. in a really rough year, i found a lot of happiness last fall. i was really happy. i guess i just wanted to hold onto my false dream that it was real. so now it's as if it's all come tumbling down. we haven't even dated for a long time.. and now i feel as if i just got dumped... damn i can be pathetic.  the weird thing is remembering aspects of the past i know happened, but being told they never did. i'll prolly never know now. it was a different time and a different situation.  a lot has been cleared up though. i really began to wonder if our friendship was a farce. it's difficult feeling like you really care for someone and see them as your best-friend... want to do anything for them, but feeling like you are seen as just another person... it wasn't that way though. she was just scared of puffing up my hopes that she was still in love with me.  i want to be happy for her when she likes someone else. it's hard though for a couple reasons. one, i can be jealous of that person that she'll have feelings for. two, i'll be jealous of her. i really want to fall for someone. i want that feeling of having a crush. i want to really like someone again. i always get a little jealous when i see someone really liking someone else. i think it'll be harder to see my best friend having what i don't. (kinda like when i was little and all my friends had a nintendo, but my parents wouldn't let me have one)  on the brightside, i've got a date with emily tonight. it'll be the first 2nd date i've had since last fall. i dunno though. i feel like i've already hit my usual 1 or 2 week interest limit. we'll see....

       urlLink     ok,  a tale of two cities  just bored me too much. the story was getting better, but it just dragged on. does dickens need to waste so much of my time to get so little through? maybe i'll finish it another day. i don't always have a long time to read. when i have the time, i wanna feel like i made some headway into whatever i'm reading.  next up is  urlLink choke  by my favorite author, chuck palahniuk

      don't go see  urlLink the village ... unless, of course, you like wasting your money.  the idea is great, the concept incredible. i loved shyamalan’s movies (sixth sense, unbreakable, signs) because of the dual layers to them. the underlying story for  the village  is great, but the main overlaying story is just too predictable and far-fetched. i kept waiting for something to redeem the movie but nothing did. within the first minutes, i had it all figured out and spent the rest of the movie hoping i was at least partly wrong. their puritan way of taking seemed forced... and pray tell how a blind girl can run all over the terrain without tripping over anything. 'tis best to spend your money elsewhere.  ...like  urlLink napoleon dynamite ...yay!

      having to wear white. hair and/or dress can't float up. exact word for word reptition.  that's all that i can think of off the top of my head right now. are these things absolutely necessary for baptisms, or are they things we do by tradition and symbolism? if it is necessary, does that mean that if the witnesses miss one of the above, that the baptized person's rite was insufficient and invalid?  what about the word-for-word repetition? i know christ said to say those words in third nephi and that oliver cowdery used third nephi for the basis of d&c 20, but did jesus mean it 'word-for-word'? also, jesus wasn't saying  those words  recorded in the book of mormon, that's just joseph smith's translation of what he said. and then what about missionaries in foreign countries. who decided which translation is the proper word-for-word usage for baptism?

      well  urlLink my last paper  ended up getting a c+. as crappy as it is, the highest grade given to my class was a b-, i and another got a c+, the rest were c's, c-'s, and a d+.  if i do better on my next paper, he'll apply that grade to this paper. i still gotta figur what it'll be on. i'm thinking prolly something to do with crusades and jihads or perhaps something to deal with pacifism in some eastern religous thought... or maybe i can go the mormon route again.

       urlLink     next up is   urlLink kant: a very short introduction   which i have to read (along with kant's  prolegamena ) before the next semester to get into phil 4140 history of analytical philosophy . it's a small book, but the print is really really tiny so it'll still be a long read.   urlLink war is a force that gives us meaning   was an awesome book that everyone should read. it really showed the disgusting and damning reality of war. i'm still reading  a tale of two cities , but i may stop and finish it later. it's a great book, but it drags on at times.

      yeah, i supported the idea of invading iraq last year. i never really bought into the whole wmd idea. the reason why we went into iraq was to take out saddam. wmd's were just an exuse to go in. the real reason was to take saddam out. looking back (with much clearer hindsight), we should have never gone in. too late now.  so should we pull out our troops now? we've already created a pretty big mess. if we leave now, iraq is going to be left in a pretty cruddy state, which will prolly just lead to bigger problems (though, without saddam, they at least now have a chance for a better nation.) if we stay, well, things might not get all that better. they live in a different world out there. they are not like us. i know this sounds prejudice, but they are uncivilized out there (by our standards). everyone is crying about the treatment and torture of iraqi prisoners, but  urlLink the actions of these few soldiers  is  very  different from  urlLink actions of large civilian mobs in iraq .  no matter what, iraq is going to be a rotten place to live. the only way iraq can be helped is if the entire middle east changes... and that's just not going to happen. i think it's time to pull out.   urlLink here are some other reasons to pull out.    urlLink and these too

      just finished watching  urlLink fahrenheit 9/11 . it's pretty interesting, but seems too more like anti-bush propaganda than a real documentary. while still undecided, i've been leaning more and more against the war in iraq and this pushed me more in that direction, though i don't really buy moore's view on why bush's reasons for attacking iraq.  urlLink i found a site critiquing the film , but have only checked it out a little. like anything of this sort, the only way to get the full picture is to see both sides.   urlLink     speaking of war.. i finished  reflections on mormonism ...well that book had nothing to do with war, but the new book that i'll be reading now is. i've gotta read it for my integrated studies course.  urlLink war is a force that gives us meaning  is supposed to be about man's need and desire for war to give him identity... or something like that

       urlLink First Presidency Issues Statement on Marriage  7 July 2004  The First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued the following statement today. This is a statement of principle in anticipation of the expected debate over same-gender marriage. It is not an endorsement of any specific amendment.  "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints favors a constitutional amendment preserving marriage as the lawful union of a man and a woman."   ......................................  okay.. now i know this is in reference to gay-marriages, but (as has been pointed out in other blogs) this is also statement that supports an amendment that would ban polygamous marriages ( a  man and  a  woman). how can the church do that??? in the late 19th century we (mormons)were crying and protesting that we had the right to have plural-wives, and now we are trying to take that right away from others?

      i finally sat through and watched   urlLink the book of mormon movie  . simply put, this movie sucks. the acting is lousy and terrible at times. the script is pathetic. the settings, effects, and costumes just look fake. the directing seems like the directing from a ward youth play. it's unfortunate that the movie was made.  i guess you have to give them credit for giving it a try, but not too much credit.  luckily(?), another movie based on the book of mormon is in pre-production.   urlLink a voice from the dust: journey to the promise land   will actually have a decent budget and professionals to make it.  in other mormon movie news,   urlLink saints and soldiers   was able to get it's appeal for a pg-13 rating and will finally get releases in august.  urlLink i've seen a screening  of this one and loved it.
