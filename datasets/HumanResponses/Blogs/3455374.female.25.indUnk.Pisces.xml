      Since KG has gotten older we now can play more outside.  Her grandmother got her a cute little gardening set for Easter and KG loves to play with it.  Of course when she first got it she wound up with a mouthful of dirt, yuck! But over a month has gone by and she hasn't done it again, until the other day.  Why she didn't learn from the first time I do not know.    We went out to dinner last night and everyone smiles at her and wants to say hi.  I'm so glad that she is so friendly.  Even this morning I was getting our car serviced and as we were waiting, a mother and her little girl came in and KG was trying to give her hugs and kisses.  She's such a lovey.

      Well, this is a first for me...to put my thoughts out where others will read about them.  I wonder if I can handle it? We'll see how it goes.  Stay tuned...

      For the last few weeks I have been trying to find a suitable bathing suit.  I searched high and low.  The thing is, I knew exactly what I was looking for...I could picture it in my head.  But could I find it? No, of course not.  I settled.  But, it turned out to be a good thing.  Not only did I spend about half the money that I originally was willing to spend but I must say, it looks really nice on me and most of all, it's comfortable.  I'm actually very excited about it.  Mind you, I have not been in a bathing suit in almost 3 years.  See, two years ago I was hugely pregnant with KG and did not want anyone to see me in that condition.  Then, last year I really didn't have any opportunity to go to the beach or to go in someone's pool so I didn't wear one last year either.  So, I'm looking forward to (cautiously) getting some sun and to get that drowsy relaxed feeling of just laying outside and baking for a while.  Of course I'll be slathered up in sunscreen but it will be nice anyway.  Much better than being miserable with a sunburn for the rest of the week!

      Well, that's where I'm headed pretty soon.  I'm really looking forward to my visit with my Arizona family.  I will get to meet my brand new little niece and I will be able to relax and bask in the beautiful (but hot) sunshine.  I've heard that lately it's been up to 110 degrees.  But, we will live in the pool, or air conditioning so I'm not really worried about it.  Although, I am kind of worried about my husband.  He's not coming with me and KG and I don't know how he will be without seeing his little girl for a whole week.  We'll have to call him a few times a day so that he can hear his KG's voice.  It really is such a sweet voice, really high-pitched but oh so sweet.  Especially when she wakes up from a nap and she's in her crib and she says "UH-OH" several times over and over.  The sweetest sound on earth.

      Well, the other day it happened, I found out that I am expecting another baby.  I am excited and at the same time kind of scared.  Not scared like with KG, scared in a different way.  I have fears about money, about handling two kids, about not loving another child like I love KG.  When I found out I was pregnant with KG it was a fear of the unknown...what it's like to be pregnant and have all of these strange changes in your body.  Not to mention childbirth, that is something that no matter how much someone describes it to you, you will never know until you've been there.  And I'm excited but it's a different kind of excitement, kind of like a roller coaster ride that you've been on before, it's still exciting but it's kind of like a "been there done that" kind of thing.    Now I said all of that to say this...I am PREGNANT! I cannot wait for this child to develop inside of me and to feel all of the changes as it's body grows.  The first kick, the first hiccup.  I can't believe that I'm here again, being able to enjoy this tiny miracle that is growing inside.

      Today is such a beautiful day.  Not one drop of humidity and about 75 degrees.  Just gorgeous.  Tomorrow, unfortunately, is supposed to be rainy.  Oh well, at least I have today.    Yesterday I used sunless tanning gel.  I bought a pretty good brand, seeing as how the last time I used a cheaper brand my legs turned orange.  I don't know what I was thinking, to say the least.  The directions say to be careful around your ankles and knees because the skin is thinner and the gel will take differently than the rest of your skin.  I look like an  idiot .  I have a line right above my ankle bone where the tan stops and my very white feet start.  Hopefully it starts to fade by tomorrow because I have a bridal shower to go to and I wanted to wear sandals.  I think I've learned my lesson now, no more sunless tanning products

      KG went to her first parade yesterday.  She really seemed to enjoy herself.  She was clapping and waving to all of the people in the parade.  It was a wonderful weekend.    We had beautiful weather on Saturday and Sunday.  Rich and I were able to finish up our flower beds and Rich was able to mow the lawn and do yard work.  We are starting to wonder how much work we are going to put into this house before we decide to sell it.  Such a hard decision.  Since we've put in so much hard work we are really starting to enjoy our house.  But we know that it is small and as our family grows (eventually) we will need something bigger.  It's kind of bittersweet.  I really don't want to think about another move yet.  I hate moving, I think in our five years of marriage 3 moves is good enough.  For now.  I may think otherwise when KG wants her own time in our 1 bathroom and when Rich and I can't get any privacy.  We'll have to wait and see.

      Yesterday my mom and I took KG to the beach.  Unfortunately, my little girl is afraid of the water.  And sand.  She hated the pool when we went to Arizona but I keep on thinking that maybe the next time it will be different.  I can't say that I had high hopes for the beach, but I honestly didn't think that she would be afraid to leave our blanket and put her little feet in the sand.  She didn't break down crying and start shaking like she did at the pool in AZ but she most definitely did not like it.  My mom and I tried several times to bring her down to the water but she wasn't having it.   I guess I'll just keep on trying.  The other little kids there were running in and out of the water and getting sand all over them while they were building sand castles (which I must say looked like a lot of fun).  Hopefully KG will overcome her fear and learn to enjoy the water one of these days.

      Right now is such a hard time of my pregnancy.&nbsp; The problem being this...I don't really have a pregnant belly yet but at the same time I'm starting to expand and I don't have clothes that are comfortable  and  look decent to wear in public.&nbsp; I have resorted to wearing sweats and elastic waist pants whenever I'm home, but what do I wear to work? I have a few things that used to be too big for me that are okay to wear to work but not wonderful.&nbsp; I just want to get a pregnant belly so that I can wear maternity clothes and people won't look at me wondering  why  I'm wearing maternity clothes.&nbsp;

      This morning I had a Dr's appt.&nbsp; I waited and waited and then I waited some more for the Dr.&nbsp; Finally, when she came in she used the doppler to find the heartbeat.&nbsp; She warned me that since I'm only 10+ weeks that we might not be able to hear it yet.&nbsp; I braced myself, hoping that we would be able to.&nbsp; After a minute of searching she found it, a beautiful, strong heartbeat.&nbsp; It was the sweetest sound a mother could ever hear.&nbsp;

      We have a dilemna this year.&nbsp; Do we save money and forego a vacation or do we wing it and go anyway?  &nbsp; I love Cape Cod.&nbsp; I haven't been in two years and I would really love to go this year.&nbsp; We would go in September because that's when things quiet down with kids going back to school.&nbsp; I would love to go for a whole week but it looks like we'll just go for a couple of days.&nbsp; I guess that's enough.&nbsp; We're not into going to the beach everyday so even if we go just once that would be enough for me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I want to go to Rock Harbor, Marconi Beach, Nauset Beach and all of the other places from my youth.&nbsp; It really is a wonderful place, with interesting history and charm.&nbsp; I know, I sound like an advertisement but I really do love it there.&nbsp;

      KG has found her favorite word...NO! I knew to expect this but I was hoping it wouldn't come this soon.  She has learned that she can try our patience very easily but uttering that tiny little word.  Usually it's in response to something we tell her not to do or to put something down that she shouldn't have, etc.  She will turn 2 years old on August 7th.  I hate the term but I hope she doesn't go through the "terrible twos" stage.  Somehow I was naively hoping that she would skip it, being the angel child that she has been up until now.  Ugh.  As for her 2nd birthday, I have no idea what to do and it's less than a month away.  I guess I should put my thinking cap on and figure something out.  Last year we had two parties for her but that was because my sister got married so family was in town that wouldn't normally.  So, we had a big party with that family because we knew that it would probably be the only birthday they would be here for.  What to do? Yuck, I hate this kind of thing, how about some cake and ice cream? :)Sounds good to me.

      Well, we are back home now after our trip to Arizona.  We had a wonderful time and I really enjoyed basking in the sun and enjoying the pool.  KG on the other hand, did not.  She despised the pool, even a baby pool that I bought for her.  Don't know what it is exactly, even if you dip her toes in the pool she freaks out.  She starts crying and clinging to you for dear life.  We'll have to work through it slowly to get her to enjoy it.  I felt bad because I was really hoping that she would enjoy it and be able to splash around (while I was catching some rays myself, of course).   We did enjoy spending time with both my Dad and Mum.  And of course, my brothers and sister too.  We were able to meet my new niece, which was most definitely a joy.  She's such a cutie, just 6 weeks old.  It was nice to be pampered and not have to worry about what to make for dinner and all of that kind of stuff.  Rich held up well at home by himself.  Luckily he had a busy week at work so it wasn't like he had a ton of time on his hands.    Today I have to go for some bloodwork (prenatal stuff) which will be delightful.  I remember this from when I was pregnant with KG, it's a ton of vials that they have to draw.  Wonderful!
