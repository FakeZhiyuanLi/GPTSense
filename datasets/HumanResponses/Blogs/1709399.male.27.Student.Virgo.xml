        Bell the CAT                                                               Its start of the next CAT season. Over a Lakh students from all over the Country would be competing for those few privileged seats at the presitigious IIM's (Indian Institute of Management) . After some hard thinking , I have decided to jump in the fray. Having already been unsuccesful twice earlier ,  this perhaps might be my last & final attempt. So its either now or Never. I always beleive I have it in me to crack CAT but never gave 100% in my earlier attempts & hope to break the jinx this time. B-School has always been my Dream & though I got a good GMAT score , I have to "Bell the CAT " this time else I might have to go abroad to get that elusive MBA. God Bless me.

        IF by RUDYARD KIPLING                                                One of the most Inspirational poems I have ever read. When the first time I read this , I immediately took a printout and pasted it on my Cupboard so that it serves as an inspiration for me everyday. From Jungle Book to If , Kipling's mastery is amazing.   [IF]    If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you But make allowance for their doubting too, If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, Or being lied about, don't deal in lies, Or being hated, don't give way to hating, And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise: If you can dream--and not make dreams your master, If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim; If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same; If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:  If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word about your loss; If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew To serve your turn long after they are gone, And so hold on when there is nothing in you Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch, If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you; If all men count with you, but none too much, If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!   --Rudyard Kipling

        TIME's Cover Story "Where  the Good Jobs are  Going ? "                                                         This Week's issue of TIME has a Cover Story on the Outsourcing Wave to India . Written with a right Balance between Sensitivity and objectivity , It focusses on India a lot. This might raise a lot of Awareness in the US &  even be the trigger of a potential backlash . Letz wait & watch.

        TOP 10 GLOBAL BRANDS                                       Was Reading this Article in BusinessWeek Magazine about the Top 10 Global Brands . The Top 10 are :   1. Coca-Cola  2. Microsoft   3.IBM  4.GE  5.Intel  6.Nokia  7.Disney  8.Mcdonald's  9.Marlboro  10. Mercedes                                      Some Interesting observations , 8/10 Brands are American (Except Nokia & Mercedes) . Coca-Cola Still retains its Position as the most visible Brand on the Planet . Was Surprised that Sony did not figure in the List .                                       Also did a simple "is it really Global?"  Test and found out to my utter surprise that In Fact I use in everyday life  6/10 Brands (Microsoft,GE,Intel,IBM,Nokia,Coca-Cola) listed and sparingly other two (McDonald's & Disney) .

        JACK - STRAIGHT FROM THE GUT                                                Read Jack Welch's Autobiography "Straight from the Gut" this weekend. The Book has the right mix of Jack's usual aggression with a dose of candor & modesty . India finds a special place in the Book . Jack apparently is an unabashed admirer of India and its Intellectual potential . He writes with unbridled enthusiasm his love for the country and admiration of its people ( of course with subtle snide remarks about the Bureaucracy ) . No wonder that GE turned out to be one of the Biggest "Chalo India "Drivers in the early 90's and one of the key Investor in the Country .

        THE WEEKEND                                                        BCL , Saravana Bhavan , Darna Mana Hai & Sai Baba Temple turned out to be the keywords for this weekend. The saturday turned out to be an usual one with a Trip to Saravana Bhavan in Connought Place ( God Bless these guys for the wonderful food & giving me a break from the Roti-Daal - Chaawal routine of the weekdays) , followed by the British Council Library . BCL in Delhi has a fairly good collection of Books , Although I sorely miss the US & Indian Collection of books which I have got accustomed to. Grabbed a P.G.Wodehouse & a BBC Wildlife Mag and we headed to see "Darna Mana Hai". The Movie Turned out to be a Pleasant surprise with a Different Storyline ( Six Stories & 7 College Guys/gals and lot of murder and Ghosts - The Best of the Six Stories was that of Nana & Vivek) . Sameera Reddy looked awesome and had an amazing screen presence.                                                             Sunday was quite Hot and we went to the Sai Baba mandir in the evening amidst Drizzle .

        BEST OF DILBERT                               Dilbert has universally been acknowledged as the Ultimate in Office Humor. Recently got this Fwded email which was quite Hilarious :    A magazine recently ran a "Dilbert Quotes" contest. They were looking for people to submit quotes from their real life Dilbert-type managers.    Here are the Top Ten finalists:   10. One day my Boss asked me to submit a status report to him concerning a project I was working on. I asked him if tomorrow would be soon enough. He said, "If I wanted it tomorrow, I would have waited until tomorrow to ask for it!"  (Hallmark Cards executive)   9. We know that communication is a problem, but the company is not going to discuss it with the employees."  (Switching supervisor, AT&T Long Lines Division)   8. My sister passed away and her funeral was scheduled for Monday. When I told my Boss, he said she died on purpose so that I would have to miss work on the busiest day of the year. He then asked if we could change her burial to Friday. He said, "That would be better for me."  (Shipping executive, FTD Florists)   7. Quote from the Boss: "Teamwork is a lot of people doing what I say."  (Marketing executive, Citrix Corporation)   6. No one will believe you solved this problem in one day! We've been working on it for months. Now, go act busy for a few weeks and I'll let you know when it's time to tell them."  (R&D supervisor, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing/3M Corp.)   5. "Doing it right is no excuse for not meeting the schedule."  (Plant manager, Delco Corporation)   4. "This project is so important, we can't let things that are more important interfere with it."  (Advertising/Marketing manager, United Parcel Service)   3. "E-mail is not to be used to pass on information or data. It should be used only for company business."  (Accounting manager, Electric BoatCompany)   2. "What I need is an exact list of specific unknown problems we might encounter!!"  (Lykes Lines Shipping)   1. "As of tomorrow, employees will only be able to access the building using individual security cards. Pictures will be taken next Wednesday and employees will receive their cards in two weeks."  (This was the winning quote from Fred Dales at Microsoft Corp. in Redmond, WA.)

        TRAVEL DIARY - NAINITAL                                        I am a Travelaholic by any Standards. Meeting new people , knowing about New Cultures , Seeing the Wonder of Mother Nature have always fascinated me and keeps me moving during most weekends . Most of my friends describe me as a Crazy Travelhog since I dont spare any weekends and also manage to pull most of my friends alongwith me from their happy Weekend Slumber.                                                      It was with incredible Disbelief that I heard that July 4 was going to be Holiday for me (Its funny & Ironical that in India I was getting a Holiday for the American Independence day , but then I was Servicing an American Client and entitled to such perks !!) . July 4 fell on a Friday , which meant that it was going to be a long weekend of 3 days holidays. Having Recently moved to Delhi and having already seen Agra , Mathura , Vrindavan , Dehradun & Mussorie (will post those travelogs later) , I had only two Destinations in Mind viz Nainital or Amritsar . I also managed to convince a few colleagues to join me (They Sheepishly did so -- poor guys ) and we booked an Ambassdor Car and decided to leave Friday early morning . We were a Sleepy Bunch of five Guys,  who merrily crawled into the car and the Drive turned out to be a rather pleasant one. The Roads were excellent & thanks to the new Toll roads the Journey was swift and enjoyable. Naintal is 325 Kms from Delhi and duringmost of the Journey I was singing old Hindi Songs with another friend for company. (Although my Hindi at best could be termed Quite average)  .                                                                     We Reached Nainital at around 11am ( a 6.5 Hours Journey ) and were welcomed by the Naina Tal Lake ( What a Breathtaking view , I fell instantly in love with the lake ) . The Legend goes that the eyes of Parvathi had fallen in this place and hence the name (Naina = eye , tal = lake ) . We Decided to take a Dormitory just adjacent to the Lake , so that we could have the splendid green lake view. We got freshened up and were ravenously Hungry and had Lunch ( a pretty bad one , I should say ) and started out for the Zoo . I am always fond of Zoos ( In fact anyone who travels with me always complains that the first place I go to in any city is the Zoo !!!) . The Zoo was a very steep Climb but housed some really rare Mountain species like the Snow leopard , Siberian tiger , Mountain Goats. From there we headed to the lake for boating but a dense fog made most of our boating a very difficult exercise , since we could hardly see more than 5 feet ahead. We then retreated back to the Hotel for a well deserved Rest .                                                                         The Next day started with a Brunch ( which turned out to be a equally bad one , But I learnt a very valuable lesson in Culinary choice viz Never Order South Indian Food in the North (esp in Hills) & Vice - Versa ) . We Went to the Gun Hill from where we got some incredible views of the Hills & also went to visit the Hanuman grahi temple. We later went on a incredible Horseback trip to the Dorothy's seat ( An Incredibly beautiful view from the top of the Entire Naintal & the Hills) . I decided it was time I get myself a Good SLR Camera to capture such beauty and give some rest to my 20 year old Yashica Point & shoot camera ( I am still googling a lot about the the Best SLR camera to buy in my budget !!) . Had a few anxious moments while returning when my Horse was chased by the street dogs & fled from the owner's control ( I somehow Managed to control it and felt like Alexander the Great controlling Buciphalus !!!) .                                                            We decided to start early next day since it was risky to drive in the night and after a tedious journey reached Delhi at around 8.30 and had some Great south Indian Food at Andhra Bhavan near CP and retired back to our cosy homes.                                               Looking back at the Trip , Naintal is easily one of the most Beautiful Hill Stations I have ever visited , the Green Lake & the surrounding verdant locales , still remain etched in my memory. I also made thick friends with the colleagues who came with me and thus ended a very satisfying long weekend.

         ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE               Here is a Surprising find to Support my earlier post. Was Skimming through the pages of the Latest "India Today" Issue , when an article on the Indian Economy caught my eye. From a perpetual Borrower in the past , India has now transformed into a Creditor to the IMF. We have pre-payed a $3 Billion worth of Loan to the World Bank & have also lent monetary assistance to Countries like Brazil & Burundi . So does this mean that India is on the slow growthpath towards Economic progress & Independence ??

         INDIA - CRUISING TOWARDS SUPERPOWERDOM              Patriotism seems to be the Flavor of the season , with "Indian-ness" being a key Brand Globally these days . After almost a decade of liberalising the economy , we are finally seeing the fruits of it with the Forex Reserves touching a new High and India emerging as a key player in the Global IT Outsourcing wave. In spite of the persistant Rampant Corruption , Poverty & the "babudom"still plaguing and inhibiting growth , India undeniably has made rapid strides towards Globalisation and Economic Development . Everyday we hear stories of another Fortune 500 Giant moving / Outsourcing some of its business to India and newer jobs being created here as a Result. We stand at the threshold of a tremendous future , Which I hope we catch up with inspite of the Page 3 Headlines we continue to make. I choose to remain an incorrigible optimist in this regard preferring to see the half filled glass ( IT/Pharma progress , Growing Literacy , Growth of an educated & talented working class, Bulging Forex Reserves ) than the Half empty ( Political Instability / Corruption , Skewed Outdated Policies still in some key areas , Poverty ) . Lets all Hope & resolve to build a stronger & Vibrant nation for the future .

        FOUR KINDS OF PEOPLE                                             I am reading a book called " Who Says Elephants can't Dance " by Lou Gerstner ( Its about IBM's Magical Turnaround in the 90's ) . Found this interesting piece from there . There are four kinds of people :             THOSE WHO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN            THOSE FOR WHOM THINGS HAPPEN            THOSE WHO WATCH THINGS HAPPEN            THOSE WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW THINGS ARE HAPPENING .

        THE END OF AN ERA - PETE SAMPRAS                                                                           Although it was much expected , the retirement of Pete Sampras caused immense sadness to millions of Tennis lovers like me . Arguably , one of the Greatest players to have graced the Court , Pete's acheivements speak volumes for his immense talent & incredible hardwork . 14 Grand Slams in this Competitive era is not a joke. He was the undisputed King of Grass ( Wimbledon) & seeing his Serve & Volley game in the Wimbledon is sheer joy. He has called it quits at the right time  after an incredible win at the US Open 2002  , where in 1990 as a young 19 year old he captured the attention & hearts of the entire globe.                                                                          Unlike most of the tennis players of the current era , he let his Racket do the talking instead of his mouth. He has remained my favourite player for a long time & I would definitely be missing him .                                                                           I would also like to mention that my becoming a fan of Sampras , was greatly influenced by my favourite sportswriter - Nirmal Shekar ( He writes for THE HINDU ). If there is one sentence I could say about Nirmal it is -- He writes poetry in prose . He is one heck of a writer ( If you want to know what Sportswriting is all about then read his articles , its sheer poetry ) . Nirmal is huge fan of Sampras and am waiting for the next Sportstar edition for his article on Sampras's retirement .

        MUMBAI BLASTS                                  Once  again the financial capital of the Nation has been crippled by Terrorism & violence . Its shocking to see such gruesome incidents becoming increasingly common in Mumbai of late . I hope the Government from now on takes top priority in Internal security and values common people's lives. Its sad to see the "City That never sleeps " being surrounded by Gloom & distress .

SCO has been Scorned by the Entire Linux Community for raking up the issue . The Suit undermines the Noble pursuit & basis of the Open Source & free Software Foundation and has angered most of the Geeks . Its interesting how the Case is going to take its course , beacause dependent on it is the future of one of the most important revolutions in Technology .

        MONOPOLY & PRODUCTS                                                            In the realm of Business some companies exercise total monopoly over a segment/product that the Product tends to be identified with them . Normally in most cases they might be the inventors of that Product or segment . I will write more on this topic and cite examples later. Was reading one of my Quiz group questions & was surprised to know that Canon and not Xerox is the leader in Photocopier Market . In India in particular the act of photocopying has always been called "Xeroxing "signifying the extent to which they were entwined.                                                                 . I have in the past read articles about the decline of Xerox (There was good write up on Anne Mulcahy their current CEO who is effecting a turn-around in FORTUNE a few months back) but this came as a bit of surprise to me . Any inputs ( Similar examples I could think of are Caterpillar , Ford , Mcdonnel-Douglas , Apple -- Companies which created / were leaders in their respective segments but languishing now )  ??

        TRAVEL DIARY - CHANDIGARH & AMRITSAR                                            I was eagerly awaiting the Thursday morning for the long pending Chandigarh - Amritsar trip. The Independance day long weekend and my parents presence in Delhi meant that I had to make the trip this time. I finalised the plans for Delhi - Kurukshetra - Chandigarh - Jalandhar - Amritsar - Wagah Border - Ludhiana - Delhi to be covered in a little over four days . I had the choice of either taking the Shatabdi from Delhi or renting a Car and preferred the later for the Time I would be saving and the ability to cover far more places.                 We started off on the Thursday Morning around 7 am from Delhi in a Tata Indica and reached Kurukshetra by around 9.30 am .    KURUKSHETRA  : One of the most Visited places in Haryana , the venue of the Mythical Mahabharata battle and Gitopadesha , Kurukshetra lies 150 Kms to the west of Delhi . Kurukshetra was the Venue for the 18 Day war between Pandavas & Kauravas which the former won .There is a friendly helpful Tourism office at the entrance where you can grab free pamplets of the places to visit there . If you drive ahead for around 6 Kms , you will reach "Jyotisar" the venue of Gitopadesha . A small temple has been constructed there and the Linga & tree there are supposed to be thousands of years old . 2 Kms Back on the Track is Bheeshma Kund , the place where Bheeshma had lain in a bed of arrows awaiting Dakshinayana . There is a Huge Hanuman statue (around 40 Feet) and a small pond ( According to Myth when Bheeshma asked for water to quench his thirst Arjuna shot an arrow on the ground and Ganga , the Mother of Bheeshma quenched his thirst ) . There is a nice Krishna Museum down the Road which has wonderful intricate paintings / Sculptures  ( particularly from Orissa & Tamil Nadu ) .  We then headed towards Chandigarh .    CHANDIGARH  : Chandigarh (Its called City Beautiful) is located 245 Kms from Delhi & we reached there by around 4 pm . We directly headed to the Pinjore Gardens which is located 20 kms to the east of Chandigarh on the Shimla Highway . The Pinjore Gardens were constructed in the 17th Century by Fidai Khan ,foster brother of Aurangazeb and resembles a typical Moghul Garden . Its a seven layered garden with ample trees & fountains . We then headed back to the City and checked into to the Yatri Niwas Hotel ( a rather pricey one , a Double room + extra cot cost us around Rs.800 ) . We then headed to Sector -17 which is the upmarket area of Chandigarh . You get a feeling as if you are in Europe ( Though I have never been there!!), with huge shopping area and a sprawling chowk . For the South Indians Sec-17 offers couple of good restaurants viz . Sagar & Indian Coffee House , where you get some  nice Idlis , Dosas & Veg Thalis .                                        We started the next day with a visit to the Rose Garden . Its a sprwaling park with around 5000 varieties of Roses and is reputed to be one of the largest in Asia ( My thoughts went back to a Similar Rose Garden I had seen in Portland , Oregon a few years earlier ) . Its a nice place for Morning / evening walks and lies quite close to Sec-17. We then headed to the Rock Garden , the epitome of struggle & success of One man - Nek Chand . Nek Chand was a Road Inspector with the Govt in the 50's and had built a small garden with waste materials like broken Porcelian , Bangles , Sacks etc .It was about to be demolished in the 70's but good sense prevailed and now its renowned throughtout the World and Nek Chand gained International fame. Its an amazing place where you could see the Creative genius of a man with unbridled passion. We then Headed to the Sukhna lake where amidst the drizzle we went for paddle boating . Its a fairly huge lake and nice place to spend the evenings . Just down the road is the Vidhan Soudha & secretariat and we shot a couple of photos there before heading to Jalandhar .   Afterthoughts : Chandigarh is easily one of the most beautiful cities in India . A very well planned city ( by French Architect Le Corbusier) , its full of parks & greenery .    JALANDHAR  : It lies 100 Kms to the west of Chandigarh . Its very famous for its Sporting goods ( Most of the Cricket Bats & other sporting gear are manufactured here ). "Basti Bawa Khel"is the sports market which lies 5 kms away from the city Centre. Since We were there on the I-Day most of the shops were closed and we just ended up spending the night in the city. Next morning we started for Amritsar .    AMRITSAR  : Amritsar lies around 120 kms to the west of Jalandhar & is one of the Holiest places for Sikhs . The world Famous Golden Temple is situated here  & so also the Jalian Waala Bagh memorial . We checked into a hotel right beside the Golden Temple . Words fail me in describing the beautry of the Golden temple . It lies majestically perched in the centre of the pond with the 1000 kg Gold roof shimmering in the Sun.You have to cover your head before entering the temple ( they provide free scarfs at the entrance or your handkarchief would do ) and wash your feet . The Golden Temple was constructed by the fourth Guru of Sikhs , Guru Ram Das who also founded the city of Amritsar . The inner sanctum is called the Har Mandir and there is a long queue to get into it . The Langar ( Sikh Kitchen) provides delicious free food inside the temple to thousands of devotees everyday .There is continuous recitation of Guru Granth Sahib and the holy text is housed here .Thousand of Sikhs take a holy dip in the pond everyday which is supposed to cure all  ailments.               There is also a Museum at the upper floor of the Clock tower which traces the Sikh history & the sacrfices / valour during the Mughal period. The paintings depict the gruesome horror inflicted on the sikhs by Mughals ( Mughals wanted the Sikhs to convert to Islam ) and the Martyrdom of Sikhs .                      A five minute walk from the temple brings you to the Jaalian Waala Bagh Memorial . A peaceful crowd of indians had gathered in this Ground on April 13th , 1919. General Dyer ordered  indiscrimnate shooting of the innocent crowd which left around 357 dead and 1500 injured .General Dyer died 8 years later from a fall & Micheal O'dwyer (The Lt. Governer) was assasinated by Udham Singh in London in 1940 . The Memorial contans a small photo gallery of the martyrs & a tall structure erected to commemorate their martyrdom . The walls still contain the bullet marks and this place definitely evokes a strong patriotism .     WAGAH BORDER  : Wagah border is the only arterial Roadway Post which Connects India & Pakistan. It lies 30 kms to the West of Amritsar . Everyday the Indian & Pakistan troops involve in a Harmless Charade of patriotic act . The Flags are hoisted and downed at the Dawn & Dusk  on either side. There is a huge gallery constructed on either side of the Border where the Indian & paki crowds throng to watch this spectacle ( which has  become quite famous thanks to the Television ) . Patriotic Songs boom across the Speakers & the Indians enjoy a upper hand since their gallery can accomodate around 5000 people as against the 1000 capacity of the pakis .   LUDHIANA  : We started for Ludhiana on Sunday Morning . Ludhiana lies on the NH-1 ( G.T.Road) on the way back to Delhi around 150 kms from Amritsar . Its the garment Capital of India , where you could get very good Shirts , T-Shirts , Trousers for throwaway prices ( I got T-shirts for Rs.60 , which would cost close to Rs.200-250 in metros). We spent a few hours shopping here and reached Delhi back on Sunday Night .   We had covered a Total Distance of 1200 kms and had thoroughly enjoyed the trip.     TRAVEL TIPS : The Ideal time to make this trip is September / October , post the monsoon season and just before the onset of Winter .If Travelled as a Group per head expenses would come to Rs.2500 . Make sure you carry a Road map of North India and a Travel Guide with you always.

        FALLEN STAR - KOBE                                         It was a very Shocking news when a few weeks back I read about the Sexual Assault case against Kobe Bryant , the Lakers NBA Superstar . Though I am not a big Lakers fan ( I prefer the Spurs / Mavs / Kings -- the Anti-Laker brigade ) , I have always been an admirer of Kobe. Potentially the only one in the Current NBA Circuit ( oh..wait ...Letz wait & see how LeBeron performs) who contends for the Throne of MJ , Its sad to see Kobe going the OJ way . Though I spent a few years in America , I could never fully comprehend the american views on Morality .                                          Kobe's Talent has never been in question , and his clutch plays in particular have saved Lakers from numerous embarassing defeats. He has always been a very shy , soft-spoken perfect Gentleman off the field & my first reaction to this news was "Et tu kobe "??

        TELECOM TALES                                                     It was with incredible surprise that I read the TOI Article which claimed that Delhi now has more Mobile Phone users than Fixed line users . The Transformation in the Telecom Industry has been amazing in the last few years ( This is inspite of Muddle over ever Changing prices & TRAI Vs Operator Wars & CDMA Vs GSM Battles !!) . Telephone has always been Considered as a Luxury & STD/ ISD a bastion of the Rich & famous . But Today on my cell phone a Mobile to Mobile Long Distance  Call costs the same as a Local call , a drastic change from the 90's . In a Country like India with a Huge Population and a Burgeoning Middle Class its always the volumes which will tilt the Revenue equation in favour of the Operators than the premium. This is further corroborated by the fact that Mobile Phone is no longer a luxury but a Necessity & Call Volumes have increased multi-fold in the last few years.                                                      The Future looks exciting with the Govt recognising the potential of VoIP & the Country starving for more Bandwidth & Sophistication. So the cost of saying a sweet hello increasingly looks to be getting more inexpensive .........................

        Western Values And Eastern Challenges  - NR Narayana Murthy                                                               Came Across this Interesting Article on the web. For a Generation which feels Confused between Western Values & Eastern Challenges , this article might prove to be an eye-opener . It also proves there is much more to West than just MTV & Paparazzi .    As it is said in the Vedas: Man can live individually, but can survive only collectively. Hence, our challenge is to form a progressive community by balancing the interests of the individual and that of the society. To meet this we need to develop a value system where people accept modest sacrifices for the common good.   A value system is the protocol for behaviour that enhances the trust, confidence and commitment of members of the community. It goes beyond the domain of legality - It is about decent and desirable behaviour. Further, it includes putting the community interests ahead of your own. Thus, our collective survival and progress is predicated on sound values.   There are two pillars of the cultural value system - loyalty to family and loyalty to community. One should not be in isolation to the other, because, successful societies are those which combine both harmoniously. It is in this context that I will discuss the role of Western values in contemporary Indian society.   As an Indian, I am proud to be part of a culture, which has deep-rooted family values. We have tremendous loyalty to the family. For instance, parents make enormous sacrifices for their children. They support them until they can stand on their own feet. On the other side, children consider it their duty to take care of aged parents. We believe: "Mathru devo bhava, pithru devo bhava" (Mother is God and Father is God). Further, brothers and sisters sacrifice for each other. In fact, the eldest brother or sister is respected by all the other siblings.   As for marriage, it is held to be a sacred union - husband and wife are bonded, most often, for life. In joint families, the entire family works towards the welfare of the family. There is so much love and affection in our family life. This is the essence of Indian values and one of our key strengths.   Our families act as a critical support mechanism for us. In fact, the credit to the success of Infosys goes, as much to the founders as to their families, for supporting them through the tough times. Unfortunately, our attitude towards family life is not reflected in our attitude towards community behaviour. From littering the streets to corruption to breaking of contractual obligations, we are apathetic towards the common good.   The primary difference between the West and us is that, there, people have a much better societal orientation. In the West - the US, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand - individuals understand that they have to be responsible towards their community. They care more for the society than we do. Further, they generally sacrifice more for the society than us. Quality of life is enhanced because of this.This is where we need to learn form the West.   Consider some of the lessons that we Indians can learn from the West:   Respect for the public good - In the West, there is respect for the public good. For instance, parks free of litter, clean streets, public toilets free of graffiti - all these are instances of care for the public good.  On the contrary, in India, we keep our houses clean and water our gardens everyday but, when we go to a park, we do not think twice before littering the place.  Attitude to corruption - This is because of the individual's responsible behaviour towards the community as a whole. On the contrary, in India, corruption, tax evasion, cheating and bribery have eaten into our vitals. For instance, contractors bribe officials, and construct low-quality roads and bridges.  Corruption, as we see in India, is another example of putting the interest of oneself, and at best that of one's family, above that of the society.  Society is relatively corruption free in the West. It is very difficult to bribe a police officer into avoiding a speeding ticket. The result is that society loses in the form of substandard defence equipment and infrastructure, and low-quality recruitment, just to name a few impediments. Unfortunately, this behaviour is condoned by almost everyone.  Public apathy - Apathy in solving community matters has held us back from making progress, which is otherwise within our reach. We see serious problems around us but do not try to solve them. We behave as if the problems do not exist or are somebody else's. On the other hand, in the West, people solve societal problems proactively.  There are several examples of our apathetic attitude.  (i) For instance, all of us are aware of the problem of drought in India. More than 40 years ago, Dr KL Rao - an irrigation expert, suggested creation of a water grid connecting all the rivers in North and South India, to solve this problem. Unfortunately, nothing has been done about this.   (ii) The story of power shortage in Bangalore is another instance. In 1983, it was decided to build a thermal power plant to meet Bangalore's power requirements. Unfortunately, we have still not started it.   (iii) The Milan subway in Bombay is in a deplorable state for the past 40 years, and no action has been taken.   To quote another example, considering the constant travel required in the software industry; five years ago, I had suggested a 240-page passport. This would eliminate frequent visits to the passport office. In fact, we are ready to pay for it. However, I am yet to hear from the ministry of external affairs on this. We, Indians, would do well to remember Thomas Hunter's words: Idleness travels very slowly, and poverty soon overtakes it.   What could be the reason for this? We were ruled by foreigners for over thousand years. Thus, we have always believed that public issues belonged to some foreign ruler and that we have no role in solving them. Moreover, we have lost the will to proactively solve our own problems and have got used to just executing someone else's orders.   Borrowing Aristotle's words: "We are what we repeatedly do." Thus, having done this over the years, the decision-makers in our society are not trained for solving problems. Our decision-makers look to somebody else to take decisions. Unfortunately, there is nobody to look up to, and this is the tragedy.   Our intellectual arrogance has also not helped our society. I have travelled extensively, and in my experience, have not come across another society where people are as contemptuous of better societies as we are, with as little progress as we have achieved. Remember that arrogance breeds hypocrisy.   No other society gloats so much about the past as we do, with as little current accomplishment. Friends, this is not a new phenomenon, but at least a thousand years old. For instance, Al Barouni, the famous Arabic logician and traveller of the 10th century, who spent about 30 years in India from 997 AD to around 1027 AD, referred to this trait of Indians.   According to him, during his visit, most Indian pundits considered it below their dignity even to hold arguments with him. In fact, on a few occasions when a pundit was willing to listen to him, and found his arguments to be very sound, he invariably asked Barouni: which Indian pundit taught these smart things!   The most important attribute of a progressive society is respect for others who have accomplished more than they themselves have, and learn from them. Contrary to this, our leaders make us believe that other societies do not know anything!   At the same time, everyday, in the newspapers, you will find numerous claims from our leaders that ours is the greatest nation. This has to stop. These people would do well to remember Thomas Carlyle's words: The greatest of faults is to be conscious of none."   If we have to progress, we have to change this attitude, listen to people who have performed better than us, learn from them and perform better than them. Infosys is a good example of such an attitude.   We continue to rationalise our failures. No other society has mastered this art as well as we have. Obviously, this is an excuse to justify our incompetence, corruption, and apathy. This attitude has to change. As Sir Josiah Stamp has said: "It is easy to dodge our responsibilities, but we cannot dodge the consequences of dodging our responsibilities."   Another interesting attribute, which we Indians can learn from the West, is their accountability. Irrespective of your position, in the West, you are held accountable for what you do. However, in India, the more 'important' you are, the less answerable you are.   For instance, a senior politician once declared that he 'forget' to file his tax returns for 10 consecutive years - and he got away with it. To quote another instance, there are over 100 loss-making public sector units in India. Nevertheless, I have not seen action taken for bad performance against top managers in these organisations.   In the West, each person is proud about his or her labour that raises honest sweat. On the other hand, in India, we tend to overlook the significance of those who are not in professional jobs. We have a mindset that reveres only supposedly intellectual work. For instance, I have seen many engineers, fresh from college, who only want to do cutting-edge work and not work that is of relevance to business and the country.   However, be it an organisation or society, there are different people performing different roles. For success, all these people are required to discharge their duties. This includes everyone from the CEO to the person who serves tea - every role is important. Hence, we need a mindset that reveres everyone who puts in honest work.   Indians become intimate even without being friendly. They ask favors of strangers without any hesitation. For instance, the other day, while I was travelling from Bangalore to Mantralayam, I met a fellow traveller on the train. Hardly five minutes into the conversation, he requested me to speak to his MD about removing him from the bottom 10 per cent list in his company, earmarked for disciplinary action.   I was reminded of what Rudyard Kipling once said: A westerner can be friendly without being intimate while an easterner tends to be intimate without being friendly.   Yet another lesson to be learnt from the West, is about their professionalism in dealings. The common good being more important than personal equations, people do not let personal relations interfere with their professional dealings. For instance, they don't hesitate to chastise a colleague, even if he is a personal friend, for incompetent work.   In India, I have seen that we tend to view even work interactions from a personal perspective. Further, we are the most 'thin-skinned' society in the world - we see insults where none is meant. This may be because we were not free for most of the last thousand years.   Further, we seem to extend this lack of professionalism to our sense of punctuality. We do not seem to respect the other person's time. The Indian Standard Time somehow seems to be always running late. Moreover, deadlines are typically not met. How many public projects are completed on time?   The disheartening aspect is that we have accepted this as the norm rather than an exception. Meritocracy by definition means that we cannot let personal prejudices affect our evaluation of an individual's performance. As we increasingly start to benchmark ourselves with global standards, we have to embrace meritocracy.   In the West, right from a very young age, parents teach their children to be independent in thinking. Thus, they grow up to be strong, confident individuals. In India, we still suffer from feudal thinking. I have seen people, who are otherwise bright, refusing to show independence and preferring to be told what to do by their boss. We need to overcome this attitude if we have to succeed globally.   The Western value system teaches respect to contractual obligation. In the West, contractual obligations are seldom dishonoured. This is important - enforceablity of legal rights and contracts is the most important factor in the enhancement of credibility of our people and nation.   In India, we consider our marriage vows as sacred. We are willing to sacrifice in order to respect our marriage vows. However, we do not extend this to the public domain. For instance, India had an unfavourable contract with Enron. Instead of punishing the people responsible for negotiating this, we reneged on the contract - this was much before we came to know about the illegal activities at Enron.   To quote another instance, I had given recommendations to several students for the national scholarship for higher studies in US universities. Most of them did not return to India even though contractually they were obliged to spend five years after their degree in India.   In fact, according to a professor at a reputed US university, the maximum default rate for student loans is among Indians - all of these students pass out in flying colours and land lucrative jobs, yet they refuse to pay back their loans. Thus, their action has made it difficult for the students after them, from India, to obtain loans.   Further, we Indians do not display intellectual honesty. For example, our political leaders use mobile phones to tell journalists on the other side that they do not believe in technology! If we want our youngsters to progress, such hypocrisy must be stopped.   We are all aware of our rights as citizens. Nevertheless, we often fail to acknowledge the duty that accompanies every right. To borrow Dwight Eisenhower's words: "People that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both."   Our duty is towards the community as a whole, as much as it is towards our families. We have to remember that fundamental social problems grow out of a lack of commitment to the common good. To quote Henry Beecher: Culture is that which helps us to work for the betterment of all.   Hence, friends, I do believe that we can make our society even better by assimilating these Western values into our own culture - we will be stronger for it. Most of our behaviour comes from greed, lack of self-confidence, lack of confidence in the nation, and lack of respect for the society.   To borrow Gandhi's words: There is enough in this world for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed. Let us work towards a society where we would do unto others what we would have others do unto us. Let us all be responsible citizens who make our country a great place to live.   In the words of Winston Churchill, "Responsibility is the price of greatness." We have to extend our family values beyond the boundaries of our home. Let us work towards maximum welfare of the maximum people - "Samasta janaanaam sukhino bhavantu".   Finally, let us of this generation, conduct ourselves as great citizens rather than just good people so that we can serve as good examples for our younger generation.   Thank you.

        ENCOUNTERS OF A DIFFERENT KIND  (THANKS TO SPIELBERG FOR THE TITLE!!)                                                                         Hey ,"which class do you study?". A very harmless Question in most cases but not certainly when it is asked to me. I did not know what prompted him (The Him in Description was a 30 Year Old , cigaratte smoking Stranger at the basement of a friend's apt )  to ask this question to me  ( Since I always roam around in a T-shirt & shorts , I could take some reassurance !!) ? . I told him that I don't study in a school & that I work. He said since the novel I was holding was a Comics ( Once he again he was mistaken since it was P.G.Wodehouse Novel with a cariacature of jeeves & Wooster on cover which he had presumed as comics) , he had asked that question. I told him it was not a comics & it was a novel and told him the author , whom he didn't know. He then quickly had a look at the Novel and asked me if I was a member at the British Council Library . I answered a smug "yes" . He asked me If I knew when the Orientation session was scheduled for Indian Travellers to UK . I told him , I was just a member at BCL and didn't work there . He then proceeded to tell me that he was heading for UK next week ( I presume he must be a software engineer , because they are the only tribe with such pompous attitude & nil literary knowledge !!) . I gave him the BCL phone numbers & website address and in return didn't even get a Thanks.                                                          Its definitely a strange two minute encounter , but leaves a lot of questions unanswered about manners & changing attitude these days !!...

        P.G.WODEHOUSE                                        What kind of Books do you read ? Who is your favourite Author ? ... As a Voracious Bibliophile , I have been asked this question numerous times and everytime I have fumbled for an answer.   What do I read ? --- Practically anything I can get my hands on , although these days I read less of fiction & more of Biographies , Business , Wildlife & Culture / Travel Books.   Who is my Favourite Author ? -- Definitely I do not have an asnwer for this . Every author has his own Distinct style & at various times I have liked most of them . But I do definitely know that "P.G.Wodehouse" remains perched somewhere at the top of that list.                                      He is the master of Humour & satire and subtle comedy . It always takes me a long time to finish a Wooster & Jeeves Novel because most of the time you have read between or into the lines to get the hidden subtle humour . His prolificity has never ceased to amaze me and "Wooster & Jeeves"stand out as the two most immortal fictional characters to have been created in English literature. I am a Succor for comedy. Most of my Favourite movies (be it in English or Hindi or Tamil) are comedy movies and hence its no wonder that P.G has had such a deep impact on me.

        RIVER RAFTING & CAMPING - RISHIKESH                                             It was time for an adventure trip since most of my weekend Outing till now had been more of an architectural & historical pursuits . I was eagerly looking forward to the post monsoon season because that heralds the advent of Adventure Sports & Wildlife pursuits .                                          I have been enamoured by the White Water River Rafting ever since seeing it on Discovery a few Years ago. We ( a Group of Seven - Hum saath saath hain !!) started on a nice sunny Saturday morning from Delhi in a Scorpio to Rishikesh . Rishikesh lies 250 Kms to the North of Delhi & is the Yoga Capital of the world (The Beatles came here in the 60's to meet Maharishi Yogesh Yogi ) . Rishikesh is also famous for its Water sports thanks to the rapid flow of Ganges descending from the Mountains.                                         It was almost afternoon  when we reached there . There was another surprise awaiting us there when the Tour Operator gave us a package deal for River Rafting and Over night camping in Tents on the banks of Ganges. We gleefully took the Deal and headed to Brahmapuri (13 Kms to the North of Rishikesh ) to start our Rafting trip. The Ganges looked fearsome there flowing at an awesome speed & accentuated with foaming rapids. We were given the Necessary Safety Gear ( Helmets , Life Jacket & Oars) and the Instructions. The Inflated raft was just the kind I had seen on the TV and my inner excitement grew as we stepped into the water. The Total stretch we had to Raft was 11kms . This Stretch consisted of four Rapids Viz. Initiation , Double Trouble & Hilton. At the rapids the raft swayed to the force of the rapids and water splashing all over it and setting the adrenaline flowing. The Hilton rapid almost blinded us for 10 seconds with splashing water as Our raft  swayed to the Tumultous foam around us leaving everyone exhilirated. We finally reached the Destination in more than an Hour , leaving us with an unforgetable experience.                          We then reached the Camp. Tents had been built on the banks of the River with no electricity and just a Chimney Lamp for company. With a Life Jacket and a Rope we swam in the Ganges water amidst the free flowing River. We made Bonfire and sang songs . I was in a Extremely Nostalgic & Reflective mood and ended up singing for Hours together. We also made some Barbeque ( Veggie stuff for me though) and had a wonderful Conversation reflecting our Past . The beds were made inside the Tents and I had a Great sleep amidst Mother Nature.                         The next morning we had a mini trek to a nearby Waterfalls and it turned out to be a wonderfully pristine Location. We had a bath in the falls and returned  to the Camp and started our Trip to Hardwar . We Visited the Mansa Devi Temple by Cable Car & also the Chandi Devi ( Adi Shankara had initiated the Construction of the Temple) temple. The view from both these temple were fabulous . We then started our Return back to Delhi and inspite of a Traffic Jam ended up reaching Noida by Around 10 pm and capped it with some southie Dinner at Saagar in Noida.                     I enjoyed this trip thoroughly since it was so different from the ones I have done in the past. Afterall what is Life without Adventure !!   TRAVEL TRIPS : The best time to make this Trip is from Mid-September to Mid-November (Post Monsoon) , when you have adequate water flowing in the Ganges. Shivpuri & Kaudilya ( Both Located near Rishikesh are much more adventurous but not for first timers ) are what we have planned for next time. Do not miss the Camping experience because its once in a life time oppurtunity particularly for city dwellers . Make sure you take some Woolen clothing since the nights are cold.

        SAHIR                                                              This is perhaps my first post on one of my favourite topics - Music & Ghazals . Was Listening to the Song "Kabhie Kabhie " the other day & once again much more than the wonderful music of the song , what struck me were the Lyrics of the Immortal Sahir . I have always founds his Lyrics to be Straight & Direct , which means that the lyrics hit at you and you could feel the bitterness & anger behind them .  He minces no words in expressing the Decadence of social values or in the Flagrant displays of the Rich & wealthy . He was a very proud man & remained a Bachelor throughout his life.  ( It was rumoured that he insisted on getting one Rupee more than what Lata Charges to sing a song because he had so much faith in himself & his lyrics )  .                                               Here are a few of his songs which rank among my favourites & the lyrics as usual are mesmerising :   1. Jaane Vo Kaise Log the Jinko Pyaar ( From the movie "Pyaasa"  - Its a combination of Geniuses at work Guru Dutt - SDBurman - Hemant  & Sahir ) . I particularly like the Words " Humne Tho Jab Kaliyan Maangi Thi Kaaton ka Har Mila ( Whenever I asked for flowers , all I got in return were the Pricks of the Thorns ) . This Movie & song is almost a Auto biographical sketch of Both Sahir & Guru Dutt.  2. Kabhie Kabhie -- As much as he is known for his hard hitting lyrics , he has also penned some wonderful Romantic numbers . " Tu ab se pehle Sitaron main Bas Rahi Thi Kahin , Tujhe Zameen pe Bulaya Gaya hey mere liye ".   3. Abhi Na Jao (From Hum Dono) -- One of the best Duets I have listened to with both Rafi & Asha reigning supreme. The Lyrics are mesmerising as usual.   4. Yeh Desh hai Veer (Naya Daur) -- Patriotic Lyrics . This one is an ode to Bharat Matha.   5. Yeh Raat Yeh Chandini (Jaal) -- Hemant Kumar's soothing voice & wonderful lyrics of sahir . Listen to this "’laharon ke honThon pe dhiimaa dhiimaa raag hai bhiigii havaaon mein ThanDii ThanDii aag hai is hasiin aag mein tuu bhii jalake dekhale zindagii ke giit kii dhun badal ke dekhale "  6. Zindagi Bhar Nahin (Barsaat Ki Raat) -- One of Rafi's best Solos. Madhubala's looks ravishing but its Sahir who finally rules.                     And many many more. Will try to post more on such topics later.

        Case Study : How HP won $3 billion P&G outsourcing deal beating IBM and EDS   The Big Score It was a $3 billion race that Hewlett-Packard simply couldn't afford to lose. Winning would justify its grand strategy -- and prove that it could run with the big dogs. An inside look at an upset, and an upstart's guide to competition. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dan Talbott got the call on Christmas Eve. He was at his home in Plano, Texas, and was just sitting down to dinner with his wife and four kids when his cell phone rang. It was his boss, Mark Townsell, who heads business development in North and South America for Hewlett-Packard's computer-services division. Townsell got straight to the point: Procter & Gamble had decided to choose a blue-chip tech company to run its worldwide computer systems and data centers.The first hurdle would come in just three weeks, when a team of P&G executives would travel to HP's Palo Alto headquarters for a make-or-break series of meetings. They would decide whether HP had enough talent and experience even to bid on the contract, let alone win it.For Hewlett-Packard, the stakes couldn't have been higher. A big part of the rationale for the company's controversial acquisition of Compaq Computer was that it would catapult HP into the comparatively fast-growing computer-services business, one segment of the IT industry in which HP was decidedly a tier-two player. A brawnier Hewlett-Packard could compete for long-lasting, highly profitable contracts with giant customers like Procter & Gamble -- which in turn would help drive sales in HP's struggling personal-computer and server divisions. HP's dynamic chief executive, Carly Fiorina, had staked her career -- and the company's future -- on the takeover, and the deal's many critics were already declaring it a failure. Now -- six months after the Compaq acquisition was booked -- it was time to start showing results.  Procter & Gamble, the world's largest consumer-products company, would make for a rich prize. The $40 billion juggernaut markets 300 brands -- Bounty, Charmin, Clairol, Crest, Pampers, and Tide among them -- to some 5 billion consumers in more than 160 countries. Winning the contract to run P&G's IT infrastructure -- its central nervous system -- would give HP a critical beachhead in its battle against the industry's top guns, Electronic Data Systems and IBM. None of that was lost on Talbott. But even as he was taking in Townsell's pitch, Talbott was thinking about other, more immediate concerns.  A few inches over 6 feet and more than a few pounds over 200, Talbott is a Texas dynamo who seems to live on hot dogs and 18-hour workdays. He bears the pasty complexion of a man who has spent most of his working life in airports and conference rooms, and indeed, he has -- he's racked up 3 million miles on American Airlines alone. But while he's an IT-services-industry veteran who put in 23 years at EDS and 4 years at IBM, he's a rookie at HP. At the time of Townsell's call, he'd been with the Silicon Valley company for all of one month. He thrilled to the thought of battling for the P&G contract; accepting Townsell's challenge was a no-brainer. But he was still finding his way around the 141,000- person company, which boasts operations in 160 countries. He would have to bring all of HP's assets to the bargaining table. Could he accurately reflect HP's true capabilities?  Talbott bet that his alma maters EDS and IBM would join the fight for P&G and that both would bring on their A+ teams. Just a few months earlier, EDS was on the verge of signing an enormous, $8 billion contract to take over all of Procter's back-office operations, when P&G scuttled the deal at the eleventh hour. There was little doubt that a bruised and hungry EDS would be back in the hunt for this new, revised deal. IBM would be there too -- eager to grab another big chunk of market share. In going head-to-head with the industry's two giants, HP would compete for its very legitimacy. Talbott didn't need to be told: This was a must win.  After thanking Townsell for his confidence, Talbott hung up and announced to his family that P&G was in play. "You won't be seeing me for a while," he told his wife. And then, using the dealmaker's lingo for joining battle, he broke the news: "I'm going to engage." She didn't need a translation. She'd heard it before.  The $8 Billion Deal That Got Away Procter & Gamble's headquarters is topped by a pair of nearly conical, 16-story towers -- dubbed the "Dolly Parton" for obvious anatomical reasons -- that protrude over downtown Cincinnati. While P&G's lifetime spans three centuries, it's a relentlessly forward-looking organization -- a 166-year-old former soap and candle maker that is now extraordinarily technocentric. It's not unusual to lift the lid on a multinational company and find a farrago of incompatible software applications and systems. As recently as the late 1990s, EDS -- to take one not-so-random example -- was tangled up in 16 different email systems. P&G is an exception. Thanks to heavy investment in information technology, its activities are standardized, seamless, and deeply twined, in all 86 countries in which it operates. It uses its IT systems to gain competitive advantage and to focus on its core challenge: to make, pack, and ship billions of items a year. From 1999 to 2002, P&G estimates that it slashed $500 million by standardizing and globalizing its back-office operations. But by the company's own reckoning, that wasn't good enough.  In mid-2001, P&G embarked on a radical plan to outsource all of its back office -- not just IT, but finance and accounting, facilities management, HR, and purchasing. The stated goal was to streamline its structure and focus on developing and marketing products. But it's clear that the far more urgent aim was to cut costs. The plan was massively ambitious; it would make for the largest outsourcing contract ever. And it was massively disruptive; as part of the deal, more than 5,700 employees would be folded into the winning bidder. Many complained bitterly about the uncertainty of being forced to work for another company.  The bidding process, which pitted EDS against Dallas-based Affiliated Computer Services, lasted for 18 long months. Finally, on September 18, 2002, P&G told its employees to expect an announcement. It would award Plano, Texas based EDS a long-term contract valued at a staggering $8 billion. Randy Reedy, a vice president of P&G's IT team, was dispatched on a company jet to Manila to break the news in Asia. An hour outside of Osaka, Japan, the copilot tapped Reedy on the shoulder. He'd just received a message: They'd been ordered to head back to the states. Reedy was stunned. "What in the world is going on?" he blurted.  Back in Plano, all hell was breaking loose. EDS had just reported a disastrous third-quarter earnings miss. As part of the deal, P&G was due to take a big stake in EDS. Now, its executives watched in horror as investors sliced away $9.2 billion, or about 53%, of the company's market value. The P&G team huddled late into the night. At least one person broached the thought that they were about to ship 5,700 of their people to the "next Enron." At 1 AM, P&G chief A.G. Lafley called his EDS counterpart, then-CEO Dick Brown: P&G was putting the deal on hold. But for all intents, the contract was dead. Two months later, P&G ended talks with EDS. Even now, nearly a year later, Bobby Grisham, the EDS executive who headed the company's pursuit of P&G, can offer only this terse understatement on the $8 billion deal that got away: "It was tough."  The day after the deal imploded, executives at IBM and HP began strategizing about how to get a piece of P&G's action. HP, in particular, had closely monitored the race. It was already supplying a big chunk of P&G's computer systems -- an estimated 90% of its servers and 40% of its workstations -- and was desperate to protect that business. Eight days after P&G made its decision, Steve Huhn, a VP of sales for HP managed services, arranged for Carly Fiorina to call P&G's Lafley. Her message: HP services now had the critical mass to handle P&G. "One of the things we struggled with, after the Compaq merger, was that there was a lot of ignorance in the marketplace about what we could actually do," says Fiorina. "It was important to convey to A.G. that we had capabilities in this space that he might not be aware of -- and in fact, he wasn't aware of our capabilities. I wanted him to know that we were going to engage in the competition for his business."  In the harsh light of day, HP seemed clearly out of its league in a competition against EDS and IBM. Both HP and IBM hoped to convince the company to move away from a one-size-fits-all outsourcing strategy. Which is exactly what P&G did. It broke the contract into pieces -- employee services, facilities management, and so forth -- and bid out each chunk separately. It would start with the biggest, most critical slice of all: its worldwide computer-systems network.  Project Chantilly On January 2, Dan Talbott gathered his core pursuit team into a cavernous conference room at HP's Atlanta office building. Seated around a table were senior marketer Tom Simmons, client manager Mary Roth, and John Junker and Jim Alverdi, client reps who interact daily with P&G. As he looked at each of their faces, Talbott knew they were thinking, "There's no way we can win this deal."  In the harsh light of day, HP was clearly out of its league. Just consider the likely competition: IBM is a $81 billion behemoth in the services industry, with dozens of billion-dollar deals in its portfolio. EDS, which invented IT outsourcing when Ross Perot founded it in 1962, boasts $21 billion in annual sales. Despite its merger with Compaq, HP had yet to make its first multibillion-dollar score. At best, HP was the dark horse, and everyone in that Atlanta conference room knew it.  And HP wasn't in the race yet. Everything depended on the Palo Alto site visit, when P&G would determine whether HP had the right stuff even to compete for the deal. HP had to find a way to counter its greatest weakness: It had never taken on a customer of this size. P&G runs on 100,000 email-boxes, 78,000 workstations, 3,500 servers, and a farm of mainframes; the company's IT shop consists of 2,000 people in 53 countries.  On January 15, P&G's selection group arrived at HP's headquarters. Talbott and his team worked to convince P&G that HP could handle the "speeds and feeds" -- P&G's near-bottomless technical needs. The day culminated with a dinner at Chantilly, a Menlo Park restaurant, where they were to be joined by Ann Livermore, HP's head of global services. As Livermore drove into the restaurant's parking lot, she got a call on her cell phone. It was Talbott. "He said the meetings were going very well," she recalls. "What he really meant was, 'Don't blow it.' "  Livermore walked into a private dining room, and before she could grab a glass of wine, the P&G team strafed her with questions: Why should HP get this contract? Do you understand the significance of this undertaking? Can we rely on you when problems crop up? "They were looking for consistency," she says. "Were we consistent in our values, our beliefs, and our practices, from the front lines right on up to the executive level?" After a half-hour, someone from HP suggested that they sit down for dinner, where the questions could continue.  Then came the kicker. The door opened, and in walked Fiorina, who had slipped away from a Cisco board dinner in another part of the restaurant. Her appearance was completely unexpected -- even on the HP side -- and she spent about 20 minutes speaking with the P&G team. "I wanted them to understand, from the top, how important this opportunity was to us," she recalls. "At HP, we spend a lot of time thinking about who we do business with. P&G needed to know that we wouldn't be pursuing this if we didn't think we could add value -- and if we didn't think we could win."  It was an extraordinary session, with extraordinary stakes. If HP didn't make the cut, the market, in effect, would be sending the message that despite the Compaq acquisition, HP services still wasn't ready for prime time. "We were competing for our future," says Mary Rolf, who manages HP's relationship with P&G. "It would have been a tremendous setback if we hadn't gotten a slot in that final bidding process."  She needn't have worried. Two weeks later, P&G made it official when it chose IBM, EDS, and HP as the three companies that made the finals. Overjoyed, Talbott christened the HP pursuit team with a new name: Project Chantilly.  Making the Pig Fly On January 31, Talbott received a FedEx containing two 750 MB CDs: Procter & Gamble's RFP (request for proposals), which laid out the bidding process. He slipped the first disc into his PC and clicked on the timeline. His jaw dropped: Bids were due at P&G headquarters on March 28. A billion-dollar IT-outsourcing contract typically takes at least 9 to 12 months to bid out. P&G's do-or-die deadline allowed for just 56 days. Then he hit the print button, and got his second shock. Over the next hour, the two CDs chewed up two cases of paper. The RFP totaled more than 10,000 pages. "I was awestruck," he recalls. "The thing was massive, and there just wasn't the time to take it all in."  Two days later, on a Sunday afternoon, Talbott punched in John Crowther's cell-phone number, and found him with his wife and two daughters at a mall near their home in the Detroit suburbs. Crowther, a native of the UK, had put in 19 years at HP managed services and knew the division intimately. "Get on tomorrow's first flight to Cincinnati," Talbott told him. "You're going to be my bid manager."  Crowther set up a make-shift campaign headquarters in a scruffy HP facility in Blue Ash, Ohio, not far from P&G's U.S.-based global-data center. He spent the next two weeks recruiting help from all over the globe, a team that quickly grew to 80 people. At their first full-scale meeting, Jim Fischer, the lead technical architect, walked in with a stuffed toy -- a pink flying pig -- and tied it to the conference room ceiling. His message: "We might be the underdog, but we're going to make pigs fly on this deal."  Then Talbott stood up to speak. "We wouldn't have been selected if P&G wasn't comfortable with the notion that we could win, and the same holds true for EDS and IBM -- we're all starting at the same place," he told the team leaders. "The ultimate decision comes down to how we interact with the customer. In each of our meetings with P&G, there will be one of two possible outcomes: We move closer to the win column or we move closer to the lose column. Our job is to ensure that every conversation is a win."  Over at P&G's headquarters, the selection team and its advisers, the Houston-based IT-outsourcing consultancy TPI, began handicapping the three contenders. IBM was ultrafocused and played up its deep technical and outsourcing experience. Its learning curve was very short -- from day one, it understood 80% of P&G's systems and processes. On the downside, IBM proved to be less flexible than EDS and HP. "IBM treated us like a big, important customer, but they were somewhat paternalistic," says Reedy. "Their attitude was, 'Trust us, we know what we're doing.' " (Executives at IBM declined to comment on the record for this story.)  EDS garnered high marks for its operational excellence, and it proved to be an excellent listener. "EDS worked extraordinarily hard at trying to understand what was important to us," says Linda Clement-Holmes, the head of P&G's outsourcing initiative. "We'd make a suggestion, and it would show up in the next meeting's presentation." But EDS was hobbled by the bad corporate news that continued to break throughout the bidding.  As for HP, the biggest concern was the unknown: Could it really handle a deal of this magnitude? In the plus column, P&G already used HP hardware. And the P&G team was pleased by HP's frankness. "With HP, what you see is what you get," says Reedy. "They had less global experience than the other two and less experience in application development and maintenance, but they addressed those issues head-on. They didn't try to hide their weaknesses."  Whatever he told his team, Talbott privately believed that EDS was the front-runner. For starters, EDS had almost snared that mega-outsourcing deal. "EDS put a winning solution on the table," he says. "They lost only because of their external issues." What's more, over the previous 18 months, the EDS team had built up a deep relationship with the P&G side.  Talbott was somewhat comforted by his belief that EDS's greatest weakness played to HP's greatest strength. P&G's IT staffers were still alarmed at the thought of being farmed out to the troubled EDS (see Report From The Past, page 27). At every opportunity, HP's team leaders hammered away at the same message to P&G: "We value your people. We need their skills. They will have great careers at Hewlett-Packard." Talbott was convinced that the soft-and-fuzzy factor -- HP's culture -- just might help him do the hard work of winning this deal.  Stretch Run Working out of its Blue Ash headquarters, HP's pursuit team lived on a brutal, nearly round-the-clock schedule, with no time off on weekends. Their family lives were tested; at least one team leader reports that his marriage is in trouble. The stress took an enormous physical and mental toll. At a 7 AM breakfast meeting with his HR-team leader, Talbott watched in alarm as the man got up from the table, took a step, and keeled over from exhaustion.  HP got off to a shaky start. At the opening session, where the bidders had their first opportunity to clarify P&G's terms, a rattled HP submitted some 500 questions (compared with 50 from EDS and 150 from IBM). "HP is never going to get out of the weeds on this one," P&G's Clement-Holmes thought to herself. "They're just not going to survive."  But over the next few days, the HP side began to rally. As they prepared for the "Yellow Pad 2" session, when the bidders would present their first round of solutions, Talbott directed his team leaders to print out every PowerPoint slide -- more than 200 in all -- and tack each one up on the conference room's walls. Then the group critiqued them. "Dan Talbott is a fine leader, but he's a real pain in the ass when it comes to preparing presentations," says Crowther, who got his ears burned when he posted a generic slide that failed to convey a succinct message.  All through February and March, the corporate jets from EDS and IBM made frequent trips to Cincinnati. Talbott joked that the two IT-service-industry giants were like "a pair of Sumo wrestlers duking it out -- they weren't even aware of HP." (Grisham, EDS's president of operations solutions, denies that, but concedes, "We thought HP's lack of experience would really work against them.")  P&G's intention was to pick two finalists, who would then fight it out for the contract. But doing so would add months to the process. Forty-eight hours before HP submitted its bid, Fiorina and Livermore flew to Cincinnati on the company's Gulfstream jet. Talbott met them at the airport, and in the limo to P&G's headquarters, they settled on a plan to propose a fast-track offer to the selection team: Bypass the semifinals, select HP, and the company would commit to negotiating the final contract in record time.  The two HP executives met with Filippo Passerini, P&G's intense global business-services officer, and his team in a 16th-floor conference room. The session lasted for two hours. As it drew to a close, Fiorina made them a promise: "If you select HP, we will be your Wal-Mart." Her message struck a powerful chord. Wal-Mart is P&G's largest customer. P&G is Wal-Mart's biggest vendor. Neither can succeed without the other. "I was trying to convey, in pretty tangible terms, that I get it. We were competing for a bet-your-business relationship," says Fiorina. "And I wanted them to know: We intend to deliver."  The End Game On March 28, EDS, HP, and IBM turned in their bids in a series of three-ring binders that took up 6 feet of shelf space in Passerini's office -- and weighed in at 145 pounds. The selection team divided the responses into sections and sent them to 125 Procter experts around the world, who spent a weekend of all-nighters evaluating the documents. After several days of discussions, the six senior members of the selection team gathered to make the final call.  The meeting lasted most of a day. As each team member spoke, a consensus began to emerge. After a show of hands, the decision was unanimous. P&G would skip the intermediate step; HP was the winner. The reasons were many, but the one that closed the deal was this: HP wanted it the most. "HP was new to the market, they were very focused, and they were very, very hungry," says Andrew Hewat, TPI's lead consultant to P&G. On April 11, P&G broke the news: The company was awarding a $3 billion, 10-year IT services contract to HP. "IBM was absolutely stunned when they heard that we had won," Fiorina says.  Livermore trumpeted the P&G win with the somewhat disingenuous comment that HP is now a "legitimate alternative" to IBM. True, HP services became a $12 billion organization as a result of the Compaq merger, which allowed it to claim the industry's number three spot for total IT services. But that ranking is misleading, since it includes low-margin "break-fix" deals -- maintaining systems and running help desks. The real money is in the far more lucrative computer-services consulting and outsourcing arena, where HP ranks a distant seventh. Still, HP is now very much on EDS's and IBM's radar screens. "We reset the clock when we did the Compaq merger," says Livermore. "And all the momentum is on our side."  There's just one last item to settle in regard to the bidding for P&G: Did HP lowball the price to win the contract? HP won't disclose any numbers, but its executives insist that the P&G deal will be profitable in its first year. "The people who are saying we lowballed are the people who lost," says Fiorina. "They're using lowballing as an excuse to justify their own failure to show." Perhaps. But here's what's certain: HP's next big challenge is to manage P&G's expectations over the long haul. HP won the P&G deal, but now comes the tougher part: proving that it truly deserved to win. Every hour of the day, every day of the year, from now until August 2013, HP must deliver on its promises. All of the IT industry will be watching.  Sidebar: The Underdog's Guide to Competition Neither IBM nor EDS thought HP could beat them head-to-head. Wrong. Here are five rules for competing the HP way. 1. Don't hide your weakness. HP played up its strengths, but it didn't play down its obvious weaknesses. The company tackled them head on, which kept the competition from doing it instead.  2. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. Each interaction with the customer moves you closer to a win or closer to a loss. Rigorous self-criticism at HP put nearly every presentation to P&G in the win column.  3. Bring out the big guns. But conserve your ammo. At decisive moments, HP chief Carly Fiorina stepped into the fray. Her meetings with P&G were infrequent, but she made each one count.  4. Think like your customer. When Fiorina told P&G, "We will be your Wal-Mart," she gave a mental model of what a relationship with HP would be like -- P&G's rich, successful relationship with its biggest partner.  5. Show that you want the deal. "HP was new to the market . . . and they were very, very hungry," says a consultant to P&G. HP won because it wanted the most to win.

        Championing Chennai                                                                         Bangalore has an IIM. Hyderabad is home to the Wharton-Kellogg-parented ISB. Among the three southern knowledge economy cities, it's only Chennai that's missing a B-school. To change that, renowned Kellogg Professor Bala V. Balachandran is teaming up with influential fellow Tamils in the Chicago region (C.K. Prahalad and IMF economist Raghuram Rajan are two) to start the Great Lakes Institute of Higher Learning in Chennai. Slated to open in April 2004, the B-school looks to provide a cheaper alternative to ISB. "It's my way of giving something back to the state," says Balachandran.

        WEEKEND                         It turned out to be a rather Interesting & Different weekend. Having been recently elected to the Social Services Committee in my office, I had the pleasure of visiting a village 50kms to the south of NOIDA. It was wonderful to interact with the under-privileged children , some of whom had abundant talent unfortunately hidden inside the depths of Rural India . It was nice to see that there is a slow awareness on the need for Literacy & Dreams of making it big in hundreds of innocent eyes.                                                                It rained heavily on sunday in Delhi. But a few of us got together and played Cricket for 4-5 hours which was very refreshing & invigorating .

        Origination of the word BRAND                                             It is THE word for the marketing Hunchos.                                          Here is the interesting Trivia behind the word : In the 16th century, tavern owners and liquor distillers "burned" their name into barrels to differentiate themselves from cheaper substitutes. This move gave birth to this famous five-letter word (BRAND) in business,which plays a vital role in distinguishing one product from the other.

        MIT OpenCourseWare                                                                                  MIT has put its entire curriculum on the internet for free. Yes -really- F R E E ! (syllabus,lecture notes, assignments, exams... everything!) and is aptly called OpenCourseWare (or OCW). While one cannot get a degree out of going through these courses, it is a great place for anyone acquiring knowledge by self learning or teaching.   Quoting MIT's foreword:   " MIT and the OpenCourseWare team are excited to share with you a first sampling of course materials from MIT's Faculty. We invite educators around the world to draw upon the materials for their own curricula, and we encourage all learners to use the materials for self-study. " OCW is online since last year with currently about 32 courses out of its 2000 odd courses are currently available and online. MIT hopes to implement most of those 2000 odd courses by the end of year 2007.   That must be a tremendous feeling of hope for those who are always a student at heart, those who could never make it to MIT or dreaming it to be reading MIT's course material some day in their life. What a better way to educate the world than by OpenCourseWare. Most of all, what a brilliant idea, of selflessness and of breaking away from the conservative approach of learning or teaching -- truly laudable. Way to go MIT!   Relive your student life online with  urlLink MIT's OpenCourseWare   at http://ocw.mit.edu  P.S : Thanks to Aravinth for putting this post in our Corporate Intranet .

But Spam have eroded the credibility of the e-mail technology to a very large extent .                                                                       The Virus have seen a huge spurt this Fall & have become increasingly malicious & destructive. They have stopped ATM's from Working , Rendered Airline Reservation to a standstill & have even challenged the Security of most nations.

        MARRIAGE HUMOR                                     Marriage Humor has always remained Popular and here are some Classic one-liners :   1. Bachelors should be heavily taxed. It is not fair that some men should be happier than others -- Oscar Wilde  2. I don't worry about terrorism. I was married for two years -- Sam Kinison  3. When a newly married couple smiles, everyone knows why. When a ten-year married couple smiles, everyone wonders why.  4. When a man opens the door of his car for his wife, you can be sure of one thing: either the car is new or the wife.  5. We always hold hands. If I let go, she shops.  6. Love is blind but marriage is an eye-opener.

        TRAVEL DIARY :  VRINDAVAN - AGRA - BHARATPUR - FATEHPUR SIKRI - MATHURA                                                                                                              A mixture of Religion & Architechture & Wildlife , this trip did turn out to be quite memorable & equally hectic . We (a Group of Seven)started off on a Saturday Morning 6 am in a Mahindra Scorpio. The SUV (Car of the Year -2002 ) didn't Disappoint us with its luxurious interiors & smooth Drive. The first stop was at Vrindavan which is Situated 100 kms to the South of Delhi .    VRINDAVAN  : Vrindavan is the Seat of the ISKCON movement & the city where Lord Krishna enthralled the world with his childhood antics. You are Greeted by the Fully Marble ISKCON Temple as you enter the city . The ISKCON Temple Looks beautiful & Bhajans are performed Continuously here. We then Headed to the Rangaji Temple inside the city. The Rangaji temple is a perfect Iyengar temple with a Huge Gopuram and a sprawling Corridor . Interestingly all the priests inside this temple are Tamilians . The thing which puts you off is the constant pester of people posing themselves as Guides ( These people take you inside the Banke-Bihari Temple where the supposed priest forces you to Donate money which is a highly unethical practice in vogue there ) .    AGRA  : We Reached Agra by around 1pm . Agra lies 200 Kms to the South of Delhi . We were ravenously hungry and were glad to find some excellent South Indian food in Dasaprakash Hotel ( Its near to the Meher Cinema Complex) . We then Headed to the Agra Fort . The Agra Fort had been the Mughal Citadel for a long time and is quite huge. The Moats around the Fort are quite deep & wide and the entire fort is reminscent of the Red fort because of its striking resemblance in Architechture & Colour. Shah Jahan  was kept as a prisoner here by his son Aurangazeb & spent his last years here looking at his beloved Taj Mahal From his prison cell. The Top of the Fort and Shah Jahan's Prison offers wonderful views of the Taj Mahal which stands perched majestically  across the winding Yamuna River . Diwan - i - Am ( Place of Public Audiences) & Diwan-i-Khas ( Place of Private Audience) are some of the other common Mughal places found here . Jahan Ara , Shah Jahan's Daughter looked afer him during his final years and her palace is adjacent to his prison cell . There is a also a Sound & Light show in the evening ( Both in Hindi & English - Pls check the winter & summer timings ) , which describes the history of the Fort .                                        We then Headed to the Taj Mahal . Security is very tight Outside and no Electronic items ( Except Cameras ) are allowed inside the Taj . The Taj looks awesome. No adjectives can do justice to its majestic beauty & Grandeur . The Govt in recent years has done a good job in Beautification of Taj ( particularly in De-sulphurisation ) by Banning commercial vehicles within 3 Kms radius  . Time just rushes as you keep admiring Taj's beauty from various angles. Inside is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal & Shah Jehan . Shah Jahan started the Construction of Taj on the death of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal in 1631. It took 17 years to complete Taj Mahal & its no wonder that it is listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the World.                                                   Some of us then decided to head to the Keoladeo Ghana Bird Sanctuary in Bharatpur , Rajasthan the next day morning to do some Bird-watching. Its been just a few months since I have got interested in Bird-watching . Got hooked to it thru a friend of mine who was also kind enough to lend me "The Book of Indian Birds "By the renowned Ornithologist , Salim Ali .   BHARATPUR  :  We left  Agra at 4.30 am & Reached Bharatpur at 5.45 am . Bharatpur is located in Rajasthan & lies 60 kms to the west of Agra . The Keoladeo Ghana ( Khaleodeo is the name of the God in the Ancient temple located in the Midst of the Sanctuary & Ghana means Dense Forest) Bird Sanctuary is open from 6 am to 6 pm. We started early since the best time to catch sight of Birds is Early morning. Rs.25 per head is the entry fee to the Sanctuary & Re.50 for the Vehicle. However vehicles have to be parked 2 kms inside the sanctuary from where either you could take bicycles on Rent or hire a Rickshaw & we merrily opted for the former. Do not forget to get Binoculars ( you can however rent one if you dont have ) & a camera ( Preferably a SLR) . Since it was post monsoon season there was plenty of water in the lakes & marshes , creating a brimming verdant environment . The august-September is the nesting season of the Birds . However the best time is November - December when you can find plenty of migratory birds (Including the rare Siberian Crane) and hatched chicklings. We spotted a huge colony of Painted storks & Cormorants . Further ahead there were plenty of Herons , Ducks , Spoonbills ,egrets , Ibises, Kingfishers ,  Peacocks & Chitals . The dense forest is also reputed to house the Pythons , Civet cats , Otters , Sambhars & migratory birds like Pelicans , Spanish Sparrow, Coot Snipes, Rosy Pelican and Flamingo .                                                               We Spent three Hours Cycling all around the Park enjoyed some Breath-taking views & I finally cut my teeth in to some Bird-watching which I had been intending to do for some time. We reached Back agra and had lunch at a nice udupi Hotel in Agra before heading to Fatehpur Sikri .    FATEHPUR SIKRI  : Fatehpur Sikri was the Capital City built by Akbar in the 16th century. However it was later plagued by water problems and was eventually deserted after his death.It looks majestic from a Distance and offers some great views from the Top. We were welcomed by the Giant Buland Darwaza on entering the ruined city .It is fully constructed out of Red Sandstone with intricate carvings. The places to see are the  Jodhabai Palace ( Hindu wife of Akbar & mother of Jehangir) , Maryam Palace (Akbar's goan Christian Wife) , Birbal Bhavan, Diwan-i-Am , Diwan-i-Khas , Treasury & the Panch Mahal. Adjacent to this is the magnificent Jama Masjid which has a  wide Corridor with a lovely pool in the center.                          The sad thing that you will notice on the way to Fatehpur Sikri is the Cruel domestication of Bears to entertain the Tourists & for Spiritual Practices.. The bears are chained and expected to perform tricks & dance to amuse the tourists. Please desist from encouraging such despicable acts & I sincerely hope the Wildlife Organizations & the Govt of India put a full stop to this heinous crime.    SIKANDRA  : It is located 4 kms from Agra and houses the Mausoleum of Akbar. Its a beautiful place with lush Green Grass having spotted Deers & Peacocks. The Tomb represents Akbar's Multi-religious faith & has the Influence of Buddhist , Islam , Christian & Hindu Architechture.    MATHURA  : Lord Krishna was Born here in a Prison cell according to the Myth. Its a small room where Bhajans are held continuously . Mathura bears a striking resemblance to Ayodhya , because even it has a mosque just adjacent to the temple and hence there is an unprecedented security surrounding the area. Adjacent to the Krishna Janma Bhoomi is a lovely temple ( Reminscent of the Architechture of Puri Jagannath ) . We then headed back to Delhi and capped it with some Great food at Saravana Bhavan , Connought Place. The trip turned out to be quite memorable because of some informative & humorous friends who made the whole ambience lively .    TRAVEL TRIPS  : The best time to make this trip is November,December (esp for Bharatpur) . The Best way to make this trip is either on your own Car or on a Rented one. The per head expenses for this weekend sojourn would turn out to be Rs.1500 per head. Please carry Binoculars,Camera, Woollen Wear (in Winter) , Travel Guide, Bird List Book & a Road Map. The major annoyance during the Trip are the Self-proclaimed Experts & guides at all the places who pester you . Unless you feel you need a Guide , Your Travel Guide ( The best is LONELY PLANET INDIA GUIDE) should be more than Sufficeint in explaining to you the History & details of the all the Landmarks and also help you in navigating through them .Taj & Bharatpur will remain permanently etched in my memory for a long time to come.

        SARISKA - Afterthoughts                                               There were a few things which have been nagging me ever since the Visit to Sariska Tiger Reserve.   1. Why do they have a Village deep inside the Sanctuary ?   2. Why do they allow two wheelers/ four wheelers ( What protection do human beings have against animals  & vice versa it becomes easier for poachers to get inside ) inside the Sanctuary ?   3. There is no signboard saying "No Honking"and the external vehicles disturb the animals by honking & shouting inside .                                           If the Govt is serious about Wildlife Conservation then let it act before its too late .

Though I still have a lot to learn abt SLR Photograhy , I am quite happy with some of the snaps (Particularly of Sunrise & Animal shots ) that have come out. I intend to put them online in Yahoo Photos quite soon & will provide the link to that from here.

        TN Tourism                             I was pleasantly surprised to see a Supplement with Today's TOI & ET about Tamil Nadu Tourism. There were some good write-ups on the Tourist Destinations in TN with some wonderful photographs. Its heartening to see that the TN Govt has become proactive in promoting Tourism in the State.                             However was suprised to see that a few big destinations were missing from the list ( Thiruvannamalai for instance) . Also there is no mention about the Wildlife Sanctuaries in TN ( Like Mundanthurai & Kalakkadu among others ) .

        PHREAKER                           Phreaker seems to be the Telecom Industry equivalent of an Hacker . Found this on the Merriam Webster Site.   phreaker \FREE-ker\ noun : one who gains illegal access to the telephone system    Did you know? "Phreakers" are modern day troublemakers who specialize in attacks on the telephone system. The word, which became popular in the mid-1980s, is probably a combination of the words "phone" and "freak." ("Phreakers" are also known as "phreaks" or "phone phreaks.") A "phreaker" can use either low-tech means, such as whistling or using an instrument to mimic the tones the phone system utilizes to route calls and identify payment, or the more high-tech tactic of breaking into and manipulating the phone company's computer system. Their purpose is often to make long-distance or other expensive calls without paying, although some phreakers seem more interested in causing damage or havoc simply for the sake of doing so.

        SARISKA - TIGER RESERVE                                                The onset of Winter in Delhi is the start of the Wildlife season in the north where Most Sanctuaries open post monsoons. We ( I , Aravinth & Durai) Decided to try Sariska Tiger Reserve located 200 Kms from Delhi near Alwar in Rajasthan. We started on a Saturday morning & inspite of the bad roads managed to reach Sariska by 11.30 am . Sariska Tiger Reserve lies 35 kms from Alwar . It is one the Project Tiger Reserves & has 35 tigers and 65 Leopards.                                                 We were lucky to spot a young Doctor couple who agreed to join us for the Open jeep Ride inside the Sanctuary . The Open Jeep ride lasted 3.5 Hours late in the afternoon and we spotted Plenty of Peacocks , Hanuman Langurs , Nilgais , Spotted Deers , Sambhars , Wild Boars in their Natural Habitat . We were also lucky to spot a mini chase sequence Between a couple of Jackals & Nilghais . I was extrememly luck to Spot a leaopard stealthily following a Nilghai . There was considerable excitement in the park after that but we never spotted the leopard in the open after that . We thoroughly enjoyed the Trip nevertheless spotting plenty of ungulates & peacocks all over the Sanctuary.  The Doctor couple decided to join us for the rest of the Journey and it was wonderful having them since they were great company.                                      We then headed to Talbraksha Sulphur springs which lie 20 Kms from Sariska. The place was extremely serene & pristine (There is not even electricity in this village) and the Sulphur springs were very hot emanating from the earth . There was some excitement there too when the Hanuman langur started yelling panic calls after spotting a leopard but once again our long wait didn't yield a leopard spotting. We made some bonfire , sang songs & had a nice Dinner (Maize & bajra rotis which were very tasty ) and went to sleep.                                      Next morning we got up early & took some good sunrise photos amidst flying pigeons and made a short trip to a closeby Jheel where we saw some Turtles & aquatic birds. We then took bath in the Hot Sulphur Springs in the Temple ( These springs are supposed to cure Skin ailments ) and then started for Silserh Lake.  The Silserh lake is located 15 Kms from Alwar & is spectacular. Its easily one of the biggest lakes I have seen set amidst the backdrop of the beautiful Aravalli mountains. We also visited a Place called Garhwaji , which is located 8 kms from Silserh & is a place far away from Tourists. It had a small waterfall & wonderful hill views . Boating was pleasant in the Silserh lake & we also had a rather expensive Lunch at the RTDC Hotel there . We came back to Alwar where we saw the Ruined fort. The alwar fort is completely in ruins , the only existing structure is the spawling Fortress wall.                                  The Palace is just closeby , but is maintained in a very poor state. The Tank of the palace sadly is inhabited by pigs now . The Palace I am sure would once have been a magnificent structure because it has a huge hall of public audience & wonderfully ornate carvings. We then went to the main market of Alwar where we bought some Milk sweets ( From Thakur Das sweet Shop in Hop Circus which is reputedly famous for this ) and then dropped the Doctor Couple at the Railway station and headed back to Delhi. We found a better road route this time via Daruweria & reached Delhi by around 10.30 pm.                                   The excitement of seeing wild animals in their Natural habitat is an immensely exciting & satisfying experience. The people of Rajasthan are one of the most Courteous & tourist friendly that I have ever seen.    TRAVEL TIPS  : The best time to Visit any Wildlife sanctuary is November - January & March - June. During the Summer the thirsty animals come to the waterholes and hence its easier to spot them ( But then Delhi during Summer is terribly hot too at 42-45 c ) . Make sure you book the Jeeps in Advance during the peak periods. Always carry a Binocular & a good camera . Observe utmost silence & keep your eyes trained to spot any movement. Most Sanctuaries have very good guides ( or in most cases the drivers themselves are good guides) & always take either an early morning trip or a late afternoon trip becase thatz when chances of spotting wildlife are high. But then at the end of all this , you have to be extremely lucky to spot a Tiger & hence pray to all your favourite gods before venturing out !!!

        POKEMON                              Was talking to my cousin the other day ( He is just 6 years old but is an authority in cars !!) . Asked him what were the new cars he has seen recently . He replied "I am not crazy abour cars anymore , I am crazy only about Pokemon".                            Remember reading in the Newspapers sometime back that Pokemon is the latest craze among pre-teens . I have very little idea of what Pokemon is , but there is a lot we could infer from What age groups ---  do what , to learn about the emerging culture .

        DIWALI - North Vs South                                                Happy Diwali all !! I was discussing about Diwali with my Colleague yesterday ( He is a Punjabi) & found out that in the North,  Diwali is Celebrated commomorating Ram's return to Ayodhya after the 14 Years of exile. Ask any south Indian & he will tell you Diwali is celebrated because Lord Krishna killed Narakasura . Strange that such a paradox exists within the same country !! Probably thatz the reason why India is a land of unity in Diversity ..

        IN DEFENSE OF GOD                                                                        One of the fwd mails that I received. But this one caught my attention & is thought provoking.   An atheist professor of philosophy speaks to his  class on the problem science has with Krishna.  He asks one of his new students Gopal  to stand and.....  Professor: You are a Hare Krishna  devotee, aren't you, son? Gopal:  Yes, sir.  Prof: So you believe in  God? Gopal: Absolutely, sir.  Prof: Is God good? Gopal:  Sure.  Prof: Is God all-powerful? Gopal:  Yes.  Prof: My brother died of cancer even  though he prayed to Krishna to heal him. Most of us would attempt to help others  who are ill. But Krishna didn't. How is this Krishna good then?  Hmm? (Gopal  is silent.)  Prof: You can't answer, can you?  Let's start again, young fella. Is God good? Gopal:Yes.  Prof: Is Satan  good? Gopal:No.  Prof: Where does Satan come  from? Gopal: From...God...  Prof: That's right. Tell me son, is  there evil in this world? Gopal: Yes.  Prof: Evil is everywhere, isn't it?  And God did make everything. Correct? Gopal: Yes.  Prof: So who created  evil? (Gopaldoes not answer.)  Prof: Is there sickness? Immorality?  Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the world, don't  they? Gopal:Yes, sir.  Prof: So, who created them? (Gopal  has no answer.)  Prof: Tell me, son. Do you believe in  Krishna? Gopal:Yes, professor, I do.  Prof: Science says you have 5 senses  you use to identify and observe the world around you. Have you ever seen  Krishna? Gopal:  No, sir.  Prof: Tell us if you have ever heard  your Krishna? Gopal: Yes , sir.  Prof: Have you ever felt your  Krishna, tasted your Krishna, smelt your Krishna? Have you ever had any sensory  perception of Krishna or God for that matter? Gopal: No, sir. I'm afraid I  haven't.  Prof: Yet you still believe in  Him? Gopal: Yes.  Prof: According to empirical,  testable, demonstrable protocol, science says your Krishna doesn't exist. What  do you say to that, son? Gopal:Nothing. I only have my faith.  Prof: Yes. Faith. And that is the  problem science has.  Gopal: Professor, is there such a  thing as heat? Prof: Yes.  Gopal:And is there such a thing as  cold? Prof: Yes.  Gopal: No sir. There  isn't.  (The lecture theatre becomes very  quiet with this turn of events.)  Gopal: Sir, you can have lots of  heat, even more heat, superheat, mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no  heat. But we don't have anything called cold. We can hit 458 degrees below zero  which is no heat, but we can't go any further after that. There is no such thing  as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot  measure cold. Heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir just the absence of it.  (There is pin-drop silence in the  lecture theatre.)  Gopal: What about darkness,  Professor? Is there such a thing as darkness? Prof: Yes. What is night if there  isn't darkness?  Gopal: You're wrong again, sir.  Darkness is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light,  bright light, flashing light.....But if you have no light constantly, you have  nothing and it's called darkness, isn't it? In reality, darkness isn't. If it  were you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn't you?  Prof: So what is the point you are  making, young man?  Gopal: Sir, my point is your  philosophical premise is flawed.  Prof: Flawed? Can you explain  how?  Gopal: Sir, you are working on the  premise of duality. You argue there is life and then there is death, a good God  and a bad God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite, something  we can measure. Sir, science can't even explain a  thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully  understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant  of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing. Death is not the  opposite of life: just the absence of it. Now tell me, Professor. Do you teach  your students that they evolved from a monkey?  Prof: If you are referring to the  natural evolutionary process, yes, of course, I do. Gopal :  Have you ever observed  evolution with your own eyes, sir?  (The Professor shakes his head with a  smile, beginning to realize where the argument is going.) Gopal : Since no one has ever  observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this  process is an on-going endeavour, are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are  you not a scientist but a preacher? (The class is in  uproar.)  Gopal : Is there anyone in the class  who has ever seen the Professor's brain? (The class breaks out into  laughter.) Gopal : Is there anyone here who has  ever heard the Professor's brain, felt it, touched or smelt it?.....No one  appears to have done so. So, according to the established rules of empirical,  stable, demonstrable protocol, science says that you have no brain,  sir.  With all due respect, sir, how do we  then trust your lectures, sir? (The room is silent. The professor  stares at the student, his face unfathomable..)  Prof: I guess you'll have to take  them on faith, son. Gopal : That is it sir.. The link  between man & god is FAITH. That is all that  keeps things moving & alive

        ONLINE BIDDING                                   Delhi to Chennai is quite far . The Domestic Air Travel market has witnessed a tremendous boost thanks to the Apex fares Concept started a few months ago. It has made flying affordable to the Upper Middle class which otherwise has been used to travelling in the 2nd/3rd AC's by Train.                                     Sahara has gone a step ahead and introduced online bidding in partnership with indiatimes.com. I was pleasantly surprised when I won a Bid Yesterday for Delhi-Chennai at a price of Rs.2925 (The actual Cost by Jet is Rs.11300 !!) . It has now thrown open the doors for numerous people who otherwise cannot afford the steep air charges. Long live Bidding !! Long live low airfare flying !!

        SULTANPUR BIRD SANCTUARY                                                                                    Its the start of the Delhi Winter which means that its one of the best time for Bird-Watching. Though its a little too early , 4 of us decided to catch up on some Bird Watching at Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary which is located 60 Kms from Delhi in Haryana.                                                              We started at 5.30 am from Noida and reached Sultanpur by 7 am. It was still chilly at 7 am and we were greeted by a Deserted parking lot at Sultanpur. The Sultanpur Jheel is a wonderful Bird Watching spot and the total walk around the Circumference of the Jheel is around 6.5 kms. We saw a lot of Birds like Cattle Egret ,painted Stork , King fishers , eagles, parakeets , Ibises , Spoonbills,Herons etc. I made some good use of my SLR camera . It took us around three hours to walk through the entire Circumference and it was a Pleasant walk thanks to the Weather and cheerful friends . There is also a small museum near the entrance which has some good photgraphs & description of the aquatic birds there.                                                 From there we headed to Sohna ( Its 25 kms from Gurgaon) , which is famous for its hot springs. We visited the Shiv Kund where hot water was springing from the ground and pilgrims take bath in the temple . The Hot spring water is supposed to be a curative , curing you of all your skin ailments. We then reached Gurgaon and spent a few hours in the malls. They were all Glitzy & the parking system there is very well organised reminding me of the ones I have seen in the US Airports.                                            We visited the Qutub Minar in the evening and took some nice snaps. Started by Quub-ud-din Aibak , it was completed by Iltumish later. Constructed 800 Years ago it still stands tall and is one of the most important landmarks of Delhi. The incomplete Alai-Minar is right next to it.                                                It was a nice one day outing & we were glad to have covered so many places in a day and returned by around 6 pm to Noida.

".                                                        We all live in a Chaotic world. We miss appointments , have our fears , have all kinds of complexes (Superior / inferior) , Do some mundane work , try to enjoy life superficially .....the list goes on .... And as the title goes we are all trying to find a structure amidst chaos ...

        IS DELHI THE MOST UNSAFE CITY FOR WOMEN ?                                                Everyday when I read the newspaper , I wonder if there is another city where there is more Crime against Women ? Delhi leads the list with all kinds of heinous crimes committed against Women. Its ironical that the National Capital has been setting such a bad example ..

        NEWSPAPERS                               The Quality of newspapers reflect the face of a city to a larger extent. The Indian Metros have been divisive on the issue of Newspapers. TOI is a near Monopoly in Mumbai , while The Hindu dominates Madras (Chennai) , Delhi has a tough Competition between TOI & HT while Calcutta has the Telegraph & Statesman .                             I have been observing a paradigm shift in news reporting both in Newspapers & in Magazines over the last few years. I am not too sure if its the changing times but the News is increasingly focussing on Glamour & glitter than on actual content. There is very less fodder for the Intellect & more for the eyes in glamour photos & P3P's. More on this later . But its definitely time to Ponder ........

        CRAZY DRIVE                             The Cough & cold still persists but that didn't deter me from making a Evening trip to Gurgaon on Saturday. Gurgaon is the Call Center Capital of the world and has plush malls & makes you wonder if you live in India . We went there late in the Night to take some Night shots with my new Camera of the Glitzy malls and active night life. It was quite cold and Venkat ( This Guy is one heck of a Driver , He drives Two wheeler like a F-1 Driver !!) & I travelled 120 kms(to & fro) on a two wheeler .  The photos have come out quite well although I still need to learn a lot on night photos.

        SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY                                          As an Elected member of the Social Services Committee in my office , I had the privilege to Visit a Couple of Schools in S.Delhi being Run by Deepalaya an NGO for the Slum & under-privileged Children. The Children were really cute & full of talent. Such trips have really been a eye-opener for me as to how much needs to be still done for the upliftment of Destitutes & poor. I feel as if I live in a Parallel world full of Glitz & glamour (Most of us are unaware of the Society around us ) , whereas I hardly live 10 kms away from these Slums. We are hoping to do some Volunteer work for them on weekends & also some Material / Monetary Contribution.                                          Such Visits leave you deeply questioning your priorities in life & purpose of Humanity in General. We have to admit that we owe something back to the Society & let us all start making some Contribution , however minor it is , to make a Difference to the Society & make the world a better living place.

        FORGOTTEN MD - Ramlal                                 Saw this  urlLink Article  , when I was browsing Screen's website. Ramlal scored music for a few V.Shantaram Movies in the 60's . One of his songs "Tum to Pyar Ho Sajni" has always been one of my favourites. In fact when I was young , I had this Taped Chitrahar cassette which had these songs Tum to Pyaar Ho & Pankh Hote to ud aati Re (I understood very little Hindi then !!) & I  was very fascinated by the music.

        HOW TO NAME IT                                                                  I was listening to How to name it by Illayaraja and was wondering if it was ahead of its times , when it was released in the mid 80's. Illayaraja shows why he is called the maestro with skillful & wonderful use of Stringed Instruments to create a delight for the ears. There has never been a question about his Genius but this Album didn't become too famous with the masses but just ended up in the shelves of the classes.                                                  Particularly his usage of Violin in this Album is awesome.

        ORIGIN OF THE TERM SCAPEGOAT                                                              Found this interesting piece of info about the Term Scapegoat .As we know Scapegoat is one who bears the Blame for others.                                                The history of "scapegoat" is based on a linguistic misunderstanding. On Yom Kippur, the ancient Hebrews would sacrifice one goat for the Lord and lead another one into the wilderness bearing the sins of the people. The ceremony is described in Leviticus, where it is said that one lot shall be cast for the Lord and one for "Azazel." Modern scholars usually interpret "Azazel" as being the name of a demon living in the desert. But ancient biblical translators thought "Azazel" referred to the goat itself, apparently confusing it with the Hebrew phrase  "‘ēz ’ōzēl," meaning "goat that departs." The mistranslation was carried through Greek and Latin into a 16th-century English translation, where the goat was rendered as "scapegoat"; that is, "goat that escapes."

        FOOD HABITS                              Once a Madrasi , forever a Madrasi . Its been almost 6 Years since I have left Madras . I have lived in Various Cities throughout India & also spent a few years in the US . I now watch more Hindi / English Movies than Tamil , Follow the National/International Politics much more than the state politics but if there is one thing that hasn't changed is my craving for Madrasi Food.                                   I have never been & never will be a big fan of Chappathi/Roti cuisine and my countless trips in the NCR Region in search of good south Indian food would be testimony to that fact. Idli still remains my favourite breakfast !!. This weekend had some Great food at a friend's place & also had a wonderful dinner in Delhi. All these culinary musings are perhaps an afterthought of such good food :-)

        ZOOS                       Is it ethical for Human beings to restrict the free movement of Animals by putting them inside a cage ? Animals have as much rights as we have for freedom and its high time that Mankind respects it. Apart from this , most Zoos are sub-standard and end up torturing and killing the animals much before their Lifespan. Here is an  urlLink Article  from the Guardian.

        A TALE OF TOO MANY CITIES - MADRAS (CHENNAI)                                                     I have been meaning to write this post for a long time but never got enough time to sit & pen it down. Having Lived / Worked in numerous cities in India ( & probably a few in the US ) , I have always been fascinated by Cities. The hustle & bustle of the Cities and its unique characteristics make up for an interesting study & I have also noticed the possessiveness people have about their home towns. I am trying to present my opinion on the Cities where I have lived / worked . My presumption is that you need to live at least for 6 months in a city to understand and write about its Merits & Demerits. The following Cities fall under that Criteria : Madras (Chennai) , Bangalore , Hyderabad , Mumbai , Pune , Ahmedabad , Delhi since I have lived in these cities for close to or greater than six months. I will do it as a SWOT (Strengths,Weaknesses , Opportunities,Threats) Analysis.    1. MADRAS (CHENNAI) :     LIKES :   First things first , I still refer to Chennai as Madras , which shows how possesive I am about the City . Afterall I spent twenty years there and owe most of what I am today to Madras. The Best thing I like about Madras is the Respect & Stress on Education and a very Vibrant Intellectual / Cultural / Religious fervour. Its one of the Best Cities to Study boasting of wonderful schools & colleges and with tremendous stress on Intellectual progress. The Carnatic music season in December is one of its kind in the world and the musical experience of December could never be recreated anywhere else in the world. The people are very religious & career oriented. Of course last but not least its the Home of Idli,vada,sambhar,Dosas,filter coffee, offering excellent choice of food to satisfy the taste buds. The HINDU still remains my favourite newspaper.    DISLIKES :  Climate , Poor Infrastructure (Bad roads, Water Scarcity) , Narrow Minded people bordering a bit on being too selfish , Sky High Expectations ( If you haven't studied at IIT/IIM's or If you aren't working for one of the Big Tech cos or If you are not in abroad/at least gone there  then you haven't acheived much in life as per Tam-Bram lingo !!) , Political Scenario .    PLACES TO SEE :  Marina Beach ( The Second largest in the World ) , Besant Nagar Beach , Valluvar Kottam , Museum , Crocodile/Snake Park , Vandalur Zoo ,  Mahabalipuram , Numerous Adventure parks on Old Mahabalipuram Road , Parthasarathy Temple(triplicane) , Kapaleeshwarar Temple (mylapore),32 foot Hanuman Temple (Nanganallur) , Santhome Church .    STRENGTHS :  Wonderful City for Education , Hospitals (perhaps the best in India ) , Culture (Though Unique to Tamilians) , Religion . One of the vertex of the Silicon valley Triangle ( Alongwith Hyd,Blore) boasting of most of top tech cos , Also called the Detroit of India ( Ford , Hyundai , Delphi and many more lined up) emerging as the Auto Capital of India , Tremendously Organized Retail business ( Silk Sarees , Jewellery ) , High Literate population , Natural Harbour and International Airport , Excellent Public Transport ( Buses,Trains) , Reasonable cost of Living .    WEAKNESSES :  Climate ( Hot almost throughout the Year . In Fact I joke saying Madras has three kinds of climate Hot,Hotter,Hottest) , Language ( Though things have changed in the last few years still viewed as Anti-Hindi State) , Poor Political Landscape ( more than three Decades of Dravidian Govt has left the State away for the mainstream Politics & also neither of the parties have done enough to foster growth or tap the potential ) , Poor Infrastructure ( Water Scarcity , Poor Roads , Drainage problems ) still haunt the city , The Chennai Autowallah continues to remain the most unreasonable person on earth.    OPPORTUNITIES :  Tremedous Growth is possible in IT , ITES , Auto,Health,Retail Sectors . But Unfortunately the Govt isn't doing enough to promote the State's interests . A key City in the arena of Health Tourism boasting of World Class Hospitals like Apollo , Malar , Madras Medical Mission , Madras Medical College. Cultural Tourism should be promoted & publicized viz the December carnatic music festival ( Which already attracts a lot of Tourists from India & abroad) .    THREATS :  The neighbouring CM's are very proactive & have managed to attract most of intended FDI to TN to their states (Naidu & Krishna) , Bangalore & Hyd pose a very strong Threat to Chennai providing superior Infrastructure & facility , Language ( The earlier we join the national Bandwagon the better it is for us ) , Chennai should quickly address & solve its Infrastructure problems to overcome threats from other Metros.                                                      Watch out for more as I would be covering the other cities in the days to come.

        LIFE COULD BE CRUEL                              There are some moments in life when you are left speechless by Grief & shock. I had one such moment yesterday & realised how cruel life could be.                               It all started a few weeks back when I saw a posting in our Company Intranet asking for a Blood Donor (B Positive Grp)to donate to a two year old kid immediately in need of Blood. I contacted the colleague who had posted it since my Blood Group was B positive . She immediately took me to the Hospital where the Kid was Admitted. I learnt that the kid was suffering from a sudden drop in Blood platelets & the Doctors were suspecting an initial cancer growth. When I visited the kid , he was tenuously holding to his mother's dupatta and sleeping on her Lap (Seems he didn't want to leave his mother and wanted to sleep that way and not on the Bed) . However another Donor's Blood matched and hence they told me mine wasn't needed. I left the Hospital giving them my Contact numbers and asking them to contact me in case they needed more Blood. I felt an overwhelming sympathy for that kid and their family and wished all would get well.                                                I met my colleague a week later and she informed me that the Kid had been shifted to AIIMS since he had Cancer and they were considering chemotherapy to cure the ailment . I met her again accidentally yesterday and asked her how the kid was doing. She answered that the boy had died Yesterday because the Cancer had spread very fast and he had developed numerous other complications like pneumonia . I was left numb with shock and the image of the boy kept flashing in my mind throughout yesterday .

        QUE SERA SERA                                    A few years back I remember seeing the Alfred Hitchcock movie "The man who knew too Much" , starring James Stewart & the ravishing Doris Day which had this immortal song"Que Sera Sera ". I knew the song was extremely popular and of course the movie was one of Hitchcocks's classics.                                   However I read this phrase in Todays newspaper and did some googling to find out what it means .  Que sera sera means "Whatever will be will be " . Probably the apparent reference is to a more Philosophical & fatalistic view of the future .

        PHILIPS 5-IN-1 PLAYER                                                I got myself a Philips 5-in-1 Player ( Which can play MP3,VCD,ACD,TAPE,RADIO) on Sunday . My Huge Collection of cassettes & CD's have finally found an avenue now . Now that Winter has set in Delhi , I would be forced to curb most of my Outdoor Travel and hence thought of gifting myself this player.                                                 I have always believed Philips is a Wonderful value for Money. All my previous Audio systems have been Philips and they have been very long lasting and the sound effects have also been equally impressive ( Well Sony,Kenwood Belong to a Different Category but then I don't want to spend that much money).

        CAT's out of the Bag                                         It came as a big Shock when I read in Today morning Newspapers that the CAT papers had been leaked and the exam stands Cancelled. I didn't know the news the whole of Yesterday . I thought the CAT paper this year was a bit easy than the one I had given earlier and I was also surprised when they asked us to take the question paper back with us .                               Now the CAT is likely to be rescheduled in the month of Jan according to newspapers , but this is a Big shock for most of the aspirants who have other exams & schedules planned .

        QUIZZING                           One of my biggest passions is Quizzing. I have been a very active Quizzer right from my Schooling days and have been part of Quiz Organizations & online Quiz Groups. Yesterday I got the Wonderful oppurtunity to Host a Quiz at my office on the Topic "Social Awareness & Drive Safety Awareness". Yeah it was Quiz with a Difference . Under the Aegis of Social Services Committee , I conducted a Quiz on Social Workers , NGO's , Community awareness etc. I will post the Questions shortly on this site.                            At the end of the day it was an immensely satisfying experience to have conducted a Quiz which I hope spurred people to make a Difference to the Society.

        PUNCTUALITY                             Punctuality sadly is a Virtue much preached than Practiced here in India . We pride ourselves in saying IST stands for Indian Stretchable Time . Punctuality is perhaps the first virtue which creates an impression in stranger's mind when you meet them.                           At my work place we have a Daily meeting to review any problems/issues during the day. The meeting starts at 8pm Sharp and anyone entering after 8pm (even at 8:01 pm) has to pay a fine of Rs.50 . This has instilled a wonderful sense of time consciousness in most of us who attend that meeting . Punctuality is to a larger extent the Reflection of one's Self-Discipline & integrity . I am glad I picked this wonderful habit !!

        DELHI & MADRAS                                  I have never been a fan of the Climate of Madras. But during my visit last week , I was really glad to be amidst the warm sultry weather of madras which was a great contrast to the Gloomy Cold Delhi . They say things are relative in life. One never appreciates things until he has seen the worst or the other side of the coin.                                 Madras is at its best in Nov/Dec/Jan . The Weather is wonderful & the air vibrates of Music & religion culminating in the Carnatic music season & maargazhi utsavams & Bhajans. Tourists flock the city for the music concerts which creates a Vibrant ambience that is Intellectually & culturally stimulating. The choice of Artistes & concerts during the season is mind-boggling. Oh gosh..I really miss being in Chennai.

        VIOLINIST                           I remember this Good old Joke "What is the Difference between Gandhiji & Lalgudi Jayaraman ? " & the answer is "One is a Non-Violinist & other is a Violinist ".  Probably a PJ . When I visited Madras this time I got my Good old Violin repaired with the intention of starting Carnatic Violin Classes here at Delhi. Its been a big regret for me not continuing Carnatic music classes and Hope I continue it here in Delhi.                                   On a Humorous Note , Sudha Raghunathan was in the Airport lounge the same time as I was waiting for my flight. I was having my Violin strapped across like a Backpack and all the passengers gave me admiring looks thinking I was accompanying Sudha on Violin for some future Concert. Little did they realise that I was just an amateur on my way to learn Violin !!

        PUSHKAR -- AJMER -- JAIPUR                                      Pushkar is one of the Holiest Cities in India and the Annual Camel Fair there attracts close to 5,00,000 tourists every year including the 40,000 foreign tourists . The fair this year was from 5-8 November . My Uncle & Aunt were in Jaipur this weekend which prompted me to plan a Trip out there .                                     We set out for Pushkar early on the saturday morning . Pushkar lies 400 Kms from Delhi ( Delhi - Jaipur = 250 + Jaipur - Pushkar = 150 ) . The Delhi Jaipur is a part of the Golden Quadrilateral with wonderful Toll roads lined with Greenery. The crowd was an enthusaistic lot and the time flew as we drove towards Pushkar. As we reached Pushkar the Traffic grew and roads became immensely crowded and we finally reached the city after an exhausting 7 hour Drive.      PUSHKAR :  Its a rather dusty quaint town with nothing much to boast of other than the Famed Brahma Temple and the International camel fair. We had to walk almost 4 kms from the parking lot to the city . The roads were extremely crowded & dusty but the festive mood kept the air ringing. After a long walk we reached the fair Grounds. Most of the camels had been sold out by the time we reached there ( Since it was the last day ) but we still managed a glimpse of close to 500 camels and horses. The camel ride was exhilirating ( the Takeoff & landing of a camel is a adventure unto itself !!) and we spent the next few hours wandering through the fair. The camel is a fascinating Animal which as adapted itself wonderfully to the Dry Desert Conditions ( It can stay waterless for days , has a very dry skin & foot adapted to wade through the sand & thick eye brows to shield the eyes from Sand etc ..) . The average price of a camel ranges anywhere between Rs.2000 - 30000 ( Depending on the age , both factors being inversely proportional ) .                                 We next visited the Brahma temple. It is apparently the only temple for Lord Brahma in the world , though there is nothing much spectacular about it. We then had a holy dip at the Pushkar Lake which had some illumanted lights with the back drop of a wonderful sunset .    AJMER :  we then headed to Ajmer which is 12 kms from Pushkar towards Jaipur. Ajmer is famous for the Dargah of Moin-ud-din Chisti , a 12th Century Sufi saint. Its one of the Holiest places for Muslims. We visited the Dargah which had a stunning ornate entrance although the supposed to be Holy place unfortunately is more of a money laundering machine these days ( A sad thing which I had noticed in Vrindavan too ) .    JAIPUR :  We left for Jaipur early sunday morning. Our Driver would put to test Schumi's winning record had he competed in F1 !! The city palace is beautiful in parts and has some good collection of fabrics & weaponery. There are plenty of the famous Madhubani paintings of Rajasthan there . We then Went to Jantar mantar which is just beside the palace. Jantar Mantar was built by sawai Jai Singh in the 18th Century and uses huge Geometrical figures to Calculate the Time & other astronomial phenomena. Its a dream place for astronomers and it calculates time with an amazing accuracy for a place so old. we then saw the Hawa Mahal (Palace of winds) . The view from hawa Mahal is quite spectacular & the front facade of the monument offers some great photographic moments . We then met up with my uncle & aunt and had some good food at Dasaprakash. We then visited the Amber palace & fort located 11 kms from Jaipur on the jaipur - Delhi Highway . Its a beautiful palace and the sheesh mahal has some intricate carvings & glasswork which leaves one spellbound. The view from the top is very good too . We then headed back to Delhi and ended a very memorable trip.     TRAVEL ADVICE  : The best time to make the trip is when the camel fair is on. The camel fair dates get fixed based on the Lunar calendar and the full moon day. Nov-Dec is the best time to travel since Rajasthan is very hot otherwise. People with Dust Allergy should bring plenty of medication . Come with loads of Cash if you want to buy a Camel or Horse !!

        French Connection                                      I have been wanting to learn a new language for quite sometime. But as usual my laziness has resulted in procrastination more often than not. Thanks to my friend Venkat , I finally pulled up my socks and both of us enrolled in French classes leading to CFE at Alliance Francaise today.                                     I have always admired the richness of the french language ( Though the language I would have loved to learn is Urdu !!) and am glad that finally I am making some progress towards it.

        KASAULI                      My Uncle & Aunt have come down from Mumbai to Delhi and we went to Chandigarh & Kasauli this weekend. Since I have already written about Kurukshetra & Chandigarh earlier , I will not cover much about them. But every time I visit Chandigarh it seems to me the most beautiful city in India .                                      Kasauli is a quaint little town located 50 Kms from Chandigarh on the Chandigarh - Shimla Highway . Its a small town with pristine beauty far away from the madding crowd. We stayed at the HPTDC Hotel called Roscommon . It just takes a little more than 3 hours by walk to cover the entire town of Kasauli ( 5-6 kms) . According to Legend , when Hanuman was carrying the Sanjeevani hill from Himalayas to Lanka his foot touched a mountain peak here in Kasauli. There is a Hanuman temple built there ( ooff , its a steep climb !!) . The Mall road is littered with a few shops and offers some wonderful views of the monutains. Life is very quiet & peaceful in this litle town far away from the chaos of Delhi. The Kalka Mail at 23:45 is a good train by which one can return to Delhi early morning.                                      Kasauli is an ideal place for travellers who want to avoid the crowded Hill stations like Shimla or Mussorie.

        SEMMANGUDI                                It was with great sadness that I read about the Death of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer , the Doyen of Carnatic music. One of the outstanding vocalists of the 20th Century he was like a pitmaah to most of the upcoming carnatic music artistes . His rendition of Karaharapriya & subhapantuvarali ragas still remain etched in my memory . May his soul rest in peace.

        Peter Principle                               A few weeks back I was having a discussion with a friend of mine about Work profile in US & India. In US we have colleagues who have been working as Tech Support guys for 25 years , pretty much doing the same thing over the years . Most of them do not want to get promoted and like what they are doing.                                       Whereas in India once someone has more than 6 + years of experience in IT he either becomes a Team Lead or PM . Now where is the justification that a good techie will make a Good Manager . Because in most cases these guys hardly know the nuances of Management and end up getting disparaged for no fault of theirs ( Most of them never asked for a manager promotion and would have been happy being a Techie ) . We rarely see people who still write Code at the age of 40 in India .                                                             Reminds me of Peter Priniciple " In a hierarchy every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence " Here is a concise  urlLink article  on it.

        Thayir Chadam ( Curd Rice)                                              Read this  urlLink article  in rediff and it struck a chord inside me. I feel as if I have written this article because it exactly conveys my feelings. Having been ( & still) a big Curd Rice fan , I identify myself with this article.                                                         In fact my mom tells me a story when I was 10 years old , they had taken me to a party in Taj and I had insisted on having only Curd Rice even there !! Curd Rice still is my favourite dish and will remain so forever .

        Picasso - The Confidence of Genius                                Desmond Morris tells this amazing Picasso Story. Morris Writes " My favourite Picasso story concerns the time he went back to look at an old studio of his in Paris , and there , lying on a bench outside the gate , was an old tramp. Picasso recognized the man and asked what had happened to him.The old boy explained that he had fallen on hard times and now had nowhere to live. Picasso went over to a nearby rubbish-bin , pulled out a large piece of cardboard , did a quick drawing on it , signed it , and gave it to the tramp, saying : 'Here, buy yourself a house.'

        Marlon Brando & Eccentricity                            Just finished reading a book called Naked eye by Desmond Morris. Naked Eye is an interesting study in Human Behaviour. Found this piece interesting. Morris writes about his strange meeting with Brando. The eccentricities of Marlon Brando are Legendary. Arguably one of the Greatest Actors of 20th Century , he has had more than his share of Controversies.                                                                                 Desmond Morris here writes about one of the eccentricities of Brando "Brando says he has no sense of time. Time means nothing to him. Once , he told me , he was buying drinks at a liquor store and had to pay by cheque. He did not know the date , so he said to the man behind the counter : 'It's the 12th? ''No," replied the man, 'it's the 5th'. 'Ah' , said Brando , 'the 5th April , thank you' .'No,''replied the man , 'the 5th of March.''Could you check the price of that bottle up there on the top shelf?'asked Brando . While the man climbed the ladder , Brando was able to sneak a look at the newspaper , lying on the counter , to find out what year it was.

        FOGGY DELHI                            I am getting used to the Cold of Delhi . Feel like a Iceman inside an Igloo wearing three layers of Clothing & Socks inside the apartment even while asleep . Its very difficult to get up early in the morning and the whole biological clock is going for a toss . The Outside Temperature at daytime is 12 c compounded by occasional drizzles & chilly winds. The night time temperature has dropped to 5c . Its been a few weeks since I have seen Sun's rays and now I understand why the westerners get excited on seeing the Sun.

        Interview with Herb Kelleher                                             Here is an  urlLink Interview  in the Businessweek of Herb Kelleher , the former maverick CEO of Southwest Airlines. Southwest Airlines is an amazing company which revolutionized low cost flying in the US and has been profitable ever since 1973 amidst tumultuous years for the Airline Industry. Its business model has been one of most copied and its crazy tactics have kept the Airlines always in the spotlight.                                                         Incidentally I am reading a book now called NUTS ! , which is about the way Southwest Airlines is Run .

        INDIA & WESTERNISATION                                          Found these interesting quotes by two of India's leading global ambassadors.  " With all my love for India and with all my patriotism and veneration for the ancients, I cannot but think that we have to learn many things from other nations…. We cannot do without the world outside India; it was our foolishness that we thought we could, and we have paid the penalty by about thousand years of slavery. That we did not go out to compare things with other nations did not mark the workings that have been all around us, has been one of the great causes of this degradation of the Indian mind. We have paid the penalty, let us do it no more." -- Swami Vivekananda  "I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the cultures of all the lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any." -- Mahatma Gandhi

        Carnatic Music                                          The Carnatic music festival must be in full swing at Madras now. I miss all that action here and has to be satisfied with just CD's & cassettes. My father has been the biggest influence in me taking an active interest in Carnatic music. I remember when I was 10 years old we had this Raga Identification cassette series and my dad would identify Ragas in a matter of seconds and I would be left wondering how the heck is that possible ? He has been listening to the December season concerts for more than 30 years now and has an amazing knowledge on that subject.                                I never pursued carnatic music completely although the interest hasn't waned over the years.Whatever I know is mostly from Cassettes & CD's and also I never miss an occasion if there is a live concert around where I live. Hopefully I will start off my Violin lessons from new year & do well .

        TOI Vs HT - Farcical Game                                   Today's reports published by TOI (Times of India)  & HT (Hindustan Times) Claiming themselves as No.1 in Delhi presents the most ludicruous battle in recent times. TOI  urlLink claims  to be No.1 from the NRS Survey while HT  urlLink Claims  to be the No.1 according to ABC (Audit Bureau of Circulation ) survey in which TOI hasn't participated.                                            It was disgusting to read the Chest thumping in TOI which claims itself as the Newspaper of the elite & Intelligent (when its actually not ) and their self-gloating.. I don't read the HT much to comment on it . Its unfortunate that such cheap journalism has become a common occurence in these days when India is emerging as the World's knowledge economy.

        FASCINATION                              These days I am writing a lot of Essays for B-schools. The oft repeated question in these essays is "What are your hobbies & interests ?" . The answer I would have loved to give them is Everything interests me .                                    I remember reading a Book called Ã„ndromeda Strain" by Micheal Crichton a few years back. The protagonist in this novel is a Nobel Prize winning Scientist named Jeremy Stone. I simply liked the way Jeremy Stone was introduced by Crichton . Crichton says "Jeremy knows everything and is fascinated by the rest ". I thought that one line said it all.

        LOVE STORY - ERICH SEGAL                                                      Was doing a Quiz today on first lines of famous Books,when I recollected this incident.                                       A few years ago when I was in the US , I had gone to meet my cousin in Salt Lake city. I was very tired after driving all the way from San Jose, California to Salt lake city , Utah. I asked her if she had anything light to read before I dozed off to sleep. Her Roomie gave me the book Love Story. But when I started reading it , I was hooked. The first lines of the Book just caught me by the scruff and I went to sleep only in the early hours of the morning after completing the book in one sitting.                                       Its a wonderful love story powered by the excellent narrative style of Erich Segal with some memorable dialogues first person narrative brought a whole new meaning & understanding to the book and will stand etched in my memory for years to come.One's understanding of love & life is likely to undergo a definite transformation once one has finished reading this book.No other book makes you Laugh & Cry at the same time and it leaves you with a multitude of emotions at the end.Oliver & Jenny will remain immortal forever as the Ultimate fictional lovers.                     Here are the  starting lines of that Book :    What can you say about a 25 year old girl who died?  That she was beautiful and brilliant.  That she loved Mozart and Bach.  And the Beatles.  And me.  Once, when she specifically lumped me with those musical types, I asked her what the order was, and she replied,  smiling, "Alphabetical."  At the time I smiled too.  But now I sit and wonder whether she was listing me by my first name-in which case I would trail Mozart-or by my last name, in which case I would edge in there between Bach and the Beatles.  Either way I don't come first, which for some stupid reason bothers the hell out of me.

        PLAGIARISM                            On the FM Today , a latest hindi song caught my attention. It was from the movie Aitbaar . The tune was a complete copy of a Nusral Fateh Ali Khan Qawwali I had listened to a few years back. The most surprising thing was that  they had even copied some of the lyrics too. But this isn't surprising for Bollywood which in the last 20 years has thrived on Plagiarism of all kinds. Here is a wondeful  urlLink site  on Plagirism in Bollywood & Tamil Filmworld. This guy has an amazing repository of the original versus the copied ones (audio files) and you can listen to them and find out how many of the popular songs of recent years have actually been inspired (isn't that the term music directors use ?) .

        RAHUL DRAVID                               Cricket is a Religion in India . Its one of those few things which binds the nation together. India's spectacular win against Australia today has been made possible by one Man . They call him the "Great Wall of India ". He says "I don't have the Super Talent of Sachin or the flurry of strokes like Laxman ". That is Dravid for you . The ever modest Mr.Dependable . Life is not just about Talent. Its perseverance and Hard-work which can bridge the gap between Success & talent. Dravid has been the most consistent scorer for India in the last two years . Earlier he had the habit of getting into a shell which he has over come thankfully these days. A wonderful thinker of the game , I salute him for his consistency & hard-work. He deserves all the praise which is being reaped on him.                                       As Thomas Alva Edison said "Genius is 1% inspiration & 99% perspiration ".

On reaching England his equipment full of wires, batteries ,dials and condensor were destroyed by the customs officials as they feared that it was some offensive weapon.He spent his next couple of months assembling his equipment from scratch.He once said "My chief trouble was that the idea was so elementary, so simple in logic, that it seemed difficult to believe no one else had thought of putting it into practice. The idea was so real to me that I did not realize that to others the theory might appear quite fantastic".

Seems the Demand for pugs ( The breed of Dog that appears in the commercial) has increased steeply ever since the Ad. Exams,bathroom,Soccer the pug follows him everywhere !! .... Great Concept,nicely conceived , wonderful music . The pug which acted belongs to a Farmhouse in Goa and seems the cute kid is from Bangalore.                                             I have the highest respect for O&M and Mccann-Erickson when it comes to creative advertising.

        MAGNANIMITY                               This is Continuation of my earlier post. I had gone to a Slum to distribute clothes to the kids. I stepped out of the car & found this 7 year old girl who was looking at me with curiosity. I took out a frock to give to her but realised it was too small for her. She cutely went inside the Hut and brought a 3 year old to whom the frock was an exact fit. I asked her what her name was & she said Gori. Gori was not even expecting another piece of frock from me nor was she sad that the earlier frock didn't fit her. I was moved by her Magnanimity ( Beacuse a few minutes earlier at another place people were litreally plucking from our hands clothes of all sizes irrespective of whether it fits them or not) . I offered her a bigger frock and she became so happy that she put it on immediately and started Dancing . I have taken a nice photo of it and the sheer joy on her face was unparalleled. I learnt a valuable lesson : Great people not necessarily need to be rich or educated or aged.

We had undertaken an old clothes Drive , through which we collected close to 400 Clothes from all our employees . I had gone today to distribute those clothes to a Slum near DND Flyover & Ramakrishna Mission . At the DND Flyover we distributed close to 100 Sweaters to the kids most of whom were bare-bodied with hardly any clothes on them .  It was a very satisfying & productive day and I was glad that I could help in a small way in making a difference to these people's lives.

        TIME MANAGEMENT                                         I do not know if i am good at Time management but all I know is I am very poor at prioritising. Also in most cases I don't know how to say no and end up taking too many responsibilities and over-working myself. Suddenly over the last few days I have been busy as hell . I have taken a few additional responsibilities at my workplace and have been fighting hard to find time to balance everything. Its good in a way that my time gets utilized properly (with little idle time) & my productivity increases. But then I have a feeling that Life is leading me rather than I leading my life.                                         I remember John Lennon's (Beatles) famous quote " Life is what Happens to you when you are busy making other plans".

        TEDDY                       Today is the Birthday of my Dog - Teddy . She has been with us for the last eight years & is an integral part of our family. Although I have been away from my family the last six years , I still adore her & she still Considers me to be her absolute master.                                         It was in the first week of Jan'96 when my uncle asked if we wanted a German Shepherd pup since his boss's dog had just given birth to six pups. I had always been a big lover of pets , but it was my brother who made a strong pitch and the next day we found this cute little pup amidst us. I didn't know what to name it , but it looked so cute and resembled a Teddy Bear straight out of the Shop with Black Coat & brown legs that I decided to name her Teddy . The initial months were difficult but she adapted quickly to her surroundings and has ever since been a Loyal & disciplined dog. She still fusses over food a lot & craves attention much the same way we humans do.                                        In 1997 she gave birth to seven cute looking pups and I can never forget the next two months when my entire household turned into a circus with eight dogs roaming all around.                                        But to have a Dog is an ultimate pleasure in life. I have never known what  unconditional love is until having a dog of my own. Its an immensly satisfying experience playing with her or talking her for a walk . I have terribly missed her over the last few years  and always feel elated when I have to visit Madras.                                        One piece of Trivia : The entire Tamil nadu celebrates her birthday because afterall its Rajinikanth's Birthday too !!!!

It would be a 1700 Crore Assembly Plant. Its a big Victory for Naidu who has managed to usurp this project from traditional Auto favourable states Like Maharashtra & Tamil Nadu .

        ANBE SIVAM ( LOVE IS GOD)                                                      Saw the Tamil Movie Anbe Sivam this weekend (*ing Kamalhassan & Madhavan) . It was a very good movie portraying the verbal duels between a Communist & a Capitalist . The dialogues were Razor sharp ( Thanks to Madan of Anandha Vikatan) & the movie ends by saying  "Goodliness is Godliness". The title isn't surprising Considering that Kamal himself is a self-confessed agnostic. As always , the movie was not a big success at the box office , I later learnt.

        DELHI ZOO                            Visited the Delhi Zoo this weekend. Its a fairly big one with lots of Animals although the maintanance leaves a lot to be desired. I was lucky to spot two playful Leopard cubs having a whale of a time playing with each other and got a few good snaps of their merriment.  Also since it was Winter we saw ample water Birds like Cormorants,egrets,herons,storks &  pelicans.                                      The attitude of people was shocking . Couple of guys standing next to me were throwing stones at a Lion and people were also seen teasing the monkeys & the Tiger. I had to shout on a Group to stop throwing stones & I really felt sorry for those wonderful animals to be amidst such cruel Humans .

        A TALE OF TOO MANY CITIES - MUMBAI                                                The second in a Series of articles on Cities where I have lived (first one was on Madras) .I lived in Mumbai for two years . First one Year at Andheri and later one year at Ghatkopar.     LIKES :  I just Adore Mumbai. Its a city brimming with life & vitality and definitely one of my most favourite city . Its a Great city for working people with a professional Outlook and people in General are very nice & friendly in Mumbai. I love the Crowds & the Trains of mumbai . The trains are the lifeline & I used to wander all across Mumbai from Borivali to Andheri to Dadar to Chembur to Thane in those crowded trains. South Mumbai is spectacular with its beautiful seaface & Marine Drive. The Food in Mumbai is Great . From the Vadapaavs/ Bhelpuris / Paani Puris / Lassis to Magical South Indian joints in Matunga & Chembur , mumbai has it all. Whenever I see the ad of Citibank saying "The Citi Never Sleeps", I think of Mumbai.Great Infrastructure with 24 Hr Power Supply , No water/Road problem & perhaps the best public transport I have ever seen in the world.    DISLIKES :  Cost of Living , Exploding population , Big gap between Rich & poor .    PLACES TO SEE :  Gateway of India , Juhu & Chowpatty beaches , Mahalaxmi & Siddhivinayak temples , Queen's Necklace  , Elephanta Caves , Sanjay Gandhi National park ,  Crawford market , Powai lake.    Strengths :  Financial Capital of India , Gateway to the West , Home of Big Business houses , Professional Work Culture , Great Transport system , Wonderful amenities (power,water) management , Cosmopolitan Population , Natural Harbour , Biggest inflow & outflow of International Traffic , Entertainment Capital of India (Bollywood!!) .    Weaknesses :  High Real estate costs , Exploding population , More of an old-age than a new age city , Traffic Jam nightmares.    Oppurtunities :  Areas of Banking & Finance , Financial Outsourcing ( Investment Banking Analysis & research) by Wall street firms like Merrill Lynch , Lehmann Bros , Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan etc , Entertainment (Globalisation of Bollywood ) , Healthcare , Retail Trade , IT/ITES ( Has a few big names like Accenture, EDS but got to promote its English speaking population more) .     Threats :  Mafia & underworld , Poor State govt support & performance (The earlier Mumbai detaches itself from Maharashtra the better it is for the city ) , Need for quicker management of Roadways ( Flyovers to grapple traffic mess), New age Cities like Hyd,Blore attract chunk of FDI , High cost of Living.                                             Mckinsey & co has submitted a 32 page Report for Turning around Mumbai . If the Govt doesn't want Mumbai to become a Dead city I guess they need to take most things in that report seriously.  Bombay is Bombay anyday its the face of India.

        SAFFRON SWEEP IN HINDI HEARTLAND                                                       The Election results came as a bit of surprise with BJP Capturing power in three states from the Congress. While the Victory in M.P was expected , the margin was huge than predicted by any opinion polls. The Rajasthan win was a big surprise because Gehlot's Govt wasn't that unpopular ( To give them Credit , both Gehlot & Digvijay had done a Decent job during their stint ) . Delhi gave a Thumping Majority to Sheila Dikshit for all the Good work she has done in the last few years. Chattisgarh was embroiled in controversies from day one and turned out to be a surprise for BJP.                                  One good thing about this election was it was fought on a Development Platform ( Bijli , Sadak , Paani) rather than the Hindutva plank which shows a remarkable maturity .

        More Jokes from Jay Leno Show    1. President Bush hosted NASCAR drivers at the White House yesterday. Bush is a huge NASCAR fan. Well, NASCAR is a lot like Iraq – you begin really fast, go around and around in circles and end up the same place you started.  2. Oil prices are now at their highest levels in 20 years, so today Exxon declared the war in Iraq a complete success.   3. The New York Times reported this week that Michael Jackson is $200 million in debt and his financial advisers have ordered him to cut back on spending. Let me tell you something, if you’re $200 million in debt, the first thing you do is fire the financial advisers!   4. The president’s staff told him nobody would suspect that he’d fly off to Iraq. And Bush said, "Well, sure, since it’s Thanksgiving everybody will think I’m going to Turkey."   5. He gave quite a stirring speech to the troops in Baghdad, saying "We will stay until the job is done." He then hopped on a plane and flew back to Texas.

        INDIA - The Next Superpower ?                                          Suddenly the nation is filled with an overwhelming optimism. The Stock markets are at a all time High, Business are doing extremely well (Both Old & new economy) , The rainfall has been good this monsoon , Service sector jobs have seen a tremendous growth . So are we now what Japan was in the 60's & 70's ( On the Threshold of Superstardom) ? Here is a Quick analysis by me :   1. IT , ITES , BPO : There never has been a greater time to be in this sector. Every MNC wants to outsource to India and the Indian talent is being glossed over by the Western Media & MNC's. In spite of the nascent backlash in the US , things look quite upbeat . The best thing about IT jobs is that the quality of work is amazing in India these days ( TI,Intel,Oracle, Motorola ) .    2. Pharma : The Indian Giants are spreading their wings Globally . Ranbaxy,Dr.Reddy , Sun Pharma , CIPLA , Wockhardt all are fighting for a share in the Global markets & competing with low cost drugs . Even on the R&D front we aren't far behind. More than 50% of revenues are from Global sales.   3. Automobile & Manufacturing : City Rover is Tata Indica. M&M tractor sales in the US are impressive. TVS Group is the only second non Japanese company to win coveted Deming prize twice. Moser bear makes optical discs which are used by 11 of 12 big manufacturers. GM,Ford,Chrysler are looking at outsourcing parts worth $1.5 Billion from India .   4. Textiles : Arvind Mills and other Denim successes and Reliance in Polyester & yarn.                                              The list goes on & on & on(Oil , Cement , Entertainment) ............ So can we make it ? What are the Hurdles curtailing India ? More on it later.

        MIGRATION OF BIRDS                                            One of the most fascinating study is about the Migration of Birds. Science is yet to find a Definitive answer as to how Birds find their Direction when flying such a Long Distance. The siberian Crane flies from Russia to India and the mightiest of them is the Arctic Tern which flies from Arctic to Antarctic and back every year . Amazing !!                                        The Book "Trials of life " gives some interesting inputs on this phenomenon. The scientists for a long time thought its the position of Sun & stars which provides them the Direction. But experiments on a Cloudy day or with Opaque glasses fitted to Birds have proved that most of them still found their way back !! . The other explanation is that the earth's magnetic field acts as a Guidance to the Birds ( A fact corroborated by traces of magnetic material in Birds and also when magnets strong enough to deflect earth's magnetic field were placed in the Birds they lost their way ) . So now scientists beleive its a Combination of the Magneto-astrnomical forces which help the Bird in its trajectory.                                               Its amazing the way these birds find Direction so easily travelling thousand of miles where we Human beings have to look for Driving Directions to places where we have been so many times !!

        KHNH & DHOOL                                I saw two movies this Sunday Kal Ho naa Ho (*ing Shah Rukh , Saif , Preity Zinta) & a tamil Movie Dhool (*ing Vikram , Jyotika) . Kal Ho Naa Ho was a typical Karan Johar movie ( Though he didn't direct it) with foreign locales, kitsch dresses , Good songs & loads of Sentiment. It reminds you of Anand ( Though its nowhere close to the Classic ) . The appreciable aspect of the movie is the underlying humor throughout the movie. The movie inspite of all its weaknesses is worth a one-time watch.                               Dhool was a typical tamil masala movie. Its breezed past very fast with some songs, action by Vikram. it was very tautly directed and having seen very few tamil movies in the last few years , it was a refreshing change for me.

        DELHI METRO                             I travelled in the Delhi Metro Rail on Sunday & been very impressed. It boasts of State of Art Infrastructure (Trains, Stations,Parking ) and gives you a feeling of almost being abroad. Delhi Metro looks very similar to the BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) in San Francisco , which I used to commute a few years earlier. The Doors are automatic and the announcements are very well made and if the entire project is completed , it would be a great Boon for the city of Delhi and its suburbs.

        World MBA Fair                              The World MBA fair was held on Saturday in Taj Mahal Hotel , Delhi. Some of the best B-schools like Yale , Tuck , Stern, U-Mich , U-Chicago, USC, NUS, INSEAD, Melbourne Business School had participated in the fair. I was fortunate enough to attend a lecture by a Gentleman who was an Alumni of Wharton. He discussed about the scope & career oppurtunities of MBA , Avg salraries , emerging trends / markets , Application & selection process of a B-school . His lecture was excellent and very enlightening.

        Martyrs Day - Gandhiji                          Today is the martyrs day - the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. A man who stands as the epitome of Honesty & simplicity . He is definitely the most famous Global Indian and inspiration to millions of people worldwide for his policy of non-violence. He is also the most misunderstood soul inside India , where half-baked historians & politicians have blamed him for the Partition of India . In fact most of the youth of today have grown on this diet of misinformation . I remember reading his Autobiography "My experiements with Truth"a few years back. Its a great book because its a candid & brutal confessions of all his mistakes and it takes a great soul to accept one's shortcomings. Also my views on Gandhi very considerably influenced when I read "Freedom at Night by Lapierre & Collins".                          His message that India lives in its villages is the basis for Kalam's Vision 2020 and the Country realizes that Rural India means a lot to the nation as we strive to become the next superpower. My thoughts go to what Albert Einstein said about Gandhiji  "Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as [Gandhi] ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth."

        La Vita e Bella (Life is Beautiful)                                                      Watched the amazing movie "Life is Beautiful" today . A wonderful tale of Romance,Humor & Nazi Concentration camps. The first half is refreshing with humor and attempts by Roberto Benigni to woo his girlfriend. Humor forms a part of the second half too against a grim backdrop of Nazi Concentration camp. Benigni's charm,optimism and his vow to protect the soul of his son pervade throughout the movie. The Background music score wonderfully complements the stunning Roman visuals. The movie is a stark contrast to most of the Jewish Holocaust movies since it uses Humor & Optimism to portray a poignant tale. Its tough to decide whether Roberto Benigni outshines as an Actor or Director (Although he got an Oscar for Best Actor , I would say the directorial touch was excellent) . The Kid is cute and Nicoletta looks ravishing.                                                           I saw this movie a few years back in Italian with English subtitles.However today thankfully saw the dubbed version which made me understand a few nuances which I had missed earlier. Would highly recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it . Please do see & realize what good Cinema is all about.

        Smile on Billion faces                                           Its a momentous time for India . The economy is prospering , Companies are going Global , Service sector is expanding & as BJP claims "India is Shining" . However the modern youth are still wary of politicians . One Man has towered above all this and has become a role model for millions of youth . There have reportedly been fan associations for him , the first of its kind. The son of a poor fisherman he has risen to become a Scientist,Educationist and now the President of India - A.P.J.Abdul Kalam. A man of utmost simplicity & modesty , his speeches I would say are the most circulated emails among the net-savvy Indian population. His vision 2020 aims to catapult India amongst the Global superpowers. Here is a wonderful  urlLink speech  by him on the eve of our Republic Day (2004) .

        Perseverance                               Just finished reading the 3rd Edition of "Chicken Soup for the Soul" . Found some really good inspiring stories in there . Here is one on Thomas Alva Edison :   On the night of December 9, 1914, the great Thomas Alva Edison Industries of West Orange, New Jersey, is destroyed by fire. Thomas Edison loses $2,000,000 that night and much of his life's work goes up in flames. He is insured, but only for $230,000 because the buildings has been made of concrete and at that time it is thought to be fire-proof.   Edison's son, who was twenty-four at the time, finds his sixty-seven year old father that night standing near the fire, his face ruddy in the glow, his white hair blown by the December winds. "My heart ached for him," remembered Charles Edison. "He was no longer a young man-and everything was going up in flames." But the next morning in the silence of the charred remains, while poking through the embers of his hopes and dreams, Thomas Edison says to his wife and son: "There is great value in disaster. All our mistakes are burned up. Thank God we can start anew."                  Three short weeks after the fire, Thomas Alva Edison delivers to the world the first phonograph.

        Punjabi Wedding                                                       Yesterday I happened to attend a marriage of my Dad's friend's daughter . My dad's friend is a Sardarji & this was the first time I was attending a Sikh Wedding. The remarkable aspect is that the wedding was just a 3 Hours affair (When compared to the Tam - Bram weddings which are 2.5 Days !!) . There was the Baraat followed by Reception for 30 minutes and then the Anand Karaj (Traditional wedding) where they go around the Guru Granth Sahib  .                                  The Lunch was delicious with upto 100 varieties of everything from fast food , fruits, Roti , Side Dishes , Rice , Sweets , Ice Creams , Juices etc. The Fried Ice-Cream in particular was delicious. They take the ice-cream & dip it in Cream and then roll it over powdered coconut and then fry it in Oil for 3 seconds . So the final product is fried lightly outside & cold inside . First time ever in my life saw Ice-cream being fried !!!

        Rewarding Mediocrity                                          Happened to watch a bit of the Screen-Star Cine Awards the other day . The Best film award for 2003 went to Koi Mil Gaya . When we continue to patronize such mediocre films , why do we then expect to compete with the Global cinema ?                                              There is nothing wrong with commercial Cinema . But Steven Spielberg never got an Oscar for his commercial ventures like Jaws or E.T , he got an Oscar only for his classic "Schindler's List " . I fail to understand why the Jury fails to differentiate between commercial success & meaningful cinema . A 1000 Crore investment Industry , Bollywood ought to churn out more Quality for the money invested.

        e-choupal                         I guess it was Francis Bacon who said "Knowledge is Power" . The sentence is immensely true in the knowledge economy these days where companies compete on intellectual horsepower. The Indian victory call of the 60's ( Jai Jawan , Jai Kisaan ) is becoming increasingly relevant , as Indian Agriculture strives to match up with the Services Sector. Nothing much seemed to have happened after the Green revolution and uneven monsoons & increasing urbanisation has only added to India's agricultural woes.                                           ITC has pioneered the Community initiative e-choupal ( Choupal in Hindi is a gathering place ) . e-choupal makes global agricultural information available to the farmers at Kiosks ( the eqvt of a cybercafe ) at free of cost and this information empowers them and also kiosks help them in knowing about the weather , monsoons and other natural phenomena. They have already covered 11,000 villages & 1,00,000 farmers. As Gandhiji said India lives in its villages and it will be initiatives like this aimed at the rural markets which will wipe out our Poverty and not Glitzy shopping malls & discotheques.

        Inspiring Stories - The Miracle Bridge                                                                The Brooklyn Bridge that spans the river between Manhattan and Brooklyn is simply an engineering miracle. In 1883, a creative engineer, John Roebling, was inspired by an idea for this spectacular bridge project. However, bridge-building experts told him to forget it, it just was not possible. Roebling convinced his son, Washington, an up-and-coming engineer, that the bridge could be built. The two of them conceived the concept of how it could be accomplished, and how to overcome the obstacles. Somehow they convinced bankers to finance the project. Now with unharnessed excitement and energy, they hired their crew and began to build their dream bridge.  The project was only a few months under way when a tragic on-site accident killed John Roebling and severely injured his son. Washington was severely brain-damaged, unable to talk or walk. Everyone thought that the project would have been scrapped since the Roeblings were the only ones who understood how the bridge could be built.  Though Washington Roebling was unable to move or talk, his mind was as sharp as ever. One day, as he lay in his hospital bed, an idea flashed in his mind as to how to develop a communication code. All he could move was one finger, so he touched the arm of his wife with that finger. He tapped out the code to communicate to her what she was to tell the engineers who continued building the bridge. For 13 years, Washington tapped out his instructions with one finger until the spectacular Brooklyn Bridge was finally completed.

        Inspiring Stories - Good news               Robert De Vincenzo, the great Argentine golfer, once won a tournament and, after receiving the check and smiling for the cameras, he went to the clubhouse and  prepared to leave. Some time later, he walked alone to his car in the parking lot and  was approached by a young woman. She congratulated him on his victory and then told him that her child was seriously ill and near death. She did not know how she could pay the doctor’s bills and hospital expenses.             De Vincenzo was touched by her story, and he took out a pen and endorsed his winning check for payment to the woman. "Make some good days for the baby," he said as he pressed the check into her hand. The next week he was having lunch in a country club when a Professional Golf Association official came to his table. "Some of the boys in the parking lot last week told me you met a young woman there after you won that tournament." De Vincenzo  nodded. "Well," said the official, "I have news for you. She’s a phony. She has no sick baby. She’s not even married. She fleeced you, my friend."        "You mean there is no baby who is dying?" said De Vincenzo.        "That’s right," said the official.        "That’s the best news I’ve heard all week." De Vincenzo said.

        ATTITUDE                          If there is a singular trait which can make/break an individual , it would be his/her attitude . Every Human being has his/her fallibility. Be it Lack of Confidence , Low Self-esteem , Negative Thoughts , Arrogance , Vanity , Dishonesty, laziness everything is reflected in your attitude .                                     I had a chance to attend a Training on Attitude today . I will not say that it has changed my life but definitely implanted a few thoughts worth pursuing . I will try to write/link more posts based on Self-development & inspirational thoughts/stories. Most of us are hypocrites. Either we don't admit our fallibility or dismiss heart-felt thoughts as being too emotional & maudlin .  The greatest leader is one who learns from his mistakes and from others . Let us see if I can manage to implement what I learnt. I would be a happy man even If I live upto 50 % of my idealistic thoughts . As Gandhiji said "you must be the change you wish to see in the world " .

        CEOs Are Ridiculed for Huge Salaries: Why Aren't Athletes and Entertainers?                                    A very innocuous question but quite pertinent in these days of Corporate Scandals . This is a question for which even I have been seeking an answer for a long time. Take Bollywood for example , The Salaries our stars commend would make people wonder if its the same mumbai which houses the biggest slum in Asia .

        In Love with Mumbai Trains                                      Was seeing this colorful  urlLink pictures  of Mumbai trains when I fondly remembered my Mumbai days. I just adore the Trains !! . Particularly the Locals in Mumbai . They come packed with Crowds mostly five times their capacity during peak hours but hold an unknown fascination for me .                                         Right from the Railway stations ( The first time I saw Dadar station I was flabbergasted becos that was the first time in my life I was seeing so many platforms !! ) , to the ticket counters ( I once stood in a queue in Thane for 50 minutes to travel to Ghatkopar - A journey of 15 minutes !!) , The announcers ( Always found that the female announcers had a much cute patient way of announcing ) , The crowds ( The eternal Mumbai joke : there are only two differences between traveling by first class & second class in Mumbai Local Trains . The first difference is people put on deodorant in first class & they invariably don't in Second & people swear in English/Hindi in first class and in Marathi in second Class !! ) .                                             I would have easily won the frequent traveler award had there been one during my two years in Mumbai since my work used to take me all around Mumbai everyday in the Trains. The first day I took the Train , I learnt the most valuable lesson viz. never wear slippers . I later also learnt the art of moving with the crowds , traversing from one entrance to other (Since platforms alternate between Left & right) , Choice of Slow Vs Fast trains , The art of reading a Newspaper/magazine when there are 20 people in 1ft circumference around you . The beautiful stations of Navi Mumbai ( I used to joke that Jui Nagar railway station is better than Sahar International Airport !!) to the fast trains of Western Railway to the Long trains in Central Railway .                                               I miss all this fun now . Mumbai train memories I am sure I will cherish fondly forever.

        B-School Diversity                                    One of the main things a B-school looks for is Diversity in its students . Was reading today's ET when I was surprised to learn that Bengt Baron , CEO of Absolut Vodka was a Olympic Gold Medalist . He was a Olympic Gold Medalist in swimming at the Moscow Olympics (1980) & a bronze winner at the Los Angeles Olympics (1984) . Then did his MBA from University of Berkeley (Haas School of Business ) & after stints at Mckinsey & Co , Kodak & Coke is now the CEO of the Swedish Vodka powerhouse .

        Jokes from Jay Leno Show    1. Starting this week all foreign visitors entering the United States will now be fingerprinted and photographed. I think that’s okay. I mean you can’t get a membership at Costco unless you’re fingerprinted and photographed. I mean America should be harder to get into than Costco.  2. Mexico’s President Vicente Fox said that Mexico’s relationship with America has its ups and downs. That’s right. Their people come up here and our jobs go down there.  3. Boy that Britney works quick doesn’t she? She parties with a guy, decides to marry him, goes through with the wedding, gets a lawyer, gets out of the marriage, all in like 50 hours. She’s like J. Lo on speed.

        Langue desordre ( Language Confusion)                                                                     I realize one thing now . I know no language perfectly . My mother tongue is Tamil . At work , we are learning the Phonetics of English to help us neutralize our accent . I am of course learning Hindi everyday by constantly communicating with Colleagues and friends . Now , started learning French on Weekends at Alliance Francaise , N.Delhi .   My English Tutor tells me I speak English too fast . There is a strong Indian influence in my English .   My Friends & colleagues tell me my Hindi lacks the Haa's & Bha's and sounds like a typical Madrasi Hindi .   Our French Tutor of course is working on making us forget our English , so that we could understand & pronounce French properly.                                                              Thankfully my Tamil still remains tolerable else I would have wondered what the heck have I been doing last 20 odd years .

        French Connection                                                                      Bonjour !! My French classes started on Saturday . French seems to be a very interesting language . English owes most of its words to Anglo-Saxon ( German in old days) & French . Thus learning French would make one an expert etymologist in English. Learnt Days of the week , Months of the year , Numbers , Verbs , Pronouns & nouns . The pronunciation remains sketchy though . However , learning a new language it lot of fun & interesting.

        CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)                                                                       We all owe something back to the society . Because after all the society has been responsible to a larger extent in our upbringing and also as a privileged lot we need to give back to the under-privileged. Never give money to the poor , educate him or give him the skill to earn that money . Illiteracy is the biggest evil plaguing modern India and is the root cause of most of our social evils. Let us dream of an India with literacy , social equality & prosperity .                                                  These were my thoughts when I was elected to Social Services Committee at my office 6 months back . Thanks to my company , I got an opportunity to work with the under-privileged and the last six months have been very fulfilling since I have spent a lot of Quality time with them and initiated a lot of projects aimed at their well-being. So it was with increasing interest that I read the urlLink  article  on CSR in last week's Business World. Its good to see so many companies giving back to the society . Let us redeem our Tryst with Destiny .

        Noida - Capitalism at work                                                                             I am in a happy mood today . Two reasons , I had power all day today after a hellish last two weeks where I had power supply at my house only for 100 Hours out of the total 336 Hours (two weeks) ( Tough to believe but then that is Noida , Its hell during peak summer & winter ) and the other reason being the Sun shone out brightly today after almost a month of extreme cold .                                    Noida is a perfect example of Capitalism . They rob the poor & reward the rich . I live in the Outskirts of Noida close to my office. Hence our Area goes without  power for almost 12 hours a day during peak winter & summer so that people in affluent areas could remain cozy in their Heaters,Geysers or AC's . Its like a trip back to stone age when you have power only from 10pm to 6 am ( When you don't need it !!) . If Noida , which is the Industrial Base and one of the most affluent areas of UP suffers this fate , I shudder to think of Rural UP & Bihar and the other cities.

        End of the Ice Age                                      The world's most gritty cricketer Steve "ice" Waugh has bid adieu to the Test Cricket . Another Sporting Legend ( After Pete sampras) leaves the stage to conquer millions of hearts in Kolkata . Steve is the ultimate role model for mental toughness , a very important trait in any form of sport . The 200  Against W.Indies at Jamaica in 1995 still stands in my eyes as one of the finest innings in this era. I am glad in a way that he is retiring , because he is now going to be an ambassador for hundreds of under-privileged citizens of Kolkata. Steve is not just a great cricketer , he is a great Human being which is much more rarer trait these days .

        My favorite 10 movies                                              A good movie is like a 24 carat Gold. Rare to find but immensely satisfying on seeing it . As an Avid Movie watcher , I have had the pleasure of seeing many such great movies . I  prefer movies in the genre of comedy , History & Drama. Tear-jerkers and action flicks are not my cup of tea. Here is an ode to my favorite films ( 3 English , 4 Hindi , 3 Tamil) :    GODFATHER  : ( Dir : Francis Ford Cappola , Cast : Marlon Brando , Al Pacino , Robert De Niro , Robert Duvall , Diane Keaton) adaptation of Mario Puzo's Novel about the Saga of Don Corleone & his family . It is the father of all Mob Dramas . Great Acting ( Brando , Al Pacino were awesome ) , Cinematography , Music and memorable dialogues (  I'll make him an offer he can't refuse ) . The film scores high both on Screenplay & the visual effects . The Sequel(part 2) was as good as the Original ( Though God father Part 3 was a fiasco) . This film even today remains an institution and numerous clones have been spawned from this masterpiece.    SCHINDLER'S LIST  : (Dir : Steven Spielberg , Cast : Liam Neeson , Ralph Fiennes , Ben Kingsley )  A poignant tale of how a Selfish industrialist later manages to save thousands of polish Jews from Holocaust .The wonder boy of Hollywood (Spielberg) shot the whole movie in B&W in a color era. Amazing Visuals , Moody Music and wonderful acting. The Last Scene Where Neeson breaks down in front of everyone is emotionally appealing. Well if you haven't cried during this movie , chances are you never will.  "The List is life".      FORREST GUMP  : (Dir : Robert Zemeckis , Cast : Tom Hanks , Sally Field) The amazing story of a simple , mentally challenged man who believes in Honesty & Trust . The underlying moral that innocence & honesty triumphs over anything else was told over a beautiful screenplay with some amazing visual digital imagery involving JFK , John Lennon . Tom Hanks just lives the Role . It won him a Consecutive Oscar in 1994.  "Life is like a Box of Chocolates"  .    PYAASA  : (Dir : Guru Dutt , Cast : Guru Dutt , Waheeda Rehman , Mala Sinha , Music : S.D.Burman )  This largely semi-autobiographical movie has long been acclaimed as a masterpiece. It shows the disillusionment of an idealistic poet with the society and the recognition he gets after his supposed death . The beauty of this movie is its coincidence with real life where Guru Dutt died young and was later hailed as a icon in movie-making. The Stunning Cinematography & Screenplay conveys the mood of a confused nation disillusioned with the Nehruvian socialistic principles and social apathy . The life of the movie are the lyrics of Sahir set to memorable tunes by the maestro R.D.Burman . "Jaane Vo Kaise " , "Jinhe Naaz Hai Hind " , "Yeh Duniya Agar Mil" are some of those immortal songs .    ANAND  : (Dir : Hrishikesh Mukerjee , Cast : Rajesh Khanna , Amitabh Bhachan , Music : Salil Chaudhury)A tale of two friends one who is terminally ill with Cancer and the other trying to save him. Anand's humor & zest for life is infectious and he makes you laugh when he laughs and makes you cry when he dies in the end.He enjoys & savors every moment of life and Rajesh Khanna immortalizes the role of Anand with Amitabh lending a good support . Hrishida's Direction is amazing. The sensitivity and the emotional appeal he brings to the movie is the hallmark of his direction. The movie has great music by Salilda ( Arguably his best ) with wonderful lyrics by Gulzar and some soulful singing by Mukesh . " Zindagi Kaise Hai paheli", "Kahin Door jab Din " , "Maine tere Liye" are songs that continue to haunt us even today.  "Babumoshaai".    GOLMAAL  : ( Dir : Hrishikesh Mukherjee , Cast : Amol Palekar , Utpal Dutt , Bindiya Goswami , Music : R.D.Burman ) To Think that Anand and Golmaal were directed by the same director is baffling which in itself is a tribute to the versatility of Hrishida. In my opinion Golmaal is the best in the humor genre with the antics of Amol Palekar and Utpal Dutt providing one with non-stop laughter . A story of mistaken identities and the subsequent Golmaal to fool the boss form absolutely hilarious encounters . Amol Palekar is too good and so is Dr. Masoom Raza with his witty dialogues. "Aanewala Pal" remains an evergreen melody even today .  "Baal Baal Bache".     DILWALE DULHANIA LE JAYENGE (DDLJ)  : (Dir : Aditya Chopra , Cast : Shah Rukh Khan , Kajol , Music : Jatin-Lalit )A candy floss NRI romance which captured the nation and the spirit of the 90's . Shot in exotic locales with stunning visuals ,the on-screen chemistry between Shah rukh and Kajol lights up the screen. Aditya Chopra made a dream debut with some slick direction and terrific screenplay and dialogues .The movie was one of the biggest grossers in Bollywood . Mellifluous music by Jatin Lalit with songs like "Tujhe Dekha" , "Mehndi Laga", "Ho Gaya Hai" .    KAADALIKKA NERAMILLAI  : (Dir : Sreedhar , Cast : Muthuraman , Ravichandran, Kanchana,Rajashree,Balayya,Nagesh) Humor rules supreme all through this wonderfully entertaining movie of forged identities by two close friends. Balayya is a Rich landlord with two beautiful daughters . Muthuraman loves the first daughter and Ravichandran the second . Muthuraman dons the rols of Ravichandran's Rich father to satisfy the greedy Balayya . The movie revolves around this plot with incredible humor provided by Nagesh , as Balayya's film crazy son. The episode where Nagesh recites an eerie story to Balayya is acknowledged as one of the best scenes in comedy even today . Sreedhar's screenplay , dialogues & direction are the sheer work of a genius. The film has wonderful music by Viswanathan-Ramamurthy with memorable songs like "Nenjathai Alli", "Yenna Paarvai", "Anubhavam Pudhumai" , "Naalam Naalam" .  "O-Ho Productions".     MOUNA RAAGAM  : (Dir : Mani Rathnam , Cast : Mohan , Karthik , Revathi , Music : Illayaraja)  The man who gave tamil cinema centerstage in the National Panorama , weaves a wonderful tale and explores the Relationship between a Husband & wife. Revathi was already in love with Karthik , who dies in a police encounter .She gets married to Mohan and starts hating him and the relationship from day one. How Mohan changes her and wins her over forms the rest of the Story. Mani's brilliance lies in the deft handling of human relationships and for well etched characters who form the backbone of the movie. All the Actors have done a fabulous job and the humor provides a welcome variation to an otherwise serious movie. The Locales around Delhi make up for stunning visuals and P.C.Sreeram's photography is awesome. The life of the movie is its music. Illayaraja proves to the world why he is hailed as a Maestro & Genius. Melodious songs like "Nilave Vaa", "Pani Vizhum" , "Manram vandha" combined with excellent background score where the BGM conveys the emotions of the characters with skillful choice of instruments .    MICHEAL MADANA KAMA RAJAN  : ( Dir : Santhana Barathy , Cast : Kamal Haasan , Nagesh , Kushboo , Manorama , Urvasi , Music : Illayaraja)Kamal's talent shines brightly all through this humorous movie. Kamal Haasan proves his versatility in this comic caper where he dons 4 roles - Thief , Cook , Fireman & Businessman . Its amazing the distinctness he provides to all these characters and no wonder he is recognized as the one of the finest actors in the country . The story is a perfect masala story about 4 brothers separated at birth and how they avenge their enemies.

        Blogging Tips                                    The Second most searched word last year on Google was Blogging. I Started my Blog thanks to my friend  GBS  ( urlLink Chaotic Solitude ) . Four of my friends have since started blogs,after seeing my Blog. So what makes a good blog ? Here are a few Blog Tips which I culled from the internet :   1. Frequency, good writing, and personality - a mix of all those is critical.  2. Use correct grammar, no misspellings, and make sure all punctuation is in the right place.   3. Remember that whatever you publish will be found and archived by Google and other search engines and Web sites. So really think carefully about what you are putting out there before you do it.   4. Avoid today I did this posts, unless what you did was extraordinary.   5. Don't worry about who is reading, and just write about what is interesting to you.   6. Before you begin blogging, figure out your boundaries. Decide how much or how little you are comfortable with disclosing.  7. Don't try to please an audience, and don't post simply because you feel like you ought to . only post when you have something to say.   8. Photographs liven up a blog and, if they are good, can really be worth 1000 words.   9. Retain your sense of self and style - don't constantly emulate and copy those around you.  10. Last but not the least , Know your audience.

        The Futility of War                                                          A Confession first . Seeing a Bollywood War movie gives me no expertise to comment on what happened at Kargil or on what war is all about . But there is no denial about the Futility of lives being lost because of enmity & hatred.                                                       Saw the Movie LOC - Kargil yesterday . It was an epic movie spanning four Hours . The movie leaves most Indians with a feeling of Patriotism & exhilaration . The Locations are terrific and most of the Star Cast ( Its almost a who-is-who of Bollywood ) has acted very well particularly Ajay Devgan & Saif Ali Khan . But on the downside it has portrayed the war as a one-sided story with expletives thrown liberally all over the movie.                                                       I have always had great admiration for people in the Defence forces. I like their immense self-confidence & discipline and their patriotism in serving the Nation.                                                       If you allow your Head to rule your heart , you start wondering why the heck are so many people fighting over something which if given the right initiatives could be solved peacefully. Mutilation , maiming , Torture all is fair in war . Is that what a sane thinking individual would resort to ? Consider the Billions of Rupees which India & pak would have spent on these wars which otherwise could have been used for their country's Development . War is never a solution .                                   I remember this Classic War Quote by Benjamin Franklin  "There never was a good war or a bad peace".

        Building Respect , Brick by Brick                                                          Here is an excerpt from an article by Subroto Bagchi (COO & President,Mindtree Consulting) in Businessworld.Good one.                                                          Gone are the days when political leadership was the icon of a nation. Today, a country's pre-eminence in the comity of nations is directly related to how many institutions it has been able to build. Names like Sony, Matsushita, Honda, Epson and Mitsubishi are not just companies any more. They are institutions. Building institutions is not an accident. It is a slow, laborious process. People must recognise it as a larger goal and relate to the over-arching vision. Today, companies like Infosys, Ranbaxy, Jet Airways, The Taj Hotels, TVS and Wipro are no longer just places of business. These symbolise India's achievements and aspirations.   The typical Japanese work ethic is central to their institution building. The average Japanese worker goes to work for a career, no doubt. But they are also known to be acutely aware and proud that their work and output is linked to keeping Japan high in the esteem of the world. Japanese workers are known to have a mental sequence of what constitutes a priority. It is country first, company next and individual last. Contrast that concept with the way we have been brought up in the last 50-plus years of independence. Our sequence is - myself first, my company next, and last comes my country. That pecking order is probably a legacy of a survivalist past, and, to some extent, the history of imperial rule. To go forward, we need a change in mindset. People who build institutions need to think in longer terms and make many personal needs subservient to the larger process.   I heard a simple story long ago. Two men were laying bricks. A passer-by asked the first one: "What are you doing?" He said he was laying bricks. Then he asked the second one. That man said: "I am building a temple." Building a temple requires different perspectives of architecture, structural strength and visual sensitivity. Above all, it requires 'oneness' with a need that is very different from here and now, a need for personal survival and self-definition.

        Brand Loyalty                            Most of us are Brand conscious . We buy a particular brand of Paste / washing powder / soap / TV regularly and are proud of it. Was thinking about it today and discussing it with my brother & came up with a list of my Brand favorites :    Toothpaste -- Colgate  -- For ages I have been buying Colgate . Can't think of having ever used another Brand.    Bath Soap -- Pears --  Though I have changed this brand occasionally , on the whole I seemed to have used Pears most often than others .    Washing Soap -- Rin  -- Never used any other Soap Bar than Rin.    Hand Wash -- Dettol  -- Its always been there beside my wash Basin.    Health Drink - Horlicks  -- Since I neither drink coffee nor Tea , Horlicks has been my favorite drink for years.I love that taste.    Music System -- Phillips  -- Had a Phillips system at Chennai , bought one in the US , Bought a Phillips TV at Chennai , Bought a Phillips Boombox at Delhi . I have been a very loyal fan of Phillips.    Shaving -- Gillette  - Once again both the Foam & Razor has always been Gillette .    Headache reliever -- Amrutanjan  -- Its always there in my Medical Kit .

        India Shining                             India shining campaign has met with with as much criticism as exuberance. Though there is no denial that the ads are an election stunt (That money is well off spent elsewhere) , the truth is that India is definitely shining in some areas.                                         In my opinion the biggest achievement is that Indians have started believing in themselves & also now for the first time truly believe that we can become a superpower. To me that is "India Shining "and not the mere numbers .

        Fear of failure - Michael Jordan                               Most of us fear failure. But we don't realize that failure is our biggest teacher. We hardly learn anything from success. I was at the cubicle of my colleague & found this on pasted on his Desk . Thought will make a good reading :    I know fear is an obstacle for some people, but it is an illusion to me . . . Failure always made me try harder next time.Heart is what separates the good from the great.I've always believed that if you put in the work, the results will come.   I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.   If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up.Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it .   You have to expect things of yourselves before you can do them  ----  Michael Jordan

        Brand Equity Quiz                                  Yesterday evening was lots of fun with Brand Equity Quiz. Though we lost , the Quiz was oodles of fun. Derek O'Brien was at his witty,naughty best . We missed out on some pretty easily guessable questions. However , I got an audience question right and managed to come home with some gift vouchers as a consolation. For my partner Vijai it turned out to be a much enjoyable evening. For him it was a mini IIM-L 2003 Alumni meet since he met most of his batchmates there & had fun.                                                  Publicis (The ad Co) won the delhi round and did some very intelligent answering in the last rounds.

        Education of Poor                                                                       Most of the Social evils plaguing India owe their roots to illiteracy . As the Chairman of the Social Services Committee at my office, I have been fortunate to work with a lot of NGO's which has given me some understanding of how things work at the grass root level. I have been associated with the NGO,Deepalaya in Delhi since last few months.                                                     It had been on my mind since last few months to sponsor a poor child at one of their schools. Finally , I put that thought into action today and I would be sponsoring a girl Child's education ( 5 Year old hailing from a very poor family) from this academic year . India's future lies in how fast we abridge the chasm between the literate & the illiterate.

        OUTSOURCING - US Protests                                                   Well the recent wave of protests against outsourcing is rather surprising. But one musn't forget that its the Election year in the US. As Khrushchev said "Politicians are the same all over: they promise to build a bridge even where there is no river". So most of it could be due to the looming elections. However , found a good write-up in TOI today . Read this story & find out why neither (US nor India) are right :    I N D I A S P O R A   A small frown in America   Chidanand Rajghatta   Clintwood, Virginia (population about 2,000), is not a town you will see easily on a regular map of the United States. Nestling amid the Appalachians on the Virginia-Kentucky border, it is what you would call ‘boondocks’ in city parlance, a place so remote that even the nearest big cities, Johnson City and Lexington, barely register on the urban American landscape. It is 98 per cent white. There are no Patels or Singhs. The only Indians locals know are native Americans, who are 0.6 per cent of the population. The economic and social indices of the town during the past decade were dismal.     However, for the past three years, Clintwood rejoiced at having struck a small economic bonanza. In 2001, the Internet company Travelocity decided to locate a call centre here. Nothing big. It began with a 250-seat customer service centre, but it provided a way out of the hardscrabble existence for a community that for years depended on employment in the area’s dying coal mines and disappearing apparel industry. In time, the call centre was to grow to a 500-seater, making Travelocity the largest private employer in Dickenson County, where Clintwood is located.     The County went out of its way to embrace the newbie online firm, proud to become even a minor techno blip in an America hooked on the Internet. It gave tax breaks to Travelocity. It forked out a $250,000 loan to expand the facility. The local congressman rounded up $1.4 million in federal funding for a childcare centre next to the call centre, with 45 of 107 slots promised to Travelocity.     For 30 months, Clintwood and its Dickenson County Technology Park thrived. Travelocity was the showpiece of white collar employment in blue collar boonies. Young men and women (80 per cent) of backwoods USA found work answering calls from all over the country in their sweet southern accents. Life was good.On Wednesday morning, it all ended quite unexpectedly. A senior Travelocity executive informed them the call centre was being closed by December. Travelocity lost $55 million last year and was falling behind rivals such as Expedia, which were outsourcing such jobs abroad to cut costs.Travelocity had to follow suit, and send the jobs to India. Employees would get some severance pay and there would be a few openings at facilities in Texas and Pennsylvania. Otherwise, they had ten months to figure out what to do.There was shock and gasps as the announcement filtered through, a few sobs and sniffles. Although they had heard of outsourcing, no one had seen it coming to Clintwood. At $8 to $10 an hour, they were at the bottom end of America’s salary scale. How much could the company save by moving the jobs to India? About $10 million a year, company officials said. The arithmetic was a little more complicated than mere wages.     When I called Clintwood Mayor Donald Baker on Thursday, he accepted my sympathies and queries with karmic calm. ‘‘We have been here before and we will get through it,’’ he said. The county was talking to two other telecom companies to see if they wanted to come in and take over the facilities.Will Mullins, 23, hopes they will. He was just beginning to enjoy white collar service and does not fancy going back to the construction job that paid him just above minimum wages ($5.50 an hour).     It’s not just Wall Street and Silicon Valley which are stung by outsourcing. Middle America is hurting too and that is why the politicians are upset.

        V-Day                  The Valentine's day every year comes with a baggage of Hype,Hoopla,Glitz & protests . So what are you doing on V-day ? is the most asked question this month. Well the answer is I will be doing what I used to do before I knew something called V-Day existed. Love is a private emotion & the hype just paints shame on such a wonderful emotion. I remember reading a Ghazal by the Great Sahir on Love & Taj Mahal :   ye chamanazaar ye jamunaa kaa kinaaraa ye mahal ye munaqqash dar-o-diivaar, ye maharaab ye taaq ik shahanashaah ne daulat kaa sahaaraa le kar ham Gariibo.n kii muhabbat kaa u.Daayaa hai mazaak mere mahabuub kahii.n aur milaa kar mujhase!  (Translation : Known throughout the world as a symbol of love and for its beauty, the Taj Mahal, in Sahir's opinion, is an insult to the love and aspirations of the millions of common men and women who live their lives quietly, toiling,sweating, ceaselessly working to scratch a living, and amongst all that, still finding the time and optimism to love. They don't have the wherewithall to proclaim their love by building something as grandiose as the Taj Mahal but that does not mean that there love is any less than that of any emperor.)

        IIM's & IIT's Vs HRD Ministry                                                      The feud seems to never end . God knows the Logic behind Mr.Joshi's decision to implement only select recommendations of the U.R.Rao Committee Recommendations. The IIT's & IIM's India's only World Class institutions are in the danger of losing their autonomy . Found this nice article in Hindustan times's Editorial Page by Sandipan Deb (An IIT-IIM Alumnus) on this controversy:    In a few weeks from now, the campaigning will begin for the Lok Sabha elections. And Dr Murli Manohar Joshi will be boasting to vast crowds across the country of how, by slashing the IIMs’ academic fees, he has made the country’s best management education accessible to the less-well-off and the poor. It will be a straight lie.  The decision to dramatically reduce the fees is unnecessary, stupid and dangerous. Unnecessary, because, one, the admission process of the IIMs, one of the toughest and fairest such tests in the world, makes no distinction between rich and poor. You could be the prime minister’s grandson, but you stand as much (or rather, as little) chance of getting in as a poor farmer’s son from Jhoomritelaiya. (I did not give this example for effect. I interview for IIM Calcutta every year, and a few years ago, I was privileged to recommend admission for an engineer whose father and elder brothers still tilled a small plot of land at Jhoomritelaiya.)  I, like every other alumnus of the IITs or IIMs, have personally known dozens of boys and girls from impoverished or rural backgrounds who have got into these premier institutes through sheer merit and transformed their own lives, and the lives of their families and communities. More than creating poster boys for Silicon Valley and Wall Street, this empowerment of thousands of disadvantaged Indians to reach their true potential is the signal achievement of the IITs and IIMs.  Two, no IIM alumnus I know has ever heard of someone getting an admission to an IIM and then not joining because he or she couldn’t afford it. If you do not have the money to pay the fees — and the fees, let’s admit it, are pretty steep (as they should be, more on that later) — you just walk into the nearest bank. An IIM offer letter is 24-carat collateral as far as any bank is concerned.  Since the early Nineties, when the government started cutting its subsidies to the IIMs, hundreds of students have availed of these loans and paid back the loan after they graduated. In fact, you need not take my word for it. Check the government’s latest India Shining ad. “By choosing to study further, I widen my knowledge,” it reads. “By taking a loan for my education, I share the burden with my parents. By taking care of their savings, I help them live a richer life... I make my India shine. I am India Shining.” The ad also mentions that anyone — for example, Murli Manohar Joshi — wishing to know more about educational loans at lower interest rates can email information@indiashining.com.  The fee-slashing decision is stupid, because, by increasing the government subsidies to the IIMs to reduce the fees, it just ends up wasting some more taxpayers’ money.  In effect, each IIM student every year is now going to get an extra subsidy of Rs 1.2 lakh from your and my pockets. We are going to make the IIM product 80 per cent cheaper. But are you and I going to enjoy the benefits of that product? No. Those are going to be enjoyed by blue-chip corporations across the world who are going to recruit these hotshot MBAs.  Are these would-be-gods, in their gratitude to you, me, Dr Joshi and the nation for making their education inexpensive, going to join the social sector, or manage our transportation or healthcare systems? A few of them will, and they would have done so even if their fees had not been reduced. The vast majority will join the Citigroups and Goldman Sachs of the world, earn salaries that look like telephone numbers, and pay taxes in the country they are posted in. In these times, when finding safe investment options which guarantee you anything more than 7 per cent a year is nearly impossible, Dr Joshi has just created a scheme with a startlingly high return on investment. Most IIM students would be recouping their entire expenses — academic and non-academic — within the first two months of their working lives!  So, instead of spending money where it is needed, improving our basic school system, the government is actually shelling out our hard-earned tax money to subsidise giant multinational corporations! I am seriously considering joining the Swadeshi Jagran Manch.  And finally, the decision is dangerous, because making the IIMs totally dependent on subsidies could be the first step towards the government taking charge of all aspects of these fine institutes. Ask any alumnus or faculty of the IITs and IIMs, and all of them, invariably, will tell you that the most important reason for these being centres of such excellence is that the Indian government has always let them be. Successive governments have given the IITs and IIMs freedom to chart their own course. Once Dr Joshi and his minions establish complete financial control of the IIMs, surely it’s only a matter of time before they start meddling with appointments and syllabi.  And we know where that road is going to lead to. Dr Joshi has already announced his intent to change the admission process, have a government body conduct the entrance examinations, do away with the interviews and group discussions. This will open up the admission system to political and bureaucratic manipulation, have a serious impact on the quality of the intake, and deny these institutes their fundamental right to choose who they want to admit and teach. And this could just be the beginning.  There are so few institutions we have built post-Independence that are still left unsullied. Indira Gandhi’s cynical politics damaged our public sector and banking system so grievously that they still haven’t recovered. The IITs and IIMs are almost the last few systems we have that are world-class. While his government speaks of aggressive disinvestment, the human resource development minister is hell-bent on nationalising our finest educational structures. And regiment our finest minds. For, education is finally about minds, both teacher and student. And the minds are the final prize that Dr Joshi will be looking to grab and tweak. He must be stopped.  The writer, an IIT-IIM alumnus, is Managing Editor of Outlook. He is also the author of The IITians

        Inspiring thoughts                                       I would be quite busy the whole of this week. Found some good inspiring thoughts to share :   1. "None of us will ever accomplish anything excellent or commanding except when he listens to this whisper which is heard by him alone." - Ralph Waldo Emerson   2. "The greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do." - Walter Bagehet  3. "We should not let success go to our heads, or our failures go to our hearts." - Unknown  4.

        Khakee                     I saw the movie Khakee on Sunday. A very taut , action-paced screenplay with great visuals and some wonderful acting . AB,Ajay Devgan,Akshay Kumar in particular had acted very well. The first half just zooms past at an incredible speed and though the second half is typical hindi cinematic , it still not a bad movie. Rajkumar Santhoshi's Dialogues are very good. However , the songs are unwarranted and mar the pace of the movie.                          The movie somehow to me seemed very similar to L.A.Confidential (*ing Kevin Spacey,Russel Crowe). Apart from being a story of three cops, the other coincidence is the nature of their characters & a top official sending them on a wild goose chase.                       Hindi Cinema is caught in a transition these days. They want to improve but still want to satisfy the front benchers ( Item numbers ?) and end up satisfying neither . Mr.Santoshi , People would have liked the movie a lot more without those meaningful songs . The audience you are trying to satisfy do not come to such movies . So why such songs ?

        Weekend                       The weekend was quite hectic with Washing Clothes ,Cleaning the House ,Studies , French classes & the movie Khakee. Also my cousin had come to Delhi from Sydney for a few days and I met her almost after 4 years. It was funny when she recollected that within those 4 years I had lived in 6 different cities & changed 3 companies !!                              Also managed to Update my Photo Gallery on webshots (I will post the Link) . Uploaded some photos. Next time I visit Chennai will have to upload the others.

        US Democratic Presidential Candidates                                                        John Kerry has won it. Almost . The Iowa & New hampshire results have given a surprising win for Kerry which he has further consolidated in the last few days. Howard Dean , surprisingly has done rather badly in the elections with Joe Lieberman & Wesley Clark now distant in the race. Al Gore's VP Nominee , Joe Lieberman , had he won would have been the first Jewish to contest the US Presidential polls. (Had it happened , a rather unprecedented surprise even bigger than JFK , a Roman Catholic winning the US Elections) . Afterall the US President is one of the most powerful man on earth and hence this Elections is of immense interest to everyone & also let us see if Saddam's capture can save Bush from Defeat.                                       On a Humorous Note, its been a great time for the American Late Night shows with Dem Elections . Here are some quotes from the Tonight show with Jay Leno :   1. Today in the "L.A. Times, one critic wrote that the problem with John Kerry "is he looks like he thinks too much. Well you won't hear anyone accusing President Bush of that.  2. Today Dennis Kucinich vowed to stay in the presidential race. "Stay in? How about get in?   3. Howard Dean was out talking about health care today it has nothing to do with the campaign, I think he realizes he is going back to being a doctor real soon.   4. You all excited about this big Democratic race heating up? In his big victory speech the other night, Senator John Kerry said he wanted to defeat George Bush and "the economy of privilege." And then he hugged his wife, Teresa, heir to the multimillion-dollar Heinz food fortune.   5. General Wesley Clark has spoken out both in favor and against the decision to go to war with Iraq. In fact, this weekend in South Carolina, he'll be debating himself.  6. Lieberman did well in the exit polls. Every poll said he should exit.

        Indian Legal system ?                                                     The Delhi High court in a judgement today acquitted all public servants including Rajiv Gandhi from the Bofors Scandal. Most of the prime Accused in the case are already dead. I am wondering how the judge felt announcing a verdict acquitting a person who has been dead for 13 years now. How ridiculous is that ?? The Indian Legal system with its Lakhs of pending cases needs a complete overhaul. Imagine a Judge sitting in the Chair and announcing in 2004  " I pronounce as Guilty Mr.X for the Theft he committed on August 30th , 1987 in the Y case " . Come on , give us a break.                        When Arun Jaitley , an eminent lawyer himself , took over as the Law Minister a few years back there were lots of expectations that the legal system would be modified to deliver swift decisions which are of chronological relevance. But nothing much seemed to have Changed.                                         It is said "Justice delayed is Justice Denied" . Hope the Indian Legal system gets a much needed breather of fresh life. Found an interesting  urlLink article  by CVC (Chief Vigilance Commissioner ) on the same & also here is the urlLink  Chronology  of  Bofors events.

        Battle at a Different Terrain - Airtel Vs Hutch                                                They are the most fierce competitors in the GSM Arena. However , the battle off late has shifted to a different terrain Viz Advertising. I am not a GSM user and hence have no idea about their Quality of Service. However, Their Ads are awesome .                                                    The Hutch Ad is already the rage of the Nation . The Cute Boy & the dog which follows him everywhere with some great music has caught the fancy of the Nation. O&M Once again proves itself as one of the most Creative Ad agencies. The Sale of pugs (the dog used in the commercial) have skyrocketed .My personal favorite among the different versions is the one where he is seen writing the exam and the pug is seen cutely sitting beside.                                                   The Airtel Ad too has a nice Concept - Express Yourself. A picture can say a thousand words. The ads based on the entire gamut of Human emotions urges people to express them . The Visuals are good and the concept in itself is much more intellectual & stimulating. Rediffusion & DYR has done a great job.                                                    Hope both Airtel & Hutch improve their service to match up to the Quality of the Ads.

        MyDoom - Worm                    Internet these days is a dangerous place. The Mydoom virus has now officially been declared as the most destructive Virus ever,causing Billions of Dollars in Loss. The Variant A caused the SCO Site to be shut down on Monday due to Denial of Service Attacks. The Variant B targeted Microsoft website today but petered out due to inferior code. However, the most worrying statistic is that 20% of all emails circulated on internet were Mydoom emails (During its peak infection period) . As someone, who has worked as a Security Admin warding off Spam & viruses , I have had my fair share of fire-fighting with the Viruses,worms & spam and know how virulent they can be.                                       To think that an Hacker could Blackmail SCO and be successful ( SCO couldn't ward off the attack though they knew a few days before the day of attack) , proves that Internet could have finally met its nemesis in itself. Both Microsoft & SCO have announced $2,50,000 as reward for anyone helping to catch the Hacker responsible for this attack. For those wondering why SCO & MS have been targeted , the answer is, right now these two are the biggest enemies to the Open Source movement ( MS becos of obvious reasons & SCO becos of Intellectual property squabble with IBM over Linux Licensing ) .                                        The Spam is still thriving & continues to grow. Out of the 100 mails I receive in a day in various mail accounts almost 95 are spam. Unless we rein in Worms,viruses & spam,the internet will continue to remain a murkier world where anything is possible.

        CLEAN,GREEN DELHI                                                         That is the motto of the DDA (Delhi Development Authority) . This weekend I got to see the good side of Delhi (The one sans pollution,Traffic Jam) . After the NDTV Shooting on Saturday ,  Venkat & I headed to a South Indian Restaurant "Nayvedhyam" in Hauz Khas , Delhi. The restaurant had great ambiance filled with Tanjore paintings & wonderful south Indian Thali served in authentic Plantain leaf .                                      We then headed to the Deer Park. The Deer park was  recently in the news for its overcapacity of Deers (The authorities were considering Sterilizing the deers to control over-crowding) . The park had hundreds of Spotted Deers , a few Nilghais & plenty of Rabbits and ducks. We crossed over to the Rose Garden which is a dream spot for joggers & walkers. The Roses were in all colors and in full Bloom . I took plenty of snaps with my SLR camera. The trees and the gentle breeze make this place a must visit for any nature lover.                                             We then drove to the "Garden of five Senses"in Mehrauli (near Qutab-Minar) . Its a park dedicated to the five senses of Humans viz Sight,Hearing,Touch,Smell,Taste. It had tastefully ornated gardens , Cacti,Bamboos and Solar power units. Its a very quiet place far from the chaos of Delhi and a great place to spend an evening.                        Already DDA has done a wonderful job by quadrupling trees in last 5 years and with such gardens Delhi truly has the potential to regain its status as the Metro of choice to the tourists.

        NDTV - Big Fight                               NDTV has been calling me up for the last few weeks asking me if I was interested in attending their "Big Fight Program". Since I didn't have french classes this saturday, I decided to go &  be part of the Audience during the Shooting of the Program "Big Fight" hosted by Rajdeep Sardesai on Saturday. The Topic was "Do Indians prefer Dynasty (Read Nehru family) rule ? " . The BJP and the Congress got into a verbal duel ( they even fought during the commercial break time!!) with Omar Abdulhah(NC) providing some unbiased inputs. The program was recorded very well in the studio and I was lucky that my Question " Even in family run businessess the progeny spends at least 10 years in different depts/positions before gunning for the CEO post . Why does Congress , a 119 year old party with 10 million members convey the desperation that only the Nehru family can save them ? " got selected as the first question and I got my 20 seconds of TV Time and my Question was answered by Anand Sharma (Spokesperson,Congress) & Omar Abdullah. Got a first-hand experience of the Animosity of our politicians .

        Alternate Careers - Part-1                                               I always keep wondering what I would have become had I not entered the IT Industry ( The IT Industry would definitely have been better off !! ) . Never at any point in my career was I fascinated by computers and it just turned out to be an accident. This series of posts is just an attempt to travel back in time and find out the ambitions I had at different phases in my career and a dig at myself.                                                                   I was in the 7th Standard when we relocated from T.Nagar to Nanganallur (An orthodox Suburb full of temples) in Madras. The new School , Chellammal Vidyalaya was one of the best things which happened to me. It was a very small School compared to my earlier School (Adarsh School in T.Nagar) and thus gave me a lot of cultural & academic freedom/oppurtunities to pursue.                                                           My favourite subject at school turned out to be History. Since I used to be a voracious reader of Amar Chitra Katha,Poonthalir & Tinkle , I was very good at the subject knowing a lot of branch stories (Literal Translation of Kilai Kathaigal !!). . I also happened to listen to a Tamil Drama " Tughlaq" by Cho and was very inspired by the character Ibin Batutah (a Persian Historian in the play) . At that point I decided I wanted to become an Historian . I didn't know what Historians do (Probably still don't !) but nevertheless decided it was my dream. I was a big hit at School with the Historical Dates,Tales & folklore all of which lasted till 10th standard. By that time i realized there was no career worth pursuing in history and it was a quite goodbye to History.                                         On a positive note my fascination with history has still continued and helped me a lot during my numerous travels across India .                                                           More on the next fascination .........................

        Leadership Series                                    We have started a series of Lectures by eminent personalities at our workplace on Leadership. The First lecture was given by Bharatanatyam exponent Leela Samson. Last week the second lecture was delivered by Sandipan Deb ( Managing Editor , Outlook ) and the author of the Recent Book " IITans " (Sandipan is an Alumnus of IIT - Kgp & IIM - C ) .The Lecture was laced with self-deprecating humor and candor . He gave numerous examples of India Shining at the Research Institutions ( IISc,TIFR,IIT-M,IIT-Mum) . He was of the opinion that unless the Research facilities in premium institutes and rural entrepreneurship/education is encouraged , we still might miss the superpower bus . He spoke with a lot of affection about Prof.Ashok Jhunjhunwala of IIT- Madras , who is pioneering technology to the masses.

         Hire ‘attitude’ and then teach the ‘skills'                                                                       Read this wonderful story in " Kumudam" .    One stormy night many years ago, an elderly man and his wife entered the lobby of a small hotel in Philadelphia. Trying to get out of the rain, the couple approached the front desk hoping to get some shelter for the night."Could you possibly give us a room here?" the husband asked. The clerk, a friendly man with a winning smile, looked at the couple and explained that there were three conventions in town.   "All of our rooms are taken," the clerk said. "But I can't send a nice couple like you out in the rain at one o'clock in the morning. Would you perhaps be willing to sleep in my room? It's not exactly a suite, but it will be good enough to make you folks comfortable for the night."   When the couple declined, the young man pressed on. "Don't worry about me; I'll make out just fine," the clerk told them. So the couple agreed.   As he paid his bill the next morning, the elderly man said to the clerk, "You are the kind of manager who should be the boss of the best hotel in the United States. Maybe someday I'll build one for you." As they drove away, the elderly couple agreed that the helpful clerk was indeed exceptional, as finding people who are both friendly and helpful isn't easy.   Two years passed. The clerk had almost forgotten the incident when he received a letter from the old man. It recalled that stormy night and enclosed a round-trip ticket to New York, asking the young man to pay them a visit.   The old man met him in New York, and led him to the corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street. He then pointed to a great new building there, a palace of reddish stone, with turrets and watchtowers thrusting up to the sky.   "That," said the older man, "is the hotel I have just built for you to manage."   "You must be joking," the young man said.   "I can assure you that I am not," said the older man, a sly smile playing around his mouth.   The old man's name was William Waldorf Astor, and the magnificent structure was the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. The young clerk who became its first manager was George C. Boldt.

        Blood Donation                                   Its not just a Donation , It's a hope for millions. We Conducted a Blood Donation camp at our office yesterday and more than 250 employees donated blood. As Chairman of the Social Services Committee at my workplace , it was a wonderful learning experience for me in planning & executing such an event.                                                   People fascinate me .I had the unique opportunity of interacting from very close quarters with my Team members,employees of my organization,Senior Management in my company,Doctors & Nurses from the Hospitals and office-bearers from Rotary Club ( we conducted the event in association with Rotary-Noida) . Over the years I have realized the ultimate winners are those who know how to jell with people .People management is an art. Gained some valuable insights on the above.

        Autograph - A simple Story                                                                               Saw the tamil movie Autograph last weekend. I wasn't too keen on seeing it but at my brother's insistence agreed to see it for a few minutes but ended up seeing the whole movie. I have always believed a good story/screenplay is the hero of a movie. By that count, Autograph was a wonderfully etched movie with a simple story and powerful screenplay. Its one of those movies to which you can relate and have seen it happening to yourself or numerous friends of yours. Kudos to Director Cheran for making a Clean,decent film !!

        Corporate Social Responsibility                                                            Here is an article that I wrote on Corporate Social Responsibility for my company's in house Magazine.    SSC - Corporate social responsibility   "India is Shining" proclaim the newspaper Ads.The knowledge workers from India are transforming the Globe and the Services Sector is booming at an incredible rate. As India strives to emerge as the next super power, it still reels under the weight of its 260 million people living below the poverty line. The greatest challenge for the nation going forward is to abridge the deep chasm between the rich and the poor. Vision 2020 is not merely the statement of the President , its an oath worth pursuing for every Indian.                     Corporate Social responsiveness is emerging as a beacon of light in India as companies endeavor to work for the under-privileged & poor. CSC India has been doing a wonderful job in contributing its mite to the upliftment of the under-privileged through its Social Services Committee (SSC).                    At SSC , we have :   1. Helped Schools with Infrastructure & materials.  2. Organized Blood Donation Camps 3. Participated in Pulse Polio & Hepatitis-B vaccination drives. 4. Donated Clothes to the poor  5. Raised awareness on safe driving  6. Conducted health check-ups in slums                             As Gandhiji Said "you must be the change you wish to see in the world".Social service starts at an individual,extends to the family,then to the society and ultimately to the Nation. Let us all redeem our tryst with destiny and pledge our support to social causes to uplift the nation towards its goal of economic & social prosperity.                                                                      At SSC , what we have done till now is just a drop in the Ocean.However , with all your whole hearted Support & encouragement we hope to achieve more and catapult our nation towards prosperity.  As Robert Frost said " The woods are dark,lovely & deep. But I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep,and miles to go before I sleep".

        Rukmini Devi Arundale                                          I was fortunate enough to attend a lec-dem on Creativity by Bhartanatyam dansue Padmashri Leela Samson last week. She was a very eloquent speaker who was Humility personified & attributed most of her success to her Guru Rukmini Devi Arundale.                                                         This year is the Birth Centenary year of the Multifaceted Iconoclast Rukmini Devi Arundale , the founder of Kalakshetra (The famous Dance School at Chennai ). Read about some of her towering achievements in the recent issue of India Today and was amazed by her versatility & achievements . Here are a few to list :   1. Was offered the Presidentship of India in 1977 by Morarji Desai which she resolutely refused.   2. As a Rajya Sabha Member was responsible for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal Act & Montessori method of Teaching.   3. As a 16-year old Tam-Bram Girl she breaked the tradition by marrying George S. Arundale , a Brit 20 years her senior.   4. Started learning Bharatanatyam at 29 ( a very late age ) but pioneered the Dance drama Genre & gave respectability to Dance . Founded Kalakshetra , the Dance School which is the cradle of the modern Dance movement in the South.

I had applied to a few Asian Schools and had an interview with the Director of IT & Operations Management,Nanyang last week which I did reasonably well .

        LAMP - Is it the future ?                                           Techies love Acronyms and here is one more to add. Was reading FORTUNE Mag which had an  article on the Open source movement and its growth. LAMP - Linux,Apache,MySQL,PHP(OS,Webserver,Database,PHP is used to write custom apps). These four are posing a considerable threat to Microsoft,Oracle,Sun & IBM . The Greatest thing about Open source is its constant innovation and ability to improve.They have also been responsible for the falling software prices thanks to their free/low fee models. To quote Mickos the founder of MySQL " Software has been overglorified for 20 years.you've been able to overcharge for underperforming software" .                             With Big players like IBM & Novell adopting a push towards the Linux movement and recent instances in Germany & India where Federal support for Linux has stunned Microsoft , we could assume that Linux has finally arrived. I interacted with Novell India yesterday and was surprised by their suite of products which includes a strong Suse Linux push (which they had acquired recently) . Fry's Electronics recently started selling low cost Linux PC's far as low as US$199 .                            LAMP might be beacon of light for low cost computing and in making PC's affordable to Billions of people across Asia & Africa.

        Power Walk                         Yesterday I went to the Rashtrapathi Bhavan & India Habitat Centre in Delhi. The Raj path (Road leading to Rashtrapathi Bhavan) was beautiful with lush grass on the sides and fountains . We walked across the North Block & South Block (the power centres of Finance & external affairs) and right upto the Rashtrapathi Bhavan Main Gate . Its imposing & serene on a sunday evening and the Gardens near the Fountains are a great place to rest and soak in some Indian political Nostalgia.                           We also visited the India Habitat centre in Lodhi Road which is the melting pot of Art & culture. Photo exhibitions,paintings,parallel/world cinema,theatre - Its a paradise for art lovers. It has a well-equipped library with a great collection of Books,magazines,CD-ROMs & DVDs. Nice place .

        Back in Delhi                           I am Back in Delhi. My thoughts are still clouded by the happenings of past week. The last few weeks were hell for my Thatha(Grandfather) since he had Cardiac,Renal & Liver problems and hence survived mostly on Life Support systems. I saw death from very close quarters,that too of someone with whom I was very close. I intend to write a Detailed obituary perhaps as a tribute to his acheivement & tenacity.                                                             When I started Blogging , I had no idea what I wanted to write. But I was sure of one thing , my personal details would be as less as possible. I have written in fact a lot on Travel,Business,Social Work,Music and other mundane daily observations. However, I realize that my personal life influences & dominates my everyday proceedings that it is tough to leave out those details. For example its tough for me to write on Indo-Pak Cricket when my Thatha was lying on the Deathbed. Personal stories if properly woven could be interesting & inspiring tales . Afterall what is world without Human achievement & tales.

        Chennai Details                                  The condition of my thatha(Grandfather) still continues to be critical. He had a massive heart attack today morning and is now in Life Support systems. I was supposed to go to Pondicherry today to visit the Aurobindo ashram & Auroville but had to cancel the visit because of the heart attack to my thatha.                                          As per my current plans , I would be leaving Chennai on Tuesday night (By Train) and reaching Delhi on Thursday morning. But all this depends on how the next 24 hours turn out to be.

        Life Sans/Avec TV                                     After having lived for years without a TV , I was forced to buy one last week. My brother has come to Delhi and at his insistence , I bought a Philips TV a few days back. I had consciously avoided having a TV since its an addiction which leaves with you with little time to pursue other interests.                                                            Nevertheless I am now looking forward to catch up on some movies which I have been wanting to see for a long time (Mostly60's/70's Hollywood/Bollywood fare) .

        Friends                       They came,they conquered and now they are going. After almost a Decade of ruling over the viewers the six friends are ready to hang up the boot. The last episode of the Sitcom would be telecast on 6th May. Friends is about to become History ( of course the re-runs will always be there) .   What makes the sitcom tick ?  The humour in Friends is genuinely funny and the vibe between the six characters is great so much so that the  friday office aircooler talks are always centered on the previous day episode of Friends or Seinfeld.                                   Though Seinfeld remains my favourite comedy sitcom , I have always enjoyed friends. Chandler & Phoebe are my favourites. Probably one day I will buy the entire episodes of Friends on DVD/VCD !

        Google                 No Company symbolises the internet as much as Google. Perhaps the biggest tribute to its search prowess , is that Google is used more as a verb these days than as a Noun. When Sergey Brin & Larry page built the search algorithm at Stanford , they would not have realized they would change the world in such a big way (Not to forget the way Google has changed their lives too with an impending IPO). As the company moves forward and introduces new tools it also faces tremendous competition from the Big boys Microsoft,Yahoo & others . Not only will Google compete with these rivals in the future but also It has to protect its search turf as Microsoft,Yahoo spruce up their search capabilities.                                The latest Businessweek had a nice  urlLink article  on the Challenges Google faces in the future and how important it is for the company and for the internet community the upshot of this new rivalry.

        Ranthambore Wildlife Sanctuary                                               " Ranthambore" . The mere mention of the name evokes exhilaration for nature lovers and ignites their passion towards the Tiger . Ranthambore Situated in Eastern Rajasthan ( 400 kms from Delhi) is one of the biggest success stories of Project Tiger and is named after the two hills surmounting the Sanctuary viz. Ran & Thambore.We (a Group of Six friends) decided to go there this past weekend and started on the Saturday early morning.At the end of 7 hours drive we finally reached Sawoi Madhopur (The nearest Town) . Ranthambore is a huge sanctuary covering around 450 Sq.kms and has around 42 Tigers (32 - Adults , 10 - cubs) and other animals like Leopard,Jackals,Hyena,Sloth Bears,Chitals,Chinkaras,Nilghais,Sambhars,Langurs,Peacocks,Alligators,mongoose and a large number of birds.                                There are two ways to travel inside the Sanctuary, either by Jeeps or by Canters . Jeeps are normally pre-booked months earlier (mostly by foreigners) but the open  canters are available for booking on the same day. There are two visits , either in the morning (6.30 am) or in the afternoon (3 pm) . We decided to take the Saturday afternoon and sunday morning trips.  We started our afternoon trip on a mini-canter (10 seater) . Inside the forest we spotted plenty of Deers (Sambhars,Chitals,Nilghais),Langurs,Peacocks. The forest was very dry and we decided to head towards the Rajbagh lake (the biggest of the lakes inside the forest) in the hope of sighting a Tiger heading towards the Jheel to quench its thirst.                                   Oh boy ! There it was. Sitting Majestically on a Mantap just close the Lake. The face was clearly visible,staring at us rather nonchalantly . We waited for more than 30 mins for it to get up but unfortunately it didn't.We also spotted plenty of water birds like Egrets,Painted storks,Herons,ibises,kingfishers etc. We were extremely excited on having sighted a tiger and headed back to the Hotel ( Hotel Ganesh - a decent one, close to the Railway station) .                                      The next morning we started again this time on a 20 seater canter. I was doubtful about sighting a tiger in the morning since it might not be feeling thirsty and hence would be deep inside the forest. We again spotted plenty of Deers,peacocks,Langurs and some mongoose too. Suddenly we saw a huge queue of vehicles ahead of us. In a forest this means someone has sighted a tiger. The next few minutes were unforgettable. We saw a Tigress almost 100 feet away from us sitting along with its cub (probably 2-3 years old). The tigress had lost all fear of humans and inspite of the 10 Jeeps/Canters with 100 odd people,it remained Phlegmatic , occasionally licking its cub. It was a marvelous sight , one I would cherish for a long time to come. We then went to see the Ranthambore fort (Built in 13th Century) , which was almost in ruins. But the view from the top of the fort was fantastic and after that we started driving back to Delhi in our Scorpio.                                       Although the Lion is hailed as the king of the forest , its the tiger that has fascinated Mankind for years . After having read the Jim Corbett Omnibus ( Books such as Man-eaters of Kumaon , Temple Tigers, Champawat Tiger) , I had always been fascinated by the Tiger . After visits to numerous sanctuaries around the country, finally got the opportunity to go to Ranthambore - the best of all.                                        The project tiger has been greatly responsible for saving this wonderful mammal from extinction . Tigers have been hunted for their coats and for medicinal purposes or as a token of hunting pride ( Only Humans psyche is capable of celebrating something as trivial as this , that too in a unevenly matched contest ).                                        Tigers are facing major population losses & extinction. Tigers are killed for sport, skins & body parts. The 1950s saw extinction of the Caspian tiger. The Bali and Java tiger are also extinct. India today has the largest number of tigers, between 3,600 to 4,000.    Why Save Tigers?                                       Tiger is symbol of wilderness and well-being of the ecosystem. By conserving and saving tigers the entire wilderness ecosystem is conserved. In nature, barring human beings and their domesticates, rest of the ecosystem is wild. Hence conserving wilderness is important and crucial to maintain the life support system. So saving tiger amounts to saving the ecosystem which is crucial for man's own survival.                                        Travel Tips :  The Best Time to sight a tiger is during hot summer months of April-June . Make sure that you plan at least two visits to increase your chance of spotting a tiger.Wear loose light clothes in Summer and Woolen in Winter. Always carry a Good camera & Binoculars to spot & photograph wildlife. Do not talk or make loud noises inside the sanctuary nor should one get down from the Vehicle. Keep your eyes & ears open and the mouth shut.

        Quality Control                              Quality is the mantra across boardrooms these days. ISO:9000/1, CMM Level 5, TQM,Deming,Six Sigma  etc are heard across the corridors of every organization as they strive to achieve Quality in all things .                                        If there is an Industry where Quality is the hallmark , then its the Food & Beverage Industry. Today one of my colleagues left the company and gave a Treat at Saravana Bhavan in Connought Place,Delhi.Well for all those uninitiated, Saravana Bhavan is as strong a Brand as Deming/Six Sigma when it comes to Quality. Though the Hotel Chain's owner got on the wrong side of the law , the food chain is still the ultimate food heaven for a madrasi. I am amazed at the way they maintain the Quality of their food. The reason why I am saying this is I have had saravana Bhavan food in Chennai,Delhi,Singapore & USA and all of them taste almost the same , which is no mean achievement.Quality doesn't just come only through Big five consultants & army of MBA's/engineers , Quality can be achieved even my modest people with the right intentions.

        GMAIL                  The long awaited king of mails has arrived. Ever since Google announced the unbelievable 1GB mailbox size , I had been wanting to sign up for Gmail. But Alas, the registration was restricted to only people who had invitation ( Suspiciously sounds like some 16th Century English aristocratic party !!) . All Blogger users were given the invite today (fellow bloggers logon to www.blogger.com ) and I got the login ID I wanted ( Isn't that an achievement in the mail parlance !!) . Hope GMAIL lives upto the tremendous reputation Google has built up in its other products. " Its a small step for mail users but a great leap for the internet ! "

        Okhla Bird Sanctuary                                      I had written about my visit to Okhla Bird Sanctuary a few weeks ago. Shouvik & I decided to spread awareness about the existence of such a Sanctuary and also the need to protect it. We posted a Write-up in the NDTV Website. Here is the  urlLink URL  .                                            Thanks to a friend of mine (Akash) , Hindustan Times also wrote an article about the neglect of the Sanctuary and we were interviewed for that article by Anu . The Article came in the Last Thursday edition of HT . I will try to scan it & post it soon. Sadly in India environmental awareness is the least of priority because we have far too many other problems to contend with. But the relation between Nature & Animals is a very tenuous one and unless we take steps to protect it , our survival would remain a question mark as we head towards the future.

I left my earlier job when I found that my new manager was impossible to work with .                                                        Great inventors not necessarily make great bosses. Was Reading the story of the Fairchild eight ( The Eight bright people who found Shockley - Inventor of Transistor , impossible to work with ) and left to found Fairchild Semiconductor.The eight men were Julius Blank, Victor Grinich, Jean Hoerni, Gene Kleiner, Jay Last, Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce, and Sheldon Roberts ( At least three names ring a Bell - Gordon Moore,Robert Noyce,Gene Kleiner).                               Gordon Moore,Robert Noyce later co-founded Intel,Gene Kleiner founded one of the biggest VC firms (KPCB - Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers). The other 5 amongst themselves co-founded Teledyne,Xicor . Wow . What an achievement for a group which was referred to as traitorous eight !    Here is their Photo :    .

        Control Your Destiny or someone else will                                                  Just finished reading this book. Though the book's title sounds like a Self-help Personality development book , the Book is about GE in the 80's & 90's and how it transformed itself from a Colossus to a nimble warrior.Here are the six golden rules of Jack Welch for doing business :   1. Control your destiny, or someone else will.   2. Face reality as it is, not as it was or as you wish it to be.   3. Be candid with everyone.   4. Don't manage, lead.   5. Change before you have to.   6. If you don't have a competitive advantage, don't compete.

        Crystal Ball Gazing - The FORTUNE Way                                                                          This must be the icing on the cake. Its just not our Self-belief , now the Globe believes that this century belongs to India & China. The FORTUNE issued Dated 12th April , is a special edition on the Golden Jubilee of Fortune 500 Lists (The Lists commenced in 1954). An article part of that issue was a futuristic prediction by Peter Schwartz ( Former Royal Dutch/Shell Executive & Creative consultant to movies like Minority report) about the Top 10 Fortune companies in 2054 . Here are some vignettes from that article (I am just posting some excerpts which are of relevance) :   Top 10 Companies in 2054 :   1.  AmazonBay  (Formed by Merger of Amazon & e-bay ) :  the first 500 company to break $10 trillion in revenues. AmazonBay, the first and largest, came into being when Amazon and eBay merged in 2015, then bought Ask Jeeves a few months later. Over the next few years AmazonBay bought a bank, a credit card company, and an insurance company to increase the services it could offer.   2.  Indosoft  :  Computers woke up in 2043. But revolutionary change in the software business began years earlier as the U.S. giants began to be dominated by their Indian talent. Over time the network of global Indian clans moved their center of action from the U.S. to India. So in 2020, when Microsoft and Oracle merged, it just seemed natural to change the name to Indosoft and move the headquarters to the new Gatestown complex in Mumbai.     3.  Pattelco  :  Communication technologies and the companies that deliver them help shape their eras. The telephone (Bell), television (RCA), the Internet (Cisco), and mobile phones (Nokia) all defined their moments in time. In 2054 the technology that is redefining our lives is telepresence, and the key company is Pattelco.The Indian software giant, originally a software startup of the Patel clan, bought the remnants of AT&T in 2025 and incorporated the long-distance company's initials in its name when it launched the telepresence (TP) industry.                                                         There are only four companies from the current list that figure in the 2054 list and they are IBM,Toyota,News Corp & Nestle .

        Tamil - Part-2                                 Happy Tamil new Year everyone (Iniya Tamizh Puthaandu Nalvaazthukkal)  . Continuing with my yesterday's post , a few more thoughts on the language. Since I studied in CBSE , we had no language subject after 10th Standard and my ties with the language slowly began to wane. Except for the magazines I used to read , I hardly read any serious stuff in the language . I used to read a lot of English Fiction when I was in School & College and it never occured to me at that time that I was missing out a lot by not reading anything in Tamil.                                                         Years later after I started working , I attended a Book fair during one of my Chennai visits.I happened to see Kalki's Ponniyin Selvan at the Book fair and decided to buy it after having heard a lot about it from my Grandmother. That was a turning point. I was hooked to that Novel. Beautifully sketched Characters ( Vandhiya Thevan & Aazhvaarkku Adiyan almost lived with me for a few months after reading the book ! ) & rich vivid imagination marked Kalki's prose . I later bought the entire set of Kalki's collections including Sivagamiyin Sabatham,Paarthiban Kanavu,Kalvanin Kaathali,Thyaga Bhoomi. I also started reading other Tamil humorists like Devan & Saavi. Also later became interested in Poetry and started off with Modern poets like Bharathiar,Kannadasan & Vairamuthu.                                                      The language as it exists today has changed a lot. The Tamil Cinema & Television have competed very well with each other in slowly killing the language ( The TV Tamil is a unique tamil where you get to hear one tamil world after nine english words , Cinema has been responsible for making Chennai slum tamil a standard and making expletives popular to the Nation ). There have been some concerted efforts to save the language but with increased tendency among the urban people to switch over to english , the language faces a lot of Challenge. However some of the best Tamil is spoken abroad at Sri Lanka or Singapore/Malasiya where the spirit is still alive.Let us hope the tamil Language survives the challanges and continues to thrive in the centuries to come.

        Tamil - Part - 1                                  Its strange that you start loving your mother Tongue once you are away from your Hometown. Its been almost 7 years since I have left Madras ( and TN too) . I was reading a post by a friend of mine and thought of writing on this topic.                      I had a wonderful Tamil teacher when I was in 8th Standard ( she continued till 10th standard) . That is when I started falling in love with the Language. We were encouraged by her to read loudly the Tamil Ilakiyam in the class. Tamil Ilakiyam is one heck of a tongue twister ! I became immensly proud of its rich literature ( TholKaappiyam,Thirukural,Iymperum Kappiangal,Aga Naanuru,Pura naanuru,Aathi Choodi,Bharathiar Paadalgal ...the list is endless) .  The deep chasm between spoken Tamil & Tamil Ilakiyam (Sangam & post-sangam era) also provides an interesting and rather sad tale in Sanskritisation ( and now Anglicisation ) of the Language.The Spoken Language is totally different from its Literature.                                                 Alongwith Sanskrit , Tamil is generally acknowledged as one of the Oldest Languages in the world. Tholkaapiyam was supposedly written in the 3rd Century B.C .According to Historians, when the Aryans entered India through the Khyber & Bholan passes, most of the Dravidians were pushed south , a fact corroborated by the fact that the ancient language Brahui (Spoken in Baluchistan ) bears a striking resemblance to Tamil. The ancient Tamils were immensely proud of their language and the Madurai Tamil Conference is a testimony to their efforts to promote the Language.The Kings encouraged the language a lot and numerous stories of poets getting rewarded for their contribution to the language are galore. Thiruvalluvar , Avvaiyaar,Ilango adigal,Kambar,Bharathiar are all tamil poets revered even today for their immeasurable contribution .                                                     Tamil is spoken by around 80 Million people in the world . Apart from India its quite popular in Sri Lanka,Malasiya,Singapore,South Africa,W.Indies and now thanks to the Globalization in US,UK,Canada & Australia.

        How to tell if your boss is happy ?               Found this nice Story.   A little boy went into a drug store, reached for a soda carton and pulled it over to the telephone. He climbed onto the carton so that he could reach the buttons on the phone and proceeded to punch in seven digits.  The store owner  listened to the following conversation.  The boy asked, "Lady, Can you give me the job of cutting your lawn?"  The woman replied, "I already have someone to cut my lawn."  "Lady, I will cut your lawn for half the price of the person who cuts your lawn now."  The woman responded that she was very satisfied with the person who was presently cutting her lawn.    The little boy found more perseverance and offered, "Lady, I'll even sweep your curb and your sidewalk, so on Sunday you will have the prettiest lawn in all of North Palm Beach, Florida."   Again the woman answered in the negative.  With a smile on his face, the little boy replaced the receiver.    The druggist, who was listening to all this, walked over to the boy and said,"Son... I like your attitude, I like that positive spirit and would like to offer you a job."  The little boy replied, "No thanks:) I was just checking on the job I already have!"

        Same Lyrics , Different Tunes                                                   Was listening to the Song "  Chupke Chupke Raat Din  " today morning , when it struck me the Same song had been sung by two different singers in two different tunes. The Jagjit singh's version is much more slower in his patented style but the song sounds wonderful by the Man who made it his signature - the inimitable Ghulam Ali .                                                   Also is the Ghazal "  Babul Mora  " sung by Jagjit and its famous cousin sung by the Idol of all - K.L.Saigal .                              In Tamil the songs which fit this genre are many and most of them are surprisingly Bharathiar songs . Be it "  Manathil Uruthi Vendum  " ( Sung by Yesudas in Sindhu Bhairavi & in the film by the same name ) .  "  Kaakai Sirakinile " - Beautiful composition by L.Vaidyanathan and sung by Yesudas in " Ezhavadhu Manithan" and composed by KVM in ' Thirumaal Perumai'. Other songs include " Nallathor Veenai Seidhu" , " Chinnanchiru Kiliye" & " Theertha Karayinile" .

        The Average Indian Cricket fan                                                       I pity them . The average Indian cricket fan. Their mood swings are extreme ranging from exuberance at India's victory or a Sachin's century to despair and charges of match-fixing whenever we lose badly. The psyche of a fan is pretty much like that of an Indian voter.In the long run nothing stays in his mind and all is forgotten with the eternal hope of optimism.                                                    At my workplace , we have an internal communication forum called " News & Views" . Yesterday found a lot of people cribbing about India's dismal performance and throwing allegations of match-fixing. Amusingly these were the same guys who were on top of the world last week and crowning the Sehwags & Pathans as the best cricketers around.Such swings in mood are nothing new in Indian cricket fans and could be universally found across the cross-section of the country. Stories of cardiac arrests & seizures are common during nail-biting cricket matches . I was a big fan of cricket myself earlier ( Not that crazy anymore)  and hence relate to their feelings.Indians in general are very emotional people and cricket (being a religion here) has seeped deep into their psyche.                                                   At times it has also been strangely associated with patriotism. If you either do not watch cricket or support an opponent , then you are not patriotic ! I remember Bertrand Russel's wonderful quote on Patriotism .    " Patriotism is the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons -- Bertrand Russel "                                                  Cricket is a sport , please do not make it an obsession.

        Pulse Polio Day                                 In co-ordination with UNICEF & Rotary we took part in the Pulse polio drive today. We set-up booths at various sectors in Noida and administered the polio drops to the kids. At the end of the day we had administered Polio drops to around 1,250 kids (most of them from the Slums) . I was part of a Mobile Polio unit and drove all around Noida to most of the slums and administered the drops. We gave free pencils to all the kids which worked as magic. It served as a motivation for most of the kids to take the drops in the Slums. To think that more than 50% of those kids have never been to a school made me really sad. If Noida which is considered to be a affluent suburb of Delhi has 50% illiterate kids in slums then I shudder to think of Rural U.P & Bihar. There is so much that needs to be done at the grassroots level to spread the need for literacy.                                        Once again as the Chariman of the Social Services Committee at my workplace , I learnt a lot during this event. Right from co-ordinating with UNICEF,Rotary, Getting volunteers from our employees , managing these booths, Doing a write-up for our Intranet,Meeting with the Press etc etc...its been one roller-coaster of a management experienece. I also realized community service can be great fun apart from being emotionally satisfying . Gandhiji is perhaps right. India lives in its villages & Slums. If we can educate all these kids at the slums all around the country , we are the Superpower.God bless our country.

        Alternate Careers - Part-2                                                   The story continues..I was in 8th standard when our principal arranged for a 7-day trip to Kanyakumari,Thirunelveli,Kalakkadu & Mundanthurai Wildlife Sanctuaries in Tamil Nadu. The trip cost us just Rs.300 (It was subsidized by the WWF & Forest office). I was mesmerised by the forests & wildlife. We had a great time when a bear started beating our guest house doors after smelling some Bananas & when a leopard jumped right in front of us almost 20 feat ahead when we were marching on the Main Road. A curious friend of mine cited some Agmark ( This guy confused pugmarks with agmark (famous thru Gingely oil ads) and came running to the principal telling them he cited a tiger's agmark to which the principal replied Tigers do not cook food amidst peals of laughter !!) . The forest life was fascinating with early morning baths in the river , Treks,wildlife & bird-watching , Camp fires etc. It was a whole new world and needless to say most of us fell in love with it. The forest ranger regaled us with incredible animal stories and that started a fascination in me to become a Forest ranger . I had vaguely heard about Jim Corbett back then and immediately after the trip was over , I was reading all his books and deriving inspiration. That my uncle was very closely involved in Wildlife Conservation also triggered a passion.                                                  Now on reflection I realize the problem with pursuing dreams in India are fear of financial insecurity & the society. A Tam-Bram either has to be a Engineer (Preferably Comp.Sci ) or a Chartered Accountant .Its unthinkable to think of anything otherwise. The fascination continued with wildlife but it became a hobby instead of a career. Though I remain still very passionate about it (the interest having translated to Occasional visits to Sanctuaries,Reading books on Animal Kingdom,watching National Geographic/Discovery/Animal Planet, Building a collection of NGC Multimedia CD-ROMs ) , at best my knowledge could be termed half-baked and I will never remain a professional conservationist.

        Okhla Bird Sanctuary                                        It all started yesterday evening during the Dinner. Was having dinner with a few friends at the office and then the conversation veered towards Wildlife/Bird-watching & Travel. A friend (Shouvik) of mine mentioned about the Okhla Bird Sanctuary situated right below the Delhi-Noida DND Flyover and we decided to explore it . I had heard of it through my BNHS (Bombay Natural History Society) newsgroups .                                       Today morning armed with Nikon Camera,Binocs we started at 5am for the Sanctuary. It was such a non-descript place with hardly any people . We had to search and travel across kutcha roads before finding a small board proclaiming " Welcome to Okhla Bird Sanctuary" . The sunrise was beautiful amidst the tall grasses and we spotted a lot of water birds like Cormorants,Partridges,White Herons,Ducks,Egrets. The Salim Ali's Book of Indian Birds was a great help in spotting the birds.We were the only two people there and spent more than two hours photographing & sighting birds.                                        Unfortunately the place is heavily polluted with Plastics & garbage. People travel all the way here and dump the garbage in the water which is very sad. Hope the Govt declares the place as a protected site and prohibits trespassers.

        Is my sleep worth Rs.400 ?                               I have come Casual Leaves(CL's) which are going to expire soon.Its been 4+ years since I have left Mumbai and hence thought of paying a visit to Mumbai to meet up my friends/relatives. All Trains/All classes are badly wait-listed for the next 3 weeks to Mumbai . Air India flights are a cheaper option from Delhi-Mumbai . The day flights offer 25% discount and the night flights 32.5% discount. Taking a night flight almost spoils one's entire night since the flights are scheduled close to midnight. The difference between a day flight and a night flight is Rs.400.That brings  me to my title " Does AI think my night sleep is worth Rs.400 ? " :-)

        What do I do ?  - A perspective                          I go to work at 2pm.I arrive back from work at Midnight.I get Dropped at home by a Qualis.So I should be working for a Call centre ! This is a popular conclusion most of my neighbors have drawn about me.All my efforts of explaining to them what I do have been met with more stranger Questions and a sense of incomprehension of IT Industry.When I tell them I work in the Storage & Enterprise Backup Team Supporting a Data Center,their understanding is further confounded.                         I find it strange to keep an alarm to wake up at 8am.I see the Sunrise only during my trips on the weekends.I talk to my friends more through email/chat than through Phone.I eat food when I have time rather than when I should be.I have my Dinner at 11pm.I interact with more Americans than Indians at workplace.                         In short , I am a victim of the Outsourcing Wave which has swept numerous Indians like me off their normal life.

        Hits & Misses                   The Drama is unfolding. The new ministers have been announced and the tantrums & power grabbing games have already begun.While Some Talented,erudite men like P.Chidambaram,Pranab Mukherjee,Kapil Sibal have been rewarded with cabinet posts , its rather surprising that none of the congress youth Brigade figures in the list (Not even as Ministers of State) .Talented young men like Jyotiraditya Scindia,Sachin Pilot,Milind Deora,Sandeep Dikshit,Jairam Ramesh (Not that young) have been overlooked. Congress has stuck to its policy of rewarding loyalty more than talent ( or a move to appease the power hungry old horses).

        DELHI-DHARAMSALA-MCLEODGANJ-DALHOUSIE-KHAJJIAR-DELHI                         The Summer heat of Delhi drove us this weekend to the Hills.I had wanted to visit Dharamsala for a long time(attracted by its Buddhist influence).Six of us set off in a Scorpio.    DHARAMSALA  : Dharamsala is around 500 kms from Delhi and is situated in Himachal Pradesh.Dharamsala is around 1800m above sea level and gained prominence during the late 50's when Dalai Lama made it his place of Stay.Its a quaint little town with a few Tea Gardens and an art museum.    MCLEODGANJ  : We headed directly to Mcleodganj.Mcleodganj is named after David Mcleod,the Lt.Governer of Punjab.Its located 10 kms above Dharamsala.Mcleodganj houses the Residence of Dalai Lama & the Buddhist monastery. My first impression of the place was " This is not India " . Almost 60% of people we met were foreigners and the place is like a mini Tibet with most of Dalai Lama's followers settling down there.It has a rather crowded market place and finding accommodation during summers was a little tough.We Stayed farther up (almost 2 kms away) at Hotel Triund. The monastery is a modest complex consisting of the Karmachakra Temple,Buddha Statue,Residence of Dalai Lama & a Tibetian Museum.The Tibetiam Museum depicts the horror of Chinese invasion on Tibet and the massacre of millions of innocent Tibetians.We tried to seek an audience with the Dalai Lama but were politely turned down.The Karmachakra temple is a testimony to the evolution of Buddhism from Hinduism bearing close resemblance to the ancient hindu temples. We then drove down to Dal Lake ( which resembled more like a muddy swimming pool in the summer) and to Nandoo a point from where we had terrific views of the Dhauladhar Mountain range.We retired back to the Hotel in anticipation of the 13km Trek to Triund-Ilaqa which we had planned for the next day.    DALHOUSIE  : However the sunday morning turned out to be rainy at Mcleoganj and hence we dropped our trek plans and instead headed to Dalhousie.Dalhousie is located 120 kms to the North west of Dharamsala.We reached there by afternoon.It was a beautiful Hill station with fewer crowd and tall pine trees and cool weather. We had lunch at Dalhousie Market and started for Khajjiar.    KHAJJIAR  : Khajjiar is located 22 Kms from Dalhousie.Its not for nothing they call it the "Switzerland of India".We were welcomed by a lush 1km by 1km meadow with a pond in the middle and pine trees all around.It was a marvelous sight and was worth the long travel we had undertaken.We trekked through the pine trees and wandered through the woods and spent a couple of hours there. It suddenly started raining and the place seemed absolutely romantic with raindrops falling on the green meadow.We started back to Delhi and after an exhausting 14 hours drive finally reached Delhi by Monday afternoon.    TRAVEL TIPS  : The Summer is perhaps when most people travel to the Hills.I would say Dalhousie is a better choice than Dharamsala.If you are religious or are fascinated by Buddhism (Like I was), then Dharamsala would be a great place to visit .Travel by Train till Pathankot and grab a bus/taxi from there to Dalhousie (80 kms).    AFTERTHOUGHTS  : Though the trip was hectic (we traveled around 2000 kms in 3 days!) , we enjoyed it thoroughly.Great gang of friends made the Trip memorable (Most of the friends this time were from IIM-L,S.P.Jain , so it was great leg-pulling and Gyaans & Fundas all the way !).

        Change in Plans                    Due to a last minute change in the Plan , We went to Dharamsala-Mcleodganj-Dalhousie-Khajjiar instead of Gangotri.It was a rather hectic but enjoyable trip.

        Promising weekend                      The weekend looks promising.I am off to Gangotri this time. We would also be trekking 18 kms from Gangotri to the Gomukh Ice Cave from where the Ganges Originates.Looks exciting. More on it when I come back on Monday .

        The game has just begun ..                          Everyone who is someone wants to be " THE ONE" .Laloo wants DPM & Home Ministry,Karunanidhi wouldn't mind becoming DPM, Sharad Pawar wants DPM and/or Defense.Pranab Mukerjee doesn't want Finance but will settle for nothing less than home.JMM wants the coal. Dayanidhi Maran is gunning for Industries portfolio.Paswan wants communication.RJD wants Railways.                       I feel sorry for Manmohan Singh. He has a tough job in hand with so many demanding allies (most of whom are utterly incompetent to make matters worse).Manmohan would be better served if he does a crash course on handling allies from his former boss P.V.Narasimha Rao , who was an expert at it.                        The act of cleansing politics is a slow process which might take decades to happen but I hope it happens one day .

        Too Good to be True                         I logged on to my GMAIL Account.What I saw flabbergasted me.It said " You are currently using 0MB of your 1000000 MB" .Whew ! I thought. Has Google started offering 1 TB of Mailbox size ? I couldn't believe my eyes.It was too good to be true.Did a quick googling.Realized it was a Glitch(bug) and google was trying to fix it.I know a GB is much more than you can ask for but then is there an end to human greed ?

        The Sky is Clear                      India is really Shining !! Its a proud day for India.Not because a foreign born person could not become the PM of India.But because the two top posts of the Country (PM & President) are being Occupied by Men of Great Repute,Honesty,Integrity.The President of my Country is a Ph.D Holder and a Scientist with a deep concern for Children & the poor. A man of unbelievable Simplicity and someone who has dedicated his life to Science.                     My Prime Minister is a Ph.D Holder too and an economist of international repute.The father of Indian economic liberlization and an eminent professor . A man who enjoys respect across party lines. That both of them are non-Hindus in a Supposed to be Hindu Nationalist Country is an event of sheer coincidence & a fact that hardly matters to Indians.                   This is the best news we can give to the world.We are a Country of Values & immense respect for Education.Education is our path to Super-powerdom and Salvation from misery.Look no yonder but at our PM & President as a testimony to it (Both being Doctrates)! Jai Hind !

        Work Can be Cruel                      It is 5.30 am and am Still in the office. Been here since the last 20 Hours,a routine which has become common over the last few weeks.Our Team is overburdened with work and we have been trying our best to finish it.                       I suddenly feel like a Alien.Its been several weeks since I have seen TV/Listened to Music/Read a Book ( A routine so normal to me until a few weeks ago when I used to listen to at least two Cassettes/CD's a day and read a Book a day ).Work is like Season.It comes in Cycles.

        Spurs Choke again                      The Lakers have done it again.After being 0-2 down in the NBA Western Conference Semi-finals , they have come back to beat San Antonio Spurs 4-2.I hate to see the Spurs losing but Lakers this year have an awesome roaster of Players (Shaq,Kobe,Gary Payton,Karl Malone,Derek Fischer). It looks more like a Dream Team. Alongwith the NY Yankees,the LA Lakers symbolise the enduring Sporting Legacy of Wonderful Players,Loyal fans & unlimited fame.                      The Western Conference Winners have for the last few Years been the winners of NBA Title too ( The Western Teams are so very superior to the East that the Semi-final loser in the West can beat the best East Team !).So the Shaq-Kobe Domination continues in-spite of On-field Rivalry & off-field Legal Battles(Kobe).

        A few Good Men                    With the Congress set to form the next Govt there has been a lot of doubts on the Continuance & pace of economic Reforms.Many have forgotten that it was the Congress which started the economic liberalisation in 1991 ( Who can forget the Trio of Manmohan Singh-P.Chidambaram-Montek Singh Ahluwalia).                      The Current Team looks even much better with Manmohan Singh-P.Chidambaram-Pranab Mukherjee-Jairam Ramesh (Who Amongst themselves are Alumni of Distinguished Schools like IIT,Harvard,Carnegie-Melon,MIT,Oxford !).Seems the Economic liberalisation would continue but would be "reforms with a Human face".Its also equally important that we get a very good HRD Minister(Primary School Education should be a key focus) , Agriculture Minister(Rural India needs to shine)and a pro-active External Affairs Minister.The next few days are going to be exciting and let us hope for the best.

        New Look               Blogger has come up with a lot of cool Templates.Was fiddling around and chose this one.Most of my Customizations have been lost and got to work on it tomorrow and get them back (With my Half baked knowledge of codes its going to be a tough climb ! ).

        Election Results                     The people have finally spoken out.They have proved all the exit polls wrong and have ushered back an era of Gandhian Dynasty ( Shouldn't it be called Nehruvian Dynasty ?).The India Shining more than helping the BJP I guess created a backlash among the 80% electorate for whom it was not shining.Water,Electricity,Good Raods,Food became bigger issues than FDI,Global Back office and Indo-Pak Cricket.Also Local issues like Telengana,Amma's tiff with Govt employees,powerful alliances by Congress worked against the NDA.                                     Congress too has some bright faces in Manmohan Singh,P.Chidambaram,Natwar Singh,Pranab Mukherjee not to forget young stalwarts like Jyotiraditya Scindia,Sachin Pilot,Milind Deora.The Biggest concern would be the Left being part of the govt and hindering/slowing down the economic reforms process.The valuable lesson to be learnt at the end of the day is do not ignore the Rural common man.Only if Rural India shines , the Real India will shine.

        Indian Politico Speak                         The Netas have Hijacked the Media . Be it Print or Television you find them everywhere spewing out Jargons. We repeatedly keep hearing words like "Secular" , "Anti-incumbency" , " High Command" , " Political Swing" etc thrown at us. Here is a little humorous piece on what Politicians speak & what they mean :   1. Secular Front -- Whovever supports me is Secular and whoever opposes me is unsecular .   2. Anti-Incumbency -- An high profile word used to blame one's defeat due to non-performance.   3. High Command -- (Particularly in Congress) Means Sonia Gandhi. When a Congressman says the Congress High Command will make a decision he means he is awaiting Sonia's words .   4. Political Swing -- A Geographical phenomenon created by Bogus voting,Booth-capturing and bribing the voters .   5. Stability -- An agreement to be fooled for a long period of time between the Parties and the Voters.    6. India is Shining -- The Urban areas are full of BPO's,Malls fully lit even during night whereas Rural India is languishing in Dark.   7. We will Cross the Bridge when it comes -- We will indulge in Horse Trading after the results are announced.   8. Post Poll Alliance -- I am ready to fall at anyone's feet for power.   9. In the Nation's interest -- In my personal/party's interests .....  10. Jai Hind -- God save the Country

        Hectic Work                  I am amazed that I have been able to blog regularly the last two weeks because work has been quite hectic for me at office.I am spending an average of 80 Hours a week at work ( Its crazy , I feel like a Lawyer from one of those Grisham's Novels !) since we have some tight deadlines to catch ( At work, we are always fighting against unrealistic deadlines).                       My personal life has gone for a toss since I am at work from 9 am to midnight almost every day .

        F1 - Watched my first Race                        My Knowledge of F1 (Formula One)is almost close to zero. However , I do have a lot of friends who are crazy about F1.Vijai, a friend of me invited me to watch the Spanish Grand Prix at a Pub on Full Screen . Though I haven't watched much F1 , I have played a lot of Motor Racing games on Sony PS-2 and hence found the race to be extremely interesting yesterday.It was Schumi again and a 1-2 for Ferrari .                             Found F1 to be a pretty interesting sport and intend to follow it much more closely in the future.

        Politicians - Up Close                                  I was at the NDTV last weekend for  " We the People" program. Got to see our Netas fighting it out over the mikes. No one arrived on time. Amar Singh arrived 45 minutes late and had the audacity to ask " Main tho chota aadmi hun , main aa gaya , aur log kidar hai ? ( Isn't false modesty a big vice in Urban India ? ) The Topic was " Has Brand Atal lost its sheen ? " . But the discussion meandered so far away from the topic , I was wondering how many politicians would get selected in a B-school GD if they attend one !                                          The most misused word in Indian politics is "Secular" . Congress projected the secular card and called all NDA Constituents non-secular . ( ADMK which is in NDA suddenly becomes unsecular because it has aligned with BJP , whereas when they were earlier with the congress they were secular ) . In the next elections when they join back with Congress they would become secular again. Does the Congress think its like Ganges , whoever dips in them becomes pure and Secular ( What crap ! ) . Why are the politicians fooling the poor minorities?                                          Politics is all about Money & power. Where are the ideals ? What Happened to great politicians like Kamaraj,Lal Bahadur Sastri ( The former a king maker and the latter resigned for a train accident) . Except for a few,  the others won't resign even if sent to prison. Good people should not shy away from politics , because on politics rests our country's future.

        Elections - The great Indian Tamasha                                       In a week's time the elections results would be out and that would end weeks of Tamasha . As the world's largest democracy , we also have the most festive/colorful elections in the world. From Glitzy filmstars to flamboyant businessmen to Criminals behind the bars to seasoned politicians to dynasty progenies to underworld dons to sportspersons -- you name it and they are there in the fray .                                                                    Sorry to sound cliched , but most of our politicians are hopeless . Once in a Blue Moon you find a Abdul Kalaam / Arun Shourie / A.K.Antony / Manmohan singh . Its a bane of the country that good / educated people rarely enter politics ( Not that literates make good politicians ..There have been numerous exceptions like Kamaraj ) , but at least there should be a minimum bar set . Accusations , sleazy songs , mud-slinging are all part of the election process.                                          Non-issues become issues. Onion prices & sugar prices which fluctuated just before the elections( Onions last time , sugar this time) became major issues pushing down factors like Development & unemployment. Mandir & Masjid are still issues and in TN since there have been good rains since last week , Jayalalitha is being hailed as a Rain God ( The funda is that ADMK symbol is two leaves which needs/promotes Rain , whereas DMK's symbol is Sun which wards off the Rain ! -- fundoo logic ) .                                        Everyone talks of a 10% growth and superpowerdom in 2020 , but no one wants to make an effort to clean the political rot . When a bill was hoping to be passed in parliament last year banning criminals from contesting elections , all the parties opposed it . Indian electorate is also stoic and believes its in their destiny to have such politicians .                                    Probably the biggest hindrance for our future growth is our politics . Unless we make a conscious effort to reform it , we would like a slimy earthworm climbing a wall. For very two steps forward we take , we would fall back by a step. God bless India !

        Van Gogh - The Irony of a Genius                                 Read this harmless piece of news yesterday " Picasso's 1905 Masterpiece  Garcon a la pipe   set a new world record when it was auctioned for $104 million overtaking the previous record of Vincent Van Gogh whose Portrait of  Dr.Gachet  sold for $82.5 million a few years back " .                                                                I love reading Biographies & Autobiographies. One of the best biographies I have read has been the Biography of Vincent Van Gogh. Hailed today as one of the Greatest painters , his life was a tragic one. Here are some glimpses from his life :   1. With No one to support him except his Brother (towards the end of his life ) he was a loner most of his life.   2. Cuts off his ear in disgust after a Fallout with a fellow painter .   3. Gets admitted to a mental asylum since the locals consider him a madman.   4. Sold his only painting during his lifetime, for 400 francs.   5. Shoots himself , takes 2 days to die, alone in his little bedroom.  (at the age of 37)                                                               Could there be more irony than someone's painting selling for 82 million dollars when all he got during his lifetime was just 400 Francs ! Life is strange , ironical and sometimes cruel .

        IITans - A perspective                                                    Reading the book IITans set my thoughts rolling about my IIT friends and roommates. During my School/college  days lots of IITans were part of the QFI (Quiz Foundation of India ) of which I was a member of. Incredibly talented guys.                             I have had lots of  IITans as room-mates and close firends too . Its very difficult to categorize them. My earlier roommate ( an IITan) left his job after calling his manager stupid and slapping him .                                   But if there is one Character that is common to all of them , then its self-belief . There were three of us who were very close friends at my earlier company. Except me the other two were from IITs. We used to spend hours and hours talking about everything under the sun and I was always amazed by their perspective towards life which stemmed from a very high self-belief. If there is something the world ought to learn from them then its definitely this.

        IITans                 Just finished reading the book " IITans" over the weekend . I was lucky to grab a copy autographed by Sandipan Deb ( The author of the book , Alumnus of IIT-Kgp,IIM-C) from a friend. The book talks about the incredible institution that IIT's are and discusses among other things how IIT's were formed,Successful IITans,The future for IIT's,The college culture (Midnight puri parties,ragging,inter-hostel rivalry),Absence of research and the Characteristics of IITans.                             Sandipan has a very light,lucid style of writing which makes an interesting read. The Book covers a wide canvass and the author has tried to do justice to them all . Though some familiar names like Vinod Khosla,Vinod Gupta,Rajat Gupta,Nandan Nilekani keep cropping up throughout the book the author does have some interesting obscure IITans profiled.                                  Most of us would have had IIT Dreams during our childhood and some of us never made it to those meccas of Techincal education . Probably there is a tinge of regret one might feel after reading this book , wishing one had put in a little more effort during those school days ( To have entered IIT ! ) . Its indeed a marvel that a nation which has millions of illiterate people has churned out the most brilliant minds in technology too .

        Nanganallur has changed                           This was perhaps a big surprise.As I drove my two-wheeler down the Subway,I was mentally prepared to negotiate the bad roads.But surprisingly all the raods had been relaid (Thanks to the elections) and looked great.Nanganallur(a suburb of Chennai) is where I spent a little more than 10 years and most of my school/college life.It is famous for two things - Temples & Bad roads.Its a wonderful well-knit community of religious people (mostly middle class & upper middle class) with a flair for education and fine arts.                                        So much has changed.There are so many ATM's abound (I remember the good old days when I used to bicycle to the market and stand in a Queue in the Bank to withdraw/deposit money) and retailers like Foodworld & Subiksha.Thanks to the famous 32-feet Anjaneyar (Hanuman) temple and a host of other temples, it has become a mini pilgrimage centre.                                      Things have changed from personal front too.I used to visit my Thatha & paati (Grandfather & grandmother) everytime I visit Chennai.Now that house wears a  deserted look.My grandmother lives alone there (Grandpa expired a few months ago) .That house is a testimony to my Thatha's hardwork and love and he never left that place during his stay of 20 years there.He was the house and the house was him.Now only his photos adorn the wall.Time is cruel sometimes.Because you can't rewind it at your will.

        MBA - Climbing the first steps...                  Spent most of Yesterday & today in deciding what subjects to take during my first trimester of MBA.The Subject selection has to be made online and after much research have decided to take up Financial Management,Economic Analysis,Financial Accounting,Marketing Management,e-commerce & IT (I can take upto 5 subjects and decided to take these 5 core subjects).                                I would be going back to Full-time School (or as we call it college in India) after almost 7 years.Barring the IT Certifications which I have done in the last few years, haven't done much of hard-core studies.So its going to be an exciting future.B-Schools guys , any expert inputs would be appreciated (Afterall isn't the essence of MBA giving Gyaans & fundas :-) )

        John Lennon - Beatles                 Perhaps to most people the name conjures with a persona next to god (Is that why John Lennon infamously commented at the peak of Beatlemania in 1965 that " I think we (Beatles) are more popular than Jesus Christ " ? ). I was at the BCL (British Council Library , Chennai) and was fascinated by a Photo-book on Lennon which I promptly borrowed.The Book contains more than 500 Spectacular photographs of John Lennon & the Beatles ( All in B&W which makes it more appealing).The Photographs are Outstanding with texts inter-spread about John Lennon. There are some rare photos like the Beatles with Muhammad Ali (Cassius Clay then) proclaiming " We are the best" & Beatles upclose during their concerts & picnics.                  The book also traces the rise of Beatles,the ensuing mania,the dope culture,the break-up of Beatles,their quest for spirituality in India,John's controversial marriage to Yoko Ono,the long hair culture,his role as an ambassador of peace and his untimely death at the hands of a mad fan.                  John was shot dead when he was just 40 but his music & legacy continue to mesmerize the world.For all his controversies,we can't deny his importance either in the world of music or as a prominent figure of the 20th century.

        Tamil vs Hindi                   "Its slowly changing now"."There are even a couple of theatres which screen hindi movies".The above Conversation happened at the Delhi Airport between two middle aged ladies speaking Hindi.I didn't have to be a genius to figure out that they were talking about Madras.             After having lived outside Madras for 7+ years in various cities, I have found that Madras still remains an enigma for most North-Indians.Apart from the usual debate of Hindi Vs Tamil ( Which I have seen is an emotional issue to both sides),Madras represents an almost foreign city like feeling for most northies.I have seen Hindi Speakers abusing Tams of being an isolated community by not joining the mainstream Bharat by speaking Hindi ( Though the truth is that majority of the population are not averse to hindi and its just the politicians who have made it an issue & numerous southies have learnt hindi reasonably well at Hindi prachar Sabhas/Central Schools or eager to learn at workplace). Tams are angry at Hindi speaking crowd for imposition of Hindi (Which is equally stupid since Hindi is the national language and we need to learn it and helps us in communicating with the majority of fellow nationals) & belittling tamil.             Come to Madras.You will be surprised to hear so much hindi on the roads. There is a big North Indian population thriving in the Madras metropolis not just in the last few years but for decades.Scores of Hindi movies run here.I could not get a ticket to a Ghazal concert during my last visit at Chennai since it was full.People perhaps don't respond to hindi queries out of ignoranace and not out of discrimination.Come on .Let us wake up.As we move forward, we don't need these internal squabbles to unsettle us.The greatness of India is its diversity.Let us respect it and turn it to our advantage.

        Moving on ....                 Its time to move on." All the world is a Stage and men and women are mere players" .Change is perhaps the only thing which is constant and I am ready to move on to the next city . Today is my last day with CSC (Computer Sciences Corporation).I am leaving CSC to pursue a full time MBA at Singapore.I would be in Madras (my home town) for the next 3 weeks and would be leaving for S'pore by early July.                CSC had been a great place to work.Although the company is Huge (With a Annual Revenue of US$14 Billion - Its almost 15 times as big as Infy/Wipro),it maintains a low profile in India (Though things have slowly changed in the recent past).It has truly been a listening organization and has some wonderful HR practices in place.The freedom it gave me to pursue Social work is commendable.Perhaps, the biggest regret I will have is that as Chairman of our Social services Committee , I won't be around to ensure continuity of the community projects that we had started.                   So , its goodbye to CSC Today and goodbye to Delhi tomorrow.

        Mumbai              I am back in Delhi after meeting my Relatives & friends in Mumbai . " City of Dreams" , " City that never Sleeps" the epithets are abound about Mumbai and the city perhaps deserves most of it.Despite the crowds,the Infrastructure & vibrancy of the city amazes you.                                                It was great to meet most of my old friends after such a long time.The weather was great with mild rains and I made the most of my stay by traveling on the Local Trains and the BEST buses.Whatever people might say , this city bristles with life.

        AMAR CHITRA KATHA & TINKLE                  I was lucky to view a Program titled " Business Bizarre" on BBC Yesterday night at 10pm.The Program was on the Evolution of the " Amar Chitra Katha " since the day of its inception,its unqualified success in the 70's & 80's and the business challenges it faced in the 90's and today.It was the Dream of one man " Anant Pai" (I knew him more by his tamil pen name Vaandu mama).                      For someone who grew on a diet of Amar Chitra Katha & Tinkle (I was so crazy about them that I still have all the books stored in two big suitcases at my home in Madras !), the program was a trip in Nostalgia and an eye-opener to its current Challenges.The Characters of Kapish,Kalia the crow,Suppandi are forever etched in your memories with those evergreen stories.Most of us would have learnt our Ramayan,Mahabharat,Indian History from those vivid colorful cartoons and concise texts.                       The Program talked about the unqualified success of Amar Chitra Katha ( It sold a record Half a million copies per month in the 80's ) in the 70's & 80's and how the circulation went downhill with the advent of Color Television in the late 80's and early 90's.The Economic Liberlisation heralded the advent of Cartoon Network TV Channel & foreign comic books which further resulted in a steep decline.Now the magazine sells just 85000 copies a month and has stopped printing in languages other than English & Hindi ( Though some local publishers still print a small number of copies in local languages).The Program made an interesting business case study however what gushed inside me was pure nostalgia !

        Doctors & Handwriting                         The aftereffects of the Gangotri Trip have been disastrous. I have been suffering from food poisoning ( Thanks to the Dhabas)for the last few days.Decided to visit the In-House Doctor who visits my office in the evenings.I started by telling him how I got sick and the Conversation veered more towards my travel pursuits rather than my sickness.                          He prescribed some medicines to me. I don't know what is it that is between Doctors & Bad Handwriting . Do they include it as an elective in all Medical colleges ? ( on the Converse,do all pharmacists attend a course on how to decipher illegible handwriting ? ).                     It reminded me of One of Vivek's (Tamil Comedian) movies.Vivek is a first year Medical Student in the movie.Sorry Non-Tam Guys. The following conversation is in Tamil.   Other person : Coughs  Vivek : Ennada Irumbara . Udambu Seri Illaya ? Naan Konjum Mathare Ezhudi Tharen .  Other person : Enna Ayya Ezhudhinadhu Onnume puriyalaye ?  Vivek : Dai Doctor-na Ezhudinadhu puriya Koodathuda. Vicks-a thaan appadi surukki surkki ezhudhinen !

        DELHI - UTTARKASHI - GANGOTRI - GOMUKH                             In the hinterlands of the Himalayas is Gangotri where, it is believed, Ganga, the stream of life, touched earth for the first time. At the legendary source of the river, Goddess Ganga is worshipped in the form of deity. Gomukh, the identified source of the river Ganga, is 18 kms further uphill. The trek to Gomukh is gradual, and several pilgrims undertake the journey to pay homage to the river at its known source.                    This is what a website claimed and we set off on a ambitious trip to see the Originating point of River Ganges .Gangotri is 500 Kms from Delhi ( 250 kms to Rishikesh + 150 kms to Uttarkashi + 100 Kms to Gangotri).Since it was a long weekend ( Memorial Day in the US and hence a holiday for me here in India !), we set off on Friday evening in two Tata Indicas.The night drive turned out to be a very exhausting one and we halted at Rishikesh & Uttarkashi before finally reaching Gangotri by Saturday afternoon.The Drive from Rishikesh to Uttarkashi and from Uttarkashi to Gangotri is absolutely beautiful with deep valleys and the river ganges flowing parallel to the steep,curvy roads.                        We Checked in at the GMVN Guest House ( State owned , a rather decent one but with unfriendly rude staff).We visited the Gangamaa temple which was a 0.5 km trek from the Hotel.Its a rather small temple built for goddess ganga where the deity is revered by the locals and the harathi in the evening is a crowded festive occasion.The temple has a small market place with a lot of Dhabas & shops selling religious merchandise.                           We headed back early to the hotel in anticipation of the big day ahead of us.The next day we had planned to do the 18 Km Trek ( 36 Kms both ways) from Gangotri to Gomukh Glacier ( The icy cave where Ganges actually originates).On retrospection , I feel at that moment we had not fully comprehended the arduous journey , a blunder I would regret the next day. We Started at 6.30 am . The Trail starts right behind the Gangamaa temple . The initial 1 km is very steep ( Probably a marketing strategy to make people feel weary so that they take the ponies waiting at the end of the stretch).The trek gets slightly even after that although it is still quite steep intermittently. At the end of 10 kms we were thoroughly exhausted and some how managed to drag ourselves near Gomukh.I was totally exhausted and fell on top of a rock and slept on it for almost an hour towards the end of the 18km trek.Gomukh is a icy cave where the crystal clear blue waters of Ganga originate.The view of the Mountains is stupendous and the icy winds try to blow you off your feet.For a moment, you forget all the agony.                          We rested for a while and started the trek back to Gangotri.We were totally exhausted and some even fell down unable to move an inch further.Somehow I miraculously dragged myself back through the 18 kms and when I fell on the bed I realized that I had 206 bones and that my leg had become a  persona non grata  in my body. On the Hindsight it was foolish of us to have attempted to do 40 Kms of steep trek in a day but since we were pressed for time we didn't have much choice.                          We started for Uttarkashi the next day morning.The Viswanath temple at Uttarkashi is a very auspicious temple and has a nice facade on a crowded,dusty market place.The temple is a scenic place amidst the tall mountain ranges which encompass it.We returned to Delhi well past midnight and were glad to be back home after a grueling trip.But now at the end of it,all the pain has vanished with wonderful memories of Ganga and the scenic valley.    TRAVEL TIPS :  The Best time to travel to Gangotri is during the Summer. Uttarkashi is the nearest connecting hub for all the Char Dhams(Gangotri,Yamunotri,Badrinath,Kedarnath).The best way to trek from Gangotri to Gomukh is to take a halt at the GMVN guest house at Bhojbasa ( Which is 4 kms before Gomukh on the trail)and continue the trek the next day.Hard core trekers could even continue till Tapovan which is 7 kms from Gomukh.The food and water is very expensive on the way ( We paid Rs.30 for 10 rupee Kinley bottle at Bhojbasa) and hence be prepared for that.Never eat much on the day of trek and carry plenty of medicines with you. The icy winds are very powerful and hence wear thick woollen wear and overcoats.More than anything , cultivate an habit of regular walking before trying anything as ambitious as this.

         MBA - Best way to Learn ?      &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the first thing that strikes you at B-school is the way it questions your traditional methods of learning.Most of us have been used to a system of Teacher-Student Instruction method where the teacher lectures and the student learns.     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at my B-school there is a heavy emphasis on Case Study Method and Group Presentations.This brings us to the age old debate of which is better : Case Study Vs Lecture Method. There is no prefect answer for this. Some Schools like Harvard,Darden (U of Virginia) follow predominantly the Case Study Method , while others like Yale,Carnegie-Mellon follow the Lecture Method.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I have no clue which is the best method.But found this  urlLink URL  about the teaching styles in Top 25 US B-Schools.

         IIM - A Bit Too Late      &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It just happened a bit too late. I had called my Mom yesterday.She told me&nbsp;" Hey , There is an interview letter which has come for you from IIM- Indore" . It caught me by surprise. After not getting any Interview Calls from IIM early this year , I had decided to pursue an MBA Abroad and had joined Nanyang Business School at Singapore ( One of the Top 3 in ASEAN and among the Top 10 in Asia).     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had happily settled into my B-school life when I received this news yesterday.Since I haven't seen the Interview letter yet, I suspect this is an interview call for the Part-time MBA at Indore . But What matters is CSC (Computer Sciences Corp) India , the company I used to work for earlier is Headquartered at Indore (Which would have&nbsp;given me a better leverage in pursuing a FT/PT MBA).Perhaps , its too late now .Having left my job and having come abroad , there is no looking back.There are no If's & but's in life but on retrospection I wish this call had come a couple of months earlier.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at least now I will have the satisfaction of saying " u know I got an Admit in IIM's , but didn't take it :-) "

         Filmi Connections     &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Filmi connections always fascinate.We have always had this once in a while filmi neighbours (Rambha , Bindu Gosh used to be next door neighbours at T.Nagar) . However at our new apartment in Chennai my next door neighbour is Susi Ganesan (former assistant of Maniratnam &amp; Tamil Film Director who directed Five Star &amp; Virumbugiren) and on my Upper floor is Kunal (The Hero of Kaadhalar Dhinam). Though I do not know Kunal very well , Susi Ganesan is a very good friend.Being a film junkie myself , I discuss a lot about films with him .   &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had invited me out for Dinner just before I left for Singapore . We discussed the screenplay of his upcoming movies and he was quite forthcoming in sharing the ideas with me. He also shares the insider titbits on the working of the film industry and its always interesting to listen.I have this secret dream of making at least&nbsp;a documentary film in my life&nbsp; &nbsp; and those thoughts always get stirred when I talk to him.Who knows I might do it one day ....

Its the same throughout the year.The temperature varies from 25c to 35c all through the year.There is no winter , no hot summer . Its warm, humid with inter-mittent rains all round the year.Rains are unpredictable and of short spells (reminds me of Seattle,US).    &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So no sweaters or overcoats in S'pore.Just normal clothes would do.That is a nice welcome from the damn Delhi weather (Dai Venky , I know you will disagree with me ). &nbsp;

        Time to Kill - Hitchcock,Pyaasa,John Grisham                       My medical test results are coming only on Friday (I can proceed with my immigration only after this) and hence had a lot of time to kill yesterday & today.Most of which was spent on reading the latest John Grisham novels - The Summons & King of Torts.Also read the Autobiography of David Ogilvy and few Travel books on Singapore & South east Asia.                    My uncle has a great collection of movies.Saw Alfred Hitchcock's "Rope" day before yesterday.Saw Guru Dutt's " Pyaasa" yesterday.   PYAASA :  What a movie ! Dark,poignant and mesmerising like his personal life "Pyaasa" is an immortal classic and one of my favourite movies.The heart-wreching story of a young,poor poet "Pyaasa" is Guru dutt's whip to the Social Hypocrisy that exists in Indian society.Waheeda Rehman is ravishing and Johnny walker plays a commendable cameo role.The pulse of the movie is its immortal lyrics by Sahir and music by S.D.Burman.Be it the Chirpy " Jaane Kya Tune" or the funny " Sar Jo Tera" or the haunting " Jaane Woh Kaise" , " Yeh Duniya agar" Dada Burman reigns Supreme.The Vocals of Mohd.Rafi,Geeta Dutt and Hemantda ( Jaane Woh kaise - What wonderful singing) add great value to the music.                   But the film belongs to Guru Dutt , the director and Sahir , the Lyricist.The narrative style is excellent and perhaps way ahead of its times.Sahir has poured his heart with lyrics like " Jinhe Naaz hai hind par woh Kahaan" , " Humne tho jab kaliyan maangi thi kaaton ka haar mila" , " yeh duniya agar mil bhi tho kya hai" . The movie is a Classic and easily rates as one of the top ten Hindi movies of all times.

        Library,College etc..                           The biggest humbling experience for me is visiting a library.It reinforces my commitment to the tamil proverb " Katradhu Kaimannalavu , kallaadadhu ulagaalavu (Whatever you know is like the sand in your palm, whatever you do not know is the sand around the globe).As a bibliophile,the Singapore National library looks to become my best friend.The National Library at Singapore was Huge with books on every conceivable topic on the planet.Took a few books (Including one on David Ogilvy - A person I admire a lot) and learnt the tips & tricks of commuting by Singapore MRT(Train) & buses . Its a plastic world out there.You swipe a card to get in,swipe a card to get out.no tickets.no cash.                          Registered at the university today and got my medical tests done (Hope the HIV test turns out to be negative!).Met a lot of fellow students.Seems to be a great batch.Very diverse .(Culturally & academically).

        Singapore - first impressions                             Well , the title is wrong to start with.Its my fourth visit to Singapore but its going to be the longest one.Currently staying at my uncle's place.One thing that never ceases to amaze about Singapore is its cleanliness .The weather seems as unpredictable as Indian stock markets.It was sunny in the morning,rained in the noon.humid in the evening and rained again.                                    We drove through the university yesterday (Its huge and beautiful green campus) and also went to the famous Singapore Zoo. Tomorrow I would be registering as an MBA Student and entering a new phase in my life.

After 7 long years of completing my Engineering , I am off to the school again (something unthinkable until a few years ago but more common these days in tune with the way its done in the West).I am trying to start with an open mind and I guess my future blogs will have lots of vignettes from my student life,Asia-Pac & Business.God bless me.

        Thekkady              Its nature at its natural.This is the only sanctuary in India where you can have the unique experience of viewing wildlife at close quarters from the safety of a boat on the lake.One of the most beautiful artifical lakes in the world lies here encompassed by the Periyar wildlife Sanctuary .   LOCATION  :  Nearest Airports : Madurai(140 km),Kochi (190 km)   Nearest Railheads : Teni(60 km),Kottayam(114 km),Madurai(140 km) Road : The drive to Thekkady is enchanting as the road winds through tranquil countryside, rich plantations & thick jungles. The sanctuary, 60 km from Idukki, 190 km from Cochin and 114 kms away from Kottayam is open throughout the year .     ACCOMODATION  :  Budget : Hotel Revathy,Mukkumkal Regent Tower,Periyar House(KTDC) High End : Hotel Treetop,Aranya Nivas(KTDC),Lake Palace(KTDC)   TOURIST ATTRACTIONS  :   Thekkady Lake : A splendid artificial lake formed by the Mullaperiyar Dam across the Periyar river adds to the charm of the place.This is the only sanctuary in India where you can have the unique experience of viewing wildlife at close quarters from the safety of a boat on the lake.The Wildlife and the waterbirds make the boat ride an unforgettable experience.The Boat Rides are at 7am,9.30am,11.30am,2pm,4pm respectively.Hence plan your trip accordingly.  Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary : A dense forest which has varied wildlife like Tigers,Elephant,Deer,Wild pigs,Malabar Squirrel and a variety of water birds like Hornbill,mynah,Grey Heron,king fisher,Jungle fowl,Cormorants,woodpeckers.There is a three hour trek into the forest in the mornings and in the afternoons where one could catch sight of plenty of wildlife. The Elephants at Periyar are very famous and a sight to watch (Particulary when they come to drink in the lake). There are also rides on top of an elephant but these are of shorter duration (30 minutes).    PERSONAL EXPERIENCES  : I was on a casual one day visit from Munnar (90 kms) and hence didn't get much time to trek.But the boat ride was awesome and perhaps one of the best I have ever had.I spotted a big Indian Hornbill & numerous grey herons,cormorants,kingfishers,mynahs .I also saw lot of Deers,a group of otters,turtles,Bisons.I was also lucky to get a very close photograph of a giant Malabar Squirrel.Thekkady is a great place if you love wildlife .    TRAVEL TIPS  : Plan for at least 2-3 days at Thekkady.Summer months are better if you want to sight wildlife since they come to the lake to drink.However, if you want to enjoy boating or want to spot water birds come after the monsoons.Always carry a Binocular and camera.There are numerous tourist spots like Munnar,Kochi,Madurai,Kodaikanal close from Thekkady.For once Man's attempt at something artificial (The Lake) has turned out to be sheer beauty.

        Marlon Brando - Obituary                   It was just two days before Marlon Brando died.I was talking to my sister and told her I wanted to see the movie  "Streetcar named desire" (The film based on The famous Tennesse Williams play) and asked her where I could get that DVD/VCD in Chennai.She responded with her usual acerbic remarks about my eccentric movie choices." Why do you have such strange movies as choices ? Anyway I don't think you will get that movie in Chennai" was what she said."Anyways , What is special about that movie ?" she asked , and I just had one word as a response " Marlon Brando " .                   Marlon Brando redefined acting when he burst into the scene.In an age of Charismatic,charming stars like Cary Grant,Gregory Peck,Clark Gable , here was a serious actor who effortlessly morphed into the characters he portrayed.I first saw his performance in the immortal mafia saga " Godfather" . Its tough to imagine anyone else than Brando as Don.Another memorable performance of Brando was in the movie " In the Waterfront" (The first angry young man) .I had also read about his eccentricities & whims (he was notorious for it) in a book by Desmond Morris. The spell cast by Brando in the arena of acting was immense.Not just in Hollywood but everywhere .Be it Dilip Kumar or Sivaji Ganesan or Kamlahaasan (Velu Nayakan perhaps was a tribute to Brando)many Indian film stars have been influenced by Brando's " Method" style of acting.                    Its rare to see great actors like him.perhaps, they come once in a century.

         Frasers Hill - Malaysia       Its a beautiful,quiet little Hillstation with pristine beauty & unspolit environs.Fraser's Hill is about 105km north of Kuala Lumpur. It was built on seven hills, just like the ancient city of Rome. Its unbelievably quite &amp; calm with a variety of Outdoor activities to offer.        When to go ?  Any time of the year, but best times are between March and September.       How to go ?  Overland via Kuala Kubu Baru (TR 55) and then take the junction at the "Gap" for Fraser's Hill. The last 8 kms from the Gap to Fraser's Hill is a regulated road allowing only one-way traffic, uphill (odd hours) and downhill (even hours), by daylight (It is not advisable to make this leg of the journey at night).        Attractions :  Trail walking and treks, bird watching, photography.There is also a Golf Course (9 Hole),Horse-riding & Waterfalls.The annual International Bird-watching contest attracts large number of tourists during the month of June every year. The Silver park apartments (Where we stayed) also offers facilities like Archery,Trekking,Nature Walks etc.        Personal Experiences :  I have never seen a more quiet town than this.The Trails are exciting and offer you a glimpse of the famed Malaysian Rain forests.The Tall trees and thick shrubs are densely populated, creating one of the thickest vegetation I have ever witnessed.I was unlucky not to spot much birds .The Jeriau Waterfalls is a great place where the water gushes at a very high speed (I felt as if stones were falling on me under the falls ! ).Visit the WWF office in the Market place and they help you a lot in planning your treks.On the way back we drove through Kualalumpur downtown &amp; saw the famed Petronas Towers (The Tallest building in the planet until recently).        Afterthoughts :  Perhaps I should come back to Frasers Hill during the Annual Bird Watching contest. That should be fun.Also KL(Kualalumpur) was just a fleeting visit and I shall try to go back there sometime before the end of this year.

        Jay Leno's One-liner on India   An interesting (Humorous) One-liner from the Tonight show by Jay Leno on India :  On this day in 1492, Columbus set sail from Europe, looking for a sea route to India - and ended up in America. And ironically, if you make a call from Europe to a company in America today - it’s re-routed to India.

        Malaysia - Here I come                                             Over the next few days I would be Travelling to Kaulalampur &amp; Frasers Hill in Malaysia. Frasers Hill is a small hill station located 70 Kms to the North of Kaulalampur and is supposed to be a birdwatcher's paradise (I am missing my Salim Ali's equivalent book here). We would also be visiting Kaulalampur enroute on the way.So next blog after a few days.

        Life is Strange                                   I got a one year Multiple entry Visa to Malaysia last week. Its a long weekend here in Singapore (Monday being National Day). My uncle's family is travelling to Malaysia and am going with them too.It would be my first visit to Malaysia.                                  Life is Strange.Incidentally my interview at IIM-Indore is Scheduled for this Saturday.Of course I would not be attending it since I have already commenced my MBA here in Singapore in a very good B-school. But then , if someone had told me a few years ago, that on the day of my IIM (Indian Institute of Management) Interview , I would be Travelling in Malaysia , I would have called them crazy. I now realize nothing can be more crazier than fate !

         Does Everyone Hate an MBA ?                                                    This Happened almost two weeks back.I had just boarded the bus to my School and found an Indian sitting next to me. I said hello to him and learnt that he was about to pursue a Ph.D In Electrical Engineering.He asked me what I was studying.I said MBA. He then went on a advise binge telling me that I was wasting my Engineering skills ( Do I have any ? :-) ) in pursuing an MBA and went on to prove almost theoritically that there is not much use in doing an MBA and if at all you want to do it there is not much difference if you did it from Harvard or IGNOU (IGNOU would love to have him in their PR Dept !).I have never had any illusions myself that MBA is a supreme degree of studies.But it definitely doesn't deserve the abomination shared by most so called " serious academecians" .                                                    By simple law of economics , for the society to survive we need all kinds of people.Carpenters,masons,farmers,doctors,engineers,lawyers.......and of course managers.I remember a passionate article written by an IIT Prof a few years back condemning IIT-ans who directly jump from an IIT to an IIM thereby wasting governement subsidised money funded towards creating engineers. (This was the argument : Why is an aeronautical engineer after studying 4 years at IIT directly jumping to an IIM and start selling soaps for an FMCG company ? Its a colossal waste of Money,Talent,Opportunity ). I am unqualified to comment on this.I have a lot to learn perhaps to even say which side is right.But the question of individual tastes,preferences are overlooked in most of the serious arguments.Most anti-MBA arguments stem from the assumption that MBA as a Coursework is done just for enhancing one's personal worth and seeking lucrative jobs. I do agree that the focus of a B-school must be in creating entrepreneurs as much as corporate managers.                                 A friend recollected this incident during one of his B-School interviews.   Interviewer : Name a few people you admire ?    Candidate : Bill Gates,Narayanamurthy,Dhirubhai Ambani,Jack Welch,.....   Interviewer : None of the names you mentioned has an MBA. Then Why do you want to do an MBA ?

         Finalisation of Subjects                                           After sitting through all the lectures during the first week , I have finally finalised the subjects I am taking in the first trimester of my MBA.I have chosen Economics,Finance,Accountancy & Operations Management.                             Banking & Finance has always fascinated me.Perhaps,its in the lineage considering my Dad,Uncles are all successful Bankers at Top positions.So I have taken as many finance subjects as possible with an intention of specializing in it. I intend to take a mix of Technology &amp; Finance subjects during my coursework.Its a gamble in many ways since I am pretty new to hard core finance (My knowledge of Finance is limited to Business magazines,books & stock market gossips ! ).                         But then having spent most of my life at knowing " what I am not good at " I think there is no harm is testing " what I am good at" :-)
