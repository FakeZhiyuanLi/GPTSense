      Recently I have been reading this book, "Bomb the Suburbs" by william upski wimsatt.  It's about a lot of different things, but it's mainly about preservation.  Preservation of the lifestyles we enjoy and the music we embrace.  There is a general problem with the suburbs, and that's the mentality.  The fact that the people in the city have things to worry about if we fuck up our surroundings.  I live on 14th and Park, about two blocks from downtown, If I look out my window I can see the problems caused by the assholes that run to the sticks to live in their nice houses with gardeners and friendly mailpersons.  Fuck that.  I like anonymity.  I am a people person, don't get me wrong, but that's exactly the thing I hated about high-school, college, and pretty much all of St. Cloud.  Everyone is all up in eachothers shit so far that is sickening.  Not to metion the closed-mindedness of a click.  Read this book, I promise you it won't dissapoint.  If you like it, meybe even read these wonderful books as well. No More Prisons     ~ William Upski Wimsatt How to Get Stupid White Men Out Of Office     ~ The League of Pissed Off voters, edited by William Upski Wimsatt

      Raining today, I have to go to work, blah.  On the plus side, I found an awesome apartment on the edge of downtown.  It's a 3rd floor corner apartment, with hard wood floors.  yay. well, gotta go.  "for as much as I love autumn, I'm giving myself to ashes." ~From Autumn To Ashes

      If you park your car beneath a building, covered in vines, inhabited by dozens of birds and their nests, don't act all surprised when they shit all over your car.  You asked for it, and it's not like you didn't know what was gonna happen.  You fucking parked there!  You were prolly in a hurry, and were like, "My BMW is expensive and shiny,costs more than anything you've ever owned, and nicer than most people homes, so no birds would ever shit on it....would they?".  Meanwhile your buddy is in his office like, "Oh snap!  I parked under the vines again!  I remember last time!  I gotta go move my ride!".  He drives a Honda hatchback, with rusted out windshield wipers an weater-stripping that's shriveled up to the point of uselessness, so the last thing he wants to hear at lunch is about your stupid car-poop problems.  Get on the ball, man, or get left behind.  You're shiny ride of gluttony deserves to be desecrated.  Jerk.

      http://www.bergenhiphop.com   ~  gotta love the Akeron!  "Ooh, I love this track." ~ Bullet Tooth Tony, as he drags Mullet down the street dangling from his car.   I got a few good fortune cookies lately, which is good, if you're into superstition or luck or whatever.  One was,"You will always get what you want through your charm and personality.".  Another was something like, "your body is for use, not abuse."  which I kinda take issue with.  Where do Body Modifications fall?  Use?  Abuse?  Is decoration of the only tangible thing you will ever truly own abuse, or just proper use?  Is skateboarding and falling down a million times before you actually get the trick right abuse?  Or are you just doing what your body is allowing you to do, being as it regenerates the damage (assuming it isn't irreparable)?  Of all the fortunes I got, they really should just be called wisdom cookies, The best one was, "To understand, listen beneath the words.".  Now that's wisdom, and with wisdom, hopefully comes good fortune.

      Lately it has come to my attention that I am a little uptight.  maybe not uptight to the point of like, cataloging all my shoes and socks for easy access, but uptight enough to blow up on some fool for no reason.  To those I have been hostile to, I am sorry.  With that out of the way, on to matters of the heart.  Work today was normal.  A good laugh session raises morale I think.  I saw a sign on the street today that said Killme Electric.  That has a nice ring to it.  Also, I'm looking to move out of the basement soon, and quit starbucks.  I hate it.  The employees are all so cold all the time. I come in late.  I dispise it.  Maybe Dunn Bros. will hire me.

      My name, Magic Brad, was stolen.  Not in the respect that I had it and someone bit me, admittedly I bit it from someone else.  The main difference here is that he is an actual magician, where as I just thought is sounded cool.    So now I wonder, are magicians violent people?  Should I fear for my life?  Will I wake up one day and be sawed in half?  Impaled upon a dozen swords?  or maybe he'll just make me vanish entirely.  But then where would I go when I was gone?

      I just remembered I never explained the buddy power twins.  They are these two little matchbox guys who, when you push down their heads, scream "let's help someone!"  or "let's dig it!"  or "Buddy power!".  They replaced the Potato Head and so far they've been a rousing success.  Time will only tell at this point whether or not they too will find themselves in that big action-figure heaven in the sky....

      This morning I woke up all bright and early, only to feel super shitty, and ultimately vomit while attempting to shower.  Needless to say, I took another shower.  There's this toy.  It's a Mr. Potato Head that talks.  It says terribly stupid things, over and over and over again.  That's where the name of this blog came from.  One day at work, Colin and I were trying to figure out how to make the thing work, because up until now it had been on the demo mode and no one had actually played the game, which was some sort of Simon Says rip-off.  So we get him to work, but not before having to push the same button and hear the same five words incessantly.  "I know what you're thinking...." said the Potato Head.  How pretentious!  If he already knew that, he would have shut up in order to save his own life.  "I bet you've never heard a talking potato before." he said, and I must admit, he was right.  In the end, he did get what was coming to him.  Just as we figured out how to play the game, he was thrown away by our assistant manager.  Fortunately, he was replaced by the Buddy Power Brothers!

      So anyways, I'm at work today and a fellow co-worker and I get this sudden impulse for mischief.  There's always no shortage of crappy toys at our disposal, so we took this little plastic figure of The Ultimate Warrior, you know, the wrestler, and decided to light him on fire.  We went out back to the loading dock and put only the tiniest of flames to Mr. Warrior's hands, but within seconds the small plastic steroid-riddled action figure was fully engulfed in flames.  Really, if he had maybe even gotten to close to a barbeque or someone had used a magnifying glass on him, it prolly would have had the same result.  How safe are your children?

      I got promoted at my job, I'm an ass man now.  I seem to get lotsa ass man positions.  Hmmm.  That didn't sound right.  anyways, it's windy and blue outside, and I finished Bomb the Suburbs, so now I'm reading No More Prisons, by the same author.  here's an excerpt from a cool song by Alexisonfire called "Counterparts and number them."  Jennifer, they lied to you when they said you couldn't breath underwater. I lied to when I said I was hard, because I'm softer than a thrift store sweater and twice as worn in. I was cast away once but I will be found again. This I promise you.   how fun!

      They Might Be Giants are coming to MPLS someitme in the next month.  For anyone who is interested.  Also, They did a song on Homestarrunner.com. It's about tropical laserbeams, whatever the hell that means.  Anyways, I've been riding Motorcycles all day because I had part 2 of the safety class today.  It was fun. we got to stop real fast and skid and stuff.  More practice tomorrow and then.... dun dun dunnnnnnnn.....the TEST!  Everyone wish me luck, I'd do the same for you if you had a blog and were taking your morotcycle beginner safety course.  That was a mouthful.  Speaking of mouths being full, I'm off to have Jim Beam and supper.  Not in that order. Piece.

      I have moved.  I am mostly completely moved in, save for a few unmentionables.  Conan has been a repeat for the past few nights and I'm upset.  I've seen them all.....now I want new stuff.  Blasted radiowaves, seeping into my subconscious, making me crave Conan.  There may be some kind of housewarming party sometime in the next weeks, so I'll keep those invited posted.  Here's a tricky question:  How do you go about inviting those people whom you want to be at your party, to your party, while there are elements of unfavorable riff-raff around?  Do you invite them privately?  The other guy isn't a bad guy, you just don't want him coming to your party, getting drunk, as is his fashion, and vomiting in your fish tank....again.  So you are left to think,"Am I just a snob?  Should I invite guy, even though he's a slobbering drunk?  Maybe mail invites?" and meanwhile the one person you did face-to-face invite is telling the unfavorables that you don't plan to invite them.  Now you've fucked yourself.  I hope your happy.  P.S. Come to my party.

      I've got some kinda cold, and it sucks.  On the other hand, It made me lie in bed and watch an entire documentary about a woman who lost her father in Vietnam, before she was old enough to remember him.  If this strikes your interest, check it out at: http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/begoodsmilepretty/ Be Good, Smile Pretty is a film by Tracy Droz Tragos, and a very good one at that.  So I suppose Memorial Day this year did teach me something.  Also I watched Larry King Live, something I usually can't stand doing, Becuase It was a tribute to the late great Johnny Cash. Very interesting indeed.  Have a nice couple of days, as gloomy as it is, and I'll type at you soon.

      There's this new  urlLink Caribou Coffee   drink, that is mixed with Reese's PB Cups.  Really, it's terrible, but the prospect of a PB flavored coffee drink was very interesting to me.  There are several things that are interesting to me as of late.  I will delve deeper.  The dastardly  urlLink DFL .  I say this because they have been trying very hard to get people to vote by standing outside of every  urlLink yuppie   urlLink hipster  bar/coffee shop for months now.  I can respect the effort.  I know plenty of people who need a little political nudge.  However, the  urlLink Green party  does not get the same respect.  I'm a firm believer of truth in advertising, and to go out posting up flyers that say "Summer Jobs!  Defeat Bush!"  and barely telling people that it's for the green party seems kinda shady.   urlLink GreenPeace  did sort of the same thing.  They had people standing outside the yipster bars/coffee shops,  but when passers-by got too annoyed with them, they changed the color of their shirts and moved across the street.  Bastards.  At least just admit that you're annoying, you know?  Don't try to mislead me.  That just makes you three times as irritating.  to be continued......
