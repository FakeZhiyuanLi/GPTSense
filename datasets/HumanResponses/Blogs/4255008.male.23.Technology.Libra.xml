						   So I have a blog. Again. Sorta. I hope.  I am going to keep this here prime piece of cyberspace delight more in the form of a bulletin board less the thumbtacks and annoying holes that they leave behind.  I'll primarily post articles, quotes, lyrics and other things unsaid by me that both tickle my fancy and better yet pertain to the life I see around me. That’s what I did last night with the Civil War piece. I also have a sinful fetish for all those completely baseless quizzes that seem to populate the web faster than rabbits in a cage and I equally I like daily memes so I'll probably do a number of each.   Entries directly related to me personally will be rare if at all so if you're looking for a voyeur or confessor please pass on. Anyone remaining I invite to take Shel’s advice and stay with me awhile.

						   Look at your young men fighting Look at your women crying Look at your young men dying The way they've always done before  Look at the hate we're breeding Look at the fear we're feeding Look at the lives we're leading The way we've always done before  My hands are tied The billions shift from side to side And the wars go on with brainwashed pride For the love of God and our human rights And all these things are swept aside By bloody hands time can't deny And are washed away by your genocide And history hides the lies of our civil wars  Did you wear a black armband When they shot the man Who said "Peace could last forever" And in my first memories They shot Kennedy I went numb when I learned to see So I never fell for Vietnam We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all That you can't trust freedom When it's not in your hands When everybody's fightin' For their promised land  And I don't need your civil war It feeds the rich while it buries the poor Your power hungry sellin' soldiers In a human grocery store Ain't that fresh I don't need your civil war  Look at the shoes your filling Look at the blood we're spilling Look at the world we're killing The way we've always done before Look in the doubt we've wallowed Look at the leaders we've followed Look at the lies we've swallowed And I don't want to hear no more  My hands are tied For all I've seen has changed my mind But still the wars go on as the years go by With no love of God or human rights 'Cause all these dreams are swept aside By bloody hands of the hypnotized Who carry the cross of homicide And history bears the scars of our civil wars  I don't need your civil war It feeds the rich while it buries the poor Your power hungry sellin' soldiers In a human grocery store Ain't that fresh And I don't need your civil war I don't need your civil war I don't need your civil war Your power hungry sellin' soldiers In a human grocery store Ain't that fresh I don't need your civil war I don't need one more war  I don't need one more war Whats so civil about war anyway  -- "Civil War" Copyright Guns N' Roses 1991
