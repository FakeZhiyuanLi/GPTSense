      When confronting the enemy, you must put yourself in the mindset of the enemy; almost become the enemy.  Can this theory be applied across the board? I’m taking it to the next level.  Ever asked yourself, “If I were a set of car keys, where would I be?” I happen to ask myself this question all of the time.  So today I fight the data grid.  I must span two pages wide, operate on a page by page basis and construct myself into the super grid when al in completed.  How am I going to do this? I will start by thinking about my size, how wide am I versus a piece of paper.  I then divide myself evenly between these pages.  I calculate my overall page length based on an average of regular row entries, usually 6 to 8 lines per entry.  Then I add in my header and footer.  By the end I will be spit out in a byte array format and straight to a out to the user.  Easy you say? Well maybe for you, but I’m not really a grid.  I’ll end this on a rather long thought in my mind: That programmer are the rulers of the galaxy.  You might think that it’s some strange industry, like the CEOs and other executives of a major corporation.  This is not the case.  Every day the world bends itself a little more towards our world, and the meek shall inherit the earth.  Lesson here: Do not screw with us.    How would I hedge towards this opinion? Take a look at it.  What industry does not need our services, and willing to pay a fair sum to get it?  What industry do we need? The manufacturers and fabricators might be a fair argument; but they are weak in comparison.  They are specialized in what they create; microchips, main boards, tools that create more tools.  And what do all those machines need, programs to run on.  That means us.  Many of you will run out and buy a new program to burn CDs, create cool graphics or even tune your car.  We have the power to create this on our own.  Is it efficient? No, in most cases it is not, but the fact that we have the ability I believe puts us in the power seat.    People may have made fun of programmers some time ago, but we have since ascended to glory.  People love and fear us at the same time.  Why? I think you know, but I’ll explain it anyway.  What are we really capable of? Where do the limits end? When you looked at a geek before you might have thought this guy is smaller than me.  Now you look at us and think I beat him today and tomorrow I don’t even exist anymore.   Do we really have this ability? The truth is more likely that we have no idea, nor the guts to even try something like that.  But you never know the powers that can come with extreme and concentrated hate, and we are also very good at that. Ted Kaczynski was right on several points which I’m not going to go into right now; but you may find that soon the only way to stop our blood reign is complete chaos.   Now that’s some grid thought!

      There were a couple of times there; times when humanity had its chance.  But that time has unfortunately, for you, passed.  This Juggernaut can no longer be stopped.  I can no longer be put in my place.  Magnitude is in full power right now. Have you run into that guy? I’m sure you have.  The one at your work, at school; the one you say to yourself, this man is well on his way to being out of control.  There is one last chance of saving him, and it’s to put him in his place right now.  I need to show him that he’s only human, that things can go wrong so that in the future he won’t screw it up big time, lose it all at once, and end up dead.  Yeah, that was me, ten minutes ago.  Now there is no hope, now I will not be stopped; I cannot be stopped. When were those chances you ask? You could have brought me to my knees when I wasn’t driving Rogue01.  You could have had me for those couple of days I mourned the loss of Amy.  You could have gotten me when I was stepping into that first interview, unsure of my abilities, and what that first assignment would be like. But now, you’re going to have to wait a good amount of time before I revert back to Falter. This inflation is going to be bigger than the Dot Com bust. What brought this about you might ask? You might say it was a small thing, but it was an interview that I had with a potential assignment this morning.  I talked with our sales rep on the way over there and she relayed her feelings that perhaps they were not sure about needing me; too new to the field and so on.  Still I was able to walk into the interview comfortably.  I told myself just let him know what you have, no pretending that you know something you don’t. If you get the assignment then you get it, otherwise it’s no big deal.  By the end of it he stood outside with me and the salesperson and said, if this guy could start for us tomorrow I would love to have him working on this project.  The salesperson was astounded.  On the way back to the car she asked me what the heck I had told this guy that had made him so happy.  I told her that she never had a thing to worry about, Rogue was on the job. Now truthfully I think I know where I stand.  I know there are going to be pitfalls.  I know that sometime I’m going to walk into a place and find that I just don’t have a clue.  But that day is not today, and I’m going to enjoy every moment of it.

      "Men, this stuff that some sources sling around about America wanting out of this war, not wanting to fight, is a crock of bullshit. Americans love to fight, traditionally. All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle. You are here today for three reasons. First, because you are here to defend your homes and your loved ones. Second, you are here for your own self respect, because you would not want to be anywhere else. Third, you are here because you are real men and all real men like to fight. When you, here, everyone of you, were kids, you all admired the champion marble player, the fastest runner, the toughest boxer, the big league ball players, and the All-American football players. Americans love a winner. Americans will not tolerate a loser. Americans despise cowards. Americans play to win all of the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have never lost nor will ever lose a war; for the very idea of losing is hateful to an American.  You are not all going to die.  Only two percent of you right here today would die in a major battle. Death must not be feared. Death, in time, comes to all men. Yes, every man is scared in his first battle. If he says he's not, he's a liar. Some men are cowards but they fight the same as the brave men or they get the hell slammed out of them watching men fight who are just as scared as they are. The real hero is the man who fights even though he is scared. Some men get over their fright in a minute under fire. For some, it takes an hour. For some, it takes days. But a real man will never let his fear of death overpower his honor, his sense of duty to his country, and his innate manhood. Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base. Americans pride themselves on being He Men and they ARE He Men. Remember that the enemy is just as frightened as you are, and probably more so. They are not supermen.  All through your Army careers, you men have bitched about what you call "chicken shit drilling". That, like everything else in this Army, has a definite purpose. That purpose is alertness. Alertness must be bred into every soldier. I don't give a fuck for a man who's not always on his toes. You men are veterans or you wouldn't be here. You are ready for what's to come. A man must be alert at all times if he expects to stay alive. If you're not alert, sometime, a German son-of-an-asshole-bitch is going to sneak up behind you and beat you to death with a sockful of shit!  There are four hundred neatly marked graves somewhere in Sicily.  All because one man went to sleep on the job.  But they are German graves, because we caught the bastard asleep before they did.  An Army is a team. It lives, sleeps, eats, and fights as a team. This individual heroic stuff is pure horse shit. The bilious bastards who write that kind of stuff for the Saturday Evening Post don't know any more about real fighting under fire than they know about fucking!  We have the finest food, the finest equipment, the best spirit, and the best men in the world.  Why, by God, I actually pity those poor sons-of-bitches we're going up against. By God, I do.   My men don't surrender.  I don't want to hear of any soldier under my command being captured unless he has been hit. Even if you are hit, you can still fight back. That's not just bull shit either. The kind of man that I want in my command is just like the lieutenant in Libya, who, with a Luger against his chest, jerked off his helmet, swept the gun aside with one hand, and busted the hell out of the Kraut with his helmet. Then he jumped on the gun and went out and killed another German before they knew what the hell was coming off. And, all of that time, this man had a bullet through a lung. There was a real man!  All of the real heroes are not storybook combat fighters, either. Every single man in this Army plays a vital role. Don't ever let up. Don't ever think that your job is unimportant. Every man has a job to do and he must do it. Every man is a vital link in the great chain. What if every truck driver suddenly decided that he didn't like the whine of those shells overhead, turned yellow, and jumped headlong into a ditch? The cowardly bastard could say, "Hell, they won't miss me, just one man in thousands". But, what if every man thought that way? Where in the hell would we be now? What would our country, our loved ones, our homes, even the world, be like? No, Goddamnit, Americans don't think like that. Every man does his job. Every man serves the whole. Every department, every unit, is important in the vast scheme of this war. The ordnance men are needed to supply the guns and machinery of war to keep us rolling. The Quartermaster is needed to bring up food and clothes because where we are going there isn't a hell of a lot to steal. Every last man on K.P. has a job to do, even the one who heats our water to keep us from getting the 'G.I. Shits'.  Each man must not think only of himself, but also of his buddy fighting beside him. We don't want yellow cowards in this Army. They should be killed off like rats. If not, they will go home after this war and breed more cowards. The brave men will breed more brave men. Kill off the Goddamned cowards and we will have a nation of brave men. One of the bravest men that I ever saw was a fellow on top of a telegraph pole in the midst of a furious fire fight in Tunisia. I stopped and asked what the hell he was doing up there at a time like that. He answered, "Fixing the wire, Sir". I asked, "Isn't that a little unhealthy right about now?" He answered, "Yes Sir, but the Goddamned wire has to be fixed". I asked, "Don't those planes strafing the road bother you?" And he answered, "No, Sir, but you sure as hell do!" Now, there was a real man. A real soldier. There was a man who devoted all he had to his duty, no matter how seemingly insignificant his duty might appear at the time, no matter how great the odds. And you should have seen those trucks on the rode to Tunisia. Those drivers were magnificent. All day and all night they rolled over those son-of-a-bitching roads, never stopping, never faltering from their course, with shells bursting all around them all of the time. We got through on good old American guts. Many of those men drove for over forty consecutive hours. These men weren't combat men, but they were soldiers with a job to do. They did it, and in one hell of a way they did it. They were part of a team. Without team effort, without them, the fight would have been lost. All of the links in the chain pulled together and the chain became unbreakable.  Don't forget, you men don't know that I'm here. No mention of that fact is to be made in any letters. The world is not supposed to know what the hell happened to me. I'm not supposed to be commanding this Army. I'm not even supposed to be here in England. Let the first bastards to find out be the Goddamned Germans. Some day I want to see them raise up on their piss-soaked hind legs and howl, 'Jesus Christ, it's the Goddamned Third Army again and that son-of-a-fucking-bitch Patton'.  We want to get the hell over there.  The quicker we clean up this Goddamned mess, the quicker we can take a little jaunt against the purple pissing Japs and clean out their nest, too. Before the Goddamned Marines get all of the credit.  Sure, we want to go home. We want this war over with. The quickest way to get it over with is to go get the bastards who started it. The quicker they are whipped, the quicker we can go home. The shortest way home is through Berlin and Tokyo. And when we get to Berlin", he yelled, "I am personally going to shoot that paper hanging son-of-a-bitch Hitler. Just like I'd shoot a snake!  When a man is lying in a shell hole, if he just stays there all day, a German will get to him eventually. The hell with that idea. The hell with taking it. My men don't dig foxholes. I don't want them to. Foxholes only slow up an offensive. Keep moving. And don't give the enemy time to dig one either. We'll win this war, but we'll win it only by fighting and by showing the Germans that we've got more guts than they have; or ever will have. We're not going to just shoot the sons-of-bitches, we're going to rip out their living Goddamned guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks. We're going to murder those lousy Hun cocksuckers by the bushel-fucking-basket. War is a bloody, killing business. You've got to spill their blood, or they will spill yours. Rip them up the belly. Shoot them in the guts. When shells are hitting all around you and you wipe the dirt off your face and realize that instead of dirt it's the blood and guts of what once was your best friend beside you, you'll know what to do!  I don't want to get any messages saying, "I am holding my position." We are not holding a Goddamned thing. Let the Germans do that. We are advancing constantly and we are not interested in holding onto anything, except the enemy's balls. We are going to twist his balls and kick the living shit out of him all of the time. Our basic plan of operation is to advance and to keep on advancing regardless of whether we have to go over, under, or through the enemy. We are going to go through him like crap through a goose; like shit through a tin horn!  From time to time there will be some complaints that we are pushing our people too hard. I don't give a good Goddamn about such complaints. I believe in the old and sound rule that an ounce of sweat will save a gallon of blood. The harder WE push, the more Germans we will kill. The more Germans we kill, the fewer of our men will be killed. Pushing means fewer casualties. I want you all to remember that.  There is one great thing that you men will all be able to say after this war is over and you are home once again. You may be thankful that twenty years from now when you are sitting by the fireplace with your grandson on your knee and he asks you what you did in the great World War II, you WON'T have to cough, shift him to the other knee and say, "Well, your Granddaddy shoveled shit in Louisiana." No, Sir, you can look him straight in the eye and say, "Son, your Granddaddy rode with the Great Third Army and a Son-of-a-Goddamned-Bitch named Georgie Patton!" -George S. Patton

      If you thought the posts before were bad, wait ‘til you read this one: It’s not that I even really think that your girlfriend is the right one for me.  It’s just my belief that all the good ones are taken.  There are not a lot of girls out there that like that ego/self loathing kind of guy, but your girlfriend seems to be one of them.  Go figure. So what happened between Roguen and your girlfriend? Actually nothing.  They may have gotten close, but there was always something there to stop him.  What was that? It could be that lousy friendship you have with him, you know, the one where you don’t talk anymore because you think something really DID happen between Roguen and your girlfriend.  But don’t take my word for it, I was only there.  Was it for her: because Roguen knew the truth, that he wasn’t good enough for her anyway, and you made her happier, and it didn’t matter whether she knew it now or later?  Perhaps it’s like I said, Roguen was just plain out not interested, and you, making a jealous ass of yourself have decided to dissociate from Roguen for the duration. Well then I have only one thing to say, I am sorry for you.  You ask me and I tell you the truth: Nothing happened that night.   But if it was anybodies fault, it was mine.  For once I couldn’t follow up my words with the corresponding actions.  Roguen cannot be trusted with your girlfriend.  Btw, this is for you, not those others.  Something did happen between me and their girlfriends. Am I joking? All this for the person who said, "I would like to see girl crazy Roguen" when I told him that I have the power to change personality as I wish.  Nobody ever said you were a smart one.  Well you did, but does that count?  Actually this has nothing to do with your intelligence.  You just never did figure out how to manipulate me to your liking.   So is the match still on or has someone fallen? I lost some battles I admit, so have you.  But have you now lost this war?

      There seems to be two separate people stemming from my point of view.  Is this the cause or the effect though? I happen to care a lot about what people think of me.  People around me can agree or disagree with that, but I’m just laying it out the way that I believe it is. A conversation this weekend revealed to me these two paths: Care about what other people think and change to try and get them to like you, or hate them and follow the path that you feel suits you.  The other person involved in this conversation believed as I do that I take the latter of these two.  This leads to my inability to really like being around people.   Sure, when I’m at a social event, I converse, I interact with the people around me, but I’m doing a lot of it so that they won’t ask me if I’m having a good time.  I am often having a good time, or at least content, with just sitting around and watching others.  I don’t even like for people to know that I’m there.  However it seems that when I fall silent so do the people around me.  Somehow everybody seems to be gauging the outcome of an event based on how well I liked it.  If I say it’s not cool, then it’s not cool.  That’s a lot of power right? Well please, for me, be a little more independent!  The last time I went out with some friends I actually found myself hiding so that they would not worry about the fact I was just sitting there doing nothing.  Why go out then if you don’t like it? Keep reading. This conversation claimed however, that while this might be true for some people who do care about others opinions, I was still not one of these people.  The reasoning: I’m not one of those people who count the number of people on their phone, the number of calls they receive in a day.  Quite contrary, I keep as few numbers on there as possible.  I feel that a “social” call is a waste of time.  I like to delegate duty off to the people who I call.  They call everybody else to come out to do something.  That’s if I was actually get an event together, which I seldom do, more than likely I follow everyone else to do something. I’m sure you’re getting a feeling from at this point that Roguen has a good amount of ego to him.  You might even get this impression being around me for a short period of time.  But if I can ask you to do anything right now it’s to please not judge me on this. It’s saying things out on the line like this that scares me, because people can so easily pick them apart and throw it back at me.  It’s true; I have a good amount of pride.  I hate to look ignorant; I hate to be the man on the short end of the stick.  Does that make me better than anyone else? Absolutely not, and I have never thought this was the case.  Quite the contrary, I see myself in this everlasting catch up game with the rest of society.  I take too long to make my decisions.  I am sure that sooner or later my inability to call people, to let them know how I feel is going to become a problem, because after a while people stop calling you.  People stop caring about what you’re doing; if you’re happy. So change then Roguen.  Well that’s what I mean.  I’m powerless; powerless to stop the albatross of my reality.  I see the future, I have friends that want to help, but I will never relinquish control to them.  Pride or fear, self-loathing or anger; Rogue is a static form.  I cannot change, I will not change.

      As if I could really write a how-to on the subject, no rather that was just a line to get you interest and then I do the whole bait and switch.  I was watching the Butterfly Effect the other day.  I’m not going to tell you that it was a good script.  I’m certainly not going to tell you a hell of a lot of great acting went on there, but still it rehashed that old thought of “What if I could change everything”.  It’s actually one of my favorites, one which you will find me laying awake wondering about 68% of the time.  I personally was a fan of the way things turned out in the end of the movie.  He finds that the way he could save them all was to take himself out of their lives.  I think that’s great.  I’ve been a fan of that idea my whole life!  If I think about it long enough I think that I will finally surmise that the course I took was the one that was right, but that does not stop me from wondering what would have really happened if I had gone after Jenni instead of Amy; if I had not lied my life away in high school to keep everyone interested for the moment. Those are all trivial it seems to the one big question though: What if I had never bought that car all those years ago.  Imagine the one thing that both broke you and made you; the single most influential moment of your life.  That’s what this prized possession is to me. I’ve had this car for just over 9 years now.  It’s far more than just the object of the car though.  There would be no Roguen without it… seriously.  Where would the relationship with my dad stand? It was working on that car that forced me to take the time to understand him, to love him again.  Was it the car that stood between me and a good relationship with all the time I spent on it? Did it save me the agony or the ecstasy?  What would I be driving if not for the mustang? I believe it would most likely be a Honda of Hyundai.  I would be looking at all these muscle cars and laughing to myself every time I passed the gas station.  I would wonder what the hell they saw in working on cars.  More than that, I think I would be looking down my nose at these guys with their old American cars, believing that I was the other side of the fence, pitted directly against them. There is plenty that could come out of this alone, and I continue to wonder?  What was your defining moment?  And more importantly, can you forgive yourself for not being able to take all roads?

      Well Raymond wrote in and told me that I should change my name to Raymond and thus collect on the love.  Thanks Raymond but I'm kind of attached to the name as is, so I figured I would attempt to just put "Everybody loves" in front of it and see what that nets me The fact that I have a reply from someone I have never met before puts a kind of odd feeling in me today.  I means I was right about spilling my guts to strangers, but apparently also means that I can garner response.  I guess I just didn’t think of that part in the calculation. So I thought in a response to it I would put down a couple of the automated responses that I have accumulated over the years.  There is a theory behind it which I will explain. So people go throughout life believing that there is some sort of randomness in the world; like thinking of the first number off the top of your head.  I’m not sure if this is true for you, but 68% of the time that number is the same.  Divide up the last 32% to the millions of other numbers and that’s quite high.  So what is the number that pops into Roguen’s head all of the time.  Surprise! It’s 52. People who know me are probably saying to themselves 52? Roguen always uses 68, I mean with everything, including just a minute ago.  Funny that, see it’s part of the experiment.  I have been trying for the past couple of years to change my “static random” number.  I figured that it I consciously switched the random number with 68 perhaps this could be done.  So instead I will use random numbers like 6 to 8, 68, 168 and so on to fit the situation.  I try to convince friends to also get themselves a static number and replace the random numbers in their lives.  Oddly enough, I still think 52 every times I reach for a random number.  I’m not sure, but I think it has something to do with a deck of cards.  And I don’t even play cards.  How random is that? So I have expanded this idea and decided to simplify MY universe with automated responses to certain situations.  Why would I do this? I’ll give you real life, not directly on point, real life example.  I was going an out of state bar with friend.  At the door a guys and girl stood checking IDs.  The girl looks at my ID and says, so you’re from so and so.  I being the clever one say, “no it’s a fake” and smile, she smiles, the guy goes haywire.  He takes the ID and claims that I should never say that to someone checking IDs because they have to take it then.  I was unaware of this.  I did persuade him to give me back the ID, but I started to think about the response.  How do you respond to a question like that?  Well it was funny that I had to leave and come back in.  A new girl stood at the door.  She looks at the ID and what? Says “So you’re from so and so.” I look at her and go.  “Yes, that it where I am from with a dumb look on my face.”  The lesson here, don’t be a sarcastic bastard, because nobody thinks you’re funny anyway.  Lesson 2, automate your response.  Here are a couple of those responses:  When on a date, I like to lay a couple of the ground rules out for my lady first.  This is just so that she knows where we stand up front. 1.  The car comes first, if you’re good enough you can come second.  (I have been told to get rid of this one right away.) 2. My dad gets the first 3 born.  As in, he will walk into the delivery room and take them in payment, we may see then when we visit him, but they will never know that we are their birth parents.  (expand that first statement to all of this on second thought) 3.There is a third, but usually I can’t get past the first 2, so I forgot.  What I am looking for in a woman: 1. Has her name in Binary on her left arm.  Those who know me, know why 2. Loves to give backrubs and on command. 3. Cooks a great steak.  I don’t even care if she’s vegetarian, as long as she cooks a great steak. Mind you this is a phenomenal girl right her, to even have the first is grounds for marriage in my book.  I don’t care what she looks like, how she smells, or what she drives… alright, so the smell thing might be an overstep.  Moving on: so that’s a great girl, but there are also several indicators of a very nice girl: 1. School teacher, preferably early learning. 2. Long dark hair 3. Loves to play Galaga (this needs to be moved up further on the list)  Automated CS responses: 1. That’s really weird 2. It’s not my fault 3. It must be the   (I prefer BIOS, that always gets ‘em) Well, Rogue’s time is up and I have written a lot more than I probably should have.  Perhaps I’ll come back to this topic on a later date.

      So I’m a big Star Wars fan.  Love the old ones, hate the new ones, as any self respecting fan would.  But here’s the deal.  I always wanted to be Han Solo.  Why not right, he’s the guy with the fast ship, doesn’t take shit from nobody, takes off or stays when he wants to.  Has a big heart under all of that rough exterior.  You see when I’m getting at with this right. And a lot of people agreed with this for several reasons.  I have a car that I always claim is fast, but when it counts it just kind of sputters out.  I stand somewhere off to the sidelines and would rather not get involved, however I do car.  The comparison is a decent one; that and the devilish good looks. But t was not meant to be.  Alas, the comparison to that whiny little bitch Luke Skywalker is a far more compelling comparison.  Let’s take a look at the facts shall we: Owned a land speeder and was always going down to tochi station to pick up some power converters, presumable for it; religious as apposed to the atheist Han Solo; leader of Rogue group, where he piloted Rogue01.  This is also where I got the name of my car, and subsequently my own name. But there is more than just that.  The story of Star Wars can, if I stretch it far enough, take a very personal likeness to my own life.  As a kid watching the movie I loved them, but I could never understand that culminating moment before the Emperor.  Telling Luke that he had to join the Dark Side.  Where did that come from? What exactly was going to bin Luke to this old man’s will?  It’s unfortunate to say, but these days I understand it all too well.  There is constantly that pull to use your powers of intelligence, appearance and even charisma to get what you want and where you want in this world.  The hard way is to actually earn that privilege, not steal it. Don’t assume that it stops there though.  I’m not going to go into it now, but there is also a good amount of comparison that can be drawn between Darth Vader and my father (no offense dad).  Let’s just say this though: I am a Jedi like my father before me.

      Ladies and Gentlemen, let’s do a little bit of clearing up here on the whole car issue.  A lot of people think that because I drive an old classic car around that I have to hate everything new on the street.  Much to the contrary, I actually love to see cars that have been “tricked out” modified or what have you, much the same way I would like to see it done with a computer case and system.   I don’t claim that I understand everything that goes on here.  For instance, remember the fast and furious, with those cars with the really nasty California paint jobs.  It looked like somebody had dressed the damn thing up in a sweater vest.  The clear tail lights thing kind of loses me, especially on some cars where it just stands out as not belonging. So what exactly do I like.  I like to see a Honda civic that cost the guy about a thousand dollars and still makes that super sucking noise when he stands on it and rips the gears back.  I love to see an eclipse with all wheel drive that can stop on a dime in the snow.  Now that’s respectable.  Hell I even like the blue lights under the car sometimes, black tinted windows and a sound system that makes it sound like an earthquake is on the way.  I like a smooth paint job that you can just see reflecting under the highway lights as it flies along at a hundred or so.  I love to see low profile tire and cars that look like they would hit every bump on the road but somehow don’t.   But stick a coffee can on the end of your exhaust and claim that you’re getting horsepower from it.  Then take the sticker that came in the package and put it on your rear bumper or window.  Put a spoiler the size of the car on the back and claim it’s for high speed down force.  Now your pissing me off. These are the same people who tell me I should get a cat back system for my 1968 mustang… which does not have a catalytic converter.  Tell me that I should make it look like Eleanor from gone in 60 seconds, tell every charger owner it should like the General Lee.   I love cars… period.  I just happen to think that the people driving them are worthless.  I like them enough that if I didn’t already have a classic car I would probably have one of theirs.  But I do have a classic car, it does run pretty fast, and there isn’t a chance I’m going to give it up for anything.

      It wasn't any particular event.  At least I don't think.  Perhaps it's just the lifestyle, the way that I treat or act around people.  But somehow, even without ill intent, everybody hates me! How did that happen.  I'm suppose to be the hater here, not the hated.  But then again, when is the last time you loved someone who just hated you.  So in that way I guess it makes sense.

      So I'm falling part slowly but surely.  Some would claim before my time.  I say that I'm  right on time if not behind schedule.  The running is taking it's toll on my knees.  The LCD I stare at every morning is killing my eyes and the case of pop I drink on a daily basis has to be rotting my teeth out.  It's been an odd morning of reflection and al started with a dream from last night. Now mind you this is a bit odd, becuase this is one of those things that you look back at and say why would I be so stupid as to put these things out in the open for everybody to see, but I'm going to claim temporary insanity for the time being and use it for my own therapy. So, I was back in some kind of classroom and I ran into Stephanie again.  Well rather I tried to run pash her when she grabbed me and forced me to talk to her.  This didn't take a devestating amount of persuasion as I remember, but I just spilled my guts about actually missing her and wishing that I could call sometimes, knowing that she was just as stuborn as I was and that she would never call me, not that she even really cared.   At this moment I woke up in one of those cold sweats.  What the hell had I just done.  I was calmed by the knowledge that I had not actually told her these things.   Why would that be comforting you might ask?  Well I do have this problem with my own pride, and I hate to let people know that I actually need them around, that I might want them around.  The pride becomes a factor when you add in the fear of being let alone, and you would rather think that it was choice, not there's. Back to Stephanie and I.  This wasn't technically a breakup, because she had never actually wanted to advance us to the level of going out.  In fact, any time that I really look at it, this girl didn't even really like me.  Sure it's easy for her not to call.  She didn't give a shit about what happened to me anyway.  That day I said goodbye to her it wasn't because I was mad and had enough... seriously.  It was because I knew the whole thing was over anyway.  And the only way that I could maintain the good memories with her was to at least allow a couple of years of 'cool down' time between us.  In other words, I needed to get over her.  Even with as little as I would admit to actually liking her.  I liked her, and every asshole part of her body. So it's no mystery what this dream was really about.  It's a simple lesson: Don't act like your a badass with no emotion unless you can hold up your end of the bargain.   Am I going to find her and see what has happened in the missing time, Not a chance.  The lesson has not been learned... yet.

      Did I mention as of late how much I love this laptop?  Did I mention how much I love my car?  Have I mentioned how much I love the laptop in the car? Well in any case, it's another one of those days that is going very well.  Everything is going my way right now, or at least as much my way as I need it to be.  Low expectations? certainly not.  Hell, ask anybody you know about me, and they'll tell you I have some of the highest expectations of them all.  I just happen to lead an incredibly charmed life.  God looks down on me and says "You..." then he points his finger.  "You, your good."

      Living on the Road my friend Was going to keep you free and clean Now you wear your skin like iron your breath as hard as kerosene Weren't your momma's only boy But her favorite one it seemed She began to cry when you said goodbye Sank into your Dreams  Roguen was a bandit boy His horse as fast as polished steel He wore his keys outside his belt For all the world to feel  Roguen met his match you know On the desert down in Mexico Nobody heard his dying words But that's the way it goes  All the police interceptors say They could have had him any day They only let him slip away  Out of kindness I suppose  Beast, now he can't sing the blues All night long like he used to But dusty Roguen bent down south Ended up and left his mount  The day they laid poor Roguen low Beast split for Chicago Where he got the bread to go There ain't nobody knows  The boys tell how Roguen fell And left his living in a cheap motel The deserts quiet Chicagos cold And so the story ends we're told Roguen needs your prayer is true But save a few for old Beast too He only did what he had to do And now he's growing old  A few great interceptors say They could have had him any day They only let him go so long Out of kindness I suppose

      For a blog, no, certainly not, there is never really a time for a blog.  No, I'm talking about the music industry.  Partially why I'm doing this is because I have thoughts like this on a regular basis and I have not got around to creating my own blog on my site yet.  So the point is: The Music Industry has been taking people to court left and right for pirating music, but the figures I keep hearing about (hearsay mind you) show that they are actually doing better for it.  So in effect they were wrong.  Well that's all fine and good, but may I add in that it's about time they are punished.  And I'm not talking about saying nasty things and all, I'm talking paddle to the behind punished! That is all.

      Consumed with memories that preceded today Given a chance to bereave life that’s slipping away Suffered through tragedy of my slow decay Deceptive tendencies dragged my soul away All that I know there was no hope for me Force that shatters all, absence of mortality  Revive all my fears Revive wasted tears Revive void within Revive once again...  Forsaken by destiny, forsaken by my own mind I must remove my skin to see belief in your eyes All that I know there is no hope for me Force that shatters all, absence of humanity  Reach for the sky Touch this mind Revive a hope For mankind  -Fear Factory

      Strait out of the bible right?  Well all of you out there who know about those missing books might recall the small book containing these letters.   So I did meet up with Paul the other day. I told him that I had been waiting for him to come to me.  This is what happened.  After much talk I came to this conclusion: Paul is still a dumbass.  Perhaps Paul is not going to read this today, perhaps he might not read this tomorrow, but if he ever reads it, perhaps then something will get through to him, because I just can’t seem to. Here is the problem.  You might know that Paul and I stopped talking after he sent me in on a badly chosen mission.  One which I could not possibly have completed, because I don’t have the killer instinct.  I told him this but I also made claim that nobody else he knew would have been  able to get as close.  This would include Hatter.  Why, because I carried a sincere intent when I talked to her.  I remember telling her “If it happens that I don’t end up talking to you again, at this point I don’t know you well enough to consider it a loss.” It was strange, but honest, comments like that which beat the barrier of me even knowing Paul.   She of course made a mistake in trusting me, because I allowed Paul to abuse our friendship and I fed him information.  I remember her calling me one night after Paul had pretty much laid all this out for her, showing that he was untrustworthy and basically an ass.  Thanks a lot Paul! So learning from my mistakes I told Paul that I would no longer be relaying information of this kind to him, he had burned the source.  What happened, he gets angry about the whole thing.  According to him, it‘s not about him believing that something happened between me and her; it’s about me lying to him.   Oh that’s precious.  I’m lying to him now.  I didn’t lie about anything.  When he asked me what his chances were, I told him, “If you want that question answered you must go -to the source.” This is a lose-lose with Paul because it meant you have a chance, just talk to her.  I can’t tell you how much this pisses me off still So he wants the truth right? How about telling yourself the truth you nimrod? How about you start realizing that I was your friend, not your snitch?  I don’t expect you to understand that now, and I’m not worried about it anymore. So I did apologize for that lack of communicating skill.  I thought I could convey thoughts.   I recently heard in another interview where Lunis’ (inventor of Linux) teacher is being questioned about his student stealing the coded for his minix OS to make Linux.  His answer, a resounding no.  The result from that interview - Linus has stolen his code from Minix.  The teacher’s retort to this finding went something like this: “I was on the debate team at my school; I thought I was pretty good.  I guess not.” I realized something from this little chat that we had.  It’s dealing with our want for truth.  Paul said he wanted truth, well God bless him.  But I don’t believe that it’s the case.  I believe he wants his truth, he wants to believe that the world has the things which he desires.  He could die trying to find them.  I was worried about that once. I myself already know.  I don’t love being lied to, but I don’t necessarily want the truth if it harms me.  I want you to tell me a lie, but only a perfect lie, because if I ever find out, there will be hell to pay.  Here is the key: only tell me lies that I will end up appreciating.  Tell me lies that would not have mattered in the end anyway.  Don’t tell me things like you love me, because you can’t hold onto that one forever, sooner or later it’s going to be discovered.  Don’t lie to me about things just because you think the attitude will get us through.  There is too great a risk there, there is too much of a chance people will get hurt. Lie to me when you’re taking me to my surprise party.  Lie to me when I’m not looking so good, but a compliment will do me better.  Then lie to me.   So what do I want? I want appreciation.  I said this before and I will say it again.  I want to be appreciated for what I do, for being useful in my situations.  Call me over to fix your computer.  I will spend my own money, I will spend my time.  And if it still does not work I will break my back until it does.  At the end of it I would not even think of asking you for a thing.  I have always turned down the money, but the fact that it was offered shows me appreciation for what I have done.  The smile on your face or that fact that your stress is relieved because of me is what I wanted.  And that my friends is not a lie.

      Static text is not something that should be hard to do.  Assuming you have all your spelling checked, and the grammar is up to snuff, you should be on your way right.  Well lets just assume that your genius in spelling and grammar.  I know I’m not, but you are.  Well if you were working my job you better sure as hell be a genius because my client has found the perfect way to make even static text something that requires a rocket scientist. It’s called XML and properties files, and it’s the hardest test you’ve ever written since the stone tablet. It starts out like this.  I have a single line of static text.  Nothing will change here.  I make a tag fro it in an XML file,  I add in a second array tag for the text that will come in under this “sub header”.  I run a script that makes my 1.6Ghz computer feel like it’s a 286 and 15 minutes later.  I have a properties file.  I fill in the fields for those properties, because they can’t be in the JSP or in the XML for some reason.  Then I create a tag in the JSP that will use this tag from the XML.  That was static text.. in 3 files.  Add in a value that needs to be decoded and your adding on at least one more file and another reference inside of your properties file to another properties file.  Mind you none of this in any discernable order.  And if you did put it in an order, the pass for the compiler would take it out of that order and put it back in disarray.  So basically you have to suck it.   Now I’m obviously not happy about all this.  That’s fine, that’s what I do, and I can get through it.  But add in to it the fact that this is an application that is being built from scratch.  If I stepped into a project like this and was expected to upgrade it I would almost certainly tell them where to stick it.  I would make the claim that it needed to be taken back to the beginning.  I can see this, and it’s just getting started.  Who was the genius who thought this one up? Haven’t heard me get this enraged about anything for while have you.  I think it must be the sleep talking.  It could be the fact that I wasted the day and realized that in the end I would have gotten more done if I had never come in.  Why, because the files were corrupted by the compiler.  It really cooked my oil. So here is the word of advice.  People always come to developers and they say that they need to have a program that works for them.  That they can pick up and use.  I totally believe this is the way that things should work, but that can be very hard to do.  Developers need this to a certain degree also, but here is the catch, this is not impossible.  I work with PHP, JSP, Javascript, HTML, DHTML, Struts, Faces, Eclipse, Java and several other IDEs, languages, Frameworks and all.  Why in the world do we need this one.  Who took this step and where does he live?

      Hi, I’m back.  Just the way you thought it would be.  But this time it’s different.  I’m turning over a new leaf, going in a different direction this time.  Events of the past week have given me a clue as to where I really stand in some matters; and it’s a signal: “change or die”. There have always been the two forces, magnitude and falter, pulling my reactions one way or the other.  I’m two quite and then I can’t keep my mouth shut.  Well maybe I still need to keep my mouth shut, but that doesn’t mean I can’t speak a word.  I’m going to make a real commitment this time to get the feeling back in my body, to not only care about things, but live with some of those consequences, and accept them. Yesterday was father’s day.  I went to visit my dad and while we sat out there working on the car I decided to ask him some of the questions I though I needed to have answers to.  I asked him about his past with his parents and what happened to our family.  Why don’t I see relatives from his side of the family around anywhere?  I know their alive, but we’ll never know each other despite the fact that they have at times just lived a block away. His response was that it was ancient history and I contested.  I gave him a line that he should live by as a history teacher, that those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.  I told him I did not know what had happened back in those days, but I have a feeling that the same thing could happen to me. The response was still not the one I was looking for.  My dad, even after all this time, even with direct questioning, cannot seem to relate the past to me.  Much like me he hopes that by not saying anything about it he might just pass it by and it will be as if nothing was ever wrong.  In simple terms, don’t cry wolf.  But this is not one of those times.  I need to know what could be in store for me.  I need his information to complete a picture of me somehow.  It’s like taking that outside view of yourself 20 years down the line.   His answers on the family put the blame on my mom ways and my grandmothers grudge holding.  I really don’t doubt either of these points, but there IS more.  My dad is an ambitious man, like me.  He is an intelligent man in many respects; creative and knowledgeable on a variety of subjects and tasks. He is also a very giving person, willing to help whenever he can, offering at all times and pleased only with the fact that he helped.  Most times without even so much as appreciation for his efforts.  Yet he cannot help his own impulse to do more, to flex that creative spirit.  Though today he seems to only have the ambition of staying afloat, it seems it is because the great ambition that he had yesterday created this albatross of today. I am just starting on this past, but already my mom calls me a user, past acquaintances, no matter what I really thought of them have echoed these same remarks.  That means something to me still.  Should I discard?  I will not deny my ambition, I cannot live with these things passing me by; knowing that I have been invested in and I am expected to return.  I just feel the stockholders have lost confidence and are now calling for there money back just as soon as they see me making any kind of money.  It’s too soon!

      So I was googling for my name again today, seeing what actually comes up.  Just the other day I was number 2 or 3, now you can’t even find me.  Makes me kind of wonder how I dropped so quickly.  That really doesn’t bother me.  I don’t actually like to find myself on search engines, it kind of creeps me out.  Still I have not switched off the option to have this one posted.  Well that’s just hypocrisy, plain and simple right.  Well, it happens. I did come over this old old post though, from several years ago now, and it makes me see how stupid I once was.  This is also the reason I’m so afraid to post to public forum.  You always miss something that was ridiculously easy and stupid.  Chalk that one up to experience.  Still, that old post even beat out this little blog.  Now that’s just ridiculous. So there are numerous rants and raves that could sputter out today, but for once I’m actually just not feeling like it.  I wonder if perhaps the urge to write has been satisfied for the time being, and it’s time to lay down the keyboard.  Good enough right? Well I suppose that your going to find out tomarrow.

      It’s a big world and there is a lot to be confused about, take for example yesterdays little tidbit on Hollywood and the masses in general which I am a part of.  Well I think I can offer a little bit of insight for you who do not understand the masses, and here it is: So I have on one hand this great set of friends.  They call me up, they come over, they invite me out to things whether or not I come or not.  That’s not such an odd thing right? Well take this into consideration; most friendships are out of convenience.  You work with these people, you go to school with them, or you’re in some sort of club with them.  Well that’s not the case for any of these guys, even if they worked at the same “place” I do, I move around to much for us to even be in the same city most of the time.  These are people who I went to school with, some time ago now and it’s nice to see that even though I never call them up for anything they still feel that I should be included in their lives.   These are the traits of a nerd, a geek, a weirdo to my thinking.  These are the kinds of things that somebody you didn’t want around would do.  They have nowhere else to go, they need approval from someone, and they found you.  Well that does not fit my friends.  These are good people, easy to talk to, caring, and dare I even say good looking.  They don’t need approval from anybody, and believe me, if you can wrench a compliment out of me you have to be within one step of the greatest ever.  In other words, I’m not the person who tells these guys “your doing a great job”.  Quite the opposite; I’ll often tell my girl friends that I think they have gained some weight and they might be going bald.  They think it’s hilarious.  Well I think it’s hilarious, and all they need to do is realize that it’s a joke.   So that’s a good thing right, like I need to ask you.  Well how does that make me feel about myself?  I deal out insults, and they stick around.  I talk to them a lot and they seem to find me amusing/interesting.  The effect, I get a better self image.  I feel that I might be a good person, good enough to keep around.  They see the good in me somehow.   So my girls tell me that I don’t hit on girls enough, that I have to throw them a couple of signs.  I tell them that I do what I feel is natural, and they claim that I’m going to have to take a step out there.  Well that’s all fine and good, but on multiple occasions, and I mean several, I’ve been turned down without even doing that.  Hell, I wasn’t even trying to pick them up; they just got this feeling that perhaps I was.  How did that happen. Example 1: I am talking to a girl on the train. I had just had lunch with her and some friends who had met her that morning.  I did not.  We were going the same way.  When we get off the train we are going to go our separate ways and I offer to invite her out again with us sometime.  She tells me that she doesn’t have a phone number.  Curious, but I figure she’s telling the truth.  I am talking to my friend that night and I mention how she didn’t have a phone.  He laughs and shows me her number on his phone.  What? Now mind you, I have not told you what conversation we had on the train, but it wasn’t even remotely close to picking up, just general chat I thought.  Why even lie to me about that, much less give it to a friend who you have to know I will talk to eventually.  That’s just a straight slap in the face. Example 2: I’m at a blues club, in the bathroom.  A girl accidentally walks into the room, says she’s sorry and rushes out.  As I’m leaving the bathroom and heading back to me seat I see her on the way and decide that I can make a “clever” comment.  I tell her the bathroom is open is she wants’ to use it now.  She spins around and shouts out “I have a boyfriend.” So you’re getting the idea right? I’m obviously missing something here.  So there is your mass confusion

      Alright, two for today, but I had to get this one in sideways.  I was reading some recently updated blogs today as a break from work and I came across this little except:  "today is wesuck day! haha.. my classmate sent me dis sms abt vesak day.. haha.. didnt knew tt it was wesuck day until i woke up dis morning n checked e tv progs.. haha.. den was wondering.. y so many movies today.. heh.. quite blur ah.. did nthg much today.. quite bored.. was watching moviesss.. oh i watched dis damn grostesque Jap movie.. tink called wad battle royale.. heh.. though it was in jap n din hv any subtitles n i din knw wad e hell was going on.. e graphics tell it all.. haha.. its jus e killing of ppl here n there.. all fast killings man.. thrilling.. haha.. quite nice la.. oh.. n 'the day after tmr' n '50 first dates' downloading in progress.. haha.. shuang man.. heh.. did abit of work la.. really abit man.. jus cant get e engine going leh.. tmr also wun touch anything.. jialat.."  I’m going to leave the location unknown, but just look at this damn thing.  And worst of all, I think this just might have been intentional.  I mean, I’m not master grammar and spelling freak myself, but what the hell?  I felt like he was either talking in a different language, or had a hidden “translate” button on the page.  At second glance, neither of these was the case.  There appears to be a movie title in here and my best guess is that he was going incognito just in case the authorities came after him.  Now that’s all fine and good, but he’s apparently downloading 50 first dates.  Is that worth the bandwidth.  Drew Barrymore isn’t hot.  She has never been hot, and pardon me while I go on a rant here, but while your taking her out why not also take along, Cameron Diaz, Uma Therman (who the hell knows how she became a sex symbol?) and please oh please kill Mandy Moore.  Who the hell is that girl anyway? I’m of the opinion that the “industry” is playing this little game right now.  Some nasty people in a board room started this up a couple of years back and said “we can sell the masses anything we want and get them to agree that this is the best thing that ever happened to them; watch I can prove it!” And then they picked the most ugly and/or retarded people they could possible get on the screen ie Jessica Simpson.  Sure she’s hot, but hat enough to make up for that?  Alright, now I feel a little bit filthy.  It’s not right to judge other people, and to say these kinds of things about them, I just had to get it out you know?  It’s just my opinion.

      What if I told you I really had nothing to say this morning? Would you believe me?  Well as it turns out I do have something to say, and there… you just heard it.   Alright, so I was thinking about kids this morning.  Not that I even plan to have those little devils, but in a carrying thought from yesterday I began to think about how a child under my supervision would grow up.  I suppose the first question to ask is what gender.  You raise each gender a different way right.  Well I’m not so sure I would.  I think either way I would groom them in the garage and hope that they never decide they want to be a mechanic.  How would a child react when their first toy is a set of real wrenches, not even a play set?  Would they end up beating their siblings with the blunt object? Look at it this way, and I hate to admit this, but when I was a kid my parents bought me a toy kitchen with a complete set of canned foot items and dishes.  What the hell were they trying to do to me?! Did I escape that destiny out of will, or simply because it did not fit me and I would do as I was suppose to.  If that is the case, then I have nothing to worry about.  Both a happy and sad note there: I can do as I want, but what I do also has no effect.   So would I screw them up with all those things I learned over the years?  “Don’t tell people what you can do, show people what you can do.”  “If you’ve done something right it will probably go unnoticed.” “Love is for fools with the exception of me and your mother.” Etc etc. It’s actually kind of stupid to even think about it this way really.  I mean, the process will go on for the next 18 years or so; really more like 13 and then they go haywire.  And the plan needs to constantly change to match who that person is, how they respond.  Such as, giving them the wrench set.  If they love it, you get them a car on their 14th birthday to be fixed up for their 16th.  If they don’t, you get them a feather boa and high heeled shoes.  This applies to boa genders (just kidding, no girl of mine is going to be caught in a feather boa and high heel shoes, looking like a hussy! )   Alright, I think you’ve had enough.

      There is a lot to say this morning, and I probably won’t get through half of it.  It’s too bad though, because I feel there is a lot of life-relevant material in it.  I’ll begin with the weekend.  NitroGen is repaired and back on the road.  The new transmission, I’m going to give it about a week.  I don’t like it.  It does not shifty like my old one did, and unfortunately it’s still auto.  It also leaks a good amount more and has no off the line power.  Poor poor me. Had a LAN party this Friday.  A lot of fun.  I went to bed about 5 in the morning, woke up and they were still playing.  Went down to my dad’s house, came back a couple of hours later and they were still playing.  Now that’s dedication.  Then we went off to the Relay for Life.  Another all-nighter ensued. This is kind of where the story begins, well a part of it at least.  The Relay for Life is a walk for cancer.  It goes on the whole night, from 4 in the evening Saturday until 5:30 the next morning.  Well I knew a couple of the people who we walked with, but I didn’t know them all that well.  Really Mike and Zoya are the one’s who I can talk to.  None the less, in pairs of two, I won’t always be able to have a conversation with them.  I’m paired with a friend of marks’ a nice guy named Matt.  Well as the evening sets on Zoya of course warns everybody that only bullshit comes out of my mouth.  I couldn’t hold a regular conversation if my life depended on it.   This is actually true.  I can only talk about cars and computers, sometimes social interaction amused me.  Everything else is superfluous.  I cant’ even act like I’m interested.  Zoya attempted to give me lessons: nod your head every once in a while, say I agree or I disagree and offer a small bit of opinion etc etc.  Like it’s all easy to do that Zoya.  Offering a relevant opinion and agreeing or disagreeing requires that I was listening right? There is the flaw in your plan!!! So in any case, my walking partner seems a little afraid that we are not going to have anything to talk about.  I gave him a taste of the BS and it just flew right past him.  The same thing happens with Zoya, Mike loves the BS.  He’s willing to follow these logical paths from an illogical start, which is really what the BS is.  Here is a sample of what one of these starts would be: We need to decide which people are going to be assigned to which vehicles for our cross country paint ball tournament.  We need a team of our loyal friends in assignment of course. The vehicles we have are two motorcycles, two cars, two four wheel drive vehicles and a RV/Semi truck for repairs and command station.  We will run the gambit of what these vehicles need to have and how we would go about constructing these things, to who is best as the gunner underneath the four wheel drive mustang.  The conversation takes hours, is completely irrelevant, and is a lot of fun for us.  This works for the two of us, I think, because we both have a love for technology and invention that others seem to be missing. So Matt is not like this.  Matt is gay; and you’ll see why this becomes relevant in a short while.  Being that I could not BS with Matt on this same level, I decided that I would go deeper into my own personal thoughts.  The kinds of views that you might see here.  He knew the kinds of comments that I made.  The typical red-blooded American comments that are so erroneous and stupid.  Well I love to make these kind of comments; more than that, I like to try and justify them.  He figured I love cars; I love red meat; Conan the Barbarian was a good movie because there was nothing to think about, he just killed people and ravaged women so on and so forth.  This would not be the kind of person that he would enjoy talking to.  Therefore I would have to show him that I was an open minded person.  Which I am to a certain extent. We somehow got started on the subject of musicals.  I made the comment that I hated musicals.  He made the joking comment that he was just beginning to like me too.  So I explained that I really actually did like musicals, opera, plays and the whole lot; that I had done things like this throughout high school, and then at the end of it realized that I had somehow been tricked onto the whole thing because I could not fit in any other way than with oddball theatre people, who seemed just as dissociated as I was.   I furthered this by explaining that I like to say things that are of an extreme viewpoint, but the reality is in the things that I do.  I claim that I hate children, but if you have ever seen me with them you could tell that I actually do love them.  I love their innocence, their ability to love and treat a total stranger as if they were part of the family.  Something that I cannot do.  I claim that I only love meat, but in truth I see nothing wrong with any other food.  Sure I a great steak, but who doesn’t.  I never complain about a vegetation or even a vegan (well at least not in their eating habits).  Then there are cars.  I explained before that everybody believes I hate anything that is not classic American.  No, I love cars, and that’s it. He was satisfied with this opinion, and already a good hour had passed in our walk.  We were set to walk for a half hour and decided to continue on with the conversation instead.  I began to walk through the “trials” of my life in a giant monologue when we began talking about daily tensions.  I explained that I may not always be happy, but I am a satisfied person.  I told him about the history of the car, my dad’s relationships, my mom, siblings and so on.  This again lasted for hours.  The conclusion of the conversation seemed to be once again that what does not kill you makes you stronger.  Mind you that was not said because that’s cliché and stupid, but basically.  We are not shaped by the good moments, we are shaped by the bad, with a hope for the good.  What enacts change and evolution of tragedy and crisis.  That is why my favorite Shakespeare is Titus Andronicus.  There is so much emotions that the character is forced to change, and even in that change he is crushed.  There is no hope, there is no future.  That is drama! We ended up having a great time walking together. I stayed off the bullshit and Matt didn’t have to fear the lack of conversation.  So did I change, did Zoya actually teach me something that night? Well sorry friends, but I already knew how to do this.  I can hold a conversation when I want to; but there is one key for me.  I do have to be genuinely interested, and I will not fake it.  I have never said ask e no question I’ll tell you no lies.  I invite the questions, and you will find the right me, but you may not always find it in the words.

      For me, one of the greatest compliments to receive is “You’ve changed.”  Good or bad, you’re unexpected and it’s noticeable.  I think this as I look back on my past… yes again.  I began by thinking about how nice a young boy I was, such high aspirations for the future, the need to be loved and the ability to love myself as well as others. So that lasted for all of about 10 more seconds when suddenly I realized something.  I was never a nice young man.  I was mean as hell.  Think about those mean little grade school kids you may have seen; the ones that make fun of the others, push others around on the playground acting all tough; like they have some kind of power over the others.  That was me.  I can remember one girl in particular.  My friends and I made fun of her to no end.  I mean out and out mean.  She certainly didn’t deserve it! She never fought back, hell, the girl barely ever even talked.  She just had a poor family living in the “poor part” of Joliet.  Now that’s fricking poor! Did I forget about that part? My inability to stop lying about anything and everything as a kid.  I look back sometimes and think about how much closer I was to God back then.  In a certain respect it was true.  I was more naïve back then.  I wasn’t about to question anything.  Now I know the world, I’ve heard the arguments, and I have questioned my beliefs.  I have come back from the grave in a certain sense, and I think because of that I’m even closer than ever before.   Now it means something to me. And love? I never loved myself.  I’m not sure it’s possible.  You ask yourself was it love or was it the thought of being in love.  I know the answer when it applies to me, and that’s all I know.  They say trust in the creator, the wisdom that created you.  I trust in that wisdom, I just sometimes hate what I do with it. In grade school I was part of a kids gang.  We would go around and beat the hell out of other kids in the neighborhood.  I can remember once my friend getting beat up on his paper route by another group of kids.  These were grade school kids with the word ‘Ozzy’ cut into their knuckles.  I kid you not.  I set up club houses in abandoned buildings, lied, cheated and stole.   I asked myself the other day what made me change, what turned me into this cynical asshole who wants the world at a bargain price? What created this evil? Today I’m going to ask just the opposite though.  What was it that saved me from all that? What gave me the second chance at becoming a good guy?  Can I change?

      The skies are ceasing to part today in more ways than one.  Yes ladies and gentlemen, there are more problems.  Good news, there is a spare transmission laying around.  Bad news, it’s been laying around for some time now. It’s our only home.  Why? Because all of a sudden we’re going to need to pinch every single penny that we can.  For me? No, for my dad.  I’m on the rise, but unfortunately not on the rise fast enough to save the most impulsive of our family. Why do bad things happen to good people.  It was a couple of years back now.  I was over at DePaul, scraping by on what little I had.  Most of the time it was credit cards which seemed to have infinite wealth.  Finals were coming up when I got a call from my dad.  Not that this was an unusual thing, but it became apparent that he was in trouble.  Due to some undelivered mail he had failed to pay his mortgage for the past 6 months. This didn’t stop him from spending; he figured it was extra cash.  Now he was faced with paying it off with interest… immediately.  I did what I could, and it wasn’t much.  I went to the bank with a credit card and took out a cash advance.  The next day, now getting more ill due to the fact that I could not sleep during finals week, I went back and got another cash advance.  This went on for days as I got worse and worse looking.  On the last day I went to the bank, dressed in black, glasses to hide my tired and bloodshot eyes. I handed them card after card as they told me that each of them had reached their limit and no, I could not use my debit card as a credit card.  I applied for another card and was turned down.  Pretty much I looked like a drug fiend looking to get one last fix.  Whatever happened, it was enough, and the bills got paid.  I am still trying to recover from those bills today, paying them off little by little at an incredible interest rate. Now the interest rate would not be so bad if it were not for one thing.  My dad, who has quite a few cards in my name now.  One of which he forgot to pay for a period of 3 months.  Suddenly I was being charged at 30%.  It took me months to get them even remotely back in order. So now we have one more impass.  My dad is retiring; and with it , he will be required to pay in to get the full retirement amount.  What preparations have been made, none. Yes we have many cars; yes they could go for some good money.  But they would go for about twice as much with a little work.  My dad needs quite a bit of money, and he needs it soon.  If I did have anything left it still would not be enough though.  What am I to do.  Do I sink in everything I have left to help the man who has built the love of my life with me, or do I realize that I just don’t have the power; that this time he’s going to have to pay for his own mistakes. This is a very hard time for me.  Just when things were starting to look brighter for me I have something that could shove me back into fi9nacial ruin.  Does he even care?  What did he think I was complaining about when I said “If you don’t quit buying crap off of ebay I’m smash the damn computer!”. I’m sure you know that this is just one side of the story, and so I don’t want to paint my dad as this evil man consumed by impulse.  That’s just my opinion… right now.  He’s also a genius when it comes to ingenuity.  If I had the money and I didn’t have to worry about it I would probably hand it over and tell him to consider it a gift.  I would consider myself lucky, and the price well worth it.  But I can’t do that; I’m going to have to be selfish this time. And it's killing me.

      Usually it’s in the morning that I write these, but Blogspot was seemingly down until now.  Perhaps it’s better that way, I’ve had some time to think, and certainly much to do this morning. So I’ve decided it’s about season for the time honored tradition of the “burncycle”.  Not something that I do very often; it can actually be rather dangerous, and the crash at the end could cost me a good amount of time in recovery. So what is a burncycle?  While the rest of you slept last night I sat awake in bed, dreaming my dreams awake.  The last couple of days have been rather rough.  I’m out a transmission; I’ve lost my favorite mp3 player; deadlines are past due and people want more than I can offer both in and out of work.  What do you do when you fall on times like these.   I’ll tell you what I used to do: I used to fold.  I accept that things are impossible, I salvage what I can and I get out.  This still relates to relationships, but somehow not to the rest of my life.  Now I figure I’m going headstrong until I break or break through everything.  I will sleep mind you, just not a whole lot.  It’s time to concentrate, put forward every last bit of what I have and die trying. They say that the true you comes out when you’re in the squeeze; when you have nobody to turn to, nothing to give you hope.  Well hope is something you give yourself, and when it comes down to it you were always alone within yourself anyway.  Isn’t that what Isaac Asimov once said: that we were so alone that we divided ourselves into man and woman.  Well I’m sure he said it much better but that’s the gist of it.   What I’m saying right now is that I will still not be beaten, the same way I said when I was feeling good, I can say now when I feel bad. It I couldn’t I would consider myself to be untrue.  I may not be a brilliant man, I may not have what it takes to make it very far, but a man who can’t stand by his own words… well now… that’s just disgusting.

      Well looks like the joke is on me.  After yesterdays little fiasco I complemented myself on a well running car that had just sweated out a long and hard drive back home in rush hour.  Well ladies and gentlemen; all is not good in the land of Roguen.  This morning the automatic transmission would not come out of second gear without a good romp on the gas.  Does this mark the end of transmission 6? Well we’re going to have to see about that.  The options are weighing in this morning as I contemplate my next day of work.  I had to steal a car this morning to make it here, but that’s only going to last a week, then the owner comes home .  Those options are: 1)	Reactivate Super R Type for a short stint as my summer car  Downfall: It breaks down more than anything 2)	New T56 transmission.  This was slated for later this year possibly. Downfall: I have not set aside the money for this yet, and the parts will probably take a month to arrive, much less the time it takes to install.  Mind you this is not just a trans swap.  Because this engine is balanced internally I will need to take it apart and rebalance the crank for the new flywheel.   3)	Another C4 transmission.  It costs less and can boot right up. Downfall: I am sick and tired of these stupid auto transmissions.  Did I mention there were 5 before this one.  Obviously they can’t take the strain of daily driving.  Still, this means a quick recovery for the car. 4)	Find out some way to just keep this thing going for a little longer.  I don’t know what it is, but I need to find it, and within the length of today. Now for all you critics out there.  You could tell me that I should really get a car that I can rely on.  I’ve been hearing that for the past 10 years thank you very much.  That will not be happening.  Recognize the symbiotic relationship that I have with this car.  If the car is surrendered, Roguen will die.  I am serious.  At least to the point of this personality.  Without it, I don’t even exist, it gave me my name.  So please spare a couple of wasted words here and ask yourself the question: Do you surrender your dreams or your trust?

      I decided that today might be a good day to kind of reflect on the web log process itself.  What has become of this little project to put my inner thoughts into the “public”? Well I think all things considered it’s gone pretty well.  Sure, I didn’t go handing out the address to everybody who I knew.  There are probably fewer than 6 or 8 as a matter of fact that actually do no me.  That’s a good and a bad thing.  It’s good, because people reading this who do not know me, well what do they care right? I’m just some guy with a blog. To the others though I feel it is becoming a daily one sided conversation with them.  They might also contend that this is how it usually is too, but that would require that I listen to them now wouldn’t it? So for all you out there who I do not know, I think this little note is for you.  You read this blog and you judge me just a little bit right? I’m even going to go out on a limb here and say that you don’t even like me right? You think that if you ran into me, you would probably put me in my place.  That may all be very right I’m sure.  But think about the people that I do know.  I do have friends; hell some people even like me.  What could be the reasoning behind that? Is it because I’m a good looking guy? It couldn’t be, think of all the good looking assholes who you know and dislike.  They did not get by on looks alone; may have scored them some moments, but it didn’t last forever.  Is it because I’m an extremely kind person? I mean, come on, you’ve been reading the blog, you tell me. What does it come down to? Perhaps the fact that people can see past the angry decisions, the walls that I’ve put up.  Either that, or they just explain it to themselves that way and it makes them feel better.  The truth doesn’t matter actually.   So why not you then? Perhaps I’m a poor writer.  Well I’ll tell you, my good friend who just happens to be a college professor now (yes you) happens to think that I write a damn good blog now and again.  She even teaches philosophy.  That’s high praise, but unfortunately bias.  You see, she already knows me.  She can just barely comprehend how people could take things I say the wrong way.  She looks on me with a friends eyes and says, “it’s good he’s stretching out with these thoughts” rather than “Who the hell thinks these things and still considers themselves sane?” That would be you. So here’s the thing.  I want to hear from you this time.  I want to know what the feelings really are.  I want to know it there is someone out there listening.  Critique or complement, whichever you want, but don’t forget that I too can judge, and I will.

      Alright, I know I said this day really sucked, but something just happened that might have made up for the whole thing.   It's the perfect end to a horrible day, you are kind of forced to stay at work late, rather than leaving extra early as planned.  This on top of having no music and feeling ill.  You get on the highway late and still find it packed balls to the wall, right as you get on. I  went towards the first exit and it didn't take long until Gen was feeling just a little bit too hot for my liking.  I pulled over to the side of the road and thought, forget about this, I can wait it out.  Now I did mention that I left the power adapter at home, so no laptop, but I always have a supply of magazines for just such and occasion.  That selection would include: Jeg's Mail Order, Maxim and/or Stuff magazine, and my 2600 quarterly.   I sat back and relaxed, foot out the window as people went by.  I knew what they were thinking, and to be honest I did feel a little embarrassed at times.  I mean, sure when your on the side of the road people might feel am little sorry for you, but in my car I get more the feeling there thinking, haha, bet he thought he was al hot just 2 seconds ago. They would be right in this case, but screw them anyhow. You might think it would be better to shout at everyone passing by: “I’m sitting here of my own free will, not because I broke down. You’re the suckers”. That is really really lame though.  Instead I thought of it more as a test.  Sure, they can think what they want, but in the end my engine still runs at the end of the day; I still drive this car tomorrow when there is no traffic. So where does the good part come in? Well I was just getting to that.  I was sitting for a while mind you.  I could have sworn there was a traffic accident on the exit ramp because people were not moving an inch.  Then this big 4 door extended cab bright and shin new F150 pulls up next to me.  Full of hot women? Nah, full of guys looking over and laughing.  “Dude, sucks to be you.” They proclaimed as they sat right next to me.  I lowered my foot and leaned out the window.  “When your driving your car instead of your mom’s truck why don’t you come and let me know whose life sucks.”  With that I put the keys back in the ignition, started her up and pulled in front of that truck.  It took awhile, but I got home, and the wait was well worth it in my opinion.

      I know it’s a bad day already.  Hell, it’s just been a rotten weekend, and this was in spite of the great  weather.  Why is it rotten today, because I don’t have enough time to really even be typing this and I forgot the power adapter for my laptop back at the house.  That means no music, and I program to music. 	So, on a grander scale, what about his weekend.  Went to a friends barbeque; had a good time; no confrontations.  That’s all well in good, but I ran into this girl I had gone on a couple of dates with before.  She was cute then, now she was downright hot.  Sucks to be me right? Well, not like I gave her the cold shoulder before, not like we were on bad terms at all.  She was simply away and we lost contact over time.  That’s the way it goes.  Now she’s gorgeous and has  boyfriend, what kind of guy wouldn’t like a girl like her.  That dog. 	Anyhow, it really made me feel bad for some reason though, and I’ve been trying to figure out why.  I felt bad even before I knew she had a boyfriend.  I felt bad the moment I laid eyes on her and said this girl looks 10 times as good as she did when I last saw her.  I guess it makes me mad to know that I’m superficial too.  I wondered if she had looked like this before, would I have tried a little harder? I decided the ultimate answer was no.  The reasoning was even more disturbing to me. 	Why wouldn’t I try harder?  I have a flaw; yes ladies and gentlemen; even me.  I can’t date hot women, hell I even have a hard time looking at them.  My self-esteem is that low.  I don’t want to get mixed up with hot women because they make me do bad things; make a fool of myself.  I bring them flowers; write stupid notes, etc etc.  All that crap that’s going to up and have your man card taken straight out of your hands. 	It all goes back to Amy, that girl that I loved so much. I thought she was hot, and so I did all those aforementioned things.  I even walked into her classroom to sing for her on Valentines Day.  The best and worst thing I have ever done.  Best for about a week; worst for the rest of my life.  I’m not going to get into it right now but it comes down to this, do something for a girl that she remembers like that and she will come back some day and hunt you down.  She felt I was the sweetest guy she ever knew, that put the weight of man’s future on my shoulders.  All she had to do was prove that I was like any other guy and the planets were back in alignment for her.   	So I’ve sworn off hot girls.  They can do nothing for me.  They only suit my pride, and ruin the rest of me.  Lesson here: If you want to be happy for the rest of your life, make an ugly woman your wife.  Lol.  They should make a song about that or something.

      All we want is a head rush All we want is to get out of our skin for awhile We have nothing to lose because we don’t have anything Anything we want anyway… We used to hate people Now we just make fun of them It’s more effective that way We don’t live We just scratch on day to day With nothing but matchbooks and sarcasm in our pockets And all we’re waiting for it is for something worth waiting for Let’s admit America gets the celebrities we deserve Let’s stop saying “don’t quote me” because if none quotes you You probably haven’t said a thing worth saying We need something to kill the pain of all that nothing inside We all just want to die a little bit We fear that pop-culture is the only kind of culture we’re ever going to have We want to stop reading magazines Stop watching TV Stop caring about Hollywood But we’re addicted to the things we hate We don’t run Washington and no one really does Ask not what you can do for your country Ask what your country did to you The only reason your still alive us because someone Has decided to let you live We owe so much money we’re not broke we’re broken We’re so poor we can’t even pay attention So what do you want? You want to be famous and rich and happy But your terrified you have nothing to offer this world Nothing to say and no way to say it But you can say it in three languages You are more than the sum of what you consume Desire is not an occupation You are alternately thrilled and desperate Sky-high and fucked Let’s stop praying for someone to save us and start saving ourselves Let’s stop this and start over Let’s go out Let’s keep going This is your life This is you fucking life We need something to kill the pain of all that nothing inside Quit whining you haven’t done anything wrong because frankly  You haven’t done much of anything Someone’s writing down your mistakes Someone’s documenting your downfall  -KMFDM

      “There is a very good reason why you have to fear the man who just keeps his anger in.  It’s not healthy, it tears a man up inside.  I’m one of those kinds of people and so I’ll tell you this:” mind you this is one of those things you never say out loud to anybody... ever, “The reason you don’t blow up instantly is that it allows you the chance to pull back and think a little more about the situation.  If you still find this anger uncontrollable, you kill ‘em and nobody is the wiser.  Why? Because you have never been seen getting into a scuffle with this person, and there is no reason to think that you would make a jump from slightly dismayed to cold blooded killer.” Now that’s some sound advice! Another person you are not going to see me talking to any more.

      I came in this morning with a singular thought, what a sad lot we are.  You can lose in love or you can lose in love, either way you lose.  I picked up my brother from the airport last night.  He was depressed.  He went out to see his, well girlfriend if you want to call her that.  He was distressed about the amount of time he was allowed to spend with her.  Both of them would be going back to the war this week, the place where they had met on their first tour.  This time they would most likely not see each other however.  He lamented the pain of feelings that he had, cursed his own expectations in a relationship: they were the things that killed you, the expectation that when you put something in you get it back right there.  It made me think again, and for the majority of you, you can skip past the whole rest of this entry, I think I have gone over it a thousand times before. I’m a person without expectation.  The world has molded me into a die hard pessimist over time.  Sad to think right? Well I don’t.  I prayed to God for years, “Give me love or take the hunger away from me.” It’s God’s answer to a prayer.  Well whether you want to debate that or not is up to you, but on your time please.  It would be hard to explain if I didn’t go through a couple situations, so I’ll give that a try.  A good friend of mine and I have a very good relationship.  You could say that she’s about as close to me as I let anybody in this world.  More that that, I care about her, she makes me happy.  She and I did have a couple of run-ins.  We go out on a date now and again, but I never expect anything to come of it.  After one night in particular she was a little worried that I might have some expectations of the relationship.  She called me a couple of days later to see what was up.  Of course as far as I was concerned, nothing had changed between us.  She was relieved to find this out.  It was that lack of expectation that kept us together.  I don’t demand a thing from her.  I enjoy talking to her.  I love going out with her, but there simply isn’t anything more.  Perhaps if Stephanie had realized this that relationship would have lasted a little bit longer right? So why does this work? Well it does and it doesn’t.  The lack of expectation brings with it the lack or responsibility; ie: I give freely as long as I know I don’t have to give forever.  Like most women claim of men, I am afraid of commitment.  Why don’t you just reap the benefits though? I could go out to a club with a girl, have her dance with another guy and not think twice about the whole thing.  Sure I might be a little upset if she runs off with that guy for the night, but the likelihood of that happening with a girl I’m actually dating is kind of slim, and if she did, she’s a jerk anyway, and that would be the end of it right?   My brother asked what had happened to me that made me this way.  He knows I’m an internal person, like my father before me.  So was there a particular situation? Well yes and no.   I can remember some of the big hitters.  80X, the reincarnation of Amy, came back some years ago to kill Rob with the past.  She took him out to a club with her.  Unfortunately Rob’s expectations for the relationship were a bit too high.  The night before he proclaimed to me, “I made the mistake of letting her go before, that won’t happen this time.”  He left the dance floor for a minute for the bathroom, when he returned there was already a guy buying a drink for his girl.  He watched from afar as they sat down and talked.  Finally he couldn’t take it anymore and walked away from the floor.  After some time she found him again in one of the empty booths on the other side.  He felt it was right to express his opinion on the matter.  He told her he didn’t like what he saw going on.  The damn fool had become jealous and was helpless to resist.  She didn’t understand of course.  The guy had just bought her a drink and they talked, nothing more.  Rob called her shallow for not understanding.  All hell broke loose.  She was not amused and the conversation shut down.  Nothing more he said could penetrate the cold steel. She knew that she had him; she knew that she could destroy him.  And she laid in that final blow.  He apologized for his remark.  The devastating thought of losing her forever suddenly kicked in and he gasped for breath.  She looked down at him and let him just die right there.   That was where I found him.  He told me the whole story again and again, as if the firs time would not have been enough for me.  The gravity of it seemed to sink into my soul.  I couldn’t stop thinking about it for days as I nursed him back to health.  He never did fully recover from that night.  Paralyzed, he only makes commentary her and there, has the feeling that there is seldom anyone listening to him.  He’s right to  certain degree, I realize that thoughts like his are dangerous if followed.  He was a fool to think he could have held onto her.  He was looking at the past, trying to simply skip the part where he had dumped her so cruelly looking for the world.  He expressed feelings of incomplete thoughts, no rational to back up his argument; and furthermore he was a very bad debater.  When the truth hit him, he let it hit him like a ton of bricks.  No bone would be spared.   This is the lesson that I learned from him; him mostly, but from so many others. I do what I say, I say what I do, and whole the rest of you claim that this is the end of your life in relationships because of bad experience, why don’t you take a little time to evaluate what you say, and before the words come out of our mouth make sure that your going to follow up.  I am sick and tired of the opposite.  So sick and tired that I will listen to the words that I say.  I will take the advice of others when I see good reason, and reject it when I see it being an emotional response.  That advice to me was self awareness: know who you are before you go out into the world that most certainly wants you to weep and grovel before it takes your head; the world that most certainly wants you dead.

             I’ve been working a very long week, 14 hours today alone.    I’ve come home to get some sleep and head back to work again for another 14 hours most likely.    But I can’t sleep.    I’m tired, but I really felt like this memory had to go somewhere.     I’m laying awake thinking about a single day back in junior high.    A friend of mine was out in gym class and didn’t put enough hustle into his step chasing down a softball.    He ends up missing it and an aggravated member of his team, considered even at that time to be a jock, informed him that he was unhappy, and followed by a slap across the face.     I wasn’t in that same gym class; I only found my friend crying at his locker, disgraced by this asshole.     I can’t say it anymore, but at the time I had never hated one person, one kind of thing so much in my life, and it was this other guy.     My friends and I were just barely noticeable in the school population.    People didn’t make fun of us, we were not popular; we coasted.    Well at least I did. This friend might have had a little more trouble sometimes I guess.         I remember seeing this guy the next day in the halls, Dale Hicks was his name.    He went on to play football for high school, probably thought himself quite the player in many respects.    This man will never have my respect however.    When I saw him that next day I felt like walking right up to him, in my “names of Jesus” tee shirt and handing his own medicine back to him in the form of my own hand.    I didn’t of course, I’m a coward.    I live with that day more often than you might expect.    I think about it an abnormal amount of time for something that would seemingly be so insignificant, and tonight it keeps me awake.    No triggering event that I can think of.     I think back over the situation, and what I should have done on that day.    What would have happened to me?    I went to grade school on   Joliet  , where there was some real criminal behavior; of which I witnessed.    Could these suburban gangsta wannabes do any worse than some of the things I had seen?    Well I do have a low threshold for pain, and I had an even lesser threshold for tension.    Amazing how the times have changed.     I would like to say this right now, and perhaps some day my long lost friend   Chad   will hear it.    There will never be another moment like this before my eyes again.    The next time that I see a guy like that I’m going to hand him his ass on a silver platter.         My only hope is that the next time I see it happen… it’s not me.

      We’ve all kind of split off into our own little hobbies.    I have been spending my time concentrating on getting rid of those little bad habits; biting the inside of my mouth; chewing fingernails, sniffling.    Roguen has been locked inside the garage for about a week now.    Sometimes I’ll hear shouts of anger, other times shouts of revelation.    I figure he’s doing alright; And Ron? Well he’s just working on keeping his big mouth shut.    He claims he has no speech preprocessor and cannot help the fact that he speaks his mind.    That excuse doesn’t make any of this any less embarrassing.     So we have all fallen under criticism as of recent for our combined attitude.    I used to think it was just Ron’s fault, but it’s not, it’s all of us.    I sometimes think that people do not realize what it takes to survive.    If you want to keep something fragile from breaking, you wrap it in material that will resist the pressures of the outside.    Well I’m not happy to say it, but I may be that fragile piece and it’s Ron who does the protecting.    When it was just Rogue and I it was a little bit different.    He didn’t think that protection was the answer.    At the time he didn’t believe he would be around forever.    He believed that the answer was to show me how to change, be a little more like him; enough to protect myself.           He stopped that line of thought after awhile though.    I can’t tell you exactly why, but I have some thoughts.    Ron had different ideas when he came in though.    He surmised that changing something was just as bad as breaking it in the first place.    Much easier for me to do right?    As he explained it Rogue’s theory that you became harder to protect from the enemy also made you the enemy; made you cold; and did not satisfy.           Last week there seemed to be a regime change around here.    Roguen suddenly didn’t look as monolithic and indestructible as he once was.    It was like someone had just struck him in the Achilles heel really.    He resigned to focus himself better and reform those old dogmas that he had been clinging to so tightly these past few years.           I have some fears right now, I won’t lie about that, it’s not the place.    But I’m also not sure it’s the proper time for them to be conveyed.    Perhaps down the road, and soon.

         In light of recent events Roguen has decided to take a little break from his blogging and has handed the reigns over to me for just a short time being.    This could be as long as the start of the new year.           You might think that I’m a new person here, but in truth I’ve ghost written a couple of posts previous, but it’s much easier to really free my words when I’m wrapped in my own character.    I think it’s also appropriate that I introduce ‘Ron’.    He’s another co writer on occasion, but hasn’t really decided to make his own account up as of yet.    I’m really kind of hoping that he doesn’t.   j/k           So on with the blog:     I ran into some old friends from back in high school the other day.    Not just high school, but early high school.    They recognized me right away.    They claimed that I hadn’t changed a bit since my freshmen year.    You would think this was an isolated case, but unfortunately I am all too recognizable by just about everybody I have ever hung out with.    It would seem that if I have changed in appearance, it wasn’t much.    People often mistake my younger brother for being older than me.       Of course I always tell them that it’s the anti aging cream, but I’m starting to wonder if there might be another reason: love life.           This is a lame brained theory I know, but stay with me.    My dad’s side of the family has this thing for going through life unmarried.    Out of the three kids in their family, only he has been married, and married and married.    The other two fell in love, came close, but never took that final step.    How they live there lives now I don’t really know; the contact is sparse between us; but I can tell you that they look fairly young for their age.    If fact my uncle looks like a little more chubby version of my dad about 10 years younger, which is quite a feet considering my dad doesn’t look all that old himself.     Case 2: my great aunt who never got married.    She turned 82 this last month and looks younger and healthier that most 60 year olds.    Unlike most of her age she has perfect sign, hearing and function throughout.    Is this a coincidence?       Case 3: my brothers.    Both my old brother and 1 younger brother look older than I do.    Both have been in relationships where they were left heartbroken at times, loved and lost, tried but ended up with nothing for their efforts.    Both myself and my youngest brother John, who is also considered “unlucky” in love, have not aged for years.        I think the key is the aggravation that comes with a relationship.    Perhaps it’s the extreme pleasure, most likely it is the extreme pain and aggravation that does this to a person; the threat of losing something and holding on too tight! I like to think that I hold on loosely but I don’t let go.    There is a place where the price is too high, but it’s a very high price and I’m doing my best not to reach it.       So end lesson: Look at your loving partner and ask yourself today.    Are the ageing toxins on this relationship really worth it? Every day I spend with this person I am one day older and I look two.

      Rogue makes a steady recovery from the other day.  Today he even made claims to it being “just a small setback”.  Indeed, in light of recent advances it would seem only a slight setback.  I still don’t think it fully undoes the damage though.    Good news: almost as if set into motion by some higher power, a peek at Ebay revealed the sale of a 1978 Lincoln Versailles.  Buy it now price of $500.  You and I may think that this car is a boat, and it’s true.  Very much like a Delta 88 or something like that.  Rogue knows better though, and some of you cars might know as well: The Versailles is not a regular car; it just happens to have a ford 9 inch rear end, one of the toughest built.  It also has a very coveted disc break system; one that muscle car enthusiasts will pay thousands to get their greedy little hands on.  The axle will fit up nicely on a 1968 mustang by chance.  Coincidence? Take into account that the listing was made a half hour before we checked with a buy it now.  The car has been sitting in a shopping mall parking lot for some time now and they decided that it needed to be sold or toed away.  This is a ridiculously rich coincidence! Rogue is quite happy.  T56 arrived today.  There was some dispute over what it actually had in terms of gear ratio, HP rating and all.  None would be bad, but some would be better than others.  For the price we were not expecting too much out of this one.  It was going for about half the price of others.  Turns out it’s the 020 model.  For those of you who are not Tremec fans, this means a .5 to 1 final gear ratio.  A horse power rating of 450.  This makes this the undisputed heavyweight of the T56 transmissions for Rogue.  It can handle the most power and has the highest gearing available, meaning he can put a much lower gear in the rear end.  The transmission was so clean when it arrived he claimed that you could clean it with your tongue.  He was restrained.  Once again… coincidence?  In one fell swoop the tables has “seemingly” turned.  NitroGen will be outfitted with a super manual transmission, a lower geared rear end and the stopping power to hand it, giving it an official new version upon completion.  By the end it seems very likely that Gen is going to need a wheelie bar.

      I saw a row or ducks crossing a 6 lane highway this morning. When they reached the median in the middle they turned around to cross again.  Morning; and traffic is building.  Most of the backup is due to the fact that everyone has stopped to allow this row of ducks to pass.  Made me think that we are so much like that row of ducks.  There are such big nasty things that loom over us; just a mistake and we could be vanquished, but we prevail.  Also made me think about how stupid that lead duck was.  Where the hell did he think he was leading them, and then back again!  We don’t survive because we’re smart, at least most of the time.  We survive because the pity of the world allows us to live another day.  Rogue has been allowed to live another day, but not without injury, and he’s running on empty.  I’ll be taking care of things for him today.  The others are not going to get the real story, but you will, I have deemed you worthy.  The car is once again in the garage.  On the way home, one block away from the house the rear end locked up suddenly.  The car dragged the wheel home and there it has been sitting ever since.  Further examination shows that unfortunately it’s not the transmission (as Rogue had rather hoped: The T-56 has just arrived!) instead it is the rear end.  His beautiful 9’ limited slip 3.50 gear rear-end.  It’s not the brakes, it’s something much more sinister, and today we shall find out.  A rebuild is inevitable.    Bad news, there go the bragging rights of a full summer of NitroGen.  But the bad news is far outweighed by optimism.  The lockup occurred eerily close to the house.  Could have happened anywhere, could have been on the highway; could have caused a very bad accident if it had occurred there while Rogue was driving along at mach speeds.  He and I agree that this is a blessing.  Other is that the t56 was going to wait until winter.  Rogue’s watering mouth was beginning to foam when the transmission was purchased.  Now perhaps it will be installed before the summer is out.  Pending a quick repair of the rear-end, it could be less than a month.  In the mean time the Opel GT is on route as a replacement.  My brother was gracious enough to supply the car in the meantime, and at very short notice.  We’ll only need it until the end of the week I’m sure.    Why is this the truth, what is not? Well, only those who need to know around here are going to know.  Already the regular calls for the car’s destruction/sale have been called for.  Calls for blood Rogue likes to think.  The stories are good, but there are far too many of them these days.  The car is a thing of pride as well and hence Rogue is injured.  One thing remains however: This is not the end.  The car cannot be destroyed.  It shall rise from its own grave once again.  Rogue would never allow this to happen.  He will not fail, it’s all the heart he has left.

      My brother left this morning for his second tour in Iraq.  Doesn’t get any easier to say goodbye; always hit you right at the end when you’re waving goodbye to the bus.  You can’t help but wonder if this could be the last time you see your little brother, even though he should be in a safe position; it’s still war.  My Mom cried for hours and hours, I help my tears back as much as possible… Guess maybe I do still have a heart somewhere.  The ride to work this morning was strangely different, not even the thrill of driving and some White Zombie could break the mood.  He said that he thought it he wasn’t going into aeronautics he might try being a police officer or firefighter.  Guess when your in a job where you might get killed somehow it doesn’t seem to matter as much looking at others.  I wonder which is more dangerous, being a police officer in the city, or being a soldier in the war.  At least somebody likes you when you’re a soldier right? This week I’m going to continue writing my little novel.  I can see this little event making it in there somehow.

      It’s cold.  That is the only reason I need.  Everything else is just the details.  Here are the details:  Because the winter is cold things tend not to overheat.  My car is one of these things.  And the other, well that’s me.  Right about now though my car is very cool and I am about to tell patience to take a hike as I smash everything in this world that fails to work exactly the way I would like it too.  One of these things is continuus.  Who the hell came up with this development “database” and why the hell are we not using CVS or even sourcesafe at this point.  I spend more of my day reconciling and synchronizing with the repository than I do coding.  I have things to do here too ladies and gentlemen.  I may be a good programmer, but they don’t write themselves for the love of god.  The second is the bathrooms here.  By the looks of it you would think they had spent a lot of money.  Even the hand soap is automatic.  Well what happens when you stick your hands under the faucet, you get these intermittent shots of water to “clean” your hands.  Keep them moving though or the water shuts off again and again and again.  That and this whole place smells like a dump.  Perhaps instead of putting in an automatic air freshener they should in ventilation! What is the problem with that?  I realize it’s a large building with several floors, but they do it everywhere else.  I feel like ripping out the faucet with my bare hands, throwing this monitor into a wall and finding the makers of said repository and tossing them out a window.  And believe it or not I haven’t even gotten red hot yet.  Just wait until the code doesn’t compile.  But I wouldn’t be getting hot if this was the middle of winter.

      How true are you? Is there somebody in your life who you refrain from telling the truth? In a thought related to my last post I want you to think about this.  I know you, and there is somebody who your hiding from.  You might tell your friends, you might tell the one you love, but if you can’t tell everyone, and that includes family, is it true?  I may have made a mistake in my judgment but I have always felt it best to litmus test my feelings with my family.  Since I was in high school and really felt that I started having some opinions that were my own I would let them know how I felt, the “darker” thoughts of my head.  This unfortunately led to my near institutionalization and of course the medication that was going to help me.  I might have thought I was a bad ass, but I could not be sure until I related that same feeling to my parents and they said “you my son… are a bad-ass”.  Example, street racing: When I would get home I would let them know how I blew the doors off if so and so.  They seldom told me that they were disappointed actually.  They would not even say “hey that’s your choice”.  But they made the point that when things went wrong I was going to be the one who had to clean it up.  With that in mind the racing stopped.  Here is the real point I’m trying to make here though.  My parents do know who I am to as certain a degree as I can give anyone else I know.  When asked why I had never joined the Marines like my two younger brothers my dad said they would have rejected me based on my mental instability.  Not sure if he was joking about that one?  Still, for me the truth is in what I am not afraid to show anyone, at least that’s what my opinion is right now.  I can think in my head that I’m a romantic person that I care and I’m loving and all that kind of garbage, but once again, the proof is in what actually came out.  If you have never done a romantic thing for your girl/guy, then I’m sorry Cyrano, but you’re just not a romantic person. Now back to your regularly scheduled program

      So you’ve been here for a little while right? You know what happens when you type in a new address and hit the go button/enter.  All these new places, new ideas; the freedom of the internet.  Well let me burst that little bubble of your and tell you that the internet is not all it’s cracked up to be.  It’s still made up of the same people who you walk around with in the real world, only now… their in bazarro world!  All that stuff that counted while you were topside, it don’t mean Jamaican jerk chicken here.  I’m not saying it’s a bad thing really, it’s even refreshing and novel for a time, but that’s not going to last forever.  It runs out when you find that you can be as cool as you want to be in life/in your head, but here you don’t get respect from anybody. Why so? Well in the real world we see people.  When we tell them their fat and ugly we reap the reward of seeing their face become angry or sad.  Mind you reward here is used in sarcasm.  I personally can’t stand to see someone feeling bad about themselves; I feel worse if I’m the one who created it.  But I’m not the same way here.  You catch me in my favorite forum and I’ll do my best to hand you your ass!  Good news is nobody cares about what you look like in here.  You might be the pride of your high school/college/hole in wall, but don’t dare ever mention that here.  Don’t post your picture for anybody but yourself because nobody ever looks good online.  Com’on, take a look at mine.  Would you be friends with that guy? I look like an ass! Still we all do it, posting that cool pic that we thought made us look fantastic.  And maybe it does look alright, but there are so many more people looking to lay into you for anything here, and they will let you know it.    Remember the old adage that you can’t please all of the people all of the time.  Well there’s another little adage I like to say: Some people won’t be pleased… during any time.  Look At Micheal Moore.  That’s right, I said it.  Anyway, so to wrap this little baby up, Don’t come here for respect.  Come here for freedom, but don’t come here for respect.

      I wake up most every morning with a new phrase in my mind.    I’m not sure where they come from or if they pertain to something I dreamt or expect to deal with.    Oddly enough, most often they do not.    I take the phrase and I evaluate it, bend and shape it until I feel it is something that I am satisfied with.    Not that there are any rules here or anything.    I’m usually so tired in the morning that I’m surprised I even get this far.       So this morning while I was in the shower I thought of the phrase “Today is one of those days that you just feel you need to cry.” I didn’t feel like crying; I didn’t see it as a bad day, and I didn’t cry.    Why then did I even have this phrase stuck in my head?    I didn’t hear it anywhere.     It wasn’t the phrase itself this morning that was noteworthy, but rather the frequency it shows.    The fact that this does happen so often; phrases that simply cannot be applied; that would never have a place unless it was in an extreme situation, surrounded with great emotion and drama.     I’m not sure, but I’m pretty sure I have a point, and here it is.    There is a song lyric that goes, “the dreams in which I’m dying are the best I’ve ever had.” That’s oddly true for me.    I’m not suicidal, I don’t look around for my own death, but I’m in love wit my own death scene.    I love to feel the emotion that surrounds it.    The profound self of loss that you feel; the feeling that is the exact opposite of great joy.     But I’m not in a world where I have those kinds of emotions.    I instead live in a place where I hear moderate tones and moderate feelings; nothing more or less off to either side.    And I am a mediocrity who yearns for the strength of triumph and agony of defeat that I hold in some alternate universe.         These things that I hear every morning, they are my thoughts.    Perhaps they are coming from that other place.

                       I think we’re past the initial phase now; crossed over.    That rush of material that was just bursting from our organs to say, well it’s gone now.    Only this remains.    I look back over several entries from the start.    They dealt with a few topics form our daily lives; women, cars and computers.    Yeah, pretty much you could have summed it up into those three things and you would have the three of us pegged.    The entries for everyday would be a reentry into that thought, and addition, deeper channel.                    And what am I left with now: the same thing that this kind of telling always leaves me with; a profound emptiness.    I feel empty because what I really wanted was for my words to fall short of the pain and agony that I felt inside.    Still I wanted them to be the most grand of all failed words.                       I will say this instead, the words didn’t tell the tale; it was the repetition of the words that really spoke.    Looking back the resounding answer to the question is “Why are you not already through this phase of your life?    Why are you still asking the question?” And the words, well they are just as I expected, and less than I hoped.                   I think it has been mentioned before, but Roguen has exiled himself until this next year.    He’s working on something of his own; seems very excited about it.    People who know him wouldn’t think this all too odd, being excited and all about his work but take my word for it, this time it is.    He’s excited and depressed, and one hand seems to be washing the other.    He’s scheduled “reanimation” for this next year.    In his token phrase he claimed that he cannot fail.                   We are all tired here, with good reason as well, but the hunger will not stop.    I’ve been asked on several occasions now this week if I sleep at all.    Yes, I do sleep, and I sleep my fair share.    It is also true however that the more work that I have, the more productive I am with it.    I found this out during a few months of unemployment.    I could hardly raise myself from the couch, now you won’t find me sitting still.                   There is a piece of my mind that hoped I will crack under the pressure; hopes that I will reach the limit and break into two.    Wouldn’t that be phenomenal? But the truth is that there is always much more to us than we expect.    And that ladies and gentlemen… brings me back to the first point in this little entry, really the only point.    There is more, there is much more, and while words may describe it, time always ring true.
