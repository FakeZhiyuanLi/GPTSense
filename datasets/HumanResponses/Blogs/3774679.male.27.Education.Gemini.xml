      Have now been at home for nearly a week, and I am still operating in a kind of stupefied state. I think I might be having trouble adapting to English humidity. However a purely psychological explanation would also be in order. The weight of the past crushes me whenever I return home, all the little forgotten things, habits most of all. All my attempts to invent myself as a new person abroad get folded back onto the old me as a meagre layer of sediment.  Saw my old friend M. His impulsive dismissive nature was not very helpful. He went someway to reminding me just how fragile my sense of self is, how the smallest comment can shatter my self-esteem.   Everything feels tainted, exhausted, unbearable. I am restless, incapable of focus/clarity and relate to the future only with apprehension. Am I getting depressed?

      Now I’ve got a bit more time on my hands I should try and write a little more (did you see that? “try and write” rather than “try to write”: I talk like this so why not write like this? – how language evolves!) Anyway I just travelled across Russia from Ulaanbaatar to Moscow by train, which was a far less unpleasant experience than one might have thought. I got a great send off from my Mongolian colleagues and the rather dubious leaving present of a CD of Mongolian orchestral music (the most nauseatingly sentimental kitsch imaginable). It was far too hot and I had far too much luggage. Northern Mongolia was much as I expected, the usual rocky rolling landscape. Passed through Darkhan, which actually looked a pretty pleasant place in a socialist city on the steppe kind of way. Near the border I finally saw some fields for the first time since I left the UK. At the border everything becomes much more lush, indeed crossing the border at night, the sky was black with flashes of distant lightening and it soon started raining. Hence the impression, Mongolia: Dry, rocky; Russia: wet, lush. It made one wonder about the historical reasons for the border being where it is. Clearly the Russians took the good bit and left the arid rough grazing to the south as Mongolia. Travelling along the shore of lake Baikal was for me the highlight of the whole train journey. The landscape of mountains, lush valleys and shear grandeur of the lake was quite stunning and even more so than before lake Baikal is a place I would really like to visit in a proper and prolonged fashion. After charming Irkutsk, Siberia starts to get a bit samey, endless even. Once in Russian the landscape changes very little all the way to the Baltic. Nevertheless after a year in harsh Mongolia the meadows, forests and cottages of Siberia were refreshing and quite beautiful.   I would have liked to take lots of photographs from the train. However it seems to be a feature of Russian trains that the windows cannot be opened, or at least only with a special key kept by the guard, so there wasn’t really any occasion for photography.   On the train I had to live on noodles. The sense of the passage of time became rather skewed, days and nights drifted into each other. But oddly the movement of the train helped insure that I never really became bored. I was rereading Woolf’s ‘The Waves’ a book of stunning introspective beauty. It seemed fitting given time alone and the flux of landscape around me.  It was very interesting to see the Ural Mountains. Most people have heard of the Urals but doubt most of them could form an image of them. Indeed they are hardly mountains at all, more reminiscent of the Black Forest than the Alps. They are low, forested and only in a few places were there rock outcrops.   The landscape of European Russia particularly the approaches to Moscow reminded me of Stalinist propaganda posters; utopian visions of socialist skyscraper cities rising out of the great Russian plain. Such a vision is partially realised in Moscow itself especially in its metro and the spires scattered on the skyline by Stalin. I wonder what could have been had Hitler never invaded the Soviet Union had developed unhindered on Stalin’s course. I once saw some clips from the late 30’s film ‘New Moscow’ and am also acquainted with a Geographical Magazine article of the time outlining Soviet plans for the development of Moscow into a modern city. I fully recognise the nightmare reality of the Soviet era but I am far from immune to the romance of Soviet Communism, the iconography, the utopian vision. It’s quite compelling for me and I have to wonder if I had lived at the time would I have been caught up in ‘Communism’? Would I have been able to see through it as we all can now?   The Moscow metro was as wonderful as I remember. Though I can recognise it as kitsch I actually quite like Socialist Realist art. For me it is a continuation and renewal of the tradition of European religious art. One complaint about the metro is that it lacks clear station signs that can be seen from the train. They are their to be fair but they are normally bronze and don’t stand out from a distance.  In most respects Moscow seemed like just another large European city.  On the plane home I was reintroduced to the world of English stereotypes. I sat next to two girls whose irritating accents and trivial talk of office social events and Big Brother housemates represents everything in life I feel compelled to refuse.

      Totally stressed out about my packing. The temperature is in the 30's which is far too hot to do anything as far as I am concerned. I find myself in a sort of limbo. I don't really have anything to do but pack and clean but am caught in a circuit of procrastination. Having finished my job and shut down my social life here I'm walking around in a sort of aimless daze. Nothing seems very real at this point. Really hoping it cools down soon because I'm going to have to wear a lot of clothing, at least onto the plane. The shit will hit the fan shortly.

      Relatively interesting day. Went to the 'Intellectual' museum here in Ulaanbaatar. Turns out it doesn't quite match the description. It is in fact a puzzle and toy museum with various stuff from around the world mixed with the puzzles and drawings made by the owner, who is very keen to show off his brilliance. He must be hell to live with.  Well frankly I hate puzzles. I don't have the right kind of brain for them and they normally just frustrate and/or bemuse me. It's all too Belgian!!! Being a philosopher at heart I prefer problems and solutions to be posited simultaneously in a philosophical decision. All this deductive stuff is for logicians. Nevertheless it was a rather interesting cultural experience and his daughter(?) who did the translating was quite attractive (which helped!). Ended up buying something to be polite.  On the way back Rg pointed out the old Mongolian parliament building, which is not much bigger than a typical English village hall.

      Just spent most of the morning creeping round my flat with a fly swat, really gotta take the rubbish out more regularly in future.   Got a message from JW, seems she has met someone at the summer school she is working at that she wants to set me up with for a date. Naturally the very idea of a 'date' in any form fills me with dread. I can't really envisage anything other than a disastrous outcome. I don't know what JW is thinking, her image of me is perhaps a little clouded and she is projecting qualities onto me for the sake of her little scheme. 2 plus 2 does not equal 5 however, and I don't know what the poor woman in question would end up thinking of JW for having set her up with quite such a freak as me. All this rather messes with my head since this year I have really sort of come out as a confirmed celibate, at least in my Mongolian social context. If the girl really is nice couldn't I just meet her socially rather than go through the ghastly ritualistic practice of dating which I have no experience of and am totally intimidated by? Since I consider romantic relationships impossible for me I'd be far happier just aiming for friendship, its a much safer place to start.  Anyway I can't afford to wine and dine on my third world salary.  Consulted EJSW in Argentina on this. She says I should 'bite the bullet'. I guess I should have expected that. Also says I'm not such an odd bloke really. I can't agree I fear. She doesn't know my interior monologues. As ever EJSW is all surface and froth, I don't think she really understands me at all. But in case she ever reads this let me add the proviso that I place the highest value on even the most trite counsel from her.

      Was just listening to Cities by Talking Heads. Prompts these meditations.  Cities I have lived in: Croydon;Home till age 5. Actually feel quite warm toward this deathly dull dump, perhaps because my family got out and I never had to suffer the worst of it. How I miss the Whitgift centre as it used to be without that overly refined roof. Both homely and supremely naf. Caterham; A town of very little consequence. Neither beautiful nor ugly. I don't feel any real loyalty to where I grew up. Why? Perhaps because I always felt rather alienated from that middle class culture that washed around me. Perhaps because Caterham is so meshed in the south London suburb web that it can't really form a focal point in its own right. Coventry; now this really is a dump. I only ever went to the centre for shopping, mainly by bike. I was not impressed. Do have some fond memories of the cycle route in however. I thrive on modest doses of solitude in green spaces. Doesn't everybody? Leamington Spa; Hard to fathom that I lived here for three years. Never really gave the place much thought actually. Far more charm than Coventry, beautiful gardens along the river stand out, but in most respects not that remarkable. Bydgoszcz, Poland; Far more interesting. Location of Mozg, my favorite bar. Memories of friendship, falling snow. Once jogged around the town in the rain on magic mushrooms, curse those devilish Wyndhams! Great park spaces and architecture that is often enough charming in that central European way, but with enough disrepair to stop it feeling showy. Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; A planned socialist dream city. Too open, too shallow rooted in its urban culture, but not without its own charm especially in summer when it comes to life a bit. The traffic and winter coalsmoke are quite hellish. The building site quality of the place is as alarming as it is charming. Welding next to children playing basketball. Showers of sparks on the street below. And lets not forget those dickensian street urchins that lurk on every corner. Tbilisi, Georgia; Not there yet but really looking forward to a new and richer urban environment. Can I cope with the guns and the drinking culture? Not to mention the primitive gender politics.

      And more to point I just bought a rail ticket to Moscow; to find an exit from my current situation: Mongolia.  The day after tomorrow I at least should be heading for the Gobi desert, a place many people would consider fairly synonymous with hell. So it should suit me then. I just got started. When I get back in a week or 2 I may actually find something more intelligent to say.  Key points for now: I'm in Mongolia, and doubtless will discourse on the experience at length in due course.  I'll soon be heading home by train and plane to encounter old friends in and around London.  Come September I'll be heading for Tbilisi, Georgia, which should at the very least give me something to write about if it doesn't get me killed. Why this nomadic lifestyle? Well for me personally right now I simply see no alternative. I'll probably go into that at length later as well.

      Current stack of books at my bedside: 	Neuropolitics: Thinking, Culture, Speed (Theory Out of Bounds) ~William E. Connolly. This book is good, but the style is very American and the thesis a bit wishy-washy. The Puppet and the Dwarf, Organs without Bodies. Both classic Zizek, though the latter slides around its themes a lot. Keith Ansell Pearson’s review was right about him quoting secondary texts too much. The New Schelling. Just got this, looks good for a book of academic essays. Schelling is a fashionably unfashionable philosopher for me. I always follow the minor current, trouble is it keeps taking over the mainstream. Stories I Stole: A Journey to Georgia. Wendell Steavenson. Preliminary reading for my next teaching destination. Kind of unnerving. It certainly is a crazy place. I’ve really to build up my resistance to alcohol before I get there. Incidentally. Wendell Steavenson to judge by her picture is a stunningly attractive lass with something of the Susan Sontag about her. www.citypages.com/.../ 24_1167/24_1167a11188.jpg
