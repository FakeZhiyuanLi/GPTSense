      Indeed they are.  My lovely friends S&M have vacated the isle of inscruitable people and indeleble concrete for greater peace and glory in the UK. Well, more drugs and Marmite anyway.  Their departure rattles me enough to start recording my thoughts in the form of this uLtRa-kEwL blog.  Strange stuff. So now I sit in the school staff office of a small middle school on the north coast of the kansai area in Japan.  I will move on in about four weeks and I am completely unprepared for this event.  My psudo-religious philosophy of "It will all work out in the end" has resulted in my not planning the next stage of my life any further than "get the hell out of this rice field" and thus I am beginning to feel the first smidgings of doubt.  Need a job, need a job, need a job. The situation is compounded and complicated by the unplanned birth of a love affair - now about 4 months old.  I still can`t believe that Y "likes" me (Nb. if a Japanese girl says she likes you, check your fingers for any rings she may have secreted on without your noticing) although I almost believe she does now...  If it wasn`t for her or the Baka Futari, who along with this Athapist make up the magneficent TEAM SD I would be straining at the leash to leave this place.  Why?  1.The job is shit and pointless leading to a huge drop in my self esteem. 2.This town is simply too dead. 3.I have ridden my bike over every road for about 20kms in every direction; nothing more to see. 4.I have become an introvert due to lack of socialisation.  I actually LIKE being left alone now and this is not healthy in a soon the be 25 year old.  I will, however, miss:  1. The sea. 2. Some of the little fuckers I "teach" English to. 3. The familiarity that is easily mistaken for fondness that one builds with an area after one has lived there for some time. 4. Some other friends not mentioned. 5. Seriously, that`s it.

      Melting, I MMMMMEEEEELLLTTTIIINNNGG (said in a wicked witch of the west stylee).  Ye-furkin-nonexistant-gods, its hot!  And Humid.  Topped 33degrees yesterday.  A mild 32 today, but it`s cloudy for fucks sake!  Never mind, it seems to give these lovely colleagues of mine a confirmation of their socio-psyche, i.e. the Japanese spirit.  In the room within which I am currently sweating there are two air conditioners - neither of which are being used.  Thus my colleagues stumble around drenched in sweat complaining about the heat to each  other.  This is OK however as suffering maketh the Japanese soul...  My weekend was variable.  Friday was a meal in my local and decidedly average izakaya with Y and two of her friends Kazuya and, er, someone whose name I can`t recall.  This was the first time I had been out with Y and her friends, every other time we had gone out with other people it was with my peeps.  We got pissed and the evening went quite well except for one thing; there was a change in our relationship.  She now had the power whereas it had always been me.  Also, I was on display and had the duty to not embarrass her.  This made me very uncomfortable and I tried to discuss it with her when we got home but only succeeded in making her cry.  Minus 1000 points me.  The next day was a beach party on the "bridge to heaven" for all the gaijin in Kyoto-fu.  Lovely weather, lovely beer, but I can confirm again that I don`t like large groups of foreigners in Japan.  There is something a little too desperate about them.  I left early to go home and make up with Y.... Nice.  On Sunday Y and I went for a drive around the peninsula, as she doesn't like swimming.  We chatted and eventually went back to my place for sex.  Given it was the first sex in weeks that was not drunken, it was great.  Afterwards we went to a great izakaya for dinner but Y was too spaced from the sex to talk.  Now it is Monday and I have started my final lessons with students.  They seem quite indifferent about my leaving which is a relief.
