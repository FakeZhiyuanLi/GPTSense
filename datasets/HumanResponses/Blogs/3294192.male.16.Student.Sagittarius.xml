      because the ground is lava.  I walked home from Rublin's house today, which was about three times as far as I thought it would be. I ended up getting lost in a dead end and found a playground called Wm. Orchard Playground, in Maplewood. I remembered it distinctly from back in fourth grade. Me and Erika Tomzak went there one day to hang out. I also passed by both Jefferson and SOMS, bringing back lots of memories. I can't wait to look back on highschool with enhanced retro-specto-vision. Maybe then I'll be able to see the obviously wisest path of actions, and how I took a path almost perfectly perpendicular to it. My walk also inspired me to consider buying new shoes. These converse are starting to give me severe foot-aches, so I guess the "flat foot of doom" myth was true after all. I can't imagine wearing anything else though; growing up everybody in cartoons wore converse, and to me, everything else just looks too stylized. Except Pumas, they're nice and simple, I know how to work the simple shoe. Anybody want to lend me  urlLink $80 ? I got home after about fifty minutes of walking, which was roughly three miles distance. I was almost late for Kirsten's surprise party, but no. Stephen kindly drove me over and I was in. Besides a lackluster "Surprise." the little get-together was nice. I got to know some of the kids on the fencing team a bit better, and got to grill some meat. It's exactly as simple as I thought it was.   Tomorrow morning me and Zack will be shipping out to Pennsylvania to visit the Pops, and I get to DJ the ride there. I really want to show him Belle & Sebastian, Television, Squarepusher, Sleater-Kinney, The Smiths, The Unicorns, Mission of Burma, Yo La Tengo, The Moving Units, and mostly Breaker! Breaker!. Hopefully he'll enjoy it and I can claim some responsibility for his growth into an educated and stylish man.   Someone needs to smash the high-school prom tradition with a Divine Hammer. Instead of my senior prom, I intend to go on a drive, a really long drive, North, and I'll call the awesomely expansive and beautiful territory I find, "Maine". " urlLink I'm trying to organize a prison break. " My car will be able to seat  four other people . The revolution will not have a door-price.

      That quote "such great heights" and the following doodle of a drumset obviously  meant  that those lyrics worked to the rhythm of "Such Great Heights" by the Postal Service. It's true. Try to sing along!   "He finds it's hard to speak,   "I, am thinking it's a sign,   in his own room for weeks,   that the freckles in our eyes,   his bed's the eastern front,   are mirror images,   when fighting off disease.   and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned."   Sit straight up, don't stare."   That last line still makes no rhythm though. God, I wish I could make beats as hot as the Postal Service's. I wonder how they do it, probably with some awesome old-school piece of hardware I'll never see. Where's the beatmachine for the common man? I need my beatz!  Actually, me (and  urlLink Guy ) like to use the  urlLink Hammerhead Beat Machine , and I've started looking at  urlLink Drumbox 1.0 . It's great because it allows you to easily make samples from  any  .WAV file. I can't wait to make a drum track that says "Snare snare snare snare bass BASS bass sna- bass tom tom ta-tom tom cyabaaaaallll." I've also heard good things about  urlLink Fruityloops , but I'm to cheap to pay and too lazy to kazaa. Take  THAT  Fruityloops! So I'll keep on working with these two   FREE   beaters. If anybody knows of any other share-ware/free-ware beat machine emulators, let me know. I'm all about that.

      I was hanging out with Kirsten for pretty much all of Nancy's party, but I denied her many invitations to dance, because it's just not my thing. Even though I tried to learn how to do the "one two three" with Emily Brisbon. Then Kirsten told Jason Kohn how I had done everything a date is supposed to except dance with her, and he called me a slacker. That was the best part of the evening. I then later proved to be a hypocrite and danced my ass somewhat looser to the tune of "I Believe In A Thing Called Love" with Joanna. In retrospect, I could've danced a lot cooler. After Nancy's ball I got home around 12:30-1:00-ish (?) and decide to see if I could load Windows XP Professional on to my shit old laptop. I was half awake through the process, which ended around 3 due to incredibly slow load times, and my laptop's inability to restart without forceful intervention.   I woke up Saturday morning and realized how easy it is to ruin a laptop when you're half asleep and at the same time 'toe-up' on socializing. So I spent the morning deleting, reinstalling, registry editing, and eventually giving up. Maybe I'll check back later to see if this little black slab has healed itself, but more likely, I'll check back later and smash it to bits with my bloody torn-up fists. I then found there was nothing worth doing outside of my own room, and watched ancient movies on TCM for about 5 hours, until Stephen got back from grocery shopping, I then did the exact same thing for about 2 more hours, after consuming three or four cans of Coke. TCM is quickly becoming one of my favorites channels, next to TechTV, and right now, is one of the few channels I know the number for on our damned new satellite service. I swear, it is the least efficient form of service I've ever seen.  Today, I woke up around 11 and drank some more Coke, then started tweaking my desktop PC a bit more. Making this machine about as efficient and friendly as a really efficient subjective weapon can be. 6 hours and 2 more Cokes later  urlLink Guy  stopped by and we worked on the  urlLink new hartzmakee song  a bit, adding some guitar and a tweaked keyboard. If you listen real close at around the 48 second mark, you can hear my favorite part. The guitar and bass intersect so perfectly. Otherwise, it's really slow and nice and meditative. I'm going to try to re-do the guitar track to have much more intersections, and some hotter timing. By hotter I happen to mean accurate. Hopefully I can finish this up in mixing, because I'm loosing interest in writing material for it. Sometimes I feel as though I have no patience for the process of creating music, but more for the working of it, i.e. directing a movie rather than acting in it. Half-way through recording, I walked my dog and came up with some lines which I wrote down in my little marble ass-note-book.   "He finds it's hard to speak, in his own room for weeks, his bed's the eastern front, when fighting off disease. Sit straight up, don't stare."   I can only assume this is me thinking about being bed-ridden by a cold, and thinking about double-you double-you two after downloading  urlLink Red Orchestra . I also wrote "such great heights" followed by a doodle of a drumset. Now I understand the value of jotting down ideas; in return I get vague or indecipherable garbage! Score! Those lines are neat though. Maybe I'll use them for something.  Tomorrow starts another school week, the fourth to last of the school year. Hopefully I've done better this quarter, but It's really hard to say. I'm not feeling too optimistic though,  because I'm really good at sneaking in and sabotaging my own education. Good grades are reserved for smart and pretty girls.

      So I'm in love with the short haired vixen from the ' urlLink Layers of color ' Gap commercial. The one with all the tank tops, and those eyes....va va voom. The way she smirks, the way she opens her eyes as if it's the first time she's seen you, every time... I'm in love.  I'm also in love with  urlLink Adam West . He's in some damn commercial advertising 'EZ Link" terminals, which are like little internet kiosks that buisness owners can buy and use to make more money. He starts to describe all the features, like e-mail, web browsing, instant messaging, and then gets really serious and says, "I never had half those gadgets in  my  batcave." He says it with such contempt, as if buying an "EZ Pass" kiosk is a personal insult to him. Well I'm sorry Mr. West, but I DEMAND that my clients have access to an affordable internet kiosk! I DEMAND.  I've got a hot idea for a visual heartsmacker. It'll be animated, using models and the school's animation equipment. It'll star a red toy tank with glued on lobster claws, and will feature Cupid, who's arrows can NOT penetrate the armor. I repeat, they can not penetrate. I sure hope I have time to start this before the year ends, I've also got to finish my other animation about sharks. The tank will also be yelling "Sorry Ladytron! Sorry Ladytron!"  At this very moment I'm watching the 1953 classic 'The War of the Worlds. It really makes me want to be a filmmaker. The best part so far has been the general of the military fighting the alien warships, calls all his troops "..Communist babies..." for abandoning their posts. Then he and a priest are incinerated by the Martian heat rays. What a great movie. And of course, the awesome scientist who eventually saves the day, decides to hang around with the dumbest bitch he can find. I hate her. Where have all the smart ladies gone?   Scientist: If the A-Bomb fails, my calculations show that they will conquer the entire earth in six days. Stupid Bitch: The same time it took to create it, how ironic.  You see what I mean? I'm so glad the bomb fails. It's sort of neat, to see how much this movie inspired later sci-fi flicks, and is still present today. Even Signs borrowed so much from it. Speaking of that, M. Night Shyamalan's next movie, 'The Village', (The story of the village of Covington, Pennsylvania in 1897 and the horrifying legend of "mythical creatures" that live in the woods beyond the village.) looks great. I haven't seen any trailers except the one telling me that he directed it. He has such a talent for terror I can't wait.  I won't be able to enjoy it without my tank-top girl though. "Attention please, four minutes to bomb time."

      Big news for 'hearts-audio-macky' lovers, new song in the works. You can see for yourself  urlLink HERE . It is tentatively titled "I need a purse", and sounds a lot like a song from 'Revenge of the Nerds', except you know, cooler. It's also really really basic as of now, only a drum track and keyboard. Expect more soon, such as "guitars" and "more guitars". Maybe we'll even implement some good old fashioned leg slapping, you know, to liven it up. Anyway, drop me a comment and let me know what you think. Hell, maybe you'll inadvertently destroy my will to create music. Go for it!  This song was made using one of my favorite applications, called  urlLink Audacity . They released V 1.2.1 about 2 weeks ago, and it has so many new improvements. I really recomend you check it out if you're at all interested in home recording. The program itself is completely free, and very intuitive. It'll also make you look like a professional when your screen looks like this.    urlLink     In other news, I "picked up" a full copy of ' urlLink OK Computer ' today, from a "friend", named "Alex Yablon". It's pretty much what I expected from those weirdos in Radiohead, and doesn't stray far from the solid rockingness of 'Paranoid Android'. Not to say that it rocks like a rock and roll musical piece, but it rocks me. I also started tuning into  urlLink Belle and Sebastian  on my walk home today while job hunting. It made it a lot more fun when the song 'Step Into My Office, Baby' came on. Good stuff.

      Feed me your music. I am like a CD whore, so just bring in your favorite music some day and I'll take it home for listening. If it's actually any good, I'll rip that shit. If not, you've still done me a favor. I promise a 24-hour turn around time!  Music is really good at surprising me. Whenever I think I've heard every dimension that music can be in, and everything in between, I'm able to find something new I could never have imagined. Just go to a record shop and put on the big ugly headphones that they've got hanging around. Now listen to an album you've never heard of. I bet a million dollars you'd never come up with that shit. Stuff like that convinces me the world exists outside my head.  It also convinces me that there must be so much music out there that hasn't and won't be made, ever. I bet a lot of it is really good too. Most musical explorers, or 'musicians', try to find this stuff by saying to themselves "I'm going to write a new song! I'll play music until it sounds good and is not obviously a copyright violation!". I do that too, but what I actually wish I could do is dive into that murky sea of ghost music. I bet ghost music isn't so scary.  Journals about music, and an authors love of music, get really lame, because there is no easy and legal way of sharing tunes over the virtranet for all to hear. Maybe someday you'll understand what I mean when I say "I felt like the keyboard solo in 'The Imposter' by  urlLink Elvis Costello ." Or maybe you do already, and if you're one of those lucky people, drop me a comment. I'll feel less like and indie-elitist and more like a friend.  'Cuz I'm hard like that!

      ***** If I had a tinfoil suit, I'd snatch up the sun for you.  I did some hot work on the old  urlLink heartzmackie  last night, it's going to be quite a new site once I get finished with it. The only problem though, is the tiny amount of bandwidth I get from geocities. It might not even be running right now, so don't fret if it is down. If you've actually seen it, then you'll recognize those crazy brain 'anatomy' diagrams I'm so fond of. Phrenology is really interesting stuff, it's all wrong, but it was so instrumental in getting to where we are now in understanding that squishy grey smart part of ourselves.  ***** If I had a pair of special boots, then I'd heist the moon too.  I saw ' urlLink Troy ' this weekend with my pops. I would recommend it, except I wouldn't see it again myself. I'm not saying that you have no taste, I'm simply saying I have more. The story is  very  weakly based on what we've been able to figure out about the battle of Troy. Too much romantics shit, too little character development, and no where near enough naked Brad Pitt, half the movie was him wearing nothing, and I demand he wears less. Skin him.  ***** And if I had an amazing net, with a handle a million miles long,  So I'm learning to play the song "In These Woods" by  urlLink Les Savy Fav . It's a challenge though, trying to figure out the synthed keyboard parts of the song. I think It'll be great once KP can play it though. Check this shit out. "I'm afraid we're Hansel-ed, I'm afraid we're Cancel and Grettel-ed, I'm afraid we don't have the mettel, to make it in these woods." Those are really nice words.  ***** I'd reach out my windows and really stretch, and bring the stars to harm.  "I can't stop to mess around, I got a brand new rose in town, ah!"

      And they've been here all along.  Tonight feels really wasted. Luckily, this weekend will be action packed. I'm going to my dad's place, which means more skinned knees, if you catch my drift. If you crash my curb. I also have one metric  ass-load  of homework to do, so I'm going to have to put off my urge to stay up late gaming with the pops.  I'm a fucking cutie apparently.  My heart's been getting it's daily smack requirements recently, and that's a good thing. I worked with that Guy on some hot beatz today for a little while, and we produced something smooth and satisfying. Hopefully I can sqeeze some more work on it into my weekend agenda.  Filler filler filler filler filler filler filler!  Looky what I did!   urlLink     Fucking God. There is a new video game coming out soon. It's called  urlLink Onimusha 3 . In it, you control a feudal Japanese ninja/samurai named Samonosuke, and also 1950's French hitman named  urlLink Leon , as played by Jean Reno in the amazing French film 'The Proffesional'. If that wasn't enough, there is also a 40 inch long ceremonial samurai sword you can use as a controller for your PS2. Fucking God. Ninjas are awesome, 'The Professional' is awesome, and me running around my house swinging a toy sword screaming "I AM SAMONOSUKE!" is the awesomest. Watch out ming vase, watch out cat, here comes Jono. Fucking God.   Konichiwah Bitchess.

      I've pirated myself some great music this very evening. Why, it's so good, that if the RIAA troopers kicked down my door, beat the shit out of me, and locked me away in Atomic Fusion State Penitentiary, in the center of The Sun, it would still have been worth it. Well, maybe the new Modest Mouse album isn't  that  good, but it's close. It's a lot smoother than their previous stuff, and I really dig that. It's like it has been polished with a soft rag while secretly drugged and "reconditioned". I'm also about to burn some CDs for Molly, namely the four Pixies albums I own, and a copy of "Good news for people who love bad news". It's great to know that I can deliver so much entertainment at no cost to myself. It's as if CD-Rs grow on trees in my house. Magical trees in my green-house.   Also.  Already made the plan. When I turn 17, I'm going to get my restricted license. I'm then going to install a mount for my iPod on my dashboard. Allowing me the massive pleasure of driving around listening to great music. Step three consists of asking Molly if she'd like a ride. Then I (or we) drive head first away from South Orange. We'll live off the land and music, making our way westward. Eventually I reckon we'd have to rob a hip record store to refill. Step five, push my car off the coast and watch it accordian on the rocks below. Step six is the most important, because it's a mystery.  Even though I said I would work on some Heartsmackingz, it never happened, and probably won't for a while. As the end of school and our summer show draw nearer every day band practice and homework seem to be sucking my free-time dry. If you looked inside my chest you would find a small dried raisin titled "joy and lollygagging". At least the KP  practicing is paying off. We perfected a hot and mysterious song today, and it was really a blast to perform. I just hope we can learn the rest of our designated covers come  urlLink June 12th . This show seems extra important to me, simply because of the inherent visibility. It makes me so proud that people living next to or even near to Flood's Hill have no choice but to be rocked.  "A robot with a car can get from here to Canada in eight hours.  urlLink Rogue Retrieval  was faster than that, and they recovered my car too."

      I am incredibly tired, and I think I should go to bed around 9 or 10 tonight. I remember when I was little that 9 was bedtime, and me and my brother would push it to 10, and eventually 11, and now I normally don't get to sleep until about 2. That's why I'm sleepy I guess. Part of the reason I want to get a little more sleep than normal tonight is tomorrow's agenda. I'm going to Six Flags with most of my physics class. To sign up, I had to deal with a couple of forms that were quite a hassle to get properly signed and returned on time. A lot of people I know aren't going tomorrow because they weren't able to do this. It's funny, because when you ask them about it, they say it doesn't matter, because they hate Six Flags anyway. Or maybe  urlLink Guy  is the only person who says that, oh well. But c'mon, how can you hate Six Flags? I can understand not enjoying roller-coasters, but less than you want to sit in a school on a beautiful spring day? Incredible. I plan to spend the day with my buddy  urlLink Kate , who was also able to return her permission slips on time. It'll be good fun.   In my quest for more and comics, I took another one out of the school library. It's called "Berlin: City of Stone" and is a historical fiction about the life of an artist in Berlin, Germany, right before the rise of the Nazis. So far, it's really good, but it's a whopping 250 or so pages long, so I'm not done yet. It's also only number 1 in a set of 3. Oh and you will not believe what I discovered inside it! Breasts and penises and fucks, oh my. I guess it's a them I can learn to deal with, and maybe even love. One comic I really like that has yet to show me the standard B&P&Fs is " urlLink Scary Go Round " by John Allsion. It's what I playfully call a "web comic". The archives go back for what seems like years, and he even links to his previous comic which has even MORE entries. I believe that the characters in the comic are based on his real-life friends, and this inspires me. Because I've got friends, and I like comics, so why the hell shouldn't I draw my own damn comic? Because I know it'd be about me, and I can't draw my new haircut. Fucking buzzcut. A journal comic of my own life might be nice though, however, it would replace these text posts in an instant. I really like the works of  urlLink Drew Weing  and his journal comic, " urlLink The Journal Comic ". His new project called "Little Trees" looks really good, but there are only about 3 pages so far. Correction, exactly 3 pages. He also has a comic called " urlLink Pup " on  urlLink Serializer , which I've only been able to get a glimpse of due to the nature of Serializer requiring a subscription. It does give you a lot of content though, so maybe I'll consider it. Hell, I could be their freaking spokesman the way I get infatuated with comics. So let's move on.  I'm listening to "In These Woods" by Les Savy Fav. I think it would be really cool if  urlLink we  did a cover of this song at our summer show. It has a bunch of interesting yet simple keyboard parts that me and Jon could play with. It also rocks like a trailer in Vegas.  zing . Another song of theirs I like is "Hide Me From Next February". It gets a bit repetitive at the end, but the introductory vocals kick my ass like an ass-kicking machine.  zing ? No? Okay. In other KP news, me and Jon recorded some more guitar-tracks today in his basement. They sounded hot, and I was able to put out the really nice strumming for 'Rome'. I sure hope these songs get mixed down nicely, this new album could be our best. Jon came up with the title "Volume? Clarity? Bass?", which is from "Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas". At first I thought it was bad, and assumed it was just Jon being romanticized by the book, but the context it is in in the story actually makes it really nice, and I wouldn't mind using it all now that I know what the context is.  Denial is the root of forgetfulness. And forgetting is the root of upsetting. I need to make more  urlLink heartsmackingz .  Off I go to -----> The University of You Suck.              (Care of  urlLink Cat&Girl  and  urlLink Scary Go Round )

      IT SHALL BE DONE!  The other day Ryan mentioned some post I made on the  wonderful   urlLink Dumbrella  messageboards, regarding the band Breaker! Breaker!. This name was farmiliar to me, but I had no music by them on my hungry hungry hard-drive. So Ryan kindly pointed me to  urlLink their site , where I downloaded eleven, yes that's right, eleven free songs from their three albums. Great stuff. I suggest you go check it out immediately. They also have some awesome videos for you to watch and giggle with. They have a wonderful subdued energy that works so well with this current wave of awesome weather. I suggest you try the combo before time runs out and it snows again.  Ever since I took part in the  urlLink 24 hour comic challenge  down at Commuter Comics, I've been revamping my passion for the graphic novel. Yeah, that's what I call them now, because comics are for cocksuckers and little punks. Most recently I read "Paul Has a Summer Job" by Michel Habagliati. I found it in the school library and at first was doubtful, due to the dull idea of having a job. I was wrong though, this story is really well shaped, and really touching. It also has a lot of breasts and penises and fucks. Those seem to be recurring themes in ANY grpahic novel ever written. Earlier today I also bought a copy of "Canvas" by Alex Fellows. It's about a young girl and her friends as they discover, well, breasts and penises and fucks, go figure. I did enjoy it though, and am so proud to see my top bookshelf filling up with "damn cartoons". More than a couple days ago i bought "Heaven LLC" by Wayne Chinsang and Dave Crosland. My intention was purely to brighten my mood after getting a GAME OVER at a job interview moments before. What ensued was quite a trip, brought to you by, breasts and penises and the head of John the Baptists and fucks.   So I spent this Mother's Day at my dad's house, doing things my mom would never aprove of. Luckily, "we're not clebrating Mother's Day this weekend", so I have one more week to buy her a gift. Hopefully  urlLink Zack  can take me to like a Crate & Barrel or a Bed Bath & Beyond this week after school. I really want to get her something nice, but it's hard to save up money with all these failed job interviews and comics just  begging  to be purchased.   Coming up next, my thoughts on working hard for good/mediocre grades,  urlLink Zack  being a brother  and  a friend, breasts and penises and fucks, and so much more.  I keep hearing thunder outside, I hope it's thunder, and not a giant robot dragging is gargantuan legs accross my town. Pray for Mojo  and  Jono tonight.

      Let's see where this leads.  I've found a lot of really good music lately, and the majority of it has coincidentally the same sound. It has all melted together in my mind. It has lead to some very good playlists though.   Recently, Breaker! Breaker! The Epoxies Erase Errata The Do Nothing Machine The Breeders Les Savy Fav Pavement The Moving Units The Postal Service  The woman in  urlLink Breaker! Breaker!  has the nicest voice. It makes her sound so cunning and intelligent. If only all girls could get so deep under my skin just by talking. They are the few treasures. I guess it's the price she pays for  urlLink looking so cool .  Those thoughts lead me to write a song, about robots. Hopefully, it can be the lyrics to Summons.  "I'm a machine. I run from rust. Robots get hot from friction not from love. Now summer shows up, humidity. I know it's bad, electricity. Robots get hot from friction not from love. Now summer shows up, and it's barren of, Robots that run and robots that jump, and you."  I guess it's about stigma. The robot knows that humidity can fuck up his circuits, so he's going to stay inside and alone over the summer. He feels that occurences in his life only revolve around maintaining himself. So he worries about friction and discards oppritunites for love, while a girl stays home because there are no robots to run or jump with.   urlLink iTunes  has really given me good opportunities to get my rock&roll on. It makes the construction of playlists painless enough that I have started regularly using them in conjunction with my favorite iPod, which despite my previous grievances, has yet to show any severe signs of an aging battery. iTunes have a very smooth mesh with the Apple Music store, which I am starting to consider more and more reputable. Maybe I'll stop borrowing music. Maybe I'll put away my pirate flag and eyepatch. Maybe I'll even uninstall  urlLink WinMX . FUCK NO, what else is a cable modem good for?

       ...in the eyes of those who would strike us down. We are all the same in the eyes of those who would hold us back."  xoxo - urlLink New Khantra Album    I'm feeling much like a fuck-up, but I'm a 16 year old boy, so I guess it's not uncommon. The idea of summer is starting to depress me, as I think of all the crap I'll have to do to make up for mistakes I could've avoided. I have to take 6 classes to make up for an F in Health, all of which will most likely take time away from my film course. I have to pay $100+ dollars to fix my car which I managed to crash into myself. I need to pay to replace my brother's $400 bike which I left unlocked, and is now in someone else's possesion. I need to somehow also pay for $800 of car insurance. All this money, is coming from I don't know where. Would've come from a job had I put more effort into getting hired, but no, I guess I screwed that up too.  Tonight, I would've liked to be out with some friends, but my mother doesn't want me to leave my house after 10:40 because, she doesn't want me to. She can't explain it using any logical reasoning other than I need to clean my room. Makes no fucking sense.  Breakfast is always better with friends, and so are video games.  urlLink Kirsten  is the perverted type of girl who just likes to watch, so I played up to  World 3  in Super Mario Brothers 3 for her. It was fun. World FUCKING 3. That amazed me. We also listened to her nice music, and watched my favorite music video.    "Love it, or leave it, leaves no room to change it"  xoxo - urlLink New Khantra Album

      What a time I've had, living in my life for the past few days. Oh won't you let me surmise?  School is supposed to be over, as I took the last of my final exams on Friday in the horrible heat. Sadly, this is not exactly true for me. I managed to fail Health 10, so I must take 6 days of summer school. The worst part just may be standing in line to register. Hopefully, the 6 days I'm assigned won't intersect too horribly with my film course, although they most likely will. That's a real bummer, and I feel like an ass for getting myself into such a crappy position.  After my final final on Friday, I walked home with Matt and we played video games for many hours. It felt really good to get back in touch with him, since nobody else will play with me and my toys. I was able to vent a bit of my frustration with my Xbox though, by explaining to him how impossible it has turned out to be to modify it. Later in the afternoon I went over to Jon's where I met up with the usual suspects plus the members of At Any Cost, who would be playing a show with us later that evening.   What a show it was.   At Any Cost played an awesome set filled with their usual un-tethered enthusiasm and rowdiness.  urlLink We  followed right after them, playing one of our literally hottest shows ever.  urlLink Off went the shirts . I think we played our set really well, except for a few technical difficulties we had during the first two songs. At the show I got to chill a bit with Sarah from Milburn who is just the nicest girl. Afterwards, Chris drove Jon, Guy, Kate and I to Taco Bell for some awesome 1/2 lb. Bean Burrito Especials, and some oh-so pleasant dinner conversations. I got home at some awful hour and went straight to bed, ignoring the mess of wires, plastic and solder on my desk that had at one point been an Xbox controller.  I woke up this morning at a lazy time, and got some messages from Guy saying that a band had dropped out and that we had been asked to play the show tonight. I thought it was a good idea and so did the rest of KP, so we decided that we would eventually meet up and get our shit together. Just before I left though, I talked to a new acquaintance of mine, who told me he'd be able to help me with my Xbox modification. As KP coagulated at the Baird Center it donned on me how much I love playing in the heat. After a bit of fretting over the PA system, we were able to relax a bit and hang with the wonderful  urlLink Notrock ers who dropped by.   Hunger lead to a pick-up order from Pirate Pizza which lead to some nice conversations with Adam and Liz at a red checkered table. Adam is really a wonderful person, and I wish everybody could meet him. I don't mean to inflate him though, he's just really charmingly unblemished by negative characteristics. I told him about my plans.   Goldy and I have decided we'd like to work together to produce a comic and a CD, that are to be experienced together. One would read the comic which contains several small stories, and each of these stories would have an assigned track on the accompanying CD. We haven't decided on the music though. It might be an awesome mix or something home-brewed. I think the combo should be titled Aural [heart] Visual.   We were motivated to play an extra-special and efficiently paced 10-minute set, which involved me getting shocked I think a bit too badly, by an odd acting instrument cable connected to my charged amplifier. As soon as we left the stage  urlLink Khantra  began their explosive act and got me to dance. They're one of the very few bands that can do that, and I really appreciated it.  Following the deconstruction of the show, Mr. Danger Takahashi was kind enough to take Allie, Logan, Kate, Jon, Guy and I out to a late night dinner at IHOP, where I drank possibly 3 too many strawberry iced teas. The ride home was filled with merriment and lots of pen-on-Jono action. Good times with good people.  As I got home tonight I talked to my acquaintance again, who was surprisingly helpful and patient in helping me get the illegal files I needed and setting up my machine. Pretty son thanks to him I will be basking in the glow of an Xbox fitted out with a running  urlLink EvoX  dashboard.  Those were my days.

      If I put quotation marks around things, like the title, does it make it seem more meaningful or reputable?  "Today brings me one day closer to summer, which in turn is looking less and less like the summers of yesteryear. I've got but three finals left, and then I'm free for a week. Then it's back in the slammer for four weeks, for 6 hours a day, flexing my camera arm. It's sounding more and more labor intensive though, as today Mr. G mentioned set construction. Now, I'm no film surgeon, but that sounds like a job for lowly grips, and I'm no grip.  The other day I was lucky enough to receive an invitation to the Beta-testing of  urlLink Gmail ,  urlLink Google 's venture into the world of free mail hosting. The service runs without a client through a web browser of your preference (mine is  urlLink Mozilla ), which makes it accessible through most any computer, and offers an impregnable 1 gigabyte of storage, which means you'll never have to delete a message. Gmail also organizes mail into conversations, much like a forum, which makes it a lot easier for back tracking, rather than switching between Inbox and Sent folders. I happened to acquire my invite through the wonderful  urlLink Gmail Swap , so go check it out if you want try and snag your own. Eventually I should be given a few invitations, which I can give back to the community that gave so much to me. In return for an invite, I offered to mail a Travel Journal to the generous donor. "What's a travel journal" you ask?, well..  A travel journal is a notebook or scrap book that is passed one from one person to another, each filling out a few pages with whatever they want, until the book is filled and returned to the originator. I learned about these through the  urlLink 1000 Journals  project, which has been going on for quite a long time now, and has an ever expanding collection returned books to browse the pages of. Quite inspiring stuff. I plan to mail away my first blank journal as soon as I can get some gaffer's tape to toughen up the cover. The recipient happens to live in Japan, so I'm expecting some wacky shit in return. Perhaps I should include instructions in Japanese as well? My friend in Nishinomiya can help me out with that.  ON the subject of journals, I've started one containing all my notes in regards to modding my little Xbox. I plan to go the way of a chipless-mod, based on an exploit within MechAssault. The tutorial I'm using can be found  urlLink here , written by the experienced "Mad_Gouki", and recommended by the famous  urlLink Kevin Rose . Pretty soon, If I can do it right, my Xbox will be able to backup my games to its HDD, run a media player, emulate the classics like SNES and Genesis, and even run a web browser, through which (using the awesome Gmail) I can check my messages.  I'm really proud the way all my topics were connected, it makes me feel competent."

      Today's been weird to say the least.  I woke up really really late, I'm talking like 4:30 in the afternoon, even though I went to bed as soon as I got home last night, at like 11:00 or 12:00. This has thrown off my inner clock considerably, and will probably not be good for getting to sleep at an appropriate time tonight. I vaguely remember waking up to my alarm clock at 7:00 or so, walking across the room, unplugging it, and throwing it out the door into some laundry. Luckily, it was not wounded.  After dragging myself out of bed, I wandered around my empty house for a bit, stopping to set up the wonderfully full-featured  urlLink Thunderbird  on my laptop, and to download some more old school SNES games, like Super Metroid and Mario All Stars. I prefer to use the SNES emulator  urlLink ZSNES , as it has a very simple interface and a nice save-state feuture.  I then considered for a split second the possibility of studying for finals: DENIED.  Jon stopped by around 6:00, and we hung out briefly, talking about Fugazi, The Simpsons, and how everything is nicer in Japan, even their rip-offs.

      I'm feeling pretty proud right now. I have a somewhat solid idea of what I want to be doing for the next year of my life or so. It feels good to have a mental road  map for once, sort of like being prepared with food for an long storm. The agenda is as follows.   1 day from now:  Singing someone else's song on Floods Hill.  1 month from now:  I'll be sitting in my film class with Boris G.  2 months from now:  I'll be up in Maine building a house, or just relaxing. The awesome type of relaxation that I can achieve nowhere else.  3 months from now:  Start up my junior year at CHS, and hopefully get into all the classes I wanted, allowing me to enjoy my education.  4 months from now:  Applying to college, like I'm some big tough educated citizen.  6 months and 6 days from now:  Passing my road test and receiving my restricted license.  [records lost....]   12 months from now:  Claiming I have it all figured out.  So yeah, hopefully nothing in that plan goes  too wrong , and hopefully I survive through the murky second six months.  I went to see  urlLink khantra  with Goldy and Jon today, and it was a really good show I think. Some of the bands weren't that note worthy, but I got to hear  urlLink Gotlieb  and really enjoyed them. Time was running short quick, but the boys of Khantra were still able to pull off an amazing set as per usual. I so wish that I could see them play more often. Luckily, I get to see the once in a lifetime live performance of  urlLink Insouciant  tomorrow, and am ready to be blown so far away. We're also planning a cool little lunch for their band and ours at Jon's. So much fun will be had, which is why I'm going to go to bed now, and rest up. If you want to see us play, we'll be on sometime between 1:00 and 4:00 PM, followed immediately by the incredible Insouciant, so be sure to stop by.

      The Baird Center called me yesterday to let me know that, if I still wanted one, I could get a job working there over the summer as a camp counselor. It'd be with kids from the ago of like 6 to 11, and for most of the day. I could expect just over minimum wage, and an eventual meltdown from over-exposure to adolescence. One problem with that plan is that since applying, I've signed up for a film course over the summer at the high-school. This will occupy my days from 9 until 3 for the whole month of July. I've also made a commitment to my dad to assist in the construction of a second house up at the camp in Maine during August. So my options come down to this;  A) Damn kids and canceling my visit to the great open North and Film County, USA, or B) No damn kids, some worthwhile education, and a great time with the pops.  No doubt, I'll go with the film and construction. The point of the story, is that I was given a job, I'm going to decline it as soon as possible, but I was still given a job. I hope my mom takes this the same way. I'll also most likely make more working for my dad for two weeks, than I would working for the Baird for a month.  Of course all this talk of jobs and money is just so I can pay for my car insurance. Most of my friends' parents will be paying for theirs, but not me. I guess $800 a year isn't that bad though, and it is giving me a more realistic idea of what paying for my own expenses is like. Also, without it, I'd never get to  drive .  I certainly didn't expect the lead singer from Harvey Danger to look like such a damn  urlLink nerd . Same thing with the guy from Barenaked Ladies. Didn't anyone tell them that you can't wear glasses and have parted hair unless it's a cruel joke?  Here's concept for a film/video. The screen is split in half, either top/bottom, or left/right, and it is two different little stories in each. The thing that connects them though is that they both have the exact same camera movements, and they're perfectly synced up. So for example, while one is panning left across a scene of a crowd milling about outside a train station, the other is panning left following somebody walking down a hallway. Then, at the exact same moment, both cameras stop panning and turn right sharply. It might be impossible for me to make, but I like to imagine it could work, and that the two stories would be interesting. It also demands an awesome sound-track.  Today I'm supposed to be working on my final projects for both Spanish and physics, but instead I'm just taking naps and eating. I've also started taking things apart, like transformers toys and my Super Nintendo. Luckily, I was able to put the SNES back together with no harm done, but the decepticon wasn't so lucky...

      School has lost its once sexy appeal. It's now quite un-exciting, and there are long awkward pauses where neither of us says anything. I think this little fling with summer might actually do me some good.   If you don't look time travels so fast We'll have no time for now we got relaxed  (Hope you caught my trick nasty tenses)  The lone walk home was so much dryer The higher liars are all combusting   That's an awesome poem. I wrote it just for you, my sugar-momma.  So in actual heartsmacky related news, I've decided I'm going to make something tangible for all of you. It'll be both a book of sights and a CD of sounds. Expect it to be free and thus, poorly made. It will however make you a better person, like all heartsmackings. Below is just an example of the theme of the booklet. I reckon it'll be a self-improvement book about broken bones and hearts too.   urlLink    I might do as the  urlLink Notrock ers do,  (by the way, check out that hot new site design, it's so fancy!) , and print it on colored paper, but that's one more thing to do, so I figure it'll be plain white, and not brown in the background. I've also decided that parellel to this project, I will complete my redesign of the heartsmacky site. I really like the way the new  urlLink front page  turned out, and plan to use that theme for all site navigation, so expect lots of cool new graphic interfaces. I'm also going to be uploading some hot music too, that you'll be able to download without killing the site. Maybe it's time I switch to something besides geocities for my hearthosting needs? I should talk to Eric about what hosting those Notrockers use, I think it's  urlLink Echoecho . Hopefully it's also cheap.

        This Morning:  Made myself some egg-in-the-middles, got to class late.       Film Class:  Finished filming some pickup shots and others we forgot, or atleast that we had   imagined   that we shot.     Lunch:  Rode bikes with Goldy to the church sale and picked up a single shoulder backpack for 2 bucks. It's the greatest.      After Class:  Rode to the train station with Goldy, and saw Emily, Kate and Logan, and it was awkward for some reason. Or maybe it was awkward before I got there, I don't know.     After Awkward:  Talked to Zack about Stalker, and showed him my cool new bag. I also figured out how to use it in conjunction with my iPod's remote. Now I can ride and change the song / play-pause / change the volume, it's really nifty.       Dinner:  Promised to let my mom borrow my iPod for her trip to Italy. I have no idea what I'm going to do without it. What a mistake.    Goodnight.

      Today was bitter-sweet. It's was a wonderful day, I just sort of like the taste of bitter-sweet food.  Woke up early before my alarm, and spent a while  really really  relaxing. It was enlightening. Then my alarm went off, blasting "Chandeliers Should Only Fall On Villains" by the delectable  urlLink Khantra . In a purely reflexive move I leaped out of my bed and grabbed my alarm clock/CD player. Then I threw it into a chair in the other room, and it turned off. Have I mentioned how awesome a song "Chandeliers Should Only Fall On Villains" by  urlLink Khantra  is? It's possibly the greatest alarm I could ever ask for.  Made myself some Applejacks and waffles for breakfast. A truly well-rounded meal, accompanied by a short film titled " urlLink The Girl In The Red Dress ". It was a lovely way to start the day.   Rode my bike to school, aware that my rear-brake was broken. One of the spring-arms for the brake pads is broken, so it is constantly rubbing against the tire. Not so hard that I can't ride, just hard enough to make me furiously inefficient. I felt at least 2 drops of rain.  Class was spent talking and editing. The "teaching assistant" Gabe brought in a copy of The New York Times Magazine which had this great  urlLink article  about comics in it. I had read half of it yesterday and finished it today in Mr. G.'s office. We talked about comics Goldy and I enjoyed, and I'm going to be bringing some in tomorrow to let Gabe borrow. In exchange, he's going to lend me one of his college psych textbooks, and maybe take me to his college (Bard) some day to sit in on their cool cool curriculum. I also told Gabe about the 24-hour comic I did, and he said I should bring it in. So I think tomorrow, I'm going to stop by Jeff's new place on the way to school, and pick it up.  When class was out, it was raining somewhat, so I thought my ride home would be dangerous and miserable, but my tires handled it, and it was actually really fun. I found myself grinning madly as I exploded through puddles and drank all the drops that hit my mouth. As I passed the post office, I realized Andy surely would have received her package by now, and guess what I found when I got home? A reply letter, so sweet of her.  As the early evening rolled around my dog kindly asked of me to feed and walk her, which I did. I wore a raincoat and shorts outside, with  no shoes . It was fun. I  really really  enjoy the rain.

      Populated with knives!"   I'm back to blogging friends, don't you worry. I've just been a bit distracted lately. Doing:   A) Film class is awesome. We've finished shooting one film and started  on our second. I Really enjoy imagining the story through a camera  filter, and planning out the scenes and shot and angles and my oh my,  it just gets me  hot.    B) bicycles are fun. I've been exploring, all the way out to the  boonies of Short Hills, and West Orange in the opposite direction. I've  ridden a bit with Goldy, but I'm not so sure he shares my passion for  riding as far as possible. Maybe Dip will come with me to the end of  the world.   C) Camps are hours away. So much time went into making a package for  Andy, but I got it shipped out today from Mail Boxes Etc., and it felt  good. It consists of two letters written about a week apart, 17 CD's,  and one of my favorite comics. I wrapped it in a piece of newsprint  which I had drawn over and colored in one of the pictures of. It's also  wrapped with a bow.   D) Church sales are great. I haven't gotten that many clothes because  I'm broke, but the few shirts I've bought are just wonderful. All of  them are especially light for the upcoming heat. I still only own 3 or  4 pairs of shorts though. Maybe it's time I cut me some new ones.   "Alright pants, It's go-time, just you and me, and the scissors"  "Pants pants pants pants!"  "Shut the hell up you!" Cutting ensues...   I got a copy of "A Ghost Is Born" by Wilco from my dad the other day. I  really like it, and am starting to really get into Wilco.   Next on my agenda this afternoon is to go clean out my car a bit. It's  got weird stuff growing and stinking it up, since it's been untouched  for so long. I sure hope I can get it so fresh and so clean.   Sorry if I've been brief, but the Windex and Febreeze is calling to me.   xoxo - Jono
