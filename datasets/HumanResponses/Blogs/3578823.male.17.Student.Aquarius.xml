      I believe I have to energy left...I dunno if it is still there. My neck muscles are sore because of the way I lift my arms with my should while I walk sometimes(partly out of habit, but it makes my neck muscles BULGE), they are gaining the muscle which they lost over the past few months. My arms are kind of sore due to the lifting yesterday. And my legs are sore as freakin' crap! I can't really walk anywhere because they hurt so much. We got to go to our Centers today(A center is a 3-hour class that is kind of like your major for the summer), mine is ThinkQuest, which means I get to make a website with 2 other people, and then submit it for judging, and hope we win something. Although we pretty much got it in the bag, with me on orginization and media, Cirox(Andrew W. Co-Founder of Infinigeeks.com) , and some really lucky guy/girl to do some research(we already have a 5-page research paper on it, so there really isn't a lot to research), it's a gimme. We are going to research Chemical Weapons Disposal, it's a huge local issue here, and a pretty moderate issue internationally. Should be quite interesting. We also got to sign up for our afternoon classes, which I am taking 2 afternoon classes(math and futurebuilding..), and two night classes which I am especially looking forward too(Geology, and Video Production). We get to try out the classes on Thursday, I can't wait. Ah... Tomorrow is the Mystery Trip, so I will not be updating the blog for 2 days, so don't think I died or anything...Not that anyone reads this ANYWAYS. Sigh...   Word of the day--Equanimity:ee-kwuh-NIM-uh-tee; ek-wuh-:[noun] Evenness of mind; calmness; composure; as, "to bear misfortunes with equanimity."

      Wow, it's been such a rough day. I haven't done anything physical in 4 weeks...and then BAM, I come here and have to drag my 35-Pound computer(and the monitor), my backpack, my suitcase, and some other crap up to the 3rd freakin' floor.I was all sweaty and tired before anything really began. I met my counselee group and I'm unsure if I will really be able to befriend them, moreso that they might not want to befriend me. My Tutor Counseler is pretty cool so far, I can already tell that he's going to make my summer better by his attitude. The food here is the same as always, and I've seen a lot of familiar faces, and a lot of new ones. I hope I can meet them all..hehe. And I also got to play Ultimate Frisbee today!!! I *heart* UB.   Word of the day--Bedizen:bih-DY-zuhn:[transitive verb] To dress or adorn in gaudy manner.

      I thought I'd take a time out from our intense gaming session to add something in here. I'm at a friends house right now attending a small LAN Party. We are going to be here all night long, until 12am tomorrow. I don't think this is so bright seeing as I have to take the ACT tomorrow. And I have to shop and pack like a mo all day tomorrow because Upward Bound is Sunday. OH YEAH. In other news...INFINIGEEKS.COM IS BACK UP. That's right folks, after a whole 2 months, Infinigeeks is back. It took us forEVER...but we are glad it's back(when I say 'we', I'm referring to myself and my friend el Andrew Waltino[andrew walton for short]).

      I've been waiting for this day for such a long time. I've received an invitation to join gmail, googles new e-mail system. And it owns me so much...Enough will the gloating though...  I've been having this problem with a webhosting company named  urlLink FuitadNET . I bought a small $5 package from them May 25th 2004, and I think I gave them the wrong DomainEPP(whatever the heck that is), so the original domain I wanted to use(infinigeeks.org) couldn't be used. Then I 'forgot' my password to the billing area thing, and I had to get LiveHelp with that, and that took half an hour to get the password restored. So instead, I queried them for about a week seeing if they could help. Well, I finally gave up because I was getting nowhere with them, so I asked them if I could just order another domain instead; they said it was an extra $2.50(you're ripping me off, but okay, I'll play you're game, it's only $2.50). Well, they set that up FINALLY on Sunday(waited 3 days for them to get around to setting it up). The welcome e-mail said that the domain could take up to 48 hours to become active(okay, I understand that, I'll wait..) Well..that was Sunday...it is now Thursday, 96 hours. I waited until now till I asked them for help again, I thought the problem would solve itself. No. So now, I am trying to get in on livehelp(no luck, they're ALWAYS full, or maybe it's just there for looks), but I just typed up a ticket for them, so that should get them going. HOPEFULLY the problem gets fixed this time and there are no more future problems. If so, I'm packing up and leaving. I may go back to  urlLink Addaction . Either way, it's bed time. Lol. Night.

      I see all these people writing whole novels in one of their blog posts, with their nostalgic ideas and superfluous day. Seeing as if I could even have a even nice day in the few days past or few days in the future, or even had any cool ideas I could share with the group. Hell, I wish I could talk about something funny that happened to me today. But no, I've been sitting in front of my computer for about *looks at watch* 3 weeks now. Considering I made  few  trips. Last saturday I went to see the new  Harry Potter  movie. I found it to be pretty swell. A couple days before that, I actually got to go to Wal*Mart! *Sigh*. And the weekend before that I attended a 24-Hour LAN party at a friends house. That has been my summer thus far. With only 4 days to go till UB...Oh yeah, UB is short for "Upward Bound". This is a government funded program ran by dedicated employees who work year-round to make sure everyone is doing well in school and home. In the summer, a group of high schoolers(sophmores to just graduated seniors)come together to live on a college campus(in this case,  urlLink Berea College ) for a total of 6 weeks(we get 1 week to go home after the 3rd week, and then come back for the remainder). We go there and take different classes that can help improve our academic composition, and they help us with anything we need. It's really beneficial. Oh, and they pay us to be in it. That's right, every week you are there in the summer they give you $20, plus extra money during trips to eat and shop. And they pay us during the year to go to reunions and such. Wow, I guess I can talk about a lot(even though that's not really a lot). Eh, I guess talking about how people talk to much can end up getting pretty long. That'll be it for now. Auf Wiedersehen!   Word of the day--Braggadocio[Noun]  A Braggart; Empty Boasting; A Swaggering, Cocky Manner.

      I've spent the past 4 hours perusing  urlLink Orkut . I just got an invite to it earlier. It's really quite nice.  5 Days left till Upward Bound starts, and I've been bored out of my mind for the past 3 weeks. I've been playing MEdal of Honor constantly, I believe I've become fairly good at it, especially online. Speaking of MOH...I'll post a follow-up later, gonna play mohaa(medal of honor allied assualt). Later.
