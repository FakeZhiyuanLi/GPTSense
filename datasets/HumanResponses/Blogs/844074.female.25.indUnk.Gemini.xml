          The last few days, I've been spending way too much time building... and building... and building. Oi. I did manage to hang out at a couple Show and Tells with Zap, but!  The fruits of my labor shall soon be tasted! Oh how sweet they shall be. Alright, so I'm going overboard trying to build on my little 512 parcel of land. I've had a lot of fun though, and it teaches me a bit about 3d world-building, object manipulation, and texturing. Perhaps on a small level, but a level nonetheless! I've come to greatly appreciate the object creation toolset in SL, as it really is easy to use once you get the hang of it. And after countless hours trying to build something resembling  urlLink a house , I've gotten the hang of it.  Technically, there will be three floors to it.. somehow.  I got a  urlLink stroke of genius  and decided to "dig out a basement" for even more variety in theme. 512 isn't that big, once you start letting your eyes pop out of your head, and I want as much variety as I can get, in this little lot. I have a feeling it will end up leaning towards "gothic" though. But not overly so.. graveyards and such are a bit overboard for me. I'll keep it nice and neat I think.  There's a lot of work to do, and when I'm finished, I plan to publish a more detailed article on it, featuring specifics, some textures used, and what not. But for now, just a taste.

            And so it seems that I've actually managed to finish this layout today. Many thanks to all the template authors that have submitted their templates to Blogger. I learned a lot, probably more than I had bargained for.  I think everything's working.. hopefully.   ^.^  I had to completely redo the template, as it's been practically forever since I last used Blogger or Blogger code. Needless to say, it did kick my arse until I realized I'd have to steer all of the site's content with the style-sheet. Ewps. No hot-wiring this time! A few tweaks here and there, and I think I can probably make everything work in both IE in addition to Firefox(the browser I primarily use).  Content coming soon!  And there's  lots  of it.

          Today went by faster than a speeding bullet.  Goodness. In any case, at least I got way more done than I thought I would. While milling about my house in Poliahu, I checked the events calendar, and noticed a little goth get-together was in 2 hours. First of all, I'm not exactly a goth, I wouldn't call myself a goth... but considering my second life centers around a shady near-vampire with black hair and pale skin, and a love of the color black... I figured hey, I can dig it. Needless to say I'm sort of "half goth"... dig the darkness, too lazy to make it my life goal. ;)  I had nothing to wear though.  There  was  going to be "best outlandish costume" contest, but I wasn't overly concerned with that. I just wanted something neat to wear besides my pleather pants and top. I also didn't want to go buy something. I'm really stingy when it comes to clothing.. part of me just wants to make my own stuff.  I spent about an hour on a little  urlLink blood-reddish number . It was also the first real skirt I tackled. I was a bit proud of myself for getting the skirt right on the first try, normally I have to re-edit and re-edit to get seams correct. The top also turned out great once I lined up the seams. This particular top is based on my leather bra. I liked it so much that I'll be saving that alpha for future designs.  Almost tattered, slightly gauzy, dried-blood red 'skirt', check. Matching sleeveless top with spider clasp in back, check. Mockup black lace stockings, check. Thigh-high leather boots, check!  I headed over to The Pit and proceeded to partay. Unfortunately, the owner wasn't around and the poor land-stream was set to some hip-hop/pop station. Kinda killed the goth mood, but  urlLink we had fun . Pancake Stryker took first prize, and so... she had a cute fluffy periodish gown. It was nice getting out again, I haven't been to many events in total and can easily become a recluse if left to my own machinations (read: texturing/building).    Coming up next?  A close look at a body skin...

          Today didn't start off to my liking, but after a small nap (to get rid of that "must be a cold" body ache), things picked up rather well! And even though I've spent a grand estimated total of 300 L$, I'm fairly happy with this week's work.  The house was really beginning to annoy me, as I just didn't know where to go with it, was running out of prim-space, and really wanted to have at least a minimal amount of prim-space left for future item creations. I added a front "entrance",  urlLink another painting, a bed, and a desk .  The bed was soooo much fun to make, too.  But today and yesterday was spent with texturing. Mostly myself(body skin), and developing a clean bra alpha. First, I decided that some realistic breasts were necessary. Uhm, mainly for my own amusement, as I don't think I could ever go around nude anywhere! However, they do look great with semi-revealing clothing. I still have  urlLink some tweaking to do , though, especially around the inner thighs. I'm at least done with the  urlLink facial part  of it. The skin is loosely based upon a character I play in Anarchy Online, and while the idea is similar, I took off with it and altered to my own desires, adding much more color contrasts, peach-hued blushed areas on the skin, etcetera. I mean, wow, give me the chance to fully visually flesh out a character I've had in my head for 6 years?! Hello nurse!  I can't wait until I perfect that skin though, once everything's in the right spot, all that'll be needed are tone and hue adjustments if I make any other avatars... well, female avatars. I intend, in the near future, to alter it to fit a male avatar... I'm a sucker for  a good looking vampire , for instance.  Before dinner time rolled around though, I did finish my  urlLink bra texture  at least! It matches my leather panty. *nods sagely* What's amusing about all this is, I don't care much about style, fashion, or clothings in my "1st Life". I guess it's the artiste in me; visual freedom is intoxicating.
