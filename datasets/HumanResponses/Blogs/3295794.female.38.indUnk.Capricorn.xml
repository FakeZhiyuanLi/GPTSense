						   Cooking Tips   It is not always necessary to preheat your oven. If the cooking time is less  than an hour, then 5 minutes of preheating will do. If the cooking time is  more than an hour, just turn on the oven when you place the dish inside.   Make several dishes and cook them all in the oven at the same time. You can  compensate for different temperatures by setting it somewhere in the middle and  adjusting the cooking time.   When baking, don't open your oven more than necessary. It wastes energy and  increases your cooking time.   You can lower the oven heat by 25 degrees F. if you use glass or ceramic  baking dishes which retain heat better than metal.   Turn off your oven several minutes before your dish is done and let the  remaining heat finish the cooking.   When cooking over a gas stove, adjust the flame so that it just touches the  bottom of the pot and doesn't go over the sides. The flame should be blue and  cone shaped.   When using an electric stove, use a pot that is about the same size or a  little bigger than the element. A pot that is 2 inches smaller will waste about  40% of the heat. Generally, you should use the smallest pot you can.   Use a lid on your pot to reduce cooking time. Also, a dish can still simmer  in the heat that remains immediately after you turn it off.   Keep the drip pans under the burners clean to reflect the heat back up to the  pot. Black drip pans absorb heat and reduce the efficiency of the burner.   ~spots.ab.ca

						   Basic Tomato Preparation  Peel  Peeling fresh tomatoes is not necessary, unless the fruit is to be cooked.  Heat causes skins to slip away from the flesh, so it is best to peel a tomato  before adding it to a heated dish. To peel fresh tomatoes, submerge them in a  bowl of boiling water for about 30 seconds. Transfer to cold water and the  skins will slip off.  Seed Scrape seeds away from the flesh with a pointed utensil, such as a grapefruit  spoon, being careful not to puncture skin.  NOTE: Tomato seeds contain significant nutritional qualities and few recipes  are affected by seeds. Avoid seeding if possible.  Slice Using a serrated knife, slice tomatoes lengthwise, rather than crosswise, to  retain juice.  Stuff  Cut off stem end and scoop out seeds and pulp with sharp utensil, such as a  grapefruit spoon, being careful not to puncture skin. Sprinkle the cavity  lightly with salt and turn upside down on a paper towel to drain.  Stew  Place peeled whole or cut-up tomatoes in a saucepan without water. Season  with salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar; add diced onion or green pepper, if  desired. Simmer, tightly covered, over low heat until done, 10 to 15 minutes,  stirring occasionally.  Broil Remove core, halve crosswise or slice. Dot with butter; sprinkle with salt,  pepper or other seasonings. Broil until tomatoes are tender and topping is  lightly browned.  Bake Halve crosswise, dot with butter and season as desired. Bake in hot oven (425  F) 10 to 15 minutes.  Microwave  Prepare as directed above for baking and microwave on high (100% Power) 3 to  4 minutes for four halves; 5 to 6 minutes for six to eight halves.  Tomato Equivalents 3 to 4 medium tomatoes weigh about 1 pound. 1 pound of fresh tomatoes, peeled  and seeded, will produce about 1 1/2 cups pulp.  Serving Tips *Use ripe, red tomatoes first; they have the most flavor.  *Fully ripe tomatoes will be firm, but will give slightly to gentle palm  pressure.  *To peel, submerge tomatoes in boiling water for 30 seconds, then plunge into  cold water, drain and slip off skins.  *Sharpen tomato slicing utensils regularly.  *Do not seed tomatoes; seeds contain significant nutritional benefits.   ~tomato.org

						   1. Start a Price Book:  Most people will agree that this is one of the best ways to compare  compare  prices. I first learned about price books in the first book of The  Tightwad  Gazette series by Amy Dacyczyn in which she goes into great detail  about  starting and maintaining a price book. By using a price book you can  compare  prices and get the most value for your dollar. I use a loose leaf  binder and  I have a separate page for each item. I list the prices for each  store that I  frequent. It is also helpful to put the price per ounce since sizes  of items  may differ from store to store. Starting a price book takes time and  commitment in the beginning but once you have it done it will become  a  valuable tool to use to save money. You can start off by just keeping  all  your receipts and then mark the prices in your price book.  2. Buy Your Bread at Bread Thrift Shops  I don't go every week since I can freeze enough to last me a couple  of weeks.  I can get bread at the thrift store for half of what it costs in the  grocery  store.  3. Check for Items that are Reduced for Quick Sale  Make friends with the butcher at the grocery store and find out when  the  meats are put out and marked for quick sale. If the meat expires that  day or  the next day it will be reduced sometimes as much as 50 percent. Just  be sure  to either use it that day or immediately freeze it. You can also find  produce  reduced for quick sale.  4. Shop the Loss Leader Sales  Loss leaders are items on sale in which the store does not expect to  make a  profit. Loss leaders have the purpose of attracting you into their  store so  you will buy your other items there. Take advantage of loss leaders  and stock  up when items you want are greatly reduced.  5. Carry a Small Calculator with You to the Store  Sometimes the larger item is not always the least expensive per  ounce.  6. Watch the Cash Register  Sometimes the correct sales price is not input into the computer  system. They  do make mistakes because I have caught errors several times. If you  find it  impossible to look as the cashier rings up your total try to examine  your  receipt before you leave the store.  7. Be Cautious of Buying Clubs  Be aware that buying clubs like Cotsco or Sams Club do not always  save you  money. Some items are actually higher than what you could get if you  purchased store brands. Some people tend to purchase too much snack  food and  convenience food which tend to run up the food budget. Keeping a  price book  as I stated earlier will help you determine what the bargains are.  Cheese is  one of the items that I have found to be less expensive at Sams. You  can get  good deals on books and also software. Unless you do a lot of  shopping at  these buying clubs the cost of the membership is not worth it. At  some of  these clubs you pay as much as $35.00 so you would have to spend $700  to  recoup the membership fee. I wait until Walmart runs an ad for a free  admission to Sams for one day and buy what I want then. They run  these ads  about every three months.  8. Buy Store Brands Rather Than Name Brands  I have found store brands to be 25 to 30 percent lower than the name  brands.  Some of these store brands are manufactured in the same plants as the  name  brands.  9. Use Coupons Wisely  Use coupons on the days when the coupon will be doubled. Only use a  coupon on  a product that you and your family will use and use a coupon only if  it will  make the price lower than the store brands. Also, use your coupons in  conjunction with loss leader sales. You can often get the item free  when  using these strategies.  10. Shop in Season for Fruits and Vegetables  11. Consider Growing a Garden  You don't really need a large yard to grow a garden. Ever heard of  square  foot gardening? The produce you grow tastes so much better and it's  healthier  for you too!  12. Give up Non Nutritional Food  Imagine all the money you would save if you did not spend it on  potato chips,  cokes, cookies, and candies.  13. Brown Bag Your Lunches  Until recently my husband was buying his lunch out until I found out  that it  was costing him an average of 15 to 20 dollars a week. I now take  time to  pack him a lunch. He is more than happy to eat last night's  leftovers.  14. Learn to Cook from Scratch  15. Don't Shop When You Are Hungry  All kinds of things will find their way into your cart when you are  hungry.  16. Have More Meatless Meals  You don't need meat three times a day. For a change why not beans and  rice?  Consult a vegetarian cookbook for other ways to incorporate meatless  meals  into your menus.  17. Puree Your Own Baby Food  Homemade baby food is very easy to make. You can steam the vegetables  and  then freeze the contents in ice trays. You then store the frozen  puree cubes  in baggies and just pop what you think baby will eat in the  microwave.  18. Breast Feed Your Infant  If a woman is able she should consider this as an option. The price  of infant  formula is costly. Not only is breast feeding frugal, it's always  available,  the right temperature, and it's healthy for both the baby and the  mother.  Breast fed babies are less likely to get ill so you save on doctor's  bills.  19. Learn to be Creative With Leftovers  Recycle leftovers into new dishes. Those leftover veggies can be  frozen and  you can have stew.  20. Some Stores Honor Competitor's Ads  The Super Walmart where I shop will honor another store's ads. I just  take  the ad in with me and show it to the cashier.  21. Eliminate Alcoholic Beverages  Alcohol is expensive and eats a big bite out of your food budget.  22. If You Eat Out Eat Lunch Instead of Diner  Lunch at most restaurants is less expensive then the dinner menu.  Also find  out the days when your favorite restaurants run specials and eat  those days.  Some restaurants have a kids eat free night.  23. Weigh your Pre-bagged Produce  For example a head of lettuce is priced at 59 cents. Try weighing  different  heads of lettuce and put the heavier one in your basket. The same  applies to  10 pound bags of potatoes or anything else bagged up. Always get the  heavier  bag.  24. Visit Web Pages of Food Companies  Sign their guest books and receive free coupons and free samples of  products  in the mail.  25. Check in the Store for Rebates  Use this strategy only if you can save money over buying store  brands.  26. Buy Economy Sizes and Divide  I buy the gallon size can of ketchup. I then put it washed out  containers of  grape juice bottles and refrigerate.  27. Get Involved with a Food Co-op  Get your friends and family to go in together and purchase items in  bulk. To  learn more about food buying co-ops you can call the National  Cooperative  Business Association at 1-800-636-6222.  28. Let Your Child Take His Lunch to School  29. Give Up Convenience Food  30. Don't Waste Food  How many times have you put something in the refrigerator and forgot  about it  until it turned green? Try to have things labeled in your  refrigerator so  that nothing goes to waste. You need to be aware of the length of  time that  you can keep items in the refrigerator before they need to be thrown  out.

						   Three Shopping Lists   Never go to the grocery store without a list. And never go for "just one thing" if you can possibly avoid it. The reasons are: without a list, you are at the mercy of the store's merchandising program and your own memory. You're liable to buy the whole farm by the time you get home. It's a similar problem with going to the store for "just one thing". You may be tempted to "impulse buy". Don't! Just Say No Way to busting your food budget.

						   CROCKPOT 101  The crockpot or slow cooker is one of the best time saving appliances in the kitchen. It's great for beginning cooks because all you have to do is fill it and turn it on. Hours later, you come home to a house filled with wonderful smells and dinner ready for the table. Here are some basic tips about using your crockpot.  BASIC TIPS    a.. When purchasing a crockpot, look for one with a removable liner. They are much easier to clean. If you have a nonremovable liner, however, all is not lost! Line your crockpot with a cooking bag and you'll have no cleanup at all. Spray the inside of the liner with cooking spray before you fill it to make cleanup easier.   b.. Only fill the crockpot one half to three quarters full. The foods will not cook properly if the appliance is filled to the brim. If the food and liquid level is lower, the foods will cook too quickly.   c.. Foods cooked on the bottom of the slow cooker cook faster and will be moister because they are immersed in the simmering liquid.   d.. Remove skin from poultry, and trim excess fat from meats. Fats will melt with long cooking times, and will add an unpleasant texture to the finished dish. Fatty foods will also cook too quickly.   e.. You can thicken the juices and concentrate flavors by removing the lid and cooking on HIGH for the last half hour of cooking time.   f.. 140 degrees is the temperature the food needs to reach as quickly as possible. If you are at home during the cooking times, test the food temperature after four hours of cooking on LOW - the temp should be at least 140 degrees. If it isn't, there's a problem with your crockpot and you should get a new one.   g.. For food safety reasons, it's a good idea to cook on HIGH for the first hour to quickly bring the temperature up to 140 degrees. Then turn the dial to LOW and finish cooking.   h.. The LOW setting is about 200 degrees, and the HIGH setting is about 300 degrees. Note that both of these temps are well above the minimum safe temperature of 140 degrees.   i.. Don't put frozen foods in the microwave. All foods should be defrosted before cooking so the food temperature can reach 140 degrees as soon as possible.   j.. Most meats require 8 hours of cooking on LOW. Use cheaper cuts of meat - not only do you save money, but these meats work better in the slow cooker. Cheaper cuts of meat have less fat, which makes them more suited to crockpot cooking. Moist, long cooking times result in very tender meats.   k.. Ground meats must be cooked in a skillet before cooking in the crockpot.   l.. Seafood should be added during the last hour of cooking time,or it will overcook and have a rubbery texture.   m.. Large pieces of meat can be browned before cooking in the crockpot, but this step isn't necessary. Browning adds color and helps in flavor development.   n.. One hour on HIGH is equal to two hours on LOW.   o.. Cayenne pepper and tabasco sauce tend to become bitter if cooked for long periods of time. Use small amounts and add toward the end of the cooking time.   p.. Add tender vegetables like tomatoes, mushrooms and zucchini during the last 45 minutes of cooking time so they don't overcook.   q.. Dairy products should be added during the last 30 minutes of cooking time, unless the recipes states otherwise.   r.. Liquids do not boil away in the crockpot, so if you are making a recipe that wasn't specifically developed for the crockpot, reduce the liquid by 1/3 to 1/2 unless you are cooking rice or making soup.   s.. Remove cooked food from the crockpot or liner before storage. Because the liner is made of such thick material, the food won't cool down quickly enough to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria.   t.. Stir in spices for the last hour of cooking. They will lose flavor if cooked with the rest of the ingredients for the long cooking period.   u.. Follow the layering instructions carefully. Vegetables do not cook as quickly as meat, so they should be placed in the bottom of the appliance.   v.. Don't lift the lid to stir, especially if you are cooking on the low setting. Each time you lift the lid, enough heat will escape that the cooking time should be extended by 20 minutes to half an hour. To check progress without lifting the lid, spin the cover until the condensation falls off. Then it's easy to see inside.

						   Low Carb New York Style Cheesecake with Brazil Nut Crust  Makes 1 9-inch cake, which can be cut into 12 slices.  Crust:  2 cups raw Brazil nuts  4 Tbsp. unsalted butter  2 tsp. Molasses pinch of cinnamon  pinch of salt  Filling:  2 1/2 lbs. cream cheese, at room temperature  pinch of salt  10 Tbsp. Steviva Blend a tiny dash of Steviva Stevia Powder 1/2 cup sour cream  2 tsp. fresh lemon juice  2 tsp. pure vanilla extract  2 large egg yolks  6 large eggs  Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper and coat the inside of the pan with soft butter.  If you are using raw Brazil nuts, spread them on a baking sheet and roast for 10-15 minutes until they are lightly golden. If using roasted macadamia nuts, omit the roasting. Let cool. While the nuts are toasting, melt the butter. Transfer the nuts to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add the remaining ingredients and pulse to combine. Pat evenly into the bottom of the springform pan. Place in the fridge.  Increase the oven temperature to 500°F. In a food processor or mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the sweeteners, sour cream, lemon juice and vanilla and process or beat until combined. Add the egg yolks and then the eggs, two at a time, beating until incorporated before you add the next two. Remember to scrape the bowl frequently while you are mixing.  Carefully pour the filling over the chilled crust and place the springform on a rimmed baking sheet or larger pan. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 200°F and continue baking for 1 1/2 hours. Do not open the door! The cheesecake should still look soft in the center.  Transfer to a cooling rack. After 5 minutes, run a paring knife around the outside of the cheesecake to loosen it from the pan. Continue cooling to room temperature. You can serve it right away, or chill.

						   Perfect Hard Boiled Eggs  1. Check date on egg carton at store.  Some stores overstock eggs and sell aging eggs until gone.  If you don't use them right away they are impossible to peel.  2. Place eggs in large pot and completely cover with water.  If they float, they are passed their prime.  3. Put a spoonful of vinegar in the water before placing on stove.  3. Place eggs in cold water.  Place pot on stove.  Bring to a hard boil.  Immediately remove from heat: cover; let stand 15 minutes; peel immediately. Hold under cold running water briefly to allow shell & membrane to cool slightly to make manageable. Crack shell on side of sink.  Make sure you have the membrane attached to the shell you are pulling off.

						   CHICKEN AND SAUSAGE JAMBALAYA 2  1 pkg chicken thighs (6 count)  1/2 pkg Hilshire Farms Polish Kielbasa (or other smoked sausage), sliced  1/2 bell pepper, chopped  5 stalks celery, chopped  3 large white onions, chopped (DO NOT use a food processor)  2 cloves garlic, chopped fine  1/4 cup peanut oil  2 cups white rice (regular white rice. NOT Minute rice!!!)  2 1/2 cups water  1 12 oz beer (Budweiser works fine)  flour to coat chicken  1 1/2 tsp Rosemary  1 tsp Thyme  A handful of chopped parsley (hard to put too much)  Salt to taste  Lots of cayenne pepper   Instructions:   Start off by washing the chicken and placing it skin side down on a plate (you can remove the skin if you want). Now, depending on how spicy you want it, coat the chicken with Cayenne pepper until very red (I use a LOT of Cayenne in mine). Don't worry about getting it too hot, since this is the majority of the pepper you are going to add and it will cook into the rest of the dish. Turn the chicken pieces over and lightly coat the skin side. Let sit for 15 minutes or so to soak it all up.   Heat the oil in the bottom of a large heavy cast iron or aluminum pot (don't use thin aluminum or stainless steel since the rice will tend to stick and burn if you're not really careful). Place the flour in a paper bag (season the flour lightly with salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic powder, etc). Place a couple of pieces of chicken at a time into the bag and shake to coat.   Fry the chicken in the oil until golden brown. Don't worry about cooking it all the way through just yet. Remove the chicken. Now place the onions, celery, garlic and bell pepper into the pot along with a bit more oil if necessary) and saute them until the onions are transparent, scraping the bottom of the pot often. Add the rosemary, thyme and parsley and cook for a minute or so.   Place the sausage slices, chicken, and a little water into the pot and mix well with the vegetables. Turn heat low, cover and simmer for about 30 minutes (until the chicken is tender). Stir the mixture frequently, always scraping the bottom to keep things from burning (break the chicken up a bit with the spatula as it cooks. It should break up naturally as the dish cooks, but this just helps things a little).   When the chicken is cooked, add the washed rice and stir it into everything for a couple of minutes. Pour the warm beer and the water in and stir things for another minute or so. Taste it at this point and adjust the salt if necessary. Now, keeping the heat low, cover the pot and cook until the rice is tender (anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour). Stir the mixture every now and then, scraping the bottom of the pot.

						   TURTLE BROWNIES     BROWNIE LAYER INGREDIENTS:    4 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped    1 ounce unsweetened chocolate, chopped    1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, cut into pieces    1 cup packed brown sugar    1 teaspoon vanilla    2 large eggs    3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour    1/4 teaspoon baking powder    1/2 teaspoon salt     CARAMEL-PECAN LAYER INGREDIENTS:    3/4 cup granulated sugar    1/3 cup light corn syrup    3 tablespoons water    1/3 cup heavy cream    1 teaspoon vanilla    1 1/2 cups pecans (6 ounces)     * 1 ounce semisweet chocolate for garnish (optinal)     DIRECTIONS:    Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Add butter and flour a 9-inch    square baking pan, tap off and discard the excess flour.     Make brownie layer:    In a heavy 1 1/2-quart saucepan melt chocolate and butter    over low heat, stirring, until smooth and remove pan from    heat. Cool mixture to lukewarm and stir in brown sugar and    vanilla. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well with a wooden    spoon until mixture is glossy and smooth. In a bowl sift    together flour, baking powder, and salt and add to    chocolate mixture, beating just until batter is combined    well. Spread batter evenly in pan and bake in middle of    oven 30 to 35 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean.    Cool brownie layer completely in pan on a rack.     Make caramel-pecan layer:    In a heavy 3-quart saucepan bring sugar, corn syrup, water,    and a pinch salt to a boil over moderate heat, stirring    until sugar is dissolved, and boil mixture, without    stirring, until it turns a golden caramel. Remove pan    from heat and carefully add cream and vanilla (mixture    will bubble up and steam). Stir in pecans and quickly pour    mixture over brownie layer, spreading evenly. Cool brownies    completely in pan on a rack.     For Garnish:    In a double boiler or metal bowl set over a saucepan of    barely simmering water melt chocolate, stirring, until    smooth and remove top of double boiler or bowl from heat.    Transfer chocolate to a small sealable plastic bag.    Squeeze chocolate into one corner of bag and with a sharp    knife cut a tiny slice off corner to form a small hole.    Squeeze chocolate decoratively over brownies.     Chill brownies, loosely covered, until caramel is firm, at    least 4 hours. Cut chilled brownies into 16 squares and    remove from pan while still cold. Let brownies come to    room temperature before eating. Brownies keep, covered    and chilled in one layer, 5 days.

						   All Day Long Crockpot Beef  Recipe By     : Faye Website       : http://www.crockerykitchen.com Serves/Makes  : 6 Categories    : Beef Entrees     1 1/2 lb Beef roast     1/2 ts Black pepper       2    Garlic cloves; minced     1/2 pk Onion soup mix       2 ts Worcestershire sauce       1 ts Steak sauce       3    Carrots; sliced       2    Celery stalks; diced       1    Green bell pepper; chopped       1    Yellow onion     1/2 c  Water     1/2 c  Tomato juice     1. Cut beef roast into serving-sized portions. Use more beef if   you need more than 6 servings. Brown beef in a bit of vegetable oil,   although you can skip this step if rushed for time.      2. Slice onion and separate into rings. Dice the peeled carrots,   dice the celery and slice the peppers into thin strips or circles.   Place these into bottom of crockpot. Sprinkle the beef pieces with   fresh ground black pepper, minced garlic and the onion soup mix.   Place on top of the vegetables.      3. Mix the steak sauce and Worcestershire sauce in a small bowl   with about 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup tomato juice. Pour this over the   meat.      4. Turn the crockpot to high for 30 minutes, or, if you're in a   hurry, skip this step. Turn to low, cover and cook for 7-9 hours.      Keep the crockpot covered as much as possible throughout cooking   time. A crockpot can be used to cook this type of meal for a varied   amount of time, depending on your schedule. It is not important that   you take the meat and vegetables out at a specific amount of time.   One or two hours either way usually makes no difference.      When ready to serve, dip meat and vegetables out of pot with a   slotted spoon. Use the liquid as is or turn crockpot to high and   thicken liquid with a little flour or cornstarch.

Bake until the souffles have risen  and are golden brown on top, about 20 to 25 minutes (but do not open  the door during the baking time). Remove from the oven and serve  immediately.  Emeril's Essence:  2 1/2 tablespoons paprika  2 tablespoons salt  2 tablespoons garlic powder  1 tablespoon black pepper  1 tablespoon onion powder  1 tablespoon cayenne pepper  1 tablespoon dried leaf oregano  1 tablespoon dried thyme  Combine all ingredients thoroughly and store in an airtight jar or  container.

						   Pineapple Ice Topped with Meringue  Yield: 10 to 12 servings  Pineapple Ice:  1 (3 1/2-pound pineapple)  1/4 to 1/3 cup granulated sugar  1/4 to 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice  Meringue:  3 egg whites at room temperature  Pinch salt  Pinch cream of tartar  3/4 cup granulated sugar, ground to a powder in the food processor or  blender  To make the pineapple ice: Halve the pineapple lengthwise. With a  grapefruit knife (or other small sharp knife), cut around the inside  edges and remove the pulp, leaving 1/4-inch-thick shells. Pat the  shells dry and freeze them, covered with plastic wrap. Core the  pineapple pulp and cut it into 1-inch pieces. In the food processor  or in a blender puree the pulp until smooth, blend in the granulated  sugar and lemon juice to taste, and transfer the mixture to the ice- cube trays. Freeze the ice in the freezing compartment of the  refrigerator until frozen, transfer the cubes to the food processor,  and blend them until the ice is light and fluffy. Pack the ice into  the pineapple shells, mounding it slightly, and freeze the shells,  covered with plastic wrap, in the freezing compartment of the  refrigerator until the ice is frozen. Preheat the broiler.  In a bowl with the mixer beat the whites with the salt until foamy,  add the cream of tartar, and beat the whites until they hold soft  peaks. Add the pulverized granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time,  and beat the meringue until it holds stiff peaks.   Transfer the meringue to the pastry bag (fitted with a small star  tip) and pipe it decoratively over the ice, covering the ice  completely. Sift the confectioners' sugar over the meringue, arrange  the shells on a baking sheet, and put them under the broiler about 6  inches from the heat for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until the  meringue is browned lightly. Serve the desserts immediately.

						   Smoked Salmon Ravioli with Sour Cream and Dill  Yield: 4 servings  1/3 cup finely chopped shallot  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1/2 cup finely chopped smoked salmon (about 1/4 pound)  1/4 cup cream cheese at room temperature  2 tablespoons minced fresh dill  3 tablespoons minced fresh chives  2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  Salt and pepper  24 won ton wrappers, thawed if frozen  Water or egg wash  Melted unsalted butter, for sauce  Sour cream, for garnish  Minced fresh dill, for garnish  In a small heavy skillet cook the shallot in the butter over  moderately low heat, stirring, until it is soft, transfer the mixture  to a bowl, and let it cool. Stir in the salmon, cream cheese, dill,  chives, lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste, stirring until the  filling is combined well and chill the filling, covered, for 1 hour,  or until it is cold.   Put 1 won ton wrapper on a lightly floured surface, mound 1  tablespoon of the filling in the center of the wrapper, and brush the  edges well with water or egg wash. Put another won ton on top and  press to seal around the edges. Trim the excess dough around the  filling with a decorative cutter or sharp knife. Make won ton ravioli  with the remaining wrappers and filling in the same manner,  transferring them as they are formed to a dry kitchen towel, and turn  them occasionally to let them dry slightly.   Bring a kettle of boiling salted water to a gentle boil and in it  cook the ravioli in batches for 2 minutes, or until they rise to the  surface and are tender. (Do not let the water boil vigorously once  the ravioli have been added.) Transfer the ravioli as they are cooked  with a slotted spoon to a dry kitchen towel or paper towels to drain  and keep them warm. Arrange 3 of them on each of 4 heated plates.  Drizzle the ravioli with the melted butter and serve them with the  sour cream and the dill.

						   Campari and Passionfruit Sorbet  Yield: 4 servings  1 cup water  7 ounces sugar  15 passion fruits  1 wine glass (5 ounces) Campari  Place the water and sugar in a pan, bring to the boil and simmer for  5 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool for a while. Halve  the passion fruits and scoop out the flesh, seeds and juice using a  spoon. Stir this up--you can pass it through a sieve to remove the  seeds, but quite frankly I think that's palaver (nonsense). I like  the seeds. Mix the passion fruit with the Campari and sugar syrup in  a plastic tub or earthenware dish and place in the freezer.  Generally, sorbet takes 2 hours to set. Try to stir it around every  1/2 hour if you remember. Serve on its own, with some seasonal fruit,  or in a cone with some vanilla ice cream.

						   Rosemary Barbecued Salmon Fillets Makes: 6 servings 1/2 cup KRAFT CATALINA Dressing   1/4 cup orange juice   2 fresh rosemary sprigs   2 cloves garlic, minced   6 salmon fillets (4 oz. each)     MIX dressing, orange juice, rosemary and garlic.

						   Grilled Pork Loin with Pineapple Salsa Makes: 10 servings 1/2 of a medium fresh pineapple, finely chopped   1 medium red pepper, finely chopped   1/4 cup chopped cilantro   1/4 cup KRAFT Italian Dressing   2 envelopes SHAKE 'N BAKE Original Pork Seasoned Coating Mix   1 Tbsp. ground cumin   1 Tbsp. garlic powder   1-1/2 tsp. ground allspice   2 Tbsp. lime juice   1 boneless center-cut pork loin roast (3 lb.)     PREHEAT grill to high heat. Mix pineapple, red pepper, cilantro and  dressing until well blended. Cover and refrigerate until ready to  serve.   COMBINE coating mix and seasonings in large plastic bag. Brush lime  juice evenly onto meat. Place meat in bag with coating mixture; close  bag and shake until meat is evenly coated. Remove meat from bag;  place in disposable roasting pan, or on large piece of foil that has  been poked in several places with holes. Press any remaining coating  mixture onto meat.   TURN off one of the grill burners, then place meat on that side.  Close lid of grill. Cook 1 to 1-1/4 hours or until meat is cooked  through. (Pork is done when meat thermometer inserted into thickest  part of meat registers 160°F.) Serve with the pineapple mixture.     Cooking Know-How: Cooking the meat in the preheated grill over the  side without the burner on uses the indirect heat method. This  ensures tender meat without burning the coating.  Note: Don't have a plastic bag large enough to coat the pork roast?  No problem. Just cover a large baking sheet with wax paper, then  sprinkle with coating mix. Add the meat and roll in coating mix until  evenly coated.

      I may never follow another recipe again.    Last night it was time to start dinner and the cupboards where looking bare.  I wasnt going shopping but needed something warm and filling for the house to eat so I started scrounging.  I grabbed some chicken out of the freezer. Looking around I found some potatoes that were at the use them or lose them stage so I pealed and cubed them and set them to boil in the pot with the cut up chicken.  Added some chx bullion and forgot about it for an hour.  After digging a bit more I realized green veggies of any kind were not to be found but I did find some chx gravy mix.  I mixed the gravy mix into the pot, used the last of the bisquick for drop biscuits and wala!  They were raving about this dinner!!    I dont get it......LOL  They all but licked the pot, not a scrap left over.  Amazing

Working things through in my head, making sure that I know where im coming from and what I expect both of Bryan and myself.   He gets so bullheaded sometimes. Wont listen to what anyone else has to say. Repeats the same things over and over and over again.  It can be irritating, but I have to hand him this.  He’s getting what he wants!

      Develop a Sense of Urgency by: Brian Tracy  Perhaps the most outwardly identifiable quality of a high performing man or woman is "action orientation".   Take Time To Think and Plan Highly productive people take the time to think, plan and set priorities. They then launch quickly and strongly toward their goals and objectives. They work steadily, smoothly and continuously and seem to go through enormous amounts of work in the same time period that the average person spends socializing, wasting time and working on low value activities.  Getting Into “Flow” When you work on high value tasks at a high and continuous level of activity, you can actually enter into an amazing mental state called "flow." Almost everyone has experienced this at some time. Really successful people are those who get themselves into this state far more often than the average.  In the state of "flow," which is the highest human state of performance and productivity, something almost miraculous happens to your mind and emotions.  Double Your Productivity You feel elated and clear. Everything you do seems effortless and accurate. You feel happy and energized. You experience a tremendous sense of calm and personal effectiveness.  Become More Alert and Aware In the state of "flow," identified and talked about over the centuries, you actually function on a higher plane of clarity, creativity and competence. You are more sensitive and aware. Your insight and intuition functions with incredible precision. You see the interconnectedness of people and circumstances around you. You often come up with brilliant ideas and insights that enable you to move ahead even more rapidly.  Develop A Sense of Urgency One of the ways you can trigger this state of flow is by developing a "sense of urgency.” This is an inner drive and desire to get on with the job quickly and get it done fast. This inner drive is an impatience that motivates you to get going and to keep going. A sense of urgency feels very much like racing against yourself.   Create A “Bias For Action” With this ingrained sense of urgency, you develop a "bias for action." You take action rather than talking continually about what you are going to do. You focus on specific steps you can take immediately. You concentrate on the things you can do right now to get the results you want and achieve the goals you desire.  Action Exercises First, select one major task confronting you and launch into it immediately. Don’t hesitate. Move fast.

      Yeah yeah, so I havent posted lately.  I had surgery folks!!  Actually Im feeling better than I thought I would.  But my mind pretty much shuts down when events like that take place.   Today I am determined to be productive to some extent.  Yesterday I spent some time  urlLink knitting , watching a movie and sleeping.  Nothing big there!  Today I have a list to tackle.  We'll see how much gets done.  One more cancer stick and i'll get started.  I want to clear some room in the dinning room, photograph about 100 auctions and then get busy loading them into turbo lister.  Gotta make some money to make up for this time off from work.  Its supposed to rain for the rest of the week, I am not looking forward to the humidity.   Well, i'll check in later if something interesting happens

      I am beginning my two week hiatus from work by creating a recipe blog.  I collect tons of recipes and this seems like as good a place as any to save and share them.

      Today I feel like I've lost that fuzz in my brain finally.  It was a long weekend in terms that I was in a workshop for 8 hours each day.  Felt like I didnt have any time off of work. Yesterday, Monday, I felt like I was walking around with a serious fuzzy brain.    Lots to do today!  Its too bad that my job is one of the items on the list.  B has informed me that I have a July 29th move date and to start planning for it.  Its kinda hard to plan for when you're not 100% positive that you'll have a job on the other end to make that blasted car payment. But, I believe that I am going to act as if I do, work towards our real estate goals, my ebay goals and make it happen. Prepare for it to happen on that date so that when (note I didnt say if) it happens I am ready to go.  Time to make the donuts!

      I made it!  It's Friday!    I would love to say that I am doing something amazing this weekend but I am not.....lol  I am spending 8 hours each day in a class regarding federal and state grants and loans.  My exciting life, I know. Bryan signed up for this program and I am the brains of the opperation so I have to go also.    Good news!  I get to spend the weekend with Bryan without driving up north!!  Actually, its cool.  I get to see his family, including the recently returned brother from Iraq.  Im glad he's home.  There is one more brother in Afghanistan still :-(    I suppose thats the problem with having 8 boys in one family.  Well, one of the problems

      Wednesday has begun..... we're almost to the end     The worst part of going up north for me is the part where I have to come back down state.  I am always in a blah mood for the next few days.  (So blah that I am seriously considering employment at the taco bell up there that is hiring.....lol)  Good news,  I talked to the anesthesiologist yesterday.  Yanno, I cannot take any vitamins until my surgery date.  Weird, but im sure there is a reason.  My boss heard me talking to her and discussing my noni juice (liquid suppliment that I swear by) and he thought I was pitching it to someone...lol  Gotta love a job where you can rocket launch nerf balls at the boss because he is interupting you on a phone call.  Wish I could transfer the boss and the job up north but......  Ive got a late start today because I dont have to be downtown for a meeting until 9am.  You'd think I'd sleep in a bit but noooooooo.  My loving, watchful cat knows when my alarm goes off and when I dont get up he thinks its his job to make sure I am not late      Well, I believe that I am awake enough to start moving

      June 1, 2004   It's official.  We are half way through this year.  As I sit here putting my thoughts to cyber space I have a renewed sense of purpose and a feeling of utter exhaustion.  How can I have both?    I stopped by the bank today and had my Customer agreement notarized so it will go out in tomorrows mail.  I have a handful of auctions to package up so that they can go out also and of course, laundry to do so I don't have to go to work naked tomorrow    It is 6:15pm and in 45 minutes I am expected at the local coffee shop for a knitting meet-up that I am truly too tired to attend but have committed to.       I have committed myself to accomplishing at least one thing each day that does not include my 9-5 job.  I have noticed a trend toward not doing anything when I get home from work.  Tasks pile up and I feel overwhelmed as time goes on.    With all of my up coming plans for the future months of this year it is time for me to "Just Do It" and today is day 1.    So off I go to "Just Do It" for today   Brightest blessings   I wrote this on December 31, 2003 as is my tradition.    2004 New Beginnings   As I look back over the closing year I am amazed at what it has contained. The obstacles, the hurdles and the achievements. I began the year with the task of reinventing myself at work. Mirroring the new company I was working for. Rising to challenges, facing weaknesses in myself and learning how to deal with my perceived weaknesses in others. A majority of this year was focused on my career with a constant thought of where I want to be in my life, in my career and in my zip code.   For over a decade I have wanted to live in northern Michigan. It has been an ever present, though evasive goal. A large roadblock to the door of that dream was fear. Allowing the “what if’s” to hold me back. Not until near the end of the year did it occur to me that to make this dream come true I would need to let go of my fears and once again reinvent myself. Reinvent myself? Oh bother! I finally got pretty good at this persona. Why do I have to reinvent myself again? Because as the saying goes, “if you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always gotten”   For 15 years I was in the restaurant business. Waitressing and bartending. Serving the public at large. Then change occurred. Unwanted undesirable change that forced my hand and led me in a different path. Hence my introduction to corporate America. I finally got a “real job” as my mother often requested me to do. 40+ hours a week, a steady paycheck, health insurance and a respectable job title according to some. Don’t get me wrong, I loved waitressing for a living more than I’ve loved any job I’ve held to date. But after so much time there was no thought process to it, I was running on automatic. When I put down my apron and picked up my keyboard the challenges rolled in. I had to reinvent the way that I thought, the way that I presented myself and the way that I communicated. I quickly picked up words like circumvent, process mapping and unacceptable. I thrived on the day to day challenges and opened doors to opportunities that I had no idea existed. In 4 years I reinvented myself 4 times to enable me to meet the expectations of myself and those who influenced my career. I lived and breathed my work 5 days, 50-60 hours a week. Until that life altering day when they told me that I needed to see a cardiologist. Then I slowed it down, concentrated on removing the stress in my life and reinvented myself again.   My best friend told me not long ago that I was great at reinventing myself. That I did it with each and every relationship that I got into. That set off bells with me. Each relationship that I entered into in one way or another was impacted due to how I changed myself. After each relationship I strived to recreate myself allowing for the changes necessary. I lived, I loved and I learned. But most of all, I changed. I changed how I presented myself and how I saw myself. I have told my team for the last year that change is good. It is not something we should fear, but something we should embrace and enjoy. My leap of faith is forcing me to live the words that I speak.   In November of this year I decided that it was time for me to meet the goal that I had set for 2003. It was time to take that leap of faith. It is time to accept the changes needed to meet my dreams, to conquer the fears that creep into my thoughts and to reinvent myself to meet my new challenges and my new lifestyle.   I am truly blessed with a family that worries about me, friends that support me and a new found confidence in myself. These blessings will carry me into the next phase of my life. A new beginning. I may have regrets; I may have failures, however I am positive that I will also have many successes on this journey. I know this because I have learned that once I make up my mind to do something, to meet a goal, to achieve a position or to conquer a fear that I can see myself doing it and then it becomes reality. I can see my life as clear as any picture. I know what I want and am willing to pay the prices necessary to make it reality.   A man I know one described Michiganders as “do’ers” Winter, Spring, Summer or Fall there is so much to do in this state that a true Michigander is a “do‘er“. I decided in that instant that I wanted to be a “do’er” That I wanted to move away from my comfort zone and make the changes necessary to become one who does things.   January 2004 will see many changes. Doors will open and doors will close. In either case there is movement. In order for success there must be movement, there must be change and there must be a beginning. This is my year of New Beginnings. Of reinventing myself once again. Of making the necessary changes to bring my dreams to reality, of becoming a “do’er”.   As I say good-bye to this year I am thankful for my family and my friends. I look forward to walking through new doors and closing old ones. Once again i will continue to find the magick in each day and laughter when ever possible. As the clock strikes midnight on New Years Eve I take the steps leading me to New Beginnings.

      This was / is my week for completing stuff to get ready to move this weekend.&nbsp; Think things could go smoothly?&nbsp; Oooooooooh no.   Ive been busy busy with work, completing employee mid-year reviews, learning some of my new responsibilities and over all just getting through the week.&nbsp; Wednesday I get a call from my sister telling me to get to my mothers house because Jack (her 90lb dog) collapsed at the bottom of the basement stairs and mom needs help.&nbsp;  I leave work, rushed home to help get him to the vet. Luckily one of my moms friends showed up too and we managed to get him in.&nbsp; The vet thought&nbsp;he had a stroke and most likely, later that afternoon we would have to have Jack put to sleep.&nbsp; Damn dog has a heart the size of texas and is a great big 90lb mushball.&nbsp; Breaks my&nbsp; heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its been one of those months, seems death is making its rounds.&nbsp; GOOD NEWS.&nbsp; It seems this was a seizure, he's on meds now, up and moving again and back home.&nbsp;   B. is bringing the trailer down state so that we can load it up with the remaining items and all of the clothing i have coming in.&nbsp; I was contacted earlier this week and it will&nbsp;( of course) be arriving tomorrow!&nbsp; So, work&nbsp;8 hours, come home, move everthing onto the trailer, hook it&nbsp;back up to the truck so&nbsp;B. can move it to his brothers house for the weekend and meet me at home on Tuesday.  On top of all of this chaos, I was asked today if I would be willing to be interviewed regarding selling on eBay by a reporter for the Philadelphia Enquirer.&nbsp; Uhhh yeah, like i'd turn down that opportunity!!&nbsp; So hopefully we'll get that out of the way tomorrow...lol&nbsp;   When it rains it pours and I need a bucket!!  Life is good!&nbsp;

      July has been a busy month for me.&nbsp; A lot of changes.&nbsp; Good, bad and unexpected.&nbsp;   My friend Maggie's dear husband passed away.&nbsp; A dear sweet man who was her whole life.&nbsp; That event made me take stock and consider where I was, what I was doing and what I really wanted to do.&nbsp;   I decided to complete my move to Oscoda and called a meeting with my boss to resign.&nbsp; I fully expected to take a major pay cut when I moved but now that wont be necessary.&nbsp; They did not accept my resignation and I will be working remotely from Oscoda!&nbsp; This is the biggest compliment that I have ever received from an employer.   So, in one week I pack the remainder of my belongings and my cats and make the final transition to Oscoda with one major worry put aside.&nbsp;   In addition to that, my first shipment of clothing is expected any day now and that will be moving with me.&nbsp; I will probably be glued to the computer for the first month I am up there.&nbsp; Work all day and work all night with ebay.&nbsp; I am excited!!&nbsp; This clothing line could secure my finances and provide an alternative source of income.&nbsp; It will take me about 4 months to get it fully operational and steady so having my job transfer with me was a real blessing from the goddess.&nbsp; It has kept me out of taco bell for an income.....lol  I am going to begin a fitness regimine when I get up there.&nbsp; I'd like to come back down in a month for my business meeting having lost a few lbs and looking stress free.&nbsp; In addition I am just gaining too much weight lately.&nbsp; With all the stress I have been shoveling food into my face and im feeling the reprecusions.&nbsp; I DONT LIKE IT.  Aside from all that I am still knitting and looking forward to completing some gifts for the holidays.&nbsp; This week is going to be the busiest of all so I will probably not post anything, but will make a point of posting regular once the move is completed.  &nbsp;

      I have also been working on a wool scarf for my cousin Bob. Its going to be nice once its completed and blocked.  I should have garter stitched an inch on the bottom to keep it from curling. :-(  I did garter stitch the sides.  5 stitches each side.  I think I like this... may have to make one for myself     This picture is more its true color.  The flash made the picture above too light in color.

      Well, I am still working on both of these.  It seems to be slow going. I get frustrated when I have to sit around and that frustration keeps me from being productive with my sit around work.  Its driving me crazy!!!  Today I am going to finish Laurie's scarf!!!  The mobeous scarf is just going to take longer, nothing I can do about it.

      I took Lauries scarf with me last weekend only to have it systmatically dismanteled by the family dog.  So, I frogged the whole thing and started over.  I am going to change needle sizes too.  Time to downsize, I didnt really like the large needles so I am going to pop down to size 9.  With the next two weeks off I should be able to get quite a bit of knitting completed. I am looking forward to it.  That and catching up on 5 years of sleep!  Now for the Mobeous (spell check needed) scarf I am using denim yarn, 2 sk, size 9 needles.  Garter stitch the whole thing.  Lay it flat, then twist one end wrong side to right and seam together. I love this yarn!  Its so soft I just know i'll be wearing this scarf all winter long!  Pictures coming soon!  (well as soon as I can figure out how to do it......lol)

      I was given a heads up on a GREAT garage sale yesterday so I sped over there during my lunch hour.  Walked out with a sewing box filled to the brim of hand looms, knitting accessories, crochet needles and more.  Along with a ton of patters and about 60 old Workbasket magazines from the 40's and 50's.  I LOVE treasure hunts!  I am in class all weekend but will have evenings to work on Laurie's scarf.  Hopefully I can get it finished this weekend :-)

      I started Laurie's scarf at a knitting meet-up last night.  Turns out there were two knitting groups in the same location.  Nice to meet new folks :-)  This should be an easy scarf to crank out real quick.  I'll be working on it more tonight after I finish up my "must do's"  I want it finished quickly so that I can do another co-workers scarf that she wants to give to her friend.  Do you see a trend here?

      Im starting a project for a co-worker tonight.  Laurie wants a fun fur scarf for her sister.  I like working with the fun fur so this should be easy enough    Of course, when I was picking up her yarn I could not resist the Chocolate Brown fun fur for myself.  Oooooooooh so pretty!  That is further down the list of things to do though.    This is going to be an easy scarf.  2 skeins of Tropical Fun Fur.  Garter stitch the entire thing. 20 stitches in length with size 13 needles.  Ooooooh la la

      Finished a ladder yarn scaf!&nbsp;   15 stitches wide, size 13 needles,  This puppy is LOOOOOOOOOOOONG, especially with the fringe on it.&nbsp; Upcoming fringe pic (after the move)&nbsp; Below are two pictures of what it looks like pre-fringe.&nbsp; it is 88" long without the fringe,&nbsp; 107" long including the fringe.&nbsp;        I also completed a scarf using champaign eyelash yarn with a champaign colored TLC yarn using size 35 needles. It was an experiment, but I must admit (patting myself on the back) I love the way it turned out.&nbsp; Photo's coming I promise.   I have managed to finish all of the request knitting from work and now can focus on me and mine and some charity knitting.&nbsp;   Move is in 2 days!!!!!
