      In my dream the artist is an older man. He is brown from the sun and solid. He has the typical etched lines in his face and a shock of fuzzy white hair symbolic of relaxed wisdom and gentle age. This person holds weight; this person has left marks.  He sees something in me that I don't see. A seed. A spark. Talent. Potential. Call it what you will. I am a pale little girl thing. I am not wise. I drift and bounce; I leave no impression. He wants to cultivate my potential as one cultivates a plant. He rains down supplies and instruction upon me. A shower of ink and paper and brushes and pens and paint and "Look inside yourself" and "Stay open".  He is excited. He thinks something beautiful is going to blossom. I feel bad because he is wrong, but I don't know how to tell this wise man that he has made a mistake. I am not the person he thinks I am. There is no spark here. I am pale. I am nothing. I am empty.  In my dream.  He insists. Who am I to argue?

      It is just after midnight and I just found out some of what has been going on the world today.  First headline:  California Annuls Gay Marriages   According to BBC World, "California's Supreme Court has annulled about 4,000 gay marriages that took place in San Francisco. The court ruled that San Francisco's mayor [Gavin Newsome] had overstepped his authority by issuing same-sex marriage licences earlier this year. Thousands of same-sex couples were married in the city between 12 February and 11 March, when the court issued an injunction halting the wedding spree. "  Second headline:  US governor quits over gay affair     Again according to BBC World, "The governor of the US state of New Jersey has announced his resignation, admitting that he had an extramarital affair with a man. 'My truth is that I am a gay American,' Democrat James McGreevey, 47, told a packed news conference. "  I didn't originally pick this information up from a BBC headline. I flipped on the TV. Honestly, I intended to turn on a rerun of  The X-Files  and fall asleep. The show wasn't on, so I started flipping and came across CNN Headline News showing a brief clip from McGreevey's speech that I then saw repeated (within the next five minutes) on each of the 24 hour cable news channels that I get (in addition to Headline News there are CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. The clipped text? "I am also here today because, shamefully, I engaged in adult consensual affair with another man, which violates my bonds of matrimony. It was wrong. It was foolish. It was inexcusable. And for this, I ask the forgiveness and the grace of my wife. "  My first thoughts? Okay, so, you're gay and you cheated on you wife. Cheating. Definitely wrong. Not really an indicator of strong character, but not exactly unusual. Homosexuality. Nothing wrong with that, also not exactly unusual, although not likely to help a political career. But you are already the legally elected governor of the state of New Jersey.  What the hell does the turmoil in your bedroom have to do with your fitness and ability to govern?   It only took about ten minutes of digging to get a larger picture. Salon has the  urlLink full text  of McGreevey's speech along with other pertinent information including mention of McGreevey's steadily declining approval ratings in the wake of criminal charges against two of his fundraisers and an expected sexual harassment lawsuit (yes, the suit is being brought by a man). MSNBC's Countdown, to their credit, also made note of these things. In his speech McGreevey never expressly stated why he is resigning. He did say, "It makes little difference that as governor I am gay. In fact, having the ability to truthfully set forth my identity might have enabled me to be more forthright in fulfilling and discharging my constitutional obligations." Personally, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. Governor, you implied that you were somehow remiss in "fulfilling and discharging" your constitutional obligations. Could you tell us exactly how?  The thing that is really bothering me with the McGreevey story is the hook. What was that BBC headline again? Oh yes,  US governor quits over gay affair . That has to be one of the most sensational serious news headlines I've heard in years. Governor McGreevey didn't resign over a gay affair. With only the information given in the speech (it should be noted that the entirety of his comments must be reviewed) I don't think I really know why he is  resigning . I buy that the admissions of homosexuality and an extramarital affair are preemptive. But a resignation?  Let's recap. Looking through the glass half empty, gay Americans took two big hits today. See above.  Looking through the glass half full, gay Americans were handed two opportunities today. The California Supreme Court annulled marriages of questionable legal validity (not that I think the law is right), but, as I understand it, the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the law that made those marriages legally questionable. The court only ruled that Gavin Newsome, mayor of San Francisco, over stepped his bounds because the same sex marriage ban is in place in California.  As for Governor McGreevey, "The executive director of the National Stonewall Democrats said that McGreevey's announcement 'gives us further resolve to work towards the point where sexual orientation is simply an honest component of daily life and no longer a consideration in public service.'"  And finally,  the   reason this matters so much to me:  Okay. These things would matter to me regardless, but they are timely.  I have spent the past three days drafting a coming out letter to my family. Fittingly enough, my family is from New Jersey and most of them (including my homophobic brother who's reaction I am most worried about) still live there. One of my biggest fears in terms of coming out to my family is that they won't take it seriously. I am the baby, the youngest grandchild, and I grew up far away (geographically and chronologically) from my cousins and my brother. I'm afraid that they will think that being gay is something that I decided to do in order to be difficult or rebellious. Who in their right mind would really choose to be gay? The truth is passing for straight is something I decided to do in order to avoid bringing challenges or complications into my family life. But passing is a lie. Sometimes it is a lie that is necessary for survival, but it is a lie all the same. Lying beats down soul and being. I've always felt guilty for disrespecting my relatives by lying to them, but I assuaged my guilt by telling myself I was protecting them. What the hell could I be protecting them from? There is nothing wrong with me. And there it is, finally, simply. I really do not know where it came from or how long I'm going to be able to hold on to it, but somehow I've built up just enough self respect to make (and believe) this simple statement. I am gay and there is nothing wrong with me.

      I have a voice. I just don't use it. I have opinions. They scare the hell out of me.  I got caught saying it aloud last week. "I don't care if I win, I just want to be right." There was only one right answer and I had it. I knew I it. So I went after it. I insisted. I demanded. I screamed out. I made a nuisance of myself. And as a bonus, I won.  Usually there is no right answer. I am afraid. I stay silent. I shut down. I disappear. And I lose.
