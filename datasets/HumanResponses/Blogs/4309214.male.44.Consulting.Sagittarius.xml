      Well London was fun, Suzanne and the Kid's spent enough to keep the UK economy going for the rest of the year and may result in yet another interest rate rise by the Bank of England (maybe a whole .5% instead of the usual .25%).  Myself personally I went truly loco and brought some aspirin total cost Â£1.29 :-)  I had one of those days when I could have brought stuff but just couldn't find anything that I really wanted to buy but it was fun watching them spend, especially as it wasn't my money :-)

      It's raining, I must be on holiday :-)  Everyone here is fighting for the bathroom, except Jack he is still in bed.  The plan is off to London today for a shopping trip. Me thinks that the first purchase will be a rain coat or an umbrella, then we can shop for real.    Not sure if I should take the camera or not, if I do any we get anything of any worth I will post it later this evening.  Better go, my slot in the bathroom has arrived and if I take to long Hannah will jump in and that will be at least an hour (on a good day that is).

      So what exciting things have I done on the first day of my holiday?  Lots, well not really we went to the garden centre and brought some plants for the garden then it started to rain so hard we couldn't put them in, cool I think not.  Still we have the rest of the week and they have lived in pots for ages so two or three more days won't hurt them.  The plan is for London tomorrow shopping, stay tuned for more events of extreme excitement

       urlLink Coxbox  It's the first day of my week off and I think that my site needs a rework, especially the photo area. There needs to be title etc.  I would have preferred to have been out and about but in traditional English fashoin it's raining, well it is summer :-)

       urlLink The Life and Times of Coxy I was working late at the office on the Sunday Support Rota, nothing ever happens and all the worked I need to get done was out of the way and I noticed this strange 'B' on the Google toolbar, so I pressed it and you are reading what someone does when bored to the point that brain cells start to scream 'Yaaahhhhhh' like they do.  Ignore the time that this will be labelled with as Uk time is just after 9pm and I guess the time is calculated US (found out how to put this right, cool).  Been doing a little browsing for things to do in the comming weeks vacation. We have London down for one day, probably Tuesday, the rest of the week in currently a mystery but in trueth I preferr that it makes life more interesting.  I had better sign off and get some more work done and maybe a little more browsing, who knows.  CYA

      Ok, I have had my blog going for about 15 minutes and hated the template I chose.  Changed it but not sure that I like this one either!  Still it's easy to change so let's live with it for a while and see if it grows on me.  You never know the next time I post something it may actually be interesting (me thinks not)

      Ok, So I now have a Blog account and page but what does one Blog.  I have been told that this could be anything, be it serious, sad or amusing but the variety of choice only makes this whole excercise harder.  Still we shall see how this all developes.
