      well today Tegan came back, i am so happy! she is tired, but she was telling me how its like tomorrow in Australia or something. haha...i would be tired for sure. she has been up for like 32 hours straight! wowie! she came over to see me for like a half hour. i was SOO happy to see her. i missed her a ton! so much. i was glad that she was willing to come see me, even though she is like a "walking zombie", as she puts it. haha. i am really excited that she's back! *dances around* she was telling me all about her trip and the plane ride and stuff. omg it sounded awesome. im SO glad that she had a good time! hehe. I MISSED HER!  yes, well, work again this morning. dull, boring, slow, agonizing etc. nothing special. i was so bored that I was spending my time coloring pictures and calling the radio station I was listening to. I almost won tickets to a John Mayer and Maroon5 concert! I was caller 23...you had to be caller 25 to win. grrr, so close.   my grandpa is funny. my favorite quote from him so far is: "little kids are nice when you can pat them on the head and then they go home." LMAO. well said, grandpa, well said. haha...well I think its funny. he picked me up from work today...but he was 20 min. late cause he got lost. haha, its all good. =P   well i feel like im floating on a cloud. and no, not DRUGS, i am just so happy that Tegan is back! AH! im happy. hehe. it sucks that she is leaving again on monday. oh well, i survived a whole 10 days, i can do it for only 6. (um, i just reread this and it sounds kinda dirty...haha, sorry bout that. maybe its just me)  anyways, i am gonna go i guess. nothing else really happened today. just, like, wonderful family time *rolls eyes* actually it wasnt that bad. it was kinda fun. haha..bored games, photo albums...so now im going off into more boring crap. haha, so thats my cue to go ahead and wrap this up before i just blab on for another 3 paragraphs. haha.   k, well, nite! love, peace and chicken grease. *muah*  ~Miranda  ps...ya know? i personally think it would be a good idea to leave a comment. think about it, you could be the VERY first one EVER to leave a comment on my fantastic blog. like, people 10 years from now can look back and see your name as the FIRST comment and be like "hey, that person is my hero." just a thought...but do what u wanna do. =P

      OMG! i am soooo excited. Tegan comes back from Australia tomorrow. i have missed her so much.   well i went to work this morning...same hours as yesterday. the ants were gone!! WOO!! whoever took care of that, i love you. hehe. there was a moth there though, i dont like moths either, but i only saw it once, so i was ok. but yea, work was boring. its the 4th so no one really came. i was so bored that i made my boss a "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" sign...its her birthday today. too bad she is on vacation until thursday. haha, oh well, she'll see it then and appreciate the thought. maybe i'll get a raise. haha...i WISH. oH! i made my first cake today. my first cake EVER. well for TCBY at least. it was the strawberry almond cake. not my fav. but doesnt matter, it turned out damn well, if i do say so myself. hehehe.   so my grandpa is in town...staying till he feels like leaving. i wonder how long that will be. i dunno, im a person who likes to know whats going on...so "playing it by ear" is not my style. oh well i guess. mmhmm, so he's supposed to be here for the 4th of July, which he is, but we are doing absolutely nothing...how...exciting?   oh, more about work...ok, so 3 of our like...7 customers were these little kids. ANNOYING little kids. so first, they order all this stuff and sit down. then this one kid, who we werent really sure if was a boy or girl, came up and was like "Preston had 7 dollars and you only gave him back 2." i was like...um, who is Preston? (cause i know ur family members by name..psh, of course) and she/he is like "the boy in the blue hat." (i glanced over at the boy in the blue hat...check: thats Preston.) and so i went back and checked the register recipt. little Preston there had only given us a 5 dollar bill and he had ordered a parfet, which is $3.53 (i've been working at TCBY for too long...haha). and so, therefore, he only gets like 2 dollars back. so this kid, the he/she, is like "oh, ok then." then later they asked us to change the radio station...then left a minute after we changed it. i dunno, its the little things that piss me off. obvioulsy. i mean....c'mon kids. i guess i respect them for checking their money and stuff, but they were very rude to us, in addition to all the annoying requests. yea, i told you i was a complainer, sorry. that really wasnt a good story. haha, sorry.  today i woke up and found myself running through scenes of Moulin Rouge! Like...Subconsciously. it was weird. i was blowdrying my hair and i was like, wait...why am i quoting 'Spectacular Spectacular'? I'll tell ya, its weird not really having control over what your brain does all the time. Hmm, maybe i have a disease. That would be wonderful.   I cut my leg shaving...it stings. thought i would share. ow.   ummmmmmm, i have nothing really deep to say. nothing interesting to share. nothing spectacular to wow you all with. so i guess i am gonna go. k, well, bye then. take care everyone, and have a great 4th. =)  ~Miranda  ps...did i mention Tegan comes back tomorrow? hehe, well she does. =P

      i dunno if i'm gonna have the diligence to keep up with this thing, but i'll try! for all the fans...mmhmm, the fans. haha. anyways....this blog is just gonna be the daily happenings of my life, inner thoughts...whatever the hell i decide to ramble on about. haha. i wouldn't blame any of you if you just stopped reading it..i mean, i doubt it will be anything spectacular. i must also warn you, i am a complainer. yes, that's right, i admit it: i'm a complainer. i will put in my best effort NOT to complain too much on here.   so i guess that brings us to what i did today...hmm, the answer to that question would be work. yea, maybe i'm turning into a workaholic, i cant decide. (i'm a very undecided person, just if you didn't know...) but yea, work. i worked from 9-3. fuuuun. and NO, people don't get TCBY at 9 in the morning...it takes 2 hours to open the frickin store. i can actually open by 10 (we open at 11) but it's nice to have the time to, ya know, TAKE my time. i also made a great discovery: the stereo at work plays CD's! yes, this isn't one of the biggest discoveries of life, let alone of TCBY, but still. it was exciting because that means i can bring in CDs to play, instead of the crap on the radio. so guess what CD i brought?! MOULIN ROUGE!!! yay! it was awesome...i got to open the store all by myself with Ewan McGregor's sweet voice blasting in the background. needless to say i enjoyed it...until 11 o'clock rolled around that is...  OMG! another happening at work...so i was taking a cake to the back freezer which is right by the door in the back that leads outside. so i was walking past this door and happened to look down at the floor where there was a SWARM of ants crawling around carrying various pieces of crap. so i am deathly afraid of ants...i dunno why, i just am. i hate them. with a passion. EW! ANTS! so i stayed away from the back door the rest of the time...i hope someone takes care of that, cause i sure as hell am NOT.   everyone...im counting down! only one whole day until Tegan comes back...i am SO excited! i am excited beyond words. like, there IS no word to explain how i feel. i cannot wait. cannot cannot cannot.  so, well, i guess that's it for right now. i'm gonna go watch Moulin Rouge i think *obsession* yea yea. well i don't really have much of a life right now so i bet i'll be updating a lot, just cause i have nothing better to do than talk about the life i don't have...that makes sense.   before i go, i have to share: i am watching some MTV thing (yes, i know...shuddup). and there was just a commercial for "warm sensations" trojan condoms....riiiiight. i just wanted to say that, um, aren't you ALREADY supposed to get a warming sensation? hm, maybe i am uneducated...or just UNDEReducated...or something. k, i dunno. bye  ~Miranda
