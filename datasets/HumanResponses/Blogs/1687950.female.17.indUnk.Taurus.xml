           Never seen a blue sky Yeah I can feel it reaching out And moving closer There's something about blue Asked myself what it's all for You know the funny thing about it I couldn't answer No I couldn't answer  Things have turned a deeper shade of blue And images that might be real May be illusion Keep flashing off and on Free Wanna be free Gonna be free And move among the stars You know they really aren't so far Feels so free Gotta know free Please Don't wake me from the dream It's really everything it seemed I'm so free No black and white in the blue  Everything is clearer now Life is just a dream you know That's never ending I'm ascending

         It's too late to cry I love you. The wind still blowing, my heart still aching 	 One side of my eyes see tomorrow, And the other one see yesterday I hope I could sleep in the cradle of your love, again  Cry for me, somebody, with dry eyes  The real folk blues I just want to feel a real sorrow It's not bad a life in the muddy river If life is once  Hopeless hope, and the chance with traps What is right, or wrong It's like a both side of a coin  How long I must live till I release? 	 The real folk blues I just want to feel a real pleasure All that glitters is not gold

        One, two boys by the river  Down by the water  Tellin' riddles in the dark  With fireflies under the moonlight  Carvin' the insides of a tree with a knife  Ever hear the one about the boy's big sister  His best friend come along  He tried to kiss her    The only difference  That I see  Is you are exactly the same  As you used to be    One boy lives in a tower  With bow and arrow  And the artificial heart  With his girl  Maid of dishonor  He loaded the cannon  With a jealous appetite  They say that children now  They come in all ages  And maybe sometimes old men die  With little boy faces    The only difference  That I see  Is you are exactly the same  As you used to be    You always said that you needed some  But you always had more, more than anyone    The only difference  That I see  Is you are exactly the same  As you used to be
