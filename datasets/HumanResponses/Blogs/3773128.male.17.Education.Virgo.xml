         We were suppose to have Maths class this afternoon,but due to the Minggu Kualiti INTEC, our lecturer was busy, so she only drop in for a few minutes. So, again we have the whole afternoon free.        Was in the library just now doing the homework that I didn't touch for a week.     And it so happened that I came across 4 Lat's comic, so I borrowed all of it back. I never thought that a library would have collection of Lat's comic. Hopefully I won't be too indulge in it till I neglect all my homework.     Was trying to memorize the song that Q1 SonSengNim gave us yesterday, but it just didn't seem to sink into my mind. I better find a way to memorize it by next Tuesday or else I might be in deep trouble : (     Wanted to use the computer in the lab, but surprisingly the internet was not working in the campus. So had to come to a cyber cafe...not sure how long I can keep up with this    If JPA doesn't give us our allowance within the next 3 weeks I'll probably starve to death :(

          Today we started our first physics class. As with every first class, we were asked by the teacher to introduce ourselves. Frankly, I don't see the point of having Maths and Physics class during the 3 months that we're here. It's not like we have time to go into the details and even if we do have the time it might not help much since everything will be in Korean next time.      The only reason that I could think of is that they want us to use our right brain as well instead of just our left brain. Maybe they want us to have a more busy life than we already have.     But, actually I like a busy life. I fell the meaning of life only when I'm up and about doing something. Life seem so meaningless when we sit back and do nothing.      So it seems that I SHOULD find a good hobby when I'm in Korea so that I don't waste my life there.      Following Toh Hui's advice, I'm starting to go to room 510 more often ever since the misunderstanding with Poh. It seems that I can get along with them quite well :)      Maybe I'm having the wrong concept that the grass on the other side of the river is greener, but sometimes I just feel that the people in the other programs are friendlier. Maybe I'm not spending enough time with the people in my own programs...      Just got the news that Jian Wei got the offer to go into ATU.      It seem strange to me that I didn't think of appealing ever since I receive the offer. Maybe I was very certain that this is God's plan for me.      I do hope I'm not making a grave mistake...      Asked Hock Siang to go to wai Peng's house this weekend, but he just didn't want to.     Well, maybe it's my nature not to feel ashame or guilty going to people's house and causing inconvenience for them :)      With so much homework in my hand and no companion, it seems that my plan of going to Malacca has to be postponed :(

          Finally!!     My own blog!!   Actually I had the intention of creating a blog since few years back. However, I just did not manage to make myself sit in front of the com and write.   But now I fell that it's a good idea to create one cause I want to be in touch with all my friends whom I miss and it's a way I can update them on what's happening to me.    I just finished my ethics class and I'm VERY glad that it ended an hour earlier. Not that I don't like the teacher or anything, but time just seem to FREEZE everytime there's an ethics class.   This is also my first time using the computer in the computer lab. Well, it's actually not as bad as what I heard, although there's a strange smell emitting from the air-con.      Was going aroud asking some of my friends whether they want to go to Malacca this weekend, but most of them doesn't seem interested with the idea except for Jie Ying.    It seems that I may have to go alone this weekend(if I can find a place to stay and there's not much homework) or go another time when it's more appropriate.

      Went to support our INTEC badminton team in the inter-faculty competition last night. I never knew there's so much fun being on the spot to cheer for a team during a competition. At least now I have a slight idea why so many people are crazy about going to the stadium and watch football matches. Although our team didn't win, they put up a good fight. And the most amazing thing was that some of them didn't know each other very well though they were playing doubles in a team.  As many of my coursemate went to do their passport this morning, there wasn't any classroom lesson. However, Q1 SonSengNim gave another of his speech to us, talking about his experiences when he first came to Malaysia in 1991; telling us that foreign tourist have to pay more when they go to KL Tower, and when he sent a letter to the Tourism board concerning the matter the reply he got was "Because this is Malaysia"; motivating and persuading us to go to the top universities in Korea and informing us that getting a 'D' in those universities is considered quite good......  I'll be going back home tomorrow. Quite excited actually. After all, this return is quite unexpected because my initial plan was to go back once only before I fly off to Korea. Now it seems that I'll be going back home twice.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Sunday night when&nbsp;I was in Max's room,&nbsp; we somehow decided to wake up at 6.00am every morning to do our devotion.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was sleeping in their room that night and I managed to wake up on time yesterday, though I slept less than 5 hours.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But yesterday I had a good rest in the afternoon and slept early at night yet I couldn't wake up in time this morning!!! I can't even remember when did I turned off the alarm on my phone!   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 'm really unsatisfied with myself. I'm out here far from my home, and everyday I rely on God's help to pull me through. Yet I've not been spending as much time in my devotion as I used to. Hopefully this is not the beginning of my fall : (   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the cell group last Friday, they was this&nbsp;speaker who said something about passion.&nbsp;We use the word "passion" ever so often yet do we really know what it means? We hear people saying they're passionate about this and that, yet do they really know what they're saying?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the speaker, referring to "The Passion of the Christ", the word 'passion' here&nbsp;actually means 'suffering'.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, how many of us are actually willing to suffer for something?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What the speaker said really struck me on the head. I'm passionate about God, yet am I not even willing to wake up early to spend time with Him?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I'll try to do better in the future, maybe I'll join (at least once) the early morning prayer meeting&nbsp; in Korea :)

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We watched "Classic" , another Korean movie this afternoon. Still, we wouldn't be able to understand the story without the sub-title. I wonder how long would it take before we can watch a Korean movie without sub-titles.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 of our seniors came back from Korea and we had some time to satisfy more of our curiosity about life as a foreign student in Korea.&nbsp; It seems that our seniors had quite a good time over there.  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learning a new language and culture is fun, if&nbsp;I don't need to depend on it to survive. But still, I think I'll manage to pull through, with God's help of course.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm planning to stay in the hostel during my first year in Korea, a thing which none of our seniors did before (not that they didn't want, but they didn't have&nbsp;no choice). Our seniors only moved into hostel after completing their one and a half years' language course.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, we do not have any info concerning life in Seoul National University's hostel as a freshman.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;My reason for staying in the hostel is: &nbsp;firstly,&nbsp; I'll meet more people from other countries and I'll have more time to socialize with them.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it'll be more convenient to join activities held in the university, since the distance between the hostel and university is nearer.  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lastly, I have the intention of going to Seoul National University to pursue my degree. I want to see how's the life, attitude and character of the students studying in the university first-hand.  &nbsp;&nbsp; However, I'll talk this out with Jang SonSengNim before I make my decision.   &nbsp;

      Imagine visiting Melaka without seeing A Farmosa, is that called visiting Melaka at all?  Well, that was my experience last Saturday when I went to Melaka. However, I did manage to ride on a horse and an elephant ( you can't imagine how much it hurts), watch birds doing magic show, elephants playing music instrument...  More of my&nbsp; trip to Melaka  urlLink here .   The thing I want to highlight here is that although the government has been asking people to travel in Malaysia, it seems that there are still many things the government needs to improve on to ensure that tourist, either local or foreign will enjoy their trip.   I went to Melaka, and being unfamiliar with the place, I went to the information counter at the Melaka Sentral bus station and asked for some brochures on tourist spots in Melaka.  To my 'amazement', the only thing they could provide me with was this small-photocopied-hardly visible-town map of Melaka. And THEY expect me to be able to travel around with just that?!  If the government really wants to promote tourism, the least thing they could do is to provide brochures at all major inter-state bus terminal!  &nbsp;  What's more!  When I was taking the bus for a tour around the city, there was a foreign traveler going up the bus as well. She was holding some documents in her hand&nbsp;and showing it to the bus driver, asking him politely&nbsp;whether the bus will be going to that place.  To my disappointment, the bus driver didn't appear to be paying attention to her. He just shouted, "Naik saja cepat!"  I was so ashamed of my fellow Malaysian that I wished there was a hole for me to hide.  All these while we've been reading about articles saying Malaysians are kind and helpful. I really wonder how many of the articles are actually true.  I always thought that people from smaller town and city will be more friendly, because they don't face so much stress in life. It seems that I've made a wrong judgment.  &nbsp;  It's kind of sad that&nbsp;&nbsp;with the&nbsp;advancement of science and technology, people seems to be getting colder towards one another. They've lost their patience along the path so called civilization.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      We had a birthday party in the lecture hall just now for those who's birthday is in the month of July. The party came as a surprise for all of us, because none of us knew about it. Our lecturers were the ones who planed it.  The party reminds me of all the Birthday Bash I had in my youth group back home. However, during the Birthday Bash we had fun and everyone would be laughing and enjoying themselves.  Yet I could sense that a lot of us had a sad feeling during the party this afternoon.  Maybe it's because of Q1's story: when he came to study in Malaysia, he had to celebrate his birthday alone. None of his friends in Korea remembered his birthday.  I guess it'll be the first time for most of us to celebrate our birthday without our families :(      Tried my hand on tennis. It's actually quite fun.    I figure that since I have to learn a language from the beginning and rely on it to survive, i might as well learn a few more stuff, right from the beginning.

          On Friday, I took the City Liner bus wanting to go down to Asia Jaya and take the LRT to Taman Bahagia. When I told the bus driver that I wanted to go to Asia Jaya, he said that he needs to refill the petrol and so won't be passing through Asia Jaya. However, he said I could follow him down to Section 15 because there will be more buses there. So, I went on the bus and sat behind the driver's seat, so that he can tell me where to get down. However, the bus driver never said a thing and so I sat there like a dummy, knowing that something is really wrong yet don't know what to do. So, I was looking out the window all the time trying to figure where I am. Then suddenly, I saw a LRT train passing by. Trusting that there must be a LRT station near by, I got off the bus at the nearest stop and followed the trail of the LRT railway to its station, only to find that I landed myself in Pasar Seni. So, realizing that I must be somewhere near the centre of the city, I decided to go sightseeing. To my delight, I found out that Petaling Street was just around the corner. So although I got myself lost, it was quite rewarding at the end, as I got myself more familiar with the surrounding area.     I asked Wei Chun and Yi Loon to go out on Saturday. Sadly, Yi Loon said he wasn't feeling well and didn't want to go.     We went to KLCC and had our lunch there. One thing I learned there is that a plate of rice with a piece of fried chicken, some veg and a cup of soya bean can cost up to RM 8+ ( Luckily I wasn't the one who bought it :P ).    As we had absolutely nothing to buy, we wanted to take a tour to the bridge. Unfortunately, the tickets for that day had finish.     After that, we wanted to go to Mid Valley Mega Mall. When I was coming to KLCC from Taman Bahagia, I noticed that the nearest LRT station from Mega Mall is at Abdullah Hukum.     So, we took the LRT there and came out of the station looking for the Putra Line buses. As we could find none, I asked a Malay girl in school uniform how do I go to Mega Mall.     She told us that we should take the LRT back to Bangsar and wait for buses there.     As we didn't want to take another trip on the LRT, we decided to take a cab. Yet, all the cabs passed by without stopping. We were not able to walk to Mega Mall as it was raining quite heavily.    Finally, the girl from whom I asked direction came and asked us whether we want to "tumpang" or not, and we accepted the offer.     When I reached Mega Mall, I messaged Wai Peng asking him how do I get back to SS2. He told me I could take bus 99 back.    At Mega Mall, we met Shyr Jinn ( my secondary school classmate) and his mom and brother.     At 3.30pm I decided to go back. So, I came out through South Court (I saw that there is a bus stop there when I came) and saw a Metro bus 99 and on it was written " Mega Mall-SS2" , so I hop onto it. The bus driver didn't ask where I was going but just asked me to pay RM1.20.    On the bus I suddenly remembered it was someone's birthday that day. So I was trying to find out who's birthday it was, and I got to know that it was Chun Yang's birthday.     Suddenly I realized that the surrounding area seems very familiar. When I look out the window, I saw that Petaling Street was just outside the bus!!    And so I landed myself in Pasar Seni by mistake twice in 2 days time :~(    Again, it was a good experience, getting myself familiar with places and to remind myself always ask the  bus driver which direction it's going....

          Starting to have more homework these few days from our Maths lecturer. This means that I'll need to put more time into my studies than what I had planned.     Well, looking at the bright side, this will stop me from going to the cyber cafe so often and wasting my money there : )      Our Korean lecturers showed us a movie just now, and of course it's in Korean (but we do have the subtitle or else we won't understand the whole story).     I dont know, may be it's because I'm getting old, I seem to be quite nostalgic lately.     I tend to think about how it would be like 6 or 7 years down the road. There will be many people that I might not meet again. People whom we were closed with might not be close to us anymore. Relationships will change. Most of us might not be who we used to be. Everything will change, for the better or for the worse...     Well, I know it's pointless thinking of all this, but I just can help it. Anyway, I might be too busy to think about all these next time, so I should think of it while I still have the opportunity, right? :p

        Today we have a new Ethics teacher. She seems to be better than the previous one, she can talk, make some jokes and keep the class a little a live. But at the same time, she's also more demanding.   When we first heard that we'll have a new teacher, some of my classmates conspired and agreed that if the teacher ask whether we have any assignment, they would all say 'No'.   And that's exactly what they DID. So, the teacher gave us new assignments(actually the same one that our previous teacher gave, just that different groups are doing it now).   So my group (me, Vincent and A Jay) was given the topic: "Comparing Religions,their Beliefs and Practices".

        Went to IKEA last night to get some ideas on bedroom decorations. It might come in useful when I'm settling down in Korea.      Was talking with Wai Nyan this afternoon concerning pirated stuff. It seems that if I were to talk any longer with him on this topic, he might just be able to convince me not to use pirated goods.   I never gave so much thoughts about pirated things before this. It just seem ok to use them. Well, maybe when I'm financially secure I'll go against piracy. But not at the moment.    Seems strange that many people are studying the book of Ecclesiastes. First was during last year's church camp, now SIB KL, then this afternoon Wai Nyan told me his cf(if I'm not mistaken) is doing(or is it did) the same book as well.   It's true that sometimes life just seem so meaningless......at the end of the day all things lead to the grave.......why then do we study so much,why watch movie,why why why??.......ther's war going on, people are dying.....yet I'm here writting my blog....   Maybe we'll know the meaning of life when we see it from above the sun, but currently I'm not able to do so, yet.   So, all I can do is trust in HIM to lead me....    Was talking to my friends just now. Seems that I have a lot to catch up in my studies. I've not been working so hard since the orientation.   Will try to come up with a timetable so that my time can be more organized. Better get the stone rolling and catch up on momentum....

        Was chatting with Johnathan on Wednesday night about friendship best friends.    I was asking him did he ever thought of what does the term 'best friend' means according to his own definition, and, like what I've guessed, he never actually thought about it.   It just seem strange to me that we can know a word and use it so often yet we never really think about the true meaning of the word, or in other words, what does the word really mean to us.     And so that night we kind of discuss about each other's opinion, what does friends and best friend mean to us personally.   According to his opinion, my best friend would most probably be my wife. It's actually something for me to ponder about...   The thing is, I get along with girls quite well and girls are nice to talk with and be with. But there are just things that I won't talk to girls about...   So is it the same that there are just something a husband wouldn't tell a wife?       Last night I went to dinner with Kai Liing at Ameerali. We planned to go to cf together after dinner, and we even brought our bible along as well.   But as we were coming back from the coffee shop, he suddenly told me it might be the last time he'll be going, because he feel it's not nice going to two churches at once, although this is just a ca (campus alive) meeting.   And before we reach the van, he suddenly said to me :"I thinks I won't go today lar." With that he went back to the hostel.   It actually gave me a shock because I never encountered such a situation before. And it made me think as well, what's MY purpose of going to cf...      Sometimes I just feel that it's a obligation to go. And if I don't go, I don't feel right with God.    May be it's because I've not been spending enough quite times with God, so going to cf is a way I can make up for it...    But it can be that it' the only place where I can worship God and sing praises to him freely...   I'm not sure which is the real reason...maybe it's the combination of the two...    Today is my first time coming to Wai Peng's house in ss2 from Shah Alam by bus and lrt.    Well, it's sort of achievement to me, and I feel quite proud of myself that I can go about alone.   It gives me the feeling of independence : )    Still haven't memorize my Korean song yet...:~(. It seems to take a long time just to memorize a line.   Hopefully I can memorize it by Sunday afternoon...

      Well, I've prepared myself mentally to accept any unexpected stuff during the 5-day BTN Camp which starts this afternoon. Hopefully I'd be able to pull through it and come out in one piece...  Today reminds me of the orientation I had bout 2 months ago. There was also this morning that we were free and I went to a cyber cafe with Rose and another guy, Peter if I remember correctly. I know I'm being sentimental but I just can't help it. 3 months ago I was only prepared to say "goodbye" to all my secondary school's friends. Yet now I had to bid farewell to the friends I met in Kolej Matrikulasi Labuan and soon all the friends I have in INTEC here.  Here's something I came across recently:    F orgive each other   R efresh each other  I nvest in each other  E ncourage each other  N urture each other  D epend on each other  S hare with each other  H elp each other  I nspire each other  P ray for each other

      Just finished my Korean exam today. So now I can at least sit back and relax for few weeks before having to do any study (not that I did much study anyway, but I'll try to do better.)  Well, frankly I think I did quite well for the exam this morning, considering the amount of time I spent doing my revision. But we still have our speaking test once we arrive in Korea.  Hopefully I do well in it. I really want the incentive provided by Seoul National University.  Just to make things clear: We'll be studying 6 levels of Korean, and if we manage to get 90% and above for 5 consecutive levels (which is hard but not impossible), we'll be awarded with 1/2 the tuition fee for the next level, which I still don't exactly know how much, but better than none.   Today is the last day I'll be seeing the ALMs, and I'm really overcome with emotions. Even when I was having my exam I was thinking about them.  To all ALMs: farewell and God bless

      Saturday 3.00a.m  Was preparing myself for bed.  Had a fun night in Cyber Jaya. After all, this is the last time I attend the cell group. I doubt that I'll be joining it again six years later when I come back from Korea.  Saturday 5.00a.m  Arrggg!!!! There was this unbearable pain in my stomach. My intestine and stomach was squirming inside, turning and twisting here and there.  "Never mind, get back to sleep, this is just another nightmare." I was telling myself.  "How can my stomach hurt so much unless I'm dreaming. After all,I think I had this dream before, few weeks ago."  Never the less, the pain never decreased. It was getting worse and worse.   " O God! Stop this pain! I know if You're willing to You can!"   Yet there was another "suggestion" that arose in my mind, "Look, the balcony is just a few steps from you and it's not closed, just jump down from it. You'll just die and be in heaven and the pain will be gone. Isn't that wonderful?"  This suggestion seemed so tempting that I was actually considering it. Yet before I could take any action, another idea pop up in my mind : " Just take some panadols. It's a pain killer. It will take care of the pain."  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  And so I knocked at my grandma's room and asked her for some panadols. Yet it didn't do much good.  As my aunt and grandma was going to the doctor that morning, I went with them and got the confirmation from the doctor that I had food poisoning.  And thus the last Saturday that I could roam around in KL was spent taking medicine and resting at home.

      Since the first day I came here, I've been asking God to give me a friend whom I can really relate to. And last night I've just met one. But ironically, he'll be having his holidays soon while I'll be away for my camp and I'm flying off in 3 weeks time.  I was having dinner with Wei Sian last night. We were talking there after dinner when  he  came to have his dinner as well. Seeing that he was alone, I "forced"  him  to join us. The three of us were just talking and debating about praying for our food, going into mission, doing devotions etc etc etc. Wanting to spend more time  together, the two of us went for ABC after dinner. And I guess that was when our relationship started to build.  Yet deep within I can't hide the fact that I feel sad because here is someone whom I really like, whom I can share my thoughts with,whom I can relate to, but we'll be heading separate paths soon. I don't understand. If God wanted us to be friends, why not sooner? Why now? But who am I to question God. He's timing is never wrong.   His  experience is that  he  got closer with  his  former friends after being apart. Yet from my experience it's the other way round.  Well, may be as he'd said:"We'll meet in heaven."

           For the first time, as far as I can recall, I woke up late for class, and I mean REALLY late.      It's still bothering me, how did I ever manage to wake up at 9.50a.m when my class starts at 9a.m?       It's not like I slept late or what, I was already in bed at 11p.m last night!!      But fortunately my lecturer didn't get angry at me. She was actually QUITE shock seeing me knocking at the door with my uncombed hair at 10.15a.m in the morning.      Well, better late than never isn't?       3 more weeks before I leave for Korea.      I've been unconscience of the passing time. It's hard to imagine that I've been here for nearly 3 months.      What have I accomplish?      I didn't do my maths revision well enough and I don't think I did it well during the test just now. It's too late for me to do anything.       But, there's still my Korean language exam next week. Hopefully I'll do well in it.

      6 days not connected to the cyber world and my mailbox exceeded its limit.  I thought I will be able to gain access to the internet freely once I got home, yet to my shock the computer isn't there anymore!! The truth is, my brother brought it back to UTM, Johor with him. I can't put the blame on him because he didn't know I'll be going back so soon and the computer was already collecting dust at home.  Anyway, coincidentally I was back just in time to attend the memorial service and funeral of my church member who was among the 7 involved in the helicopter incident. I was hearing lots of rumor concerning the incident saying that the jungle is 'dirty' , 'creepy' and all the sorts, that's why the rescue team couldn't find the copter though it was just 5 minutes flying distance from the rescue teams' headquarter. I don't really believe what was said, but I haven come up with my own theory yet. Maybe we'll never know the actual reason. One main thing mentioned by the preachers during the memorial service was the question: "Why bad things happen to good people?" The answer given was: "We may never be able to come up with a good answer to the question while we're still on earth." It reminds me of the time when I used to ask my Sunday School teachers and youth leaders the same question. The answer that i got was : bad things happen because of people's sin; quoting Job's case and saying that it's a trial or test, and that at the end of the day Job was blessed. Yet in real life when things do happen, all these spoon-fed answer just didn't fit into the picture. I guess this is where faith plays it's role. *sigh*
