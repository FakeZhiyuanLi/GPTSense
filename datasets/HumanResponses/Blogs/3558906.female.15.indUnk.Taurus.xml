      Well nothing really bad has happend. I just thought I would update. My dog Heidi had me worried Wednesday night. But she is better now. All the animals are doing good. Now we are thinking about going to the lake. Woohoo.... getting away from this boring house. There isn't really anything to do. So I guess thats about it.

       Well I got up this morning and I decided to have some breakfast like every other normal person. So I get up and I sit in the over sized chair in the den. I pet the animals make sure there all ok. Then I get up go to the kitchen and cook some eggs. So after I cook the eggs I go to the dinning room table and eat my eggs. After that I go rinse off my plate and go to the den and try to watch tv. Guess what the tv has been turned off. Nice huh.. what I'm I going to do all day. There isn't anything ealse to do. I don't know what I should do. Online isn't that much interesting any more. All there is to do is update my journals and then chat with some people and look to see that Warped Tour tickets are still there. It's all the same everyday I do this at least 3 times a day. I don't know why. I should just search for dumb shit. but I really don't want to. oh well.... I guess I need to go see what I could do today. Well see ya later....

      Well I just found Blogger. I found it from a journal off of Blurty.com. I decided to see what it was about and I did. Now I am here writing something. Everyday it seems like I am writing something. I don't know what it is. I just wake up in the morning just wanting to write. Maybe I was a writer in my past life. Who knows?   Well I guess I could be a writer in the future but I don't count on the future. I live everyday to the fullest. I believe anything can happen in a second or in a day. I think everyone shouldn't keep planning what is going to happen tomorrow or the next year. Everyone spends to much time on that. Everyday shouldn't be planning it should be fun and joy. Weather you hate your job or like it. You should make fun happen there. If you can't move on there are plenty jobs out there for you to find fun in. Nothing should hold you down on your life. Well I guess I shouldn't keep going on what I believe. You all should know a little about me.  My name is Michele most people call me Moshell or Moe. I got it from this little kid that could pronounce my name right, and one of my friends caught on to it and kept it. So I live in Asheville, North Carolina ( that's were you cry). I go to Erwin High School ( that's were you cry more). I am 15 years old. I hate were I live and the bad reputation at my school. Everyone talks bad about it because there was a shooting there and a lot of riots because the stupid people who run it fire the best teachers and OFFICERS. Like this past year they got rid of Officer Wolfe. He was the best officer that there ever is. They got rid of him because of Suzie Moore fucking Mr. Whats his face. I don't know his name so that's why I say that. So yeah stupid reasons. Oh well... They can keep doing it the riots are fun. Getting out of class is the best.   So now it is summer. There hasn't been much happening. Other than my goal and proceeding it. My goal is to reach a size 8, but you know I might get there if I stay alive. No one can predict when someone is going to die. Like to day I might go outside and get killed by a car. See know one knows. Oh well I guess we'll have to see.
