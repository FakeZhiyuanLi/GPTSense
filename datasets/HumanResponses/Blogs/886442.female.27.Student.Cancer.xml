      Today, I had an exam. The Capital Markets Board of Turkey now requires that all employees in the investment banking sector obtain licenses to resume their current positions and this license will be awarded to people who pass this exam made up of all kinds of subjects ranging from financial math to economics to what not. I understand that this is what the European Union is doing and we would like to be a part of the Union and so on. How was my exam? Never mind. Actually, I didn't bring up the subject to discuss the exam. The only good part of it was the exam site. It was held at the premises of Istanbul University which is amazingly beautiful. The university lies on the other side of the Bosphorous in what we call 'the old city' where all the grand mosques, cisterns, Hagia Sophia, the Topkapi Palace and the Grand Bazaar are. It's far away from where I live.   In the 3-hour interim between the morning and the afternoon sittings (yes, the exam was supposed to last a total of 6 hours in two sittings held on the same day, never mind how much of it I could take!!), I wandered around 'the old city'. In that part of Istanbul, tourists outnumber the nationals by the way. Strolling around and watching tourists it just happened that I started seeing the city, my city, the way tourists see it. At least the way I think they see it. On the way back home I skipped public transportation and walked all the way down to the seaside and stood there for a long time watching the Galata Tower and the intricate web of old houses surrounding it. It all seemed so different to me. I have seen this view countless times before yet it felt as if it was the first. I felt as if I was watching a movie. I was completely out of it all and stood there in awe. How lucky I am to be living here I thought.   Then I took the ferry to the Anatolian side and on the ferry I sat outside in the wind and watched the sea and the city skyline. I tried to locate exactly at what points in the picture most of my life is spent. Where I work, where I live, the favorite places I visit. I imagined myself in those places and looking at Istanbul from the outside I felt a stranger although I make miles ang go distances in it everyday.   Then everything just clicked into perspective for a split second. I sensed that If I can look at my life, myself, and what I do from the outside instead of drowning myself in daily trivia, everything will become clearer. By zooming out, I will actually be able to bring into focus the things of real importance. New ways to see old things will maybe then appear.

       Can one ever be purely herself?     Does authenticity really exist or are we just a fusion of outside effects?   Sometimes “I” feel as if there is nothing as “I”. Because to be able to say I exist, I feel I have to imagine myself existing in and of myself, with no one to talk to, no sound to hear, no sight to see, no one or nothing to touch. What would happen to me then? Is there the remotest chance that I can go on being “myself”? I don’t think so. The me that you see today was, and still is being, created by the world. I am the books I’ve read, the people I’ve met (the ones I understood, the ones I didn’t, the ones I hated as well as the ones I loved), everything I’ve touched, everything I’ve seen and heard. If you decide to  urlLink write to me  today and make yourself heard, what will happen is that you’ll join in the creation. My creation. And when you think about it, with you reading this, I have already joined in yours.  You will never be the you who has not read what you just have. Don’t you feel a little violated? Funny ha!  And when you think about it this way, what makes us unique is the special combination. There is no other person on the face of this earth who has sensed exactly the same things as you have. And this is what makes each of us authentic.

      I have this problem. I am constantly on the lookout for something that will change my life forever. It doesn’t have to be someone or something I’ve never encountered, I even expect that it will be related in some way to something I already have or know about. I think what I’m trying to say is that I need a new mindset, I need a whole new perspective on life. I need to learn how to see things in more than one way. I am at a loss of meaning.   Whatever I do, I keep asking myself  “Ok. Now that you’ve done that, are you any different?” “What has this taught you?” Like everything has to teach me something! But still, I crave for meaning, a higher purpose.  There are two things in life that come with their meanings inherent. One is science and the other is art. What renders them meaningful is that one can profess either one just for its own sake and be completely satisfied by the process rather than the product. There is no end product to either one anyway and all intermediate products come with their meaning inherent as well.   The paradoxical thing here is that art and science have completely different ways of advancing. Science is linear, meaning it is all cause and effect while art moves in leaps, back and forth, in pursuit of the little tidbits of meaning flying in the air and that is how it advances best. But they serve the same purpose which is to explain life, though they may strangely end up complicating it rather than simplifying and do it with such grace that you end up feeling that complication and simplification are one and the same thing. Art and science are also both liberating in the sense that you are free to discover meaning and you are equally free to create your own.   It follows that my being at a loss of meaning must be for lack of intellectual stimulation. I need constantly to feel that I am unfolding each day some small mystery of life that makes for the unfolding of an even greater mystery, the mystery of existence, of creation itself.

      On the way back home from work, my bus, the company paid staff bus, passes through a long street along one side of which runs a cemetery. Whenever the traffic slows down on that particular street, I start reading the tombstones. It’s an old cemetery, all occupied. Depending on the exact point the traffic slows down, you get a chance to view only so many stones. At the start of the road, there are the oldest tombs, with names and dates and what else written on them in Arabic. Then further up come the relatively younger tombs, say from the start of the century and this goes on till the other end of the road where you have the most recent ones the inhabitants of which deceased in the 90s.   Today, the traffic slowed down closer to the beginning of the road where the turn of the century stones stand. I saw this one stone which I have never recognized before. It belonged initially to a man who lived between 1902 – 1931. Died young. However, it also said on the stone that his beloved wife was buried there as well so that they could lie in each other’s arms for all eternity. The surprising thing was that the wife was buried in 1999. She was married to a man who died at the age of 29 and she outlived him 68 long years. 68 years of life without the man she loved, yet it appears that she never remarried and wished to be buried where he was. 68 years is longer than the life some get to live.   I thought about the type of life she may have had. Maybe she had given him children before his 29 years and maybe those children were her consolation for the remaining 68 years of her life. But again, maybe they were just married when he died and she did not even get to say good-bye. Maybe they were childhood sweethearts who married when they were still children and had no offspring. Who knows? I will try next time to see whether there are other stones nearby belonging to members of the same family. Maybe then will I get to learn more.

       I am actually pretty new to this blogging thing. I have been reading blogs for over a year now and I thought it's time I launched my own. What you will find in Ceren's Garden is a collection of information about me, my booklogs, a weblog, and anything else that I find worthy of mentioning. My writing here is obviously intended for an audience but I also intend it as a manifestation of my new life where I will start living out what I have been dreaming of and planning for all my 25 years. I know this last sentence sounds weird to all those who do not know me, but I am afraid to those who do know me, it will sound just like me.         Ok. So who am I? My name is Ceren Arik and I am a Turkish woman of 25 who works as auditor at a foreign private investment bank in Istanbul, Turkey. I am Turkish and I had my secular education in an American school, which I am pretty proud of,  here in Istanbul and hence the English.   The first weblog I read was dear Karen Grünberg's  urlLink Karenika . I came upon her page while I was looking for some cool Istanbul pictures to send to an American friend of mine. I was at work and you're not supposed to surf the net while at work but I couldn't help it. I read half the content of her site (yes, including the archives) right that day and read the remaining half at home that night. At the end I started feeling like she was my friend but the problem was she wasn't. Still, the feeling was wonderful. I thought we had a lot in common as far as feelings go but we just reflected in ways totally different. She is this wonderful manic caring person (don't know if you'll agree with the 'manic' part, Karen) who's in love with life and who wants to make time for yet another wonderful activity each day.  On the other hand, I cannot handle the intense love I have for life and my amazement at its ways as well as Karen can. It turns out that I am depressed rather than manic. The manic and the depressed have a lot in common, that is something I have always believed in. But of course I am talking about a certain type of depressed. Mine is more a way of being, of existing, rather than a condition. Well, so much for depression anyway. You just make sure you read Karen's pages too along with mine. And thank you Karen for inspiring me the way you have for keeping a blog and trying to make the best out of life.   I have to go now, I'll take this up tomorrow from where I leave it, so see you then.

      My life is marked by a series of reading experiences that changed its major course. The first of these was reading encyclopedias at age 10. How telephone lines were wired across oceans on the ocean floor kilometers down from the surface, how planes could actually fly, how Fibonacci added up the first two numbers in a sequence to get the third number and so on to form the number sequence that was named after himself, how some species of butterflies the bright colors of which attract hungry birds are distasteful so that they can be spared and much much more were all in between the two hard covers. All the knowledge of the world to a 10 year old.  The second one was reading “The Catcher in the Rye” for my English class when I, in my 15 year old mind, was feeling crushed under all the beautiful experiences the world had to offer because I somehow didn’t know how best to handle them all at the same time. The bright kid that I was, was feeling all lost when Holden showed me that I wasn’t the only one and that it was okay.    And then came “Kara Kitap”, “the Black Book” by Orhan Pamuk at age 18 when I was waiting anxiously for the results of the nationally administered university placement exam. I devoured the 400 pages in just two days and by the time it was finished I was begging for more because it was the sort of book one could go on writing and others could go on reading forever. I can’t say I understood it in all its profundity back then. The main character was searching for something so vague that I could only sense it. Set in the rich fabric of Ýstanbul, it was life lived in words, as text.   Then I read “the Black Book” again this past summer at age 25 and saw that all the things I sensed in my first reading I now comprehended as well.     THE BLACK BOOK as I understand it..   “Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself. (I am large, I contain multitudes.)”  		Walt Whitman, “Song of Myself”  The Black Book is a seeming detective story set in Ýstanbul in which Galip searches for his beloved lost wife, Rüya, who also happens to be his cousin and best friend. At some point during his search, it occurs to him that Rüya is hiding with the renowned columnist Jelal, who is her intellectual older half-brother and Galip’s lifetime idol whose columns he has been reading devotedly every morning since his childhood.   Galip’s search for Rüya is the enveloping detective story of the novel. However, the novel is structured such that chapters where Galip’s quest for Rüya alternate with Jelal’s column for the day where each column reads like a response to the events of the chapter preceding it. And furthermore in each chapter or column, there are other stories and sometimes stories within stories that make the novel resemble a matruchka baby. Since all babies inside are twin models of the mother, it is now clear why the book seemed to me like it would (and should) never end. It just keeps reproducing itself only to tell the same stories over and over again through different mouths.   The first thing that we need to establish is the relationship that is apparent between the characters in the Black Book and those of famous Eastern narratives which are referred to in the novel. Galip refers to Sheikh Galip who authored the famous Hüsn-ü Aþk (Beauty and Love) which is a seeming love story of two kids from the same tribe. Aþk (Love) is ordered by the elderly tribesmen to go to Diyar-ý Kalb (the heart of the land) to bring back the magic potion in order to earn the priviledge to marry Hüsn (Beauty). Along the seemingly endless journey he encounters many a beast, a witch, falls into a well and is seduced by princesses. He is saved from each trap with the help of a wise old man who then helps him understand when he reaches Diyar-ý Kalb that Beauty is really in himself and the essential journey one has to make is the journey into one’s own heart. It is clear that the framing story in the Black Book was modelled after this Eastern narrative. Galip (who is also the first person – the writer- in half the book) is searching for his wife Rüya (which is the Turkish word for dream) and encounters obstacles just like Aþk and is guided by Jelal’s columns during the journey. In other words, Jelal is the wise old man showing him the way into his own heart.   The surprise comes however, when we realize, when we are told in the novel, that Jelal, Galip’s idol, has been lifting all the stories he has been telling in his columns from the famous Mevlana Jelalettin Rumi who elaborated on the dichotomy between essence and its reflection (and hence the name Jelal). “...Galip realized that many a column he had supposed was original when he read it in his teenage years was in fact a story Jelal had lifted from the Mathnawi and adapted to our present-day Ýstanbul.” (225) All of a sudden, we are left with the sense that nothing is real. And as Galip relates “According to Jelal, like all those people who cannot endure being themselves for long and find solace only in assuming another person’s identity, Rumi too, in narrating a story, could only tell what someone else had already told. Besides, for such unhappy souls, storytelling was a trick devised to escape from their own tedious bodies and spirits. The Mathnawi was a an odd and messy “composition” just like the Thousand and One Nights, where a second story begins when the first one has not yet ended, a third is taken up before the second is done –endless stories, always left behind.” (225) The Mathnawi and the Thousand and One Nights, the odd and messy composition that they are, are what the story inside the framing detective story of the novel is modelled after. Both in Galip’s narrations and in Jelal’s we are being conveyed the stories of third parties. It can be concluded that the Black Book is a consolidation of the Eastern literary art of storytelling. With the Black Book, Pamuk pays tribute to this art and adds to it his contention that literature is never free of other literature. “...Jelal would say that he wrote many of his columns, perhaps all, with the help of others; he claimed that the crucial thing was not “creating” something new but taking something astonishingly wonderful that had been worked on by thousands of intellects over thousands of years, elegantly changing it here and there, and transforming it into something new.” (226) Pamuk fulfills the quest in such a way that the Black Book reads like a tedious thread of mathematical equations written out in answer to the math question ‘prove that literature is never free of literature that precedes it’.   It has been much debated whether Pamuk has lifted from other writers, Eastern and Western, classic and contemporary alike. I think those who have participated in such debates have not understood what the Black Book is about at all. What Pamuk does is not plagiarism, he is trying to make a point that there actually is nothing as authenticity and in this frame of reference the word plagiarism loses its meaning.   Pamuk states the point clearly on more than one occasion. The epigraph to the chapter “Mysterious Paintings” which is one of Jelal’s columns goes like this: “I appropriated the mystery from the Mathnawi. – SHEIKH GALIP”  The line following this in Sheikh Galip’s Hüsn-ü Aþk (Beauty and Love) says “Appropriated what’s as good as anonymous.” However, this second line is for the reader to look up, it is not included as part of the epigraph. Pamuk sees the Mathnawi from which Sheikh Galip claims to have lifted the idea for his own story as good as anonymous since he believes that Rumi lifted the idea for his masterpiece from works still earlier. “...Jelal has written in one of his unpublished pieces that ‘Rumi’s Mathnawi, which is considered his greatest work, is nothing but plagiarism from beginning to end.’ “ (225)  The characters, Rüya and Jelal exist in the novel only as reflections of their real selves. We see Rüya only briefly in two chapters before she leaves Galip. In the first chapter when Galip talks about their childhood in the Heart-of-the-City apartments and later as the indifferent housewife who reads cheap detective novels as a favorite pastime. The only time we actually hear her talk is when she takes the call from Galip on the day she disappears. And again in that call, she does not seem to be responding to Galip but talking to herself. Rüya is actually a dream just like her name implies, she is Galip’s dream. Her dreamlike appearance is hinted at in the following: “Rüya’s chin was buried in the down pillow. In the curve of her brow there was something surreal that brought on anxious curiosity about the wondrous events that took place inside her head.” (3)    Jelal, whom Galip has been idolizing ever since his childhood, on the other hand, is represented in the novel by his writings -his columns- and in turn their effect on Galip. Given that the reader is acquainted with Rüya and Jelal as Galip relates, it can be deduced that Galip acts like a mirror reflecting the images of Rüya and Jelal and when one day, they both disappear, Galip is left without an identity. As a result, his search for Rüya and Jelal first in the labyrinthine streets of Ýstanbul and  then in the intricate folds of his own mind, turns into a search for his own identity, a search for the mystery device that has turned him into the mirror he is and a search for meaning and the purpose as to why all this happened.   Throughout the novel we are constantly reminded of the macro and micro levels of cosmos. “..when we noticed on the back cover the picture of a girl reading the magazine we were holding in our hands; and, when we examined the magazine the girl held in her hand, we realized the pictures had multiplied inside each other: the girl on the cover of the magazine that we held was holding the magazine on the cover of which the girl held the magazine on the cover of which the girl was holding the magazine who was the same redheaded girl and the same Children’s Week that got incrementally smaller and smaller.” (320) This prompts me to think of a big circle as representing the enveloping story. It is what seems, what is apparent at first glance. Let that circle represent Galip’s search for Rüya. Then imagine other smaller circles inside that big one. Let those smaller circles represent Galip’s search for Jelal and hence the search for his own identity. The reason why this search is represented by a number of smaller circles rather than one big circle is because this quest is not obvious at first glance and is also made up of smaller quests. At the core lies the most important circle representing Galip’s search for the ultimate mystery, the meaning.  Now imagine the smaller circles as lined alongside the interior of the big circle and let them turn in the direction opposite to which the big circle and the circle at the center turn. Where the quests refer to each other, where they have implications on each other, where they run into each other, in other words at the points where the circles momentarily contact each other, the meaning Galip searches for appears momentarily and disappears since the circles are in motion. Therefore I call these contact points ‘sparks’. And since there are an infinite number of such sparks, there is no one meaning but an infinite number of them.   The folly of the person looking for the ultimate meaning is assuming that there is one. It is possible however, that all circles have other smaller circles inscribed which have even smaller circles inscribed inside which lie still smaller circles... Life has therefore a fragmental structure. All the small pieces life is made up of are worlds in themselves, as delicately designed as the circumscribing world, and for any one person in any one circle looking for the meaning, the greatest discovery would be to realize that fragmental structure. “He read a great many pages attesting that God’s essential attribute was a “hidden treasure” (a kenz-i mahfi), a mystery. The question was to find a way to get it. The question was to realize that the mystery was reflected in the world. The question was to comprehend that the mystery was present in everything, every object, every person. The world was an ocean of clues, every one of its drops had the salty taste that led to the mystery behind it.” (262) The only way a person will experience meaningfulness is if and when he creates it. The mind pondering the question therefore is the core, and discovering yourself is the same as discovering the mystery of existence. “Anyone who wished to set forth on the road and establish a new universe must begin by discovering the letters in his own face.” (279)    This brings us to the problematic of method. How does one set about on the greatest hunt of one’s life, the search for the “hidden treasure”? Apart from Galip, Rüya, and Jelal there is a secret fourth main character in the book and that is the experience of reading and interpretation. As I have mentioned before, what we know of Rüya and Jelal is merely out of text, we do not hear them talk or see them act. We see Galip “reading” these two persons with whom we understand he was closest and interpreting them as if they were texts. Interpretation is an act that follows reading because it is the mechanism of filling the voids in our reading where we think something is missing or not quite clear. This gives us an idea about the type of method Galip will choose. The only way he interacts with the world is by reading it as if it were a text and interpreting. So he thinks the mystery of acquiring identity must be somewhere within texts. Galip has no other choice but to track the meaning in between the lines, be they on faces, in the maze of Ýstanbul’s streets or on paper. “..that’s when you realized it wasn’t for nothing that the word in our language for the stuff that turns glass into mirror is the same as the word for ‘secret.’ After divulging this moment of insight in one of your columns, you’d said this: Reading is looking in the mirror; those who know the ’secret’ behind the glass manage to go through the looking glass; and those who have no knowledge of letters will find nothing more in the world other than their own dull faces.” (309) That this is a difficult task in itself is apparent. There are two large texts for Galip to decipher. History, as accumulated through the centuries layer over layer, memory as accumulated through the years bank by bank and reflected in writing which is nothing else other than the collective memory of humankind.   At the point where Galip realizes that Jelal’s column which has been published for over thirty years is going to appear as blank if new columns are not supplied to the newspaper since the ones Jelal left are about to expire in a couple of days, to prevent this from happening he started writing columns and sending them to the newspaper as if they were Jelal’s. Therefore It is apparent that self-realization for Galip is becoming a text himself, because he cannot extract meaning in any other way. In other words he needs to become the writer to survive. What is more meaningful for him than trying to become Jelal, the writer he has been idolizing all the while. The irony is apparent, he is searching for his identity but what comes as self-realization to Galip is actually no other than imitation. There simply is nothing as authenticity. The Black Book should therefore be read as one man’s journey to becoming a writer. And to become a writer you should contain multitudes of selves.

      I had the weirdest dream last night. Even now, I am anxious that what I felt during the dream will be reproduced as I write about it.  In the dream, I come to myself from a spell and find out that the baby I was pregnant with was gone from my womb. I try to think and track it back to when I was last conscious but all I remember is being aware that I had a C-section appointment scheduled for Thursday. When I come to my senses, it is not yet Thursday but the baby's gone. I think that maybe I had an early delivery but I can't make out why I am not with my baby. Then I think that maybe I was allowed out of the hospital with the baby but fell unconscious and lost it or had it stolen though I do not remember having given birth. Then I say to myself maybe the doctors were wrong from the very beginning, maybe I had no baby inside of me, maybe it was all a pseudo-pregnancy but then I remember the ultrasound pictures and actually having seen my baby inside of me. While I am thinking these, I am wandering all over Istanbul, still dizzy-nauseous-hurting and crying hard, through crowded marketplaces and empty construction sites with streets ending up dead or stairs ending in the middle of nowhere. I am the only connection to my baby and I am almost killed, seconds from being run over by cars (countless times) and misled by strangers whom I ask for help. And finally when I make it home, it is not the home I remember. My mother, my brother and distant relatives whose faces I can't make out are there. I do not know what to say to my mother. I try to lie but I am too ruined to make up one.  At this point it was 5:30 in the morning and the alarm went off. I had to get up early today because Burak (my bf) had to drive his mother to Chicago to catch a flight and drive back to Akron before the end of the day. I got up to say bye. Then I could not sleep and thought I would mail some friends from work so that they will find mails in their boxes when they arrive in the morning only to realize (after I mailed them) that it was Sunday !! Obviously I had been turned all inside out.  Hope such dreams do not recur in the future.

      Whenever I say I'm gonna do something, I end up not doing it, or somehow doing it not so the way I talked of doing it. My moods change so quickly that I end up not keeping promises. The thing is I do not just make promises, I really mean them when I make them. And I am not talking about big promises here, life altering decisions I am quick to make and I almost always keep such big promises. But when it comes to the little things (or are they not as little as I think they are??) a change of my mood turns me into a different person and I end up wanting to do things differently. Tonight I think of going running in the morning but then in the morning I wake up wanting to do something completely different. So it's kind of like I cannot keep the promises I make to myself. For this reason alone, I do not want to make plans. I do not know how I will be feeling at a certain time in the future even if that future is half an hour later. I am a wonderful dreamer and a lousy planner. I am tired of this roller coaster of my emotions.  And there are the things that I will keep wanting for all eternity no matter what mood I am in. The problem with those are that I am always in the process of getting there and never feel completely accomplished. Maybe it's because I can never really define what it is that I really want. What I want is an ever changing ever evolving thing, so much that I am always one day short of accomplishing it.
