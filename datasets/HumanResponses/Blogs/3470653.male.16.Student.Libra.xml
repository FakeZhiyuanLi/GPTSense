      When I was born my Grandfather said to my mother if you keep that child we will never speak again. My mother obviously kept me. Over time he had learnd to like me and even come to love me. But, what he had to deal with was that my Grandmother and I had an awesome relationship that my grandfather did not want to step into our time. But when my grandmother died he felt that it was now his tme to get to know me and even start a relationship. As time grew long our friendship became stronger. But he was diagnosed with cancer a while ago and when he told me that he was going to die soon it really put a strain on our relationship. But that starin never really stopped us from having fun. But then one terrible night in September he passed away. But I will always know that no matter where I am or what i am doing he will always be there to watch oveer me and take care of me just like he did for my entire life.

      My biggest problem would have been that the day just went by to slow. I am sure that who ever reads this has had one of those days where the day just dosen't want to speed up a little bit. But when something good happens it just decides to speed up. Example, when I am sitting in History class and the teacher is just talking and talking and dosen't want to do anything on a FRIDAY such as a game or a good movie to speed things up. But then on the other hand when i am in music class the period just wants to fly by and not slow down.   This weekend on the other hand will during the day speed up and slow down and the same over and over until you just cant take it anymore and freak out and smoke cigarettes until you are dizzy. Then when you are working the night shift at a gas station the time is VERY VERY slow more so when they decide to put a clock right in front of you and it is huge so you cant avoid it.

      Hey  Yeah i know the first one sucked but they are getting better. Well as though anyone who comes accross this site have never heard of me i will tell you a little about me. Well, what is there to tell about me. I am 16 years old I have a younger brother and sister. I live in Ontario, Canada. I go to high school soon to graduate. When I leave high school and go on to college i would like to become a Paramedic. But right now i work midnights on the weekends at a gas station called Shell. But any way really honestly and truly my like does suck. Well, maybe not really it just has its downs. Naming on asshole named mike but I cant really do much about it. He is my moms boy friend who is a leeching piece of shit who is controlling and has no life. He has no manners, picks on kids that are 30 years younger then hime because he couldn't win a fight with a man his own age. But he really isn't a man though. He drives my moms vehicles gets pissed off when i dont listen to him because i treat him like pond scum. But now that the un pleasentries a out of the way.

						   Well all in all it was an okay flight as far as the flying weent. But as far as the food went I had might as well decided to eat my DC Skateboarding shoes. But if I had done that I really would not have had much to wear now would I. I have really not done much today except really just go for a walk and get used to all of the sort of BRITISH rules like driving on the wrong side of the road. But I am having a great time and I wish that I had more to write but being my first day I really cant write more except that I unpaked all of my clothes and I am going to go with my aunt to go and watch her teach at he college which will be alot of fun. I will talk to you all later.

						   Well, I am really excited about heading out on my trip. I leave on Monday to England and I am going to have such a fantastic time. I am going to stay with my Great Aunt and Uncle and we are going to have such a great time. I am though a little nervous about flying out on my own. Knowing me I will get lost and take a flight out to some god foresaken island where not even vegetation live. But i guess i can not really get on the wrong plane. I am going to have such a great time though. I was really and truely awsome of my aunt and uncle to pay for my flight out and   I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF WHAT IS ABOUT TO COME   Well I will keep anyone who is reading posted about my trip out there.
