      I'm a blue belter now!!! I'm so happy! we had our promotion test last Saturday. feels good to spar without control, to hit and to shout without considering what others would say (because you are expected to hit and shout as hard as you can)...

      it's almost the end of the day... accomplished a bit of work at least. Somehow my lazy streak has eased a bit.  by the way, I met my crush, Superman, along South Super Highway while jogging last night. Good thing I was all sweaty - at least he didn't see me blush. :-p Then to top it all off, we came across our TKD classmate (he's a model for Levi's, Tanduay, etc) near Makati Square. We made a bit of chitchat... haha he sure makes TKD fun!  I'm just waiting for taek practice. I'm meeting my best friend tonight. Haven't seen her since July... I'm still sick but happy... Can't wait...

      great weekend... spent the entire Saturday in bed because of some virus - I had to be ready for my date that night. Well, ok, more because I had to be ready for my taekwondo practice. in any case, I had fun that night - amidst sniffles and runny nose and slight fever. Slept at 2am already... sunday I went to mass and learned that my fave priest, Father Bob, is going to be reassigned already. Sad. =( I went to Taekwondo again (as usual) in Rockwell Club and then met up with my cuz Ni√±o (aka F4) later. We went to our cuz' birthday that night.  Tiring weekend, but well, worth it...  Now back to work, first thing I had a meeting in Unilever. Whew.

      i'm going badminton with my officemates later tonight... i only have tkd TThSatSun, so i spend my energy on other activities. sometimes I go jogging with my tkd friend, Chona. I'm still kinda sick, but I don't like staying at home at all. I have enough of that during weekends. I hope I can make it to our outing in Puerto Galera next week. My mom is coming from the province so I'm still uncertain...

      a lazy Friday afternoon... after launching three projects and releasing a topline report during the first half of this week, i'm left with long hours of just lazing around and pretending to work... well at least until fieldwork gets done. I'm currently working on getting sponsors for my team's upcoming tournament in Rockwell. Hope it works out.

      went wall climbing last night in play underground in Rockwell... exhilarating, but I felt that I needed more time. We were trying to climb the rightmost wall, but then again, we had to give up around 1/3 of the way... hehe too challenging for us. The rocks were too far away from one another, and they were too thin to hold on to. Perhaps next time. It's a challenge I'm willing to take until the time I'm able to climb all the way. I was able to climb only about 5x because we (me, Lee, and Annrhee) were taking turns climbing kc there's no one to belay... Kakabitin!  It's still an exhilarating experience to climb and let go, quite unlike taekwondo. Unlike taekwondo though, where I don't give up and never say that I can't do it, in wall climbing it's ok to say "I'll try it next time" and just let go. :-p   I do hope I can find wall climbing partners whom I can climb with at least twice a month. :-) any takers? :-)   anyways, back to work now. I'm going home to Cotabato next week. Be back Saturday, but I'm flying from Davao. We're visiting my sis who's taking charge of Psychiatric Nursing there for the summer.   TTFN!

      it's another rainy day... actually i'm glad i weigh a bit heavy coz i would've been blown by the wind had i been any lighter hehe. i realized that i didn't have enough change to get a cab to the office this morning so I took a jeepney despite the strong winds. whew. anyways, i'm trying to avoid this guard in our condo unit. why do i always attract the wrong market??? I don't even have a "lady in distress" image, can't have it even if I tried! O well. In any case, I have to get back to work. We have badminton later, so got to finish as much work as I can. Had TKD till 10pm last night. My friend's boyfriend saw me on my way home last night and wouldn't believe I was just going home from training. Oh well. I'm sleepy. Time for some cappucino. ZzzzzZZZ

      wow... it's been more than two months since my last post... so many things have already happened since then. I've been home, gone back here... and i haven't even realized it's been that long since i last had the time to write. in any case, projects have began arriving, and there are so many issues on my mind right now. Surprisingly, I manage to stay afloat and happy - perhaps because it's just a change of attitude. My director has called on me to start my journey towards maturity. Whew. Hard, but I guess in the end it will pay off. It's never easy, and I didn't want to make promises I can't keep, but I want to make a commitment to myself that this time, I'll try hard enough... for my own sake - to mature and to take accountability for my actions... and be happy with my decisions. :-)

      Time to fix my stuff and move cubicles. I'm gonna miss this one coz I've been here since I started (wow, nearly 3 years ago! August 16,2001). I was a fresh grad then. Now I'm no longer fresh haha. I can say so many things about my beginnings here in ACNielsen, like the terrifying interviews... panel interviews with the directors and managers... my first panel interviews! At that time my boss, Joyce, did not choose me as her first option because she says I lack confidence. I'm too scared of "people higher than I am". Now she says I'm oozing with confidence it's scary.&nbsp; I've become less inhibited and become wilder, a whole lot more talkative! hahahaha.... so great to reminisce, but I have a topline report to finish, some YM messages to respond to, a desk to finish cleaning and preparing for transfer, and other miscellaneous tasks to attend to. Get back to writing soon.

      Life is getting crazier by the minute... I was on my way home last night from TKD (around 11pm already) - I looked like I've been to hell and back because of the prax. All sweaty and my hair was all over my face. We walked all the way from Makati Square to the house so all I really wanted was to go to bed.  Then at the entrance of the building, I saw this guard. He's not entirely a new presence in my life (hehe), but having another guard admirer isn't something I want to deal with. Dunno why I attract these kinds of people. I don't have a lady in distress image - in fact I want to be perceived as strong and independent! He walked me to our house... I couldn't help but say that I feel like I have a body guard! O dear. I can't make "taray" or anything cause it's not really my nature (or unless really triggered!).&nbsp; He wants to attend my TKD class. Gawd.  Anyway, had fun last night in TKD. At the end of the class, instead of sparring, we had a "jump over" each of the classmates who were standing with knees bent and torsos bent 45% from the hips - I kinda knocked over a couple of the big guys - hard to jump over them.&nbsp; We had to use our hands to support us by placing them over their backs and propelling our bodies over. Super fun!

       It's been a few days since I last wrote. I guess I'm a bit tired of late night practices in TKD&nbsp;- I got home nearly 11pm last night, so I woke up late today... feels so good to go right back to sleep because of the cold weather! Nonetheless, I still look forward to every prax. :-)   Anyway, I&nbsp;found Easispecs&nbsp;tedious yesterday, as there were undetected bugs in the software that caused it to hang every so often (and with it, delete all my recent changes! argh!). We also had this pre-Let's&nbsp;Meet (an open forum thingy about the office environment&nbsp;- about any issues against the&nbsp;different departments, etc.). It's quite weird because I don't really have much issues. Or perhaps because I understand why people behave the way they do that's why I don't feel like it's a matter of life and death if they complain when I ask them to run some rush data. Oh well, I should understand because I usually run out of patience when I'm requested to rushly analyze data, and I'm normally in a ngarrr mode too. :-p In fact, I think I scared off an ex who called me at the wrong time and was making childish comments that I don't like to go on gimmicks with him anymore! What the hell?!? I don't have time for that crap, and not from him! Then my boss (my director, nothing less) approached my desk to consult on some cost estimates, so I had to hang up. Then he was asking if I wasn't mad for nearly shouting (I was losing patience already with his questions whether I can meet up with him after TKD on Sat, which ends at 10pm - during the time that we were still together, he complained about having to wait after 9pm, and now he says he can wait till 10! Like I believe him. GAwd.), I had to tell him that my director is by my side already, oh gawd! Patience is a virtue! He never called again. :-p   Oh no, we have a meeting at DLSU this afternoon... and I'm wearing a halter-type blouse! I gotta go to Greenbelt like right now to buy something decent. Oh well. Even Joyce learned about the meeting just now. Gawd!   Gotta go for now.

      I had a crazy day yesterday... I have this new project with a new methodology and we're all swimming in an unchartered territory. And our jobs are on the line! The clients are friends too so we really don't have any room for errors. Hanging on to my sanity. :-) Anyways, it's a good thing that I have TKD tonight - a couple of hours of busting stress would do me a whole lotta good. :-) I was in a bad mood the entire day yesterday. Around lunch time my manager told me I was pale. My hands were already trembling and all... We're briefing later today. Hope there aren't any more glitches. Oh well. Project Maximum is really getting maximum attention. hehe Now I'm a bit better, I guess. Breathe. Whew. I can do this. :-)

      I'm still in the office. Bugger. I have this project for launch next week and we're using an altogether new methodology (Brand Price Choice Modeling, a proprietary product)... I'm studying the software on top of the new research design and it's driving me nuts. I'm on a crazy, fighting mood the entire day. My manager even told me I'm turning out to be a nagger... Shitty. :-( In any case, I just realized I need time to think about my life, perhaps re-organize my priorities and think about what really matters. I seem to have put so many activities into my sked to keep me from thinking about what I really need to do, about how I should live my life, about what it is I really want to become. I've been in one hell of a crazy joyride in my life right now-- since last year I've began living my life in a way that I never thought I would, that I never thought my values would let me live by. I gave up a lot of my values and somehow I try to keep myself busy and occupied so I don't have time to contemplate and reason with myself to get back to the path that I know I should be taking. I know I should take charge of my life now. But it's scary because I know that once I allow myself to think about what I have been doing to my life, I might just cry... and I always wanted to be seen as strong, never vulnerable... and to add to my confusion I think I've become attached to someone for whom I realize I'm willing to compromise and share my life with... and I miss him so bad it hurts. And I guess I've made enough foolishness in my life that I don't deserve to have him at all. :-( This is turning out to be my most emotional post ever. I guess it's because I need a wake-up call. I will try to have a contemplative weekend... This time my Sundays are free- I've given up Sunday TKD classes because it's the most sensible thing to do. It's hard but it's God's way of letting me keep doing the one thing that I have passion for without me compromising the values that my parents brought me up to live by... I'm so confused about my life. Oh well. My constant busy-ness has given me an excuse not to think about what I really ought to be doing. I just wish I can still go back to the right path. :-(

      Oh my... am sleepy. :-p  I just realized that I wanted to be swallowed alive - big, humiliating booboo... in any case, read through my apology letter and ull get what I mean... --- Msevilla wrote "william_bustamante@yahoo.com":  Hi, sorry, I was just browsing through my old mail - I think I made a big, big mistake... my friend has the same name as urs, but I never really looked at his email add when I would reply to his mails.... and I never saved his addy - I just assumed that this is his email add... that's why I was quite taken aback when you were asking how I got ur add, I thought it was a big joke - i-deny daw ba na kakilala ako?! Like hello, we were good friends for a time, tapos biglang "he" asks me how I got his add... Turns out the big joke is on me because I have been forwarding so much (many of them personal!) to someone I don't know. oh my. Sana lamunin na ako ng lupa! It's only now that I took the time to look at his email add - it's nowhere near urs.   I'm soooo sorry!!!  I just realized I must have been jamming your inbox (at least before yahoo gave us 100MB) with my pix and all. And I never asked my friend if he got my pix and messages.... gawd, u must have thought I was stalking you. Again, I'm soooooo sorry and humiliated! ---- and take this, William (the guy I thought I was forwarding my pictures and emails to) was my recent ex (now friend na lang)... so you can just imagine that most of them were personal! Gawd, alam niya na mga nangyayari sa buhay ko...  Anyway, arrived 11pm last night already... as usual, heavier than usual uli ung training, pero enjoy pa rin ako... tapos kwentuhan pa with homies about the bands and songs of our highschool days - siakol (hehe), grin department, teeth, eheads, river maya (214! Bring me down), after Image, 4x4 (Sa Isip Ko... super mushy pero I love this song!) hehe... and songs like Princesa (luv this song!), CTG (what's the title?, goes like CTG kita Miss Miss Pakipot, CTG kita Miss Miss Suplada hehe I remember this kc this was sung to me by a crazed admirer yuck hehe), Lakas Tama (hehe)... Sabay kanta pa yun... kaya antok ako ngayon... hehe... TGIF... Gotta get to work now... Need something to wake me up...

      I'm about to go home now. For some divine intervention, my workload manages to ease just when I begin to think that I'm in for a crazy week. :-) I never have been absent from my TKD class yet despite my work. :-) Anyways, we're training quite hard recently. Last night I got home nearly 11pm already. Dead tired, and the moment I laid my head back, I fell instantly asleep. Thank God. I've always had a difficult time sleeping. Perhaps because I think about stuff too much. Or sometimes, because I try to block so many things from my mind that my conscience keeps knocking on my subconscious that I can't keep my mind from wandering and staying active till late. And in the day I'm sometimes I feel like a walking Zombie. But for some weird reason, my soul comes alive when I do TKD. Perhaps because that's the only time I lose myself in the process of focusing on the sport. I don't know.  Yesterday we had a self-defense portion in class. It was funny because I know my punches are not strong, but somehow I knocked the jaw of my partner, Sir Don. And since I was so used to being paired with a girl, I instinctively hugged him to say sorry. He could hardly speak because of the pain. Then came the time to break the shin bone. I lost control again and kicked too hard that he fell... Argh. Control!!! It was fun and I couldn't stop apologizing. Oh well, guess I gotta go now. For a change I'm gonna be home early. :-) Need to do some laundry (yesterday's uniform that I was too tired to even hang to dry)... Sleepy too. Back tomorrow. :-)

      by the way, i just had to share this... our instructor told me i'm getting better at my kicks. I kick hard and fast now. :-) I guess without the distraction I'm able to focus better.;-) I'm so happy!!! Just thinking about it brings a smile on my face. :-) I enjoy every minute of our training, I love feeling my sweat trickle down my body. Masochistic tendencies showing. haha.   My best friend has a new boyfriend now. Oh well, she left me in the lonely hearts club again. I just had to smile when she told me that she's trying to adjust from her being me, myself and I mode now that she has a serious boyfriend. I think that I myself am never going to outgrow that stage. Scary thought. :-p

      had a pretty quiet weekend. :-) at least quiet by my standards! haha... it's the first time I did not attend Rockwell class. It's a big adjustment on my part because having TKD class in every Sunday has been a big part of my lifestyle these past 9-10 months. Sadly, I really must let go of it. It's actually a blessing in disguise. But I've just been damn too stubborn to follow what I should do these past weeks coz I've still been attending that class even when everyone was telling me to quit. :-( Anyways, I hope I'll be able to make myself not go next week again.  On the other hand, it's not really much of a loss on my part because the biggest reason why I'm attending that class is gone. Gone back to London, that is! This is crazy... I never knew I'd be this hung-up on him. Oh my, but seeing his pictures on billboards soon would make it even harder to move on. Sucks. :-p Oh well now to more of my activities. I'm aching all over! I thought I'd make it well in the body combat class given that we're going through heavy training in TKD. But no, I woke up last Sat with an aching back and sore arms. But of course, I didn't miss TKD prax that night. :-) We praxd till 10.15 or so, so I got home around 11 already. Up to now I still have body pains, but I don't really mind. everybody says I'm a masochist. Guess it's true. haha. Oh well, now I have to face this big project (not that big really, just complicated)... well I have to convince myself to face this new week with my chin up. Life is, and will always be, beautiful. :-)

      Just joined a body combat class at fitness first. confident as I am of my endurance due to our TKD training, i still feel exhausted! it was fun and exciting, and very active but having tried a full contact sport, I still yearn for sparring and stuff. Must be the violent side of me.  Now we're off to watch Spiderman. I think I'll sleep through it hehe I'm hungry already. gotta go! TGIF!  I miss someone so much it hurts! hehehe drama!!

      had a fun but tiring night last night. went home at 10.30 already, training extended up to 10.10. It was crazy, we were doing duck walks and frog jumps up the stairs from bodypoint to the basement in Makati Square. People were staring at us - dobok-clothed aspirants who were already all sweaty and laughing at the same time. We also did a jump thingy over one another - there were 20 of us in reverse fetal position with our heads and bodies down the floor. It was harder to jump over our taller and broader-bodied guys because it was like jumping over a cow haha. then we also did military crawl under the same people. we were on our knees and our teammates crawled under us and we did likewise. i dunno how i managed to crawl quite fast - but i seem to kind of forgot about using my left leg. i dragged my whole body using my right arm and leg. weird because when it comes to kicking i kick harder with my left. We did a lot of kickings after our 7.30-9 session (Philippine team daw hehe). By the time it was sparring session we were already so tired but still fought like there was no tomorrow. haha.  i got home nearly 11pm and I and my homies still talked about stuff - childhood games. it was crazy because we had different names for the same games - geographic location being a big factor and all. we were laughing so hard and didn't care that we needed to wake up early today... jeez i am sleepy. then went to mass this am. actually nearly flew from Ayala to Aguirre street because my officemate informed me that I just had to see the priest. Cute guy, but I think my first ex would've looked better if he had enough money to buy some decent clothes. :-p he's cute enough though and it's his birthday today. The priest, I mean. :-p Now I gotta get back to work coz I'm watching spiderman2 tonight.
