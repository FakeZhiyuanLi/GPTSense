      The other night Vanessa and I had the most interesting and loonggestt conversation...partially (well probably completely) due to the taking of certain illegal substances earlier on lol... But anyway, back to the point, people really are so interesting. You can pick apart any person, their characteristics, attitudes, traits, ideals, theories, and figure out who they really are, behind the persona theyre trying to prove and the filters of their personalities, so long as you take the time to listen to them and get to know them. Vanessa and I, unbitchily lol, were able to take a look at some of the people we know, and were able to make connections through the things they do or say to the people they really are, and unnecessarily hide. Obviously, Vanessa and I are not exempt to this, because everyone hides certain parts of their personalities for some reason or another. But overall, we are both very apt to opening up and letting people know who we really are, so long as they want to hear it. Matt (Byford) once told me that I open up too easily, and that its probably my biggest personal downfall... but i thought about that and have a completely different perspective on the topic. The fact that I do open up, and do let people know who I really am isnt necessarily a downfall, so long as i dont care. People feel like they give themselves away when they open themselves up and then are betrayed or even just lose touch with the person they opened up to, but if you open up and dont care that people know who you are, you never lose anything. You shouldn't have to feel like you're losing a part of yourself, because really you are just adding to the acceptance of yourself.... its all really hard to explain and i've probably lost anyone reading this.. but yeah.

      So here is my first and final attempt at making and obtaining a website all about ME! woohoo eh? Im sure you'll be interested to know that my only hobbies aren't shopping, dying my hair, and talking about guys (oh in addition to being a bitch and more recently even a lesbian!! *sarcasm). I figured I'd open myself up to everyone, so that everyone could know that i am a real person, and i have feelings and theories just like everyone else. This will be about the only time that I address anyone reading this...btw: if u are a family member or close to the parents, u might not want to read this :) (u cant use it against me!) lol.
