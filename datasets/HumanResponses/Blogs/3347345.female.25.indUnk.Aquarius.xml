      I must be the only person who has no plans for on Memorial Day weekend. My family doesn't celebrate holidays, Mike's in Switzerland (lucky duck), and my friends are scattered & few. There *are* errands I can't really put off this weekend. I have to go to Chinatown to pick up my contact lens prescription. They refuse to give out my prescription to the callers at VisionDirect. Dammit! So I have to pick up a paper copy, then fax it to VisionDirect.   I'm in a bad mood. I've been looking like shit lately. When I look at myself, it's either with sinking disappointment or heavy-hearted acceptance. I wish I could go into hiding. The call of work is really the only thing that takes me out my room.

      Today at work there was a newspaper photo of a frog appearing to *hug* a fish. I want to repost it here but I can't find it online so just imagine all the frog's legs wrapped snugly around the fish's body. At first glance it looks predatory but then you realize that's not likely. It looks more like they're embracing or tussling. This photo was in a Chinese paper so I showed it to my Chinese coworker, W, & asked what the caption said. This is what she told me:  W: How do you say? It has 4 legs, it's green & makes sounds like "GwAK! GwAk!" (i'm having a hard time placing that noise with any animal) Me: A frog? W: Yes! A frog hugged a fish. Me: I see... Why? (she reads the caption again) W: Oh, okay. Frog farmers found a frog hugging a fish. So they separated them.

      I was working on a full fledged review of the Eldridge Street Isaac Bashevic Singer tribute but it was taking me too long to put together. I don't feel equipped to write about it since I missed the first hour (almost half the program). Instead, here are some Singer tidbits I learned that day.  I.B. Singer Fun Facts 1.Singer in some ways enjoyed writing more for children more adults. He liked their uninformed approach and honest responses. Still, he had a strained relationship with his son for most of his life. 2. He tried to understand and reconcile his Jewish identity through writing. 3. He couldn't stand the staff at The Forward in which he published heavily while living in New York. 4. He was once a guest on the Dick Cavesh Show. 5. His favorite authors were Kafka, the Russians and... Jack London. 6. He was annoyed when his editor at The New Yorker rejected 2 or 3 stories. One was called something like "The Golden Toilet Seat."  A 5 day I.B. Singer conference in Amherst is coming up. I planned on attending until I saw the cost: $795 not including accomodations.

      I started smoking again. I had 2 at work and 2 in the evening. I've been anxious lately about a number of changes. My habit kicked in again on Sat. night when my boyfriend Mike & I ran into R, an old friend/hookup of Mike's & a woman he admits was his sexual ideal. I was grinding my teeth when I realized who she was & during much of the improv show where we met. After chatting w/ her, though, I fell under her subtle charms & started to enjoy her company. Her bustiness, voice & slight grunginess all threw me off. I was expecting a well groomed pixie (based on a photo). It's not meeting her that makes me anxious or unhappy; it's the triggering of what Mike admitted: that she was his physical ideal. I suspect that she still is, even though he denies it.   Work was unbearable today. I told my boss I would accept a title change if it came w/ a raise. It's not a promotion so I wasn't jumping at the chance exactly. I don't think I can stay there another week w/o abusing my poor coworkers.

      I want to get into a practice of writing every day. I haven't written for pleasure in YEARS. When I try, it's forced & brief. Very discouraging. Longer & longer intervals between writing. Lately I've been afraid I've outgrown writing, like when prodigies grow up & have to lose their gifts. The last time I really valued & enjoyed writing enough to place it above anything else was in high school. It used to really make me giddy... if that sounds like a relationship, it probably was, since I didn't have a romance until junior year. Maybe I can't write well if I'm in a relationship.   I wasn't going to share this blog with anyone I know, not even my boyfriend who knows the most about me. If I'm going to be candid, I'm also going to hurt/gross-out/offen d/scare people who know me. Strangers--I don't care what they think. I have the most disjointed identity... I can't tell if I'm being stingy & enigmatic or that I sense people won't accept me if they know me more holistically. I do know that I'm unhappy about it.
