      Last night, we went to the D.I. 'wrap' party.  It was fun.  The kids were outside a good deal of the time, screaming and running around and we so called grown ups were inside chatting up a storm.  Our pizza order wasn't put through when we called it in the first time, so 45 minutes after ordering it, we called again (only because many munchkins were running in asking for food and filling up on chip - plus a few grapes and strawberries).  We got a discount and the order was put in again.  That time, it actually arrived!  So, we ate and laughed and talked about our kids' performances in their skit.  And sighed that they are now on Spring Break for a week - lol.    R had a major tumble off her bike yesterday morning, as J was taking her to school.  She tore her pants at the knee and ended up with a very bad cut on her knee.  She was really upset about her pants because it was Career Day and she was dressed in her 'Secret Agent' outfit, which closely resembles the outfit on the Barbie Secret Agent CD ROM.  I had also printed a badge from Microsoft Word and laminated it.  It was a government looking badge.  I wrote "U.S. Government   Agent" (with her name here) and pinned it to her shirt.  She looked pretty cute and I ended up running a similar pair of pants up to school for her.  But it was a bad cut.  She was not a happy camper when we gave her a bath last night.  It was late, she was tired and her knee stung in the water, so it wasn't a good time.  But, she's feeling better today after a good night's sleep.  No swimming lessons today, though.    I'm looking forward to a peaceful, quiet day.  And it was nice to sleep in this morning - until 8:00a.m.!  That is a rare treat.    You know, I never mentioned that I changed my hair color last week.  I was born a redhead, but in my late 20's and early 30's, my hair started getting darker and darker.  I decided to highlight it blond and stuck with that for about 13 years.  The natural color had gone from really red when I was little to strawberry blond as a teen and in my 20's.  Toward the end of my 20's, it turned to auburn and finally to a brown with red highlights.  I didn't like it that dark at all, so I started the blond highlights.  I loved being a blond, but thought it would be fun to make a big change.  So I went back to the red.  It's highlighted red to give the strawberry blond effect.  Of course, it's not as nice as the real thing - what it looked like when I was young - but it's pretty nice and I'm really loving it.  J keeps teasing me about being with another woman now who happens to be a redhead - lol.  My hairdresser said her husband told his friends he never knows who he'll be coming home to - lol.  Well, I keep getting interrupted here, so I'll have to take this up again later.  Peace.

      R came home from school early this week with strep throat, slept in bed with me and breathed on me, cried on me, probably wiped a little snot on me.  The result?  I'm not feeling well today, darn it.  Headache, a little body achy, a sore throat just beginning.  Can't go into the Dr. too soon, or nothing will show up.  But I usually get a sinus infection with this stuff.  Oh, well.  Next week is Spring Break, so I'll be able to nap a bit here and there.  We'll go to the library, the museum and maybe the zoo.  Have to see how much I can handle.  After all, what's Spring Break without a little fun.  Oh, maybe a nice mountain trip, too!  We love those!  And, of course, R will have her best friend, S, over for at least 2 play dates!  I'm sure we'll have someone else over, too, if we have time.    Tonight, we go to a little 'wrap' party for the D.I. group.  I'm making a cake (which I will not breathe on!) and set everything up.  They'll have pizza, cake and ice cream, juice or soda (R doesn't like soda and I'm thankful for that) and they'll play together without having to focus on the skit.  I picked up some little '#1' buttons for them.  We had already given then some real medallion awards.  They all think it came from D.I., and that's fine, because at this age, thinking you didn't win something is a bit of a bummer.  And they worked so hard on it.  Anyway, I'm not a great cake maker - in fact, I only starting baking successful cakes about 4 years ago.  Before that, they always sunk in the center - lol.  Don't know what I did wrong!  I'm just going to put 'D.I. 2004' on the cake with some gold stars I picked up.  The school colors are gold and black, so I got gold (yellow) for writing, white icing and then a chocolate cake.    I'm feeling much better about the incident with N's mom, but I've had a bit of a wake up call about her.  Just two days ago, she told a little white lie about a Brownie outing, too.  I guess I just don't understand that.  Especially when there doesn't seem to be any point in it.  My mother is like that.  Just little white lies all over the place.  It's impossible to figure out why.  I guess it's just habit.  And, obviously, a pet peeve of mine.    Got my icky female yearly stuff done, finally.  But it was good to see my gyn Dr. because we are friends.  She's funny and we laugh the whole time, so it makes the whole experience better, if that's possible.  She always asks how R is doing and tells me to give her a kiss and a hug from her.  Afterall, she was the first to hold my daughter when she came into the world.  I still remember that moment, when I first saw her, as if it were yesterday.  And I will never forget the moment they pulled her out and J saw her before me.  He burst into tears, overjoyed that this little being was a part of him.  Of us.  What an amazing joy children are.  What an extraordinary gift from God.  I am so grateful for my daughter.    A couple of days ago, I found out our best friends (couples friends) are moving next summer (not this summer) to Texas.  K has a sister that lives there.  I'm really bummed about this because we get together with them all the time, usually 2-3 times a month.  So it brought up discussion between J and I about moving to Idaho again.  My best friend since I was a kid, L, is thinking about a move out of state, too.  It's so expensive to live here, the houses being outrageous for the income you can make.  So I looked at some houses on the internet.  Oh my gosh!!!  They are so beautiful and for soooooo much less than what they would be here!  And we love Idaho.  Plus, the school J attends has a location in Boise.  So, now we are thinking of setting a goal to move there by next summer.  His best friend moved to WI some time ago and we do have family here, but not close by that we see regularly.  I think my biggest regret would be leaving R's best friend S (whose parents have also talked about moving back to CA) and this school district which is in the top 3 in the Nation.  Also, my brother, K, whom R is really, really close to.  But, again, we only see him 2-4 times a year and he loves that area, so maybe he'd come visit.   Anyway, we could offer so much more to her in activities, a yard to play in (we live in a townhouse now, with about 160 square feet of dirt for a yard out back), a swingset, trampoline, the money to take nice vacations, etc.  It would be a much better situation for us in that respect.  I'd never have my dream home here.  So, we are thinking, planning, checking things out.  I've been drinking some Celestial Seasonings Throat Soothers tea.  It's amazing how well it works.  If only it lasted all day.  And helped with the other aches.  It's amazing tea, though.  Sometimes a nice cup of tea in a pretty little teacup or a favorite mug really is soothing.  Try it sometime, if you haven't already.  Well, I'm worn down.  I'm going to catch a short nap, then get busy baking that cake for tonight.  Peace.

      I haven't posted in a few days because we've been so busy around here.  R had her Destination Imagination (D.I.) competition on Saturday.  They'd done a run-through at school on Wednesday in front of the whole school, but with microphones.  Well, what do you think happened when you put a few hams on a stage and gave them mics?  Giggles, loud stage 'whispers' right into the mic, trying to get around cords that were attached to the mics.  It was less than graceful, but they got through it.  R and another girl, L, were the leads in the skit because they are the biggest hams.  :)  Neither knows the meaning of stage fright.  But on the day of the competition, R's costume was damaged.  Her tail broke and they couldn't fix it (they were caticorns - creatures they created).  Being dramatic (and probably somewhat related to being an only child) she had a little breakdown.  But, the other kids helped calm her and she realized she could just go on.  Then the two girls playing the part of the magical centipede got into a bit of a fistfight!  lol.  That, however, was also resolved and the play went on.  The judges scored hard and we got a 64 , I think it was, out of 100.  However, most of the kids' groups scored low, 70 being the highest that we knew of.  The idea was to give kids a chance to improve, rather than scoring them so high they didn't feel like they needed to work harder next year.  So, all in all, we were happy with the results.  It was exhausting, though, so I'm glad it's over until next year.  Now things will be a little more peaceful.  J is finally well after having struggled with losing his voice and awful coughs for a good 6 months.  He saw an ENT and they scoped his throat.  He'd had a rupture in his vocal cords!  It's almost healed now, though.  I'm sure it was because of how hard he was coughing.  Next visit, I go with him so we can address the allergies that cause the coughing in the first place.  Men!  He never even mentioned it to the Dr.!  lol.  His new semester at school has begun this week.  He loves his Tues. night professor, who is teaching the math, because he explains it all well.  His previous math teacher didn't.  However, he has a professor he total thinks is inadequate teaching his Thursday night and Saturday morning classes because she doesn't teach well.  Apparently, the entire class is in agreement with him, too.  He was pretty bummed out for a few days, which is hard on R and I because we are the ones he takes it out on.  Anyone who has dealt with a loved one with depression will understand what I'm talking about.  Thankfully, though, he pulled himself together yesterday, so we are not heading any further down that awful path.    R. is home sick again!  I can't believe it because I just got her well.  The school nurse called yesterday around 11 a.m. and said she had a headache, tummy and leg aches (the legs, I think, are the same growing pains I had as a kid, from being tall and growing fast) and her throat hurt.  The nurse said her tonsils were swollen and she suspected strep.  Well, she's on antibiotics today, and just in time, too.  Her left ear had started hurting while we were filling the prescription last night.  She's a bit fussy today - quick to have a  crying breakdown and a good indication she's not feeling well - but I think she does feel a little better today.  Hopefully, she'll be back at school tomorrow.  They are on spring break next week and she missed 3 days with the last illness.  I know it's not as big a deal to miss school in 1st grade, but she doesn't like to miss it and I don't want her to miss out on anything fun or interesting at school, either.  Nor to decide it's okay to miss school unless you must.      I've been exercising regularly again.  It's been a long time since I've done that.  I picked up a DVD set of Leslie Sansone's Walk Away The Pounds Express.  I've been doing the 2 mile brisk walk workout.  I really love to walk, but find it hard to go outside and walk around the park or whatever, so these DVD's are great.  This is one of those things I mentioned being fat steals from me.  I love to walk, but I'm too insecure to walk outside.  What if someone hears me breathing hard?  What if someone makes a comment about how fat I am?  What if someone looks at me and sees I'm sweating?  To most people, these are stupid concerns, but to me, they are major concerns.  Yep, it's lack of self esteem.  But I know 60 pounds from now, my self esteem, while not perfect, will have improved greatly.  And 100 pounds from now, I will feel like a new person, just fighting off the last leg of my weight loss.  Altogether, I have approximately 140 pounds to lose, unless I decide to drop my goal weight another 5 pounds, which I've often considered likely.  That's a whole person.  And it's that person, the one I'll be losing, who will be the one that needs work on her self esteem, who isn't comfortable in crowds, who worries about people looking at her.  As if not having anyone looking at her makes her smaller.  What's left after that 140 pound person is gone, will be me.  And a better model - both physically and emotionally - than her.  What I'm saying is, I'm working on the emotional aspect along with losing the weight.  And by the time I am at my goal weight, I think my heart and my mind will be different, too.  I will end up being a happier, healthier person than I am today.     My eating has been good for a number of days.  But two days I didn't eat well.  After seeing a 4 pound loss on Sunday, I'll be lucky not to see a gain with those two days of bad eating, even with eating well the rest of this week (and exercising, of course).  But I'm going to pursue this and make this change.  I've had enough of not feeling comfortable in my own skin (and fat).  time to rid myself of what holds me back.....my weight.    My husband, J, bought me a used bike a few months ago.  It's one that you don't have to worry about the gears - they change automatically.  I'd found it hard to ride and change my gears before, so he thought this would be good for me.  Then we got a new gel seat for it and he did some clean up/maintenence on it.  On Friday, we rode the bikes to pick up R from school.  He'd ridden with her that morning, so her bike was locked up at school.  Well, I have to admit that by the time I got home, I was shaking!  First, I was nervous as I hadn't ridden since I got pregnant with R 8 years ago.  Then, it worked muscles (and apparently worked them harder) that I had worked them for a while, I guess.  It was fun, but I was exhausted...in a good way!  J is going to raise my seat a little because he thinks part of it was having to peddle with my knees coming up so high.  But I think mostly it was from peddling all this weight around!  It was fun, though, and I'm going to keep at it as each days' schedule permits.  That should be most days.  Even though it's March here, we've been having record highs (which I do not like the hot weather at all, you may recall!).  It's been in the 70's and even hit the 80's a couple of days.  Too hot!  But good weather for riding bikes.  I guess you can't have it all.    Well, I've cleaned up my house (some of it, anyway), organized some stuff, got R busy on her computer until I think she needs a rest and I now need to get busy on school work.  I really should have - really, really should have - been done by now.  Of course, this brings up one more thing.......J and I talked and decided part time work would be enough.  I've had such a hard time keeping up everything and R always has so much going on that I just felt I'd never be able to do it.  So, we talked, he obviously noticed, and we decided I should go part time.  I feel much better about the whole thing now.  But I won't end up working for the people I interviewed with earlier.  They are looking for full time, only.  J helped me start to set up an account on Monster.com, though, and there seem to be plenty of jobs in this field that do allow part time.  So, I'm not worried.  Something will come up.  Okay, off to start my school work.  I'm so close to being done, I can taste the joy of completion and success!!!!  lol.   That will bring peace........

      Well, for two days now, I've eaten healthy and exercised!  I'm feeling better  for it, of course.  It's a good feeling to fill your body on healthy things - veggies, fruit, whole wheat, lean meat and low fat on anything else you eat.  And I can feel my body thanking me already.  This is so very much what I needed to do for myself.  And any time I eat healthy for a couple of days - long enough for my body to feel better because of it - I wonder why the heck I don't eat this way all the time!  And now I'm going to continue to pursue this and do right by myself.  After all, if we can love others in such a selfless manner as a mother loves her child/ren, there is no reason we can't love ourselves well enough to do what we need to for ourselves.  And it sets a good example for R.  She'll follow my lead on this, I hope.    This parenting thing can be so heart-wrenching sometimes.  You never realize, until you hold your child for the first time, how very deep and overwhelming the love you feel for them will be.  You don't realize beforehand that you are going to fall completely in love with them.  You don't realize how your heart will be forever intertwined with theirs.  It is a very powerful feeling.  Overwhelming.  Deperate, even, at times.    Now, maybe because I'm in the middle of my cycle right now and maybe just because of that powerful, intertwined love I have for R, my heart was broken  today.  To start at the beginning, in kindergarten, a group of kids that included R all became friends.  They played together after school, had play dates and hung out together.  And, of course, any time there is a group of people - kids or adults - there are a number of dynamics you must work within.  Two girls in the group became best friends.  Even in the end of the year picture I took of all of them lined up together, you can see some friction when R and one of the girls, N, have their heads together in the pose.  The 3rd girl, A, and the best friend of N, is looking very upset in the picture.  We even took another one, but still the same face.  It was clear she was not wanting to share her best friend.  And that's okay.  It's hard to share a best friend when you're no older than 5 or 6, too.  This year, they were all in different classes - R with one of the boys still in her class, N in another, etc.  But N and A have remained best friends.  This year, they haven't eliminated R from them, but it's clear there are the two of them and then R.  In fact, N & A pretty much play together with R as a third wheel, but N always seemed to include her still.  When the boys are around, they do get them to chase them - lol.  Well, today I had found out that N had her birthday party on Saturday and, as you can probably guess, didn't invite R.  It was a sleepover.  R had a sleepover for her last birthday, too.  Both N and A were invited and N stayed the night, but A didn't - her mom saying A's dad didn't want to allow sleepovers yet.  And that's okay, too.  It's different for everyone.  But I was hurt that N didn't invite R.  Hurt for R.  Because R is a kid who loves everyone.  She wants to be friends with everyone.  She wants to be kind and be treated kindly back.  She's a really good kid who tries hard to meet other kid's expectations.  Of course N has every right not to invite her.  And they don't get together on play dates anymore (because they're in school full time and it's next to impossible to arrange).  But they do play some together after school, when N stays.  Mostly as a group of kids.  Well, I didn't find out about the party from N's mom.  I found out from another mom who has a son from the original group.  Of course, she didn't expect her son to be invited since it was a sleepover.  Anyway, I really was worried that something had happened between N and R and that R just hadn't told me about it.  I guess I didn't expect her to be left out since they do still play together some and they are in Brownies together.  So, I thought, "Yeah, something must have happened between them and I should find out about it so I can talk to R if she's done something wrong.  I couldn't ask R.  That would alert her to the fact she wasn't invited to this party.  So, I finally decided to call N's mom.  I figured she's a friend, so she'd want to talk about it, too.  But that's not how things really went.  When I called, I mentioned I didn't want to upset her, but I had heard about the party and was worried that something had happened between the girls that I didn't know about.  She was really quite nasty at first, saying, "Yes.  N had a party and I'm sorry if it offended you, but she didn't want to invite R."  Well, what was I to think of that?  Something's happened.  R's done something wrong.  Which was what I was trying to find out.  So I said I wasn't offended (although I am hurt about the whole thing, including the mom conversation after - or more to the point, because of how the mom conversation started, which I think shows more the truth in how things are).  I said that I was just worried something had happened between them that I needed to talk to R about.  Then she seemed to calm down a bit and said no, nothing had happened, they just hadn't been playing together and N only got to invite 4 kids, A being one of them since they are best friends, of course, and 2 from class and one from outside of school.  So, I said okay, again that I just wanted to make sure R hadn't done something to upset them, etc.  We ended the converstation.  I went to school to pick up R when it was time and was talking to the same mom who'd told me about the party.  Now, she and I are good friends, so we talk about anything.  N & A's moms are good friends, too.  They hang out together and have boys about the same age.  When A's mom came, we were still blabbing and she mentioned she'd just gotten off the phone with N's mom.  I had only talked to N's mom about 30 minutes before time to get the kids, so I half joking, half worried that N's mom was upset with me for talking about the whole situation, said, "Oh, did she call to tell you I'd called about the b-day party?" and sort of laughed.  Now the weird part was A's mom responded with tension and said something like, "Wha....no, I don't know what you're talking about."  But it was obvious she did.  That just made the whole thing worse for me.  Now I know I've upset her, no matter what face she puts on and that will possibly pass on down to R through their girls.  And I feel like I've failed R over all this.  But I also feel really upset that they both likely lied to me.  And I've done my share of lying in my life, but I long ago figured out that it's much more harmful to lie to people than to just be honest, even if you think it might be hurtful to them.  If N's mom had just said something beforehand, like, "I'm sorry, but since N and R haven't played together much and N's limited in the # of kids she can invite, she isn't inviting R to her sleepover."  I'd have understood that.  I'd have asked then if something had happened and then been fine.  Instead, I got dishonestly and that makes me feel like I can't trust them.  The bad part is that they are both co-leaders of her Brownie troop.  And her leader isn't a very affectionate person with any of the girls, so I'd hoped to move R to the troop N & A's mom's were going to start next year.  Now I don't know what to do.    On the way home from school, I talked to R about keeping in mind who she plays with at school - during recess and before and after school - for setting up play dates this summer and then when her b-day comes around next time.  I reminded her that sometimes we change our friends as we grow up and meet more people to be our friends.  I never mentioned any of the above, of course.  But as she talked about who she played with and who she'd want at her next party, she mentioned N & A.  I said, "Well, you don't really play with them much anymore, do you?  Just once in a while?"  She said, "Yeah, but I'd want to invite them just to be nice."  That ripped my heart out and made me angry that she could have been hurt - and may still be if and when it comes out that N didn't invite her.  And now I don't know what to think about the whole thing.  I just told R she didn't have to do that and should just think about the people she played with everyday because she'd be limited in how many she could have at a party and I couldn't have 40 kids over here this summer.   Okay, and am I an idiot?  Are there other 'friends' of hers that don't really want to be her friends?  Do they judge her based on me and they don't like me?  Do parents judge allowing their kids to be friends with R because of her dad's illness?  It makes me wish I'd never spoken to anyone.  Maybe I shouldn't have raised her to be so open hearted?  Is she going to have her heart broken all the time over friends that really don't want to be friends?  All sorts of things running through my head.  And I just hurt for her because the awful truth is that I will not be able to protect her from all this stuff.  And she's such a great kid, so loving and kindhearted.  It just breaks my heart.    I never expected anything like this - to hurt for my baby because I can't protect her from this stuff and to see these two people whom I thought had the same values in honesty that I do seem not to be so honest.  I'll be glad when I can get this out of my mind and stop being so upset about it.  In the end, R will probably just not think a lot about it. But it sure is  making mom's heart ache.

      It seems like this week went by me really quickly.  Maybe because R was sick all week and I don't feel like I've accomplished much.  Or maybe just because we've been so busy.  Life's like that sometimes, I guess.  On Friday, while R and her dad were at the dance, I enjoyed the quiet and just relaxed.  But the dance was only supposed to last until 9 p.m.  However, by 10 p.m., they still weren't home.  Now, most people wouldn't think much about that.  They'd figure dad and daughter were just having a good time and stopped for a treat or something.  But, because of past history with my husband's depression and some previous behavior (several years ago, that I'll get to), I began to really worry at 10 p.m.  By 10:30 p.m., I was frantic.  I was praying for R's safety, praying J hadn't had a relapse with his depression, passed out or had a heart attack.  But I also was angry that J hadn't taken his cell phone and wondered if that wasn't intentional, a repeat behavior from several years ago.    Depression is a terrible disease - both for the person suffering from it and for those around them whom he or she loves and who loves them.  Anyone who has dealt with a loved one who suffers from this disease will understand what I'm talking about.  The depressed person doesn't want to own what they do.  Instead, they take everything out on the people around them, feeling justified in what they do.  It's always someone elses fault - how they feel, how things go in their lives, their moods.  Because of these behaviors, and typically their refusal to discuss anything (prefering to just shut themselves off), loved ones find themselves targets and feel the depressed person is always angry with them.  You can't get it right, no matter what you do.  And that's a tough way to live.  Before J's medication was correct and he wasn't with the right therapist, things had deteriorated badly between us.  I felt constantly attacked and, the truth was, he was constantly attacking.  Our future together was very much a long shot back then.    In this other incident a couple of years ago, he had gone to pick R up from an activity and didn't bring her back home for almost 3 hours.  He had intentionally left his cell phone at home.  My parents were visiting at the time and I was frantic and trying not to show them how worried I was.  Of course, he'd done this intentionally because he was angry.  Probably partially about having my parents visiting and that attention was going elsewhere instead of to him.  I don't remember if there was another, specific issue he was angry about because back then, it seemed everything was an unspoken, hidden anger he had about one thing or another and it was always directed at me.  A depressive often takes everything out on their spouses or other family members, refusing to accept responsibility for their own feelings or actions.  Of course, he eventually came home, smug about the whole thing and acting like I was foolish to have been so upset and worried.  But there was a smirk on his face and he knew full well what he'd done and was happy with himself.  Anyway, back to Friday night.  About 10:40 p.m., he called collect from a pay phone to say they were on their way home.  The music had been too loud at the dance and they'd only stayed about an hour.  Then they'd gone to an arcade and then to a bowling alley and they'd just finished their game.  I was still angry, though, because R had been sick and it was so late.  She had to be up relatively early the next day for her Destination Imagination practice and then swimming lessons.  Plus, there was smoking in the bowling alley, she is having trouble with her asthma and has been sick all week.  She was asleep when they got home, so I couldn't bathe her to get rid of the smoke smell.  She woke enough to tell me she'd had fun, though, and that it had been her decision to leave the dance.    Now, the part I felt bad about with all of this was that my husband has come a long, long way with his illness.  He's not suicidal (although I'd never have let him take Rachel somewhere alone if I'd thought he was - and you do come to recognize when they are not well), he's not in a depressive state, he's doing extremely well coping with life as a person without this illness would be able to do.  I should have had faith, in Heavenly Father and in him.  I shouldn't have worried.  But he's only really been well for about a year now.  Only really been on the correct medication for about a year, too.  And, although he was a bit upset with me, he understood why I was feeling the way I was.  A year or so ago, he would have made that into a serious crime on my part.  But, he took responsibility for what he's done in the past by accepting that it was normal for me to feel the way I did.  That I require time to learn to trust him, to believe that he will not relapse and our family begin to deteriorate again.  I am grateful to be in a relationship with him now that allows me my emotions without serious consequences (as long as they are normal and not excessive, of course).  That's something I didn't have for a long time in my marriage.  And it's a good feeling to know it's okay to feel however it is I'm feeling and that I don't have to hide it.  So, this beast called depression can't have us.  It can't have our family.  It can't have him.  As long as we work hard at our marriage and family, and he keeps working so hard on himself, we'll survive this beast and be better for it.

      Ahhhh, March.  It's the month I do all those unpleasant, embarrassing yearly exam things.  Yesterday morning was the mammogram.  Just how flat can they make these things go, for Pete's sake?!?!?!  But, ya know, it's just one of those things you really have to do.  So, I did it and I'm really, really, really glad it's over for another year.    My baby girl has been sick most of the week, too.  Poor kid only made it back to school on Thursday and then couldn't finish yesterday or today - she was just too exhausted from coughing and being achy.  But she was only 1/2 an hour from managing the entire school day both days.  We knew she'd had it, though, because usually she stays after school to play with pals while we mom's all chat.  She was very willing to give that up and just come home and lay down for a little while.  Mostly, it's a cold that has aggravated her asthma.  But I give her a rest of half an hour and she's ready to go again.  In fact, tonight, she and Daddy are off to a Girl scouts sponsored Father/Daughter dance.  They looked so nice and she was so excited.  I think Daddy's going to enjoy it, too.  And Mom gets a nice, quiet evening alone.  But I miss them the whole time they are gone, too.  And worry if they aren't home when I think they should be.  Neurotric, I know.  Wish I could just be more calm about it all.  I actually had a lot to say when I first signed on here tonight, but I've had a bunch of interruptions, so I think I'll just stop and try again tomorrow.

      By the way, I finally got the comments on this page.  But, it's at the very top (above the blogspot ad at the top of the page).  Not where I meant for it to go, but at least it's on there now!  Be kind.

      I have known, and been best friends with, L for 29 years now.  We endured Jr. and Sr. high school together, marriages (hers at 19 the first time and then again just last year and mine at 33), children (hers - 1 in college and 1  nearly grown, mine but 7 years old), hitting 40 and growing older.  She is still my very best friend, the first person I think of when something in my life is tough and when things are at their best.  Aside from my husband, she knows more about me than anyone else on the face of the earth.  She stayed in the small town we grew up in.  The town I couldn't wait to escape.  She married a farmer the first time.  I sought something I couldn't find until I found myself.  Her life experiences differ dramatically from mine once we became adults.  And I love her like a sister.  My daughter calls her aunt and her kids have always called me aunt.  I'd do anything I could to help her if and when she needs me and she knows it.  She'd do the same for me.    We call each other around birthdays, holidays, summertime.  We don't get together that often though, just because life is busy.  But we have had times when many months have passed at a time without a call to each other.  Not out of anger or neglect, but just from the business of our own lives.  Recently, we've talked a lot on the phone.  This means that after the conversations of how things are going in our lives, the basics, we've move on to more detail - where we went to dinner, what we did with some other couples, etc.  During one of these conversations, she was telling me about a discussion that came up.  It was about terrorism and allowing foreigners into the country.  One of the men there was a Marine.  He brought it up and then said something to the effect of people from the middle east should not be allowed in the country right now.  L.'s next response to him surprised me.  She always seemed to be tolerant when we were in school, trying to get others to be kind to someone different.  If fact, that was partially what brought us together at the age of 13 - she stood up for 'the fat girl'.  But her response to this man was that our country shouldn't be letting any foreigners in at all.  She mentioned Mexican immigrants and said they took jobs from Americans.  I wondered where the heck she'd been living all these years.  I was really surprised.  Not being one to keep my mouth shut, though, I spoke right up.  I mentioned that not all middle eastern people are terrorists, nor do they all hate Americans.  I reminded her that my brother-in-law is from Iran.  That his mother comes to visit from Iran every year or two.  That she wouldn't see her grandchildren (a sister also lives in the U.S.) if she couldn't get a visa to come here.  I mentioned that I loved my brother-in-law and his mother very, very much.  I also mentioned that I hadn't seen any Americans, at least not in this State, picking crops from sun up until sun down and that many other 'hard labor' type jobs were routinely done by Mexican immigrants.  Why?  Because not a lot of Americans would do that kind of back breaking work.  Mexican immigrants don't take jobs from Americans - they either become Americans, if they enter legally or they do the work none of us wants to do.  Or both.  And then I remembered how sheltered a person is in a small community, especially one that has little to attract city people.  And I was grateful that I had been out in the rest of the world.    Now, to my dear friend's credit, simply having me bring these points to mind, she changed her opinion, having never thought about it before the way I presented it.  And it made me grateful for that word that I have come to consider a great one - tolerance.  No one has to agree with another's lifestyle, religious or political beliefs, behavior.  But we should try to understand, reach out to others, love them in spite of what they do, think or say and be a good example to them.    Okay, off my soapbox.  But, hey, it's my blog and I can say it if I want to - lol.    Two quotes that come to my mind today:  Character is the result of 2 things - mental attitude and the way we spend our time.    Elbert Hubbard  Reputation is what you are in the light; Character is what you are in the dark.  I don't know what my specific point was in today's post.  But keeping this blog has become very theraputic for me.

      I always think I'll find a day to relax, not run around all over the place or work on my school stuff or whatever.  Saturday always seems like such a nice day for that.  But it never seems to be for us.  I left the house at 9:30 this morning, dropped R off to work on her Destination Imagination stuff with her group and started running errands.  I picked R up at 11 or so and kept running errands with her in tow.  I finally walked in the door around 2:30 p.m., had a bunch of stuff to unload, put away, laundry, picking up the house, dishes from this morning, dinner to cook (which I never got to - we just grabbed something quick), (at this point I dropped and took a 1/2 hour nap on the sofa), R's bath, to bed and read a book, sing a song and then my shower, bills to write out and pay, a Sunday School lesson to prepare, clothes to iron for church tomorrow, laundry to fold and put away.  I haven't finished the last 4 yet.  But I will before I go to bed tonight.  I used to never *need* a nap during the day.  Now I need one a couple of days a week.  Not enough sleep?  Iron low?  No.  Not those.  Not really, anyway, although I could probably use a bit more sleep at night.  The real culprit is my weight.  My not all that healthy, filled with way too much garbage, eating.  It's time to stop this useless, foolish trend and get healthy again.  Now let me tell you, I've said this over and over and over throughout my life.  Sometimes, I've had great success, even for up to a year, maybe.  But then I always give up, creep back up in my weight.  The difference now is that I'm over 40 and it's become very uncomfortable to be this heavy.  My back, which I have chronic pain in anyway, really hurts.  My knees kill me if I do a lot of stairs or I do squats.  My heels hurt when I walk a lot.  My shoulders, likely related to my back being a mess, hurt.  My hips are stiff if I sit for more than 1/2 an hour.  I'm tired a lot, all the time.  My diabetes - oh,yeah, I've got that hanging over my head when I'm not taking care of myself - is not under control.  I'm breathless when I reach the top of my stairs.  And I'm sure there's more I'm not thinking of at the moment.  Now, a thin person would think, "What the heck, lady!  Stop eating!"  Someone who is also overweight would say, "I hear ya!"  Because being overweight isn't just about eating too much or the wrong things.  Oh yes, that's a big part of it and you have to learn about healthy eating and normal portions at the very beginning of the journey.  But you also have to figure out the emotional side, because that's the real demon in this journey.  I grew up being offered a bowl of ice cream every time I cried - because I'd been physically or emotionally hurt.  I don't think my mother knew what else to do.  That's the way she comforted herself - and still does to this day.  And the truth is, you do feel a certain level of comfort when you eat junk, have a binge or whatever your thing is.  It's after you're done eating it that the catch 22 begins.  The guilt seeps in.  The regret.  The bad feelings you want to make go away.  Oh, a bowl of ice cream ought to do it!, you say.  And that is the cycle.  Well, not so cut and dry, but similar to it.  So when I'm eating healthy and doing what I need to for myself, I have to face things most of us leave hidden deep inside.  I have to face it and deal with it appropriately.  That's not easy when you haven't learned those tools as a child.  And when you have a lifetime of that baggage, garbage, whatever you want to call it, you have a lot to work through.  But, it's possible and there are many people who have done so and kept their weight off.  One of my dearest friends, Bell, is a great example of exactly that.  And she's a great sorce of support to myself and others in the e-mail group we all belong to.  Support in this journey is something you simply must have - from someone in your life.  I'm grateful to have that with not just one, but two e-mail groups.  That's a great way to go for the support you need.  Anyway, I've set my sights on Monday as a day to begin working toward exercise and healthier eating.  Oh, yeah, that's another key.  You can change your eating habits without exercise, but you'll not see the same results - not as quickly, not a fitly as you could.  Notice I don't use the word 'diet', either.  Well, that's not what I want to do.  I don't want to diet.  I want to change my eating for life, learn to eat in normal portions and only because I'm hungry, not bored, upset, angry, etc.  I do use diet in my personal motto: Deprivation is diet suicide.  Maybe I should change it to 'healthy eating suicide' - lol.         I'm in the process of trying to figure out how to set up the comments part on here, but I'm a computer moron, so I'm struggling.  Trying to get some help with someone else that writes a blog and set hers up recently (Heather!  Help me!).  And as she said, I just hope everyone is kind because I'd say I'm not exactly a rock when it comes to people saying negative things to me.  :)

      We headed off to see Haunted Mansion at the dollar theater today.  R had been wanting to see it.  A friend's son, who is 11, was scared after seeing it.  But it seems nothing much scares R.....unless it's a true medical drama or something like that.  She's watched Jurassic Park, the Harry Potter movies, halloween week on Discovery or TLC channels with us and not been scared (at least not too scared - although the 2nd Harry Potter movie came close, but that was all about the snake, I think).  But put on a medical true story drama, like the Iranian twins conjoined at the tops of their heads, and she totally freaks out - nightmares and all!!  lol.  I actually think it's a good thing.  She understands the difference between reality and fantasy.  Truth and fiction.  I find my little 7 year old R very insightful.  Not that I'm partial or anything like that!  I liked the part in the movie with the singing quartet of busts.  And I now, finally, understand the toys McDonald's was giving out a while back of the singing head.    I've been doing a home school program for medical transcription for over a year.  It's probably possible to complete it in 6 months if you work hard.  I think the average is 8-10 months.  I am now going into my 14th month on it.  **Sigh**  I've totally taken this week off, too, even though I know it's important that I get this all done.  But the family time we've so rarely had these days called to me more than my school work.  I'll have to make up for lost time, now, working double time on it to finish up.  I'm only 3 lessons away from completion.  I'll be glad when I'm finished, employed and have been working for a few months at it.  J and I keep bringing up Idaho.  It's sooooo expensive to live in Colorado that we will likely never own a home with a yard.  Our current home is a townhouse we bought when we were first married and we've long ago outgrown it.  His schooling, which will lead him to a new employment field, opens some doors for us.  We love Colorado and the only other place we think we could ever be happy is Idaho - so much like here, minus the excessive cost of living and the growing traffic issues.  There's been a lot of rapid growth here and having been here all J's life and most of mine, it's hard to see it become so crowded, so many cars on the road, the fields we once looked upon now filled with row upon row of homes, practically right up against each other.  So, our thoughts have slipped to moving away from this home we have known for so long and the only home R has even known.  The positives far outweigh the negatives and we bring it up off and on to R in hopes that it will prepare her.  She's so sensitive and has wonderful friends here - her best friend having been that since they were 2 years old.  How do we know it will not set her back?  Change this amazing, outgoing (yet sensitive and sometimes shy), loving, happy child?  How do we know what is best if and when such an opportunity comes up?  I only keep telling J we must do this before she is in 4th grade, when she will need to prepare by gaining the support of friends made in grade school to cope with Jr. high or middle school.  But, if we don't move, what can we offer her here?  Streets that become more dangerous and clogged with traffic, the same house, overflowing to the gills, no yard of her own to run with her dog in, etc.  And, we currently live in a school district that is within the top 3 in the nation!  How do we move and ever match that?  A lot of things to think about, pray about.  And in the end, we will have to sit back and let the Lord decide what we should do.  If only I could learn to let things go and have faith.......

      No school today or tomorrow because of parent/teacher conferences.  We already had ours and, of course, R is doing wonderfully!  She's amazing!  So smart and she truly loves learning.  I hope that attitude always stays with her.  J has been going to school in addition to working full time, but he's off for two weeks (from school, not work) so we decided to have some long overdue family time.  We went to the Denver Zoo.  I don't think I mentioned that I live in Colorado in my first post.  Anyway......  When I was growing up, my older sister (9 years older than myself) played guitar and sang folk songs - that's what was popular then.  One of them was a song called The Zoo Song.  I know Peter, Paul and Mary recorded it and I think Tom Chapin, too.  I don't know who else nor who wrote it.  Anyway, every time we head to the zoo, my daughter wants to sing this song.  And we do.  It's part of our family ritual.  Thus, today's title.    R's favorite animals are the Zebras.  A dazzle of zebras is what she learned a herd was called when she studied Africa in kindergarten.  We always watch them for a long time.  I love the great apes.  This makes R crazy, so while I enjoyed watching them for a little bit, she and Daddy went into Bird World.  I never go into Bird World.  This stems from the 1980's and early 1990's when 'big' hair was in.  Apparently, my 'big' head of hair looked like prime nesting for birds because when I'd go into Bird World or some place similar, the birds would dive bomb at my head.  I kid you not!  As you can imagine, birds are not my favorite creature and I stay out of areas with lots of birds - captive or not!  lol.    The weather was a bit nippy today, so the animals were excited and very active.  It's the best time to go to the zoo.  The zoo also holds a special place in our hearts because J and I had a date there, early in our relationship.  We go every year to see the Zoo Lights - at Christmas - and we have a membership because we like to go so often.  Usually, we walk pretty quickly through the herd animals (except the zebras, of course).  But today, we stopped to look at the bactrian camels (2 humps).  I always talk to the animals (like a crazy person - lol) and generally they ignore me.  But today, this camel had been walking away from us and when I spoke, came back.  He stood in front of me and made some soft noises and just looked at me.  When we finally moved along to the information sign, he followed us.  The strange thing was that his eyes were both tearing.  Now, I'll probably ultimately find out this is normal, but it touched me and so we stayed there for a long time and I talked to this camel.  You know, saying things like, "Aren't you pretty."  I'll have to take some time to look up some info on camels.  We also saw a polar bear playing with a large, white tub.  She tossed it around, jumped on it, threw it.  And the brown bears were chasing each other and wresting today, too.    Well, by now it's obvious that we love animals and enjoy looking at them, reading about them, learning about them.  And by now it's very late and I'm struggling to formulate my thoughts.  Hopefully, this post makes sense and isn't filled with spelling errors.  But no matter.  I'm off to bed.

      Here I go, once again, with the hope that a favorite quote will help make it so:  When I write down my thoughts, they do not escape me.  This action makes me remember my strength.      -Isidore Ducasse  Let's see......I suppose the way to begin this would be to tell a bit about myself.  This I do for myself and then for anyone else who might read it.  I think the most important thing about me is that I am a mother and a wife.  Wife to a good man who struggles with depression, but who has made extraordinary strides in the last few months toward excellent mental health.  Mother to an extraordinary daughter whose laughter, intelligence and goodness of heart make my own heart swell all the more with love for her.  I love to write - mostly for my own pleasure, but occasionally, I do share my stories with others close to me.  I collect quotes of all kinds.  I love to read and sing but I'm shy and don't share my voice like I should.  I have a strong faith and believe with all my heart in the teachings of my church.  That faith has saved me from myself many times over.  I love to teach children and have a strong interest in the medical field.  I probably should have been a teacher or RN, but I was well into my late 20's and well established in my career when I realized this.  So I voluneer at my daughter's grade school and read with the kids one day a week and I'm taking a home school course to begin a career as a medical transcriptionist.  I watch E.R. and Third Watch every week.  If something's going on that will make me miss these two shows, I record them - lol.  I'm over 40 (and that's when I began to fall apart - lol).  I've been dieting off and on all my life.  I've lost hundreds of pounds over and over again - all the same pounds.  I'm still fat.  But I dream of being thin and I know, some day, with hope, help, hard work, determination, and sorting out the emotional demons that are at work to prevent my success, I will win this war.     We have a dog, Daisy.  She's part Border Collie and part Lab.  She's almost all black with just a touch of white on her chest.  She's not quite 2 years old, so she has a lot of energy.  But she and my husband, J, are buddies and he gives her lots of exercise every day.    We also have a cat, Lacey, who considers me her favorite plaything.  She jumps out at my feet and nips them as I walk through the house cleaning or whatever.  She likes to play hide and seek with me.  She likes to curl up in my arms in the evenings when I sit in my rocker to relax.  She is a comfort to have around because she slows down my busy life.  She and I are buddies.  My daughter, R, is a swimming, dancing, singing, reading, bike riding, creative, loving child.  She keeps me busy and fills every day of my life with love and joy.  I spend a lot of time laughing because she is funny and she knows it, too.   This blog is about two me's.  One is this woman who sits here today, fat and trying to change that, holding back some talents because someone might see her size.  The other is the woman who knows that one day she will be a thin woman who doesn't hold herself back and will be able to accomplish the things being fat steals from her.    Oh, and the artic paradise thing.......I'm not a summer person.  I don't like the heat (it makes me crabby) or bugs or being in the sun (because I was born a redhead and I burn really easily), or much of anything else about summer.  I like Spring, Fall and especially Winter.  So my paradise is an artic one.  But that's just me...........

      I was catching a bit of Jay Leno before I switched over to the Showtime series Dead Like Me (serious, very quirky and funny - we love it - catch it if you have a chance).  Anyway, some guest on Leno was talking about being six degrees of separation from some celeb.  So it popped into my head that I *Love* Mel Gibson.  I think he is a manly man, a wonderful family man (now, anyway), handsome (ohhhh those eyes), muscluar body (not body builder, but nice).  Possibly his only negative is that he is short - like most Hollywood actors - under six foot.  When we go to the theater nearest our house, they have a plaster of his foot and hand prints and a photo of him.  I always make a joke to J and R, "there's my boyfriend!".  R says that about him to me - and one day, most likely, to a group of people we are standing with who don't know the joke - lol.  Anyway, my friend - from the 'we see them every weekend' - told me her cousin's friend is the private pilot for Mel Gibson!!!  So, do you see?  I'm only 4 degrees of separation from my boyfriend, Mel Gibson!!!! LOL.  Both of my nieces live in Calif.  One, H, is a casting director and the other, C, is now a mommy and wife but schooled as a professional chef and before that, was trying to break into acting.  Anyway, C met Mel one time!  So, really, maybe I'm only 3 degrees from separation?!?!!?  Or is that 2????  lol.  When J and I were first married, we were laying in bed and I had my back to him, talking.  He told me he was getting up and I said, "Okay, Hon."  He got really angry and said, "Who's Ken????"  I was like, "What?  I didn't say anything about a Ken.  I don't even know a Ken.  I don't think I've ever known a Ken in my whole life!"  Well, he had misheard me, but it was too much to just let pass.  When he came home from work the next day, I was in bed with a Ken doll (you know, Barbie's boyfriend) on his pillow and was saying, "Oh, Ken!  You little hunk of man, you," etc.  He came in to the room, saw the doll and started laughing, then grabbed him and ripped his head off!  lol.  That led to teasing him about Mel.  One day when he came in from work he asked what I was watching on TV.  It was the Maverick movie Mel made.  I told him, being sure to remind him Mel Gibson was in it, then asked, "So, you wanna go make love?"  Very indignently, he said, "NOOOOOO!!"  LOL.  Ahhhhh, what fun.

      We went to the school 'Ice Cream Social' tonight.  First R had a Brownie's outing at a nature center.  It snowed today, too, so it was all indoors - lol.  I'm sure you see the irony in this - nature indoors........This state - blink and the weather changes.  We had 80 degrees a couple of days ago and now it's 30 degrees and snowing.  But that's part of what I love about living here.  Anyway, R had done the 'pet rocks' - a unicorn (the rock shaped like a horse head) and a turtle (obviously, a round rock).  She won 1st place for all of the first grade and then we'll find out Monday if she won on the overall vote (each grade's winner was voted on tonight).  Then, she won the cake contest - 1st place!!!  And at the cake walk at the activity tonight, her cake was the first one chosen!  She was walking on cloud 9!!!  She was so excited and I was so proud.  But now we have to make another castle cake for us to have at home.  I figured I'd have our friends over for dinner one night and that can be our dessert.  We didn't win anything in the cake walk, which R did 4 times alone and I did twice with her to use up our tickets.  I didn't see anything at the silent auction and didn't have to bid for her rocks back, so we just looked around at the stuff.  Some cool stuff donated by people and businesses to support the school.  We love our school.  We live in a school district that ranks within the top 3 in the nation.  It's an excellent school.  Excellent teachers.  We live in the ghetto part of the neighborhood so we can afford to be here - lol.  Oh, R also jumped rope (one of several activities for the kids).  She did pretty well and apparently has inhereited her Daddy's grace - lol.  No, I really think she had a tough time because she had on snow boots.  We had a good night.  J had to work overtime, though, so he was working (still is) while we were there.  Saw lots of people and realized I know a ton of people around here - kids, their parents, people from church who work at the school and their families, etc.  It's a comfortable feeling.  Plus, the people at school know me since I am there every week.  Yep, comfortable is what it is.    So, J got home last night from school and we started talking and got into a bit of a tiff.  Well, in the world of the depressive, you can't let stuff fester or it turns very bad.  So, we sat up talking for several hours.  In all, I got 3 hours or less of sleep last night.  So, when we got home from getting R and the cake to school this morning & breakfast, we crashed in bed for the day.  Yep, you heard it right, The Day!  I dropped in at about 11 a.m. and got up at 2:30!  Needless to say, I didn't finish cleaning my upstairs or the windows.........Now we have a bunch of stuff going on for the weekend - R's swimming lessons and her best friend is coming so they can swim together after for a couple of hours, then to a movie with our close friends (that we see almost every weekend), then it will be Sunday and we have church.  I have to squeeze in ironing clothes for church and preparing my lesson on Sat., too.  So when Monday comes, I'll be releived because I can rest - lol.  Except I have to finish Spring cleaning my upstairs......And look harder for work.......  Hmmm, it's getting late and I could go to bed in spite of that long nap today.  Yeah, over 40 is great.......lol.

      I've been scrubbing my house for 2 days now.  I've completed the downstairs except for the windows and finishing vacuuming the livingroom.  That means all my cupboards, closets, drawers, cabinets, pictures on the walls, the walls themselves, baseboards, etc - everything is cleaned up.  I've been meaning to do this for such a long time.  But I just didn't have the time.  Tomorrow I'll finish the downstairs windows and livingroom and then start upstairs.  I'll be glad to have it all done.  R had some activities she wanted to participate in at school for an 'Ice Cream Social' they are having tomorrow night that includes a Silent Auction.  She painted two 'pet rocks' and they won!  So, they will be offered at the Silent Auction.  Hopefully, no one will try to bid me out!  LOL.  Then, tonight, we baked a Castle Cake for the cake walk at the auction.  What a mess!  And my back has been really giving me fits (I could barely walk last night for several hours after cleaning all day and being bent over), so I was having a tough time making it through the whole thing without being a total crab about it.  But, R really wanted to do it and it turned out pretty good, R doing most of the work.  We used two mixes, pink icing, pink wafer cookies (for the drawbridge and door), string licorice (for the draw bridge chains) and cones - both sugar (for the tops) and flat bottomed (to form the columns).  Found the recipe and instructions on the web somewhere.  Then we sprinkled it with some pink and yellow sugar decoration.  We put gold covered Kisses on it all the way around, too.  It's cute and she felt good about it.  I took pictures for her, too.  I'm proud of her and glad that she likes to participate in all these things.  Wish I hadn't been in so much pain so I could have been more patient about everything and really enjoyed her joy in doing the cake.  I apologized to her, though.  Well, my breakthrough comes from my eating and trying to sort stuff out there.  You know, I mentioned I've been reading Dr. Phil again, trying to focus on some of that stuff.  I've been doing well, down 8 pounds so far.  But I have discovered that I have a very, very difficult time controlling my eating when I'm tired.  It's when I'm tired, above any other situation, that I eat too much.  And when I seem to be at my weakest.  So, today was terrible, foodwise.  Tomorrow, I just really have to watch it more carefully.  And I know that I can.  I think I just really needed to become aware of the weakness.      On to the surprise.  I've belonged to two e-mail groups for a long time.  One of them hasn't been posting much for.....oh, a year or so, I guess.  Things have picked up a little in the last week or two, though.  But that means 6 posts a day, maybe.  My other group posts a lot!  40-100 posts a day, depending.  Because I was struggling so much with schooling and there was so much going on here at home, I told them I wasn't going to post for a bit, a few days to a few weeks.  I knew two people had some surgery coming up -one I think would have had it by now, I'm pretty sure.  So when I told them I wouldn't post for a bit, I just wished them luck and that I'd keep them in my prayers.  I've been going in my e-mail every day or two and just deleting the posts there, because in all honesty, I haven't felt capable of handling all the posts and the worry about the couple of people having surgeries.  Today, one of the posts from my other group mentioned a member who has been off mail for a long time, so I went in to check out the list.  My other group didn't come up!!!!  Apparently, they took me off the list!  Now, I probably would eventually have done that (although I honestly was going to post an update to them today & find out if one of them did have surgery yet), but I've been in the group for a long time, so I was surprised they just took me off, not even telling me they were going to.  The truth is, I never really felt totally comfortable in the group, but I was still surprised.  On the other hand, I feel pretty relieved to be done with it because of not feeling totally comfortable there.  Although I admit I'm still a little worried about the two people having surgery.  Guess I'll have to just let that go, though.  And I guess it also says something about how they all felt about me being there, too.  So, I think it's best.  Still, I feel like crying about it, I think because I feel like I can't or shouldn't private e-mail anyone, as I did feel particularly close to two of them.  Plus, others have disappeared for a long period at a time, much longer than my week or two, without being taken off the list.  So, when I read this paragraph, it was definitely best.  Hmmmmm, this blog is more theraputic than a therapist! lol.    I called an old friend a few nights ago.  Hadn't spoken to her since her ex-husband passed away, just 10 months after her son died.  Hadn't seen her since her son's funeral, about 3 years ago.  We talked for a long time.  Shortly after her son died, she joined the LDS church.  Her other son, D, had married an LDS girl and joined the church before that.  It was good to speak to her and rekindle an old friendship that had been long term.  Another party, her ex's third wife, had done her best to interfer with and end our friendship and she had basically succeeded.  She did a lot of "she said this" and "she said that" and I don't think we realized what she was up to.  But, a fews years later we did and by then, our lives had changed a lot.  I was married, she was finishing raising her boys and seeing them into the world.  Then E died.  It was heartbreaking. This young man was about 7 years old when I first met him.  He was 28 when he died.  He used to give me "You are like a mother to me" cards on Mother's Day.  He stayed in touch with me even when his mom and I, nor his dad and I, really, were in touch.  His dad had MS and died 10 months after E's auto accident.  Since then, my friend has lost an uncle she was close to and her grandmother.  She is only 50 years old.  Her other son & his wife stay close, visit and go to church with her.  They are all they have in this state now as other family lives elsewhere.  I plan to call her much more often and get together with her, too.  Old friends are precious - even when rekindling a friendship requires effort.  My best friend from Jr. High School and I are still best friends.  I e-mail with a couple of women I went to High School with.  Our close friends, whom we get together with almost every weekend, are planning to move to Texas next summer.  But we'll stay in touch, even if we can't actually visit face to face.  These connections become more important to you as you get older.  It's history, a part of your life, and it matters on many levels.  Family, close friends, faith.  These are the things that matter most in life.  These are the things that bring joy into our lives.  A favorite scripture of mine is in 2 Nephi, chapter 2, verse 25:  "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy."  Life is about joy.  It's about being happy and enjoying our time on this earth as our souls....we....learn and prepare for our eternal lives.  My kids in my Sunday School class are at a crossroads.  They move from the little kid's Primary on to Young Men's and Young Women's.  And so we talk a lot about living our lives in a manner that allows us to "return with honor" to live with Heavenly Father, living in a way that shows we respect our bodies, others and the Lord.  "Return with Honor" rings out to me.  I have a lot of work to do on it, but it's what I strive for.  Sometimes, that means making hard choices.  And most of the time it means stepping up above from where I have been before.  I have a long way to go.  When I leave this earth, I will still have a long way to go.  But I'm gonna keep on climbing the best way I can so that when I go home to live with Him, I can Return to Him with Honor.  I've spent the last 3-5 years sending letters or cards to people I don't really stay in contact with anymore who helped me over the years.  I thank them and let them know how they influenced my life for the better.  It's a good way to make sure someone knows the good things they have done are remembered and appreciated.  And a good way for me to make sure they know how much I appreciated all they did for me.    It's really late.  I feel like I could write on and on tonight, but the clock says otherwise!  My heart just seems to be pouring out.  Maybe from some good, hard work on this house and time to think.  Whatever it is, it feels good.

      I've been really neglectful with this blog!  But with good reason.  I've been busting my hinney trying to get through my schooling and.......I finished it  yesterday!!!!!!!!!  I got my resume set up on Monster.com and applied to 4 different home based jobs there.  I'm going to check out the job ads in the paper and call some temp agencies to see what's out there, too.  Of course, if I can transcribe medical stuff, I can transcribe anything, so I won't limit myself.  But I'll be glad to be working when I find something and not have to worry so much about finances.  It's funny, initially I was so excited to be finished with school.  Relieved, too.  But then the realization that I have to find a job set in and now I feel a bit stressed again - lol.  Gee, can't win, I guess.  But I am going to focus the rest of this week on thouroughly cleaning my house - something I used to do at least once, if not twice, a year but haven't done in almost a year and a half!  It's a pit right now because I haven't even been keeping up the daily stuff very well.  But, after I take R to school in the morning, I'll be coming home and getting started on the living room - you know, because people see that first - lol.  I'm doing windows, baseboards, cleaning out end tables, dusting inside the curio cabinet and wiping down walls, door jams, etc.  It needs it so badly.  I'm sure the entire house, although quite small, will take me three days to finish since I'll do the whole house this well.  But the end result will be great!   J is having a tough time with his depression.  And, man, it's so hard to cope with him when it continues for several days (or weeks, as the case may be).  He was doing so well for such a long time, too, that it makes it even harder that he's on this roller coaster now.  It focuses on the struggles he's having with school, which is something I can't help him with.  And that's the hard part.  One day he's okay about it, feels like he can do it, and the next he's jumping down my throat about everything because he's feeling depressed and incapable.  I find myself really struggling not to be pulled down along with him into that pit of darkness, too.  This is something anyone living with a depressed person can attest to.  I find myself happy he's home before I see him and we start talking but then when we do, he often attacks me right away over one thing or another and then I find myself wishing he'd just go to work or school or anything but be home.  It's a stressful, awful way to live.  Tonight, though, I asked him to see his therapist weekly again until this passes.  He's been seeing her every other week, but right now I think he needs that extra support..........Just a few minutes ago, he called to apologize and let me know he talked to his teacher about struggling and that they worked some things out.  Hopefully, he'll be able to keep his mood up this little bit for a few days.  But I know better than to relax this early in the game.  I'm doing pretty good on my eating and I'll consider my exercise all the cleaning I'll be doing for the next few days.  But then I have to get serious about some formal exercise every day.  So, that's my plan there.  I don't know why this popped into my head - maybe because it's getting warm here (until Thurs. when they expect snow mixed with rain and, obviously, colder weather for a couple of days), so we're seeing a few bugs here and there.  I'm totally freaked out about bugs.  Grasshoppers, moths (especially those dang things), bees, spiders, etc.  And I was remembering my two brothers, when I was little, holding me down with a grasshopper in their hand yelling, "It's going to spit tobacco on you!" or a moth in their hand yelling, "It's going to get it's wing dust all over you and you'll get sick!" Jerks.  LOL.  They caused my bug phobia, I'm sure!  I love my brothers, though.  I'm closer to them than either of my sisters.  And as adults, they've been pretty protective of me, especially my older brother, KN.  He and R have a wonderful, close, special relationship. too.  Well, to give you an idea of how bad this phobia can be (I control it much better now, thankfully), when I started driving - at 15 because we lived in the country and everybody did it - I had a little, junky VW bug.  It was my first car.  When you turned a corner with a puddle, your leg got wet because the floor on the driver's side was rusting out - lol.  Anyway, my sister and I were 'cruising' around town and as we passed the baseball field on this warm summer day, a grasshopper jumped right in my window on to me.  I was only driving about 5 MPH, but I freaked out, jumped out of the car and then yelled at my then 13 year old sister to "Step on the brakes!  Step on the brakes!"  Of course, she did and thus was not killed in a terrible accident at 5 mph.  LOL.       When I was growing up, most of the time my younger sister and I shared a room.  I'm a neat person, like things to be in order - you know, sort of anal about cleanliness - lol.  J teases me asking if I'm sure I'm not related to Howard Hughes (who was a true phobic about cleanliness).  My younger sister is a major pack rat, messy, sloppy, etc.  When we shared a room, my "side" of the room would always be clean and neat, bed made (or the one time we shared a queen size bed, only my side of the bed was made - lol).  Ki's side:  mud balls she'd collected off the bottom of her boots, clothes all over the floor, papers under the bed and all over the floor, books on the floor.  Yeah, the floor was her storage space.  Then I married a messy guy and she married a guy who likes things neat and clean.  What were we thinking!!?!?!?!!??  lol.    The dog is sacked out on the couch....snoring!  Made me remember that I need to get to bed.  Hopefully, I'll post again soon........ :)

      Ahhhh, the computers are clean as of this morning!  Our satillite receiver bit the dust, but such is life.  We'll go get a new one tomorrow and it's actually been sort of nice not having a TV on.    I'm not sure what brought this to my mind, but I remember when I was in 6th grade and we lived in a small Colorado town for a year (then moved to another small town where I went to jr. and sr. high school).  Less than 2 blocks from our home was an old cemetery.  My younger sister and I used to go up there after dark during the summer, primarily for the thrill of the scare.  Now, cemeteries tend to be a little scary after dark anyway, but to add to it, the house and land next to it on one side was owned by a man who raised Mastiffs.  These dogs are huge and powerful.  To a kid, scary.  As kids, someone was always telling a story (made up, of course) of how one of the dogs - or a whole pack of them - escaped and tore a kid to shreds.  So here we would be in the cemetery, knowing the 'killer' Mastiffs where nearby and telling stories to scare ourselves even more.  One night, we were sitting on the ground, not realizing we were actually sitting on a grave, and the thing started to sink!  I don't think we ever screamed so loud or made it to our front yard so fast.  My mom and dad had heard us and were on their way out the door to see what was going on.  They thought we were full of baloney when we told them what had happened, but that could have been from embellishments about a hand reaching out or a foot being exposed.......who knows what all our overactive and primed for fear minds had created for us.   However, the next day we went to look and sure enough, the grave had begun to sink.  It was old and the cemetery itself was not well cared for, which I'm sure was what had happened, but it sure gave us a scare that night!  We still went back, but we never sat down on the ground there again.  Another story from when I was a kid had to do with Bonanza.  Loren Greene was the father of 4 grown boys, Little Joe - played by Michael Landon - being the youngest.  My sister was a tomboy all the way, so when we played Bonanza, she always wanted to BE Little Joe.  But I always wanted to be married to him!  And no way was my husband going to be HER!!!  lol.  One time, while she was playing cowboys with the boy down the street (as Litttle Joe, I'm sure), she fell out of our big oak tree in the front yard and landed in a squatting position.  Both her knees hit her eyes and her eyes ended up black and blue.  We called her Racoon.  Now doesn't that make you wish you had me and my siblings for your own?????  lol.  My sister got me back, though.  We lived across the street, side by side, with a family who had a son named Jerry.  He was older than I by several years, a real cutie and I had a crush on him.  My best friend was Mary and my name is Kerri.  She used to yell stuff when Jerry was outside and could hear her like, "Jerry Mary Kerri." and "Kerri Mary Jerry."  Thought she was real clever.  And embarrassed me beyond imagination.  I've always thought that one much worse than the Racoon thing......lol.  Okay, I don't know what got me reminicing about stuff, but it's late and I'm pooped.  I'm off to bed.

      I have just spent 3 extremely frustrating days working with a help site to get rid of a number of viruses on my computer and 2 other viruses on my daughter's & hubby's computer.  Read: missed 3 days of important completion work on my schooling.  I'm so close to being done and I probably would have made it by Monday if not for this!  Grrrrrrr!  Have these losers really nothing better to do with their lives than create these annoying (and sometimes destructive) things?  I'm mean, come on!  Get a Life!   Grrrrrrr!    Then, after all this time on the computers, I came downstairs tonight to find our satillite dish acting up.  We've had this thing for 8 or 9 years!  We've only had it go out maybe 3 or 4 times, and once was because we moved it to a better location and had to reset it.  The other 2 or 3 were weather related - heavy blizzards or downpours - which resolved within one half hour.  This time, they think it's our receiver.  So, go buy another, right?  Well, not until I'm working.  We're tapped out.  We've lived on credit and savings and whatever else for as long as we could and now there is no where to turn but an added paycheck from me working.  I'm very bummed.  Thank goodness for R's movies that will entertain her and my little black and white in the kitchen that my mom gave me when I was in my early 20's so I can catch the news here and there.    J has been very sick.  He can't keep himself well with these sinus issues.  He has to go have a CT scan on them, which we are in the process of setting up.  They think surgery will be necessary.  Poor guy.  Here he is in school part time (15-18 hours a week), working full time and he keeps getting these sinus infections that are running him down.  And this semester, he's struggling with his math.  He's on the edge with it all, too.   I'm really, really tired all the time these last 1-2 weeks.  I need to get back to exercising and eating better.  We go for a barbeque at a friend's tomorrow and then Monday I absolutely HAVE to get it together again.  I was doing sooooo well before Easter.  I can do it again, too.  And I will!  I have been really feeling stressed.  With so much going on with J, feeling so worried about finances, trying so hard to get my schooling done (some nights I'm up until midnight or better working on it) and the problems we're having with R sleeping (she wants to be in our bed at 1 a.m. or 11 p.m., etc when the rule is not until 5 a.m. for some cuddling before we have to get up for the day).  It's just gotten out of hand.  She's very stubborn, so she fights to stay awake, wakes herself up all night long, etc.  Everyone is tired around here.  I'm sure you can imagine that makes for a bit of disharmony among the troops.....lol.    Ahhhhhh, but the big picture is that this, too, shall pass and things will get better.  J will figure out that math and get well.  I will finish school and get some work soon.  R will get better about staying in her own bed.  We will all start getting some sleep.  There is always a light at the end of the tunnel.  Our cups are always half-full.  We have only to look at life in such a way as to see the sun shining upon us.  Years ago, I got a copy of The Optimist Creed from a friend who was a recovering alcoholic.  As you can imagine, she worked hard to look at life in this way:  Promise Yourself:  To be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind.  To talk health, happiness and prosperity to every person you meet.  To make all your friends feel that there is something in them.  To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true.  To think only of the best, to work only for the best, and to expect only the best.  To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own.  To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future.  To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile.  To give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others.  To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear and too happy to permit the presence of trouble.   I love that outlook on life!  I love what good it can do a person to live in such a way!  And I love that it is something every single living person can strive for.    This isn't the only creed that is taped up on my desk wall (a computer cabinet), either.  I also have the creed of a prophet of my church, George Albert Smith, that I admire greatly and strive toward.  This is what it says:    I would be a friend to the friendless and find joy in ministering to the needs of the poor. I would visit the sick and afflicted and inspire in them a desire for faith to be healed. i would teach the truth to the understanding and blessing of all mankind. I would seek out the erring one and try to win him back to a righteous and a happy life. I would not seek to force people to live up to my ideas, but rather love them into doing the thing that is right. I would live with the masses and help to solve their problems that their earth life may be happy. I would avoid the publicity of high positions and discourage the flattery of thoughtless friends. I would not knowingly wound the feeling of any, not even one who may have wronged me, but would seek to do him good and make him my friend. I would overcome the tendency to selfishness and jealousy and rejoice in the success of all the children of my Heavenly Father. I would not be an enemy to any living soul. Know that the Redeemer of mankind has offered to the world the only plan that will fully develop us and make us really happy here and hereafter, I feel it not only a duty but also a blessed priviledge to disseminate this truth.  Such powerful words, but even more powerful actions - as is always the case in life.    Being able to put the last 3 day's struggles and frustrations behind me and focusing on these 'good words' has given me a calm I desperately needed.  I can't express how much better I feel.  I'm going to do some school work, dishes, laundry and then head off to bed.  Tomorrow is Sunday and we will see some friends and focus on the Sabbath and all that it means to us.  Peace.

      Yesterday, we went to R's best friend's baptism.  In our church, we believe children are born without sin, innocent and pure since their spirits have just come to us from living with the Lord.  We don't believe in original sin, as some faiths do.  We believe a loving Heavenly Father would expect us to be responsible for our own actions, not someone before us.  When our babies are born, instead of baptism, they are given a father's blessing.  The men in our church, if they live worthy (meaning obedient to the Lord's commandments), hold the priesthood.  So, when R was a newborn, J gave her a father's blessing before our congregation.  When a child turns 8 years old, they are determined to be old enough to understand right from wrong.  They've been learning these things from their parents and church all their lives.  So, at 8, they are baptized by immersion (completely under water).  Again, usually the child's father baptizes them.  The children in our church look forward to this wonderful, sacred experience and in the months leading up to their 8th birthdays, they prepare very seriously for this event.  So, on Saturday, we watched S be baptized by her father.  R was very excited and sat very close to the batismal font (as most of the children did) so she could see it all.  It was very precious.  Anyway, from watching this on Saturday, I realized that R's 8th birthday is only 7 months away.  I feel like there is so much to do to help her prepare for this.  So much to be sure she understands.  Afterall, the children are given a choice to be baptized, which officially makes them members of our church, so she needs to understand what she is choosing to do.  S was also comfirmed yesterday.  This is when the gift of the Holy Ghost is given to her.  We believe that prior to this, we have the Holy Ghost with us only occasionally - when we most need him.  But after, if we live worthy lives and repent when we have sinned, the Holy Ghost will dwell within us always.    With all of this in mind, I found myself feeling the need to recommit my family to our gospel teachings.  For us, this means daily scripture reading both as a family and individually, daily family prayer and individual prayer.  Also, one day a week for Family Home Evening (FHE) - when we spend several hours as a family without interruption of TV, phone, visitors (unless we invite someone to join us for it).  Generally, a lesson is given (scriptural) and maybe a song or two, prayer, discussing our day or week and then fun activities and refreshments.  We often times have a treasure hunt, one of R's favorite activities.  At the end of the hunt, there is usually a treat of some sort.  But we've also done a family craft in the past, or watched a religious themed movie (Veggie Tales or some church issued film).  And these events are really wonderful, bringing our family closer together and filling our home with the Holy Spirit.  But, with J working the hours he does and all the activities that go on, we have a hard time doing it.  Generally, most LDS families have FHE  on Monday night.  We can't because of J's work.  So we have to pick another night, usually Friday.  But, I've been lacking in preparing those evenings, even though I have wonderful church resources to help me come up with ideas for it.  Sadly, a lot of what we 'should' be doing seems difficult, at best.  But it shouldn't.  It's clearly a matter of prioritizing things.  If we let TV, chores, etc come first, then these important spiritual matters will be put on the back burner.  Just as Satan has intended.  Now, though, the stakes are higher.  I really must reorganize our lives so that we are sure to include these important activities in our weekly, daily, lives in helping R prepare for her own baptism.   And once we make it a priority in our lives, everything will fall more easily in to place.  So, that is what I am thinking about for a precious 8 year old girl (not to mention J and I).

      Sunday is Easter.  We go to church, we read the scripture story and this year I bought Resurrection Eggs.  It's a dozen plastic eggs and each contains a symbol of Christ's crucifiction and resurrection.  I love object lessons for kids because they really remember them.  For the basket, I went easy on the chocolate.  It's not like we need any.  But it's every kid's hearts desire to wake up to an Easter basket with a chocolate bunny (whose ears may or may not still be intact - lol) and eggs to hunt.  No, I never ate the ears off of R's bunny.  But I always want to.  lol.  I got a couple of little toys for her basket, too.  A chirping chick, a little bunny, a My Little Pony.....R loves those.  I enjoy seeing these 'retro' toys back in stores.  Not that they were around when I was little - ahem.  Well, except for Rock 'em, Sock 'em Robots.  I had that one.    I have no idea where my thoughts are going tonight.  I'm really too tired to be posting anything, but it had been a couple of days.  I'm on day 3 of eating healthy again, but I haven't managed to get a workout in just yet.  I will, though.  And now, I'm off to bed.

      Walt Whitman said, "Not I - Not anyone else can travel that road for you.  You must travel it for yourself."  No one but myself can take my hand out of the refridgerator and away from my mouth.  No one but myself can make me get up and exercise every day.  No one but myself can travel this road for me.  I must travel it for myself.  Today, I have traveled that road.  Tomorrow, I will face it from the beginning once again, because each day will have it's own challenges.  Each day will present new things, time frames, frustrations, joys, boredom, tiredness, etc.  I intent to enable myself to walk that road each day anew.    "Finish each day and be done with it.  You have done what you could.  Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can.     Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense."  Now those are words to live by!  Those are words to take to heart and make your own.

      If only it was something that was over in 6 weeks time.  But no, this getting healthy and getting thin and getting fit is a life-long commitment and it's one I must embark on once again.  And the part that makes it tough is that it is a big change from how I have eaten and lived almost my entire life.  All my examples my whole life have been overeating, binge eating, secret eating, sedentary lifestyle.  For someone who doesn't struggle with their weight, this is all hard to understand.  But those of us who do struggle, especially with large amounts of weight, we know full well the major, life-long challenge this will be.  Almost three years ago, I weighed 65 pounds less than I do now.  Mind you, I wasn't at my goal weight with that, either.  But, oh, I felt so much better, had so much more energy, was so much more active than I am now.  And, to make matters worse, I am getting older.  There are aches and pains that have never been there before and would not be there, I am sure, if not for my weight.  There is plenty of motivation there to make me want to get busy and get this weight off.  So.....what makes it so hard?  What makes me give in so easily to food temptations?  What makes me throw my resolve away without a thought, knowing full well I will regret it once my stomach is full?  I think it's about making up your mind that enough is enough.  That it's about learning to fulfill the emotional voids and struggles with something other than food.  I think it's also about loving yourself enough to do something good, for the long term, for yourself.  And these are where I fall short.  I have always struggled with my self esteem.  I wasn't nurtured at all, in that way, while growing up.  Because that nurture was almost non-existent, I remember only one time in my life my father ever said anything supportive about me until I became an adult.  It was when I was about 18, living away from home and having lost a lot of weight because I was too broke to buy groceries.  I only ate on the days I worked.  And at a family get together at a park in that town, my younger sister said some cutting remark to me.  Mind you, this is how we were raised - insulting each other, cutting each other down, competitive in very, very negative ways, so I don't blame her.  She didn't know any better, didn't know what damage she was doing.  None of us realized at first.  And my father said something along the lines of, "She's the better looking one." - meaning me.  I was shocked and said, "What?"  He said, and this part I always remember so clearly, "I call them as I sees them."  That was it.  My mother, on the other hand, said I was too thin.  But I wasn't even at a normal weight yet at that time.    Now that sounds really whiny and maybe blaming.  But that's not what I mean to do.  I only mean to demonstrate that my self esteem did not just suddenly destruct.  And what I prefer to say about my childhood, is that while it was not a happy one, in my memory, it was not horrible.  They did the best they knew how.  And that's all you can ask of a person.  Then you strive to be better than that.    Now, I was also given food when I was upset, crying, had hurt feelings, etc.  Because that's how my mother was raised and she didn't know any better.  So, these life-long habits and actions are hard to get past and stay past.  As anyone with an addiction knows, it is far too easy to fall back to where you had been.  And overeating, binge eating, secret eating - these things add up to a food addiction.    Okay.  That determined, what's next?  I reach out for the support I have gathered around myself over the last few years (the same support that helped me get 65 pounds off me a few years ago).  I make up my mind that I can and will overcome this sickness concerning the importance of food in my life.  I pray for help (which is, by the way, how I stopped smoking over 12 years or so ago).  I rid my home of tempting, unhealthy foods.  I exercise because it releases seratonin into my body and that lifts my spirits.  I tell myself I am worth it (a vision of the guy from Saturday Night Live - Stuart Smalley - saying, "I'm good enough.  I'm worth it.  And, gosh darn it, people like me!" - or something like that).  I let myself love me - the way I see the love my daughter has for me in her eyes and the way my husband's love for me shows in his.  Plus, I journal my food, making up a menu each night, I report my progress to someone who helps me be accountable for what I do, I envision myself thinner, healthier, more active every day.  Sounds easy, eh?  Yeah, right.......lol.  It's going to be a lot of work.  Just like it was 65 pounds ago.  But this time, I want to.....no, I will keep going until I reach my healthy goal.  So, Pooh, to answer your question, it takes your whole life because you have to always work on being a better, healthier you.  Come on, Pooh.  Take my hand.  Let's walk together toward a happier, healtier life.

      What a relief!  Tomorrow is Monday and R is back at school.  I love my girl beyond anything, but this has been a trying week.  I did end up with a sinus and upper respiratory infection and my asthma kicked in, so I wasn't feeling like jumping up and down.  And I'm sure that's what has made it so rough.  That, and my girl is dramatic and sometimes extreme about little things - lol.  But, that's what makes her such a great actress.  I took R to the library one day (something we do every week during the summer) and then another day I took her and her best friend, S, to the museum.  They had a great time!  We went into the Space Odyssy section first and they saw a simulation of one of the workers being on Mars and taking soil samples and such.  He told them all sorts of things about Mars and space travel, then the kids are able to ask questions.  There are all kinds of experiments and simulations for the Mars atmosphere and space, in general, and an infrared area where they have a table set up with cameras.  On the table, you can experiment with a hot and a cold plate, placing different things on it.  They have metal and wood and, of course, your own hands.  Then there is a big screen, like a TV, that you can stand in front of and have your whole body shown in infrared.  The girls loved it and we stayed there for a long time.  We did a few more things in the Space Odyssy, then did a quick stop at the Egyptian section.  R is afraid of mummy's, so we didn't stay long - lol.  Finally, we went to the section we'd actually intended to see, the Inca exhibit.  There was a film about the discovery and continuing exploration of Machu Picchu.  What an amazing feat of engineering!  There was some info about the Aztec and Mayans, too.  The girls were really facinated by the different pots and jars and the weavings.  Then we went into the interactive area and they 'dug' for bits of pottery that they could match up with some exhibit pieces, as well as some 'gold' pieces imbedded in the floor of  the 'ruins of a goldsmith's home'.  It was so cute listening to them as they uncovered 'treasures'.  They had wooden llamas they could ride on and an adobe room they could go into.  After more than 4 hours, they finally told me they were very hungry and had to eat 'right now'!  So, we grabbed a very late lunch and then headed home.  S. stayed after we got here and played until 5:30 or so.  It was an exhausting but fun day for us all!  I got a great deal on some clearance stuff at Target a couple of weeks ago.  It was the Fairy Princess bedroom set.  I bought a quilt and pillow sham, sheets, canopy (the kind that hang from the ceiling over the top of the bed), castle shaped knobs for R's desk/bookshelf/cabinets combo piece of furniture, 2 hooks, 2 wall shelves that are shaped like a castle tower and each has a draw in it, some wall appliques that have stars and wands and four main pieces that say, 'Once upon a time' with a castle on clouds on it and 'In a land far, far away' with the same on it.  The third one was, 'There lived a fairy princess' which has a couple of fairy princesses on it in different poses and 'Who could make dreams come true' with more fairies on it.  Then I picked up some pretty light purple curtains that match (because the set only came with sheers).  R loves it!  And she's a big fan of unicorns, so I painted over the cat stampers we'd done on the desk combo furniture, which is painted white, and we'll be stamping unicorns on it and filling in with left over appliques of wands and stars.  I've got it all put together except for finishing the desk painting.  I have to paint a second coat of white on it, then on Monday I can do the stamping.  It has to dry for 30 days before you can put the appliques on it.  R is thrilled with her room and it fits her personality so well.  Shoot, when I got everything done but the desk, it was MY dream room!  lol.  J has been teasing me about how I'm going to decorate our bedroom now.  I told him maybe in carosal horses!  lol.  Actually, the next room I redo will be R's bathroom.  She wants it in a sea theme but wants mermaids, too.  I can find plenty of fish, sea, water themes, but no mermaids so far.  We'll have to see if I can locate a stamper of a mermaid or something.  Plus, I'll want to paint that room blue first.  It's white right now.  But, that's a ways off......

      I reread my posts about this pot luck picnic thing on Sunday.  I feel really awful, but also grateful that I have this blog to vent my feelings in.  The reason I feel awful?  I miss understood some information and got some bad information so I had to eat crow today and stop crying about this situation on Sunday.  I called my other brother, the one I'm closest to and that R adores, and found out that, first, he's coming up here for the picnic and also that my married brother isn't actually in town yet.  He flies in on Thursday.  So he's not here for a whole week.  He's here for 3 days.  This changes things dramatically because it's completely understandable with only 3 days here that he had to make these plans for everyone to meet at one location (although I still wish he'd have worked something different out for my other brother and my family to see them).  Obviously, 1. my version of 'about a week' and his version of that (which is originally what he told me some time ago) are two very different things and 2. there are a lot of old wounds at play here.  Then I let myself fall into my low self esteem reactions.  I posted this morning that I'd called him and left a message on his cell.  Basically, I explained I needed to get the details of where the picnic would be and what time because I was having trouble finding someone to teach my Sunday School class, J has to work at 9 p.m. that night so we needed to work out his sleep schedule and it's sort of a difficult day for us.  When my brother called back, he said he'd missed the message because he was working out at "a gym" (so I thought a gym here).  Told him no problem and got the info and told him I was trying to get someone to teach my class, but was having a hard time finding someone so didn't know if we'd make it.  Still thinking he was already here in town made his response hurt terribly.  He said, "Okay, Hon.  If you can't, you can't."  What I need to say here is how I felt about all this.  No, how I feel about things between he and I.  When I was a teen, he and I had a bad argument.  I said something that hurt him very much.  But we mended our relationship and got very close after that.  After he married, that still remained until D got upset that he was....I don't know, helping me out, being close to me.  Whatever it was.  I think her insecurities and maybe jealousy over my closeness to him came up.  She told him, "She's not your wife, I am."  But I never thought he did anything to deserve that allegation or whatever you want to call it.  And certainly, he's done just as much for people in her family over the years.  He wouldn't ignore his family's needs to help me or anything even close to that.  But I did turn to him for advise and he is the one who brought me into the church.  A couple of times, before I was in my 20's, he helped me with some things like buying a transmission for a car I had and helping pay to repair it.  I lived with them for a short time, too, and helped take care of my nieces while I was there.  I put them to bed every night and told them stories, spent time with them, etc.  But D and I were close then, too.  We exercised together, ran around together, etc.  Then something I can't recall or didn't think was a big deal made the relationship between she and I change.  I couldn't even pinpoint when.  I did live with her brother for a little while, but everything was good there the whole time.  He was a great roommate, he just had a drug problem and I took him to a rehab place to get help.  I also lived with her sister for a while and that was hell, to be honest.  Two women in a house doesn't cut it, in my opinion (which is why most of my life I lived alone until I married).  But we were sort of helping each other out at the time.  And we seem to be okay between us (what little I've seen of her in the past....maybe in 8 years it would be twice).  Anyway, with how I feel about things between my brother and I......I feel like we aren't very important to him.  I feel like we come at the bottom of the pile compared to D's family.  I feel like he would jump through hoops to make sure they see her family, but if no one saw us, no big deal.  I feel like even though I've always been there for my nieces, they've been raised not to feel any obligation toward family (basically, I mean this side of the family because I know they stay in touch with some of those on D's side) and that has been hurtful because I've worked so hard to stay in touch with them and always make sure they know I love them.             Anyway, I called my other brother, and he said he is coming on Sunday, also, and he will go with us.  We can all leave after not too terribly long, because he understands how uncomfortable it will be, too.  Obviously, no matter how you look at it, it's not going to be a terribly comfortable situation for us.  We will be around a large number of people that are my SIL's relatives and that we either don't know at all or know a little but haven't even spoken to (other than my niece's wedding last Sept. for 5 seconds)in many, many years.  So, we'll go long enough to visit a bit with the girls and my brother and SIL and see the baby, then I suspect we'll head out.  I still haven't found anyone to take my Sunday School class yet, though, and that's stressful.  I feel bad, too, because we missed 2 Sunday's ago when I went to my home town for my best friend's daughter's graduation.  But after this, we'll make sure other stuff doesn't come up to keep us from church.  You know, just typing all this has worn me out.  I'm gonna just go to bed now and not go on with this.  It's been to stressful and emotional for the past 2 days for me.  I'm pooped.

      R was up around 7:30 this morning, which is pretty good.  I dozed until about 8:00 and then got up, too.  I went to bed to late last night - my own fault for getting caught up in a movie I had on, which I can't even remember the name of - lol.  Anyway, shortly after that, the phone rang.  I expected it to be J, telling me where he was on his bike ride home from work (he actually called a few minutes later).  But instead, it was my friend, K, telling me her husband pulled up in the drive-way around 11 p.m. last night - home from Iraq!  She knew he was coming home sometime over about a 3 day span, but she didn't expect him yesterday.  And he's only home for a couple of weeks, then goes back, but it's been about six months since they've seen each other.  Their son was totally surprised because they hadn't told him his dad might be coming home at all until his 1 year contract is up.  Anyway, we're planning to get together for dinner on Wed. so we can see them.  It will be great!  I've been e-mailing with him, but I'm looking forward to hearing more about the culture and his experiences.  This will be the last time we see him for a while as they are moving to Texas this summer.  At first it was going to be in August, but yesterday (their son is in my Sunday School class), their son said it would be in July.  It's heartbreaking to me because K is one of my best friends.  But everyone must do what is best for their families and this move will be good for all of them.  I'm still struggling with this thing about seeing my brother and his family on Sunday at a pot luck picnic with all my sister-in-law's family.  I keep running senerios through my mind on how to get out of going.  But I feel sure that if do anything but go, it will cause problems, even though there are complications for us.  Already I don't think my SIL cares much for me anymore.  I think they forget who did what or said what and I get stuck in a category I don't think I deserve over her and my nieces.  Anyway, I wrote about the details on the 29th in here (the first post on that date) if you're reading and need to know what this is all about.  I'm finding this really stressful.  And now I wish they'd never come to Colorado.  I don't even care as much if I see the baby or not, because the stress of the circumstances is outweighing my desire to see them.  I hate that it has to be this way.  Why can't my brother just realize how uncomfortable it will be for us?  Why can't he see how difficult Sunday is for us?    Okay, I stopped pussyfooting around here.  I called his cell phone and left a message asking when and where this picnic was.  Told him I needed to know as soon as possible because I was having a hard time finding someone to take my Sunday School class, J works that night at 9 p.m. and we needed to plan out his sleep schedule and that it was sort of a difficult day for us.  My best hope will be that he will tell us we'll work something else out.  But if not, we'll just put in an appearance and then leave shortly after.  It's just not worth the stress at this point.  Even though that sounds pretty sad to me.  Anyway, we'll see what comes of it.

      Sometimes I think I'm dreaming when things are so good between J and I.  I've said before, he has his ups and downs with this darn depression stuff, but overall, things are so much better than they've been in years.  I'm so grateful for that - that he takes the effort to get better, to improve our marriage, to improve himself, etc.    I just have to tell this R story: R watches a couple of shows on one of the kid's channels every morning before school.  Lately, it's been some show called Brum, then The Magic School Bus and then Hi 5.  Anyway, a couple of days ago, she was watching Magic School Bus while I was out doing the dishes in the kitchen.  All of the sudden, I heard her kind of....not whining or screaming, but just sort of freaking out.  I couldn't make out what she was saying, though.  I came out to see if everything was okay and she was curled up on the sofa, watching her show.  I asked what was wrong and she said, "I'm made of cells!  Ewwwww, I'm made of cells!"  LOL.  Well I just laughed and said we all are, but it was sure funny that she was freaking out about it.  That kid is a piece of work!  lol.  Taught my Sunday School class today, of course.  These kids crack me up sometimes.  Today, near the end of our lesson, B - the one we call Monkey-Boy - was telling how his neighbor-friend's cat killed a little bunny (with all the gory details, of course) and then he was talking about what happened to the......body of it.....and before he could get even more gory and gross in what he was telling us, I said, "And then a monkey grabbed it and ran off with it!"  Everyone, including him, cracked up!  He never fully recovered to tell the story worse, but eventually regained himself enough to say, "No, no" and try to go on.  Well, he was leaning against a small, round table in the room and out of the blue, one of the 4 legs fell off.  Of course, he freaked out and started saying, "I didn't do anything!  It just fell off!"  So I said, "It's okay, B, I know you didn't do it.  It was a wild gang of monkeys that ran into  the room."  Usually it's B making the monkey comments, but I got him this morning!  lol.  After I dismissed them, one of the girls told everyone to wait to hear a ghost story she just heard from her mom.  It was funny in the end but I think typing it would ruin it.  It would never come across right.  Anyway, it was a fun day with them.    On to my Gratitude Journal for today:  1.  I am grateful for good laughter and fun, a room full of listening kids, and a lesson that goes well and is heard.  2.  I am grateful for J and how kind he has been to me for these days while I've been sick.  He's cuddled with me, talked sweetly to me, helped me with simple things and just been there as much as he could.    3.  I am grateful for the way J always opens the car door for me, gets R and I into the car, then walks around to his door to get in.  It's so nice to have a door opened for me and that same curtesy for my daughter.  4.  I am grateful for everyone at church who stayed for the "Linger Longer" and chatted with us, smiled at us, fellowshiped with us today and every Sunday.  They are good and decent people and it is nice to know that wherever we might go in this world, we will be with people in our church who will treat us well - like family (just not the disfunctional kind - lol).  5.  I am grateful for the cooler day we had today after so many days of high 80's and for the rain we got yesterday (we're in a drought here).  Well, I'm off for tonight.

      1.  I am grateful that I know what I should do, even when it's hard and sometimes even painful.  And that I do it, even when I don't really want to.  I'm not a quitter, that's for certain!  2.  I am grateful for the Creed of George Albert Smith and the influence it's had in my life (posted on this blog in April 2004).  And the ability to understand it's deepest meanings.  3.  I am grateful for my daughter who lifts my spirits on even my toughest days, who understands when mom is sick, who loves me and forgives me my imperfections and who lets me be who I am without expecting me to change to suit her.  Hope that lasts when she's a teen - LOL.  4.  I am grateful for the gospel in my life because without it, I really don't know how I could cope with everything.  I know others have it harder in some ways and that I am lucky to have what I do.  But we each grieve for our loses, no matter what they are.  This gospel and it's teachings give me hope that the 4 miscarriages I've had will be babies I will be with again one day in heaven.  It gives me hope that trying my best as often as I am able will help me to be a better person.  It gives me hope that there are better things ahead if we do our best to live righteous lives.  5.  I am grateful for the card I got from someone at church that surprised me, then talked about her appreciation for the spirituality I share with the kids in my class and that she sees in me.  She subbed for me one Sunday.  I don't know her really well, so it was a surprise she sent a card at all, but even more so that she sees what she does in me.  It was really very sweet and really made me feel like working on the spiritual side of my life is taking affect in me.

      Well, my barely a cold turned into bronchitis!  I can't believe how often I've been sick this year.  R and J, too, but J is sick because of the problems requiring his upcoming surgery on his sinuses on June 16th.  Unfortunately, he just keeps passing on the love - lol.  But, I'm better today after 24 hours on antibiotics and my nebulizer.  Blahhhh.  Wears me down, though.  Took R to her swimming lessons and we took her best friend again.  This morning, they came and got R to take her out to breakfast with them.  Then I picked the girls up at S's house and took them swimming.  We stayed for 2 hours after the 1/2 swimming lesson and then came home.  S stayed and played, had dinner with us and then her mom came to get her at about 5 p.m.  Long day but it kept R occupied so I could relax a bit.  Had a rough night sleeping last night with a lot of coughing.  And, I went to bed upset.  My brother who is married (not the one I'm closest to that R adores) called saying they were going to be in town for 'a few days' with my niece who had a baby a few months ago, my other niece and the baby.  He is flying them in from Calif. and he and his wife are from Texas.  They had told me they were coming in June and would come by to see us with the new baby, so I was expecting them.  What I wasn't expecting is that they want us to meet at a park for a pot luck with all of my sister-in-law's family.  So it will be J, R and I and about 15-20 some of D's family.  So, okay, they don't want to take the baby all over the place.  Understandable.  Especially since D has a lot of family here.  But then I find out from my mother that they are actually here for a whole week, staying at D's sister's.  My nieces will stay there, too, then one will also stay at her grandma's here, then with some friends.  But if we want to see the baby and my nieces, we have to miss church, go to the park with some pot luck item, squeeze in a little time with 15-20 some other strangers - I only know a few and none of them well because other than my niece's wedding in September, I hadn't seen any of them in years - and then rush home so J can sleep so he can go to work that night.  We'll be lucky to have much time at all to visit and we'll be uncomfortable because we will be the only 3 of 'our' side of the family there.  We'll be trying to have a visit with family we love among strangers, basically.  If I wasn't such a stupid sucker about putting out the effort that no one else in my family is willing to do to stay in touch, I'd say "screw it".  But, no, I keep the peace.  I always make the calls to see how everyone is.  I always do 'the right thing', no matter what the outcome is for me.  I hate that I do that but at the same time, I can't stop.  And what it ultimately means is that I am hurt over and over again because I care about what becomes of us all. It's just so stupid of me.    Anyway, I got to thinking how he has told me in the past how they appreciate that I accepted his wife into the family and her daughters (my nieces) without any qualms.  See, it was an issue for my parents and some of my siblings.  D is 4 years older than my brother and this is her 3rd marriage, plus he was going to be taking on two little girls (they were only 2 & 3 when they married)and the rest of my family, especially my mother, had some negative feelings about D's family.  I can't really explain what that was all about because I don't get it.  Things were said between my mom and her mom and it upset my mom (and her mom, too, I'm sure).  And I don't know what else went on.  But my brother loved her and so that was good enough for me.  I have adored my nieces from the moment I met them.  I've always remembered them for their birthdays and Christmas.  Always.  And I got to thinking that my brother tells me how he has to send stuff to his godchildren (2 kids from a family that were their neighbors years ago) but he has only remembered R's birthday 3 or 4 times in her life and Christmas for her maybe as many times.  I still send my nieces birthday and Christmas cards every year.  So, it really hurt my feelings.  I ended up crying half the night about it.  I just don't get it.  And if it's my sister-in-law who doesn't want contact with us, what's up with that?    So, I wish I didn't even have to do this at all.  It's almost not worth seeing them to go through being uncomfortable the whole time.  Of course, I'll go and be miserable and nervous and hate the whole thing.  But I'll put a smile on my face and coo over the baby whom we'll probably get to see for 10 minutes, and hug them and smile and blah, blah, blah.  Then we'll hurry home to ease the stress, let J get some sleep and be happy with our little carved out 15 minutes of fame because that's all we're going to get.  I guess he's really disappointed me in the long run.  And that probably breaks my heart more than anything else because I always thought, growing up and until sometime in my 20's, that he was a pretty great guy, almost perfect.  Of course, no one is, but I expected more from him.  And that's the hard part.  Well, always a help to get things off my chest with this blog.  It really is good theapy.  And it's free!  lol.  Off to bathe my angel.

      Almost forgot this, although I could have done it tonight....  1.  I am grateful for the support of the members of my church who are so willing to take an extra step to help one another.  2.  I am grateful for my husband being patient about my job hunt and not getting all over me about it (although he's fighting a bit of depression which I think will be gone once his Tour de Cure bike ride is over June 12th - he's just feeling overwhelmed.  Hope he's better after this week when he has 2 weeks off from school, though).  3.  I am grateful for the thoughtfulness of people.  I go to R's school every week, as do several parents.  So the PTCO had a luncheon for all the parents that volunteer.  It was catered and wonderful chatting and laughing with everyone and then, and it's the part I liked best, we got tag holders with the school colors and name on it for our volunteer security tags.  It was really cool.  I love them!  4.  I am grateful for the sincerity of people.  R's teacher got all the volunteer parents plants (there are actually 5 teachers all together).  It was so nice, but the best part was the sincerity in their thank you's.  5.  I am grateful that my pal, D, had her bypass surgery and all went well.  She's such a sweet lady, so passionate and creative and kind.  She's a blessing in my life and I'm so glad she's on the road to recovery now.  I just pray it's not too painful.

      I've been making lots of calls to day, hoping something will come up for me for a job.  I've been sending a lot of resumes on-line for a couple of weeks with either no response, telling me they just filled their positions or telling me they only hire experienced people.  A bit disheartening.  Then I started calling some places.  One person wants my resume, needs help, but is in a bind and needs someone with experience who can jump right in.  She's only got one other person to interview, though, who only has minimal experience.  So, we'll see.  But, that's probably not going anywhere.  I'll sure give it my best effort,anyway.  I also called the place I'd interviewed with before I'd finished my course and they wanted me to go further before they'd want to hire me.  They also mentioned only wanting full time, but I called and left a message and said I'm only interesting in part time (3-4 hours a day, M-F).  So we'll see what comes of that.  Then I started calling insurance companies because I have 8 years experience in insurance as an adjuster and if I can do medical transcription, I can do any kind of transcription.  Next, I called a couple of women from church who gave me suggests of who I could contact and I've left some messages for those people.  Lots of calls to wait to hear back on, but I'm hoping from all of that, something will come up for me.  Oh, and a contact my hairdresser gave me is checking with a friend of hers who owns her own transcription business to see if she is interested in working with me.  I'm going to wait until early next week to hear back on all this because of the upcoming Memorial Day weekend and several people mentioned going out of town and having to get back with me next week.  I've got so many calls out there right now, I'm worried about making anymore and keeping them straight.  So, I'll hang in there until I hear back on most of them next week.  By next Thursday, I'll start calling other places again.  It's all so scary!  Both trying to find a job and also worrying that I'm not going to find one.  If I don't, what am I going to do?  Probably get stuck doing daycare again, which I have to honestly admit, I did not love doing.  Parents tend to take such advantage of you.  One of my kids when I did it before stayed with me 12 hours every day and sometimes longer.  Then his parents would make plans to go out later that night and want me to watch him more - to which I said no.  But they got someone else to watch him then.  Makes you wonder why they had a child.  Plus, I think I'd only be able to handle taking 2 or 3 kids since R has activities all summer long.  But, honestly, I hate the idea of it.  I hate even more the fact that I have to work right now - when it seems so hard with an only child who already cries when I mention working because she's afraid I won't have much time for her.  And the truth is, I won't have that much time for her - not like in the past.  It just sucks.  If we lived some place cheaper, a state that doesn't kill you to live there, we'd have been okay with me staying home.    Okay, that's the scared, whiny part.  On the other hand, I'm really grateful to have the contacts that I do and the help from people that I do.  I've gotten quite a bit of help today with calls.  Two of the insurance agents I called where completely helpful and nice about talking to me, giving me numbers to call where transcription is done for them.  Then the women from church who had so many ideas and suggestions for me.  Then one of those women and another contact my hairdresser gave me checking into other possible job situations for me with people they know.  I'm getting a lot of help here.  And I'm very grateful for that.  I've been praying so hard for help with making this happen.  It's hard to look for work that allows you to stay home, plus that you have no experience in.  I just have to have faith that something will come up for me, one way or the other.  Until then, we'll have to muddle through our financial mess.  Yuck.  It sucks.  And I'm getting sick again, dang it!  I can't wait until J has his surgery on June 16th.  He gets colds very easily because of his sinus problems and then passes them on to R and I.  Because of our asthma, we have the breathing complications.  I'm using my nebulizer 4-6 times a day right now.  It's awful not to be able to breathe, as anyone with asthma can attest to.  And frustrating to be sick so frequently.    Anyway, I need a short nap, then it will probably be time to get R from school.

      Looking at my journal, I realized I've missed a number of days writing my gratitude journal.  I haven't done that since the 18th!  I don't know what made me forget it.  It always feels so good to write those things out.  Anyway, I'll do one for today to cover some of those days.  Maybe I'll add a few extra to cover - lol.  1.  I am grateful for old friends and visits to my hometown.  It was great to see people I used to know and interesting to see the few changes that have occurred in the town I grew up in.  Not so different from when I lived there, more than 20 years ago.  Oh, okay - it was almost 25 years ago!  lol.  2.  I am grateful that my best friend is married to someone who treats her well and really loves her, rather than possesses her and that J and her hubby, W, get along so well.  They are both professional truck drivers and have a lot in common.  And W is social, where as G was not (and was a self-centered, abusive jerk).  3.  I am grateful for cooler weather today and the rain we so desperately need in this state.  It's only in the low 60's today and our state has been in a drought for several years now, so we need every bit of rain willing to fall on us.  4.  I am grateful for the kids at R's school because I love being there and listening to them.  I love working with them, having them read to me, the way the come over for hugs and to hold my hand and talk.  I love that R is proud that her momma gets to be there, too.   5.  I am grateful for how well R reads now, when at the beginning of the year, I was worried about her level.  Now, she reads amazingly well and I love to have her read books to me, too.  6.  I am grateful for where my life has taken me.  All my life I wanted to be a mother and wife and now I have those great blessings.  I love every bit of it.  But I also miss R being a baby, holding her in my arms.  Of course, she will never be too big to sit on my lap or to cuddle.    7.  I am grateful for R's teacher who has taught R so much this year and made her feel loved, smart and special and who gave me a plant today for all the help I've given at school all year.  Oh, how I'll miss working there this summer.   8.  I am grateful for the refocus I'm working on toward getting healthy and exercising again.  I'm grateful I have all those wonderful low cal, low fat recipes I've collected over the past 4 years or so, too.  They keep me satisfied with what I'm eating.  9.  I am grateful for other people who struggle with weight issues and have the courage to share their struggles, success and actions with others who learn from them.  Okay, that's a few, I guess.  I sort of feel a little more caught up - lol.

      I just finished watching Dr. Phil's show (well, about 40 minutes ago) and I cried through the whole darn thing.  It was the finale for the Ultimate Weight Loss Challenge group and these people have done an amazing job!  I don't usually get to see his show because just as it's coming on, I'm heading out the door to pick R up from school.  But J is home tonight (unusual on this day of the week) and he said he'd go pick her up for me.  So that was what I chose to do and watch.  When J and R got home, we went to the kitchen and threw out the few things we had in the house that are crap - some cookies, some chocolate covered breakfast bars, some Peeps left over from Easter, a bag of this and that sweet stuff.  That was the only junk in the house, but for me, it has indicated that we could buy more to replace it.  Now that it's gone, we've all resolved to not replace it.  I'm pulling out my extensive low cal, low fat recipe collection and I'm writing out some menus.  I haven't done that in a long time.  And I'm posting my menus to my e-mail group.  I'm also going to post what I'm reading in Dr. Phil's book and my reaction to those things (which I'll probably duplicate here).  I am a strong believer in weight problems being more about what's happening in our heads - our emotions, our feelings toward ourselves, our feelings about things that have happened in our past, our poor level of self-esteem, our inability to forgive ourselves and those we interact with, etc., than it is about what we're putting in our mouths every day.  Feeding our emotions - what becomes for us the act of putting food in our mouths - is complicated by our inability to cope with our feelings appropriately.  We have to find the 'key' to changing those feelings.  I think we do that by learning to cope with our feelings, our emotions, in another way.  When I'm frustrated or stressed, I should be exercising that tension out of my body.  Not feeding it food so that the destructive behavior continues to diminish me emotionally and enlarge me physically.  When I'm bored, lonely, worried - I should get on the phone to a friend (or the computer to chat with someone), find one of my 'incompleted' hobbies and finish it, talk out how I'm feeling to someone, etc.    So, what's so hard about those concepts?  I don't know.  I guess it takes practice.  It takes loving ourselves enough to do it.  It takes having the courage to change ourselves, even when it means we enter into the unknown - how people will interact with us, how our spouses will feel, how our bodies may not look perfect (I fear hanging skin in some places - although I hear toning can prevent the bulk of that).  So many things to put away.  I need to just focus on the end goal - health, fitness, being an example to my child and husband, feeling better emotionlly.  All these things do come with weight loss and all these things are real.  Today, I will stop half doing the healthy thing.  Today I will stop whining about having to get up at 5 a.m. to get my workouts in.  Today I will go to bed at a decent hour so I can get up at 5 a.m. and tonight as I go to bed, I will tell myself how strong I really am, how capable I am, how much I really want to be thin and healthy.  I will set my menus and my first small goals tonight.  I will pray for strength and commitment from myself to accomplish this important act that must go on for the rest of my life.  This is it.  This must be it.  And I'll share this with anyone bored enough, crazy into reading blogs enough, stuck with me enough, to have to go along with me - lol.

      Well, yesterday (Saturday) was my birthday!  I had a great day.  We've had this incredibly busy weekend, though.  Friday night was R's Brownie's ceremony - where they get all their badges and such.  R was the troop flag carrier.  She did a great job!  Then my good friend, one of my best friends, K, called and asked to take me to breakfast Sat. morning for my birthday.  I don't know if every town is like this, but here, if you want a place to eat without waiting for an hour or more, you have to go at off times.  So, we went at about 7 a.m.!  No sleeping in yesterday!  lol.  It was great, though.  She gave me a beautiful photo album.  The card was a total crack up - making reference to our age, of course - lol.  And we talked and laughed the whole time.  Then R and I went to the church for a Primary (kid's Sunday School) activity.  The kids wrote letters and drew pictures for the soldiers in Iraq.  We're also sending a big package with sunglasses and candy for kids (the soldiers like to give them to the Iraqi children), beef jerkey, Pringles (because they're in the can and stay whole), anti-bacterial soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc.  K's husband is there, working as a civilian, so he's helping pass it out.  The kid's also made patriotic pinwheels for themselves and they got to dip big stick pretzels in melted candy and coat them in red, white and blue sprinkles and stars.  They had a great time.  After that, R and I ran to the store for some stuff.  J had not yet had time to take her to get me a card or anything, so as we walked in, she saw a huge display of flowers and it was a 10 for $10 sale at Albertson's, so she wanted to get me some pink carnations.  After she picked them out, she held them and said, "Pretend like you don't know what I got."  LOL.  As we were leaving, she saw the cards and asked to pick one out.  I let her and peeked down the aisle to see how she was doing.  She was in the Father's Day cards.  When I told her, she said, "No wonder they all say Dad and Daddy!"  lol.  I showed her where the HB Mom cards were and she picked one out and hid it from me.  She was so happy to have something to give me!  It was so cute!  When J got home, he got a card for me, then grilled some pork chops, made baked potatoes and salad.  He bought a small cake, too.  They brought it out with the 43 switched around to read 34 and R said, "Gee, isn't there something wrong with this number?" or something to that effect - lol.  It was cute.  They sang HB very off-key and I loved every second of it!  It was a great day!  Today, we headed out to my home town to see my best friend's daughter graduate.  It was strange because one of the people handing out scholarships in his deceased father's name was a grown man with a beard whom I'd babysat when he was 2 years old!!  Oh my gosh, I was feeling my age - LOL.  Learned about some other people I used to know when we lived there, too.  It was interesting.  But it's been about 25 years since I was in that school and it was hard to remember where things were, family names from back then - although many families still live there, etc.  Oh, and I saw a teacher from when I was in school.  He doesn't teach there anymore - does something else - but I called out to him and he remembered me and my younger sister, K.  I called to tell my sister he said "hi" tonight and to catch her up on stuff, too.  It was really great to see L, my best friend, and to watch her daughter, H, graduate.  And nice that L's second husband and J can relate and talk to each other with such ease.  They are both professional truck drivers.  L's first husband, G, was a jerk.  He was abusive and a bit psycho, but she stayed for almost 19 years because of her kids.  Neither J nor I could stand him.  Now she's with a really good man who treats her great!  They've been married a year, but together for about 3.    I registered R for the swim team for this summer today.  She's very excited about it.  Her private swim instructor also does the swim team and he wanted her on it this year.  She's doing great with her swimming.  And she loves it.  She's quite a fish!  lol.  As we headed home from my home town, we passed an old, run down house we lived in when I was growing up.  It was a horrible place then, too.  Our home had burned to the ground and we had to find a place fast.  The only place around was this dump of a farm house which was 2 miles West of town.  I remember one time one of our cats brought in a mouse it hadn't killed yet and released it.  We had this old fashioned chair - the kind that rock and swivel (I don't think they make them anymore) and I jumped up in that, screaming my head off.  My mom and sister both ran to the dining room and jumped on chairs, but as my sister passed me, she bumped the chair I was in.  So, screaming (all of us), I was spinning around and around.  Just then, my mom's best friend (who has since passed away) came walking in, there to have breakfast with us.  She'd lived on farms all her life.  She put her hands on her hips and said, "What is going on in here?"  We screamed, "A mouse!  A mouse!"  She said, "Oh, for Pete's sake!" and got the broom and beat the mouse to death, then brushed it out the door - LOL.  She rolled her eyes at us!  We were the pathetic city people afraid of an ity, bity mouse!  LOL.  And when we first moved in there, I chose a room that had been an enclosed porch at one time.  The roof needed a repair and about 4 days after we settled in, I woke to a rain storm and water just pouring into my bedroom!  lol.  What a dump.  But funny, looking back on it now.          I'm worn to a frazzle, so I'm off to bed. Peace.

      I was talking to some mom's at school today, waiting for the kids to be let out, and I told the story about when we were in the Denver International Airport when R was about 4 years old and she needed to go potty.  While J waited for us on the other side of the terminal, where we would be boarding, R and I crossed the walkway and went in.  She was amazed by the 'magic' potty and sink.  So much so, that when we came out of the door, she could hardly wait to tell about it.  Across the walkway she yelled out, "Guess what, Daddy?  They have magic potties and sinks here!"  There was a low roar of laughter throughout the airport because her little, high voice just echoed off all the walls and high ceilings.  LOL.    If only we could all see magic so easily.

      Sometimes, we have to work to forgive someone for something.  Sometimes we don't really feel like they deserve that forgiveness.  But, of course, they do.  As we all do.  And I've always found it easier to forgive others rather than myself.  I had someone to forgive recently and today, I can say with certainty, I have forgiven them.  Usually, I can do that pretty quickly, but this person kept hurting other people I care about and that made it harder.  I don't think I'll ever think as well of her again, but I hold no grudge toward her for her failing. It's a relief to have been able to put that away in my heart, too.  As for forgiving ourselves, I think that's always a tough one.  For me, anyway, I tend to be very hard on myself, on my expectations of myself.  And I think it's hard to put behind us errors we have made - whether toward ourselves or others.  But I think forgivness is a healing of the heart that we all must come to in order to go forward in our lives.  Whether we must forgive ourselves or others, we must still forgive.  I'm reading a wonderful book called The Miracle of Forgiveness by Spencer W. Kimball.  He was the prophet and president of my church when I first joined until his death in 1985.  He was a sweet, kind-hearted, soft spoken little man who had suffered through throat cancer and surgery and could barely speak.  He was blessed with regaining his voice, though.  However, when he spoke, his voice was so soft you had to listen carefully and be very quiet.  Not such a bad thing, I think.  One of the quotes in his book is:     The greatest of all faults is to be conscious of none. - Carlyle.  We cannot make others see their faults - nor should we.  But we can certainly look into our own souls, our own hearts, and see what faults lie there.  Then, we can begin to change them.  And the scriptures give us guidelines along this, as well.  In Proverbs 6:16-19 we are told the Lord hates 7 particular things:  A proud look, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, a false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.  Of course, there is much more in the scriptures to reference about this subject.       Anyway, it seems easy to fall into some of these if we aren't aware of our actions and place them on a simple level of what Christ would have done had He been in our shoes.  I hope, one day, to always look at things in my life in that manner, because although I look often at things in this way, sometimes it is after a word has left my mouth (or been typed and sent) and I cannot take it back.  Some of the things listed very few people would ever knowingly do - like to shed innocent blood, be a false witness, devise wicked imaginations......  Well, this whole post came about, I guess, because it took me some time to forgive this last person.  So I've had forgiveness on my mind a lot.  I pulled this book out that I partially read years ago to remind me of how important forgiveness is for us all.

      I spent what seems like the whole day at R's school today.  I went in with her this morning and worked in the 'wet room' - called such because there is a sink in there - where all the cutouts and such are done.  At 9:30, they had their Olympus Parade, where each class had made a banner and a pretend name of their "nation".  R's was Penguinland.  Of course, R's penguin had a word bubble - apparently indicating it talks all the time like my child does - lol.  Hers was the only one with such.  Anyway, it was cute and they did a symbolic running of the torch with some of the 5th graders.  Then the kids got their pictures taken with their banners and teacher.  R begged me to stay for lunch, which was obviously hours away, but since she'd been asking for weeks, I stayed.  G, the mom I always work with at school, stayed and we did a bunch of work for next year - lol.  We've worked so much for them that next year's moms won't have all that much to do!  lol.  After that, I went outside as they had a recess and then into language arts with her.  Finally, it was lunch time.  I realized I am an old lady when I started to fall asleep in language arts.  Or maybe it's just because I knew the answers?  lol.  I was worn out when I got home.  I've got a busy week ahead of me and I have a list of places to call for possible jobs that I need to get to.  Geez, I'm so scared about that.  All my previous jobs have always fallen into my lap.  I've never even done a formal interview until the one I did - too early - for this career a few months back when I hadn't even finished the course yet.  I did a terrible job, is what the truth is.  I was nervous and shaking and could hardly think to answer questions.  I wouldn't have offered me a job, but she offered to work with me after I finished schooling.  Only full time, though.  But I'm only going to work part time because I can't get R to her activities otherwise and I want my child to know more than what I look like from the back!    On to my gratitude journal for today:  1.  I am grateful for the kids at R's school.  It's a wonderful feeling to have them come up and hug me, want to sit by me at lunch, want to read to me, to see them light up when I tell them hi, etc.  It's really wonderful and fills my heart.  2.  I am grateful for the miracle of forgiveness - that which we can give others and that which, with more difficulty it seems, we can give ourselves.  Forgiving can be hard to do, but it's also necessary and provides an amazing freedom to us.  3.  I am grateful for our new bed, which is a king size, and a 3-chamber air filled for my back.  It's helped my back pain tremedously.  4.  I am grateful for my e-mail group and the wonderful women who belong to it.  They are supportive and loving in an unfailing way and always have been.  5.  I am grateful for Wednesday mornings when J will often take R to school for me and I get to sleep in until 7:30!

      Walked R this morning to school, back home and then picked her up this afternoon and we walked home again.  Felt good to walk some.  It's about 15-20 minutes each way.  We plan to walk this whole week, weather permitting.  Not a lot to say tonight.  I'm just tired.  But wanted to post my gratitude journal:  1.  I am grateful for family, even those who do not always seem close to me, as they are a tie to history.  And for those who are close to me for all that they share with me.  2.  I am grateful for each new day - that I am able to rise from my bed and walk where I want to, that I may do what I need to do and desire to do because I am blessed with a sound body.  3.  I am grateful for our pets.  Our dog helps J's mental health as well as protects us and plays with R when she is lonely for a playmate.  Our cat reminds me to sit and relax when she climbs in my lap and I rock her (like a little baby!).  They make us laugh and keep us on our toes!  4.  I am grateful for the people in my life who show honesty, a trait I think is extraordinarily important and flows into other important traits on a moral plane.    5.  I am grateful for people I have known who are not honest, or perhaps not so upstanding, because they teach me that there will always be people out there who need others to show them through example what goodness and decency is.  In the words of George Albert Smith, his personal creed, "I would not seek to force people to live up to my ideas, but rather love them into doing the thing that is right."       Speaking of George Albert Smith, I love his personal creed and have it hanging on my desk cabinet wall.  I posted the whole creed back on April 17, 2004.  So, I won't do that again.  But it's a favorite.  I really don't have much else to say tonight.  I'm worn out.  Heading to bed now.

      You know how sometimes you just think if one more thing happens, it will be all you can take and you'll lose your sanity and all your control and be miserable, life will never be the same again?  Then, suddenly, that darkness just gets lifted?  Sometimes, it's because of the actions of others (as it has been lately), sometimes it's because of faith (which always plays a part) and sometimes it's hearing a loved one laugh and be filled with joy.  Well, I've been lucky enough to have all three recently.  Saturday, we had R's Spring Fling party.  All told, we'd invited 7 girls and 5 were able to make it.  Pretty good when it's soccer season, dance recitals are about to begin, etc.  The girls had such a good time!  They played and laughed and danced to music and played dress-up.  They had homemade pizza for lunch (and all voted my homemade pizza the best they'd ever eaten - initiated by R - LOL) and a castle cake that they were all excited over.  From 11-2, I danced with them, ran around monitoring the dog, keeping them downstairs so I wouldn't have to reclean my entire house, watching one of the more manipulative, ornery girls even more closely than the others (my gosh, that one is so sneaky and running around trying to start things between girls - the little booger), serving them food, etc.  Finally, at around 1 p.m., one of the girls mentioned we hadn't watched a movie yet.  And yep, you could easily guess, it was a Barbie movie.  Barbie in Swan Lake to be specific.  That quieted 3 girls and then R and 2 others were off getting into trouble (the sneaky one was with this group, of course).  They all had a great time, though, after they left, I promptly went up to bed and slept for over an hour!  lol.  What a day.  But I loved hearing them laughing, playing, being creative, just enjoying life!   My kids in my Sunday School class are preparing (most of them, anyway) to turn 12 years old and start going to the young men's and young women's Sunday School group.  You know, no longer with "the babies".  lol.  It's hard to focus kids this age, to help them 'feel the Holy Spirit' as we go over lessons they've been learning all their lives.  Last year, with my roudy group of 5 boys, I landed on a great idea.  I had each of them teach a lesson from the lesson book.  I copied it for them, added a cover letter and assured them they could call me for help and/or their parents would help them prepare the lesson, too.  The cover letter tells them to begin with a prayer that they might understand the lesson and be able to teach it well.  It had an amazing effect on my boys last year.  This year, I've watch all 5 boys honorably pass the sacrament every Sunday.  The first time all 5 of them stood together to do this, I cried.  It touched my heart to see them so grown up, so spiritually prepared.  Today, B in my current class, taught the lesson.  He did a remarkable job.  He's sort of my......well, we call him Monkey Boy because he has a thing about monkeys and sometimes answers spiritual questions with monkey facts or comments - ahem.  lol.  But today, you could see in his mannerisms, his face, that he had spiritually prepared the lesson.  It was really nice to see.  I challenged the other kids to top B's success  :)   I'm looking forward to some very interesting weeks ahead.  And for whatever reason, they are thrilled that they 'get' to bring their own treat for the class when the teach (except cake or cupcakes since they're cumbly and messy).  I've decided to add to my blog a gratitude journal.  I read, sadly only all the way through one year, Simple Abundance by Sarah Ban Breathnach.  It's a wonderful book and helped me so much that year when things were extremely difficult for me - my self esteem at an all time low.  I wrote a gratitude journal that entire year, 5 items every day.  It helped me to still love my husband, to begin to like myself and in many other ways.  It filled my heart in the same way prayer does.  So, I thought I'd begin that again.  Now, there are days I don't post in my blog - those days I'll write it on paper here at home.  But I feel like it's a really good idea for me right now.  So, here are my first 5:  1.  I am grateful for my faith - that the truthfulness of the gospel was testified to me by the Holy Spirit and God is never failing toward us.  2.  I am grateful for my daughter, who fills my heart, taught me how to truly love something beyond imagination, holds her father and I together sometimes when things aren't so good, and who makes me laugh and smile and is a gift from God to me.  3.  I am grateful for my friends (both here and in cyberland) who support me in every way I could ever need them to, who allow me to be a support to them, who bless me with the sharing of their hearts and minds, and who allow me to be who and what I am and love me anyway (or in spite of it-lol).  4.  I am grateful for my husband whose presence in my life, while sometimes a challenge, teaches me to be a better person, uplifts me when he can, loves me even when I'm not sure he does or when I am, perhaps, not at my most lovable, looks into his own heart and soul even though it is painful and not typical for most men and who continues to work hard to be well and accomplish the things he desires in his life (like working full time and fitting in 11-13 hours of schooling a week, too, without quitting).    5.  I am grateful for the ability to get up every day in a country where I am free to worship as I wish, speak what I wish and protect myself in the manner I see fit because brave men and women in the armed forces, throughout hundreds of years, have stood beneath our American flag with courage and commitment, even when those at home fail them in their hearts.  Tonight I've had many things pass through my mind.  Sunday's often make me reflective.  I am truly blessed and I need to remember that. Peace.

      I actually typed something quick up earlier today but it didn't take when the page gave me an error.  Oh well.  How important could it have been?  lol.  I watched the Carol Burrnett special last night.  Oh my gosh, I laughed and laughed!  And I remember our family watching her show every week.  I loved it when she did her Q & A stuff and that's what the special was all about.  Funny, talented lady!  A few weeks ago, in the car on our way home from school, R said, "Oh, Mamma?  I've been planning a party for a few weeks now."  lol.  I told her it was a good thing she let me in on it since I'd have to arrange it all and made sure she hadn't already invited people.  Well, we've got 7 girls we invited and all but one are coming.  I really expected 4 or 5, trying to just keep it an even number in the end, but R had other girls she wanted to invite.  So, we made extra invitations.  I used some scrapbook paper, ribbon, punches of butterflies, flowers, balloons and music notes and typed up the info.  We glued them all in place and they were really cute!  It's just a Spring Fling party.  I'm making homemade pizza and the girls will listen to Kidz Bop music, dance, paint their finger and toe nails, play games, watch a movie - just girly, fun stuff.  It's on Saturday.  R and I are making the famous, 1st place castle cake again, too.  I've spent most of today cleaning and will finish that up tomorrow, plus bake the cakes as it's two 8 x 13's stacked.  It should be fun, though.  I know R and her friends will have a blast and all but 2 of the girls are new to come over to play, so that opens more girls to make play dates with this summer.  I hope I'm helping R learn how to have many good, close friends so that she always has someone to be there for her, too.  J has finally been catching on to his math for school.  It's such a relief for him....and me - lol.  He's feeling so much better about things.  And he told me today that he really feels like he's ready to start getting healthy - as a family.  That's so nice to hear and I hope he can actual pursue that now with me.  It's so much easier when everyone in the family is working on it.  I talked to R about her weight gain, just told her to look at her tummy and remember that she can run faster, play more and would feel better if she was more careful with what she eats and exercises a little more.  So, tonight, she asked if she could do her kids workout tape.  It's a really hokey 80's workout for kids called Junior American Workout that my older sister had for her boys and passed on to me, but she likes it and I encourage her.  She did really well and finished it before she quit today - a first.  Usually she poops out before it's halfway through.  I was proud of her.  I've been working with R to help her prepare to stay overnight on a Girl Scout outing next month.  I can't go because of my back.  I really can't sleep on the floor or I'd be a cripple.  Even with an air mattress, because they aren't shaped very well, would leave me that way.  But one of the leaders is pretty close to her - handles my dramatic, sometimes difficult child very well - and she's going to let R sleep beside her.  I tried to arrange a sleepover before this, but with no family nearby and her being at an age when most girls are just starting to have sleepovers, I couldn't get it worked out.  But I told her if she doesn't stay, 1. she doesn't get her badge and 2. she won't get to sleepover for at least a year with any friends til I can trust her to handle it.  I think she'll probably make it.  I sweetened the deal by telling her I'd give her whatever quarters she needed to fill up a $5.00 savings thing she has for quarters.  She's only got $2 so far.  If that's filled before then, which I doubt as she gets paid for special things like staying in her own bed all night and doing certain 'big girl' chores, neither of which she tends to do - lol, I'll give her something additional.  Maybe buy the My Little Pony she's been wanting for so long - Kimono.  We'll see.  And wouldn't you know?  We shut off our furnace about 3 days ago and 2 days ago it snowed!  lol.  I'm being bullheaded, though, and am not turning it on!  It's been a balmy 62 degrees in here - lol!  Tomorrow is supposed to warm up to 60 something.  It's so wierd - we had mid to upper 80's weather for about a week, then the next day, it was snowing and in the low 30's - 40's!  Crazy weather here.  But, that's the amazing thing about this state, too.    Well, I best get to bed.  I've got a lot going on tomorrow.  Thankfully, J will be home to help with a few things and will pick R up from school for me.  I should be able to finish everything in time.  Sigh.......

      Well, well, well.  Blogger's got a new look.  Nice.  Here I am, a headach coming on, having spent part of the day crying on hubby's shoulder.  Job hunting when you're new to a field really sucks.  Finances suck.  Sometimes people you thought cared about you suck - and you find out how self-centered their world is.  You know the type - I'm okay.  You are not.  Ever.  Blah.  And then I've been wondering why I haven't felt so happy in a while.  Up and down on the moods.  Hormones?  No.  Stresses?  Somewhat.  Blood sugars?  HUH?  What do you mean blood sugars?  What are those and why should I worry about them?  Yeah, so what?  I'm a diabetic?  What's that got to do with anything?  Hmmmmmmm, well let me tell you.  High blood sugar, especially over a long period of time, can do a number on your moods.  It can cause (or if you already have it, heighten) depression.  It can make you snap at your little child because she's off in her own world and doesn't 'really' hear you the fourth time you ask her to do something.  It can make you think your spouse doesn't love you because he's busy working and going to school and when he gets home, just now and then, he just needs to shower and go to bed.  It can make you feel like the dog is out to get you when you trip on a chew toy.  Or that the cat doesn't love you anymore because last night she slept on the 'cooler' bathroom floor instead of with you.  Okay, these are extremes, but they could happen and do, to a lesser extent, for me.    Today I had an appointment with my endocrinologist.  I didn't want to go all weekend.  I mentioned to my husband that I wanted to cancel, reschedule for later in the month.  But I knew I needed to go and that we had to do something.  And we did.  He put me on insulin.  We'll be slowly reducing the oral meds until I'm only on a once a day shot of Lantus.  I felt defeated.  I felt I had failed myself and.....oh I don't know, everyone else, I guess.  But I got home and had that good cry that I've probably been needing for several weeks, and I realized that this had a positive side, too - just as things do.  Once my sugars are under control, my mood will improve.  I won't be as sleepy as I've been, so I won't need naps almost every day.  I won't have as hard a time getting up, so maybe I can get started on working out at 5 a.m. again.  I'll have the drive and the rightness of mind to exercise and eat healthy again.  And I'll have this great desire to get off the shots (because I'm a huge needle freak - they terrify me!).  I think it could easily be said that this is just what I needed.    And I can stop lying to myself that I'm doing well and my diabetes is in control when it clearly isn't to anyone who knew I was scared to test it every day.  Just what the Dr. ordered......  Mother's Day was nice.  J bar-b-qued steak, made baked potatoes (this is awful and I only have it once or twice a year, but I like them rolled in salt - not a lot, just enough) and some bread.  No veggies.  I think at one point he asked me if I wanted salad while I was on the phone, but we didn't have any veggies.  We also had chips and several dips earlier in the day.  What a terrible eating weekend!  But it was nice not to have to cook and clean up.  J did all that.  R made me some beautiful things, she did them all week long and a couple of them last week.  So sweet.  I love those kinds of gifts - handmade, from the heart.  It was wonderful.  And Mother's Day cards from J, R and my parents.  Mother's Day is my favorite holiday - because of what it means to me to be a mom and how long I waited to be one.  It was a nice weekend.

      This morning, around 10:30 a.m., my phone rang.  Caller ID told me it was the school.  The voice on the other end asked if I was me.  "Yes it is."  "Do you know who this is?" she said with assurance.  "Yes.  It's Nurse F," I replied.  "So how sick is she?"  Yep, R is sick again with the same thing I have, it seems.  Apparently, her immune system is on furlough.  I can only hope it returns sometime soon, hopefully before next year when it's not 'just first grade'.  And my child is not an easy, oh I'll just lay down and rest and watch TV kind of kid.  She's the dramatic, cry out at random, cover her mouth every time until she's on my lap kind of kid.  lol.  But, she's my baby and I just want her to be well.  So I'll sit with her, give her medicine and plenty of liquids (on a miserably hot day like today - a whopping 87 degrees record - I'll give her lots of pedialite pops from the freezer) and read to her, play quietly with her and tell her that no, even though she is sick, it is not an open door on whining or sassing!  She came home with homework and I made her do it right away and there is no school tomorrow, so we're set for the weekend.  Daddy is off to school and then work tonight, but he'll be home tomorrow to give me a break (after he has a nap) if I'm ready to run into the streets screaming 'sanctuary' - lol.  And if she's worse tomorrow, we'll see the Dr.  I, on the other hand, was feeling better.  It seemed by infection was resolving itself.  But now it's back and forth so I suspect I will ultimately end up at the Dr.'s for my own TLC, too.  Of course, it's in my lungs causing my asthma to flare up.  I really get frustrated with that, too.  Yuck.  And my baby has it, too.  It stinks!  On a brighter note, for there always is one, I have finally completed making my first leather book cover for my dad for a gift.  It was actually due in Feb - lol.  But, with school and my own family, I simply had no time.  It's done today, though, and I'll mail it off tomorrow to him.  He uses it almost like a purse - lol.  Everything he needs to take with him goes inside it - checkbook, notes, directions, Dr. appointment info, etc.  So he wears them out about every year and I've made them from that plastic mesh stuff and yarn previously.  But I hope the leather will last more than a year as regular material didn't even make it a full year.  He is a man who always reads books, so it gets LOTS of use.  He is the one that instilled the love of books in his kids.  Well, one of my brothers doesn't read much, but all the rest of us do.  Especially all 3 of we girls.  Which causes me to recall a wonderful series of books by Jan Karon - The Mitford Series.  If you enjoy reading and appreciate what I call 'good books' - meaning not filled with filth - you will love them.  Right now I'm reading an interesting book called The Stone Diaries.  I'm about 1/2 way through and I've quite enjoyed it so far.    I finally got some groceries in the house.  Our cupboards had become bare!  I got all good, healthy, cool to eat foods - fruits, veggies, 100% whole wheat bread for sandwiches, etc.  Tomorrow, we go to the grocery store where we DON'T buy any produce because it's terrible there but everything else is cheaper.  Then we'll get everything else we need.  I'm working hard to only shop once a month or so.    For Mother's Day, I asked J to grill some steaks I've had in the freezer for about 2 months!  Our money is tight, so I'm perfectly happy with dinner here as long as he does ALL the prep and cooking and finishes up the dishes.  He's game, so I'm happy.  R made me at least 4 things for Mother's Day, too.  It's my favorite holiday because I waited so long to be a mother and R has been such a great joy in my life.  It was a day that used to be a very sad one for me.  Not having felt my childhood to be a very good one, it hasn't been one that I got excited about.  Then, I had R and my life changed for the better and I came to know what is meant by unconditional love for someone - that is what R has from me.  And, I'm beginning to strongly believe, it's what J has from me, too.  It feels good to be able to give that kind of love to someone.    Well, I might pop in here for another post tonight - or not - lol.  I'm enjoying having the time to post whenever the mood strikes me.  To be a writer for a living - now that would be my dream!  Too bad it's not very realistic - lol.

      A friend of my husband's, and just an all around good guy, sent me this for Mother's Day and I wanted to hang on to it.  So I shared it with a few people, printed it up and saved it in my e-mail.  Thought I'd post it here, too because of how it made me feel.  Reading it, I cried, thinking about how much I love my daughter and what a great joy she is in my life.  It also made me mourn for the mother's who have lost their children, under whatever circumstance - the mother's in Afghanistan and Iraq and all the other countries war torn and weary.  And in our own country, where violence continues to go on and rise.  And so every day, I thank God that my baby is safe and with me.  This is what Art sent to me:  HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY This is for the mothers who have sat up all night with sick toddlers in their arms, wiping up barf laced with Oscar Mayer wieners and cherry Kool-Aid saying, "It's okay Honey, Mommy's here."  Who have sat in rocking chairs for hours on end soothing crying babies who can't be comforted.  This is for all the mothers who show up at work with spit-up in their hair and milk stains on their blouses and diapers in their purse.  For all the mothers who run carpools and make cookies and sew Halloween costumes. And all the mothers who DON'T.  This is for the mothers who gave birth to babies they'll never see.  And the mothers who took those babies and gave them homes.  This is for the mothers whose priceless art collections are hanging on their refrigerator doors.  And for all the mothers who froze their buns on metal bleachers at football or soccer games instead of watching from the warmth of their cars.  And that when their kids asked, "Did you see me, Mom?" they could say, "Of course, I wouldn't have missed it for the world," and mean it.  This is for all the mothers who yell at their kids in the grocery store and swat them in despair when they stomp their feet and scream for ice cream before dinner. And for all the mothers who count to ten instead, but realize how child abuse happens.  This is for all the mothers who sat down with their children and explained all about making babies.  And for all the (grand)mothers who wanted to, but just couldn't find the words.  This is for all the mothers who go hungry, so their children can eat.  For all the mothers who read "Goodnight, Moon" twice a night for a year. And then read it again. "Just one more time."  This is for all the mothers who taught their children to tie their shoelaces before they started school. And for all the mothers who opted for Velcro instead.  This is for all the mothers who teach their sons to cook and their daughters to sink a jump shot.  This is for every mother whose head turns automatically when a little voice calls "Mom?" in a crowd, even though they know their own offspring are at home -- or even away at college.  This is for all the mothers who sent their kids to school with stomachaches, assuring them they'd be just FINE once they got there, only to get calls from the school nurse an hour later asking them to please pick them up. Right away.  This is for mothers whose children have gone astray, who can't find the words to reach them.  For all the mothers who bite their lips until they bleed when their 14 year olds dye their hair green.  For all the mothers of the victims of recent school shootings, and the mothers of those who did the shooting.  For the mothers of the survivors, and the mothers who sat in front of their TVs in horror, hugging their child who just came home from school, safely.  This is for all the mothers who taught their children to be peaceful, and now pray they come home safely from a war.  What makes a good Mother anyway? Is it patience? Compassion? Broad hips? The ability to nurse a baby, cook dinner, and sew a button on a shirt, all at the same time? Or is it in her heart? Is it the ache you feel when you watch your son or daughter disappear down the street, walking to school alone for the very first time?  The jolt that takes you from sleep to dread, from bed to crib at 2 A.M. to put your hand on the back of a sleeping baby?  The panic, years later, that comes again at 2 A.M. when you just want to hear their key in the door and know they are safe again in your home?  Or the need to flee from wherever you are and hug your child when you hear news of a fire, a car accident, a child dying?  The emotions of motherhood are universal and so our thoughts are for young mothers stumbling through diaper changes and sleep deprivation... And mature mothers learning to let go.  For working mothers and stay-at-home mothers.  Single mothers and married mothers.  Mothers with money, mothers without.  This is for you all. For all of us...

      Haven't posted in a few days because I'm fighting off a sinus infection again.  Man, I hate these things, but I seem to get them with just about every cold I ever get.  I've been sleeping a lot and trying to hang in there until I can see the Dr.  Go too soon and I'll end up having to go 2 rounds of antibiotics.  So, I have to let it take hold.  Body achy and my right ear and cheekbones hurt, so I'm sure that's what I've got.    Needless to say, I've not finished the Spring cleaning because of getting sick.  This is what procrastination gets me.....lol.  Lesson learned.    On a good point, I'm still eating pretty well and slowly losing weight.  If I start working out, it will come off much more quickly - but I can't right now until I'm well.  I get the Weight Watchers e-mail newsletter and this week they had an article on a woman who lost 206 pounds!  I was facinated as it seems to speak to me more when someone has lost as much as I need to or more.  I think because it makes it more realistic for me.  Anyway, at 40 years of age, she rejoined WW, having tried all sorts of things over the years.  She'd even been to WW previously, tried shakes, prescription meds, hypnosis.  Nothing ever worked.  She says, "I became a yo-yo pro, easily losing up to 40 pounds, then gaining it all back.  I was basically eating myself to death, and at this point, I never, ever, ever thought I'd lose weight again.  And that's why I have to tell my story; if you recognize yourself here, this is for you."  Then she says this, "Why did Weight Watchers work for me this time?  All I can say is, my time had come.  One day, on the brink of desperation, I looked for divine help, and within two days I had found the motivation to return to Meetings, this time for good."  This statement from her struck me because that is exactly how I stopped smoking 14 years ago.  I worked in an environment where nearly everyone smoked and it took my friends some adjustment not to invite me constantly for a smoking break.  So the temptation was strong.  But I prayed for help every time I had a craving and it worked.  And, I had made up my mind - truely, completely.  Lately, I've been doing that with eating - not every time I want to eat, but every day, when I start my day.  I think there is a lot to be said for that Power being behind things we try to do in our lives.  One of the most impressive things I think she said was when she spoke about it taking a long time to lose all that weight, so she had time to make the WW plan second nature to her.  Even more profound, she spoke about how she ate out every week with a friend, her meetings buddy.  At first, they just ordered hamburgers without cheese or fries, but after around 9 months or so, they changed to plain baked potatoes and steamed broccoli.  She said that before, this would have screamed "deprivation" to her, but because her tastes had had time to change while on the WW program, she came to actually crave the simple, healthy foods.  This is something my e-mail group and I have discussed - giving your body and mind time to accept small, healthy changes over a period of time - weeks, months, whatever it requires.  She also mentioned the importance of journaling her menus and her feelings.  She lists the positives since losing her weight as all the things we who have a lot of weight to lose would also consider great changes - sliding comfortably into a booth at a restaurant; she mentioned her seatbelt, but for me it was a belt on an airplane; she mentioned tying her shoes, but for me it's painting my toes without having to hold my breath until I can sit up again.  Simple things for thin people, but embarrassing or difficult things for those with a lot of weight to lose.  These successes help us push onward, though.    There is a remarkable lady in my e-mail group who has lost over 160 pounds.  She still has over 100 to lose.  She is a great inspiration to me.  She has no support at home.  In fact, what she gets is harassment at her efforts.  Yet she continues to succeed.  And regain her health.  And move forward to better things in her life.  She's really amazing and an inspiration to us all.  Another woman in my group has lost her weight, about 50 pounds, and has maintained that loss for 4 years now!  She's already in a rare group of people who lose and keep their weight off, but in another year, her odds of maintaining her loss for life goes way, way up.  It helps give me hope and to realize that I can be in that small percentage of people, too, who lose it and keep it off for life.  She's an inspiration and a testiment to that fact.  The other women in my group are all at different stages in their journey.  But each of them is a support to me and, more importantly, a friend.  Each of them provides me with something that other people in my life have not or can not.  I love these women.  They mean a great deal to me and I hope one day we can all meet face to face - thin and healthy.  It's this sort of support that one needs in life - not just for getting healthy, but for sharing life's ups and downs, knowing someone cares, knowing you can say whatever you feel and that they will still be there, not passing judgement but just wanting what is best for you.  It's the kind of support I would wish we could all have in our lives.    Muhammad Ali said, "Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain.  It's not something you learn in school.  But if you haven't learned the meaning of friendship, you really haven't learned anything."    To each of my e-mail friends, thank you - more than I can express.  And to you, in the words of Ludwig van Beethoven:  "Never shall I forget the times I spent with you; continue to be my friend, as you will always find me yours."

      Went to see Hidalgo with our friends tonight.  It was a really good movie and based on a true story.  We went to Cinema Grill to see it.  Then the kids wanted to go to Dairy Queen to grab some dessert.  So, it's after 10 p.m. and R is still up because she wanted to watch Gargoyles before bed - lol.  But, on a sad note, we found out our friends have moved up the time they plan to move to Texas to this August instead of next summer.  I'm really sad.  K is pretty much one of my best friends and someone I 'hang out with' a lot.  I can't imagine them not being here and getting together almost every weekend.  I'm really sad about this, even though I know it will be best for them.  And I'll miss having her son in my Sunday School class, too, and seeing him advance to Young Men's.  It will be hard to see them go.   Earlier today, I took R and her best friend, S, swimming.  They had a great time and we stayed for about 2 hours.  Then came home and S stayed to play another 2 hours.  By then, we  needed to get ready to go to the movies, so she went home and R went into the shower to get that darn clorine out of her hair.  It's been a busy day as I cleaned while the girls were playing.  I'm worn out and still have clothes to iron for church tomorrow and to prepare my lesson.  Tomorrow, I'll be sure to do some relaxing.  Oh, and J's on a new shift starting this week.  That meant he was home tonight so we could all 3 go see this movie.  And it also means he won't be falling asleep during church - allegedly.  lol.

      I signed R up for the summer library reading program again.  I've done this for the last 3 or 4 years.  She loves it, it's a great program here and it's something special for us to do together.  Well, each summer, the library launches this program with a carnival-type event.  Then on Thursdays and some Saturdays, they have a variety of activities for the kids to come to.  We went to the puppet show on Saturday.  Today, we went to the Denver Zoo Wild Wonders show - at the library!  It was really good.  They had an opossum first, which is a nocturnal mammal and indigenous to Colorado.  It hid it's little face in the crook of the woman's arm that was holding it as she spoke about it.  Then they had two very noisy McCaws!  A green one and a blue one.  Beautful and I enjoyed looking at them because I knew they couldn't fly at me and I wasn't that close (plus, the '80's big hair is out) - lol.  We saw an alligator (baby, of course) and a small snake.  Oh, and how could I forget?  My favorite - a hissing cockroach - NOT!  lol.  They explained habitat to the kids and how our earth needs everything on it to continue.  The speakers were funny.  The exotic animals were cool.  It was fun and I'm impressed with how the library has gone out of the way to do some cool stuff like this for the kids - hoping it interests them in readings.  And R?  Well, she's reading a minimum of 1 hour mostly every day on her own and then we still read every night at bedtime, too.  She loves it.  She's discovered the magic of books.  I love that!  And I have printed up free worksheets and such from the internet and make her do school-related learning stuff for over an hour most days (except weekends).  I'm thinking my little angel is going to be all ready for school come August!

      There are times in my life when I have had a love affair, regardless of any other thing or person in my life.  It has happened off and on enough that I know it immediately when it begins to infect me.  It draws me to a place not well known by me since it comes and goes.  It leaves me needy in a way I'm not used to being and always wanting more.  It consumes my thoughts, usually beginning in the afternoon of every day of the week.  It frustrates me.  It embarrasses me.  It makes me feel inadequate and incapable.  And yet, every so often, it strikes me down in a way I can't explain.  That love affair is with sleep.  Most of the time in my life, I have lived on 4-6 hours of sleep every day.  For days on end.  Never getting more than that.  There were times in my life I couldn't sleep longer, even though I wanted to, needed to, because of my back pain getting so intense after laying down for 4 or 5 hours that I HAD to get up.  There were times when I was so overcome by my workaholism that I simply would not allow myself more sleep than that.  I mean, gee, where does the day go after 4 a.m.?  But I have fallen into that place where sleep is calling to me often.  My body tells me to go lay down, close my eyes, drift into the world of dreams and release all that tension, frustration, uncertainty, physical pain caused by being so tense.  Strange dreams that allow bursts of release of some sort fill my REM moments.  I know some people don't, so I'll tell you that I dream in color.  Vivid, detailed environments fill my dreams.  And strangers or caricatures of people I know swirl around me, interact with me, leave me behind until I somehow burst forth from all that holds me back.  I suppose it is a release that I can bring about any other way.  I suppose it is the way my body tries to recooperate after a lot of stress.  And I suppose it is a way my mind thinks it can gain control over those things that feel out of control in my life.  Then again, it could just be high sugars - lol.  No, I'm just very worn down but I can't rest because too much is going on too often.  So, even though it's only 9:30p.m., I think I'll go on to bed and let those weird thoughts and adventures cleanse my mind.

      If only I could work 5 days a week, I could actually organize my life a bit.  I'm frustrated.  I want to get started on working.  We have bills I need to take care of with my income.  I have a transcription machine to pay for, a couple of books, too.  But I can't seem to get work from my boss.  Not because she doesn't want me to work for her.  She likes my work.  She's just terribly unorganized.  She just took on a number of accounts and now she's just in a mess while she's been hiring and training new people.  She called me this morning, about a half hour before I was supposed to go to the office, and cancelled.  She hadn't gotten the tapes from the chiro she wants me to work on as he didn't have them there when she went to his office.  So now I'm supposed to get them tomorrow.  But I sort of feel like I'll believe it when I see it.  The hard part is that instead of dropping things and picking up at my front porch, which is how it's supposed to be eventually, I'm running back and forth.  Now that probably doesn't sound like a big deal since she's so close by, but if I think I'm going to her office in the morning and I haven't gotten up early enough to exercise, I rush to get ready to go.  Then I get a call not to come, but then I've already showered and everything and have the rest of my stuff to do, too, and DANG, no exercise.  It wouldn't be a big deal except that I'm a freak about being clean and I wouldn't leave the house to take R to swim team or run an errand without being showered, make up of some sort on and dressed decent.  That's just me.  But it's frustrating.  Hopefully, this will get worked out soon.  Because I really, really need to be able to schedule my day.  I'm a scheduler, dang it.  I need to be organized.  Okay, so the above paragraph explains that my exercise is lacking.  Thus, my eating isn't as good as it could be - although much, much better than the usual way I eat when I have an "I don't care" attitude.  But I know the result of this behavior when you add it all together - it means little to no weight loss and I'll have to really fight the urge to just forget about it.  So I have to sort it all out somehow.  That's got to be my focus.  Today ended up frustrating for other reasons, too.  R and J's computer, which R uses for CD ROM's and on-line games and J uses for some homework occasionally and games and e-mail, has been acting up a lot.  It's actually had some problems for a while.  I've done my best to keep it virus free by running and maintaining all the software on that.  But it's supposed to be J's job to maintain the rest.  However, he's been a bit bent out of shape that he "has to share with R...." but I get my own.  "Well," I explained, "I use mine for work - which was the plan when we bought it, a plan you came up with.  You and R use the one upstairs, I have this one for work.  That way, no clogging up, no hardware problems, etc."  He's been ticked about that.  And he's been doing all sorts of things he thinks he knows since he's been in school on the computer without worrying about the results.  However, he keeps having 'problems' with what he does and the computer issues became worse and worse.  R has a number of CD ROM's that suddenly don't work right anymore - they keep requesting they be reinstalled, over and over.  Once, when he decided he would separate the computer with one section for him and one for R, the side that was supposed to be R's was all corrupted and wouldn't even work at all!  He just left it.  So, when R called to me saying her computer wasn't working, I found this big mess and had to delete the separation.  However, since that time, the computer problems seem to have been getting worse and worse and he said something about it having pathways crossing or something.  I don't know.  He's totally out of his element.  He hasn't learned near enough to be handling this problem yet, but refuses to have someone come over and help us.  We know several people from church who are great with computers and have offered a number of times to come help us if we ever had computer problems.  So, right now, R can only play her on-line stuff.  Since the anti-virus isn't even running right as of tonight, though, I'm keeping her off it and keeping it shut off completely.  I don't know what he's done, but it's clearly even worse than it was.  I'm going to see if I can get someone from our church over here this weekend to look at it.  I don't know all the problems it's having, but I'll have to have J tell me or write them down.  We can't afford to put out the $100 he wants to for a 'new hard drive' and then somehow obtain Windows XP home addition to download on it.  There has to be another way to do this without totally erasing the whole computer and spending $300. on parts and software.  Or, his even worse idea, connect the two computers and tranfering all the info off mine onto it.  Cold day in hell first, buddy!!  Not with someone who has made the mess that thing is in and really has no idea what he's talking about!  Hello?  What if the corruption transfers to my computer?  GRRRRRRRRR.  I told him no one, and that means him is using my computer for anything at any time or I won't be working and he can figure out what we'll do.  Pain in the Butt!!!    Ah, that feels better.  Sometimes you just have to vent.  Now if I could just get him a laptop so he'll leave R's computer alone (because the truth is, he rarely uses it even for his e-mail.  Mostly he plays a couple of games on it and then tries to do all sorts of weird stuff that he reads out of context from his school books and messes it up).  I feel mean.  I feel like I don't trust him with this - which I don't now.  Can't really say anything to him because then my little depressive rants about how he's wasting his time at school, and blah, blah, blah, it's somehow my fault.  It's just not worth the crap, in my book.  So I'll vent in my blog which he keeps saying he's going to read, but never has, so who cares?  Worst case senario, he sees how I feel and that I'm too tired of the garbage I get to speak up about it.  That wouldn't be so bad, eh?  Off to bed.

      Let's see......Let's start with the saga of the woman who went too red too fast and hated it.  I tell you, it really affected me.  I hated it.  The morning after I got the color done, I woke up, looked in the mirror and said in a whisper, "Lord, what have I done to myself?"  I almost started crying.  So I whined a bit to J who suggested I go get it fixed.  Hey!  That's a novel idea and it came from Mars!  What gives?  lol.  Now, you may recall, my hairdresser was wrapping things up to have surgery Monday morning, but I thought it wouldn't be right not to let her know I was going to have something done to change the hair 'situation'.  I called her and told her I just couldn't help it, but I totally hated it and asked if there was something, some kind of special shampoo or something, I could use to fade it fast, I'd appreciate that.  She first said, "Regular shampoo with baking soda and maybe some dishsoap added to it and shampoo a lot!"  "Okay, about how much of these and do I mix them together?"  Then she said, "Can you come in today at 4 p.m?"  This was Saturday.  Yes.  "Okay, come in and we'll put a bunch of blonde highlights in it.  You'll be my last appointment."  So, I took R to a puppet show at the library that morning around 10 a.m. We had arranged to meet a boy there that was in her class this year.  I'd met dad before, but not mom.  So here I was, looking like a cheap $15.00 you-know-what who'd been in a bar all night..........Okay, maybe not quite that bad, but that's how I felt.  I was sure hating being in public with that hair!  His mother was gracious and pretended not to notice how horrible it was.  lol.  I went to see D that afternoon and she really put a lot of blonde highlight in it.  Then she told me to condition the heck out of it every day since it had been double highlighted.  It's looking much, much better, with just a little red in it, and I'm going back to blond, dang it!  I'm grateful to her for being so understanding, too.  I've gone to her for about 10 years now and this is the first time I was totally disappointed with my hair, so that's a pretty good record, I think.  J had his follow up with the Dr. today and got released to return to work.  He'll go back on Thursday night.  He made it through school this evening and did just fine.  So he's well on his way to healing up.  He also got the okay to get back to his bike riding.  He's very happy about that.  My new boss, D, called me last night.  She said she had to call as she'd just finished going over my transcription work and was so impressed with how well I'd done on my first set of transcriptions.  That made me feel really good!  I told her I was a bit of a perfectionist, so it was really important to me to do a good job and I really appreciated her letting me know.  She gave me Monday off, too, as she was still going over other new people's transcriptions.  But tomorrow I go to the office at 10 a.m. to pick up my corrections (I only missed a few words that weren't in my drug book or that I was too unfamiliar with to locate in the medical dictionary) and get another tape from the Dr.  She mentioned maybe giving me a chiro to do tapes for, also, as that's not a 24 hour turn around.  So I could do the dermatologist and fill in any extra time with the chiro work.  I'm familiar with chiro notes from the insurance work I used to do, so that would be easy - mostly describing auto accidents.    Our friends called today to have us go out to dinner again before M heads back to Iraq on Friday.  J had to go to school, so R and I went.  Went to Jason's Deli again.  It's quiet on Tuesdays, so a good place for us to meet and just sit and talk while the kids goof around together.  I took some Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey with me that I'd printed up.  This is the guy on Saturday Night Live that just does the stupid quotes.  We laughed and laughed while we read them and talked.  Okay, if you don't know who he is or what his quotes are like, here are some examples:  One thing vampire children have to be taught early on is, don't run with a wooden stake.  If I was the head of a country that lost a war, and I had to sign a peace treaty, just as I was signing, I'd glance over the treaty and then suddenly act surprised.  "Wait a minute!  I thought we won!"  When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was call the police.  But then I got curious about it.  I picked it up, and started wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns.    If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down?  We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.  Okay, you get the point.  He's weird but funny.  And we laughed a lot.  Then we did a little shopping with them so we could blab more and then got some ice cream.  Yeah, I know........Anyway, M leaves Friday for Iraq and we won't see him again for a while as they will move to Texas before he gets back home.  It's so sad.  And I'll miss them so much.  But.......  After a slow start, R has improved on her swimming with the swim team.  I think she just needed time to adjust to not having that individualized attention she had with her private lessons.  Today, she repeatedly swam laps on the full length of the pool, all different types of strokes that she's been taught and the instructor told her to do.  I was really proud of her.  After Monday, she'd done so poorly, I'd begun to think we pushed her to it too soon.  She had just not been trying very hard, it seemed.  But today, she even picked up her speed.  She did very, very well.  I've got more to post, but it's getting late and I'm getting punchy.

      I've missed a few days posting because I've been so busy.  Starting my job on Monday, I spent most of that day running around getting things set up.  Tuesday, I got my first tape to transcribe.  As I worked that day - what ended up being a lot longer than I had hoped, 8-10 hours total, but I'm not sure on the time because, of course, there were times I stopped to tend to R's needs and make a salad to eat and such - I started thinking this would never work out.  I felt I would never catch on.  I was totally, completely exhausted and I could scarcely think straight.  It took me all day to just complete the first side of the tape.  The problem is that my perfectionism came out.  My boss had just told me to type it up and not worry about the words I didn't get.  But I just couldn't.  I had to try to look up what each word I didn't know sounded like and then try to figure it out.  I did pretty well.  There were still a couple I didn't get, that I couldn't find, and one my boss told me what it was when I told her what it sounded like.  It was two medical words joined, so I wasn't sure.  When I finished the other side on Wednesday, after J's surgery and getting home, it only took about an hour or so.  That side was also only about 1/2, but it was considerably faster for me since I'd mastered almost all of the words.  So, by Wednesday, my confidence had grown.  Wednesday morning was J's surgery.  He did really well and it was only about an hour and 1/2 before the Dr. came out to tell us it was over and went well.  They kept him overnight because of his sleep apnea.  That was nice because I would have been very worried about him and probably not slept well.  R was a doll the whole time we were waiting!  She really behaved and was a real sweetie, making the nurses and other people in the waiting room smile a lot.  I read an entire American Girls Samantha book to her (it's the doll she wants - but they are about $65.00, so we'll have to see about it for Christmas or her birthday).  We played Barbie's and she had a workbook or activity book that she worked on, too.  Right about the time she was growing bored, the Dr. was done and the 45 minutes of Jay's recovery that we had to wait had passed.  We went back to see him and R was all teary.  She'd been worried and really needed to see him.  We stayed for only about another 45 minutes because I knew I needed to come home to do my work and didn't know how long it would take me.  R layed on J's bed with him and cuddled.  J asked me to bring back a DVD for him as he wanted to watch something since the TV stunk and he didn't like their movies.  I told him it would depend on how much work I got done.  Of course, I felt awful about that, but what could I do?  My working changes our family in a lot of positive ways, but it also changes it in some negative ways and that's what I think he'll have a hard time adjusting to.  Thankfully, since my work didn't take long on Wednesday, we were able to go back and take the movie to J and stay a while with him.  Now, on the other hand, R is doing great with the changes my working brings!  She's had to be more responsible and do things (that most other 7 and 8 year olds probably do) like dress herself, wash her own hair, regularly making her bed - which was patchy before, getting her own things to drink ----I know, I have terribly spoiled her.  But she's been loving being so independent!  It's been wonderful.  She's even told me she'd get her own breakfast some mornings.  She's done really well.  My girl sure is amazing.  And it's odd how I feel closer to her - I guess because of this change in our relationship.  We've been laughing and playing together more.  Probably because I'm not spending as much time doing stuff for her - lol.  Anyway, it's been great for she and I.  Okay, so I took my work in to my boss on Thursday after we picked J up from the hospital.  She was heading out of town and had forgotten about meeting me!  lol.  Her office manager was in, though, and called her.  She told me to leave the work there, she'd check it out and call me Monday to come pick up another tape and do corrections on what I turned in.  She knew J had surgery, too, and knew I needed to look after him and was tired.  She's just the sweetest lady and I'm so grateful to be working for her.  So, I'm off until Monday.  That's good as I had plenty of errands to run, including picking up a water pik for J for cleaning out his nose 3 times a day.  It's really helped him to feel better.  And I've gotten some much needed rest after all the craziness.  Got my hair cut and colored red again today.  Most of the color had gone out as it had been about 10 weeks.  I had gotten back to being pretty blond.  My hairdresser says my natural color is a medium blond with some mild red highlights.  But she thought I should go darker this time on the red.  I did.  I'm a little freaked out about it.  It's a bit more shocking, but it will tame in about a week and then I'll see if I really like it.  And my poor hairdresser!  She called to reschedule me earlier than next week because Monday she has to have surgery for a torn rotator cuff!  I don't know how she kept doing her job, but she kept most appointments.  She can't work for 3 months after, though.  So she's got some ladies at the same salon who will take over for her.  I told her I'd see how things go because, shoot, she's been doing my hair for.....I think 12 years!  I don't really want anyone else to do it.  So we'll see if I can handle letting it go 3 months.  I don't know, though.  We've had continuous rain here since Monday.  Swim team practice was managed for Monday night and Tuesday morning, but not since.  The weather's been so bad and then the heater at the pool broke down!  There is a swim meet tomorrow, but her swim teacher doesn't think R is ready and I have to agree.  So we'll skip this one.  Lots of the kids her age skip them or just go watch them.  Instead, we're heading to the library tomorrow.  They're having a puppet show at 10:00 a.m. and then we'll get her stuff for the Summer Reading Program checked.  She gets a paperback book and some stickers and stuff for the 2 weeks we've read every day.  I'm so proud of her with her reading.  My brother, who is a teacher, says she's reading on a 3rd grade level - only struggling with 4th grade level words.  She read her other Samantha book on her own and only asked me what about 5 words were.  These are good size chapter books!  It's exciting to me that she's loving reading so much...and math.    Can't really think of anything else I might have missed.  Guess I'll go post some stuff at my e-mail group.

      Feeling a bit nervous.  I got up around 6 a.m. this morning, swept and mopped my bathroom floors, swept the downstairs floors, then did a workout - Leslie Sansone's 2 mile brisk walk.  Felt good.  Then I headed upstairs and made beds, picked up some stuff, got R some breakfast and then took a shower.  About 10 minutes before I was to call my new job (to be sure she is in the office and go pick up my equipment), the place J is having his surgery on Wednesday called and said we had to pay the difference that the insurance wouldn't cover on the day of the surgery!  That's in two days!  It's not that it's that much, although certainly more than we can pay on Wednesday, but it's the principle of the thing.  You call someone 2 days before a surgery you've had scheduled for 6 weeks and tell them they need to pay the difference from their insurance?  I think not!  I told her we'd just have to go someplace else for the surgery.  She started back pedaling and said, "Well, maybe you could pay half of it," as if that resolves the whole issue.  I told her no, J didn't even get paid until Thursday and we didn't know where our finances were at the moment.  She offered to take a post-dated check!  I'm like, snap out of it, lady!  She suggested I talk to J and call her back.  I called him and he's really ticked.  He said to forget the surgery altogether.  But, of course, he really does need to have this.  He ended up deciding to call the Dr. and see if we can move the surgery elsewhere.  Otherwise, he'll tell the Dr. office to take care of it and have us billed - like every other hospital in this State does it - in 30 days.  And if that doesn't work - and I totally don't want him to do this - he's going to cancel the surgery and just live with it.  But that's not a very good choice.  He's been repeatedly sick with sinus infections and we think his CPAP machine (the breathing machine for his sleep apnea) isn't working as well because it can't get enough air through his nose to serve it's purpose.  So not having this surgery really isn't the best choice.  I wouldn't be surprised if the surgery place ran a credit check and saw ours was really good, so decided they could push us into paying immediately and saving them the costs of billing us.  This is so frustrating!  Anyway, that got me all worked up and then I had to turn around and call my job.  But she's not in, which I was a bit grateful for as I could come here and post this and vent.  I'm a bit nervous and because J is working overtime, I have to take R with me to the place while I complete the paperwork and pick up the machine.  It's really not a problem because she'll be as good as gold and just read and do a workbook while I'm in the office with my boss.  I let D know that when I left the message for her this morning.  She had said she 'thought' she'd be in by 10 a.m. this morning and wanted me to call just to let her know I'm on my way.  Hopefully, I hear from her soon as I don't want to waste another day waiting for this to get going.  I have so much to do, but need to get started on work first.    R starts her swim team classes tonight.  Mondays will be a 7 p.m. class, Tues. will be at 8 a.m., Wed. will be at 5 p.m. and Thurs. will be at 8 a.m.  I believe they are about 45 minutes long.  I also need to run to the store for some salad and a couple of other items.  At least I got up and did my workout this morning, though.    I'm thinking about starting an additional blog where I write my short stories.  I'm not sure about it being a safe place to do that, so if anyone has any suggestions on that, please post it in comments.  It's not that I don't have any place to post them - I can just type them up on the computer and save them in documents (I also always print them out, so I don't have to worry about losing them).  Anyway, safety issues, meaning not having to be concerned about someone stealing my stories and publishing them as being written by themselves, is my fear on that.  Just got a call from my new boss!  She had something come up this morning, so wants me there at 1 p.m.  J will be home by then and can keep R, although she said that's never a problem with her.  She's such a nice lady.  And J called to say that he called the surgery place and they backed right off and said we could sign a promisary note saying we'd pay the remaining amount in 60 days.  Much better for us and definately something we can manage.    Okay, off to the store for the salad and stuff.

      Picked up R this morning around 11:30 a.m. from her overnighter.  She did great!!  She slept beside one of her favorite leaders (there are 3, but will be just two next year as the troop is splitting).  T said she had to hold her hand a couple of times - when she was first trying to fall asleep and then during the night once or twice - but that R fell right to sleep when she did.  I'm so relieved that it went so well!  She's had a lot to tell me about this morning, too.  They saw so many things.  R fed the giraffes right out of her hand!  She had a wolf behind a glass enclosure that was nose to nose with her and pounced at her several times, like it was trying to get a mouse!  The monkeys woke them early, howling to be fed!  It was a great experience for her.  And she had a great time!  J called around 11:15 a.m. to say he was at the top of the hill on the ride!  This is the quickest he's ever gotten to the top.  He gets to ride down, at least 90% of the way, back now.  He was pretty excited!  His riding buddy, however, only made it about 40 miles and turned back.  Anyway, this means he'll be home earlier than he would have.  That will be nice....and means I need to come up with something for dinner.  lol.  Last night, I'd wanted to post some other stuff and sort of ran out of time.  I seem to have a better chance posting everything if I do it during the day.  So, that's why I'm posting early today.    I watched President Reagan's funeral Thurs. on TV.  Of course, when someone dies, people tend to be more kind to them, but I thought it was amazing how many people showed their respects to him.  Just normal people - not just the usual dignitaries.  And I always thought him a good man and a good president.  As in every case, no one is flawless and he made his mistakes like the rest of us do.  But all in all, he did some amazing things as president.  I think his wife felt good knowing so many people thought well of him, too.  It was a huge kindness to her, as well.  Then, watching all the former presidents and our current president sitting together, I realized all but the Clintons had really good, long lasting marriages, too, like the Reagans.  I thought that a powerful statement in a country where divorce rates are so high.  And so no one reads that statement wrong.....I believe there are marriages that are not salvagable, but I think those are a pretty low percentage.  These are the marriages where some terrible wrong has been done to a spouse, where abuse exists, where there is no love ever or for a long time, where there is no respect or decency toward one or both partners, where one partner is not willing to work at making things better or commits such horrible acts that forgiveness is extremely difficult, if not impossible.  The marriages that bring the percentage up so high, I think, are when people just stop working at being married, being a couple, they live as though they are on their own, not a spouse to someone, they quit when things get a little tough.  I clarify this because I know many people who are no longer married, are on their way out of a bad marriage or are on an additional marriage.  And they are good people who had these circumstances that couldn't be resolved.  I want them to know that I don't pass judgement on them or condemn them for their decisions.  Who the heck would I be to do such a thing as that?  It was just can observation that came from watching the funeral.  We got a security system put in today.  If you know me, you know we have little money.  But this is a new Honeywell system that they are trying to get out, so with a 3 year contract, we got all the equipment free (over $1000.00 worth) and then we'll have a monthly fee of $40. for the system.  With my working now, we can afford that and since J works nights, it will be an added safety for R and I.  We have 3 days to decide if we want to keep it, too.  So, we'll see how it goes.  R's best friend called and invited her to go play on a Slip'N'Slide in her backyard today.  I drove her over this afternoon and she stayed til 5 p.m.  Had I finished this post shortly after I started it, instead of crashing on the bed for an hour today after I took R over to her friend's - lol - I'd have been done with this post already!  I haven't done a gratitude journal in some time, so I'll wrap up with that.  1.  I am grateful for my husband and daughter - for all the things they teach me, for the way they make me a better person, for the love they give me and allow me to return to them, for the family that we are, for the way they took my loneliness away when they came into my life - each filling my heart in a different way.  2.  I am grateful for other members of my church.  The two young men that came to the house today to first, sell us the security system and second, install it, are both members of our church.  The company they work for, which actually markets the new product for Honeywell, is based in Orem, Utah.  I had been uncomfortable at first because J was gone, R was gone and I was talking to the first one and let him in the house when we decided to try the system.  Then he saw our pictures on the wall - of the prophet of our church and his two counselors, of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, of Christ....and he said, "I bet you guys go to this church right over here," pointing to our church, which is right next to our townhouse complex.  I said, "Yes.  How did you know that?" not thinking about the pictures on the wall, which we are used to.  He pointed them out, then told me he was LDS and what ward he attends while here (they only work in an area for about 3-4 months, then return home for a few months before they go to the next job area).  I felt calm and relieved then.  That's not to say that all LDS people are good and trustworthy, but there is definately a connection bewteen us when they are good people.  The same thing happened with the young man that came in to install the system about an hour later.  3.  I am grateful for the cooler days we are having - under 90 these last few days.  4.  I am grateful for our dog and how safe she makes me feel when I'm home alone or J is gone at night, working.  She's a good protecter and well behaved for the most part.  5.  I am grateful for having the things I believe to be important in my life - family, good friends, love, my sight, hearing, other senses, being an American, my faith, my freedom and being happy overall.  If things were to change in an instant today or tomorrow, I would have in my life the things that are most important to me.

      Well, my baby girl is on her first overnighter and it happens to be with her Brownie Troop.  I'm missing her.  It's funny, but as I drove away, I had a physical ache in my gut for her.  I love that child beyond my own understanding, even.  What a great blessing she is in my life.  Before I left her today, I did all the mom things - "remember to listen well, be careful, behave, brush your teeth tonight, take your medicine (her asthma inhaler) and most of all, remember where I'll be."  She said, "I know, Momma.  In my heart."  I almost cried.  We pulled up behind them at a stop sign and she turned around waving and blowing kisses.  J and I did the same back to her.  I know she's having a wonderful time and that her Scout leaders will take good care of her.  In fact, they might be in bed by now.  It's almost 9:30 p.m. here.  She has her little pink unicorn to sleep with, a new slumber bag and a small pillow from the sofa (because the zoo is on the side of a mountain and her backpack was full.  They are using backpacks, then carry their slumber or sleeping bags and a pillow.  I was able to fit the small pillow into her backpack, so it will be easier for her to hike up the mountain side.    J is working on his bike, getting it all ready for the ride tomorrow.  His friend is picking him up at 3:15 a.m. now.  So, I won't see much of him until.....shoot, who am I kidding?  He's going to be so tired, I'm sure we won't really have a chance to "see" each other (talk a bit) until his next day off.  Plus, his surgery is on Wednesday.  Then I'll see so much of him the week or two he's home, I'm sure I'll want to strangle him!  lol.    Today, as I was reading posts in my e-mail group, it occurred to me that all the healthy eating in the world won't get you very far if you don't exercise.  Now I'm not saying you don't have to eat healthy.  I'm not even saying you don't have to eat healthy most of the time.  You do.  But I am saying that it will only take you so far if you don't exercise, too.  These are things I've really known all along - at least since I last lost weight - but apparently needed reminding of this time around.  A dear friend of mine has lost 50 pounds and is now 4 years at goal!  Do you realize how rare it is for someone to keep the weight off this long?  She's remarkable and an inspiration to us all.  And how does she maintain her weight?  How does she eat right all the time?  Well, she manages the first part by exercising daily.  The second one, she does most of the time because you must in order to keep it off.  But, no one is perfect.  She makes up for any slack in healthy eating with the exercise.  That really seems to be the key.  Then we can look at "what is healthy eating?"  I think that depends on each person.  For some, low carbing works best.  For another, it's low fat.  Our body chemistries are all so different, it just depends on what your body needs you to do to make it drop weight.  And we learn that by trial and error.  But one thing is the same for everyone - in order to lose and keep off your weight, you must both eat healthy and exercise.  Now, if only I can put it into action!  Sigh.......

      I don't know the name of the song (tune) that's running through my head, but today's title is to the tune and similar.  Yeah, I know.  Wierd train of thought here.  Just taking a short break from cleaning as my back is KiLlInG Me!  But I really want to get it done tonight.  I went through all the notebooks and huge stack of R's school and church papers dating back to 2001, when she went to preschool for the first time.  She was in 3 year old preschool and then 4 yr old preschool before kindergarten and first grade.  I have ALL of the papers she's done from ALL of those years.....well, not anymore.  I threw a boat load of them out!  Now I've got one 3 inch notebook with both preschool years in it, one with kindergarten and one with 1st grade.  Still have to finish putting the papers in the 1st grade one - I put them in those clear plastic sleeve sheets.  Then need to finish cleaning upstairs.  I also still need to vacuum the livingroom, although all the rest of the flooring is done down here.  Something about a clean house really makes me feel good.  Sort of calms me.  So, I'm cleaning and trashing papers and other junk out of the house.  The hoping is that I get this all done so I can enjoy the rest of this week.  The crabbing was just earlier today when it was so darn hot while I was cleaning.  Then a storm blew in and it's nice and cool now.  Only about 63F.  Oh, yeah!!!!  Got a call from my employer today.  She's going out of town for the rest of the week but will be back in her office on Monday.  She got the power cord in today that we need for the equipment I'll be using.  So, she told me to call her anytime after 10 a.m. on Monday, just to let her know I'm coming, and she'll have me do the paperwork and pick up the transcription machine.  I'm glad I have this extra time to wrap stuff up, too.  R goes on her Brownie's camp out this Friday - home on Saturday, late morning.  I need to still get a mess kit for her somewhere, as well as some shoes.  Her tennis shoes just stink something awful, even after two washings and putting dryer sheets in them whenever they are not on her feet - lol.  Plus, a growing hole where her little toe is on the left shoe.  Otherwise, I think I'm set for her camp out.  J will be going on his day long bike trip on Saturday, the Tour de Cure, which is the diabetes ride, too.    Tomorrow, I pick up our good friends and take them to the airport around 8:30 a.m.  They are heading to Hawaii to see K's family.  Then I'll head off to get J's prescriptions for his upcoming surgery, some Dr. Pepper for him so he'll stop taking mine (I'd never get a drop if I didn't separate our supply of it), some Thousand Island dressing so I can make our Rueben sandwiches tomorrow night for dinner and some bagels.  Two of the stores we do some shopping at are carrying this low cal bagel I found - 150 or 180 calories each.  R loves them and I enjoy them, too.  Then I head off for my hair appointment around 2 p.m.  It's a color, so I'll be there a while.  Have to take something with me to entertain R.  Plus, I plan to get her hair trimmed while we're there.  It helps a lot with the tangles.  Her hair is so thick and long, it really tangles without plenty of conditioner and some detangler spray every time I brush it out.    Well, it's late and my kid is still awake, but clearly tiring.  I'm off to put her to bed, then finish cleaning.  Ugh!  Hope I can clean in her room without disturbing her - lol.  Otherwise, I'm stuck finishing it tomorrow.  And, unfortunatly, that's probably what will happen.  Darn it!  Oh well.

      We went to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban tonight.  What a great movie!  We loved it!  R got a little scared a couple of times with the dementors, but otherwise, she was very excited about the whole thing.  I'm looking forward now to the extended version DVD to come out - as I'm sure there will be one.    We had a long day and R is exhausted.  School was only until 11:30, but it was an active day.  Then a special lunch for the kids - hot dogs, chips, juice and cookies before school let out.  After that, the Marble Slab ice cream shop ran a deal that any kids from our school coming in today and stating they are with the school would earn our school 15% of the purchase!  Terrible sentence, but I'm avoiding naming the school - lol.  Anyway, too great a deal to pass up.  So, a whole bunch of us went up there.  We had a great time, laughing and talking while the kids ate their ice cream and played.  When we got home, it was after 1:00.  J got home about 1/2 hour later and we all sort of crashed, just rested, until we headed to the movie.  Now J is getting R into bed after her bath and I'm quick to follow.    Didn't hear from my employer yet today, so I'm assuming the power cord has not come in.  She's expecting it in the mail.  Hope it gets here tomorrow or Thurs. as I'd like to start working.  Then I can get my schedule organized so I'm able to get everything done I need to.  My house leaves much to be desired, although I got the kitchen all cleaned up today after we got home from school.    Well, I've got the bills to get paid and then I'm off for a shower and to bed.  I'm sure there is more I could say, but I'm worn out.

      Eeeeeeeeeeee!  It was a dang heat record today!  It hit 98 F today.  But we gave in and turned on the A/C.  This is how that happened: Phone rings around 7:30 a.m.   "Hello."  Not a sing song voice. "Hi, Honey.  How are you this morning?"  Jay asks. "Hot.  At 7:30 a.m., I am hot."  I can tell he's thinking, "Great crabby woman at home."  LOL. "Okay, well we need to just give in and turn on the A/C today."  "What about it being cleaned out first?  What about it being on it's last legs?" I say with little inflection in my voice because I already have a heat headache. "I'll get it when I get home.  It's okay.  Just turn it on, Honey." "Okay!" I say, brightening, knowing I can now live through this crappy, hot day.    That's not exactly what was said, but pretty close.  Our house is comfortable and tomorrow is supposed to be considerably cooler.  In fact, the whole week is with a little rain coming our way.  Thank goodness.  I'm just really not good about the heat.  Honestly, I feel rather sick in it, when it's in the 90's.  Jay expressed the need to find a way to replace the money he took, so he is working all the overtime he can this week, while his school is out.  I think making amends that way is a good way to correct what's been done.  And I think it's helping him to feel better as he's quite the one to beat himself up over stuff to the excess and detriment of himself and everyone around him.  Hopefully, this will be the beginning of taking care of this problem for him.  I really see it as something akin to a problem gambler or alcoholic.  He gets depressed and he's not the person he is when his medication is working well and he's feeling good.  The sad part is, we will spend a lifetime seeking new medications as the current ones stop working when his body builds up immunity to them.  But it's hard to know when it's needing new meds (and he totally hates having to go through med changes - who can blame him) or it's just from coping with the moment.  Until it's bad, we keep thinking it's just the stresses of the moment.  So, it's not a fun struggle.  But I love him and I feel very strongly that I was meant to be in his life.  To, perhaps, even save his life.  I want to be his wife for all eternity - just without the hassles - lol.  So, I'll pray and try to be a positive support and keep looking for the light at the end of the tunnel.  One day, he will overcome this challenge - I feel sure of that.  Deep down, I know he is a good man.  Often times, I see that in him.  Even most of the time.    As for the job, I called D around 11 this morning because I hadn't heard from her.  She was at the vet with her dog whose paw had been injured.  She hadn't gotten the power cord we need for the transcription machine I'll be using but expects it in tomorrow's mail.  I told her I'd be at R's school in the morning but gave her my cell number so she can reach me when it comes in.  When I interviewed with her, the mail came around 11:30, which is when R gets out of school tomorrow.  So, hopefully, that will be the case so I can spend this last day at school with R and the other kids in the class that I've worked with all year. I'm going to miss the ones we won't be hanging around all summer.  Went out today and got some little gifts for R's teachers.  She has her main teacher, Mrs. M-P, then her language arts teacher, Mrs. M, then art with Ms. R and music with Mrs. D and finally P.E. or gym with Ms. K.  Since Mrs. M-P is her main teacher, we got her two things - a pointer stick with an apple on the handle end and a magnet about teachers that's really cool. Mrs. M is retiring this year and we got her a beautiful little windchime.  Two other teachers, Mrs. D and Ms. R, got small windchimes, too.  Ms. K got a teacher keychain.  Got them all at a country crafts store with a bunch of booths by the different crafters.  I love the place, but haven't bought much there in years.  I'd seen all this teacher stuff there before, though, so that's were I went.  Then R and I printed up some bookmarks that I laminated with their names, from R and the date and a quote from R about them on the backs.  R was really happy with everything.  We'll go to school a bit early tomorrow and pass them out to each teacher.  Tomorrow is the last day of school.  Can you say "procrastination"?  lol.  Well, for about 4 days now, I've not been eating very healthy.  I mean, part of my day is fine.  The first part.  Mornings and lunch go fine, on track, healthy.  Then evening comes and I'm tired and don't want to have to mess with making anything special.  So, I just grab something.  Usually, it's not something that healthy.  Being tired is my worse enemy.  But I really haven't had time to grab a nap in a long time.  So, I'm just going to have to work around it somehow.  Maybe when I start to wear down, I'll shoot up with some caffiene - lol.  I think that the real help will be when I start working out again.  And I plan to do that soon.  Just want school over tomorrow and to see how the job is going to affect my time, how to schedule everything.  The exercise is bound to give me more energy and help me keep going.  Gratitude Journal:  1.  I am grateful that no matter what happens, I can turn to prayer and be comforted.  I know that's not the case for everyone, but I wish it were.  I find such peace in knowing I can cope with things in the best way possible by praying about it first.  And by doing so, I don't react in anger or without thinking.    2.  I am grateful for my mom whom I call about once a week (sometimes more when there is a lot going on) and that she listens to me if I need to let things out.  Mind you, she always starts out defending anyone I might be upset with (Not that this happens often, it's just on my mind because I called her about all the stuff with my brother when I thought he wasn't being very kind or thoughtful), but once I mention to her that whoever she's defending can't be up for sainthood - lol - or that these things are not what I need to hear, she backs off and allows me to have my say and talks to me about it fairly.    3.  I am grateful for discovering that I can keep a conversation with my dad going over the phone if we talk about books.  He's a big time reader, loves books, reads them constantly and knows that I read a lot, too.  So not too long ago, we discovered this about each other and prior to that, I hadn't talked much to him on the phone, except to say, "how are you?  I love you.  take care.  is Mom there?' etc. for a long time.  4.  I am grateful for air conditioning!!!!  I really, really am!!!!  LOL.  5.  I am grateful for this job, even though it is a bit frustrating that it hasn't started yet.  Maybe the Lord, in his infinate wisdom, has given me a chance to finish up some stuff.  Off to bed for me - after I drink a bunch of water because it's still hot!  GRRRRRRRRR.  Did I mention I'm not a summer person?

      I've got three things on my mind to post in this blog tonight, after posting earlier this evening and trying to decide if I'd do more.  The first was an experience I had when I was about 17 years old.  It came to mind because of an e-mail story a friend sent to me.  This is it:  When I was 17 years old, my parents threw me out and moved to the city (I was raised in a small town east of the Denver area).  I called my oldest sister, not knowing what to do and she told me to come up to Greeley, a college town she lives in to this day.  I moved in with her and her family for a couple of months while I found a job and an apartment.  Not long after I got my own apartment, my car broke down, the transmission going out, and I couldn't afford to fix it.  So I started walking 2 miles to work every day and 2 miles home.  I was working at a grocery store at the time, in the bakery, making the morning donuts.  On the week days that I worked, I had to be there at 3 a.m., but on the weekends, because there were so many more donuts to make, I had to be there at 1 a.m.  The way I had to walk caused me to cross a main street in Greeley (10Th Ave.).  And I used to walk along the residential streets paying attenion to who had lights on in their houses at that time of the morning.  I also used to be very quiet and listen hard to any noises as an added safely precaution.  One morning, it was very cold and windy out and I didn't have a winter coat, so I had on two jackets and put my work apron over my head and ears, trying to stay warm.  Of course, under those circumstances, I couldn't hear anything and I was really scared because of it.  I started praying for help and protection and finally just asked that someone be sent to hold my hand until I got to work.  I put my hand down and out, like you would to hold someone's hand and I actually felt someone - something - take my hand!  Too afraid to look - lol - I walked on, a feeling of calm over me.  That feeling of calm and the feeling of the hand holding mine did not go away until I was outside the store, knocking on the doors to be let in.  It was an amazing experience.  And it was my first real experience of the power of prayer.  The other thing on my mind is.......okay, by the time I got this far, I only had one other thing on my mind - lol.  Age, I'm sure.  lol.  J's been in a depression for some time.  I've been aware that he was struggling a lot, but I thought it was because of school and all the problems he had this last term.  However, it's still there.  The difference is that he doesn't fall into a dark place he can't bring himself out of.  He's been functioning well, been working on our relationship, been being a good father to R, etc.  What happens is that when he does something he's ashamed of, he lashes out at me and sometimes at R.  This is very upsetting.  Makes me angry, too.  Because it's not fair or right or decent of him.  He needs to just take responsibility for his behavior and then correct it.    Okay, here's what happened:  He is going to be riding in the Tour de Cure - a bicycle ride of 25, 50 or 75 miles for diabetes.  In order to ride, he has to raise funds, donations.  He's been doing that.  He told me a few weeks ago that he used $5.00 from that fund for something (I honestly can't recall what it was, but it must have either seemed reasonable or I was too exhausted to be upset about it and, thus, somehow be blamed for his behavior, etc).  I asked him if he wanted me to hold on to the envelope for him.  No, he'd stay out of it.  So, okay.  He promised.  He gave his word.  But last night he told me that during this depression he's been in, he managed to use $55.00 of it.  Not only that, he stole quarters I'm saving for R out of a can he 'accidently' found out about.  All this money is blown on food and Dr. Pepper (all of which we have at home).  The sad part is, I discovered he could not control money very early on in our marriage.  It's something I really hate because it means I'm stuck with making sure all the bills are handled, the check book balances, etc.  Over the past almost 10 years, we have had to slowly limit his access to our funds more and more.  One time in a fit, he ran off and cleaned out our checking account, then lost some money he'd put down for a hotel room - only to come home that same night.  Another time, he was taking $20 "for gas" about 3 times a week with his ATM card.  It's been these sort of things - and almost always when our money is tight, which I always inform him of and ask him to keep a lid on his spending until things are better.  Anyway, now we are at the point that he has no debit card, no ATM card, no checks, no credit cards.  My name is the only name on our savings account (not that there is all that much in there).  He can't be trusted not to blow all our money on himself, almost exclusively for food and Dr. Pepper.  We aren't talking about large amounts in a week's time, but it sure adds up.  He knows R has been needing shoes and that when the Harry Potter movie came out, she wanted to see it.  We promised she could.  But now we have to 'replace' $55.00 of stolen money for the bike ride.  And I'm out at least $4 - $5 in quarters that he's been stealing out of my little banks, although I suspect it's more than that.  I had to hide all of the little banks in the house last night.  He's stolen from my purse before, too, so I have had to hide that, too.  And that's what really upsets me so much.  It's not like we haven't been down this road before.  He had gone and talked to the Bishop at our church about what he'd done when he was taking money out of my purse back then.  I was saying I couldn't believe I wasn't able to keep track of some cash I'd had in my purse and he never said a word.  It was days later when his guilt got to him.  Same thing this time, his guilt made him confess.  And I told him it's not even so much the issue of the money, although in my book it is stealing and it is appauling that he would do such a thing.  The big thing is that he has shattered a level of trust in our marriage.  If I can't trust him to keep his promise, his word, and not steal again, how can I trust him not to be unfaithful or to act in a manner that hurts our family or our church, both of which he represents?  Tonight I explained to him that he knows he can trust me.  He knows that I will work hard to be a good wife and mother.  He knows that I will take care of our home.  He knows I will get the bills paid on time.  He knows that I will fulfill my obligations to others, as well as my calling at church.  He said, "Well, I don't care if you don't do your calling at church."  And that made me mad.  He's always playing the religion card on me.  So I said, "You know who I am and what sort of person I am.  When I am obligated, as in my calling to teach my kids at Sunday school, I will do it if at all possible.  If I were suddenly to stop being that sort of person, that would be a betrayal of your trust in me.  I would suddenly not be the person you thought I was."  He said he understood what I was saying about that.  But I don't know if he did or not.  Men are so dang selfish - never seeing what damage they cause others trying to "take care of themselves" above all others.  It's really frustrating and embarrassing.  That's why I wasn't sure I should post what happened.  I'm ashamed that he could be that sort of a person.  I'm ashamed that I'm married to someone who doesn't hold the same basic values as I do - but certainly presents himself as having them.  At first, he lashed out at me about all this.  Like it was my fault.  But I stopped him and told him I was not to blame for his behaviors and would not let him yell and be mean to R and I over this stuff.  I guess that's all I can do - give him some food for thought and hope he discusses this with his therapist.  He knows, fully admitted tonight, that he has a problem with this.  And it is actually a common issue in marriages with a partner who suffers from depression.  So I told him it would make sense to talk it out with his therapist.  That's what we pay her for.  I hope he does.  He sees her on Tues.    What's hard is that I love this man so damn much.  I really do.  There was a time I didn't, or at least didn't think I did.  Not like I do now, anyway.  But as he's gotten better with his depression, learned to treat me better, with more respect and love, and we've been through all the marriage counseling and individual counseling, I've come to feel a really deep love for him.  To think he is not who I thought he was is deeply painful to me.  And it makes me sad to think I might never be able to trust him with our money.  That forces me into a parent position on that issue and him into a child position.  Anyone whose been through counseling knows that's not how you want things to be in a marriage.  I guess I can continue to encourage him to do what he needs to for help and pray.  I don't know what else to do.

      Today we went to the park to meet with my brother, his family and his wife's family and my other brother met us there, too.  The single brother brought R a rose from his rose bushes he planted this year!  She was thrilled, both because it was from him and because it is her favorite flower.  He even remember pink was her favorite color and that's what color that rose was.  The two of them are so very close and she ran to him and hugged and hugged him.  She loves being with him.  She had 2 little 'books' she had written about seeing him this weekend that she gave him, too.  They were really cute.  As we were walking to the place at the park (a very large one), my other brother spotted us and came walking toward us.  He came up to hug R and I felt so bad because she ran behind my other brother from him.  I'd tried to tell her we were going to see him and I show her pictures of them all the time, but she was scared anyway.  However, it didn't take her long and she warmed right up to him.    It was terribly, terribly hot the whole time we were there.  It's hot still and I'm letting R stay up because it's just too hot to sleep right now.  I had a chance to see my nieces for a bit and R played with 4 kids, 2 older and 2 her age, that are kids of a cousin of my SIL.  They played in a small stream there.  I didn't know there was one, so hadn't brought her swim suit, but I told her to just enjoy herself.  She was soaked!  lol.  But she had a good time.  The baby was really cute, but cranky as he's teething and was being passed around to everyone.  That's so hard on little ones.  Almost everyone was already there when we arrived except one of my nieces and my SIL's sister and her daughter and son - grown - and grandson.  Her mom was there, whom I do know, and her Aunt and 2 cousins and the 4 kids of the one cousin, then my SIL's brother and his wife (who I think came a little after we did), her sister and her husband, kids and grandson.  A friend of my nieces was there, too.  A few other people.  Anyway, it was pretty uncomfortable at first, but after my SIL's sister got there and we talked and laughed some, it got easier.  I took some pictures of everyone together, but R was too wet to hold the baby, so no pics of that.  We got there about 1 and left about 4:30p.m.  It was exhausting, but I'm glad we got to see them all and I had a chance to talk to my brother quite a bit and my nieces some, but just a few words to my SIL.  A little bummed we didn't get to spend more time with the baby, either.      So, there ends the stressful tale of this visit that wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but which I wish we'd had more of a chance to hold the baby and talk to my family.  I really don't know what they are doing in their lives and I guess it doesn't really matter in the long run.  But it would be nice to have been able to find that out and what their plans were.  Oh well.  The last two days have been pretty stressful with J, too.  He seems to be struggling through a depression issue right now - for a few weeks.  Part of me wants to write what happened and part of me feels like I shouldn't.  But I know if I get it out, I'll feel better.  I think I'll think on it a bit and then maybe come back to blog it after R is in bed.

      It was darn hot today!  Got up to 95F!  Dang Summer!  Thankfully, this state is famous for cooling off in the evenings and at 8:30p.m., it's down to 73F.  Of course, it will take the house a bit longer to cool that much.    We slept in this morning until 8:30 a.m.  J had to work overtime and was gone by 5 a.m.  After we woke up (R was in my bed), we played with the dog a bit, then got up for breakfast and to get ready to go to the Library Summer Reading Program Kick-off.  Got there 5 minutes after it started and it was pretty packed.  We had to park on the street and walk in.  But R had fun jumping on the Castle moonwalk thingy, doing a 'balloon between the knees' race, checking out a fire truck and EMT ambulance and making a couple of crafts.  But the big thing today was......She got her OWN library card!!!  When she was 2 years old, I asked at a different library we used to go to and they didn't issue cards to kids until they were 8 or 12 (I can't recall which).  But one of the crafts today was making a beaded necklace that you clipped your library card to.  So I asked and sure enough, she got one!  She was really excited about that.  So we checked out about 16 books and then left, because we'd been out in the heat and we were both thirsty and tired.  Oh, and when the fire truck first got there, she was afraid to go over to it.  At first I couldn't figure out why, but then I remembered about 2 or 3 years ago she went to a pizza place with J to pick up some dinner and while he was paying, she was walking around looking at stuff.  She saw a red square on the wall and pulled it.  Of course, it was the fire alarm.  J scolded her and the people at the store said the fire engine had to come, even if they called to say what happened as it was the law.  J made her stay and wait for the firemen.  So she thought it would be some horrible thing and was crying.  Anyway, the firemen came in and one came over and spoke softly to her, telling her it was okay and just not to do that again unless there was a real fire.  Of course, I'm sure touching one of those will be the last thing she ever thinks of again - lol.  Then, a few months later, we came walking out of a grocery store when the firemen were out with there boots for Labor Day (for anyone outside the U.S., to raise funds for the Jerry Lewis Telethon for Muscular Dystrophy, the firemen collect money from people in their fire boots by standing on street corners and going out to cars when the lights turn red, standing outside grocery stores and other stores, standing outside the fire houses, etc.).  Anyway, as we came out, this fireman came toward us saying, "I know you!  I remember you from the pizza place when you pulled the alarm!"  He was being very nice, but R freaked out - lol.  I'm sure because it made her remember that scary situation.  But when she saw the firemen were giving out little plastic fire hats and badges ("Badges?  We don't need no stinkin' badges!") she decided to go over and they were very nice, of course.  Okay, I can't say, read or think of the word badges without that line - "Badges?  We don't need no stinkin' badges!" coming to my mind.  It's from the movie, Blazing Saddles.  Jay disputed it with me, so one day I looked up the sentence on the internet and found this site:  www.darryl.com/badges/moviesindex.shtml  Now, the funny thing about this is, similar lines have been used in a bunch of movies.  In Blazing Saddles, it's said by a Mexican man joining a posse, so when I say it, I use my best Mexican accent.  But J always would ask me if I knew what movie it was from.  I'd tell him yeah, Blazing Saddles and he'd say, "No.  The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."  Well, the line I do was Blazing Saddles, but I had to prove it to Mr. You Know Nothing Unless You Can Prove It Because As Your Husband I Must Know More Than You.  LOL.  Anyway, all the lines, just about, are with Mexican accents and most are said by Mexican characters in the movies.  It's funny.  Watch the clips, if you can, on that site.  Here I sit, hot and tired, with this extraordinarily messy house and my brother coming from Colorado Springs tomorrow.  I keep telling myself I need to clean some.  Just can't seem to get myself to do it.  But, I can't let him see this pit.  So, I'll do a little tonight and then get up early tomorrow and do some more until the downstairs isn't too horrible.  Once I'm working (on Monday!!!), I'll get a schedule going and be able to keep things up better.  Oh, the temp here on my computer just dropped to 69F.  Thankfully!  I can feel it beginning to cool off in the house, too.  We have the fans going, pulling in the cooler air, too.  R needs me to read to her tonight.  Got to go.

      Well, as the clock ticks on, I'm more and more worried about this situation with the job.  I don't know what to think since she hasn't called me back.  I left two messages yesterday and then one this morning to let her know what times I would be available today.  But I also suggested Monday might be better, although I'd fit her in whenever it was convenient for her.  Truth is, I'm swamped today.  But I guess all I can do is wait.  And pray.  BTW, thank you to all my friends who have been praying for me over this.  Today R goes to a birthday party right after school.  T's mom doesn't drive and her hubby couldn't get off work until 4 p.m., so I'm picking her up, taking her to get the balloons and then over to the place where the party is - Chuck E. Cheese.  Then I'll come back to the school and get T, R and two other kids whose mom can't make it.  We'll all go to the birthday party, then head home.  Tomorrow is the kick-off for the Library Summer Reading Program that R and I have done for the last 4 years.  She loves it as you get stickers on a pamphlet for every several books the kids read and it's a theme with prizes for completing the program, usually books, which we've always gotten some really good ones.  Don't know what the theme is this year yet.  They have a bunch of activities for the kids -a moon jump, a bike safety and check station thing, balloon animal makers, face painting, etc.  She'll have a blast.  I just hope it's not as hot as it was last year!  It was in the 90's and it was miserable.  T and several other of her friends are going to be there, too, so she'll have a lot of people to hang around with while she explores.  J has to work overtime, though, so he'll go on a bike ride with her after he gets off work as she's been begging him to spend so extra time with her.  I want to try to sqeeze in getting some shoes for her, too.  She doesn't have any sandels and I saw a cute pair on sale at K-Mart in the Sunday paper, so I want to run over there.  It's not that close to our house, so it will take a bit, but I can't find flats that will fit her foot well any place around here that I've looked.  Then I need to do some cleaning as my house is a pit!    Finally found someone to take my Sunday School class this week.  I don't know how many people I called before I found someone, but thankfully, I did.  So I called my brother - who just got in town late last night (blush) - and let him know.  He said to bring anything we want to the pot luck as everyone is just bringing stuff.  So, I'll do something quick and easy.  My other brother is coming here, then riding with us.  R can hardly wait to see him.  She's made two books for him - pages she staples together as books, then writes in them and draws pictures.  They are both like:  I love my Uncle K.  I can't wait to see him on Sunday.  He is the greatest Uncle ever.  She just adores him!  He'll love getting those!  It's taken me all day to type this up, I've had so much going on.  So, I'm writing again about the job.  While I was gone, D called back and left a message saying she'd spent all that time locating a power cord for her digital transcribing machine and wants to see me on Monday to work everything out!!!!  I'm so relieved and excited!  Finally, a job!  And I really feel like this is perfect for me, too.  Yippee!!!!  Went up to R's school for lunch with her today, but we got there late and the kids were in the lunchroom already.  So we sat with her and R shared her second slice of pizza with J, as well as the orange juice she always takes but never drinks - lol.  They make them take a fruit (the juice) and a veggie.  She eats the cucumbers, no problem, and a number of other veggies, but when it come to fruit, she's picky.  Apples, oranges, bananas, cherries and grapes about cover it.  Then we hung out a little bit while she was at recess and then left.  I picked up T's mom, G, and took her to get the ballooons and take the stuff over to Chuck E. Cheese.  J helped us carrying everything.  It was windy as all get out right when she was bringing the cake out, too!  Been having a lot of tornado warnings.  But, we got everything there successfully.  Then, when we got the balloons, J went in for them.  As he was coming out, a grandma, mother and two little kids, maybe 3 & 4, were walking in.  Anyway, Jay walked out in the wind and acted like the 11 balloons were making him blow away.  He actually did it really well.  G and I laughed so hard we cried.  Then I saw these little kids with their mouths dropped open and freaking out.  They thought he was really being blown away!  ROFL!  It was just too perfect!  The birthday party was fun, the grown-ups able to chat without worrying about the kids too much and the kids playing all the games and rides.  The party went from about 3:50 when we got there until 7:00 or so.  Exhausting and, of course, my girl had a little breakdown.  She was upset that she only had so many tickets (although I tried to get her more, without her knowing) and so she was crying and ultimately tore up her receipt.  I got a replacement, but told her no prize.  We'll see how she behaves next time we are there and then she can use them.  But enough is enough on this behavior crap with her.  I grounded her from computer and TV tomorrow for it and told her if this continues, she'll start not being able to go to parties and other activities.  I warned her about behaving tomorrow, too, at the library thing.  I was embarrassed because people were looking at us when she was pitching her fit at Chuck E. Cheese and told her that better not every happen again.  Walked in the door and turned her over to Jay, who'd stayed home after helping us get everything to the place.  Otherwise, I might have lost my cool with her.  Very frustrating, although I adore her anyway.  But, she has to learn to control those outbursts better.  We're working on it.  I'm talking to her and trying to teach her better ways to cope.  Okay, on to my gratitude journal:  1.  I am grateful for getting this job, which will allow me to help with our family finances, will give me some self confidence, will give me more drive in my life and will really be a stress reliever in many ways.  2.  I am grateful for the prayers of my friends, for the job and other things in my life.  So often, our friends are like our family and are there for us in every area of our lives.  3.  I am gratful for my husband.  He makes me laugh, he makes me smile, he makes me feel loved when I need him most to (it has not always been this way, but we have both learned through lots of marriage counseling and individual counseling how to nurture our marriage, each other, our family - and his depression meds - lol).  I am grateful for the times he makes me feel sexy and when he looks deep into my eyes, so I know how much he feels, even when he doesn't express it well.  And the times I roll my eyes at him, like when I finished my schooling and he said, "Let's go out to dinner to celebrate!" and (this is hard to explain but I'll try to get it across) then made some comment about what else he wanted to do, and he said it in a manner I'm sure a man would like it to be said to him - lol.  Then, you could see it in his face - it dawned on him, like, "oh, that's what I'd like to do to celebrate, but maybe that's not what she'd like to do," and that he was saying it that way - LOL.  Dang men - lol.  Anyway, I am grateful that he can see those things now.  4.  I am grateful for parents who look at you with understanding and.....pity - lol.....when your child acts up in public.  It's such a relief to know you are not alone.  5.  I am grateful for days when you can sleep in, get up and just spend the whole day relaxing - probably especially because they are such rare things.

      Ahhhhhh, I'm tired.  I got up a little excited and scared this morning, knowing I had this interview at 11 a.m. this morning.  The moment I walked in, I liked D, the business owner and person interviewing me.  She put me right at ease.  We both took to each other.  She pretty much talked to me like I was hired and said she'd like to see if my digital work station (DWS) was compatible with her digital voice system.  So, she asked me to head home and give her a call so we could connect it.  I did - got the number and code - and tried it.  The key pad and the instructions that came with this DWS don't match what her digital voice system does.  So, none of my keys did what they said they did.  I was finally able to get in to the recording of the dictated letter and typed it up in a single minute or a minute and 20, I think.  But then I couldn't get it to let me move on to the next letter as there were two I was supposed to do for her.  She had told me to call her back in about an hour, which I did, but had to leave a message.  I tried her an hour later since I'd be leaving to go pick R up from school and had to leave another message.  Then, she'd mentioned they use micro cassettes for their dictations but the two I got from my friend when she moved and quit doing this for a living don't work right.  One has no power cord and the other, well, the tape jumps from so fast it's a mouse speaking to so slow it drags.  I'll have to go buy one.  Anyway, she mentioned having me do these digital letters or a part time dermatologist, which would be the micro cassettes.    Anyway, I think I have a job here.  Hopefully, since she mentioned my coming back to see her tomorrow afternoon, we'll get that all worked out with an application, HIPA forms and such.  I've got much more to say and I wanted to do the gratitude journal, but I'm pooped.  I'll have to try tomorrow.

      I believe I mentioned our friend was home from Iraq for about 3 weeks.  We went to dinner with them last night.  Went to a Jason's Deli because it's not real busy on Tues. nights and had healthy choices.  Anyway, we listened to some stories about his stay these past 7 months in Iraq.  M has been there as a civilian, working in very protected areas, so we haven't been terribly worried about him being there, but still, you can't help but worry some.  He told us about some of the Iraqi's he'd met.  One that stuck out for me was a cleaning woman who was forced to marry while he was there and hated her husband.  Some of the Iraqi's he met, he liked and some of them he wouldn't trust at all.  Hmmmm, just like people here.  Of course they are the same in many ways.  People are people.  He said they don't know what to do with this new found freedom, though.  Some people were driving on the wrong side of the road and when asked what they were doing, they said, "We are free now, so we can drive where we want."  They have been so repressed for so long, they don't know what to do with freedom, something we Amercians and people in many other countries take for granted.    While he was there, he got a bad hair cut from a barber who was used to cutting the military men's hair.  So, he went to an Iraqi barber who shaved his head for him and cut his beard into a goatee.  When he walked out, an Iraqi man approached him right away and was speaking very adamently to him.  M didn't understand, so he got the barber to come out who speaks English well.  The barber told him the man was saying, "You wrestler.  Yes, you wrestler," over and over again.  M told them no, not since high school, but the man was still convinced.  Ended up  he thought M was a "real" professional wrestler named Goldberg!  lol.  Then, on the way home, the same thing happened with a kid here in the U.S., but they never asked him if he was this wrestler guy.  The kid was just smiling at him and staring and kind of wandered over to where M was sitting and watching a DVD on a computer.  He asked the kid if he wanted to watch a movie with him while they were waiting and the kid said, sure!  He sat and watched some old Jackie Chan movie with him and finally the boy asked him if he was heading someplace (I think it was Tallahassee) where there was a pro wrestling match going on.  He told him no, he was headed to Denver.  Anyway, as they parted, the kid was beaming and the dad walked over to M and thanked him.  They thought he was the wrestler, too!  That kid will get to go back and tell all his friends he met this Goldberg guy!  LOL.  He does look like a wrestler, too.  Kind of like a bad boy, too, which his wife said she is liking.  lol.  Well, we had a great visit - talked, laughed and talked some more until we were all tired and the kids really had to get home to bed since it's a school night.  We're going to get together with them once more before M leaves and the family moves to Texas.  Today was R's Field Day.  Both J and I went and took pictures.  Oh, that reminds me - at Jason's Deli, this little girl, maybe in 2nd or 3rd grade, comes walking up to me smiling and sort of waving.  I'm sure she's from the school, but I had no idea who she is.  I know she isn't a first grader, though.  I said, "Hi!  How are you?" like I knew her, but......Guess I'm there enough the kids are all starting to recognize me.  I like that, I must admit, though.  lol. Okay, back to Field Day.  Anyway, it's mostly outdoors and there are a lot of activities for the kids to do.  Fun stuff - like sack races, silver tube relay runs, jump rope races, soft ball throws, rope climbing, etc.  The rope climbing scares R - lol.  Too high for her, I guess.  It was from 9:00 to 11:30 this morning.  Then J and I went right to Wal-mart to finish the rest of our grocery shopping (I don't get any produce there - yuck - or a couple other things).  Came home, put them away and it was almost time to pick up R.  What a day!  This afternoon, I got a phone call for an interview.  The place is only 5-10 minutes from here, she knows I'm fresh out of school, want only about 3 hours a day and want to work from home.  And she's still interested!!!!  lol.  I'm excited and a bit scared.  But I'm going to try to go in with the idea that if I don't get it, it wasn't meant to be.  And I'll keep looking, then.  I just have to go in there calm and ready, that's all.  I'm praying about it and I've asked my friends to pray, too.  If it's meant to be, it will be.    Getting late and I'm worn out from everything today.  Off to bed for me.

      1.  I am grateful for coming to the truth and understanding of what was going on with this Sunday picnic stuff.  And that I didn't pour out my feelings to my brother, even though only some of them are related to this incident and some are long term things.  It could have, likely would have, caused some permanent damage.  Sometimes, it's best to be the peacekeeper and just put away and overcome your own feelings.   2.  I am grateful for music which can raise up your mood, gives you a chance to raise up your voice, can sometimes speak to your heart and can help you speak from your heart.  3.  I am grateful for being able to work at R's school, meeting so many people there - parents and personnel - and being around the kids.  I love the hugs the kids give me, how they all want me to sit with them or read with them.  Kids are a great gift to this world and I'm blessed to be able to show some of them that someone outside their family circle cares about them, too.    4.  I am grateful to live in a country where I can express my feelings, opinions, religion and dreams without persecution and for the sacrifices made by the members of the military throughout this country's history, as well as the sacrifices made by their families.  My father served in Korea and Vietnam, where he was shot in the leg and, thankfully, survived.  My mother honored him by purchasing a Purple Heart licence plate several years ago.  Once he came out to his car after shopping with Mom and there was a note on the windshield.  They thought, at first, someone probably hit their new truck.  But instead, it was a note from someone who had noticed his licence plate and it said, "Thank you for serving our country and the sacrifices you made that give us our freedom today."  He saved that note.  It means a lot to him.  5.  I am grateful for being able to wake up every day with all that is important in my heart right here, under this same roof - my husband, my daughter, the family that we have made, our faith, a roof over our heads, enough to stay afloat and still live in this amazing school district (one of the nations top 3) and have all the friends that we do - both here and on-line, not to mention that we survived J's illness all these years, something that could have easily torn us apart.  We really have been blessed in our lives.

      We finally had an opportunity to have some fun and get out as a family together.  We went out for a late breakfast and then to see Spiderman 2.  It was a really good movie and I loved the ending!  R and J both really enjoyed it, too.   Talked to my boss yesterday, too, and got some positive feedback from her.  That was helpful.  Then we just talked to get to know each other a bit better.  It was good for me to have that reassurance.  Today, I've spent quite a bit of time with R (yesterday after the movie, too), playing, reading, cuddling.  I have to say, I still enjoy playing with Barbie - LOL.  I can't help it!  I just do!  But R has been having some rough days.  I think she's not getting enough sleep.  I've been getting her to bed at the time she will be going to bed when school starts in three weeks but not getting her up in the morning.  So, this morning, I got her up, too.  The problem has been that she is not sleeping soundly and not falling asleep after I leave her room when we are done reading.  I have to talk to her tonight to see what's up - nightmares?  Sounds waking her?  We'll see what she says and go from there.  Anyway, a rough day for my girl means she cries easily and everything is a major crisis.  Ahhhh, my poor, dramatic princess.  She makes life so hard on herself.....  J is in a mood today, too.  He's not put in the effort he needs to on his school work, so he's way behind again this quarter.  It's not that he's not smart enough, nor that he doesn't have the time.  He is and does.  The problem is he doesn't self motivate to get his homework done.  He just lets it slip further and further.  It's frustrating for me because he complains about it constantly, gets in moods that affect us (cranky and pouty) but does nothing to improve it.  I spoke to him about it today and just let things fall where they may.  I just ended it with giving him an ego boost about how most people with depression don't have it in them to do what he does - take his meds every day, see his therapist when needed (he is only seeing her monthly now) and work toward maintaining his mental health.  And I told him he did that because he put forth in his own mind that he was capable and could and would do it.  But on the school work, he has placed a block in his mind that is must always be a chore, he must always be behind, he can't manage it.  It's not that he can't, though.  In the end, he has promised to try to do better.  And we will see.  He is already 4 lessons behind.  A bit surprising and worrisome.  But he got caught up last quarter.  He'll do it again.  Well, he's in the room now, so I'm uncomfortable writing about him - hmmmm, wonder why?  lol.  So, I'm off.

      I swear!&nbsp; I went to bed around midnight, just because I'd been running around since J got home with the car and I was needing some quiet downtime.&nbsp; R was in bed.&nbsp; J was in bed because he's working&nbsp;OT today and had to ride his bike in since we have swim team in the morning, so he was up and out the door by 4:30 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I headed to bed and walked into our bedroom to find my alarm, which has a&nbsp;phone on it, and a decorative dried flower arrangement, that is on the table behind our bed, missing.&nbsp; I walked over on my side to find them on the floor, phone off the hook and the pillow in the sham laying on top of them.&nbsp; Instead of putting my pillow in the sham at the foot of the bed (we actually lean them against the hope chest at the foot of the bed on the floor, usually) J shoved it off, taking the phone/alarm and flower arrangement with it.&nbsp; Now, I was pretty ticked off.&nbsp; I guess I would have to say that one of my pet peeves is laziness.&nbsp; I just don't see the point in it.&nbsp; It makes more work for others who clean up after the lazy person.&nbsp; It's annoying.&nbsp; It hurts the person who is lazy and it hurts the people around them in more ways than I could say - especially since I'm married to one of those kinds of people.&nbsp; I grew up being busy.&nbsp; You didn't half do things.&nbsp; You got off your patoot and&nbsp;finished, well.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;I just have a tough time with&nbsp;doing things part way or so poorly that you damage&nbsp;things.&nbsp; And an even tougher time seeing others do that within the walls of my own home.&nbsp;&nbsp;And if that were the only thing that had happened due to laziness in the last 24 hours, I probably would have just been a little upset, picked it up and gone about my business.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it wasn't the only thing - it was one of 3 things.&nbsp; And so, I woke him up and, using my sometimes cutting tongue, said something along the lines of...."How pathetic can you be to be too lazy to get off your lazy butt and move a pillow to the floor rather than shoving it, along with the alarm/phone and flowers, to the floor?!?!?!!?!"&nbsp; Of course, 3 seconds later, I was sorry I'd said anything.&nbsp; I was especially sorry I'd wakened him.&nbsp; And I figured I'd be in for it with nasty behavior from him come morning - or&nbsp;with him angrily flipping over in bed when I got in.&nbsp; But, surprisingly enough, he rolled over to me and put his arm around me when I got into bed after my shower.&nbsp; When I woke as he was getting dressed for work this morning, he said he was sorry, he was so tired and didn't even remember doing that.&nbsp; He was very nice about the whole thing.&nbsp; And I felt like a bigger schmuck than I had before I went to bed.&nbsp; Lesson learned.&nbsp; Not every thing is intentional just to drive you crazy or because someone doesn't care if they&nbsp;add to your workload.&nbsp;   Sometime within the 1st hour and a half after I'd fallen asleep (I'm sure I was out within&nbsp;10 seconds after I layed down!), R came into bed with us.&nbsp; But&nbsp;somehow, she half jumped on me to manage that.&nbsp; I recall my breast being crushed under a small hand with all it's weight on&nbsp;it........So, what did I do?&nbsp; Had another little flare of anger.&nbsp; I said, "For&nbsp;Pete's sake!&nbsp; What are you&nbsp;trying to do?&nbsp; If there isn't any room, go to the foot of the&nbsp;bed and climb up to&nbsp;the bare spot!"&nbsp;&nbsp;She did and I scooted further away from the center of the bed&nbsp;for her to manage this (she likes to sleep between Mom and Dad, of course).&nbsp; And I felt awful.&nbsp; Within a few minutes, I rolled over and cuddled her.&nbsp; But still......   Then, J leaves for work and the dog, which he said he would let out before he left,&nbsp;comes up to me whining - saying, "I gotta pee, Lady!!!!"&nbsp; So, up at 4:40 a.m. this morning to let her out and I gave up.&nbsp; I'm up.&nbsp; What the heck!&nbsp; What's the point?&nbsp; I was, again, quite irritated.&nbsp;   So, I'm wondering what's got my dander up that I'm sort of flying off the handle about some rather little&nbsp;things?&nbsp; And sitting here thinking about it this morning, I begin to sort through&nbsp;a few things.&nbsp;   1.&nbsp; I'm a bit angry at myself.&nbsp; I haven't stayed on a healthy eating plan for any length of time.&nbsp; I do well for a few days, then turn to eating something I shouldn't at the slightest tough situation or tension.&nbsp; Yet I'm completely sick of being this heavy, of having my back hurt so much, of having my knees hurt if I kneel down, of looking at this much too large body of mine in the mirror, of having clothes in my closet that I love but am too big&nbsp;to wear, of letting food control me......I could go on.&nbsp;   2.&nbsp; We don't get a vacation this year (or last.&nbsp; Or next.)&nbsp; because between J's work and school schedule, me&nbsp;having just started a new job and R's school starting in about 4 weeks, we can't seem to make everything fall into the same place for a week.&nbsp; Now, this is no tragedy.&nbsp; Lots of people don't get to take vacations.&nbsp; But we finally worked out a way to go to the mountains over night the weekend before school starts.&nbsp; We don't want to take our dog because then we can't hike (or one of us can't because we'd have to stay with the&nbsp;dog&nbsp;since you can't take them into National Parks, even on a lease, on the hiking trails).&nbsp; So, we discussed having one of the youth from church come stay the night&nbsp;or at least spend most of the day here, go home to sleep and come back early the next morning to let the dog out and run her.&nbsp; Sounds like a good plan and we thought we'd pay them $40 to make it more desirable.&nbsp; But now I have to call&nbsp;around to find this person.&nbsp; And&nbsp;for some reason, I'm having a hard time doing that.&nbsp; I keep thinking it's because I'm afraid of everyone on the list (there are&nbsp;only 3) saying no.&nbsp; Then what will we do.&nbsp; But until I find someone to watch this dog, I can't make reservations for a motel room.&nbsp; So, am I screwing myself intentionally?&nbsp; Am I just that pathetic in my self esteem right now, that I think someone will not want to do something for us, even for good pay?&nbsp; I'd don't really know, but especially, I'd like to get past this.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do owe it to my family to force myself to do this.&nbsp; And I must do so soon or we won't get to take this little trip.   3.&nbsp; Life is really erratic right now.&nbsp; I never know when I'll have work.&nbsp; Or how much.&nbsp; Or how long it will&nbsp;take me to complete it.&nbsp; My sleep schedule is all messed up.&nbsp; I feel like it's next to impossible to accomplish&nbsp;all the things I need to accomplish.&nbsp; I'm tired all the time.&nbsp; I feel like I don't have the time to exercise, plan my menus, run my errands, keep my daughter feeling loved and not ignored, clean my house, brush the cat, etc.&nbsp; My marriage is pretty.......um......sexless at the moment.&nbsp; And I miss that closeness, even though he makes me crazy sometimes.&nbsp; My hubby is on&nbsp;a slight roller coaster right now as he knows some of the guys at work are really raking in the overtime&nbsp;pay&nbsp;and he can only work so much because of school.&nbsp; If he works too much, he falls behind on homework.&nbsp; If he doesn't work any OT,&nbsp;he&nbsp;feels inadequate.&nbsp; But then, he also fights the&nbsp;part of him&nbsp;where he just doesn't want to work at all if he could&nbsp;get away with it.&nbsp; No amount of reassurance helps him feel better.&nbsp; So, he's a bit down, which always sets me on edge because I'm not fully confident that the old behaviors will not come trickling up again (and he's only seeing his therapist once a&nbsp;month now, which although a positive thing since she suggested it, leaves me pretty scared about how he'll cope without her if something comes up&nbsp;and will he lean more on me for that support and how can I possibly give it&nbsp;with everything else I'm trying to cope with and will we be okay without an outside party helping him look within and on and on......).&nbsp;   3.&nbsp; Am I still a good mom?&nbsp; I'm not there nearly as much as I used to be, or would like to be&nbsp;(and, oh how I miss those fun times of doing so much with my child and seeing her laugh and smile and be happy as we spent time together).&nbsp; We still do things.&nbsp; In fact, I managed to clean most of my house yesterday and still do a craft with her before her best friend came over for a play date.&nbsp;   4.&nbsp; Does my boss like me and still think I'm a good employee?&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually just had a positive e-mail from her&nbsp;about 1 & 1/2 weeks ago, but sometimes when I have to call about something, she seems......not herself.&nbsp; Not to have that singsong in her voice.&nbsp; So I wonder, is she irritated with me?&nbsp; Is she not happy with my work?&nbsp; Do I annoy her?&nbsp; Does&nbsp;she think I'm stupid?&nbsp; I know - probably PMS related self esteem issues.&nbsp; Paranoia, at the very least.&nbsp; But not such an unusual place for me to be, I'm sad to say.   5.&nbsp; Can I focus&nbsp;more on my spiritual side, which seems greatly lacking, with everything new I've taken on?&nbsp; I hardly find the time to pray right now.&nbsp; I rarely pull out my scriptures to read or prepare a Family Home Evening lesson.&nbsp; I dread every Saturday when I have to prepare my Sunday School lesson and iron our clothes.&nbsp; But at the same time, I'd feel lost without a class to teach or if we don't go to church (which just really isn't an option, not what I want for our family).&nbsp;   6.&nbsp; I've run late to a number of R's morning swim team classes.&nbsp; Not a lot, but a few.&nbsp; And I'm a person who really hates to be late to things.&nbsp; It's not good for a kid, either.&nbsp; It's embarrassing for them, hard for them to understand and cope with.&nbsp; I don't want to stress my girl out.&nbsp; Life is hard enough without your mom failing you.&nbsp; Hmmmm, am I being too hard on myself?   7.&nbsp; Am I being too hard on myself?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Well, that goes without saying.&nbsp; I'm my own best enemy.&nbsp; Never enough, never good enough, never helpful enough, never quick enough, never&nbsp;thorough enough, etc.&nbsp; You get the picture.&nbsp; Perfectionism is hell.&nbsp; lol.   8.&nbsp; I took Zoloft for about a year after my third miscarriage.&nbsp; It totally kills the sex drive, but I remember being soooooo even keeled (I&nbsp;don't know if I spelled that right).&nbsp; It was nice not to be affected by PMS.&nbsp; Not to feel really tense or upset about things.&nbsp; Gosh, it's almost like I miss that stuff!&nbsp; lol.&nbsp; Well, maybe just miss the calm it gave me.&nbsp;   9.&nbsp; When will I dig deep into my brain and sort through this food crap?&nbsp; How long will it take me, how old will I be, before I can see that I am heading into a very dark place if I don't do something soon?&nbsp; What is the key?&nbsp; What made me do it last time, when I lost 62 pounds and felt so good?&nbsp; How do I reach inside myself and make it so?&nbsp; Why can't I seem to do this right now, even though I know I am heading for disaster if I don't with my health going further downhill?&nbsp; What if all the miscarriages I had were related to my weight?&nbsp; How do I live with this body I feel has betrayed me in so many ways?&nbsp; Will I&nbsp;ever be happy with it?&nbsp; Will I ever reach my goal weight?&nbsp; Will I ever see the&nbsp;words 'morbidly obese' removed from my medical records?&nbsp; Can't someone jump into my body, get it in shape, and then let me have it back healthy and thin?&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess I wish there really were a magic pill because losing wieght is the hardest thing I've ever tried to do.&nbsp; I quit smoking after 14 years.&nbsp; I've changed many personality&nbsp;traits about myself that I didn't like.&nbsp; But losing weight?&nbsp; It's&nbsp;harder than anything else I have ever done.&nbsp;   Okay, I've vented.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;getting along in the morning and my alarm just went off, so I gotta go!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Ahhhhh, the wonder of a dream.&nbsp; I get my best dreams&nbsp; when&nbsp;I take a nap.&nbsp; Which I desperately needed today as I was up until 3 a.m. working!&nbsp; My doc had fallen behind on his dictation and apparently got it all done&nbsp;this weekend!&nbsp; But, it's more money for the month.&nbsp; Got up this morning at 6:30 a.m. to take R to swim team practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then J&nbsp;rode his bike to work last night so we had the car for swim team and he&nbsp;asked me to pick him up since he then goes to school tonight and on to work again.&nbsp; He works until 10 a.m., so we just left right from swim team to get him.&nbsp; Thankfully, he'll then head into his days off....from work, that is - lol.&nbsp; So, I did that, then ran to the store for some more salad and&nbsp;other healthy stuff and then&nbsp;home.&nbsp; By the time I got everything put away and we ate, I was exhausted.&nbsp; So, I layed down to nap.&nbsp; I dreamed a cleaning person came to the house while I was away doing something that seemed like work, like my job.&nbsp; I came home thinking, "Oh no.&nbsp; Now I have to manage cleaning today, too."&nbsp; But I walked in and it smelled clean!&nbsp; I looked around and it was spotless!&nbsp; I looked at the baseboards and they were pet hair free, even in their favorite place to congregate - behind the front door!&nbsp; And I smiled and felt so great!&nbsp; Then my mom was there for some reason and looked&nbsp;like she did about 10 years ago or so.&nbsp; She was bustling all around.&nbsp; Then I saw her&nbsp;shopping&nbsp;and buying some new clothes for herself.&nbsp; I ran in to her at some store in my dream, too.&nbsp; Yeah, I know.&nbsp; Makes so much sense.&nbsp; Even her hair wasn't yet all white!&nbsp; So, I take that as my sign to call her today and see if they are back from Indiana (their vacation trip).&nbsp;   So far today, no work.&nbsp; I have a couple of diskettes to look at that will have any corrections I needed to make on them (hopefully very few now).&nbsp; Other than that, I think I can just focus on this house which, by the way, "wasn't" miraculously cleaned by someone else - LOL.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Okay, doesn't everyone deserve a weekend once in a while to do nothing?&nbsp; I can't remember the last one I had.&nbsp; Maybe that's just bad memory or maybe it's really been a while.&nbsp; I took the whole....the whole weekend off.&nbsp;&nbsp;We didn't even go to church, which is very rare.&nbsp; But I just really felt a need to not have obligations this weekend.&nbsp; And since I teach, it was a nice break.  On Saturday, when J got home&nbsp;from school, R and I went to the library and checked out some more books and she turned in her finished Summer Reading Program stuff.&nbsp; All told, she's read a whole lot of books so far this summer.&nbsp; I'd say, between what she has read on her own, which is the majority of them, and what I have read to her at bedtime each night, we've probably read a good&nbsp;70 books or&nbsp;so.&nbsp; Even th0ugh she's done with the program, we checked out some&nbsp;more.&nbsp; Aside from that outing, I've been lazing around reading and watching a video series I checked out.&nbsp; Now, of course I've done dishes, cooked, etc., but nothing major.&nbsp; I had finished the Fishers of Men book and&nbsp;this morning finished the Stephen King book, Song of Susannah.&nbsp;  When we went to the library, I wanted to see what they had on some of the PBS (Pulic Broadcasting Service for you out of&nbsp;country folks)&nbsp;&nbsp;Old West programs.&nbsp; I think most of those who know me know I&nbsp;have been interested in the Old West for many years.&nbsp; I've been working on an historical western novel for years (geez, I wish I had time to write more - it's one of the things I'd planned to do when R went full time into school.&nbsp; But, alas, I am working instead).&nbsp; I've done tons of research over the years for it and then found out about these PBS shows that had been running.&nbsp; They are sort of reality shows, I guess.&nbsp; One that I'm watching in rerun on Thursday nights is called, "Pioneer Quest:&nbsp; A Year in the Real West".&nbsp; Having watched the first&nbsp;2 of the 3 that have run (I missed the first one), I think the&nbsp;subtitle should have&nbsp;been "A Year in Hell".&nbsp; These people are in Canada in the wilderness somewhere and come out on a wagon with authentic&nbsp;euipment and supplies for the 1800's (can't recall exactly when).&nbsp; They have to clear the land, build homes, plant crops and it's been&nbsp;the rainest season (at the time of this filming) in about 100 years.&nbsp; They are coping with ticks, mosquitoes, rain, rain, rain, mold, living in a tent - six weeks for one couple, 11 weeks for the other.&nbsp; It's just total hell, but it's the way it really was for the pioneers.&nbsp; You have to admire them (the pioneers.&nbsp; These people are doing it for $100,000).&nbsp; Anyway, PBS also did a&nbsp;similar thing called Frontier House in Montana.&nbsp; Three families were chosen and their homesteads were in various degrees of readiness for them.&nbsp; This is what I rented from the libaray and watched on Saturday night after I put R to bed.&nbsp; I was up a bit late, seeing as there are 3 VHS and they are each&nbsp;about 4 hours long.&nbsp; But it was worth it!&nbsp; You get the idea of what this romantizied era was truly like&nbsp;and one thing I can tell you is:&nbsp; No Way Would I&nbsp;Have Wanted To Live Then!&nbsp; I probably would not have survived to adulthood, anyway.&nbsp; And the average age people lived to then was only in their 40's!&nbsp; Now our average lifespan is 77.&nbsp; But once you see how hard they had to work, how much they had to cope with, the times food was scarce and they went hungry, the dangers just getting out west, let alone setting up your homestead......It's a wonder they lived as long as they did.&nbsp; And, of course,&nbsp;many of them didn't, especially children.&nbsp; I consider it some exceptionally good learning for my novel - some day when I get to it again.&nbsp;   I guess I must be tired because I just ran out of steam.&nbsp; I'm brain dead.&nbsp; One of these days, I&nbsp;'ll get to this early enough to finish all my thought.......&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;

      I didn't get any work this morning and nothing else has come in so far today, but that's okay.&nbsp; I've been reading that book I mentioned in an earlier post, Fishers of Men by Gerald Lund.&nbsp; I was able to finish it this morning!&nbsp; So that was nice.&nbsp; And I can get started on the&nbsp;next one in the series of 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus, the new Stephen King book in his Dark Tower series just came out.&nbsp; We bought it&nbsp;&nbsp;and J read it first.&nbsp; He&nbsp;finished it and has&nbsp;been&nbsp;taunted me about how&nbsp;good it was.&nbsp; Like the Harry Potter series, there are 7 books in total planned (only not so like Harry Potter - lol)&nbsp;.&nbsp; This one was the&nbsp;6th book.&nbsp; We do read a lot of his books - not that I think they are the best because he uses&nbsp;quite a bit of bad language in them - but he is a good writer and most of them are good stories.&nbsp; How many of us haven't either read the book or seen the movie Salem's Lot?&nbsp; Unless you totally can't take scary movies or stories.&nbsp; But the Dark Tower series is much more&nbsp;SciFi than it is horror - in fact, a lot of his are.&nbsp; And we've really been in to it from way back when he wrote the first one many years ago.&nbsp; So, I actually couldn't stand&nbsp;it and started reading it&nbsp;before I finished the other book (but then, I have been&nbsp;known to have 4 or 5 books going at a time.&nbsp; When I get sick of it taking so long, I pick the one I'm almost done with and finish it, then work my way through the&nbsp;group, only to start the whole cycle again a bit later).&nbsp; Now I'll rush to finish it so I can move on to the next Gerald Lund book.&nbsp;   J&nbsp;started a new shift this past week.&nbsp;&nbsp;It works better for school for him, I guess -&nbsp;although really, what is going to work 'well'.&nbsp; Now he goes in to work on Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tues.&nbsp;at midnight.&nbsp; Then he still has school on Tues & Thurs. evenings and Saturday mornings.&nbsp; Honestly, it's like we never see each other now.&nbsp; Often when he is home, I'm working.&nbsp; But, I suppose we just have to adjust.&nbsp; I can feel the distance, though.  R is doing great with swimming still.&nbsp; She's been improving a lot at each swim team class.&nbsp; But I think she is bored and ready to go back to school.&nbsp; We are limited in what we can do now, too, with just one car as J often has it at work.&nbsp; His idea of riding "almost all the time" dwindled pretty fast.&nbsp; Not that I begrudge him the car.&nbsp; It's just a difficult adjustment.&nbsp; R and I are a bit trapped without it.&nbsp; No one lives "close" here and&nbsp;the library is&nbsp;several miles away.&nbsp; So, we have been doing things here at home and growing a bit more bored.&nbsp; It's hard when you can't get out and about at will.&nbsp; But, again, we'll adjust.  Got a new quote:&nbsp;&nbsp; "You try, you fail.&nbsp; You try, you fail.&nbsp; But the only real failure is when you stop trying!"&nbsp; Gypsy Woman from Haunted Mansion  I like the quoter as well as the quote - lol.  Well, I think I am going to go back to my reading.........&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Nine years ago, Jay and I bought two floor lamps for our living room,&nbsp; one on each side (when we moved in here).&nbsp; They are gold toned and have movable arms to swing the light out over a chair or whatever.&nbsp; I've always liked them and only had to replace the lampshades twice before.&nbsp; Well, last week, the lamp behind my rocker just fell over!!&nbsp; The base had some sort of stone in it and just broke from&nbsp;weakness, I guess.&nbsp; So I started looking around, not wanting to buy two lamps, if I could find a match.&nbsp; Well, we bought them *9* years ago!&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; But, not to be detered,&nbsp;I looked and looked for a match or even a similar one that would work.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; Then I recalled that we bought the original ones at a K-Mart way back when (which I never really go to anymore).&nbsp; So I thought, "What the heck!&nbsp; Let's look there."&nbsp; The nearest K-Mart is now&nbsp;on the north side of town - not any hour long drive, but a ways off.&nbsp; But sure enough, there was an almost exact lamp!&nbsp; And for only $20.00!&nbsp; We bought it.&nbsp; It came with a linen-I-don't-like-it shade, so&nbsp;I bought one I thought looked close to the other (the one on the broken lamp was broken by J when he tossed it outside&nbsp;- after I asked him not to leave it sitting on the diningroom table after he'd attempted to 'repair' the old lamp).&nbsp; Grrrr.&nbsp; Anyway, the lamp shades don't match&nbsp;but the lamps are only&nbsp;slightly different, so I'll just go pick up another lamp shade in a couple of weeks.&nbsp; Now I can read&nbsp;when I'm sitting in my rocker again!&nbsp;&nbsp;Yippee!!&nbsp;  &nbsp; I don't know if I mentioned this new digital system my boss is going to start me on, but it's done from a website.&nbsp; All I need is speakers (with a headset plug in - something mine didn't have) and a foot pedal she is supplying.&nbsp; We picked up some inexpensive, but really rather nice speakers, with a headset plug in and a nice headset.&nbsp; Partial write offs come tax time since it was for my job.&nbsp; And very nice sound through both.&nbsp; I'm pretty happy with them.&nbsp; Now I'm all set when she gets around to starting me on it. &nbsp; I didn't clean house today, afterall, even though I didn't get any work today.&nbsp; We had these errands to run and I picked up and hauled together the trash and did up all the dishes and such instead.&nbsp; And honestly, I didn't want to go through the back pain as severe as it was last time I cleaned.&nbsp; So, I'll get to it later this week or this weekend, depending on my time frame.&nbsp; And J and I are planning a date night to finally celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary that was back on July 4th.&nbsp; We're thinking about the Boulder Dinner Playhouse which has Cabaret right now.&nbsp; That would be so much fun.&nbsp; The Country Dinner Playhouse, which is not as far&nbsp;but not quite as nice (or expensive), has South Pacific, which would also be fun.&nbsp; I'd be happy with either, but Saint Mike Rosen (as we refer to him since&nbsp;J thinks he is next to God....) talks about the Boulder Dinner&nbsp;Playhouse and advertises it on his radio show ***rolling my eyes****, so J really wants to go there.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Saint has actually gotten us in trouble a number of times (me not feeling I had a big voice since I wasn't working all these years).&nbsp; We used a 'mortgage broker' to refinance one time, instead of just refinancing with our original company and ended up paying a good $600-700. more for&nbsp;it (not to mention our mortgage was sold to 3 different companies during that time - we never knew who to send a check to).&nbsp; We bought that&nbsp;stupid 'hey-idiot-my-transmission-is-going-out' wagon from a trashy car place called Rocky's Autos - I'd die before I'd buy another car from them!&nbsp; After buying it, I took it to a shop because I knew something was wrong with it and sure enough, the tranny was going out.&nbsp; We took it back (they refused to accept it but said they'd put a new one in for free and we didn't know the law about the 3 day thing - thought that was just on new cars).&nbsp; We got it back with the 'new' tranny which proceeded to blow out 1 week after the guarantee was expired!&nbsp; Not to mention the constant repairs we were making on it.&nbsp; What a piece of junk!&nbsp; And I am quite sure their lot is filled with a lot of cars just like that one.&nbsp; We also tried a restaurant he 'endorsed' that was just awful (except to Saint Mike's&nbsp;loyal disciple - J).&nbsp; And I was fair. I didn't know he'd advertized it until I was eating there and told J it wasn't very good.&nbsp; So, I tend to just prefer to avoid anything The Saint advises.&nbsp; Oh, how can I forget!&nbsp; We've bought 2 beds at a place he advertises and endorses, too.&nbsp; The second one was good.&nbsp; The first was not so good.&nbsp; Okay, enough coming down on The Saint, poor guy probably would go off on me - he's a&nbsp;conservative radio talk show host that J loves to listen to.&nbsp; And I agree with a lot of his politics, but not all.&nbsp; And not his endorsed products!&nbsp; lol. &nbsp; My mom called from Indiana yesterday to let us know they were having a good time.&nbsp; My Aunt is just as energetic as they come.&nbsp; She's 80 and plays&nbsp;banjo and sings&nbsp;at these county fairs and&nbsp;keeps an exhausting schedule.&nbsp; My mom and dad were staying home Sunday to rest while she went to yet another one.&nbsp; She's amazing!&nbsp; She was the county treasurer there for many years.&nbsp; My mom had told me it was State treasurer, but no, county.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the same, she was very&nbsp;involved in politics until she retired in her late&nbsp;60's.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, they are having a great time but said my cousin, mom and my aunt's age, is in the hospital again.&nbsp; She's having some trouble keeping her food in her and they don't know what's wrong.&nbsp; She, mom&nbsp;and my aunt all hung out like sisters while growing up.&nbsp; So, this is hard for my mom.&nbsp; She's pretty worried.&nbsp; But, we're hoping they can figure out what's wrong and help her get better soon.&nbsp; Her husband has many health problems and is in a wheelchair.&nbsp; He relies on her a lot.&nbsp; So, hopefully, everything will work out for the best. &nbsp; Well, I need to spend as much time with my baby girl as I can before I get&nbsp;swamped with work and all.&nbsp; She's in need of cuddles and book reading, I think.&nbsp; Peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      After I&nbsp;read my previous post and then read a comment on it, I thought, "Hmmm, it sounds like I was really tooting my own horn!"&nbsp; But when I read that article - at this point in my life when I'm feeling overwhelmed by returning to work and feeling inadequate as a mother to my precious daughter - it reaffirmed for me that I was doing a good job.&nbsp; I was hanging in there and putting forth a lot to be a good mom.&nbsp; That at least until this point in my life, R has been the main focus of my life, and I have done a good job.&nbsp; That what exists between R and I is not just by chance.&nbsp; It was a specific plan that we be mother and daughter.&nbsp; We have worked to be close.&nbsp; I have worked to&nbsp;meet all of her needs all her short life so far and will continue to do so to the best of my ability.&nbsp; She has worked to show me her love back and to try to behave well (which she does 90% of the time - lol).&nbsp; But none of it is really work.&nbsp; It's just love.&nbsp; And service to one another. &nbsp; Our church teaches a lot about service.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Book of Mormon, Mosiah 2:17, it says: &nbsp; And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.&nbsp; &nbsp; I&nbsp;guess I don't really think about that when I do things for my family, friends, strangers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think more about trying to put myself in their situation - teens in a broken down car, a mother with an upset child who seems to be breaking down in her patience, a&nbsp;friend moving and packing without help, a sick friend with a family to feed and a house to clean........ those sorts of things.&nbsp; I have often told J that even though we don't have any family really close by, we are not alone because we have our church family.&nbsp; When my parents, sister, brother-in-law and nephews moved to Texas, people from our church were there to help them unload and move things around in the house.&nbsp; My brother-in-law had back surgery and people from church came and kept up the yard while he was unable to (keeping in mind that my parents are members of our church but mostly inactive and my sister and her family are not members at all, so it's not just something done for other members of our church).&nbsp; When I was on bed rest&nbsp;before R was born, meals were brought into our house by the women in our church.&nbsp; And I could go on.&nbsp; All of this being service to others.&nbsp; It's a wonderful feeling to know that no matter where we might go in the world, we will have 'family'&nbsp;nearby. &nbsp; On to other things: My boss decided to change, once again, what I'll be doing.&nbsp; I'm not entirely sure I'll still be&nbsp;doing transcribing for the chiro, although when I asked, she said I would.&nbsp; I'll still be doing the transcribing for the one dermatologist, but instead of doing some other digital stuff on a different machine, I'll be taking on a new part time dermatologist and doing that transcribing, too.&nbsp; I'll still be moving to digital, but it's on-line via a website, so no machine to clutter up my very small&nbsp;desk.&nbsp; Just a footpedal that controls play, rewind, fast forward.&nbsp; And I think we'll have to buy new speakers for my computer so I have the ability to use headphones.&nbsp; Otherwise, I can just here the conflict as J and&nbsp;R are trying to watch TV and I'm trying to transcribe.&nbsp; So, we'll see how that goes.&nbsp; And I am starting to feel a bit more comfortable with this derm, although he is still hard to understand.&nbsp; I've been describing him as&nbsp;dictating like the fast talking guy on the Federal Express commercials.&nbsp; No kidding.&nbsp; He's almost&nbsp;that&nbsp;darn fast&nbsp;through most of his dictating.&nbsp; But I'm learning a lot and noticed a mole on a kid's back that&nbsp;is on the swim team while we were&nbsp;at the swim meet and I mentioned to one of the instructors who knows his family really well that they should have it checked - lol.&nbsp; Before doing this derm, I don't think I would have ever even noticed something like that.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Well, time to get to my Sunday School lesson.&nbsp; Tonight we go to a pizza&nbsp;party for our friend's son (the friends that are moving to Texas&nbsp;this summer) because K is leaving early for Texas and staying with his aunt and uncle and 7 cousins (one more on the way) there.&nbsp; His mom will stay here another 4-5 weeks and then she'll move down there, even if their home hasn't sold as they'll live with her sister until it does.&nbsp; And, of course, her husband, M, is back in Iraq working.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Oh, J's lost some weight with not having a car!&nbsp; He's down about 10 pounds so far!&nbsp; Now I've got to do the same.&nbsp; And I will.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      My oldest sister writes a column for her local newspaper, The Greeley Tribune, twice a month.&nbsp; She's written it for years and touches on many subjects.&nbsp; Being an elementary school&nbsp;teacher, many of her articles are about teaching, kids, experiences she's had with students, etc.&nbsp; But sometimes she writes about her family - like the article about my dad being in the Army and how we were raised to be very patriotic.&nbsp; Not long after R was born, she wrote about us - R and I.&nbsp; I have a copy of that article in R's baby book and in a file in my cabinet.&nbsp; I also carry one with me in my purse, which is worn in some placed and beginning to fall apart.&nbsp; I'd forgotten about it.&nbsp; I pulled it out on Sunday to make a note on it, not knowing what it was (but my little notepad I keep in there was conspicuously missing).&nbsp; Today, as I was transferring those notes to my daytimer, I opened the paper and saw what it was.&nbsp; When I read it, I cried.&nbsp; It made me remember holding R when she was a baby.&nbsp; And I realize how proud&nbsp;I am of the little girl I've been raising and devoting my time to.&nbsp; She has been and will always be so very worth it.&nbsp; Anyway, I&nbsp;wanted to share it.&nbsp; I've replaced R's name with the R, just as I usually do.&nbsp; Otherwise, it's word for word.&nbsp;&nbsp;So here it is: &nbsp; Gerber-beautiful Baby is Her Mother's Absolute Joy&nbsp; by Vicki Heisler&nbsp; Sunday July 20, 1997 (subtitled: Niece shines on everyone around her) &nbsp; There are three of us.&nbsp; I am&nbsp;the oldest girl (followed by two brothers, two and four years younger than me).&nbsp; Kerri is the middle sister, nine years younger, and Kandi is the youngest of us all, 10 years younger than me. &nbsp; As we were growing up, we each found our identity and niche in the family.&nbsp; I was reclusive and bookish.&nbsp; Kandi, everybody's baby, was brash and adventurous.&nbsp; Kerri was all girl.&nbsp; Pale-complected with strawberry-blonde&nbsp;ringlets, she could often be found in some remote corner playing at an elaborate fantasy of "house". &nbsp; When someone&nbsp;asked, I would tell them&nbsp;that I planned to be a scientist or a teacher.&nbsp; Kandi's answers would have been more varied and would have included some non-traditional careers. &nbsp; Kerri would not have hesitated for a heartbeat.&nbsp; Her answer was as simple as could be.&nbsp; She wanted to be a mother. &nbsp; Years passed, as they always do, and our lives began to take shape.&nbsp; I married at 19, quite in opposition to my imagined life of single adoption, had two sons and became the teacher of which I had dreamed.&nbsp; Then Kandi married in her 20's and birthed a son, a career in teaching and a love affair with English literature.&nbsp; For Kerri, there were odd jobs for several years before she found a challenging job in the insurance industry, but her dream of motherhood seemed far away.&nbsp; Last November, at 35, Kerri finally realized her dream.&nbsp; My niece, R_____, was born to Kerri and her husband, J___.  &nbsp; To see Kerri with her daughter is absolute joy.&nbsp; This baby, so wanted and so loved, is the clear focus of her mother's life (which is, incidentally, not to diminish in the least my brother-in-law's devotion to his child).&nbsp; R_____ is all smiles and easygoing alertness.&nbsp; When she is with her family, our facial muscles ache for a week from all the laughter she brings.&nbsp; She is Gerber-baby beautiful, but it is her sweet disposition and jolly take on the world that shines on everyone around her. &nbsp; I love to watch my sister as she plays her mother role.&nbsp; I love to listen to her voice.&nbsp; It is a lovely dance she does with her daughter, full of a wisdom that some might think is instinctive.&nbsp; I know better.&nbsp; Everything my sister does and says to her baby is based on an awareness of the need of a child for a loving caregiver whose days and nights are focused on giving her what she needs.&nbsp; This is intentional parenting of the richest kind. &nbsp; R____and Kerri are in constant touch - literally.&nbsp; Kerri is responsive to R____'s cries or babbles.&nbsp; I watch her gauge the intensity of R_____'s communication and gracefully decide what is best to do.&nbsp; R_____ rarely cries because her mother is so conscientious and conscious of her needs.&nbsp; R______ is held often, rocked and sung to, swiftly comforted when there is pain or irritation.&nbsp; She is given space to explore and interesting objects to play with. &nbsp; R____ and Kerri are in constant conversation.&nbsp; R_____'s babblings and cries are part of the rich discourse, as are her mother's narration of experience and calm, unhurried tone. &nbsp; I love to watch R_______'s facial expressions as she mimics and responds to Kerri.&nbsp; Kerri is masterful at motherese, that altered language that we know is the best way to build a baby's vocabulary and ability to learn.&nbsp; Kerri, for her part, is able to sneak in some linguistic challenges that keep R______ learning and&nbsp;growing. &nbsp; When we sisters, all mothers now, get together to talk about the challenges and joys of parenting, we agree on many things.&nbsp; We know it is vitally important that our children were and are very much wanted.&nbsp; Although there have been a few surprises in the timing of their arrivals, our children arrived eagerly awaited.&nbsp; Our&nbsp;children were born to mothers who were adults.&nbsp; Despite my early marriage, my children were not born until I was 27 and 31 respectively.&nbsp; My nephew's mother was 29 when he was born and Kerri was 35 when R_______&nbsp;arrived.&nbsp; We had all done a lot of growing up before we had to help a child grow. &nbsp; We also recognize the imporant role our mother played in teaching us, through example, how to be good mothers.&nbsp; I am the luckiest of all because I had her example and two little girls to try her techniqes on while I was still very young.&nbsp; It helps to practie parental behaviors in the safety of your parents' home. &nbsp; If I could have a wish fulfilled for children everywhere, it would be that they have parents who long for them and who are eager for the wonder that&nbsp;is parenthood.&nbsp; I would wish that every parent would have a positive parent in his or her childhood to emulate and love.&nbsp; I would wish that parents could focus on their children while they are very young without&nbsp;fear of economic disaster or career repercussions.&nbsp; I would wish that all mothers and babies could engage each other in the lovely dance that I see my sister and her daughter do. &nbsp; Watching them together is seeing dreams realized, love made tangible and heaven here on earth.&nbsp; When my sister holds her daughter, she sees an angel in her arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing them together, I see two.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      It's terribly late, but I'm worried about how much work I'll be getting this week (watch, there won't be squat - lol), so I'm blogging tonight in case it's my only chance this week.  I've been busy, but every night I try to read a little bit in a book I've been interested in.  It's actually the first book in a series.  The series is called The Kingdom and The Crown and the author is Gerald Lund.  The first book, which I'm reading now, is called Fisher's of Men.  Now, obviously, it's a scripturally based novel.  The author is a religious scholar and researched endlessly, then filled in the story.  Of course, it's about people who lived while Christ was on the earth - many of them familiar people from that time and some of them fictional for the purpose of the story.  But I'm learning some amazing things - like the difference between the Pharisees and the Sadducees - and the different beliefs between them, the "common" jewish people and the Romans at that time.  I also have a special place in my heart for one of the original Apostles, Simon Peter.  I don't really know why, but I think it is because Christ called him "the rock" and Simon Peter was a big, strong man.  I actually love to teach about the first Apostles, especially since my mother gave me a set of paintings done by an artist, a woman, who wanted to paint what she beleived the Apostles would have looked like.  She prayed about it, then would go out and look for whatever Apostle she was planning to paint.  When she found the right man, she would ask him to allow her to paint him.  When you see the paintings and know the stories of each of them, they just seem soooooo right.  I love those pictures.  And they are just beginning to come into the book - Andrew being the first of them to see, and believe, in Jesus Christ (and Andrew was Simon Peter's brother).  It's really grabbed my attention and I read it.....in the library.....lol....prior to my shower each night.  I think I'm almost halfway through it now.  There are two other novels in the series.  I'm really enjoying it and excited to move on to the others when I finish this one.  So, anyone want to comment in my "comments" section about what you're reading these days????  I'm really having some major problems with my back.  I've had a back problem, chronic, since I was about 16 years old, a couple of years after my first injury.  At about 14, my brother (the one that's married) was messing around or maybe we were fighting - I really can't remember after all these years - but he pushed me into a divider in our house the caused my lower back to pop and hurt for a couple of weeks.  Badly for a day or two, but sore for a few weeks.  Then, when about 16, I fell and the same thing happened.  At 17, I was in a terrible and....unkind relationship........ and that person shoved me into the footboard of a bed which I landed on at the small of my back.  Later that same year, another fall on ice.  There have been others over the years, too.  In addition to those actual injuries, because I was tall, my posture was poor as a teen.  Over the years, my back being weak there, my posture has not been very good and so I've had a lot of pain there, too.  I don't ever NOT have pain (except a couple of years in my 20's when I saw a chiro regularly), but when it's very painful, it's hard to cope with.  I'm hoping I can see a chiro in another month or two.  Our insurance doesn't cover squat on seeing one, but I really think I'll get my best relief that way.  So, hopefully soon.  Wow, I'm suddenly hit with being really tired - rather common these days.  I'm off to bed.

      This came from Bev's blog and cracked me up.  Her's was totally accurate for her personality.  I'm still debating on mine - can I be honest about it?  lol.  It's called 20 Questions to a Better Personality:  Wackiness: 50/100 Rationality: 40/100 Constructiveness: 40/100 Leadership: 38/100    You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.  You are not to be messed with. You may explode.   I'm having to question how accurate the middle paragraph is as I do think most of my long time friends know me pretty well and I don't think I control my face all that well....well, maybe in some cases, actually.  But, I do prefer to observe (love watching people), calculate, discern and decide.  And, yeah, I like to be right.  But I can take it when I'm not.  Evil Genius.  Yes.....I like it......mouhahahahaha!  If you'd like to steal from my blog, here's the url:  http://hokev.brinkster.net/quiz/default.asp?quiz=Better%2BPersonality&page=6&re=4&cd=2.5&lf=1&ws=2.5   Interesting little quiz.  I am surprised I'm still up.  I had about 3 hours of sleep last night and then spent all day at R's swim meet.  She did really well.  She competed in the Free style first and came in about 3rd, I think (it's non-competitive, so they don't keep track) and then in breaststroke and she came in 2nd, I think.  She was very pleased with herself, too.  We can't participate in the other two as they are both on Sunday's.  But, R wasn't upset about it since she did this one.  She fell asleep in the car on the way home - a very rare thing for her.  I, unfortunately, also almost fell asleep on the way home, too - but I WAS DRIVING!!!  I was so grateful to pull into the parking space at home!  And we were way over on the west side of the Denver Metro area - very near the mountains and R was very excited about that.  We were actually in the foothills (what Easterns call mountains but they are actually foothills here - lol).  Anyway, it was a long drive and I am not comfortable in the area between where we were and home, so didn't want to have to pull over to sleep if I could help it.  But it was a tough drive home.  Fun day, though.  Got my transcription done for Monday late tonight and I just finished my Sunday School lesson.  I'll just have to iron the clothes in the morning, because I'm pooped!  Have you ever been so tired, so in need of sleep, you feel physically sick or light headed?  That's me rather often these days.    Talked to J yesterday because I was so sick of hearing, "What were you planning on making for dinner?" when I was in the middle of working for 10 or 12 hours straight that I was ready to strangle someone.....ahem.  So, I let it all pour out (which I paid for with a foul mood from him for the remainder of the day - no talking to me, ignoring R, when he did speak, he exploded, etc.).  But I was just so sick of it - like a certain someone's legs were broken or something!  And then (Drum roll)..................miracles do happen!  He made dinner tonight and last night!!!!!!  It was amazing.  He even included a veggie tonight!  Plus the dishes were all done.  And R got her bath and was put to bed (which he actual does do more times than not when I'm busy or I ask for a night off).  Then he promptly went to bed!  lol.  Men!  They just can't take it.  We are, indeed, the stronger sex, no doubt about it - lol.  Actually, I suspect he's a little ticked off at me.  He's not liking my working in the sense that I'm not able to do everything here at home and he has had to start helping quite a lot.  But, it's got to be and he's going to have to adjust.  Just as R has had to adjust to it.  I just can't do it all.  And I feel guilty about that.  I wish I could manage it all.  But I won't put my health on the back burner anymore, either, and I have to work when work is here.  I was upset that I got a tape on Friday since my parents were still in town and wanted R and I to come down to the Springs to visit all day with them.  But I was more upset when I found out it was the Dermatologist because that takes me so much longer than the chiro.  And I missed seeing my parents on Friday in the Springs or meeting them in Greeley tonight before they head for Indiana in the morning.  But, it's not like I've been working for her for a year (or even 6 months) and could say, "I need a couple of days off because my parents are in town".  It's just something we all have to adjust to.  It will be worth it went the paycheck comes in and we make a significant jump in catching things up.  Okay, my thought process is going down.  Off to bed.

      Heh.  I work at home, so who really cares about 9 to 5.  Just no weekends, please!    R watches a show called Kim Possible about a teenage....secret agent, I guess is what she is.  Anyway, she has this pal, Ron Stoppable, who has a Naked Mole Rat for a pet named Rufus.  Now they do this song about Rufus, who is like a super cool critter, that goes like this: Hey! What's that? What's that freaky thing?  A Naked Mole Rat! So every time I hear or read "What's That?" I think of that darn song.  Don't you hate when that happens?!?!  lol.  I had work yesterday and I'm happy to say that it went a little quicker then usual.  I was glad of that.  I didn't have any today and my boss is checking to see if he has something for me for in the morning when she runs by his office tonight.  I like doing these transcriptions because they are pretty wordy and the more words, the more money.  But I think I'll only be working about 3 days a week over the summer - which is perfect.  Come time for R to be back in school and I'll want to be full time.  But for now, this is okay.  My other issue is while listening and transcribing, I can feel the insurance adjuster coming out in me.  It's really pretty awful because I often roll my eyes at the new "complaints" a patient has.  But I know that comes from handling claims and there being so much fraud in that line of work.  If you're an honest person (which I know my pals reading this are!), you don't really think that way.  But you'd be very surprised how many people do.  Even people you don't expect it from.  I had a very bad attitude about people in general when I left that job.  It used to drive J crazy because I just didn't have a lot of faith in the goodness of people, so I didn't trust them very much.    Okay, here's one story about a claim that surprised me - by the dishonesty and stupidity of the insured.  We got a call from an elderly man who said he'd been robbed, had called the police and then was told by a neighbor 8 months later that he should file a claim with his insurance.  I took his recorded statement.  He knew he was being recorded, so he knew any lies would be on record.  He proceeded to tell me how he'd been out and it was snowing, a light dusting on the ground.  When he came home, he noticed he'd been robbed.  He called the police right away and they took a report and investigated.  This happened, according to him, on January 2 of whatever year that was.  I asked what was missing and he began to give me a long list.  He said he was a singer back in his younger days and they stole all his rhinestone western outfits - of which he provided xeroxed photos - his instruments, of which he sent photos of two but said there were 5, etc.  Then he said they took his TV, stereo (okay, this is more believable), microwave, pots and pans, china, sofa, 5 guns of various type, even his underwear!  That's right.  His underwear.  Okay, you can probably see this is pretty far out there and had I not stopped him, who knows where it would have gone.  I asked him if there was evidence of a truck pulling up to his residence because that's what it would take to steal all that unless it was a large group.  What theif would steal clothing?  Maybe a woman taking an expensive gown.  But a guy taking mens clothing????  And underwear????  I don't think so.  Nor pots and pans.  Or china, unless is was a special, expensive set - but this old man was living in a little trailer, as I recall.  Well, the police report came in two weeks later and, low and behold, there was one set of tracks leaving the house (meaning one guy) which the police followed and caught the one theif who had only stolen a shotgun.  And the icing on the cake, it actually happened in December, 2 days before we had a policy with him.  When I called him, he was mad, said the police were lieing, the date was wrong, etc.  I called his previous carrier and warned them because he said he was going to file with them and why let someone like that waste other's time and effort to investigate?  Even sent them a copy of the police report.  Since there was no damage and everything - the gun - was recovered, there was no claim.  That was a very typical situation, just variations in the insured or claimants level of intelligence.  Pretty sad statement if you ask me.  I'm popped.  I'm gonna take a nap.  Probably write more tonight.

      I'm a homebody, deep down.  I like to go places here and there, now and then.  But then I want to be at home.  R and J are both that way, too.  Sometimes I get sick of going and going.  And it's exhausting to go all the time.  So, today, we stayed home.  Our July 4th weekend has been busy.  First, we went to see fireworks on Friday because that night worked best for us and, luckily, a suburb nearby had them that night.  Then we came home exhausted.  We got up early the next day - J to school, R and I to meet her friend at the library for the Independence Day Bike Parade.  After that, we came home to wait for my brother to show up and he had my parents in tow from Texas (whom we'd not seen since my nieces Sept. wedding and prior to that, for almost two years).  We spent the day, late into the night, visiting.  They left and I prepared my Sunday School lesson while J put R to bath, then bed.  Sunday was church, then to our friend's house for dinner (not J, though, who had to get some sleep for work).  After dinner, we went to the church parking lot - of all places - and set off the mild fireworks K had purchased.  The kids had a blast.  Came home and picked up J and drove him and his bike to work.  Monday, I found out I didn't have any work coming in, so I called my brother and they were all going to Greeley to see my oldest sister & her hubby.  It's about 1 & 1/2 hours from here.  Surprised her with my parents being here and then talked for a long time, went out to eat and talked some more, went to their house to see all the changes since they became empty nesters and drove home very late.  Got R into bed and showered and fell into bed myself.  This morning I attempted to get up at 5:30.  Wasn't gonna happen.  I got up at 6:45 and asked R if she was up to swim team, realizing if I were this tired, she likely was, too.  Now this is a kid that LOVES swimming.  Her response was, "Please, Momma.  I need to sleep."  So, back to bed we went (after I fed the "I think I'm dying of starvation" cat and let the dog out).  We slept until 9:30, then I got up to check for work (it gets dropped in a container outside my home).  Empty.  Fed R and sat down to drink some water.  I was all dressed to work out.  I promptly fell asleep and stayed there until 11:00.  Owwwwww, my neck and back were killing me.  Finally, I got up and worked out, ate breakfast and then spent some time with R who had been watching TV, playing, reading while I was asleep.  The little doll!  Well, tomorrow I have work coming in - it's almost certain.  So, I'll work all day, I'm sure, and squeeze in some time for R and swim team practice Wed. evening.  In the meantime, I'm looking at my house (doing things here and there)thinking, "Is this bad enough to draw bugs?"  LOL.  No, but it's bad enough to really bother me.  When or when do I fit in a thourough cleaning?????  Oh, well.  This too will find a way to be managed.

      What is it about a weekend that can make you foolishly get less sleep than you should?  But it's been fun so far.  Last night we went to Glendale for their city fireworks.  It works out perfect for us to be 3 days early because J works on Sunday night.  So, we were out late at a park and R made a friend, of course.  My little social butterfly - so unlike her momma in that regard.  There were all these little fruit bats flying all over the place, eating up the bugs - Go Bats, Go!  R and this little girl she met were chasing them (at my suggesting, knowing full well they would never be able to get near them).  As the fireworks began, the bats parked themselves in the trees.  They had just cut the grass at the park, too, so I was itching all over my feet (just had a pair of flip flops on - I know....Hello?  West Nile Virus?).  But, we had fun.  J and I sat in our lawn chairs and held hands and talked and laughed while R played.  It was a nice way to start off this special weekend as our anniversary is the 4th.  Hard to believe, but we will have survived 10 years on Sunday.  The fireworks were really pretty and we came home and put a very sleepy, fussy 7 year old to bed.  Then we foolishly sat up talking more - only to have J sleep through his alarm this morning.  Wouldn't be a big deal normally, but his car ended it's life yesterday and he is having to take the RTD bus system and ride his bike to work and school until we can afford a used car - this is months away.  He's actually pretty happy about it as he's been hating his car and just waiting for it to die for a long time.  And I'm secretly happy because it will force him to exercise and that, hopefully, will bring his sugars down.    Well, I got interrupted here and it is now late - around 9:30 p.m.  I decorated R's bike for her last night as we went to the library for a special "bike parade" they were doing as part of the Summer Reading Program for The Fourth of July.  My brother, from the Springs, had called and said he'd be coming up to see R (she and he have a wonderful, close bond)and he'd be here around noon.  So, R made a flag and noise maker for craft projects at the library and then played with her friend, RH, for a little bit after the parade and then we headed home.  About 1/2 an hour later, I was doing some quick clean up things around the house (specifically the litter box) when our dog started barking like crazy.  I looked up and saw K coming toward the door, so I called for R to open the door for him while I finished up.  Then I hurried and while I was rushing to wash my hands, I heard R yell, "And Grandma and Grandpa, too!!!!!"  Well, I hurried around the corner, and sure enough, my parents were here from Texas!  I didn't expect this because my mom had been saying her health was too bad to make any trips here.  I started crying as I hugged her and Dad, and Mom was crying, too.  We got settled and talked and laughed and had a great time.  I picked J up from his bike ride home from school and we all went out to eat, then back to our house to visit some more.  They just left a few minutes ago - again with tears.  If I have a break this week, I'll drive down to Colorado Springs with R to see them at my brother's - where they stayed because there are no stairs and Mom can't climb them at this altitude.  And he has a nice, new, beautiful home with a really nice guest room!  If she doesn't start getting sick from the altitude, they'll be here the coming week.  Otherwise, they'll head out for Indiana, where they both were born and grew up, to see my Aunt J and Mom's closest cousin, whom everyone calls Cousin B.  That's almost sea level again, and she won't have any problems there.  It breaks my heart that I'm working right now, because if I weren't, R and I could go up to Greeley with them to see my oldest sister later this week and also down to the Springs to visit them at my brother's.  Anyway, if they are still here by Friday, we'll go to the Denver Zoo.  If not, K will still come up and go to the zoo with us as it's had a lot of renovations made on it that are done now and we're excited to see it.  Plus, 2 new gorilla babies, and the tiger cubs should still be with their mom.  I'm excited about it.  Just hope my parents are still here.  It's hard to live so far from them.  They are in such bad health - my dad has a pacemaker and very bad arthritis.  My mom has congestive heart failure, had a mild stroke about 2 years ago, has diabetes, osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid arthritis and a serious back problem that causes her to walk with a cane most of the time.  They are in their late 70's.  R loves to see them and be around them and it scares me that we probably won't have them around all that much longer.  It's not as if they are young and healthy.  I guess I worry most about Mom, too.  Anyway, it turned out to be a lovely day and R had a great time with everyone.  J is helping her with her bathe and then she's off to bed.  I've got some laundry yet, to iron church clothes for tomorrow, and to prepare my lesson.  Whew!  So, I'm off here for tonight.

      Man, it's been a while and I can't say I'm really wanting to type, but I think I could use the therapy, you know?  My title?  I read a book years ago called "Tell Me How Long The Train's Been Gone".  Can't remember the details about it now, it's been so long, but it was about a mixed race affair in southern U.S. between an actress and actor in the days when that just wasn't done (not that it's okay in the south these days, either, but at one time people - usually black men - were hung by vigilantes over such things down there).  Anyway, I always loved the title.  Probably takes me back to my youth when I used to say I wished I could just hop a train and start all over somewhere..... Don't really know what that says about my teen years.  Or I do and I'm not telling - lol.   Rough, rough week for me.  Got started working regularly and it's been 8, 10, 12 hour days every day.  I feel inadequate, but my boss keeps telling me I'm doing great.  And we need the money.  But, oh my gosh my house looks like hell!  And poor R.....I'm keeping her busy with school work I give her most days and she has to read 1 hour daily, too.  Then she has swim team and I drag her to the library for the reading program (in fact, we went today since I finished up early and she had a great time playing on the computer for about 10 minutes and then in the "treehouse" with some other kids while I looked for books for her).  I'm getting several chapter books every time, mainly 3rd grade level, and she's reading them fine!  I'm so proud of her.  And I'm trying to do at least one play date a week.  But, I've been a queen B----.  Not meaning to be.  Had, what I thought was a really, really bad episode of PMS.  But my TOM was about 12 - 15 days late (guessing since I didn't write it down in my daytimer like I usually do).  Finally started, and then on Monday night, while sitting on R's bed singing to her, I coughed and......well, without detailing the gory part, I had another miscarriage.  I thought I might be, but then thought it was just this on-coming menopause.  And I'm under so much stress and so tired.  So, I just thought I was late because of all that.  But I'd had really, really bad cramping starting Sunday evening and all day on Monday.  That's very unusual for me.  Well, needless to say, R was freaking out even though I explained I just had a female problem.  We've talked slightly about periods before, so I was able to just tell her that it was a strange one and I'd be taking a shower and I'd check on her after.  She calmed down and was asleep when I got out of the shower.  But, J was at work and had forgotten his cell phone and initially I was so upset when I realized what was going on.  If you've ever had a miscarriage, it's really rather awful, worse the further along you are.  "Everything" just sort of....falls out.  Anyway, my mood was sad and dark for a few days until I allowed myself to have a good, hard cry.  I think I didn't allow it at first because I thought, "Geez, I didn't even know for sure."  It's not like we are trying, we just don't do anything to prevent it.  And why should we?  It's so unlikely and rare and one day soon it won't be possible anymore.  But, it has made things very hard this past week.  Okay, that behind me, J is doing well in school, although in a bit of a mood tonight.  I got home from the library and some errrands, having forgotten my cell phone which was charging, and there were 5 hang up messages from him on our home phone!  They were all within a few minutes of each other.  I called him and he was sitting in his car outside school, moody and mopping.  Had to cheer him up enough to get him to go to school and then finish taking care of what I needed to - putting things away, small things around the pit (my house) and getting R ready for bed in a few hours.  Hopefully, he's just adjusting to my working and this will pass.  But it always worries me that it won't, you know?  Just because of all those years when his mood got dark and he didn't pull himself up for week or even months.  I have to have faith that he's better and he'll figure out a way to cope on his own without my having to feed his ego, mood and whatever else all the time.  I'm so darn busy as it is.......And a bit of a wwwwwhhhhhiiiinnnnneeeerrrrr - LOL.   Got this from Heather, and Bell did it in her blog, too:  01. What time do you get up?  Usually about 6:00 when we are on Daylight Savings Time, or as I like to call it, Daylight Waste My Time.  I sleep in when I can, but I can't remember when that's been past 7 or 8 a.m. and that's rare.  02. If you could eat lunch with one person, who would it be?  Well, it would be my e-mail group of friends, in a great location for all of us, all expenses paid for a week long gathering.....Oh, yeah.  We're just talking lunch.  lol.   Otherwise, I think it would be the prophet of my church.  03. Gold or silver?   Gold, Baby!!!!    04. What was the last film you saw at the cinema?   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I loved the new director, too, Heather.  Loved it!  You miss far too much without reading the books, though.  05. Favorite TV show(s)?   I'm a medical show junkie!  ER, Third Watch, Scrubs (for the laughs)are my favs.   06. What did you have for breakfast?  Well, this morning I had Raisin Bran cereal with skim milk.  Usually, though, I have egg substitute almost every morning with some low fat cheese in it and then I vary it with a tortilla, English muffin, bacon or something.    07. Who would you hate to be stuck in a room with?   Ah, Heather, I love ya, Girl, but our politics are polar opposites.  Good thing we don't talk about it - or if we do, the other doesn't say anything back - LOL.  Hmmmmmm, who can I really not stand????  I know, a sex offender (I'd kill him, though).  I really can't think of an individual, though.   08. What is your middle name?  Lynn.  09. Beach, City or Country?   I like living in the suburbs but wish this city was smaller - sort of like it was when I first moved to this area over 25 years ago.  Ewwww, I'm old...... lol   10. Favorite Ice cream?  Rocky Road!  Don't tell my H & H pals, but I had some tonight.....blush.  11. Butter, plain or salted popcorn?  I LOVE popcorn, but I don't like it terribly buttery.  I get the lighter buttered version.  However, and they don't make it any more, so it's not on my list as #1, I loved the Corn on the Cob Popcorn that ACT II used to make - yummy!!!!   12. What kind of car do you drive?  Dodge Caravan eC - that's the cheap one.  lol.  My dream car when I was single was a jag.  After I got married, it became a mini van.  Hm.  Got my dream, I guess......Now if only it was paid for.....  14. What characteristic do you despise?  Lying - which leads to many other negative paths.    15. Favorite flower?  Orchids, by far.  Delicate and beautiful.  Iris next.  But I like a rose and lilacs (they smell soooo wonderful).  My list could go on.....   16. If you could go anywhere in the world on vacation, where would you go?   Europe would be in there - Ireland, Scotland, Italy, Germany, Greece and then a quick drop to Australia and New Zealand.  Hope to make it so one day.   17. What color is your bathroom?  We have 3.  R's and our master baths are "Snow white" - and they are very, very white.  But the rooms look bigger that way.  I'd like our master to be the pale green our bedroom is, though.  Our powder room is a lilac, much more pink than I originally intended.  But, that's how paint is sometimes.  18. Favorite brand of clothing?  None. I don't pay attention to brands.   19. Where would you retire to?  Estes Park, Colorado.  It's where J and I were married (the 1st time) and we go there a lot because there is soooo much wildlife.  It's in the Rocky Mountains in Northern Colorado.  Beautiful, peaceful place that feels like 'home' to me because we went there all the while I was growing up, too.     20. Favorite day of the week?   Sunday! It's the one day I can rest once we get home from church.   21. What did you do for last birthday?  J grilled steak for me, bought a cake.  My baby girl made me a bunch of stuff (for Mother's Day, too, the little crafter!).  I got to relax in the evening, too.    22. Where were you born?   Landstuhl, Germany.  I am an alien, Heather.  Oh, different thing.... LOL    23. Favorite sport to watch?   Football!!!! Broncos!!!!!!!!   I like Hockey, too.  But football season, I catch all of the Broncos games!   26. What fabric detergent do you use?  Tide. I use it for the stain power, too.  And I use lye soap for stains that I ordered on-line.  Used to get it in my home town, but all the old ladies who made it have passed on.  I was out and finally found a place on-line to order it for $3.00 a bar!    27. Coke or Pepsi?  Diet Dr.Pepper!  28. Are you a morning person or a night owl?  I would say I am a morning person - that's when I have the most energy, enjoy the day, etc.  But sometimes I sit up later than a human should.  29. What is your shoe size?  Oh Geez!  They are a huge size 11 - wide most of the time!  Sometimes I can get into a 10  1/2.   30. Do you have any pets?   Yes, our sweet little Lacey the cat (also known as Catbert - you know, Dilbert?) whom we got about 5 days before 9/11 happened and she was 6 months old then.  She's sort of my cat.  Daisy is our dog (aka Dogbert), definately J's dog.  She's a good watch dog, although a big, lazing black blob on the couch right now....lol.    I'm going to bed........

      When I first start it, it's all I can do to push myself to do it every day.  But after just 5 days of it, it seems to be getting easier.  I even managed to do Tae Bo this morning.  I didn't think I could manage to get my butt through it, but I did.  Just not at my peak performance.  I feel very good about that, though.  Now I just need to work harder at getting my eating under better control so I can see some significant weight loss.  It's time.  Time to focus more on what I need to do to be healthy and then I can do whatever else needs doing.  Shoot!  I just got up to check on the towels I dried last night and the dryer won't turn on.  J called just after I realized there was a problem and said it may have just overheated.  He'll check it when he gets home since it's buzzing when I try to turn it on.  Oh yeah, that's all we need.  Down to one car and now the dryer.  Truth is, all our kitchen appliances are on their last legs.  I tell you, we just can't pull it together these days.  I'm just praying nothing else goes wrong.  Waiting for my dication tapes to be delivered.  Apparently, I won't be getting them for a while today.  Dang it.  If I get much, I'll be at it all night.  But, I just have to keep plugging along.  Enough whining.  Life will get better.  I'm just feeling a bit overwhelmed right now.  On the bright side, I am feeling stronger from my exercise and I will enjoy seeing the Royal Gorge this weekend.  I've been a number of time in my life, but the last time was in my 20's.  And I haven't taken a train ride since I was a Girl Scout in about 4th grade!  So that will be fun, too.  Rachel has wanted to ride a real train for a long time, too.  Now, she is old enough that she'll likely remember it.   Okay, I'm off to run to the post office and then to the bank.  Hopefully, when I get back, my work will be here.

      Didn't get any work today, so I'm going to take some time to blog.  Not feeling great today with a bit of a little stomach bug, I guess.  But not a bad one.    I have a hundred thoughts running through my head and feel like I hardly have time to focus on one before another bumps it away.  These are the time when I should find a moment to meditate, pray, bring some calmness over me somehow.  I've worked out 4 times in 6 days so far and plan to keep pushing that point.  I'm eating healthy all day, but not in the evening.  The exercise helps with the tumbling thoughts and if I could make a whole day of healthy eating, it would help that much more.  Now, where to begin?  Let me try to pull my thoughts together and I can let them out here.  After all, that's what my blog is all about.   First, J has been struggling greatly with his depression.  I posted earlier that he dropped his visits to his therapist to monthly (too soon, I think, but as he angrily reminds me, I'm not a shrink and I can't play one, either - Ppppptththththtth to him since R and I have to live with him).  Anyway, aside from his first quarter in school, he has fallen behind every quarter and about halfway through, has to go like crazy trying to catch up and being constantly worried that he won't pass.  Of course, this turns into depression:  complaints about how unfair his life is, how hard he works compared to other people, how he has no life, etc.  Then he becomes sensitive to everything - even a "Honey, did you get such and such done today?"  He berates himself and then struggles to fight those thoughts.  Ultimately, I am somehow blamed for everything that is going on.  The truth is not that he gets behind because there is too much school work - although, no doubt there is a lot.  The truth is that he procrastinates at the beginning of the quarter and then runs in a panic for 6 weeks or so trying to miraculously do what he didn't do or only did some of for the first 6 weeks -  plus all the work that keeps coming as the quarter progresses.   And it's frustrating because he denies this and just blames everyone else for his circumstances - the school gives too much work, he has too much to do other than school work, he's the only one who works and goes to school, ect.  None of these are really the problem, but he must find someone else to blame rather than accept responsibility for his behavior.  This is a recurrent theme, as anyone who knows a depressive well has seen.  And it sucks for the people around them being blamed, unfortunately.  Despite all this, we had a long, difficult talk on Saturday (and again on Monday) and he is doing better.  He took R and her best friend, S, swimming on Saturday and S's dad came along with her younger brother, too.  So J had an opportunity to talk to someone besides me and got some exercise.  Oh, and R beat him in the breast stroke!!  It's his most difficult stroke, but still, R did awesome!  He was so proud of her.  Anyway, he sees his therapist on Thursday which I'm sure will help.   Okay, next thing is we have this trip this weekend.  It's the only 'vacation' we could manage for several reasons.  First, money is tight.  Second, J couldn't get time off from school and work at the same time and have it match any time R is out of school, too.  So, he managed to get a couple of days this weekend and is making up Sat. morning's class by taking it Friday night.  Now, I always look forward to our trips and I am looking forward to this one.  But every vacation we have ever, ever taken, J has been angry, depressed, yelling, disappearing and leaving R and I alone someplace (not without transportation, mind you), etc.  It's always been something.  The last trip was when he did the week long bike ride - Bike Tour of Colorado - and asked us to meet him at a motel in.....shoot, I can't remember the mountain town we were in.  Anyway, I didn't want to do it because  I knew.  I knew  what we were in for.  And I really didn't want to go through it.  It was nice having him gone that week.  It was peaceful.  I had to take the dog with us, which wasn't terrible, but was more difficult than not taking her.  I had a lot of stuff going on at the time, too, with obligations I had.  But, I did it because he wanted me to and promised it would be a nice, relaxing time for us.  But it wasn't.  He was a bear who yelled at all three of us the whole time we were there.  I was never so glad to let him out of the car as I was the day we dropped him off at the starting point and R, Daisy and I headed home.  And I think that's terribly sad.  Even R said she never wanted to do that again.  And I promised her we wouldn't.  The trip before that, we'd had the same type of thing a least half the time.  When my parents were here and we headed to Indiana to visit family, he disappeared on us after refusing to give me $20.00 so R could ride the carnival rides at the county fair my aunt was playing at.  It gave her unlimited rides and she was so excited.  My parents gave me some money to take her on a couple of rides.  Then he finally came back and I think he knew everyone was upset with him, so he gave us the money and I took R on the rides until it was time to go.  My folks said he sat and sulked that whole time - several hours.  So, in spite of being excited about the things we will be able to do and see, there is also the dread, the fear, the prayers that he can maintain and control himself so that R has a good time and gets to do all she wants.  And I try to think of how I can go the extra mile to make things nice for him.  What can I do different that will help him enjoy himself.  Already, he's talking about how it won't be fun for him because he'll have to take school work with him.  But that's not my doing and I can't help him there.  And it certainly has nothing to do with R.  She should be allowed to do whatever she wants.  But, I'm going with the idea that everything will be fine.  Because that's the best I can do.  I haven't had work in 2 days.  That's upsetting because you know my doctor is seeing patients every day and that means I will have tapes for 3 or 4 days worth of appointments.  When I called my boss, she said I'd get them tomorrow.  I'm not looking forward to it at all because I'll be swamped and I need to have everything done by the end of the day Friday (and not be up until 3 a.m working since we area planning to leave at 6 a.m.).  I told my boss we were going on this trip so she would know and that's how I came to know I'd get tapes tomorrow.  I expect at least 2, maybe 3.   Today was payday for me.  I feel like I've worked so much, but that check wasn't what I'd hoped it would be.  I'm hoping this month is better for me.  It's taken me all day, once again, to post and now it's getting late and I need to be up early so I can get my workout in.  Guess I'll post again the next chance I have.  Oh, and I can't believe how strong my desire to write has been.  You know I write short stories and have a historical western I've been working on for a long time.  I really have wanted to write some, so I'm hoping I have a chance on our trip or can start back with that on weekends.  Off to bed for me.  Yyyyaaaawwwnnnn.

      I will get back to posting on here. I really will. I need to for my mental health (as most blogger's know)! But I'm really exhausted, overworked, emotionally drained from J having struggles with his school and fighting his depression demon, getting R ready for school, wishing I was making more than I am and preparing to take a small, overnight 'vacation' this weekend since it's all we could work out. Poor R. Today she asked if when we got back from this trip, could we please go to the mountains for a week. She wants a trip somewhere. But now, maybe she and I will go see Grandma and Grandpa in Texas when fall break comes in October for a few days. Have to see how finances are. Off to bed. So tired I'm dizzy.

      Sunday I wrote a huge post, then watched it disappear as we had a temporary internet connection loss of seconds - just right at the moment I was trying to post it - GRRRRRRR.  Oh well.  I guess whatever I said wasn't important - lol.  Then I was too tired to try again and swamped with work yesterday, so I'll post a couple of the things I wanted to Sunday.  No tapes so far today, thankfully.  I was up until 5:30 a.m. trying to finish up the two tapes I got yesterday, late morning.  Up with R at about 8:30 this morning and I'm catching catnaps as I can now.   Whenever I talk about my church in this blog, I try to explain some of it so that anyone reading it might have a better idea of what my church believes and how things work in it.  Recently, two of the Apostles in our church have passed away.  We have a living prophet, sometimes referred to as the president of our church.  He has two counselors and then, just as when Christ set up the church on the earth, we have 12 apostles.  Most of these men are older because such a position requires a full time commitment and no one in our church gets paid for their callings.  Our Bishop - similar to a pastor - is not paid anything.  He works a full time job to support his family, as well as fulfilling his calling.  This is the way it is at every level in our church.  So, often times for the highest callings, those people are retired.  That's not a given, because we believe these people are called by divine revelation, but it usually is the case (afterall, the Lord knows what He's doing either way).  Anyway, in April, the prophet's wife passed away (she was in her 90's).  Then, about 12 days ago, Elder Neal Maxwell passed away after a long battle with leukemia.  He was about 76 or 78 (can't remember).  Saturday afternoon, Elder David Haight died at 97 due to age related issues.  Sad to lose two great men so close together like that.  Both of them had given talks at General Conference just this past April.  When I lost my post on Sunday, I'd mentioned the above.  And I mentioned that we sang a hymn I really love called Abide With Me, 'Tis Eventide.  I can't sing it because I can't get through it - I cry every time.  Sort of embarrassing, but in our church people often get choked up when they are speaking about spiritual things.  You can here the tune at this website (hopefully you can just click on it.  Otherwise, you'll have to paste it):   urlLink http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/a/b/abidewmt.htm   These are the words to the hymn:   Abide with me, ’tis eventide!The day is past and gone; The shadows of the evening fall;The night is coming on! Within my heart a welcome Guest,Within my home abide.  Refrain: O Savior, stay this night with me;Behold, ’tis eventide! O Savior, stay this night with me;Behold, ’tis eventide!  Abide with me, ’tis eventide!Thy walk today with me Has made my heart within me burn,As I communed with Thee. Thy earnest words have filled my soulAnd kept me near Thy side.  Refrain  Abide with me, ’tis eventide!And lone will be the night, If I cannot commune with Thee,Nor find in Thee my light. The darkness of the world, I fear,Would in my home abide.  Refrain  I think it is the words that touch my heart so much.  Even going to the website with the tune, though, and pasting it on here makes me almost weep.  I wish that when things were difficult - the stress was at its strongest, my worries were overwhelming me - I could feel what I feel when I *try* to sing this song or hear it.  My best friend's mother always played religious music.  I can remember L and I rolling our eyes about it and playing around like we couldn't wait to get out of the house.  But as I got older and began to reach that spiritual side of myself, I came to understand that in her harsh world, she played that music to lift up her heart.  It helped her.  At the same time, remembering my feeling that way keeps me from playing a lot of religious music in my home - which really seems sort of awful when I think about it.  It was after R was born before I even put up any pictures that were religious.  Now, I have a beautiful collection of pencil drawings in a frame of Christ with children:  a newborn babe laying against His shoulder at the center of the frame and then surrounded by other drawings - He is lifting a laughing baby up in the air as they both laugh, walking a toddler in front of Him as the baby looks up and they are smiling at each other, tickling a little boy in his lap while his brother leans over Christ's back, holding a little girl in his arm while he talks to her older sister - all smiling, hugging a girl of 9 or 10 as they both smile and then sitting with two young women, maybe 15, 16 or 17 years old.  It is exactly as I would imagine Him with children.  And I have a picture of Christ that my mom gave to me in our hallway heading upstairs.  I also have a print I love of the pioneers pushing handcarts across the prairie in the snow and you can see on their faces, they are at the end of their strength - with angels helping them push.   Hmmmm, how did I get off on all this?  On my mind a lot lately, I guess.  Going hand in hand with what I'd posted about needing to work on my spiritual side, I'm guessing.   Anyway, swim team has ended.  No one told us, though.  We found out when we drove up to the pool and a lifeguard was leaving.  I was a bit irritated because the last I'd heard was they were planning a party for a Monday instead of the original Sunday after the last swim meet.  R, of course, was counting on swimming so she was crying.  But, we got our own little cake and put Congratulations on it for her and she and her best friend are going swimming Sat., plus she'll be at a swim party next Friday, too.  She was pretty happy in the end and I was grateful that I didn't end up missing an entire night of sleep because after working til 5:30 a.m. I would have had to stay up to take R to lessons this morning - lol.  How pleasant I'm sure I would have been today.  lol.  My parents got home from visiting Indiana and family there and my mom called to tell me about it.  My 2nd cousin had been sick and then to a point she couldn't (or really just didn't want to) eat.  So after 3 times of her being hospitalized - one while my folks were there and the Dr.'s never figuring out what was going on - my Aunt took matters into her own hands!  She cooked several meals, took them over and made B eat - a little at a time - told her husband, who has had a lot of health problems the last two years but hadn't been being very nice to her lately, to back off!, and checked up on her every day.  She told her to just take small bites of food all day long.   By the time my parents were leaving, about 4 days after my Aunt started doing this for her, B was eating well again and feeling much better.  I told my mom that we women don't get much TLC unless another woman reaches out to us and since B is a caregiver, too, with her husband's health issues, she was probably just empty.  My Aunt gave her the TLC and time she needed and it made her well.  Sometimes, that's what we need.  That's what good friends give us - even if they aren't close by.  Sometimes, we finally break through the negatives and give it to ourselves.  However we come by it, we all needed it now and then to stay afloat and keep going.   So, for all my friends who stick with me, give me support, advise, shake a finger at me now and then, tell me to be nice to me - Thank You.

      Well, after going on about all the things I'm worried about, feel inadequate about, know I'm not doing, I thought I should pay the other side it's fair share.  That's something I don't usually do.  But two good friends commented about that post and one of them even wrote more extensively about seeking out the positives and loving yourself for who you are in her own blog.  So, how could I not at least try?  So, here we go:  1.  I know that I am a good mom most of the time.  I know that in being a good mom, I at least do as well as the majority of good mothers and probably even sometimes surpass some of them.  My daughter loves me and wants to spend time with me, which also should indicate to me that she enjoys our time together, too.  I do make sure I spend time with her every single day - either in play or reading together, doing a craft together, something.  I do wish I had more time to do things with her, so I am planning on taking her to the zoo and the museum before school starts (hopefully, J will cooperate and leave the car for me on two Saturdays).  2.  I am capable of eating healthy, cooking healthy meals, not eating any sugar or white flour or any junk.  I know this because I have done so previously - several years ago when I succeeded in losing 62 pounds.  I know this is something that will make me feel better emotionally, as well as physically.  I know I really MUST do this for my health.  I also know I can be a great influence on R by being a good example and keeping the junk out of the house.  It is my goal to begin this change, this new lifestyle, Monday morning with a workout of some sort and a planned healthy menu.   3.  If I take the time each evening and each morning to calm myself and prepare for the end of, or beginning of, each day, I will have time for prayer, meditation, putting my stresses behind me for the day.  This will help me work on my spiritual feelings at the same time it helps me gain control of my eating.  This is the way I stopped smoking years ago, so I must employ this menthod to help me succeed in losing weight.  I will set smaller goals for the weight loss instead of looking at the end result alone.  My first goal will be to reach 250.  Then I can set it for 230, then 200, then 180 and decide at that point how much more I want to lose.  This is workable, managable and doesn't seem overwhelming.  4.  I am improving at my job and by the time R heads to school in three weeks, I should be doing well (and I'd better.  My boss said I'll be swamped when R goes back to school - lol).  This will and has allowed me to bring much needed income into our family, kept up and feed my interest in the medical field and been rewarding.   5.  I can't drag J alone with me.  He must be responsible for his own desicions and it is not my job to try to get him to do what is right or what is most helpful.  I can be an example, I can ask him how he is doing and provide support, but my ability to do anything more ends there.  It is time I worry about me and what I am doing for myself and my family without worrying about any other adult.  By doing anything else, I am not following part of the creed of George Albert Smith which I admire and have hung up to read frequently which states: "I would not seek to force people to live up to my ideas, but rather love them into doing the thing that is right."   6.  I will have more faith in my Heavenly Father to provide for our family what we need to survive.  It is not about having much, but only about having enough.  And we do have enough.  As Christ told the disciples as he concluded the Sermon on the Mount: "And why take ye thought for raiment?  Consider the lillies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?  Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?  or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.  Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."  Such a reassurance.  And funny how easy it is not to have faith in such things.  So, I will try harder to have such faith.  Everything has worked out for J to continue his schooling, in spite of all the odds against him on that with his job.  We have a descent house over our heads, we have one reliable car that we really love, we have pets that help bring joy into our household, we have a magnificent daughter who brings the greatest joy and love into our house, we have good friends, both nearby and afar, we have our church for support and our extended family.  And one of the biggest issues that we must be grateful for is that J recognized his illness and got the help he needed, takes his medication daily and sees a therapist for added support.  He has greatly changed in many positive ways.   7.  I am grateful for the simple pleasures and gifts in life - sight, hearing, speach, freedom in this country, the ability to walk, sing, travel freely, etc.  I have my dream which has always been to be a wife and mother.  I am able to enjoy my past times now and then, which is to write stories, read about and study the Old West, sing, read.   I could keep adding to this list because the truth is that there are many ways to see the positives in life.  Seeing the positive just makes things better and even more positive.  One good thing breeds another.  I need to focus on these good things and not allow the negative thoughts to cloud my thinking and bring me down.  I will seek affirmation in every direction and try hard to find the strength, the power, that I need to do the things that matter to me most.
