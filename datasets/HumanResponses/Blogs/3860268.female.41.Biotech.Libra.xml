      I posted on Craig's list yesterday that I am looking for a summer fling partner. Basically. Those weren't the words, but that was the message. I tried to be honest and let men know that I am not precisely "HWP", though I'm pretty close these days. Since I didn't post under "casual encounters", I only received 5 responses (so far). Two men seemed to think that my request that they be "close to HWP" themselves meant that so long as they were within 100 pounds of "normal" they were acceptable. If I were that heavy, proportionately speaking, they'd be running the other way. Amazing what men think is acceptable in their own physiques, but totally unacceptable in women. Another man is someone who has responded in the past and whom I've actually met and had sex with. If I wanted a man with a severe ED problem, I would have stayed married. Not to mention the fact that the guy was dumb as a fence post. He did have a great body, though. And he had a thing for women with large butts. Even when I'm at my skinniest, I have what one man once called an "amazing ass". Which was in fact a compliment and referred to the fact that it's round and well defined...not a slender, muscular, extension-of-the-thigh type (which, frankly, if I were a male, I'd prefer). Another simply said he was looking for a "taller gal" for a summer romance and wanted to know if that would be me. Well, he didn't tell me how tall he was, so how would I know? Since I'm only 5' 4", I suspect I'm not the one for him, unless he is a dwarf. Which would be strange and maybe worth trying just for the stories. Finally, I have a photo of a very attractive, slender man in my inbox. It's a black and white professional photo. Makes me wonder when and why he had it taken.

      I had my cousin over for the weekend. I never knew her when she was a child...we lived in different states, widely spaced, and never attended family reunions. I "met" her about 9 years ago when I contacted her mother in search of genealogical information. Her mother was so excited about my contacting the family that she told everyone, and my cousin contacted me by email. Those were the early days of email, when I was excited about every piece of mail I received, especially if it had some personal significance. These days, my cousin's email would have been dumped directly into the spam bucket, unless I rescued it. But back then it hit my inbox --  and I was fascinated. My cousin knew the whole family history. Or proclaimed to know, anyway. And the family history was bizarre and fascinating. It was also the picture of dysfunction, but that did not at first concern me. Over the years, my cousin and I have gotten to know each other pretty well. She has introduced me to numerous family members and worked hard to make me feel welcome and comfortable.  She's visited me and I have visited her. We've tried hard to establish a rapport, with a lot of success, but also with a lot of regret -- on my part.  The thing is, my cousin drives me insane. She never, ever, stops talking. Okay, sometimes she's not talking, but at those moments she is humming. Usually some religious hymm. And her conversation centers around her body. The lunch gave her a stomach ache, the wine precipitated a headache, the cat aggravated her asthma, the plants her allergies. It never ends. And if it isn't her body, it's her kids. Child number 1 is the lead in the school play, while child number 2 has no date for the prom, but my cousin has found the perfect girl to fill that void. Child number 1 has become enamored of a particular drug, but is still getting good grades. Child number 2 is about to move out. The chatter goes on and on and on.   I had my cousin here from Friday until Monday afternoon, and I was daydreaming about weapons of individual destruction within hours of her arrival. Homicide or suicide? That was the question.
