      Seems I have to attempt something a few times for me to get it right - reminds me of something else but my memory is bad!!  I posted on here a few days ago and it is not showing up for some reason, at least not at my end.   I'm doing something wrong obviously.  I love computers, they have opened up a whole new world for me but they can be so infuriating at the same time.  I know it's me and if I sit here long enough I'll figure it all out.  OK lets give this a go and if it works I'll write something a little more interesting next time................to be continued.....I hope!

      I'm new at this but it takes me back to my teens when I was all full of angst and everything I thought was expressed in one of those 5 year lock-up diarys, remember them?  So now I can talk to the whole world if I so wish.  What a good idea this would be for my Mum, she is house-bound and what she finds to do with her day I don't know.  If I ever won just a small amount on the lottery I'd buy her a computer and teach her the limited amount I know on how to use one, treat her to some lessons also.  It would open up her World.  I'll buy a ticket this very day.

      On my way home last night, after my 900th taxi-run (for the kids) of the day, I did my usual and bought a Chinese take-away.  That's food, not a man!!  I looked forward to getting home, finally sitting down for 10 minutes and satisfying all my current needs (I'm still talking food here.)  A couple bites of the chicken part of my meal and it hit me just how tasteless chicken is these days compared to how it used to be when I was a kid myself.  I was quickly into a familiar fowl-phobic routine, examining all the pieces closely, cutting them all into tiny bits.  They look perfectly alright, it's probably just the water that producers inject into the birds these days to increase profit.  Or is it?  For God's sake I'm forever doing this with chicken - the effects of too many horror stories about unwitting supermarkets and catering establishments being supplied with dodgy meat.  There is nothing to justify my fears but, by now, I've got the idea firmly in my head and it won't go away. When did I last have an experience with chicken?  Never!  I've been laid low by liver, I've thrown up on prawns, but the humble hen has never harmed my health.  However, that doesn't stop me treating it like a culinary landmine everytime it appears on my plate.  The sequence goes something like this: eat some; worry about it; poke it around; decide to leave it; figure that as I've already eaten some the damage is done; eat the rest; worry some more.  Tonight I shall have beef! Hah!  Therein lies another story.....if I got CJD/BSE aka Mad Cow, would anyone know the difference  :)

      I must admit to been just a tad thrilled when I drive around these days and see the flag of St.George flying from cars, houses, trees, almost anything that will take a flag.  I wish it was because of a sudden wave of patriotism but alas it is mainly due to a certain football tournament taking place in Portugal.  This happened at the last World Cup too and I do think it makes such a difference, jollies the whole place up.  It has been so un-PC in recent years to show any sign of love for your country if you happen to be English, I don't who dictates the fashion of the day but I would guess the buck stops at the particular door of the Government of the time.  Whenever I am in the United States for example, I am most impressed at seeing the Stars and Stripes flying from almost every building, including residences.  When their Nation Anthem is played and the citizens place their hand over their heart, that always moves me.  I wish we could more like that, I know we're not helped by our National Anthem being such a dirge, perhaps there should be a campaign to get Land of Hope and Glory promoted or Jerusalem, which despite it's title is very much a song associated with England.  I feel there is a slight shift in thinking and I know views are being expressed over here that we should make more of St.George's Day than we do for example.  I'm all for that and will try to do my bit and not just when there is a football tournament on.  I will admit to getting a lump in my throat every time I see the Union Jack raised and the National Anthem played whenever we win an Olympic Gold medal for instance - ahh fond memories of that happening 12 times in 2000!!!..could this year bring as many lumps I wonder?  I'm so proud of my country and I love being English and I don't care if it is un-PC to say so.  I hope we will all follow the example of our friends in the US and FLY THE FLAG, TALK THE TALK and WALK THE WALK..........speaking of which, no I'll save that for my next blog entry!!

      It isn't here yet - 50 that is!  My brother hit 50 last year and was to run the London Marathon to celebrate(!)  He got injured just before so he ran it this year instead.  I'm not so foolhardy, I would struggle to walk the London Marathon, I've volunteered to be his sponge-person when he runs the New York marathon in 2005.  Anyway, it got me thinking what I could do when I hit 50, it's 33 months away yet but what I want to do takes a bit of planning so I'm getting cracking on it now.  I have always wanted to walk the length of Britain, I think I'll go from John O'Groats in Scotland to Lands End in Cornwall, downhill that way!!  Not sure if I will raise money for charity while I'm making the attempt but probably will, most people do and I don't want to seem a meanie.  Mainly I'm doing for myself because, in the words of the mountaineer Chris Bonnington, it's there!  Early doors yet but that's Plan A, I'd love company too so if there is anyone out there who also fancies doing such a crazy thing, well join the club.  The countdown starts here!

      It's not that I'm counting or anything but one week from now the school holidays in the UK commence!  Those that know me will already know this, so permission granted to skip this paragraph.  For those who in some moment of insanity have accidently strayed onto this blog let me tell you I have two school-age children, I also have a husband which by defination in The Gospel According to Puddled Duck means three children, one of which is past school-age.  Anyway, come next Wednesday I have to spend 7 weeks trying to keep them entertained, or at least occupied.  If they both have something to do or look at then more peace for me because they otherwise spend their time bickering with one another and my blood pressure level starts soaring towards Mars!  My oldest child is now old enough to consider days out with his Mum completely naff but then if I don't at least invite him along I get accused of favouritism, if I do invite him and he refuses I'm in the clear but have to suffer a constant barrage of "I'm bored, what can I do?" until I leave the house.  Then the guilt factor kicks in because he is stuck in the house on his own with nothing to do.  I did get a positive reaction when I mentioned a trip to Blackpool and a visit to their huge Pleasure Beach complex, so that is one day sorted and a complete set of satisfied customers, only 48 other days to go...any suggestions?  Answers on a postcard please!!
