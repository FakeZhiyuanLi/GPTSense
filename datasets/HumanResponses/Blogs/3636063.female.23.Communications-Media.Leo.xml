      just realised i haven't jotted anything down for my new articles...yet! i've been using all my nonprofessional writing energy for this blog...hehehehehehe!  i hope Airil still  "love to read"  my writings, which is cool. but, part of me wishes he didn't!  ( yeah dude, i know you're busy like mad! so, tak baik kacau you kan?)  i feel guilty for feeling that way sebenarnya, but it's just so scared to think that he might not interested nak baca my articles lagi *(imagination...silly!)* ahhh, don't have to worry about that at the moment la!  am so excited on the next time i'll see my best-psycho-buddy -- next month! yippeee! he was supposed to come here for the International Literature convention thingy...but ahhh don't care, don't care. don't care,i'll make sure Airil will be available to lepak wimme and Shasha, this time including breakfast, lunch and dinner at Hartamas Square ya doink?

      we all make mistakes. chances are, i've done something i'm not proud of! (yeah, i know you hate me so much now Juan!) do i want to be judged by Diba's friends for all of my bad-crazy-notty stuff in my 'past'? (errmm...like few days ago la..) i didnt think so...  i'm much mellow now so anyone's friend can now stop hating and bitching about me ok? but if you muunnkeys ada tak puas hati dgn i, please tell me, email me alright? don't act like a chicken and hiding behind an Anonymous name ok?  oh well, i just realized that i should not risk my own happiness and emotional well-being on someone's bf who has caused me so much pain in my life! no Juan, i'll never be angry at you because you are such an incredible friend i ever had...like i said Juan, back when i was down and out i thought nobody cared about me. and that’s when i found you in friendster and we became friends...you totally changed my life and because of you i’ll be alright, i’m so thankful for you, dear Juan!  ahhh yes to you muuunnnkeyss: i want you babes to know that i'm not by any chance trying to steal Juan (maybe God's forbid...) and trying to ruin their relationship!!!  of course  ,Diba is the only girl who has ever mattered to Juan. so muuunkeyss stop acting like a   chicken  and bitch-out about me anymore!  ohhh ya, i'm sorry. my mouth was working ahead of my brain few days ago...like i said, people make mistakes right?

      no one compared-to you!  Listen... Back when I was down and out I thought nobody cared about me. And that’s when I found you yeah. You came along and changed my life and cause of you I’ll be alright I’m so thankful for you!  (friends came friends went, that’s when it came evident) I can put my trust in you (people places, things change in my world one thing remains) that noone compares you...  I’ve had friends, lovers come and go. One thing I know no one can compare to you. And that is why I’ll be by your side. In this thing for life. Cause no one can compare to you..  You say what you mean. Mean what you say. Always keep it real that way, that’s why I respect you. You always taking care of me. Never ask for anything and I thank God He gave me you..  Everything I’ve been through baby. Said I’m never alone, cause you’ve always been there through the hardest times I’ve known and I only hope that I can be everything you are to me baby, I wanna spend my life with you....

        even when i'm sleeping-  don't be confused by my apparent lack of ceremony, my mind is clear. i may be low or miles high off in the distance, i want you near. i love you even when i'm sleeping. when I close my eyes you're everywhere. and if they take me flying on the magic carpet, see me wave...  if our communication fails i'll reconnect it, i want to rave! i love you even when i'm sleeping. when i close my eyes you're everywhere. no matter where the road is leading us remember, don't be afraid. we have a continent that sometimes comes between us,but that's ok...i love you even when i'm sleeping, when i close my eyes you're everywhere. when i close my eyes, you're everywhere. oh, don't be afraid, don't be afraid...  --  when you think about L+O+V+E, no story epitomises it more clearly than Romeo and Juliet...*sigh* BUT what happen when IT become reality? Oh golly...help me!

Though, I still believe you have a ‘writer’ in you...somewhere, you’ll see"     and he said...again:  "never give up Faraa-d, NEVER...C’est la vie mon ami!"  c'est la vie mon ami? eh?   who is 'he' by the way? he: my beloved buddy: airil haimi! ('THE' high priest of COOL dudes colony! *winks*)    dear AIRIL HAIMI,   you're my angel in disguise. you read my soul with your eyes. your spirit has entered my heart. and it's my hope we never part. for you are so special to me. without you, my heart would weep bitterly. you're my angel in disguise. your love and friendship comforts my cries. and it is for that, my dear angel, i owe you my life!       *faraa-d*  hey babe (dude)!! bila nak turun KL ni? miss ya ok?

       BURN IN HELL YOU SON OF A BITCH! I'll give you one thing: you've got balls - big ones. They may be someone else's balls, (you borrowed to impress you girlfriend or wife or flings..oh who knows?) bouncing off your chin, but you've still got them!      Have you guys read his comment? (7th Aug)     Every word he writes is a lie, including "and" and "the." So this is why you're supposed to judge people on personality!  He is scared of his own shadow! *tbbrrrrr! coward! You're not even worthy of being called chicken-shit, you sloppy piece of newly hatched chicklet diarrhea! T  he only thing worse than a liar is a liar that's also a hypocrite! You are such a hypocrite! You are quite a good liar; it's a pity you have no other redeeming quality, moron! I believe you, but thousands wouldn't...too bad! Don't tell fish stories where the people know you; but particularly, don't tell them where they know the fish la...ehhehehehe!        *winks*winks* How clever you are, my dear! You never mean a single word you say.        now, you can say whatever you wants! The truth is..what matters? *winks* People, you take the lies out of him, and he'll shrink to the size of your hat; you take the malice out of him, and he'll disappear! Agree with me? Hahahahahhaa!  Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?  p/s: It's lucky for you that you have a hole in the end of your dick. Otherwise, oxygen couldn't get to your brain!

         to:   foul spoken coward, that thund'rest with thy tongue, and with thy weapon nothing dares perform!       i've received these very funny comments from this person called IDIOT.  ( i know you have to be somebody, but why do you have to be you kan? bodoh betul lah engkau ni! now, do me favour. please change your name to i.d.i.o.t; that way, so that if i lose you, everyone will know it's you i'm shouting for!)        i know he/she load my blog sebab dia memang suka giler to read my blog, and just wanna know about my latest news kan? hahahah but, if you wanna read my blog...JUST read it la ok? tak payah la menggatalkan yourself...coz he/she was trying to write something baaaaaddd about me here.           hey loser; you know what? don't be stupid ok? a wiseman once said:   genius does what it must, talent does what it can, but you? you had best do what you're told!(coz you are a loser!)            tak per,whatever it is, i am so impressed by your God-given gift for unparalleled ineptitude! yeah, you know that i'm talking about you here....don't be such an ass! *tbbrrrrr! coward!*           kesian betul kat this person! tak habis-habis nak sakitkan hati sendiri! you know people, this coward, excels in picking on the most clueless of people in a vain attempt: to masque his own shortcomings. but unfortunately...it doesn't work! (pity you la moron!)          i used to think that you were a insufferable bore, but now i have a much lower opinion of you coz this particular idiot kan reminds me very much of a gyroscope, always spinning around at a frantic pace, but not really going anywhere!       OH GOLLY! i really couldn't care less lah!. i would have stepped on YOU biar jadi macam roti canai, if you weren't a piece of shit!           i don't know what your problem is, but i'll bet its hard to pronounce...(don't act like a monkey,if you tak puas hati or whatsoever, tell me la straight to my face?           what? u scared of me? ohhh...sorry....what? yes, yes, i agree with you dear darling, you are low quality, and lots of it...      hmmmm....thank god i tak rasa macam nak belasah orang, *winks* if not i would love to beat you up dah! BUT you know right, that i have a problem with cruelty to animals? *ouccchhh*           hey! seriously, citer la...what's your problems? WHAT? WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM YOU DAMN MORON!      you better get out of the way or i shall tread on you!         in your comment? you were telling? didn't get your wish dear. that wish you tulis for me or  for your mother ? you nak tahu apa pulak my wish for some bloody moron like you?   i hope some day you will find yourself and wish you were lost again!                  apa hal with you ni? we boleh tak, you  stop writing any stupid-dumb-of-yourself-comments in my blog again? have you ever been arrested for indecent exposure for being such an  asshole?            do you get a clearer idea of how   pathetic   at this you are, you ni kan, human equivalent of a bidet ok? (Oh btw,kalau tak tahu, BIDET is a fixture similar in design to a toilet  that is straddled for bathing the genitals and the posterior parts  =  YOU !   any similarity between you and a human is purely coincidental, actually!)  *ouuuuchhhhh*       ok lah, malas dah nak layan tulis this one panjang-panjang coz that moron won't understand punya! i better sign-off now. enjoy reading, loser! remember,  never let your sense of morals get in the way of doing what's right! well, wisdom eventually comes to all of us. someday, it might even be your turn.... *winks*       you used no wit, intelligence, or bravado at all in your posts because you have no wit, intelligence or bravado at all!  any other idiotic comments , you out rightly beaten and battered babbling boob ok?           by the way loser, i understand what you are trying to say! (even though you obviously don't....yang engkau nak dengki with me ni apahal?) so, see you around! *hope not*   i swear i'll kick your ass if i see you!        You should treat me with a little more respect, someday, it’s going be my tax money paying for your prison cell!   *smile*smile*smile* ouch*ouch*ouch*          one trillion love for you,      -fd-        p/s: oh, don't thank me for insulting you. it was my pleasure.    i'd insult you with wit but it'd be wasted on you sebenarnya ni. so instead, go poke yourself in the eye with a fork after this okay? HAVE FUN!   (being a moron)
