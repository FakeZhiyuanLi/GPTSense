       Y&ouml;ung T&ouml;rless:  Y&ouml;ung T&ouml;rless (with cock-rock inspired umlauts over BOTH O's) was born in Vienna, Austria in 1906 but ironically raised in King Of Prussia, Pennsylvania.  T&ouml;rless spent the long greuling days of his youth slaving at the first Auntie Anne's Pretzel Stand in the then newly-constructed King of Prussia Mall, where he gave a new definition to the term 'pretzel dog'.  Our budding anti-hero occupied his long lonely nights masturbating to the then newly-printed J.C. Penny's catalog, a boyhood habit that has followed him to this day.  D.J. I Have No Friends:   D.J. I Have No Friends, n&eacute;e Chaim Jewerstien, is an experimental D.J., currently doing his residency at the prestigious Kyoto club  "Konichiwa" .  Eschewing tradition D.J. tools such as vinyl and turn-tables, D.J. I Have No Friends plies his trade in fecal material, first gaining prominence with his now infamous  "Donkey Shit vs. Human Wasabi Shit"  mashup that had London's underground arts scene projectile vomiting for days.  D.J. I Have No Friends hopes to one day work with pop (poop?) ing&eacute;nue Mandy Moore, who he describes as "[his] muse".  Ms. Moore, when asked for comment, described D.J. I Have No Friends as "[her] stalker and worst nightmare".  Jesus Henry Christos:  What can be said about Jesus Henry Christos that hasn't been said before?  Plenty.  Here's a few things that you  didn't  know about your erstwhile savior and current blasphemer:    Currently in his second coming, appearing on Earth as David Blaine.  Miracles performed every night at 9 P.M. at the MGM Grand, but nobody cares.  Even re-crucified himself over the river Thames in London only to be met by endless jeering.  Dejected, returned to his cramped room at the Holiday Inn and ordered Spectravision.   Never had sex with Mary Magdalene, but would have if she looked like Monica Bellucci.  Mary Magdalene wasn't exactly the Charlie Sheen type.   Actually Muslim.   In The Crease:  In The Crease originally wanted the username I Drink My Own Urine but it was taken.  Born in scenic Churchill Manitoba (the polar bear capitol of the world), In The Crease insists that he is the love child of Ferdinand Marcos and Grace Jones.  Both deny such allegations, with Marcos going on to say in comically accented English, "Are you asking me if I've had sex with Grace Jones?  You better fucking believe I did!  And I'll do it again too...but this 'In The Crease' chap freaks me the fuck out.  Anyway, I've never even been to Canada".

      Tonight there'll be a PBS documentary about George Bush's faith.  From the  urlLink [NYTimes article] : "The question is not, When did George W. Bush accept Jesus as his personal savior? The "Frontline" documentary "The Jesus Factor," on PBS tonight, raises a different issue: Do most Americans realize just how fervent the president's evangelical faith really is?"    As if we weren't frightened enough already: "at a time when Mel Gibson's film "The Passion of the Christ" is one of the top-earning movies, and the "Left Behind" series of books, apocalyptic Christian thrillers by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins (the Antichrist heads the United Nations), has outsold John Grisham, the evangelical Christian movement is highly visible even in places like New York and Los Angeles."

      Ah,  urlLink NPR , the bringer of bad news to all kinds of professions due to technology.  Today's profession: endocrinologists.  Apparently some brilliant foreigner has come up with a biological machine that is capable of curing some types of cancer in a lab.  Good thing to know that the job my mom wants me to do will soon be accomplished by single celled organisms.  I wonder if they have to go through 4 years of med school too...  20/20 is also getting some shit as they have created a segment that combines adoption with "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego."  My favorite line "3 couples will lose.  1 will win."  Who the hell says stuff like that about  human life .  Discuss amongst yourselves how you feel.  Another interesting segment is about how they are using acoustics to create a cooling device, which will mean less global warming and colder winters as the cooling system will be “eco-friendly.”(assholes).  Also, if you are observant, you will see a music button that says "Black Star" with a composer Thomas Yorke.  Sound familiar?  It’s that piano remake stuff Jesus always talks about.  Gonna get the CD soon or see the concert.  I'll post on what that is like.  Untill then, remember that ur music still sucks and that I hate you all

      if you pervs can make it past the britney spears story on this  urlLink msn gossip shit , there's some interesting stuff said by kate winslet regarding the mtv show 'i want a famous face'.   urlLink one of the participants  on the show apparently underwent plastic surgery to look like winslet.  winslet says, among other things:   ...she felt it was her duty to watch the show, but admits within minutes she was "crying in horror." "This girl had collected magazine covers with me on the front," she recalls. "And she was saying, 'I really want to have Kate Winslet's breasts. Just look at how well-shaped they are, pert and soft.' And I thought, No, darling, my breasts don't look like that. I've had two kids. It's a digitally altered image!"   the girl that underwent the surgery has this to say:   MTV: Are you pleased with the results of your surgery? JENNETTE: I am more than pleased with the results of the surgery! I feel foxy and ferocious!  [Ed: foxy and ferocious?  really.  that's the best you can come up with?  ferocious?  are you sure you know what these words mean?  okay.  i'll take your word for it.]   MTV: Was it worth it? Why or why not? JENNETTE: I would do the whole thing over again in a heartbeat...I can't even begin to tell you how worth it the whole surgery was.   while i support winslet's grandstanding because i hope it might force women to realize that the images they consume are synthetic, i find it somewhat self-indulgent of her to kinda-sorta imply that her pseudo-celebrity is responsible for this poor sap wanting bigger tits.  but who am i to judge.

      some clown in the house of representatives with a bad tie  urlLink omitted the stupid 'under god' while leading the  house in the pledge of allegiance .  as expected, mother fuckers worked themselves into a frenzy of reckless savagery and insane fury.   Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, accused McDermott of "embarrassing the House and disparaging the majority of Americans who share the values expressed in the pledge.  He and those like him stand more for the liberal left than they do for our friends and neighbors."   this, of course, is related to the current supreme court case  urlLink  Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow  , regarding whether it is constitutional or not to have the pledge (in its current incarnation) recited at all in schools.  the reference to god was not introduced into the pledge until the 1950s, after representative mcdermott had learned the pledge as the cnn article points out.  more information about the previous federal appellate case leading to the supreme court case and subsequent idiotic reactions to it can be found  urlLink at this fucking foxnews.com article .  not to be out done,  urlLink the bbc reports on a new package of sharia laws in the northern nigerian state of zamfara .  even if your monkey ass doesn't read the article, take a look at the sign that the state government put up -- just look at it:     yes, you are not losing your mind.  the fucking welcome sign says:  "welcome to zamfara state.   home of farming and sharia .  we wish you a happy stay."  i'm beginning to see why the excesses of stalinism were necessary.  on a side note, what the fuck are they saying the pledge of allegiance at the house of representatives anyway?  and why do they need someone to lead them in it?  aren't they already wasting enough of my time and money without regressing to second grade?  is the house minority whip peeling a layer of elmer's glue off his hand and freaking out the girl representatives as we speak?

      This seems reminiscent of the NYTimes "Grunge Dictionary" incident about 10 years ago.  Actually, any time the NYTimes reviews something of "pop-cultural" origin (e.g. Eminem's movie 8-mile, Radiohead and Sigur Ros, Mos Def...) I start wondering whether they're overanalyzing.  Sometimes fart jokes and other digestive humor really are just puerile humor.   urlLink [South Park]

      What's the difference between Christian, Islamic and Hindu fundamentalism?  Who knows, but it is wrong to call secret societies such as Opus Dei, which have been denounced as fascist, ( urlLink [Opus Dei]  and the unofficial Opus Dei FAQ  urlLink [Opus Dei FAQ] ) fundamentalist organizations?  Dan Brown's book the Da Vinci code claims to present truthful depictions of the rituals of Opus Dei (see  urlLink [The Da Vinci Code] ).  In other news, Islamic fundamentalists just seem to be more in the news these days:  urlLink [NYTimes] .  And with upcoming Indian elections, who knows what's going to happen.

      wow, even  urlLink bushimus maximus is shouting about emr .  while i'm normally pretty bad at distinguishing between something being an overhyped meme or actually reaching critical mass, i'm unfortunately begining to think that all this political emr discussion is more of the former.  why?  b/c of the picture of bush speaking about it:     show of hands:  how many of you guys think that he just said "paper records are evil.  emr makes hard decisions for our security."?  that look of his can make even an innanimate abstract idea, like emr, look like a douche bag.

      MOAMMAR GADHAFI, the guy that's the leading authority in getting the world to think that people named moammar are fucking insane,  urlLink has said this :   "Libya calls on all countries, from America to China, to discard and get rid of all WMD.  Libya has become an example to be followed ."   he goes on to say more, but that's all you really need to know, and sadly, i think the clown is right.  what kind of fucked up world are we living in where libya has become an example to be followed?  do you realize how fucked up all the other nations in the world have to be if they are looking up to libya?  in any case, i'd normally call any dude with a jerri curl a grade a fucking shit-stain, but this mother fucker has a phalanx of FEMALE BODYGUARDS DRESSED IN BLUE CAMOFLAUGE.  cnn even goes so far as to call it his  trademark .  that, i my book, makes moammar my main man in tripoli.

      if you were interested in the ai article posted by torless, (and you have a computer capable of playing windows media files) you should check out  urlLink this lecture by doug lenat  -- the founder of the cyc project.  it's been a while since i've seen the lecture, but i vaguely remember an extremely interesting section where lenat describes humans as being non-rational or trans-rational or something along those lines.  he goes on to give examples of such non-rationality in human behavior.  i think this opens the door to a certain tension between human and machine intelligence.  if humans (even intelligent and highly trained humans) are indeed non-rational, should we be trusting each other to make important decisions?  collaterally, an  urlLink old and unfortunately no longer freely available nyt's article  talks about research on how difficult it is for people to predict how they will feel in the future.  they called this 'affective forecasting'.  i have a copy of the article lying around, so if you would like to read it and don't have an nyt's subscription, drop me a line.

      i'm sure i've sent you chaps to  urlLink this blog , where personal ads are written to fit the demeanor and style of fashion ads.  memepool reminded me to throw it out there again, b/c seriously, the girl does not dissapoint.  i could ramble for a bit about what the content of the blog says about the media of fashion advertising and/or  urlLink personal ads  (read this link:  it's good), but i'll just hit you with this gem instead:   "Eccentric fashion student seeks playmate.

       urlLink anne galloway comments  on  urlLink justin hall's article  about dating in a mobile society (using mobile in the as many sematic senses as possible).  hall asks:    Have our chances of "hooking up" been augmented by mobile devices? . . . Are mobile phones likely to contribute to any long-term changes in the way humans practice courtship and the pleasure of partnering? As a flood of dating and matchmaking sites jostle to introduce us to more people, faster, will that lead to a proliferation of promiscuity?   as you can imagine, hall ends up asking more questions than he answers, but the article is interesting nonetheless.  the best part of the article is when nalini kotamraju, one of the interviewees, says:   "Casual hook-ups are one of the things that sociologists have done the poorest job with. We just don't know enough about casual sex."   snickering ensues.  (btw,  urlLink her quotes page  has delillo  and  'six degrees of separation'.  that's fucking hot.)  ultimately though, i'm somewhat wary of all this talk of toothing and shit.  does anybody actually do this?  maybe i'm just behind the times....perhaps if i upgraded my cold-war era cellular phone, i would be exposed to the sexual bounty that is sms whoredom (a.k.a. herpes).  but really, even if it does occur -- and occur frequently at that -- does this change anything?  it might amplify an existing behavior, but i don't believe the amplification corresponds to a shift in social mores.

      Well family, after watching my nerdy counter parts do their fair share of blogging for all of South India, i thought that i should join in the tom foolery. So, after many restless nights of thinking about what i do that wastes as much time as Jesus's websurfing/porn hounding, i decidided to share the only thing i know...music. One must understand, however, that i am what is known as a moderate 'hipster,' meaning i'm an asshole when it comes to music. Now that you all know this, i'm gonna hit you a group i just saw perform this weekend.  When trying to describe  urlLink the secret machines , my friends and i had some problems. A very solid rock band to say the least, a friend of mine compared it to a stripped down version of your favorite album and mine--OK computer. Something else i read called the Pink Flyod if Pink Floyd were an indie band. Though i think comparing them to radiohead or Flyod is a bit of a streach, their abilities to weave a romantic sense of music and fluid lyrics allows them to stand out more that most bands. For me, it is not easy to concentrate on just the music or just the lyrics of this band. They go hand in hand so well and seemlessly flow into one sound that works to their advantage. From ballads that build and fall (The leaves are gone) to songs that make you wish you weren't listening to them through your 4x2 inch computer speakers (The Road Lead Where It's Led - my favorite and Pharaoh's Daughter - probably the song that sounds most like Pink Flyod). There sound is quite dynamic for only 3 guys and they have a good variation in their sound. Anyway, go to the website and listen to their streaming album. Their album comes out on May 18th and they are touring this summer. They are also really nice guys, i got to meet them--enjoy

      via  urlLink the medical informatics blog :   urlLink this new study on computerized order entry in ambulatory care settings  is pretty interesting.  for the lazy, here are some stats:   "...save more than $3 billion and prevent nearly 250,000 medication related injuries annually."  "...save individual California providers about $29,000 a year in expenses."  "Also, entering important information directly into a computer would help providers, on average, prevent approximately nine adverse drug reactions each year."  "CPOE systems have been shown to reduce serious medication errors by more than 50 percent, increase compliance with care guidelines, and improve the use of diagnostic tests in inpatient settings. However, adoption of CPOE in ambulatory settings (ACPOE) has been much slower, according to the researchers"   also,  urlLink a little summary of health care problems and opportunities , written by hillary clinton for the nyt mag.

      this shit about  urlLink jesus' foreskin is bananas .  the fact that this is part of church cannon makes all my previous (and future) blasphemies seem like small change.

In the vision, Christ mystically marries her,  and his amputated foreskin is given to her as a wedding ring .   take that de beers.

      according to  urlLink this little ditty about online dating , it fortunately  is  just me.  the article also adds more ammunition to the rampant speculation that  women are insane .  specifically, speaking to the first point:   Sixteen percent of all male participants reported having had a “purely sexual relationship” with a female respondent. . .Thirty-four percent of all females seeking males. . .reported having had a “purely sexual relationship”.   that's basically a 2:1 ratio of female:male whoredom.  strangely, it also means that out of every 100 women, 34 of them are banging the same 16 dudes.  what the fuck is up with that?  if karl marx wrote about getting laid, this is  exactly  the kind of shit he would be railing against.    with regards to the second point:    34 percent  of all females seeking males. . .stated they were “highly unlikely” or “definitely not” willing to meet online matches in person after a brief online courtship.  Only 34 percent of those  stated they were more likely to meet an online partner in person after a lengthy courtship.   for you c-level employees that need the executive summary, this means that a full 11% of all women on  dating sites  have no intention whatsoever to  actually fucking date .  does this make sense?  i'm sure it does if you're a girl.  to bring everything to a tidy conclusion, the combination of these two factors will continue to be the albatross around my neck:  pulling me deeper and deeper into a morass of despair and depravity until my dessicated body is eventually found inside the broom closet of a sudanese whore house.  p.s.:  torless, perhaps you could expound upon this, but i found the numbers striking.  for example, ~10% of the female respondants are superwhores, having more than one purely sexual encounter, while ~10% are superprudes, not even willing to date someone after they put up a personal on a dating site.  coincidental symmetry? even more interesting:  a standard deviation contains 68% of a (sub)population, meaning that it excludes 32%.  and what number kept popping up with regards to female sexual behavior?:  34%.  another coincidence?  i don't know, but i'm begining to think that female whoredom is a normally distributed gaussian,  with whores being only one sigma away from the average girl .  if my math is right, then superwhores are 2 sigmas away.

      Our great guru has abandoned us--we have been left to our own devices and shall run rampant upon this earth.  Where have you gone o guru?  Why hast thou forsaken us?    In your stead I shall tell a story.  The setting: the student coffee house at a major university.  The story: boy has crush on girl.  However, boy is intensely shy and unable to muster courage to talk to girl.  (Sounds like the beginning of many stories)  Boy pines after girl for 5 weeks, returning every day to coffee shop just to sit around girl.  Eventually girl notices something and talks to boy.  Boy is ecstatic and buys girl coffee.  Girl smiles and accepts.  The beginning of a beautiful romance?  Not in this university.  Girl accuses boy of being a stalker.  Laughable?  Sad?  Absurd?  Maybe all of the above, but also a true story and not the first time we've heard this story from the hallowed halls of ivy.

      this  urlLink business 2.0 article  has an interview with the a9.com project lead.  the interviewer proposes a really interesting future direction for a9, which the lead unfortunately kinda refutes:   By overlaying what you're looking for onto what you've already found -- and, ultimately, what you've consumed -- A9 aims for the holy grail of search and e-commerce. While others have tried to create personalized interfaces, none has worked so far. Users don't like to answer questionnaires about what they like and what they don't; often they lie. But Amazon already knows who you are -- or at least, what you buy. With A9, the company can factor in what you browse and search for as well.  And the best part, from Amazon's perspective, is that the more things you buy at Amazon, and the more you browse with A9, the better the company will know you. Ideally, it's win-win -- you get better results, Amazon gets more sales.

      and that's the  urlLink fucking truth !  amazon's new search service  urlLink a9  is pretty rad, but that is just too fucking weird mang!  in case you were wondering (and are too fucking lazy to click the fucking link), there were about 400 results from within the searchable books on amazon.  for comparison,  urlLink searching for handjob on a9  turns up 861 web results, and 97 book results.   urlLink searching for ANALINGUS  turned up 361 web results and 50 book results.  so this begs the question:  what does amazon have against blowjobs?  other than this glaring -- GLARING -- omission, a9 is pretty fucking rad; i wish i was writing some type of research paper so that i could combine the power of searching the web with searching the texts of books.  all the other niceties of a9 are pretty impressive too, such as the search history and the followed link history.  i wish i could try out their toolbar b/c their diary feature sounds rad, but i aint tryin to use no internet explorer, ya heard?  perhaps you haven't.  i even think the ui is awesome -- with its draggable/resizable elements and what not --, and i'm not even really a ui geek.

      if you know me, then you know that i jack off to the possibility of moving the health care industry towards a paperless office.   urlLink openEMR  (electronic medical records) is a GPL'ed project working towards the same goal.  it's web based, which i'm actually not that big of a fan of, but i can see the administration benefits.  i just think that web apps are kinda kludgey when it comes to flow.  i wish i could play around with something like  urlLink flex  or java webstart for creating rich internet applications for emr.  anyway, a couple of clinics that are running openEMR have  urlLink submitted   urlLink testimonials  that speak very highly of the paperless office in general and openEMR specifically.  one of these peeps even uses the tablet pc's that tizza has been yapping about.  from comments, it looks like the product needs some integration with some billing software along with the ability to order and receive lab reports, but the future looks bright for emr and medical informatics in general.  at least i hope so.  on a related note, a couple of  urlLink medical informatics   urlLink blogs  (which is where i picked up on the openEMR success stories).

      i want to buy the  urlLink ann "goebbels with tits" coulter doll  and the  urlLink jesus doll  and make them hump each other.  there are some other cool dolls at both  urlLink websites  (unfortunately (fortunately?), the right wing neo-nazi dolls do not have their own page, but if you scroll down on the ann coulter doll page, there are links on the left).  tangentially, there is only one page that google returns when searching for the phrase "ann coulter is a stupid fucking  urlLink cunt ".  hopefully, this humble blog will work to remedy this situation.  i encourage my fellow posters to sprinkle their posts/comments with any such syntactical variant that maintains the semantic purpose of the quotation in question.  because if google doesn't think that ann coulter is a  urlLink cunt , then the terrorists really have won.

      Finally got around to reading some Vonnegut.  What better place to start than Slaughterhouse 5?  Schlachthof Funf!  As our erstwhile leader would say: "How many times do I have to tell you that I don't speak Nazi."  I owe you five kowtows and a walk in a field of caltrops Jesus Henry.  Some random information for those of you who appreciate that kind of Trivia.  I guess the firebombing of Dresden fits into one of the general themes of this page.  Kilgore Trout is Vonnegut's alter ego: based loosely on the actual sci-fi writer Theodore Sturgeon.  "His stories get published only in porn magazines (such as the Black Garterbelt). The reason is simple: They cover the space between 'wide-open-beaver' photos and are incredibly cheap (Nobody reads them anyway). [ urlLink Kilgore Trout ]"  Was Howard W. Cambell Jr. really a Nazi sympathizer?  Well, check out Vonnegut's other book Mother Night.  [ urlLink Mother Night ].  Ilium was the site of the Trojan war. [ urlLink Ilium ].  Finally, and this is the best, but Tralfamadore also appears in Vonnegut's Sirens of Titan.  [ urlLink Tralfamadore ][ urlLink Sirens of Titan ].

      just saw  urlLink 'the kite'  starring  urlLink this   urlLink little   urlLink strumpet  who i would gladly step on a landmine for. this excellent movie takes place along the border of lebanon and israel, and is about a lot of things. . . mostly revolving around fresh young 15 year old olive skin, pouty lips, and legs that go all the way up to here.  what most people forget about this war torn political hotbed -- and the point that this movie really hammers home -- is that israeli, jordanian, syrian, and lebanese girls are FUCKING HOTTER THAN SHIT.  i can't remember the last time i have met a girl from any of those countries and not jacked off to them.  don't believe me?   urlLink BOOYAH!!  in summary:  kikes and towel-heads, why the fuck are you fucking throwing rocks/hellfire missles at each other when you should be fucking all the hot girls over there?  seriously.

      wow,  urlLink these predictions (accusations?) about where google will go next  are pretty crazy/impressive (definitely take the time to at least read  urlLink the kottke post ). google really has become more of a 'second computer' than i could have imagined.  i use it to fucking  spellcheck  for christ's sake.  it probably has enhanced (or at least changed) my life in more ways that i would care to admit. i even have this crazy idea floating in my head of google haves and have-nots:  a distinction made between people who can and can't formulate good search querries, resulting in an information imbalance that goes on to influence effeciency/efficacy/enjoyment in work and personal life. but that's just me talking, and i spend 20 hours a day infront of a god damn computer, so maybe  real  people are concerned more about stuff like american idol or the apprentice whatever than any of the things that google provides.

"An artist was an artist — he got paid a salary. There weren't royalties for artists or composers. Everything was owned by the state — for 70 years intellectual property rights never existed."

      went to a seminar this morning on the dept. of defense's new electronic medical records system,  urlLink chcs II (composite health care system II)  (also see this  urlLink article on the system ).  the stated goals of the system (which is used at every us military medical hospital in the world and even in the theater of opperations) are to:   provide longitudinal access to patient records  ease of use  enhance epidemiological knowledge and response   the first two are givens, but i thought it was great that they are explicitly looking to enhance their public health stance within the military population -- the speaker specifically mentioned gulf war syndrome.  the system's ui is a fat client which i think is a good thing (although i wish it was a rich-thin-client).  it's built to look a lot like outlook, and the practicioner enters data by chaining together concepts from a tree widget.  so the practicioner does not type free text into the system, but constructs medical observations through a predefined and heirarchically organized vocabulary (if you're wondering it's not  urlLink umls , it's not  urlLink snowmed ct , the vocabular was internally developed but can be mapped to all the other vocabs if necessary).  not only does this prevent the vocabulary normalization nightmare inherent to medical records (e.g., 10 different descriptions for sinusitis), but it  also automatically saturates the medical record with additional information such as meta-data and billing/order codes.  the downside is that you have to drill down trees all day, which can probably be frustrating, although the speaker did not mention any usability data.  one interesting point made was that the system captures  events  instead of  facts .  that is, instead of storing something like, 'blood pressure is 120/80', the system stores 'nurse jenkins observed mr. smith's blood pressure to be 120/80 on friday, june 4th using a digital pressure cuff'.  i guess this has no immediate benefit, but it should provide a much richer substrate for data-mining.  another interesting architectural decision involved the database schema:  they are basically using two different databases, one for regular information transactions, and one for report querries, both of which seemed strangely simplistic.  the 'report' database -- which is populated from the 'regular' database -- has a schema that you would probably consider normal, that is, the rows are patients, and the columns are clinical observations such as pulse, bp, etc:   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | patient | blood pressure | pulse | bun | creatinine | ... | potassium | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 23423   | 120/80         |  70   |  20 |    10      | ... |    5      | | 44133   | 160/110        |  80   |  30 |    15      | ... |    5      | | 729113  | 110/70         |  60   |  15 |    7.5     | ... |    5      | -------------------------------------------------------------------------   the 'regular' database actually has kind of a weird schema, that looks something like this:   --------------------------------------------------- | patient |    test type             |    result  | --------------------------------------------------- | 23423   | blood pressure           | 120/80     | | 23423   | pulse                    | 70         | | 44133   | bun                      | 30         | | 729113  | age                      | 27         | ---------------------------------------------------   as you can see, it looks really ineffecient, but the reason why they made it this way is that new  types  of tests are always being added to the clinical repertoire.  for example, they had to start recording pain as a clinical observation, so if they had a typical schema like the one in the 'report' db, then they would have had to add a column, which is bad database hygiene.  with this seemingly oversimplistic schema, a new clinical observation is just another row, so you don't have to drop tables and all that nonsense.  since the 'report' db is constructed with data from the 'regular' db, it's not a big deal to rebuild it with a new column.

       urlLink patrick logan  points to this  urlLink two part   urlLink discussion  with berkeley linguist  urlLink george lakoff  on the use of language to frame political issues.   Right now the Democratic Party is into marketing. They pick a number of issues like prescription drugs and Social Security and ask which ones sell best across the spectrum, and they run on those issues. They have no moral perspective, no general values, no identity. People vote their identity, they don't just vote on the issues, and Democrats don't understand that. Look at Schwarzenegger, who says nothing about the issues. The Democrats ask, How could anyone vote for this guy? They did because he put forth an identity. Voters knew who he is.  [...]  Also, within traditional liberalism you have a history of rational thought that was born out of the Enlightenment: all meanings should be literal, and everything should follow logically. So if you just tell people the facts, that should be enough — the truth shall set you free. All people are fully rational, so if you tell them the truth, they should reach the right conclusions. That, of course, has been a disaster.  while i agree that republicans have utilized and subsequently benefitted from framing much more than progressives, i am not sure that i want the left to follow suit.  my association with the left stems partially from their proclivity to treat the electorate as rational adults -- i am not entirely against some of the goals of the conservative movement, but i find their recontextualizations and over-simplifications extremely off-putting.  if progressives do end up mimicing their conservative bretheren, i worry that politics will sink even further into the quagmire.   urlLink the o'franken factor  is a perfect example of this.  i understand the intent, and i sympathize, but i just can't deal with it.  (btw, is it just me, or does janeane garofalo look totally hot with the blonde hair?)  on a related note,  urlLink design observer  talks about the use of  urlLink marketing in the recent indian elections .  i thought the discussion and comments were quite interesting.  and finally, here are some  urlLink other   urlLink articles  by george lakoff on language and politics/war.

       urlLink     fuck, did you know that  urlLink grep has a --color option ?  don't lie, none of your asses did either.  this is probably the biggest news that i've heard in the past decade.  i'm on the verge of adding "alias grep='grep --color'" to my .bashrc, which, to a nerd, is basically on the same level as getting hitched.  there are some other good unix-y tips in the post, but i doubt i will ever be able to break the "pipe grep to wc" habit.   urlLink

      from the  urlLink pen of some indian :   Jamshedpur girl  urlLink Tanushree   urlLink Dutta , 21, was crowned Ponds Femina Miss India Universe 2004 at a glittering ceremony in Mumbai on Saturday night. [...] Dutta's reply to actor Sanjay Dutt's question in the final round, whether there was a healthy competition when only one wins, won her the crown.  The audience broke into applause when she replied, "When there is unhealthy competition everybody is a loser."  wow, that's all it takes to win the crown?  i think it has more to do with her eminently chewable ass:              after securing the title of miss india, ms. dutta jetted off to scenic quito equador (incidentally, the world's second highest altitude capital after la paz, bolivia) to compete in the miss universe competition.  from there, she will visit new york to date tom cruise and be used as a sacrifice to l. ron hubbard.  just think:  only a few years ago, girls rocking bikinis in india would find their asses being thrown down well shafts by the in-laws (legally).  this, my friends, is the very sight of progress.  so gentlemen, i beseech you, stroke away.  and stroke with a clear conscience.

       urlLink     i gotta admit, blogger's photoblogging system is kinda cool.  it makes me wish i had more than just fake nudes of mandy moore to share with you guys.  it all works through  " urlLink hello " , a new chat client which kinda sucks and is kinda cool at the same time.  the sucky part is of course that the last thing the world needs is another chat client/network.  also adding to the suckage is that the  hello  client is windows only.  what's cool is that you just drag a photo into the chat client, write the caption right there, and then send it off -- and blogger hosts the images for me.  all the resizing, html tags, etc. is taken care of by the  hello  client.  before, i had to jump trough a few more hoops to put images up, so i definitely appreciate what they have going on over here.  interestingly,  hello  is an  urlLink idealab!  company.  if you don't remember, idealab! was the much heralded, and then much maligned, .com incubator that got a lot of press during the boom.  it's good to see that they are still around and kicking and putting out good products.   oh, another crappy thing?  you can't add post titles directly in the client:  you have to go in through blogger and edit them yourself.    urlLink

      back when i was a smoker, every time i saw an anti-smoking advertisement, i would light one up out of a sense of solidarity.  i think that the  urlLink anti-smoking packaging scheme currently employed by canada  and some european nations would have stopped my nascent unionist tendancies cold.  cigarette packages in canada are required to place anti-smoking literature over 50% of the package.  the iconography often shows diseased tissues and is quite graphic, as you can see in the link above.  inside the packages are tips on how to quit smoking.  the campaign seems to be  urlLink successful :   44% of smokers say the warnings increased their motivation to quit  58% said the warnings made them think more about the health effects of smoking  62% say the new warnings make the packages look less attractive   from a  urlLink cnn.com article :   43% of smokers and 40 percent of nonsmokers said they are more concerned about the health effects of smoking because of the new warnings  21% of smokers said they have been tempted on one or more occasions to have a cigarette but decided not to because of the new warnings  27% of smokers said they smoke less inside their home because of the new warnings  35% of smokers and 34 percent of nonsmokers said they know more about the health effects of smoking than they did before the new warnings  48% of nonsmokers said the new warnings made them feel better about being a nonsmoker  17% of smokers said they have put their cigarette pack away at least once because they did not want others to see the warning  24% of smokers said they have at least once put a cardboard sleeve over their pack or transferred cigarettes to another container  18% of smokers said they have on at least one occasion asked for a different package of cigarettes when purchasing them because they did not like the warning on the package first offered  In addition, smokers and nonsmokers identified the warning depicting a diseased mouth and the picture of a lung tumor as most effective at discouraging smoking.    however, as you can see from the fact that people transfer the cigarettes to different containers, there is a niche industry that has grown to serve the needs of smokers who do not want to be reminded of the consequences of their actions.  apparently, one french company makes a cardboard sleeve to place over your pack that is emblazoned with the image of che guevara, which i am  dying  to see a picture of, but i couldn't find it...the closest i got was this picture of che guevara  urlLink rolling papers :     others have started distributing stickers over the internet that you can print out at home and stick over the images.  some good ones are  urlLink here :

       urlLink the believer  has the  urlLink transcript of a conversation  between  urlLink terry   urlLink gilliam  and  urlLink salman   urlLink rushdie  that i found interesting.  at one point, gilliam's  urlLink  'brazil'   ( urlLink imdb page ) was my absolute favorite movie, but now, the reality of the american police state blunts the movie's expressivity and imagination -- what was once predicted and cautioned against (and laughed at) is now occurring with public permission and approval.  in any case, it's still a great movie, as is  ' urlLink twelve   urlLink monkeys ' .   TG: Well, I really want to encourage a kind of fantasy, a kind of magic. I love the term magic realism, whoever invented it—I do actually like it because it says certain things. It's about expanding how you see the world. I think we live in an age where we're just hammered, hammered to think this is what the world is. Television's saying, everything's saying "That's the world." And it's not the world. The world is a million possible things.  SR: And the world is about the way in which our dreams intersect with our real life. Endlessly, the world of the imagination changes the world.  TG: But the dreams that are being offered are just whiter teeth, or thicker toilet paper. Things like that. [Mimics TV voice] Dream of three-ply toilet paper. After a real bout of diarrhea... But these are the dreams that are being offered up to us. It's appalling. I just feel it's compressing and compressing. And then when you see sci-fi films they're not really doing it. They're not taking you to a place where you can really stretch your world. And I think that's one of the big problems with Hollywood dominating the world as far as cinema—it's slowly squishing it down everywhere. Except living outside the States, it's easier to rebel against.  also, watch as rushdie makes us all wish we had a  fathwah  placed on our head:       UPDATE:  i forgot to put some things in the post, so here they are.  via  urlLink quadrantcrossing : here's a highly political  urlLink interview with gilliam in the onion's a/v page  that you should definitely check out.   Fear And Loathing, in a strange way, was like that. It was interesting: When we made it, I felt the prime audience would have been college students, who were ripe and ready to consider new ideas—or old ideas, at least—of anarchy, or whatever. But the college kids, it didn't seem to work for them as I'd hoped. And I discovered that what seemed to be the prime audience... The ones who were really receptive were high-school students, who hadn't yet committed to their careers. College used to be about expanding your mind, and ideas, and now it seems to be just stage one of your career, and if you don't do well in college, you might as well just commit suicide, like Japanese students used to do in the old days. But the high-school kids were still open-minded and willing to consider things. A lot of college kids, the film seemed to worry them, I think because it was too anarchic for them. It's just a theory, though. I have no proof of any of this.

      some bollywood actress that i've never heard of named preity zinta has  urlLink written an editorial  on the bbc about indian men acting like barbarians.  personally, i believe that it's my birthright as an indian male [which i am not] to grab girl's asses in the malls of delhi or caress their bossoms as they sleep on the train to lucknow.  plus, i should be allowed to grow a mustache, wear aviator sunglasses, and have a hairy chest.   On view are videos where the camera zooms in and out of the girl's anatomy, accompanied by vulgar and crude remix music which single-mindedly murders classic Indian film songs.  There is one video in which a man on a train has a drink and sees a properly dressed girl morphing into a little sex kitten in a bikini top and a slit skirt. Then they begin a dirty dance inside the compartment.  [....]  It's all about men imitating all the dangerously sexist images of women that our media spits out day and night. I daresay that some of today's cinema is also to blame.  Unlike the Hindi film heroine of yesteryear, who was largely the epitome of purity and had a certain dignity, there is today an emerging "genre" of B-grade skin flicks that showcase "sexy" heroines in slinky costumes.  In one such film, the hero grabs his heroine on a smoky strobe-lit dance floor and orders her to stare at him till she goes weak in the knees and begins breathing heavily. All this in their first interaction!  too bad she doesn't mention the titles of the videos and 'b-grade skin flicks'...i think i would watch them religiously.  i think that her editorial addresses little more than the stupidity of indian men, and while she is correct in viewing such behavior with contempt, i wish ms. zinta would have addressed the growing problem of real violence against south asian women that exists somewhat orthogonally to pinched asses.  please visit  urlLink sakhi's website  for more information about what you can do to help (either through donations, attending fund raisers, or by spreading the word).

      just finished watching  urlLink this lecture  on  urlLink mitworld  about campaign finance entitled ' political advertising, free speech and the problem of campaign reform '.  the speech was given by  urlLink stephen ansolabehere , a professor of political science at mit and author of a book on negative campaign ads, ' urlLink  going negative  '.  the lecture starts out by going over both the history of money as speech (i.e.,  urlLink buckley v. valeo ) and the amounts/sources of money going into campaigns.  for example, $3 billion was spent in the last round of federal elections:  congressional candidates spent $1 billion of that money, parties spent another $1.1 billion for god knows what (likely hookers), and the remaining $0.74 billion was spent in the presidential election.  ansolabehere goes on to say that it basically costs $40 to get someone to vote.  the possible issues related to the explosive growth in campaign spending in the past 30-40 years are then presented.  his research shows that campaign donations lead to virtually no corruption; that is, spending money on candidates does not lead to  quid pro quo  private benefits.  however, his research has shown that the current structure of campaign finance results in financially weighted voting -- that is, since it costs $40 to get someone to vote, a donation of $2000 will increase your individual vote by a  factor of 50 .  so if you are aligned with a particular candidate's ideology, then you can influence the outcome of the election through spending.  the data he presents shows that campaign contributions come from a constant fraction of 8% of the population, and -- not surprisingly -- of that 8%, 91% are from the top quintile of wage earners.  that is, the richest 20% of the population have  12 times  the voting power as the remaining 80% of the populace.  another interesting factiod that he threw out there is that spending -- when adjusted for gdp -- has remained relatively flat since the 1940's.  england, sweden, and italy have all show this same phenomenon of election spending existing as a constant fraction of the society's income.  personally, i find his results to be slightly less dramatic than what i would have expected, especially with regards to the non-existance of corruption.  perhaps i am just so anti-lobby that i want to believe that campaign contributions corrupt governemnt much more than they actually do.  however, i think that other research, such as that done by  urlLink the center for responsive politics , shows much stronger connections between donations and access to the political process.  in this  urlLink ' washington journal ' episode , larry makinson (senior fellow at the center for responsive politics) discusses not only how money buys politicians seats, but also how those politicians are then indebted to the donors who put them in office.  for example, his research shows that 94% of the time, the candidate who spends the most money wins the race, and in 2/3 of the congressional districts, 1 candidate  spent   spends   10 times  more money than the other candidate.  (incidentally, he says that $900,000 is the going price for a seat in the house of representatives).  in a different speech i heard him give on c-span radio (i couldn't find it archived), he goes on to show how that money required to win a seat ends up corrupting the politician's voting pattern.  so, perhaps it isn't possible to approach a sitting politician and offer money for a vote, but it is possible to plant a kernel of corruption during election time through the application of funding stress.  c-span has  urlLink another clip  of the executive director & general council for the center for responsive politics appearing before the federal election commission and proposing limiting the spending of 527 groups, although i haven't gotten a chance to watch it yet, so if any of you guys watch it before i update this post, let me know what you think in the comments.  (also, check out  urlLink the national voting rights institute  for more news about campaign finance and reform)

      perhaps you've noticed the advertisements at the top of the page?  well, the way it works is that google 'reads' the blog and then constructs an advertisement that would be most relavent to the viewers of the blog.  have a look at the ad that i saw this afternoon on fratocrates:     yes, that is right, not only does google think that this blog is a raging alcoholic, but it also thinks that we suffer from   urlLink BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER  :    Linehan theorizes that borderlines are born with an innate biological tendency to react more intensely to lower levels of stress than others and to take longer to recover. They peak "higher" emotionally on less provocation and take longer coming down. In addition, they were raised in environments in which their beliefs about themselves and their environment were continually devalued and invalidated. These factors combine to create adults who are uncertain of the truth of their own feelings and who are confronted by three basic dialectics they have failed to master (and thus rush frantically from pole to pole of):    vulnerability vs invalidation  active passivity (tendency to be passive when confronted with a problem and actively seek a rescuer) vs apparent competence (appearing to be capable when in reality internally things are falling apart)  unremitting crises vs inhibited grief.     well, there you have it:  we're fucking idiots.

       urlLink memepool  linked to some sites discussing  urlLink modern   urlLink prefabricated   urlLink housing  (as in  urlLink international modernism ).  while prefab has somewhat of a derogatory connotation, especially when applied to big ticket items such as housing or aesthetic concerns such as architecture, the mass production technique falls in line with the goals of the modernist movement.  in addition, making the modernist aestetic more accessible could help reverse the  urlLink mcmansion-ization  of  urlLink america .  as this  urlLink newsweek article  says:   Design is everywhere, right? Your toothbrush, your running shoes, your cool-looking couch, your latte machine, your laptop. OK, no one would mistake Indiana for Italy, but you can finally buy good design almost anywhere, from the mall to the Internet. But there’s one big-ticket item in this country that is virtually untouched by the hand of a good designer: your house. [...] It makes me wonder whatever happened to the modern house, and why the core idea of modernism—that through mass production, ordinary people could afford the best design—never caught on when it came to houses. Le Corbusier called the house “a machine for living in”—which meant, notes New York architect Deborah Gans, that the house is a tool people control, not the other way round. The brilliance of the modern house was in the flexible spaces that flowed one to the next, and in the simplicity and toughness of the materials. Postwar America saw a few great experiments, most famously in L.A.’s Case Study Houses in the late 1940s and ’50s. Occasionally, a visionary developer, such as Joseph Eichler in California, used good modern architects to design his subdivisions. Today they’re high-priced collectibles.   on the other hand, we have what will surely be the focus of innumberable semiotics doctoral theses at brown:   urlLink prefabricated warehouse-style loft subdivisions .  i think we've all come to accept that actual urban lofts are now appropriated for yuppies instead of artists, and mcmansions have indelibly constricted the relatively open proportionality of suburbs, but now  entire subdivisions  of  fake lofts  are being built mcmansion-style in the suburbs.  house size lofts   urlLink with garages  .  as the metropolis article puts it:   My talent is discovering the places where hipness goes to die. I drive around the country and stumble on phenomena that make me realize that something I once valued is about to be eaten alive by mindless commerce.   i'm reminded of the tagline of the movie   urlLink the last big thing  :  "the culture is going down on itself".....but i guess this should all be expected.

      this  urlLink lecture (pdf)  by ira glass of ' urlLink this american life ' and chris ware (who wrote the comic book ' urlLink jimmy corrigan: the smartest kid on earth ') is great.  it's more of a conversation/colloquium than a lecture, but seriously, if you are interested in art or media or expression in general, you should check it out.  it's 80 pages long, but a great read.  there are so many parts that i wanted to blockquote in the post b/c i'm afraid that none of you are going to read it, but the post would end up being 20 pages long, so i'm going to just put up a few parts that i thought were great:   Ira Glass: Before you start them, could you just talk about that transition that happened with Potato Man? What, what happened in that transition? Chris Ware: Uh…a girl broke up with me. That was, that was—it’s the truth. There’s a sort of sense of desperation, I guess, at that point—where I felt like nothing mattered anymore, and it seemed silly to try to invest… art, especially the art that I was doing in school, with such power, in—I don’t really know how—a way to put it, it just seemed like there was just too much weight being put on art as being dangerous, or something, and I just wanted the art basically to be my friend. That sounds pathetic, but I mean—it’s true. [...] This is when I started to get more and more self-indulgent in art school, because I realized it didn’t matter who cared, you know, it’s just art. It’s just all gonna, you know, be buried in a hundred years anyway, who cares. So much pressure’s put on an artist to make something that seems relevant, and what’s the point? I could get hit by a truck tomorrow, what difference does it make? Actually, one of my friends was hit by a truck, in art school, so…. [...] Ira Glass: Well then, well actually, well actually, like—somebody will talk and be making their big point and you just feel like—as a producer, you feel like, “Oh, I want to slow them down.” Because, because the point will have more emotion and will come across to the listener with the emotion that the person’s feeling more if you slow them down. And so, we’re constantly taking, like, these tiny little pieces of—of blank time and inserting it between words to change the pacing. Chris Ware: Wow. Ira Glass: Yeah. [...] like sometimes people will say, “Well, how come the people on public radio just seem so much more articulate than people you meet?” And it’s because, man, we have edited out everything extraneous. You know, they’re talking better than they’ve ever talked in their lives. You know? And, and uh, you know, we’re making a more perfect version of them than could ever exist in nature. And… [audience laughter] And my feeling about it is like, it’s, it’s, it’s such an artificial, um, it’s such an artificial thing to sit down and tape somebody to start with. ... Suddenly I sound like Michel Foucault. [...] Chris Ware: Oh, no, maybe not as sad and miserable. I don’t want to—you know, just—I’m not trying to make, you know, depress people or anything. I guess I get accused of that, sometimes. I’m really not, you know. It’s like, I don’t want, you know, it’s not—this is not a guidebook on how to live your life. [audience laughter] There’s plenty of miserable, lonely people in the world and there’s not enough art about it, I don’t think. I, you know—I get tired of reading stories about sexual liaisons and, you know, and conquests and all that kind of nonsense, it just gets tiresome. There’s plenty of that stuff, I mean. I don’t know, I guess I’m nuts or something. Ira Glass: Happy-happy people have the Friends. [some audience hissing] Chris Ware: What?  Ira Glass: Happy people have the TV show Friends. [audience chuckles] Chris Ware: No, but I mean, you ride the bus, you ride the train, and you see so many people that you know they’ll never meet anybody. I mean, you can tell. And it’s, I mean it’s— [...] But I think, I mean it’s certainly, Charles Schultz could – could have been accused of being Charlie Brown, and that’s why he cared so much about Charlie Brown, I think. Did anybody ever see the last interview that Charles Schultz ever did? Really? It was amazing, he… it was when he announced his retirement, shortly before he died, and… I… happened to see it on a plane, my wife nudged me an- and, you know, “Put on your headphones” and I put ‘em on, and then I watched Charles Schultz talk about the ending of his comic strip and as soon as he had to mention the name of any of his characters, he burst in hysterical tears and uh, I realized, like, he, he couldn’t bear to, to imagine living without these characters, which is why he died, I think, partly. I mean, that’s kind of a romantic notion, but…he was an amazing cartoonist, I think he’s the only cartoonist to ever…ever put that sort of feeling into cartoons, and, into, into his characters. He cared more about Charlie Brown than anybody did, so.   don't worry, we'll be back to speculating over lindsay lohan's labial symmetry soon.

      any idea what it means?  no, not a reference to our country's greatest defense secretary [sic].  it's a pennsylvania dutch (ie, amish) word that means "running wild" and describes the break that amish youth take when they turn 16 -- they are allowed to experience the 'outside' world, testing the youth's faith by unencumbering them from the rules that permeate the normal day to day lives of the amish.  if they choose not to return, they are forever shunned from their communities.  growing up next to a large amish population, i remember seeing a bunch of amish kids at the go-kart track when i was younger.  i thought that they had snuck off the farm, but i guess they were on their rumspringa.     the period is probably most famously portrayed in lucy walker's documentary ' urlLink devil's playground '.  some choice snippets from the description and reviews:   This Sundance Festival sensation has attracted attention because of its jarring images of Amish kids immersed in debauchery: plain-dressed girls in white bonnets slugging back beers and flicking ashes from their cigarettes, boys passing out in the back of pickups after all-night parties, even Amish teens in bed together   When given their first taste of adult freedom, Amish teenagers do what any other teenagers do: they drink too much, have sex, and spend a lot of time driving around in cars. For most teenagers this is just a phase. For the Amish it's the preliminary to the most important decision of their life: whether or not to join the Amish church. The subjects of Walker's documentary are no better prepared for the trials of adolescence than any other group of sixteen year olds, and it comes as no surprise that most of them, after a few tumultuous years, seem ready to return to a way of life that represents family, security, and a rock-solid sense of identity.   urlLink npr also has a report  on the film and the practice, but the thing that reminded me of rumspringa is the future upn show ' urlLink amish in the city '.  sometimes, i wish i watched tv....like when the olsen twins hosted snl.  i still can't believe i gave up seeing my girls for ideological reasons.   UPDATE:  i just finished listening to the npr bit on the movie, and ms. walker points out that the 85-90% post-rumspringal return rate is the highest that it has ever been in the almost 400 year history of the church.  perhaps this points to a degredation or an emptiness of the 'english' world.  although, perhaps the amish on rumspringa still believe in the soul/afterlife, and they return to the amish church more out of a fear than out of a desire.  in any case, interesting stuff.

      sometimes i think that the only reason that you guys are friends with me is because i do all the things that you are not allowed/too embarassed to do, find the cream of the crop, and then report back to you.  with that in mind, i present to you  urlLink this fleshbot post  with about 100 lindsay lohan links, most of which  urlLink call into question  the  urlLink incorruptibility  of her  urlLink tits .    if nothing else, read the  urlLink nerve.com review of  'mean girls'   written by a gay man who now questions his sexuality because dear miss lohan is so hot fucking hot.  feel his angst and inner turmoil as he waxes poetic:    Only Ms. Lohan has found a way to sit perfectly in the enigmatic middle of the Madonna/whore spectrum. On one side we have the blatant, unthinking sluttiness of Britney, Christina and Jessica; on the other we have the near-Mormon purity of the Olsen Twins and Hillary Duff. And then there is Lindsay Lohan.   if ever there has been a doctoral thesis on 17 year old asses, then this is it.

      Anyone who has spent a few hours on the internet knows the joys and pains of randomly following links.  Here's a transcript of one of my more recent sessions.  It begins at  urlLink [The Onion] .  Girls at sci-fi conventions getting attention.  Hehe:  "The attention led Osley to flirt with Farscape actor Paul Goddard during an autograph signing. After handing Goddard a poster to sign, Osley said he could sign anywhere he wanted. Laughing coyly, she added, 'And I mean anywhere.'"  In any case, I then needed to know who Paul Goddard was after I found out that he was in The Matrix (Agent Brown).  So I went, where else, to  urlLink [IMDB]  and searched for Paul Goddard.  I was hooked when I found out that Paul Goddard had been in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.  The  urlLink [online review]  of this movie has to be one of the funniest ever.  Some snippets:  "It starts off with a ropy, would-be Star Wars scrolling narration voiced by an uncredited female. This mystery lady sounds alternately drunk, not comprehending what she's saying, and like she's got a large cactus stuffed up her rectum."  The review made me wonder what ever happened to those good ol' TV shows we watched as kids.  For example :  urlLink [Transformers] .  Leonard Nimoy, Judd Nelson and Orson Welles were voices for this movie and Weird Al helped write the soundtrack...    Yes, pathetic. I know...

      What to make of statistics.  Scientists claim that the earth got "darker" in the last half of the 20th century.    "Defying expectation and easy explanation, hundreds of instruments around the world recorded a drop in sunshine reaching the surface of Earth, as much as 10 percent from the late 1950's to the early 90's, or 2 percent to 3 percent a decade."  from  urlLink [NYTimes] .  And we've got another disaster movie coming, but this time it regards global warming  urlLink [The Day After Tomorrow] , and its inflaming people  urlLink [NYTimes] .  Apparently,  urlLink [MoveOn]  believes that the "right" doesn't want us to see this  urlLink [movie] .    What to make of all this?

      What's in a grade?  A grade is supposed to be a measure of how much one actually "understands" the material taught in a class.  Right?  Well then, the "best" grading policy is the one that conveys the most information about the largest number of people in a given class.  Loosely anyway.  Here's an information theoretic assessment of grades at Princeton:  urlLink [Information Theory] .  The actual faculty proposals:  urlLink [Grade proposals] .    I wonder about the efficacy of combating grade inflation at the level of policy.  Perhaps what's really required is some kind of instruction for professors/TAs in how to grade.

      as our schizoid, paranoid, narcisstic and avoidant young torless spews his white-power fueled vitriol against neurodiversity in  urlLink his 'mental disabilities revisited' post , i was reminded of  urlLink the xanadu project , described most famously in this  urlLink long but greatly enjoyable early wired article  which i encourage you all to read when you get a chance. (how i miss the days before wired was killed by cond&eacute; nast.)  the amazing xanadu system (which is like the web on steroids) was designed by ted nelson, a man with ADD.  the system seems to have been created as a function of nelson's needs as a person with ADD, and i believe that such a system would not have been thought of if it weren't for the existence of such unique needs.  and as for autism, there was that guy, raymond babbitt, who beat the house in vegas and taught his younger brother, tom cruise, what it meant to be part of a family.  that was great...

      i've been sitting on these for awhile, but i thought i'd dump them now that i have a few minutes:   this  urlLink eweek article  talks about the use of telemedicine for at home care of the elderly in a dutch province.  the use of telemedicine will be examined in this 3 year pilot program because of the predicted growth of the elderly population.   the portion of the Dutch population aged 65 years or older will nearly double from 13 percent today to 25 percent by 2020. As a result, collective health care costs are expected to double, too.  the use of telemedicine is not new, but i found it interesting that countries that have progressive and humanistic health care policies are also being forced to cut costs.  the article gives another example of this trend:   Among services and medications recently scrapped from the standard health care package are the birth control pill and subsidies for home-care patients...   in case you're wondering, they providers of this service hope to eventually offer it for under US$24/month.    urlLink the medical informatics weblog   urlLink picked up on  another eweek article -- this time on  urlLink wellpoint's eprescription effort .  incase you don't know,  urlLink wellpoint  will be the nation's largest healthcare provider after it merges with  urlLink anthem  later this year.   At no cost to physicians, WellPoint's initiative will offer participating doctors a wireless, handheld electronic prescribing unit, a wireless access point and a one-year subscription to an e-prescribing service, all of which will allow physicians to electronically generate prescriptions. . . Physicians will be able to write prescriptions that can be electronically transmitted to the pharmacy of their choice. Almost 19,000 contracting WellPoint network physicians in California, Georgia, Missouri and Wisconsin have been invited to participate in this program.   hopefully this system will work out well and diminish the already abhorent death rate due to medical error (according to  urlLink the agency for healthcare research and quality , approximately  urlLink 7,000 americans die  every year due to  medication  errors alone).    urlLink another post  from the medical informatics blog mentions the new 'national health information technology coordinator' position at the  urlLink department of health and human services , which has been filled by david brailer.  the  urlLink press release from the dhhs  goes on to talk about some recent steps taken to further the cause of emr, such as releasing the snomed ontology/taxonomy, standardizing on an some hl7 interoperability protocols, and accepting various other standards that will help to further the cause of portability and uniformity over national medical records.

       urlLink dongresin  has a nice snip about rush limbaugh's recent comments on the iraq prison situation:   First of all, it's been revealed that the sort of abuses that go on in every prison in existence also somehow goes on in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Now, not one motherfucker in Iraq has ever doubted this for a second, but thanks to some photos, we all have yet more proof of what a  urlLink slimy douchebag  Rush Limbaugh is. You'd think for someone so close to going to prison himself, he'd have a less caviler attitude about sexual humiliation and sodomy. Here's my pledge to you, reader of The Joint : if it turns out that Rush Limbaugh goes to prison, I will get myself incarcerated in that same prison just so you can be certain someone sodomizes him with plunger handle. Then, he can say firsthand and with some real knowledge how that's not really torture. I may also teabag him if I'm feeling jaunty that day. Hard to say. Prison is upsetting.

      Sorry I’m not writing about telegraph or torturing people or you know important stuff, but the only thing my life consists of is music, as I, as the name states, have no friends.  Anyway, I’m here to tell you about one of the most anticipated albums this year from the basement of West Coast rap.  I don’t know how much you know about the underground and I’m going to continue to assume that you all are ignorant fucks, so I guess the first thing is first.   urlLink MADLIB  – DJ like none other.  Samples things that I would have never imagined to sample before (ie: street fighter II and 80’s b movies).  His manner of producing/beat making/making love with my ear is beyond what I can really say in words.  I can just explain the way that it exists in space.  Like constellations, one looks upon this galaxy of sound to see how Madlib’s seemingly random notes to make a gorgeous image.  Normally we are the people bringing the stars into a picture, but this time, Madlib is the one showing up the beauty in his sound.  The sound is his galaxy and he brings all of it together so that when you listen to the deepest part of the sound you begin to believe the design argument of sound.  Not god…just sound.   urlLink QUASIMOTO  – The alter ego of Madlib.  Though I haven’t been in this game for long, this, in my opinion, is one of the most interesting DJ going MC I’ve seen.  Unlike most rapper, Quasi keeps his DJ abilities the focus as he takes his spoken word and ends up making it go through his equipment.  When you hear Quasi for the first time you are going to think one thing and one thing alone: Steve Urkel on helium.  This is because Madlib is too much of a DJ to use his voice at a regular speed and instead speeds it up to around 2x.   urlLink MF DOOM  – The biggest up and coming backpacking MC in the last couple of years.  Any of you who listened to the abstract hip hop movement often told by Kool Keith’s alter ego  urlLink DR. OCTAGON  – then you will be somewhat familiar with this breed of rapping.  Though Doc Oct was a bit out there when trying to rap about a time in the future that was decidedly overrun by perversion, MF Doom keeps it much more down to earth.  His call as Madvillain should be the Geek signal in the sky.  I mean seriously, who makes an album based on a failed comic book idea.  (For those of you who know not what I mean, check out this  urlLink pitchfork review of the album ).  The merger of these two brings nothing more than pure happiness to my heart.  Very few things entertain me more than following Mandy Moore for “ideas,” but sitting down and listening to the samples that seem to me shouldn’t exist or be coherent overlain with the rougher drum/bass line like voice of MF Doom just, for some reason, allows me to stop what I’m doing and just slip away in a world that feels like cell animated beats.  Enough of this though…here WERE the mp3’s, they are gone now.  Email me if you want some shizzzzzzit.  Enjoy and remember – I hate you.

      that's right!  right wing america has a  new sex symbol , and her name is lynndie england.   urlLink boingboing  points to some info on the prison torturette and future national review playmate in this  urlLink daily telegraph article .  i have no idea if the paper is reputable, but here are some gems:    She faces a court martial, but at home she is toasted as a hero.  At the dingy Corner Club Saloon they think she has done nothing wrong.  "A lot of people here think they ought to just blow up the whole of Iraq," Colleen Kesner said.   "We went there to help the jackasses and they started blowing us up. Lynndie didn't kill 'em, she didn't cut 'em up. She should have shot some of the suckers."   also, why aren't people making a big deal about the dude in the photos?  he's wearing light blue latex gloves in a room full of bent over naked men for god's sake!  i don't even want to know.  i think it's kinda fitting that this stuff comes out while the right wing america is bashing kerry for saying that atrocities occurred during vietnam.  i'm kinda pissed at kerry for backing away from that statement.  of course atrocities occurred during vietnam....i think the american public needs to be educated as to what exactly happens during war.

      Why did guards in Iraq treat iraqi prisoners the way they did?  It was unjustifiable under any circumstances.  Any the US admits it happens with Bush publicly apologizing several times:  urlLink [NYTimes]  including once on arabic television.  But one might ask why such things happen.    A 1971 Standford study regarding the psychology of prisons claims an answer:  urlLink [NYTimes]  or for the actual study see  urlLink [Stanford Prison Study] .  In such situations where unequal power dynamics are present, it seems people seem to become naturally violent.  Similar themes were touched on in Philip Gourevitch's book  urlLink [ We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda] .  In the end it seems that ordinary people are capable of horrible things and blurs the distinction between "normal" and "monster." But what really is "normal" anyway.  It seems it can only be defined by what it's not...

      via  urlLink boingboing :  this  urlLink telegraph article discusses research on intentional blindness :  a phenomenon characterized by not sensing something that is obviously there.  interesting stuff.  i read another article a while ago on the opposite phenomenon, where missing parts of scenes were inferred, such as people 'seeing' a normal picture of an airplane landing when in fact the picture had a part of the fuselage cropped out.  if you want to check your own puny brains out, follow the link at the bottom of the article to the  urlLink collection of videos used for testing this phenomenon .  have a friend read the purpose for each video and then have them show you the video -- providing you with any prompting if necessary.

       urlLink or as it now known, crossing the TacoBellSeagramsWalMart river :   For the first half of May, the small, rural community of Richland will be called "Mojito" . . . The Buena Vista Township Committee voted 5-0 on April 26 to authorize the new name after the rum maker Bacardi offered to give the township $5,000 for recreation projects such as new playground equipment in public parks.   so....for $120k per year, i can fucking rename a town.  a fucking town.  it costs more to get naming rights for a minor league ball park.  science.

      Is it any worse for a mosque to issue, via loudspeaker, the call to prayer 5 times daily than it is for a church to play its bells? Muslims near Detroit recently had a petition approved for exactly this:  urlLink [Detroit Mosque] .  On the other hand, it always amuses me when people talk about their "constitutional rights."  I doubt most people have read the constitution:    "My main objection is simple," she said. "I don't want to be told that Allah is the true and only God five times a day, 365 days a year. It's against my constitutional rights to have to listen to another religion evangelize in my ear."    and   "Everyone talks about their rights," Mr. Schultz said. "The rights of Christians have been stripped from them. Last week there were Muslims praying downstairs, in a public building. If Christians tried to do that, the A.C.L.U. would shut us down."   Well?

      google was gracious enough to invite active blogger users to beta test their new email service, gmail.  you've probably heard about it's content based ads or its 1gb of storage.  (fratocrates team, you should be able to get yours by going to  urlLink blogger's home page  and signing in.  the invite should appear above the sign-in box on the right side of the screen.)  it's a pretty cool product.  they've definitely upped the ante for web-mail UIs, and it might even surpass the UI of traditional thick clients -- although i am sure there will be mozilla/thunderbird extensions mimicking the nicer features.  to be honest though, i don't have enough email in my gmail account to really give it a good workout.  i have so many god damn email accounts at this point that it's pissing me off and i don't really feel like having to check another one for email.  perhaps i'll subscribe to a few mailing lists which might be a reasonable simulacrum of having a normally populated inbox.  (on a side note,  urlLink aol has opened up their email with imap , which ROCKS.  i hope hotmail and gmail follow suit.)  anyway, current beta testers get to invite two people to join gmail, and people are  urlLink buying/selling these invites on ebay .  last i checked, one was going for $60.  pretty insane.

      As much as I hate Michael Moore and his hijack, reductionist journalism, I do respect his rights to distribute his movies and I certainly respect his right to seethe.  However, our good friends at Disney don't seem to believe in the same.  They want to censor  urlLink [Michael Moore's New Movie] .  I can't wait to see how he reacts to this one.  The film is called Fahrenheit 911, does the wonderfully obvious job of linking Bush and the Saudi kings (I guess the general public should know about this), and is not being released more or less because it "harshly criticizes" Bush.  Amusingly, Mel Gibson's studio Icon Pictures backed out of producing this movie...  Oh well...

The dollar store sector accounts for $16 billion a year, larger than the recorded music industry.  6. Families earning $70,000 and above are the fastest-growing group of customers for dollar stores. Dollar stores are beginning to lose their dowdy image.  8. Wal-Mart, feeling the competitive heat, is experimenting with "dollar store" sub-sections in some of their superstores.

      this workshop (captured by c-span) on  urlLink progressive talk-radio and using the internet to reclaim democracy  was pretty interesting (link is to a RealMedia streaming video file, which c-span does not keep up indefinitely).  the first two guys are alright (tom athans of democracy radio and mark walsh, air america radio ceo), but the real interesting stuff starts at 55 minutes, when former dean campaign internet consultant and author of  urlLink the cluetrain manifesto  and  urlLink small pieces loosely joined  (i've read neither), david weinberger, starts lobbing grenades at the audience.  he drops this classic from times of yore to open his talk:   I'm an academic by training, so meeting people who are actually doing something in the world is always a treat for me.   torless, i'm sure you can empathize, especially after that zero/GEB "party" you went to.  he ends his speech by  screaming  the following at the normally staid c-span audience -- all of whom are by now ready to eat their own children if weinberger asks them to:   take your country back from the [political] campaigns!  take your country back from the [political] marketers!  they're turning you into a consumer:  they're thinking of democracy as a transaction that's completed in the booth, and that's not it! that's not why we care.   so take some time off from masturbating to  urlLink america's favorite cunt  and check it out.

      Every once in a while I find myself in a situation where I curse literary intellectualism.  At those moments I remember that catchword that people use to describe all the pompous and senseless ramblings of literary intellectuals, namely "postmodernism."   I found myself at a party and somehow ended up talking to a bunch of philosphers.  They became much more interested in me when the found out that I'm a mathematician.  Once of them then asked me "What is zero?  Zero is not a number."  I paused, looked at him and responded: "What?"  He then said, again very quickly, "zero is that thing that isn't equal to itself, so how can it be a number?"  Now, I don't mind sensible discussions of the philosophy or history of mathematics, but it bugs me when people, especially pompous philsophers, rattle of insensible statements that are nothing more than definitional issues.  In the end, it turned out that  urlLink [Heidegger]  had made some statement about "nothingness" and my erstwhile conversation partner had somehow arbitrarily substituted "zero" for "nothingness" and was trying to get, I believe anyway, some kind of mathematical statement about Heidegger.  I reiterate, how do I find myself in these situations.    Another gem of this conversation regards yet another participant: she was a child of two academics whose "mother's milk" was perhaps Kant.  When I said I had enjoyed Douglas Hofstadter's book  urlLink [Gödel, Escher, Bach] , I was greeted by the response: "I liked that book when I was fifteen." Yet another participant claimed that the book was "content free."  I asked both to clarify their opinions.  Our academic child responded, "it's just so triumphalist."  The other responded: "it's just prattle for nerds."  I was asked about what content was in the book.  My response was: "besides a statement of  urlLink [Gödel's thoeorem] ?"  Whatever the case it was a stunning display of pomposity...  In order to enact retribution, I'm going to list some of my favorite "postmodernism is nonsense" books.   Actually, in the hope of academic honesty, there's only one that I've read and I'll list that one.  Indeed, what a stifled and pathetic existence I live.   urlLink [Fashionable Nonsense]  - by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont.  And a very intelligent response by (mathematician) Michael Harris entitled:  urlLink [I Know What you Mean!.pdf] .

      to get an understanding of the comedy of errors that is my life, take a look at  urlLink this post on decling physician compensation .  FUCK.  while i was in college, undiligently studying computer science and biophysics, people in the real world were minting money in IT and biotech.  when i graduated, i stepped right into a really fun recession that forced me to work 80 hour weeks for partially subsidized diet coke and trail mix, while all my doctor friends were pouring out pellegrino for their homies that couldn't make it to the top tax bracket.  now, i'm applying to medical school right as a mini-boom in IT is heating up and doctors are getting squeezed.  FUCK!!!!!   Despite an overall national trend of rising income and general economic prosperity in the late 1990s, and first three years of the new century, physician net income from the practice of medicine declined markedly and their private office overhead as a percentage of revenue surged to an estimated 54%, a substantial rise from 36% in 1997, and more than twice the 1980 median of 25%. (1)  Between 1995 and 1999, with CPI inflation averaging 2.5%, the average United States’ Professional Technical worker income rose 3.5%. In comparison, the percent change in average income decreased by 5.0% for all physicians, 6.4% for Primary Care physicians and 4.0% for Specialists physicians.  In addition, there is an increasing and demoralizing disparity between provider workload and compensation. The American College of Physicians (ACP noted that between 1999 and 2000, physician income declined by 13.9%, while total hours worked underwent a 6.7% increase.   but s'okay mang!  i'm going into medicine for my niggas in the struggle!!    a bunch of other interesting figures in the post, check it out when you get a chance.

      neil versel has a great new blog on IT in healthcare,  urlLink clinicalit .  he posted about  urlLink medical errors  earlier this month, specifically in reference to this  urlLink parade magazine article  on the topic.  here are some snips from the magazine article:   According to a groundbreaking 1999 study by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences, as many as 98,000 patients die in the more than 5000 U.S. hospitals each year because of medical errors. Such mistakes are the  eighth leading cause of death in America —ahead of car accidents, AIDS and breast cancer—according to the IOM’s most conservative estimates. [...] Reasons for preventable hospital errors include poor communication among staff, overworked or minimally trained workers and a faulty system of checks and balances. “Starbucks has more procedures in place for catching errors than many hospitals have,” contends Dr. Clancy.  Another important factor is the shortage of nurses. According to the American Nurses Association, there will be a shortage of 139,000 registered nurses this year and 275,000 by 2010.  There is a direct relationship between the number of nurses, patient care and hospital errors. One study by Linda Aiken and the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing showed that the number of patients dying after common surgeries in hospitals jumps when there is more than the average 4:1 patient-nurse ratio. A 7% increase in deaths is tied to a 5:1 ratio, and a 31% increase results from an 8:1 ratio. [...] The type of hospital you’re in also matters. A study by Prof. Eric Thomas of the University of Texas revealed that patients in for-profit hospitals, government-owned minor teaching hospitals and all government-owned nonteaching hospitals are at least 1.6 times more likely to suffer “preventable adverse events” than those in nonprofit hospitals.  This suggests that bottom-line concerns may affect the quality of patient care.  [...] “Studies have demonstrated that  as much as 40 minutes per shift can be gained by using electronic charting ,” says Terri Price, a nurse in the hospital’s department of patient services. “That’s 40 minutes more that a nurse can spend with patients.” And more nursing care can lead to fewer errors.

      If you don't know, my summer &quot;research&quot; (aka free labor) job this summer involves a small science named neuroscience. Perhaps you've heard of it, perhaps not. Anyway, there is a theory that relates Delta Sleep (third cycle of sleep before it reverses on itself and goes to REM) to schizophrenia.  Apparently the less Delta Sleep someone gets, the worse the symptoms are...who knew? Anyway, I was looking some stuff up on the inter-web and discovered some  information  that I was unaware of:   Abnormalities of sleep quantity and sleep depth persist for months into recovery from alcohol dependence, and are more profound in African American alcoholics compared to Europe-American alcoholics. The decay of delta sleep in alcoholics is coupled with impairment in the regulation or plasticity of slow wave sleep.   But why the African Americans? What is it about their DNA that makes them different? I mean isn't it bad enough the people already sterotype them as "unhealthy" drinkers?  Another interesting point:   Psychoactive substances have acute and chronic effects on sleep architecture.  Several aspects of sleep are compromised in individuals taking these drugs, depending on the drug. Difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep as well as poor sleep quality are common in patients on opiates. In fact, heroin addicts seeking treatment often report sleep disturbances, notably insomnia, as precipitating causes of relapse.   Drug studies always have interested me, just what makes this interesting is that SLEEP is what makes people relapse. I wonder how many people took that into account during addiction studies?  So what does this all mean? Probably that I shouldn't stay up late doing whatever it is that I do late at night on the Internet and why all my friends who stay up late and wake up early always feel emotionally unbalanced. Now I really wish I didn't stay up so late at night when I was in grade school to watch TV, but alas, the foilies of youth.

      mike sippey blogs about how he wants to  urlLink receive/use/share information :   yet the more I think about this problem of information discovery, sharing, routing and group forming, the more it seems that we're headed to a deeper merger of the mail client, the browser and various and sundry publishing and content archiving systems.  I remain unconvinced that there would be anything better suited to this task than an email-like application that's well integrated with the browser. What we're talking about here is messaging: reading incoming messages (whether via email, RSS or whatever comes next), and writing outgoing messages: some to individual contacts, some to public spaces (like sippey.com or delicious), some to semi-private group spaces (on orkut or flickr or mailing lists), some to a personal archive, and some to one or more of those destinations (cc, anyone?).   a pretty interesting post, especially his categorization of information along the two axes of privacy and context (which i didn't snip).  i think the information appliance he describes is almost here.  between  urlLink haystack ,  urlLink gush ,  urlLink hello , and  urlLink bloglines  (via their email functionality), i think we have the components of such a system, but nothing completely integrated.  btw, haystack has a new tool, a  urlLink semantic web browser .  now if only we had a semantic web to browse.

      so i was checking my referrer logs the other day and i saw that someone came to the site via a  urlLink pubsub  link.  i guess the service has been around for a while, but i never knew about it.  anyway, it is basically a continously updated search with results provided over rss.  so you drop the rss feed into your  urlLink aggregator  and it's all gravy baby:  you're now subscribed to a service that lets you know when people start talking about a subject that interests you.  not only can you subscribe to feeds based on search words, but you can also track URI's, so it's a near-realtime  urlLink technorati .  they don't just do blogs either:  if star trek conventions are your thing, you can  urlLink track newsgroups , and if you're the type that jacks off to  urlLink maria bartiromo , you can get  urlLink SEC EDGAR   urlLink feeds .  if rss is too proletarian for you, you can  urlLink publish the feed  over the  urlLink jabber protocol (XMPP) , so you can get your data LEGITIMATELY PUSHED in real-time to you your lazy ass [read  urlLink this  and  urlLink this  too].  you still want more?  a fucking  urlLink REST interface , okay?  i don't even know what good that does, but it gives  urlLink carlos perez  a boner, so that's about as much street cred you can ask for in a technology.  ultimately, i think it's a pretty good way to combat the information overload that a lot of us are going through right now.  while it does drop even more to my already overflowing plate o' shit, the information presented seem more high-value to me.  more "blog for your buck" so to speak.   urlLink mike davidson discussed information overload  recently and prefers an agent-based solution.  pubsub is the first step towards such an information environment.  incidentally, davidson also points to  urlLink newsmap , which is a really cool use of  urlLink treemaps  providing a news-media zeitgeist.  (the newsmap site also has  urlLink the most beautiful 404's  i've ever seen, nudging past  urlLink france's ministry of culture's 404's ).  check  urlLink the hive group  if you want more treemap goodness).  so of course, the first pubsub feed i made was for  urlLink blowjobs , continuing my  urlLink long standing tradition .  unfortunately, most of the links were stupid and about  urlLink jeri ryan  or  urlLink bill clinton  or some other nonsense that i couldn't care less about.  but there was some GOLD my friends.  like  urlLink this lady  ( urlLink pic ) with a phd in pharmacology from the university of texas houston medical school that gave  urlLink blowjobs  for doing her favors like helping her move, guitar lessons, etc.  she also was a prostitute for charity.  her name's tracy, and she's one more data point in an ever-growing list of reasons why girls named tracy make my world go round.  girls named abby are my numero dos.

      via  urlLink adrants :  the nyt reports on  urlLink a nato ad campaign in bosnia  that they hope will lead to the capture of suspected war criminal  urlLink radovan karadzic :   The military alliance paid for a billboard advertising campaign to coincide with Radovan Karadzic's birthday last Saturday. He is the most wanted suspect, the former Bosnian Serb leader.   The advertisements offer him a free one-way plane ticket to The Hague,  the home of the United Nations war crimes tribunal. Advertising campaigns have been tried before, but without success.   i'm not sure if the 'free plane ticket offer' is meant to be "ha-ha funny" or "i-think-it's-time-to-blow-my-brains-out funny".  in either case, it looks like nato supreme allied commander europe  urlLink joseph ralston  is doing peyote again.  (i love how nato doesn't put an 'of' inbetween 'commander' and 'europe' in that title.  that's how hardcore nato is:  they want to kill your ass so badly that they don't even take the time for prepositions.)  but they better find karadzic soon, because they bought that ticket on priceline.com, and you can't change the dates on those things.   "I like to think of NATO as a military alliance and not a P.R. company," said Mirza Hajric, a Bosnian Muslim and a onetime adviser to the former Bosnian Muslim leader, Alija Izetbegovic.  "NATO has been here for over 3,000 days, and it has not succeeded in arresting a few war criminals. That seriously undermines its credibility."   mirza, mirza, mirza...why do you always have to be so  negative ?  why can't you focus on all the  good  things that nato has done?  like bombing the fuck out of your country?  you know what this ad campaign really needs?  you know what would give it some teeth?

       urlLink gawker  links to an  urlLink interview  with  urlLink the onion's  senior editor, carol kolb.  also, here's a  urlLink  'fresh air'  interview  with kolb and onion editor-in-chief robert siegel, but it's not as good.   The emails I like the best are the ones where someone believes The Onion is real, or someone doesn't really get a straight-faced or sarcastic article and soapboxes to us the very point that we were trying to convey with the article. The emails are really hilarious, actually. When we did this op-ed, "Mary Kate Is Dragging Ashley Down" and we got 800 emails in big pink letters protesting this. They were the best thing ever.  [...] HB: You've been involved with the publication since 1996, which I believe qualifies you as a "seasoned veteran" in the world of humor writing. Are there any tips or words of advice you can offer to all the budding satirists out there?  CK: Yeah, have a really awful childhood. Get fingered by your uncle when you're eight or something like that. No, I think that it helps to just write a lot. Try not to fall in love with your writing. Find some people that you think are funny and find out what they laugh at. But ignore the advice of everyone else. If you're trying to be funny, then make sure you complete that job. Don't let the "point" drag the piece down. Don't shy away from controversial topics, but be careful who ends up as the target of your joke. You know, there's no reason not to make a joke about homelessness or whatever, but making fun of a bum for stinking probably isn't the way to go. Well, unless the joke has funny wording. Ah, I don't know. Listen to me talk. What do I know?

      I just want to go on record now to state who I think will be the next big thing.  Much like how I thought that a young Natalie Portman in "The Professional" was going to be a very attractive women when she grows up, I feel the same about a one  urlLink Emma Watson .  She's the one who plays Hermione in the Harry Potter movies.  Mark my words, she will be very attractive when she grows up.  Just another thought from In the Crease.

      via  urlLink /. :       urlLink scott collins , one of the old timers at netscape and a current evangelist for  urlLink mozilla  does an  urlLink interview with ars technica .  he starts off by talking about microsoft:   It's not going to be that somebody else actually knows better, because Microsoft actually does have a pretty good idea of what one generalized virtual person wants. But I think in the new world it's not about one big program to solve everybody's needs, it's about a zillion tiny programs all stuck together. Stuck together one way for you, stuck together another way for me that do the right thing. I think people are becoming savvy enough where they don't want a general program, they want something customized, they want a software kit that does what they want. Maybe if you're a business, it's not that every employee has a software kit, but maybe you are willing to spend to have two IT guys take an existing software kit and make it exactly what your business needs.   i kinda don't agree with this one.  it's not that i think microsoft software's good, but as a user of  urlLink emacs , i prefer a monolithic program (of course, an infinitely scriptable one) over a bunch of smaller tools.  having a bunch of little tools is good, and i appreciate the unix "pipe" philosophy , but having systems built from small interlocking tools means that i have to actually learn how to use a bunch of different tools.  emacs lets you learn one thing, and then customize the hell out of it, which i really really appreciate.  both solutions have the same goal, creating a system tailored to individual usage patterns, but the emacs-way (so to speak) is better in my opinion.  in fact, i wish mozilla was more emacs like almost every day.  he then goes on to talk about mistakes netscape made:   Ars: You mention mistakes made by Microsoft. What do you feel are mistakes that Mozilla has made in the past?  One: There was a fundamental mistake made by Netscape management, twice, which cost us a release at the most inopportune time. I think we can attribute a great deal of our market share loss to this mistake that was pretty much based completely on lies from one executive, who has since left the company (and left very rich) and who was an impediment to everything that we did. [...] Two: We made a version of COM, called  urlLink XPCOM , a fundamental piece of every component of every part of the software. We took COM all the way down to the lowest levels of the system, and I think that XPCOM is a fantastic useful tool. We had great and important places to use it, but we used it too deeply, we allowed it to influence our memory model across the board, and there continue to be costs associated with that which I don't think we need to be paying. [...] Three: I was the head of the team that fought hard with Netscape management to get a system of XML to define the user interface. I named it the XML User Interface Language, or  urlLink XUL  (pronounced zool). David Hyatt is the primary implementer of it, and one of the ideas that we had is that we would have a cross-platform interface, but that you specify native controls with XUL. It turned out that specifying native controls with XUL was hard. They were limited, and hard to write, and we waited a long time. People kept telling us that Mozilla would never be good until we had the native controls, and we knew they were wrong, it is good without native controls, but boy, people really really want their native controls. And they really rewarded us when we gave them native controls. When we gave them things like Firefox, which looks native on the platforms that its on, and Camino, which is native in OS X. They thought it was fantastic.   We should have used native controls as soon as it was possible, despite of the fact that they're harder to write, because we ended up going that way anyway.    points 2 and 3 seem to be supporting evidence for  urlLink "worse is better" , which is dissapointing.  the first point just goes to show that management sucks, which is refreshing.  goes on to obliquely talk about software engineering methodologies and other crap:   Ars: Can you talk a bit about some of the lesser known Mozilla products, like the web tools? Bugzilla is used by a large number of high profile OSS projects, how come Mozilla.org isn't marketing these tools as much?   You could probably define the web tools as our primary product in a way . During the great migration away from AOL and Netscape, every engineer that ever worked there took with them  urlLink Bugzilla ,  urlLink Tinderbox , and the  urlLink others . . . Once you use Tinderbox, you cannot work on big software without it. You see people working on big software without Tinderbox and you say to them "You guys are idiots! How do you know if your tree builds?" and they always say "Oh, our tree never builds, we know when a guy comes around and tells us when our tree builds."  Something interesting about Netscape: when I first got there, the tree was broken all the time. Every once in a while there was a day where the tree would build, and you pulled on that day. Someone would yell out "The tree is green!" and you would do everything you could to merge your stuff, and then the tree would be broken again, and it would be broken forever. When we wised up and started writing these tools things started to change, and along the way we came up with these cultural and behavioral standards. For instance, when the Tinderbox shows "RED", you don't check in. You don't check in on red. And if you do check in on red, someone will be there to kick your ass, and that person is the sheriff, and they have a sheriff badge and everything. In Code Rush you see Tara walking around with that bat, that was mostly symbolic but her job was to kick ass.  Everybody who checked in since the last freeze is "on the hook," so when the tree burns, everyone who checked in code during that cycle is responsible for fixing the tree. Life got better when there were serious consequences and it got to the point where in the old days everyone just checked in whenever they wanted. In the new days, you would be ashamed to check in something that broke the tree. It would be a big deal when you broke the tree. I checked in stuff that broke the tree on two occasions and the same guy fixed my shit twice, and I went out and bought him a bottle of Shiraz because I was ashamed that I broke the frickin' tree and I was grateful that he fixed it.

      i have a dream, and that dream is to one day document every fucking food cart in philly.  every time you meet someone new in this city, they tell you about a cart that you haven't tried yet.  some carts seem magical, like the indian/mexican one over near penn that supposedly makes burritos with chana masala.  others (like that falafel cart over on 17th and chestnut), you see once and you forget where you saw it and you spend countless afternoons wandering around looking for that fucking cart until finally a year later you find it again randomly while trying to find that belgian cafe that makes the sugar waffles.  sadly, the day of my food cart blog will never come.  because i am a lazy shit, and documenting food carts would require me to elevate from the sofa.  and that's not happening.  on a related note, the philly inquirer has an article about  urlLink inflation hitting the cart vendors hard :   Operators of Center City's ubiquitous lunch carts have begun tacking on quarters and half-dollars to the price of Philadelphia's signature sandwiches. For years, the cart owners swallowed temporary swings in the wholesale cost of meat, cheese and processed foods - but now some fear that inflation is here to stay. [...] "I took a beating" when wholesale cheese prices nearly doubled on top of a 40-cent-a-pound hike in beef earlier this year, Tsoukalos said. "I jacked my prices up" 25 cents a sandwich last month, he said, and he is bracing for more. [...] The 300 licensed Center City food carts typically operate in groups associated with restaurants or commissaries, where they can store food and clean their equipment. Many are owned by Greek, Korean or African Americans, and they often hire recent immigrants from Pakistan, Russia or Cambodia who are willing to work standing for hours in extremes of heat and cold. [...] The American cheese Kotridis buys for hoagies and other sandwiches has zoomed from $28 for a 20-pound box last winter to between $48 and $53 recently. "And I buy 40 pounds a week," he said.

       urlLink do not date telugu girls :   Maoist rebels in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh have responded positively to last week's invitation by the state government for peace talks.  But the outlawed People's War Group (PWG) insisted that the government should first declare a ceasefire. [...] Our correspondent says ceasefire demands have often been made by the PWG, and the state government has frequently avoided replying to them.  The state home minister argues that a ceasefire is normally only declared in the case of a war between two sovereign countries.  Mr Reddy said that for all practical purposes there had been no fighting between the two sides for some time. [...] It is estimated that the Maoist insurgency and counter-violence by the police during the last 30 years has claimed more than 6,000 lives.      why the fuck is there an armed communist rebellion in a country that has multiple communist parties in their government?

      i know all you fools with televisions have probably already seen  urlLink larry bird's comments on race  ad nauseum, but this shit is  hilarious :   "The one thing that always bothered me when I played in the NBA was I really got irritated when they put a white guy on me," Bird said. "I still don't understand why. A white guy would come out (and) I would always ask him: 'What, do you have a problem with your coach? Did your coach do this to you?' And he'd go, 'No,' and I'd say, 'Come on, you got a white guy coming out here to guard me; you got no chance.' ... For some reason, that always bothered me when I was playing against a white guy.  "As far as playing, I didn't care who guarded me -- red, yellow, black," Bird added. "I just didn't want a white guy guarding me. Because it's disrespect to my game."   i literally did a spit-take that lasted 30 seconds when i read that.

      via  urlLink autopr0n , foreign policy magazine has this  urlLink "interview"  with your average american slob.  it was generated from survey data on various topics and then morphed into a conversational format.  the results paint a picture of a pretty much level headed average american (although that could be due to interpretive bias applied to the survey data by the piece's author):   FP: Do you think that seeing the United States overthrow Hussein has given the North Koreans pause?  JP: No, it probably made them more motivated than ever to build nukes. They're not stupid—they know the United States has never attacked a country with nuclear weapons.   FP: What do you think about some limited use of military force, such as bombing their nuclear facilities?  JP: I don't think so. Besides, I'm not sure we have the right to do that kind of thing.   FP: What about overthrowing their government?  JP: Definitely not.   FP: What do you think about how the United States has approached North Korea?  JP: We should take a more diplomatic route, rather than trying to intimidate them by implying we might attack. I mean, isn't their fear that we would attack them exactly what got them all riled up in the first place?  FP: What do you think about using food aid as a bargaining chip?  JP: Definitely.  Whatever it takes to get them to disarm.  And our pounds are overflowing anyway.  We could get Kim Jong Il's finger off the button of Armageddon, rid America of stray dogs, AND keep those dirty Koreans fed for YEARS.   okay, so the last exchange is by yours truly, but i am positive that's what the average american would say if asked.  fuck, that's what the above average american would probably say too.  the only eyebrow that i raised was during the discussion of civil liberties:   FP: Let's talk about the domestic front of the war on terrorism. How do you feel about the creation of the Department of Homeland Security?  JP: I guess it is doing a fine job, but I am not sure that putting all those efforts into a single agency really adds anything or if it just creates more bureaucracy.   FP: Shortly after the terrorist attacks, the U.S. Congress passed new legislation called the U.S.A. Patriot Act, which removes certain limitations on the government's ability to monitor and detain individuals. How well do you feel you understand that legislation?  JP: Not very well.   FP: Based on what you know, though, would you say that the Patriot Act is a good thing overall?  JP: Basically, yes.   FP: Do you think it is necessary for Americans to be ready to give up some of their civil liberties to more effectively fight terrorism?  JP: Right after September 11, I thought that maybe we did, but now I am more inclined to believe that we don't. I am certainly not ready to give the government a complete pass. Civil liberties are important to me, even if we are talking about terrorism.   FP: Do you think the government has gone too far in compromising civil liberties?  JP: No. But I am concerned that it might.   FP: Are you aware that U.S. citizens have been detained under suspicion of being involved in a terrorist group?  JP: Yes.   FP: In such cases, should these suspects have the right to an attorney?  JP: Definitely.   FP: And is it your impression that they do have such a right?  JP: Yes, of course. Don't they?

[...] "Unfortunately the bird that was due to be freed by the Public Security Minister, Ratnasiri Wickremanayake, was dead almost as soon as it was handed to him by a white gloved soldier," he said.

[...] At the same time, Penguin, a unit of Pearson Plc, released results of a poll in which 85 percent of women said a man could increase his chances of getting a date by talking about a favorite book.  By contrast, more than half the men polled said they believed that flattering a woman would suffice to impress her.   not unexpectedly, the same report goes on to say that reading blogs  DECREASE  your chances of getting laid to a value that asymptotically approaches negative infinity.

      since young torless is overseas at the moment, i will be forced to take his place and post the requisite amount of nyt drivel for the summer.  unfortunately for yinz, this one has to do with developing nations too (via  urlLink boingboing ).  but this time, it's about  urlLink outsourcing prayers :   American, as well as Canadian and European churches, are sending Mass intentions, or requests for services like those to remember deceased relatives and thanksgiving prayers, to clergy in India. [...] In Kerala's churches, memorial and thanksgiving prayers conducted for local residents are said for a donation of 40 rupees (90 cents), whereas a prayer request from the United States typically comes with $5, the Indian priests say. [...] But critics of the phenomenon said they were shocked that religious services were being sent offshore, or outsourced, a word normally used for clerical and other office jobs that migrate to countries with lower wages. [...] However, congregations in Kerala say the practice of ordering prayers is several decades old. "The church is not a business enterprise, and it is sad and pathetic to connect this practice to outsourcing software work to cheaper labor destinations," said the Rev. Vincent Kundukulam of St. Joseph Pontifical Seminary in Aluva, near Cochin. [...] The Rev. Paul Thelakkat, a Cochin-based spokesman for the Synod of Bishops of the Syro-Malabar Church, said, "The prayer is heartfelt, and every prayer is treated as the same whether it is paid for in dollars, euros or in rupees."   dude, i'm seriously going to start a religion one of these days.  it seems like a good racket.  wally and i have already discussed starting a cult where we worship robocop and nail disaffected chicks (incidentally, that's where the blog's tagline comes from), so it's only a short hopskipandajump from that to a  urlLink megachurch .

      another one via  urlLink boingboing :  here's  urlLink an interview  with  urlLink dj spooky :   IDEAS: "Rhythm Science" criticizes American culture for being both alienating and conservative.  MILLER: Young people today have grown up in an era of  multiplex consciousness , a media-saturated culture where  meaning is no longer tethered to the ground of its origins . So why isn't there a broad artistic movement focused on coping with the information vertigo we experience daily? Except for a few turntablists and software-swapping geeks, Americans are trapped in what I call a micro-niche mentality.  We lack any awareness of the big picture , we passively accept the status quo, we do nothing besides pressing PLAY. [...] most Americans are conditioned to be consumers -- we spend millions on the products of top-down corporate culture, we're hypnotized by reality television, we have no awareness of history. "Dj Spooky" is an art project intended to encourage people to understand the dynamics of the broadcast mentality, to  play with the culture instead of just pressing PLAY . I'd like Americans to become "actionary" instead of reactionary, to collect and exchange samples of our culture and use them to  create new forms, new styles, new ways of thinking .   dj spooky gave a talk at the  urlLink creative commons  launch party at the end of 2002 where he showed parts of his remix of birth of a nation, which is pretty good.  video of the event can be found  urlLink here  on  urlLink lisa rein's blog .

      subscribing to  urlLink the economist  is the bourgeois equivalent of hitting the long ball -- and  urlLink chicks dig the long ball .  the latest article to go yard is  urlLink this one  on applying the open-source model to the pharmaceutical field.  while in the crease is busy painting toe nails and circling 'problem areas' with his sharpie-clutching sorority sisters, i'm actually interested in doing something productive, e.g., lowering health care costs and passing the dutch to alan greenspan.  the article talks about distributing the cost/risk of pharma research by using the open-source model.   CAN goodwill, aggregated over the internet, produce good medicine? The current approach to drug discovery works up to a point, but it is far from perfect. It is costly to develop medicines and get regulatory approval. The patent system can foreclose new uses or enhancements by outside researchers. And there has to be a consumer willing (or able) to pay for the resulting drugs, in order to justify the cost of drug development. Pharmaceutical companies have  little incentive to develop treatments for diseases that particularly afflict the poor , for example, since the people who need such treatments most may not be able to afford them. [...] Open-source research could indeed, it seems, open up two areas in particular. The first is that of non-patentable compounds and drugs whose patents have expired. These receive very little attention from researchers, because there would be no way to protect (and so profit from) any discovery that was made about their effectiveness. To give an oft-quoted example,  if aspirin cured cancer, no company would bother to do the trials to prove it,  or go through the rigmarole of regulatory approval, since it could not patent the discovery. [...] The second area where open source might be able to help would be in developing treatments for diseases that afflict small numbers of people, such as Parkinson's disease, or are found mainly in poor countries, such as malaria. In such cases, there simply is not a large enough market of paying customers to justify the enormous expense of developing a new drug. America's  urlLink Orphan Drug   urlLink Act , which provides financial incentives to develop drugs for small numbers of patients, is one approach. [...] In a paper presented this week in San Francisco at  urlLink BIO 2004 , the Biotechnology Industry Organisation's annual conference,  urlLink Stephen Maurer ,  urlLink Arti Rai  and  urlLink Andrej Sali —two lawyers and a computational biologist, respectively—called for an open-source approach to invent drugs to fight tropical diseases. It would work like this: a website they call the Tropical Disease Initiative would allow biologists and chemists to volunteer their expertise on certain areas of a specific disease. They would examine and annotate shared databases, and perform experiments. The results would be fully transparent and discussed in chat rooms. [...]  urlLink Eric von Hippel , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, is investigating how secondary uses for drugs are discovered, with a view to harnessing doctors and patients to record data. Many medications are approved for one purpose, but are regularly prescribed for another, “off-label” use. In many instances, new uses for a drug are discovered only after it is on the market, when a sort of natural experimentation takes place. For instance, Botox was approved in America for treating eye-muscle disorders, and only later found to remove wrinkles. In Europe and America, as many as half of all drug prescriptions for certain diseases fall into this category. The drugs often do not go through the formal process for other uses because the cost of regulatory approval is so high. [...] Dr von Hippel's idea is to decentralise the process of obtaining data on the off-label use, by collaborating with volunteer doctors and patients. By defraying costs in this way, it might then be possible to obtain regulatory approval. It is, in effect, an open-source clinical trial. Because the drug has already been approved, it has passed first-phase tests for safety. These do not have to be repeated. Second and third-phase drug-approvals test for efficacy and side-effects—and these are the very areas where getting formal approval for off-label use is sensible. [...]  urlLink Peter Lansbury's ...research is examining the therapeutic effect of a thousand approved drugs, on which the patent has expired in most cases. [...] Dr Lansbury refers to the work as “not-for-profit drug discovery”, but he sees direct parallels with the open-source approach. For one thing, his group places much of its data in the public domain. Secondly, though the research is mainly happening among different research labs within the confines of Harvard at the moment, the goal is to involve other scientists around the world. Only through this sort of collaborative, distributed approach will treatments be found for these diseases, he says.   if you are interested in the concept of advancement through the distribution of risk & costs, i think you'll find this  urlLink mitworld   urlLink lecture by noam chomsky  interesting.   UPDATE:  here's a  urlLink pdf of the essay  the maurer  et al.  people wrote for the bio conference.  jhc

      I have a roommate.  We get along great.  We both would have no problem watching television all afternoon and/or evening; we both would rather sleep in than get up; and we both know that the bathroom needs cleaning, but neither of us do anything about it.  So now you know, we share a bathroom.  Taking a look into this bathroom, one would notice the plethora of bathroom related objects.  In the shower- bottles of shampoo, conditioners, Caress soap, body wash, Noxzema facial cream, shaving cream, and razors.  Around the sink- toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwash, a couple of hair styling products, facial astringent, skin lotion, and those facial strips to clean out your pores.  Now, one thing you need to know about my roommate...she's a woman.  So now you must be thinking to yourself that most of these products make sense - the Noxzema, the Caress, the hair products, the astringent.  There's also one more thing you need to know about my roommate...she doesn't use these things.  That's right, the pink soap, the Noxzema, the astringent, and the hair styling products are all mine.  I'm secure enough to admit it.  I mean, Caress doesn't dry out my skin, Noxzema just makes your face feel clean, the astringent is great to avoid razor burn, and the hair has to look good somehow.  For the record, I never bought the facial strips for cleaning out the pores.  Sadly, I have used them.  So I'm writing this for all the real men out there.  I support the men who can admit they use more facial and hair products than their female roommate.  It's time for the 21st century man to stand up and be counted.  It's hard work looking this good.  And if hair and facial products are the price to pay for good hair and clean pores, I have only one thing to say - "Do you take Visa?"  I, for one, am not afraid to make a stand.  This has been Jesus Henry Christos, and I use more products than my female roommate.

      do you know what the eu's anthem is?  beethoven's ode to joy.  what kind of shit is that?  also, there was less of a turnout in the 1999 eu elections than in the 2000 us presidential elections.  that's kinda sad.  both are from  urlLink this quiz on the eu  on bbc.  in australia, you are fined if you don't vote.  i think they should implement that policy in america as well.  of course, i've never voted once in my life, so i'm one to talk.  they also have  urlLink instant run-off  elections in australia, which we should totally do in america.

      Last night while laying in bed trying to fall asleep, I was listening to BBC World Service on the radio.  They ran a story about how some coastal city was dumping popcorn into the sea to simulate an oil spill.  I looked this up and found  urlLink an article  about it.  Now, this article may not be the same event the report was referring to, but close enough.  Interesting how something so simple, and environmentally safe (any uncollected "oil" will be eaten by the fish and birds), can be so useful.  The radio story talked about how the popcorn, after it absorbs water, begins to act much like oil does in water, ie how water currents and weather affect where the "oil" flows.  Unfortunately, attempts to simulate gasoline in car tanks using popcorn have failed; as have rice to simulate an electrical current, and shampoo to simulate cooking fuel.  Although, the combination of shampoo and conditioner have yet to be tested, but hold promise.

      i was talking to in the crease and he was bashing me for posting "dissertations".  well i would like to be the first to extend a big "fuck you" to our new blogging friend in the crease.  what kind of a name is that anyway?  it's gay porn, that's what it is.  it's not even a proper noun:  it's a prepositional phrase.  if in the crease has his way, the blog is going to in google's top ten hits for gay porn.  we're already in the top ten for:   rumspringa  pie 3.14 (note, people are mispelling pi  "pie" .  i weep for the future of our nation.)  and tanushree dutta's ass (fratocrates mission statement #24 is now fulfilled.)  today's lecture is on the projected economic grow of  urlLink Brazil ,  urlLink Russia ,  urlLink India , and  urlLink China  -- collectively referred to as the BRIC nations.  The BRIC nations really started to gain attention when dominic wilson and  urlLink roopa purushothaman  of  urlLink goldman sachs  published global economics paper #99  urlLink  "dreaming with brics:  the path to 2050"  (pdf) .  people have been getting hyped about this paper since october 2003 when it was first published because it predicts a dramatically different economic world.  we all know that the developing nations are...well, developing, but i don't think that any of us (in america) really realize the amount, speed, and capacity for growth in the region.  their paper tries to create a predictave framework to analyze those topics.  the results are summarized in the following bullet points culled from the beginning of their paper:    If things go right, in less than 40 years, the BRICs economies together could be larger than the G6 in US dollar terms.  By 2025 they could account for over half the size of the G6.  Currently [the BRICs] are worth less than 15% [of the size of the G6].  Of the current G6, only the US and Japan may be among the six largest economies in US dollar terms in 2050.  The list of the world’s ten largest economies may look quite different in 2050.  The largest economies in the world (by GDP) may no longer be the richest (by income per capita) , making strategic choices for firms more complex.  The relative importance of the BRICs as an engine of new demand growth and spending power  may shift more dramatically and quickly than expected . Higher growth in these economies could offset the impact of greying populations and slower growth in the advanced economies.  Rising incomes may also see these economies move through the ‘sweet spot’ of growth for different kinds of products, as local spending patterns change. This could be an  important determinant of demand and pricing patterns for a range of commodities.   while you guys are yawning, i am getting a boner over this.  the growth talked about in this paper is explosive at times, and if this pans out, it will be happening in our lifetimes -- with some movements happening in the blink of an eye.  can you imagine a world in which america isn't the dominant economic force (in terms of  urlLink gdp  at least)?  what will this mean for  urlLink american   urlLink hegemony ?  will it effect our moral imperative to help those less fortunate than us (important to note that americans will still be the  richest individuals , i.e., american will still have the highest gdp/capita)?  of course, the model relies upon certain changes in the policies and infrastructures of the BRIC nations.  the following are listed as the most important steps towards growing an economy:   A set of core factors -- macroeconomic stability, institutional capacity, openness and education -- can set the stage for growth. Robert Barro’s influential work on the determinants of growth found that growth is enhanced by higher schooling and life expectancy, lower fertility, lower government consumption, better maintenance of the rule of law, lower inflation and improvements in the terms of trade.   the report goes on to say that of all the BRIC nations, india has the most work to do with regards to improving its infrastructure and education system.  infact, the numbers suggest that india will have a pretty slow start out of the gate, and will not start to gain steam until the midway point.   urlLink recent export data  (a component of gdp) mirrors the sentiment (perhaps in spirit only, these are long term predictions after all...and i'm  not exactly  an economist.):   Export growth in 2003 in key developing countries, including Brazil, Russia, China and South Korea, has outdone India's 13.48 per cent rise registered during April-December.  While China tops the list with a growth of 32.8 per cent during January-October 2003 with exports valued at $333.7 billion, Russia's exports rose by 25.3 per cent in 2003 to $133.7 billion.  Similarly, Brazil posted a record $24.8 billion trade surplus last year on account of a 21 per cent surge in exports that helped pull the economy out of a slump.  Compare this with India's figures. According to commerce ministry's statistics, India is fourth among the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) group, with total exports during April-December valued at $42.4 billion. Exports surged by 42 per cent in December.   of course, there are those that view the report and its april '04 sister report, global economics paper #109  "India: Realizing BRICs Potential"  (if any of you have access to this report, can you forward it to me?) with  urlLink large grains of salt :   Ergo, India’s cost advantage will continue and India will also get a sizeable chunk of the US outsourcing pie. But at best, outsourcing from the US and other countries will account for 1.5 per cent of India’s labour force. This BRIC report has the standard comparison between India and China and highlights not only China’s head start on reforms, but also manufacturing as the locomotive for growth in China vis-a-vis India’s service sector. Whether service sector growth alone can propel India to the 8 per cent plus category is debatable. GS thinks such an alternative to manufacturing-led growth is possible.  However, even if possible, consider the following. “Growth in IT — and services overall — will not result in a massive shift in employment, as has happened in other economies. India’s services sector may provide some incremental job growth, but it will only be a drop in the bucket for the labor force. Services employment is expected to rise to 107 million by 2007 from 102 million currently, creating only 5 million new jobs. Employment in agriculture is expected to remain roughly stable at 190 million. Also, services tend to concentrate in urban centers, potentially exacerbating the differences in income and development between the rural and urban sectors”. Thus, we can’t really separate the reform agenda from the question of reforms for whom?   coincidentally, philadelphia was virtually indistinguishable from a third world nation today:  oppressive heat, perpetual construction on 18th around rittenhouse blocking the sidewalk on both sides, that gag-reflex-inducing stench coming from the giant hole in the ground around 17th and arch, and steam dissolving hundreds of years of destitute-produced urine eminating from sidewalk vents and winding its way into the old-growth rainforest that is your crotch.  by the way, i hope you've all been paying attention, because this will be on the quiz.

      Have you ever thought that your life is a movie, and God is the producer, and has run out of extras for your 'movie'.  What I mean is, you see the same person multiple times throughout your day, but in completely different situations.  Much like how "Law and Order" will use an actor in one episode, then in another episode, you'll see the same actor but instead of being an attorney, he's a crack dealer.  (Watch enough reruns on A&E an you'll see what I mean.)  Case in point.  One morning I was riding the shuttle to school.  As I sat in my seat waiting to leave, a girl sat in the seat in front of me.  A very attractive blood girl who was wearing a red flower print blouse, tight black pants, and a blue thong.  Not that I was trying to look, but as she bent over to sit down, her pants slid down and exposed her thong.  Kind of a nice way to start the day, actually.  Well, as the day progressed, I ended up eating lunch with a friend.  As we sat there waiting for our food, I began to tell him about blue thong girl.  As soon as I finished the story, a girl walks in with a friend and begins to fill out a work application.  Seeing her, I thought she looked very familiar.  And as soon as she sat down, there it was.  The blue thong.  Same girl, different situation.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  In any case, this was just another observation from In the Crease, reminding everyone, blue thongs are good food.

      i'm back, and the blog is going to be more diabolical than ever.  i hung out with the young torless this weekend and subjected him to the usual castigation for not posting his trademark nyt.com fueled diatribes.  he offered a well-worn litany of excuses, but i wasn't buying any of them.  who cares if he has to finish his dissertation on n-dimentional manifolds?  i'm calling 'bullshit' on you young torless.  so, i'm going to break the 3rd rule of blogging (thou shalt not blog on the weekend) to point you guys to a couple of articles from  urlLink the economist .  (incidentally, dj i have no friends broke the 1st rule of blogging when he told my parents that i have a blog.   et tu brute? ...now i'm checking my referrer logs like i have ocd and debating whether or not to point fratocrates.blogspot.com to cnn.com in my parents' hosts file.)  the first article has  urlLink to do with hamburgers , and i was shocked to find it in a publication that spells 'favorite', 'fav ou rite' and has 'letters to the editor' which bizarrely all begin with the salutation 'Sir'.  although, perhaps you are a responsible adult and have know about the economist's big mac index since its inception in 1986, but it's much more likely that you are a complete and miserable failure like myself:   HOW fast is the world economy growing? How important is China as an engine of growth? How much richer is the average person in America than in China? The answers to these huge questions depend crucially on how you convert the value of output in different countries into a common currency. Converting national GDPs into dollars at market exchange rates is misleading. Prices tend to be lower in poor economies, so a dollar of spending in China, say, is worth a lot more than a dollar in America. A better method is to use purchasing-power parities (PPP), which take account of price differences.  The theory of purchasing-power parity says that in the long run exchange rates should move towards rates that would equalise the prices of an identical basket of goods and services in any two countries. This is the thinking behind The Economist's Big Mac index. Invented in 1986 as a light-hearted guide to whether currencies are at their “correct” level, our “basket” is a McDonalds' Big Mac, which is produced locally in almost 120 countries. [...] The average price of a Big Mac in four American cities is $2.90 (including tax). The cheapest shown in the table is in the Philippines ($1.23), the most expensive in Switzerland ($4.90). In other words, the Philippine peso is the world's most undervalued currency, the Swiss franc its most overvalued.  [ED NOTE:  the table shown in the online version of the article has listed additional countries which change these results.  see below for more.  jhc]  [...] One big implication of lower prices is that converting a poor country's GDP into dollars at market exchange rates will significantly understate the true size of its economy and its living standards. If China's GDP is converted into dollars using the Big Mac PPP, it is almost two-and-a-half-times bigger than if converted at the market exchange rate. Meatier and more sophisticated estimates of PPP, such as those used by the IMF, suggest that the required adjustment is even bigger. [...]  Small wonder, then, that global economic rankings are dramatically transformed when they are done on a PPP basis rather than market exchange rates.  America remains number one, but China leaps from seventh place to second, accounting for 13% of world output. India jumps into fourth place ahead of Germany, and both Brazil and Russia are bigger than Canada. Similarly, market exchange rates also exaggerate inequality.  Using market rates, the average American is 33 times richer than the average Chinese; on a PPP basis, he is “only” seven times richer.  [...]  This helps to explain why  commodity prices in general and oil prices in particular have been surging, even though growth has been relatively subdued in the rich world  since 2000. Emerging economies are not only growing much faster than rich economies and are more intensive in their use of raw materials and energy, but they also account for a bigger chunk of global output if measured correctly. As Charles Dumas, an economist at Lombard Street Research, neatly puts it, even if a Chinese loaf is a quarter of the cost of a loaf in America, it uses the same amount of flour.   interesting stuff.  in case you were wondering and were too fucking lazy to click a fucking hyperlink, the country with the most OVER-valued currency according to the big mac index is kuwait, with a gaudy 153% currency-to-big-mac overvaluation (a big mac there costs $7.33). iceland is second with a 107% overvaluation ($6.01).  the most undervalued currency with regard to big mac purchasing power is morocco, undervalued by -91% ($0.26 ...  that's right, you can buy a big mac in morocco for  26 cents ). saudi arabia (-78% and $0.64) and the uae (-77%, $0.67) follow closely behind.   urlLink the second article  from the economist is about the conclusions of  urlLink the copenhagen consensus , which i blogged about  urlLink previously .  for those who don't know, the copenhagen consensus brought together a group of economists that debated over how to most effectively spend a hypothetical $50 billion for advancing humanitarian causes.  the number one use of money in their minds?  aids prevention:   With something close to unanimity, the panel put measures to restrict the spread of HIV/AIDS at the top of the ranking. The challenge paper on communicable diseases, by Anne Mills and Sam Shillcutt of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, having reviewed the literature, reckoned that a package of preventive measures costing some $27 billion (in purchasing-power-adjusted dollars) over eight years would prevent nearly 30m new infections (reducing expected infections from 45m over the period to 17m).   the copenhagen consensus' website goes on to claim that the expenditure of $27 billion would result in "benefits almost forty times as high" (~$1 trillion).  providing micro-nutrients, trade liberalization, and controlling malria round out the "very good" category of recommendations.  wondering what the cc says was the worst use of the money?  climate control (i.e., the kyoto protocol).  however, as stated in the article (and unbenounced to me when i first blogged about the cc), the prime mover of the endeavor was bjorn lomborg, the famously embattled author of  urlLink  "the skeptical environmentalist"  .  most people familiar with lomborg's work are now likely crying foul over the summit -- as  urlLink the disinfopedia certainly is :   Due to take place over May 24-28 2004 - with the support of The Economist magazine - it will take the form of a meeting of a selection of nine eminent, generally right-wing economists, all of whom are from wealthy, industrialised countries. These economists will consider a set of ten "challenge papers" on subjects such as education and climate change, and prioritise economic solutions to these problems. The ten challenge papers will be published as a collection by Cambridge University Press, which published the English language version of Lomborg's The Sceptical Environmentalist. [...] Since the conference was first announced, five of the seven board members of the EAI  [ed note: lomborg's environmental assessment institute]  have resigned: two for personal reasons, and three in protest at the conference, which they say goes far beyond the EAI's original remit by considering subjects such as financial instability, corrupt governance and infectious diseases. [3], [4]  The exercise has been strongly criticised by NGOs such as Oxfam for drawing attention away from the existing consensus built up over several years and codified in the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.  It has also attracted criticism for an approach which tries to define development goals without involving any representatives from developing countries.  Finally, it has been questioned if a panel of exclusively free-market thinkers, several of whom have published views sceptical of the Kyoto consensus, can produce what is supposedly a neutral output on the issue.    so is this anti-kyoto grandstanding by lomborg?  who the fuck knows.  on the whole though, i think that with $50b, dealing with aids and malnutrion have got to be the 1-2 punch.  but if any of you guys actually know anything about econ or the environment etc., drop some links in the comments for me to read up on when you get a chance.

      here's those articles i promised in the previous post:   urlLink vice mag takes insouciance to new levels  by examining west african civil war through the fashion statements proffered by west african mass murderers:   We have heard about illegal uranium purchases, rebel armies, warlords, drugs, diamonds and even slavery, but in the center of all this mayhem one question keeps popping up that no one can seem to answer: What are they wearing? [...] In the late 90s, Sierra Leone (considered by the UN to be the worst place to inhabit in the world) took “thug life” to a new level, and in so doing showed us what humongous pussies our rappers are. This isn’t a place where you get mugged for your $200 Jordans; it’s a country where you get shot in the head for your hand-me-down Notorious B.I.G. shirt so someone can use it as a uniform (in the B.I.G. Army—no joke). It’s a place that just capped off a ten-year civil war, establishing a tenuous peace that will probably last for only a few days. There’s just too many fucking armies for any kind of peace to last. [...]  If Sierra Leone’s soldiers can be said to be analogous to Bloomingdale’s shoppers (safe, proven fashions), then the warriors of next-door-neighbor Liberia are strictly Lower East Side boutique habitués (willing to take tasteful risks). The most notorious and fashion-daring Liberian faction was the Butt Naked Gang [Ed. note: This is not a joke. We know you don’t believe us but we swear to God this is serious], headed by the Vivienne Westwood of West Africa, Gen. Butt Naked. According to a phone call he says he received from Satan as a teenager [again, this is fucking TRUE], Butt and his boys would be invincible in battle so long as they fought nude. Understandably emboldened, the general and his followers waged a campaign of gruesome combat. Some chose the undeniably timeless look of birthday suit, fake Chuck Taylors, and rifle. Others went for more chaste ensembles of powdered wigs, purses, and floral dresses. It takes a real man to wear a blouse into combat, but as Butt Naked has said, “We were nude, fearless, drunk, and homicidal.” Today reformed, he pastors a congregation in Monrovia. Can we shoot the words “ooooooh kaaaye” out of a rocket launcher so our reaction can do this guy’s life justice?   not to be outdone,  urlLink slate has an entire article on the crossdressing-warrior phenomenon  in liberia.  again, the fact that people are getting dismembered with machettes takes a back seat to the fashion fashion statments of war criminals, but i guess none of this even matters since people are more interested in jessica simpson's itunes playlist anyway.      The cross-dressing "dual identity" isn't just a source of battlefield bravado, though. Cross-dressing has deep historical roots in West African rites-of-passage rituals involving "medicine men" who would recommend wearing masks, talismans, and bush attire as a means of obtaining mystical powers. Rebels dressed in gowns and wigs and adorned with bones, leaves, and other "forest culture" trappings are practicing a modern variation on this technique of using symbolic "clothing" to access sources of power far stronger than their own. And in common Liberian initiation rituals—which exist in memory throughout the country, if not always in practice—a boy's passage to adulthood is symbolically represented by the donning of female garb. He must first pass through a dangerous indeterminate zone between male and female identity before finally becoming a man. A soldier dressed in women's clothes—or Halloween masks, or shower caps, etc.—on the battlefield is essentially asserting that he's in a volatile in-between state. The message it sends to other soldiers is, "Don't mess with me, I'm dangerous."    urlLink jet city jimbo highlights his travel-log with a story from the ap wire  (presumably "out of africa: butt naked battalion" by tina susman).   "But the Butt Naked Battalion stood out, not just for its nudity but for its brutality and its apparent fearlessness. Blahyi says this was the result of a contract with the devil, sealed at the age of 11 when he was initiated into a satanic society that demanded regular human sacrifice and nudity on the battlefield to ensure protection from his enemies."  "He started out as an armed robber and killer - killing too many people to count, Blahyi says - and was recruited into the war in 1994 when Johnson asked him for help."  "'I agreed, because at that time they offered me a lot of money. Everything I did, I did on a commercial basis.' said Blahyi, speaking in the dingy, shabbily furnished second-floor apartment he shares with several other people in Monrovia."  "Blahyi said he was required to make a human sacrifice before battle. Usually it was a small child, someone whose fresh blood would satisfy the devil."  "'Sometimes I would enter under the water where the children were playing. I would dive under the water, grab one, carry him under and break his neck. Sometimes I'd cause accidents. Sometimes I'd just slaughter them,' he said in a matter-of-fact manner."   pretty crazy, right?   urlLink fielding's  'the world's most dangerous places'  has a nice historical look at the turmoil in liberia .  in addition, there's some content there about the preponderance of cruise ships with liberian registry.  as the site states:   Instead of freedom for all, Liberia became a free-for-all, reduced to primal clashes among rival clans, randomly slaughtering each other with old machine guns from the back of ancient, dented jeeps. Bands of marauders cut swaths across the rain forest plateau, donning Halloween masks and bolt-action rifles, as they rape and pillage in small villages before finally razing them. Calling the situation in modern Liberia a "civil war" is giving it too much status-crediting it with too much organization and purpose. The reality is villagers slaughtered by tribal-based militias that mark, like dogs pissing on a tree, their territory with the skulls of their victims. [...] Ever notice that small type that follows those cool cruise ads? It usually says Liberian Registry.  Yes, you read right, Liberia, the country without a postal system, phone network or even a government, sells a lot of flags and registrations. Over 1,600 ships totalling 59.8 million gross tons fly the Liberian flag. In fact, the $50 million in fees paid to the Liberian government comprises 90 percent of the revenue to the government in tough times.   don't think that this sort of rough-housing is limited to just western africa as well --  urlLink the secular web has an article about similar battle field antics in uganda :   No longer an Acholi boy but a man of forty years, Kony is the self-appointed successor to his aunt, Voodoo Priestess, "Alice Lakwena." (Lakwena is "messenger"in the Acholi tongue.) [3] It was this charismatic woman, the reputed channeler of a deceased, World War I Italian army officer, who led thousands of Acholi fighters to their deaths in one-sided battles with President Yoweri Museveni's military.[4] During the tribal revolt, from 1987 to 1988, Lakwena's ill-fated Holy Spirit Army tried to storm Uganda's capital city of Kampala, armed with sticks, stones, and voodoo toys. Alice promised her followers that stones thrown at the enemy would explode like grenades.[5] In the bloody battles that followed, with only a few rifles in their possession, the Holy Spirit Army was completely routed by heavy machine gun and artillery fire. [...] Not surprisingly, Mr. Kony had been tutored by his aunt, the Acholi Priestess, Lakwena, who herself had engaged in brutal kidnappings (forced conscriptions) into her Holy Spirit Army.[6] From the start, Joseph Kony exhibited a ruthlessness in war noted for an arrogant flaunting of the 1949 Geneva Convention. In one decade alone, over 8,000 children were kidnapped by the Lord's Resistance Army. Most of these unfortunate children are now presumed dead, killed either in combat or in the murderous crossfire of warring sides. Tragically, these prisoners of war are transported, tied in columns by rope as slaves, to LRA (Lord's Resistance Army) camps.[7] When shooting breaks out, the conscripts often are unable to escape. If the kidnapped children survive the long journey to the LRA camps, they are forcefully indoctrinated into the LRA's grand vision of an Acholi nation based on the Ten Commandments--savage beatings are meted out to all nonbelievers. The child captives are taught the rebel leader's belief in an apocalyptic arrival of "The Silent World." Joseph Kony believes there will be a time in history when all guns worldwide will fall silent and only those knowing how to use crude weapons, like stones, spears, and machetes, will prevail against their enemies.[8]   and if memory serves me correctly,  urlLink granta #62 also has an article  written by richard lloyd parry on indonesian tribal killings entitled  'what young men do' .  i can't find any excerpts online, and i would have to dig through some boxes to find my copy, so i'll try to pull out some interesting points from the essay after finals are over.

      ah, remember the amber hued days of youth coming up as a shorty in sierra leone...no?  perhaps this will refresh your memory:     yeah, that's a 10 year old with an AK.  i blame it on the rap music.  the picture comes from a  urlLink bbc article on forthcoming war-crimes trials  against those who recruited child-soldiers during sierra leone's civil war.  as the article states, this is kinda the way civil warriors get down in central africa.  i'll post some more on the comedy of gigantic proportions that is western african warfare when i get home today, but for now, i will provide you with this series of articles (parts  urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 , and  urlLink 3 )  on the liberian civil war by canadian journalist alexandre trudeau:   I try to remember the characters I knew here in 1997. Many of the politicians and fighters I interviewed then have fled or are dead. One of them, Jack the Rebel, was a heart-eating mass murderer: one of Taylor's top bad boys. In a strange way, he had been my friend. He wore aviator glasses, and had a raspy voice and the bloodshot eyes of a crack addict. He was illiterate, inarticulate and highly volatile. I would bring him liquor and he would talk about the mysteries of Africa. Beneath his burden of horrendous sin, there was something wise, even likeable about him. But now I learn that after I left, he was captured by LURD forces. They set him free in the bush -- but not before cutting off his arms and legs. Jack had it coming. He would have been the first to admit it. But I still feel a little saddened by this grim news. [...] In Tubmanburg, I encounter a young fighter who calls himself Bad Blood. He wears a rosary and is of the Kpelle tribe. His story is a common one. The fighters came into his village and ran amok, killing his parents and torching his house. When they finally moved on, he had no choice but to follow them. Bad Blood and most of his comrades-in-arms do not have homes or families anymore. The only culture they have in common is the wild culture of war.

      there's a great  urlLink interview  with  urlLink alan   urlLink moore  up on salon where he talks about war, police states, information, dystopia, and media (particularly television).   Moore clearly believes that the same mechanism has foisted a deadly, unwanted and unnecessary war upon the world. "Television and movies have short-circuited reality," he asserts. "I don't think a lot of people are entirely clear on what is real and what is on the screen." [...] The lesson there, as Moore explains it, is that to understand the world one lives in, one has to give "coherence to ... complexity, to say that it is possible to think about politics, history, mythology, architecture, murder and the rest of it all at the same time to see how it connects." [...] I find quite a few similarities between the fascist dystopia of your early work, "V for Vendetta," and our current political situation.  Well, the one thing with writing stories about the rise of fascism is that if you wait long enough, you'll almost certainly be proved right. Fascism is like a hydra -- you can cut off its head in the Germany of the '30s and '40s, but it'll still turn up on your back doorstep in a slightly altered guise. [...] ...My general thought is that yes, it's depressing, but not unexpected, when this stuff happens. And I do tend to think that, given the upsurge of the religious right over the last couple of decades, these are the last spasms of those dinosaur organisms.  Why do you think that?  Because they are standing in the way of history, trying to turn everything, politically and spiritually, back to a medieval vision of the world. Whereas they're perfectly entitled to have whatever worldview they like, I would suggest that humanity is moving in a forward direction. And that any attempt to turn the clock back to a mythical, simpler, or better age would probably be about as effective as Britain's ancient King Canute, who famously sat on his throne along the tide line and ordered the waves to go back. To be fair, he was only doing this to demonstrate the futility of expecting leaders and rulers to be able to command the forces of history and the world. But yeah, I tend to think that this conservative backlash that has been going on since the '70s is the final spasms of a dying creature; history is not moving that way, and no matter how much people dig their heels in and assume this is the 1950s or the Middle Ages, that's not the truth of the situation. No matter how powerful our political and religious leaders think they are, they are as dust before the immense and implacable forces of history and progress. I just hope that they don't make too much of a mess or take too many more people down with them.  One of the other similarities between "V for Vendetta" and our current situation is that the populace is cowed by fear, to an extent, through the media, whether it's television propaganda or electronic surveillance.  Of course. One of the reasons we singled out media in "V for Vendetta" was because it is one of the most useful tools of tyranny. We invite it into our own home every night; I'm sure that some of us think of it as a friend. That might be a horrifying notion but I'm sure there are people who think of television as perhaps one of their most intimate friends. And if the TV tells them that things in the world are a certain way, even if the evidence of their senses asserts it is not true, they'll probably believe the television set in the end. It's an alarming thought but we brought it upon ourselves. I mean, I think that television is one of the most diabolical -- in the very best sense of the word -- inventions of the past century. It has probably done more to degrade the mind and intelligence of its audience, even if they happen to be drug addicts or alcoholics; I would think that watching television has done more to limit their horizons in the long run. And it has also distorted our culture. [...] I feel that we may be approaching a cultural boiling point. I'm not saying this is a good thing or a bad thing; I really don't know because I can't imagine it, quite frankly. But I think we may be approaching the point at which the amount of information we are taking becomes exponential, and I'm not entirely certain what kind of human culture will exist beyond that point. Except it will happen sooner than we expect, and the difference between us and the kind of people that will exist after such an event will be vastly different than the difference between us and the hunter-gatherer society we've evolved from. [...] Yeah, it could be a quantum leap, a sudden, massive and unprecedented leap. Boiling point is a good analogy, because what you have before that stage is water. What you have after it is something that does not behave at all like water; it's a completely different substance altogether. And that's what I see looming for society -- and it's probably necessary, probably inevitable, probably scary. That's my prognosis. I suppose, as an artist, one of the obligations upon my work is to try and prepare people for the more complex world, to try and make it more palatable and accessible to them and not quite so frightening. That would seem to be a worthy goal, illuminating reality.   i haven't seen so much paranoia since  urlLink  gravity's rainbow  , but i think he makes a lot of valid points.  i found the discussion of "image" and "reality" especially interesting, especially in today's mediascape that features news as entertainment (e.g., fox news) and entertainment as news (e.g., daily show, michael moore, &c)....or should those examples be reversed?  does it mean anything that we contextualize real-life events through the lens of media ("it was like something out of a movie")?  on a related note, check out the description of  urlLink the free-speech zone at the dnc  in boston:    The maze of overhead netting, chain link fencing and razor wire couldn't be further in comfort from the high-tech confines of the arena stage where John Kerry is to accept the Democratic nomination for president during the four-day convention that kicks off Monday.  Abandoned, elevated rail lines and green girders loom over most of the official demonstration zone that slopes down to a subway station closed for the duration. To avoid hitting girders, tall protesters will have to duck at one end of the 28,000-square-foot zone. Train tracks obscure the line of sight to much of the FleetCenter. Concrete blocks were set around streets in the area, a transportation hub on the north side of downtown. [...]  U.S. District Judge Douglas P. Woodlock this past week called the conditions "an affront to free expression" and a "festering boil." He refused to order changes, but is letting protesters march past the site Sunday. A coalition of protesters appealed to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals

      the big brother sent me  urlLink this story on 'the man' using skunk stank  to ward off drug users in condemed buildings:   COLUMBIA, S.C. - Drug users and prostitutes are turning up their noses at the condemned buildings they once frequented in Richland County. Deputies here have begun using a chemical spray that makes the places smell like a skunk has come calling. [...]  "In the 11 places we've used it, it has been very successful," said Lott, who ordered 10 tubes of gel at $14.95 each in January. [...]  A growing number of law enforcement agencies across the country have turned to the product to ward off trespassers, said Duncan MacMorran, chief executive of Connovation, which manufactures and distributes the gel.  The Los Angeles County sheriff's department began using it 18 months ago, said Lt. Shaun Mathers. In the Compton area near Los Angeles, abandoned buildings had been a hot spot for people to hang out and drink until they got a whiff of Skunk Shot.   "There's nothing cool about sitting around drinking beer when it smells like a skunk," said Mathers, who sells the product to other agencies as a side job.   i bet you in 3 months, it actually  will  become cool to sit around and drink beer when it smells like skunk.  kids these days are so funny....especially when they are smoking crack and fucking prostitutes.

       urlLink marginal revolution  points to a  urlLink nyt's piece  about one mcdonald's franchiser's experience with outsourcing order taking:   PULL off Interstate 55 near Cape Girardeau, Mo., and into the drive-through lane of a McDonald's next to the highway and you'll get fast, friendly service, even though the person taking your order is not in the restaurant - or even in Missouri.  The order taker is in a call center in Colorado Springs, more than 900 miles away, connected to the customer and to the workers preparing the food by high-speed data lines. Even some restaurant jobs, it seems, are not immune to outsourcing.  The man who owns the Cape Girardeau restaurant, Shannon Y. Davis, has linked it and 3 other of his 12 McDonald's franchises to the Colorado call center, which is run by another McDonald's franchisee, Steven T. Bigari. And he did it for the same reasons that other business owners have embraced call centers: lower costs, greater speed and fewer mistakes. [...] In the fast-food business, time is truly money: shaving even five seconds off the processing time of an order is significant. Mr. Bigari said he had cut order time in his dual-lane drive-throughs by slightly more than 30 seconds, to about 1 minute, 5 seconds, on average. That's less than half the average of 2 minutes, 36 seconds, for all McDonald's, and among the fastest of any franchise in the country, according to QSRweb.com, which tracks such things. His drive-throughs now handle 260 cars an hour, Mr. Bigari said, 30 more than they did before he started the call center. [...] Though his operators earn, on average, 40 cents an hour more than his line employees, he has cut his overall labor costs by a percentage point, even as drive-through sales have increased. He said the call center saved enough in six months to cover the cost of setting it up, in part because he no longer had to employ as many people on the overnight shift. [...] Tests conducted by outside companies found that his drive-throughs now make mistakes on fewer than 2 percent of all orders, down from about 4 percent before he started using the call centers... [...] Mr. Bigari is so enthusiastic about the call-center idea that he has expanded it beyond the drive-through window at his seven restaurants that use the system. While he still offers counter service at those restaurants,  most customers now order through the call center, using phones with credit card readers on tables in the seating area.  Play areas at the restaurants have them, too, so a parent can place an order over the phone, pay with a credit card and have the food delivered.   marginal revolution goes on to call this "an interesting illustration of why a decentralized, capitalist system furthers innovation."  while i have nothing against decentralization or capitalism, i don't see how a franchise-based restaurant group (internally sharing many aspects of a command-driven economy) can be truly considered decentralized, nor do i see how this would be impossible under a socialist construct.  indeed, much of our nation's most innovative work is being done by the scientific community in a socialist manner, e.g., taxpayer money goes to nih, nih gives money to researchers, researchers produce innovations, innovations are used to further scientific research.  of course, patents have kind of corrupted this system, but it remains socialist in all the important aspects. for an interesting take on the distribution of risk and concentration of wealth going on in our scientific communities, take a look at  urlLink this lecture  by chomsky.

      from this philly inquirer  urlLink article  (is this a real publication?)    Of 2.2 million people living in the country, only about 900,000 are Kuwaiti citizens, and of these,  fewer than 130,000 males are eligible to vote . Most citizens have a well-paying government job -  more than 90 percent of Kuwaitis work in the public sector .  When they marry, couples receive a $13,000 gift from the government, plus a $230,000 no-interest loan to buy or build a house. Higher education, medical care and even electricity are free.  The government will pay tuition, housing, and "pocket money" for Kuwaitis who want to study abroad.  It's no surprise, then, that Kuwaitis live in big houses staffed by foreign servants, drive expensive foreign cars, and while away hours in shopping malls. [...] "Our education system has a problem: It's not graduating quality people," said Rola Dashti, an independent economic consultant in Kuwait City. "So you have youth with energy and expectations, and they do not have a career. They go to a government office from 8 to 2 and don't do anything. You're building frustration that can lead to instability."  Kuwait graduates aren't qualified for high-level private-sector jobs, she said, so they are relegated to make-work government posts - a recipe for low self-esteem. [...] "I don't think women should vote - we're too emotional," said Nouf al-Bannau, 26, an American-educated dentist who was sipping coffee in a shopping mall the other day, not wearing a head scarf.  "I can't believe it," exclaimed her friend Sharifah al-Falah, also 26 and American-educated. "You see - this is what's holding us back... . Of course we should have this right, and hopefully it will happen soon."

      why doesn't the alligator lobby want tax paying americans to know about  urlLink this ?   A man in the US state of Florida was arrested after he allegedly used his pet alligator to hit his girlfriend.  David Havenner, 41, faces misdemeanour charges of battery and possession of an alligator, said the authorities. [...] The three-foot (one metre) alligator, which had been kept in a bathtub, was handed to Florida wildlife officials.  "He threw [the alligator] at me," 39-year-old Ms Monico said on ABC News. "I don't think he knew what he was doing. He was just throwing it at me." [...] Mr Havenner's version of the story differed. According to the Associated Press, he told investigators Ms Monico bit his hand because she was upset they had run out of alcohol.   on a side note:  why is it a misdemeanor to have an alligator but it's legal to have an ar-15?

      Was shown  urlLink this  a whiles back on the yale message board.  It's actually from the Georgetown Lampoon.    Opinion Wearing Your Collar Down is for Poor People By I.M. Adick, III   When my ancestors came over to this great country 400 years ago, they had a vision for a utopia, free from minorities, liberals, poor people, homosexuals, and immigrants. There are few today who share such lofty ideals, but we're easy to find: Pastel polo shirts, loafers without socks, tucked-in shirts, but most importantly, collars up.   Call me a douchebag. Call me an arrogant little cocksucking dickhead. Beat the shit out of me if I'm not with fifteen of my B-frat friends (unlikely). But just know this: I interned at Smith Barney this summer. Where did you work? A Blockbuster? That's right you insignificant sack of dogshit; I'm going to be your boss. So take your t-shirt wearing, financial aid, blue-collar ass over to Blockbuster and get me a copy of Old School. Do you even own a tuxedo?  Look at my girlfriend. You think she'd go for someone who didn't have his collar up? I don't think so. I remember the night I met her. I bought her so many $9 drinks she couldn't even walk. So I drove her home in my BMW 328ci, but not before I took a few "liberties" with her. The next morning I took her to brunch and went to the mall, where I bought her some blouses. You assholes don't know the first thing about being a gentleman. You probably don't even know how to sail.   When I get out of business school, I'm going to be making $120,000 a year. Add that to my trust fund, and I can buy a country club membership, a ski house, and still have enough money to go barhopping around the city in my designer clothes and shit-eating grin. Maybe I'll offer you a hundred bucks to flip my collar up for me. I earned it you middle-class fuck up. I bet you went to public school.   You're so predictable. I bet I can guess your political party just by looking at you. My cronies and I range from elitist northern liberals to heartless conservative bastards. I've wasted enough time with you. Get some rich parents, an internship, and a pink polo with the collar up, and then maybe I'll let you hang out with me.   My favorite response to this post  is "when the collar pops, the panties drop."

      the national lampoon has some good  urlLink tips for fathers :   What was once "good old-fashioned discipline" is now "child abuse;" a term no doubt coined by an unmarried fruit college professor who will never find his telephoto lens in the toilet along with a box of Tampax and some ties. A few years back, if a father put a little too much pow in his punch and his kid got a shiner for it, it was too bad for the kid; he shouldn't have done whatever he did to make his dad punch him. Today, that father is in the clink, disgraced, discredited, and besieged by psychiatrists and case workers who will try to get the kid into a foster home where he can be abused by a foster father. The laws are on the books. Child abuse is a reality. We Christian-thinking, hard-working parents with firm backbones have no alternative but to try and beat the abuse laws. [...] 8. Undermine your child's credibility with teachers, clergy, family friends, and grandparents. Establish a reputation for them as "compulsive fibbers" and "storytellers." Make an appointment with their teachers to discuss their "wild imaginations." A visit to a child psychologist about the matter will put the subject on record for future use in legal situations.

       urlLink the telemedicine weblog  points to a group of buisnessweek articles on healthcare informatics.  one of them is about  urlLink the evanston northwestern healthcare system's move to EMR .  here's the skinny:   ...A 6,200 employee health-care provider with annual revenues of $1 billion and three hospitals and a research center in the Chicago suburbs, Evanston North is one of a small number of health-care institutions in the U.S. to go completely paperless. The $60 million project puts virtually ever process in the hospital online,  from purchase orders and prescriptions to scheduling surgical bays and transcribing medical records.  [...] The project took three years, finishing in late May.  All three hospitals and 50 affiliated doctors' offices are now paperless.  It's very early, but Neaman says the results are promising.  Doctors now receive patients' mammogram test results in a single day, compared to a three-week wait before. Errors in transcriptions and prescriptions have fallen significantly. And late administration of medication to patients has dropped by 70%.  [...] Before the big technology overhaul, Neaman's nurses spent one-third of their time reading and writing paper charts.  Now they spend less than half that time on electronic charts . According to Neaman, the organization could save $10 million per year. [...] Today, that future is still more vision than reality. Annual health-care spending in the U.S. will hit $1.8 trillion in 2004, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid.  But less than 5% of that will go into information technology -- far short of what's found in financial institutions and most other service-oriented industries.  [...] Worst of all, the soaring price tag for the creaky health-care system is growing far faster than the U.S. economy -- and becoming a potential drag on businesses burdened with rising costs. Over the past five years, annual health-care cost increases for U.S. employers averaged 11.5%, according to human resources consulting firm Hewitt Associates. In 2004, that's expected to hit 12.6%. [...] The majority of insurance companies and other entities on the financial side of the medical sector use advanced info tech to run their businesses. But its use inside doctors' offices, nursing homes, hospitals, and clinics remains shockingly low.  Basic economics explains some of the disparity. Hospitals and other health-care institutions lack the necessary capital to invest in costly IT overhauls. And efficiency gains from IT usage don't add to the providers' revenues. Rather, insurers capture those gains, because they benefit from less costly care and services per subscriber.  "The fundamental reason why health-care IT hasn't been adopted is there has been a misalignment of incentives,"  says Middleton.

      you might remember  urlLink nicholas carr's  article in the  urlLink harvard business review  entitled,  urlLink  'IT doesn't matter'  .  i don't, because i don't read hbr, but judging by  urlLink this wired essay , he basically says that i.t., like all industries before it, will become commoditized as a natural progression to maturity.  in the one marketing class that i took, commoditization was the ultimate dirty word, since commodities have smaller profit margins.  understandably, people involved in i.t. don't want to believe that their work will be commoditized, and for reasons that go beyond the economic conscerns.  such a large degree of creativity and insight go into the work, making us want to place our product at the same level as art, but really, commoditization is what OOP/SOA/components/frameworks are all about.  after all, much of our 'originality' is simply reinventing the wheel.  sometimes, as gaddis says in  urlLink  the recognitions  , "originality is a device that untalented people use to impress other untalented people, and protect themselves from talented people..." (pg. 252).  ironically, as silicon valley morphs into detroit, the gearheads over at gm are using i.t. heavily and in very flexible ways.  john battelle has  urlLink the text of an interview  he conducted with gm cto tony scott for business 2.0 over on his  urlLink searchblog :   You have a strategy that calls for  completely outsourcing your IT work.  Why?  It enables speed. If we want to go do something new and innovative in the IT space, all we have to do is put out an RFP. Then we hire the best minds to do it. We don't have to worry about an internal staff of programmers who may not have the right skill sets, or who have other demands and can't respond to what we need. Very few internal organizations can muster the sort of resources and global deployment capability that's needed to do what we need to do. Especially in cases where you need those resources for short periods of times. You can't build an internal staff in Argentina, say, for a six-week project.  So your IT organization is basically mostly management?  Yes. It's 1,700 or so people who manage the contracts with the outsource vendors all around the world.  And if you were to do it in-house?  Oh, it'd easily be  times 100 or more .  You've streamlined IT at headquarters. What's happening in the cars themselves?  Today in the typical car, and it doesn't matter whether it's a GM or a Honda (HMC),  electronics and software represent roughly about a third of the cost of the car, more than the labor or the steel. They're the single biggest cost in a car today -- and rising . The power train, for example, is very highly computerized. There's a set of very finely tuned algorithms to meet emission control and mileage standards.

      Ok, i'm sick and tired of hearing every fucking indie kid i know and critics rave about this fucking  urlLink franz ferdinand  album.  Really, it's not good.  Ok, there are a couple of songs that are decent, the songs where he actually tries to sing, but the rest of it when he doesn't just doesn't fit with the music.  He sings off beat.  Does that not bother anyone else?  Whatever, fuck everyone who is raving about this album.  I really did give it a fair chance, but it's not my style.  It's not composed enough, it seems like there wasn't a lot of though going on in it.  Not saying that there definitely wasn't any thought, it just feels so slopped together, even lo-fi sounds more put together than this.  Honestly, i must be missing something that all my other acquaintances get.  I highly don't recommend the Franz Ferdinand album as a whole, but a semi decent album with some good songs.

      i'm getting tired of having an opinion.  instead of arguing about shit from here on out, i'm just going to start dropping chronic plates on yo bitch ass.  that being said, you should check out some of the stuff going on at the  urlLink national constitution center  in philly.  in their  urlLink media archive , they have the videos of debates and talks on topics ranging from gay marriage, to presidential power, to whether or not john quincy adams was circumcised.  so far, i've only seen the gay marriage one, which was very interesting.  if you are an  urlLink npr  listener, you might recognize the national constitution center as the host for  urlLink the annenberg center's  show   urlLink "justice talking"   (get it, 'justice',  'just us'  talking?  those crazy shits on public radio kill me.)  justice talking is a forum where current events are discussed in the hope of extending discourse beyond the 7 second sound bites on television.  so far, i've listened to the ' urlLink abstinence only sex ed ', ' urlLink attacking aids ', and ' urlLink privitizing government ' episodes, all of which were excellent.  one thing i found striking during the 'abstinence only' and 'gay marriage' debates was the use of framing techniques ( urlLink previously blogged about ) by the right-wing debaters.  while the progressives would discuss facts, the reactionaries seemed to disregard those facts, instead trying to communicate an easily digestable (and often fearfull) vision by hammering the listener with carefully crafted and oft repeated phrases and imagery.  i think that to the average npr listener, this comes off as strawmanish at best and childish/misleading at worst, but when the debate is projected to a larger national audience during the elections, perhaps the democracts should also use such tactics....'perhaps" being the key word.  i'm still not sure if i can get behind a 'win at any costs' mentality.  jhc.

      if you've ever wished that you could access your bookmarks from any computer, then you should check out  urlLink del.icio.us , which is a web site that allows you to do exactly that (you can check out  urlLink my list of bookmarks here ).  in addition to simply bookmarking sites, you can categorize them with multiple tags, so links don't have to live in the strict hierarchy that browsers force you to use.   urlLink mike sippey points to a tool  that allows you to visualize the prominence of the semantic tags on your bookmarks ( urlLink here's the visualization of my del.icio.us page ).  btw, the visualization is not a server-rendered image:  it's all done with plain text and css positioning.  pretty slick.  unfortunately, i don't think that the distance between terms has any relation to their relationships though.

      we all saw  urlLink club du fisticuffs  and were all 'yeah bro!  let's totally rage against  urlLink ikea !!'.  but then we graduated from college & suddenly, it became a lot tougher to get blowjobs in an apartment furnished with boxes and folding metal chairs.  on top of that you got tetanus from an exposed nail in that bookshelf you bought for $5 from the guy named walter living across the hall, so you bit the bullet, bought a bookshelf from ikea, and said to yourself, 'well old bean, that wasn't as bad as brad pitt lead me to believe.'  now you know more swedish than alfred nobel and you jack off non-stop to  urlLink princess madeleine  (which is so necessary by the way, click and enjoy).   urlLink chris gielow  points to  urlLink this great guardian article  on the cultish nature of ikea (also,  urlLink part two of the article ):   From this modest background, for more than 60 years, Ikea has gradually locked Europe, north America, Australia, and now Russia and China in its insistent embrace. Beginning with a single store in Älmhult, the company now operates 186 outlets, employing 76,000 employees - though that word is uniformly rejected within Ikea in favour of the term "co-workers". It is frequently observed that, for a broad demographic swathe of Britain, Ikea has designed our lives; it is almost as frequently noted that its customer service sucks, that the traffic jams outside its stores are intolerable, and its assembly instructions indecipherable. We love it and hate it, rely on it and satirise it, often simultaneously -  as if it were not a shop at all, really, but something far more emotively substantial: a football team, or the Church of England, or the government.  [...] On some Sundays in Britain, according to one estimate, almost twice as many people visit a branch as attend church;  it has been calculated that 10% of Europeans currently alive were conceived in one of Ikea's beds . [...] The creepy sense that Ikea is something more than just an extremely successful capitalist enterprise - that to work for it is to work for some kind of cult, albeit a cult that worships untreated pine and Allen keys - doesn't take long to make itself felt in Älmhult. "When I came to Ikea, I felt like now I am a complete person," says Peter Keerberg, head of the workshop that produces the Ikea catalogue, his eyes shining..."We have an ambition to make a better life for the many people," he says, giving the strong impression that he really, really means it, but also that this is not necessarily a cause for comfort. [...] More than 130 million copies of the Ikea catalogue were printed and distributed last year, which is rather more than the Bible. [...] Over noodles at Ikea's staff restaurant, I ask one designer whether everyone at the company is really as energetic and hardworking as they seem. Isn't anyone lazy? "Of course there are lazy people," she says. "There are lazy people everywhere. But they're not..." She pauses, as if seeking the correct word in English. In fact, she's wondering whether what she is about to say will cause offence. "They're not Swedish," she says at last. [...] Ikea's moral crusade extends uncompromisingly to the customer. Whether you like it or not, it intends to teach you the value of good, honest, simple hard work. Self-assembly, viewed from this perspective, is more than a cost-cutting measure: it's a tool of evangelism, designed to make you sweat for your own edification..."Why should I clear my own table?" a sign in Ikea's British restaurants used to ask, in the tones of a surly child. The answer given underneath was about keeping costs down, but it was hard not to sense something more insistent and moralistic at work. "Ikea is somewhere that you can't go with both hands in your pockets," Nilsson says. "You have to be active." [...] ..."For bathrooms, it's Norwegian lakes. Kitchens are boys, and bedrooms are girls. For beds, it's Swedish cities. There's a lady who sits there and comes up with new names, making sure there isn't a name that means something really ugly in another language. But it doesn't always work. We gave a bed a name that means 'good lay' in German." [...] You did not, in other words, come into the store with a need that you wanted to satisfy: you came in, and then you got both your need and the means of satisfying it handed to you simultaneously. You came looking for a sofa, say, but you came out with a sofa and a trolleyfull of impulse buys. Theodor Adorno, the eminent German social theorist, called this "retroactive need" - and it was, he argued, a key means by which capitalism perpetuated itself, while shoring up the  illusion that what was being offered was individualised choice . He despised it: he thought it was a tool of subjugation and exploitation. [...] The high priests of modernist design preached a democratic ethos; in reality, they never got much further than the upper-middle classes. Kamprad took their rhetoric and made it literal, as the opening line of The Testament of a Furniture Dealer makes plain. "We have decided once and for all to side with the many," it reads. [...] This, you might expect, would mean that Ikea's profits on individual items would be tiny, and growing tinier - that it would make money only by the sheer number of tiny profits recouped daily. In fact,  its profit margins are huge . Between 17% and 18% of the price of the average Ikea product is pure profit, a figure so high that it leaves even seasoned experts such as Gotham awestruck. "It's phenomenal," he says. "Phenomenal." Many rival firms operate on single-figure margins; a lucrative supermarket chain such as Tesco is lucky to get 6%.   it seems ikea has out-mayhemed mr. durden.  regards, corporate jesus.

      The worst part about trying to write these things is having read review(s) of  the album making it hard to figure out what I actually am saying and what I have  already  urlLink read.   Anyway, it can't be helped now and I know that I will be repeating some of the  things already said in the review, but they are important to say, so I will repeat  it.  A Grand Don't Come for Free.   Though I can easily say that I wasn't a big fan of the first Streets album except  for the opening track, the sophomore attempt of Mike Skinner makes me feel much  better about the critical acclaim that he (the Streets) have been getting  Where I felt the first album had failed I feel the second album as remedied. The  first album to me was too choppy for my likes. Almost every track sounded the  same, just an English guy trying to choppily rap over beats that were just as  cut up (no pun intended) as his rapping style. The beauty of A Grand Don't come  for Free comes from the contrast that Skinner brings into this album. It seems  as if every odd numbered track reminds me of the first album while the even number  tracks show a different side of Skinner's ability as an artist. Through the music  in the back is essentially a backdrop to what is going on verbally (which is true  for most hip hop albums) the music of the album works like the overly surrealistic  scenery in a play on Dalì or the orchestral scores of  urlLink John  Williams  movie.  This allows for a story to be told without too much being taken away from the  story. The problem with a lot of movies nowadays is the lack of storyline. The  basis of a story is dialogue and not showy CGI, but for some reason along the  way, movie producers decided that it wasn't. In this way, Skinner tells of a story  of love and money both gained and lost without having to use a gimmick. What I  like about this album is the fact that it is a concept album and not an ethereal  concept such as a Radiohead album. Instead, it is like listening to a book on  tape with a beat. Overall, this album is deffinately worth the buy. I ended up  getting it for under $10 and it was well worth it.  urlLink Tracks   Here are two mp3s  urlLink Blinded by the lights  - What i failed to mention above is that the music is very down to earth.  This song is a good example of how easy it is to feel alone in a crowded place.  urlLink Dry your eyes  - Single handedly the greatest recreation of what it feels like when a girl you really like breaks up with you.  My favorite song of the moment.

       Thought it was only fair to tell you how &quot;people&quot; download music. I  know a lot of you use  urlLink Kazaa,   urlLink Limewire,   or  urlLink BTS  but they aren't really for music.  So what is, you ask?  urlLink Soulseek . When Audiogalaxy  shut down, it was disastrous for music lovers everywhere so they all migrated  to slsk where it is almost impossible to download anything BUT music. The interface  really isn't that confusing and it is pretty slow in all honesty, but when looking  for that hard to find album, this is where it is at.

      wow.  i'm not sure whether to be  urlLink proud or ashamed :   Mr Powell donned a hard hat and stuffed a hammer in his belt for the Village People's YMCA, a massive 1970s hit.  He was backed by five US officials, all imitating the gaily flamboyant outfits of the original band.  [...] "President Bush, he said to me, Colin I need you to run the department of state," the secretary of state to the tune of the original. "We are between a rock and a hard place." [...] Nor was it the first time Mr Powell has caused a sensation at the forum.  Three years ago, a skit in which he rolled around on the floor in a love duet with his then Japanese counterpart Wakiko Tanaka was universally panned, and prompted harsh words from his wife Alma.  A year later, he ran a video compilation of the world and his wife, literally, begging him not to sing again.

      the dude is seriously fucking turning into superman.   urlLink first   urlLink sudan , now  urlLink north korea .   His words were stark. "We're running out of time", he said, shortly before his meetings with Sudan's president and foreign minister.  "We need to see action promptly because people are dying and the death rates are going to go up significantly in the next several months. We've got to act now, not later. We can't talk. We have to see action."    I think he's shooting death rays at sudanese foreign minister mustafa osman ismail in these pictures:        "Unless we see more moves soon in all these areas, it may be necessary for the international community to begin considering other actions, to include Security Council action," Mr Powell said. [...] "We see indicators and elements that would start to move you toward a genocide conclusion but we're not there yet," Mr Powell said en route to Khartoum from Turkey.  "We can find the right label for it later, we have got to deal with it now."   Mr Annan has refused to use the term genocide, which would entail a legal obligation for the international community to take action.    so sudan:  focus up and get with the program, or we'll bomb the fuck out of you.

      according to  urlLink this smoking gun report , i'm basically the only person in america who hasn't nailed their hot blonde teacher.  the good stuff starts around page seven.   The 23-year-old Florida teacher is facing a host of felony charges for allegedly having sex with a 14-year-old male student. According to investigators, Lafave met the boy at Greco Middle School--where she taught reading--and had sex with him in her classroom, Isuzu SUV, and Tampa-area home. [...] According to the affidavit--portions of which were redacted by investigators--Lafave told the boy that she was "turned on by the fact that having sexual relations with him was not allowed."   so necessary.

      Since Jesus rarely leaves a 2 state radius of an unnamed state, I've decided to appoint myself our travelling correspondent:  I'll bitch about foreign countries to my heart's content.  Last week, I was rounding off a trip in Italy.  Italians make great food, but siesta is a real problem.  Even though I was spending most of my time on the beach, every once in a while I wanted to do something useful between the hours of one and four PM.  Sadly, all my efforts were thwarted:  everything was always shut.  Besides the laziness factor, things were pretty good.  Then I went to France.  I really don't like many things about France.  First, the keyboards are really screwed up.  I'm tired of the q being where the a is supposed to be.  An even worse problem is the racism.  Last summer I was in Paris and when I sat down on the subway next to old French women they would look at me and move away.  Terrible.  I thought it was just OLD French women that did this.  This year I learned that there are even YOUNG French women that do it at 9AM at the bus station.  Jesus I support you: the french are cowards.  Anyway, I go back to germany for most of the rest of the summer.  There I look forward to dealing with the arabic drug dealers in my neighborhood and the skinheads that live further east of me.  Sometimes I wonder why I leave the US.  But then I just remind myself of our wonderful president....

      doubtful.  what she does need is to eat a fucking sandwich.  read  urlLink this article  about the expected windfall in the sex industry when the republican convention rolls into nyc:   With thousands of Republicans set to invade the city this summer, high-priced escorts and strippers are preparing for one grand old party.  Agencies are flying in extra call girls from around the globe to meet the expected demand during the Aug. 30-Sept. 2 gathering at Madison Square Garden. [...] "We've got everything organized - the hotels, the flights, the advertisements," said another escort service operator. "We'll probably have 60 girls that week, instead of the usual 30."  Political conventions have long been a boon for the sex industry.  At the 1992 Democratic convention in New York, bikini-clad female oil wrestlers dropped their tops on a flatbed truck in front of Madison Square Garden.  At the 1996 Republican convention in San Diego, an escort service in search of delegate dollars changed its name to GOP: Good Old-Fashioned Pleasure.

      ah, i remember the moribund days of being a career man.  you probably didn't know this, but i used to be a strategic management consultant for mordechai consulting group in galilee from 20 AD - 24 AD.  those were four long years.  don't get me wrong though, it wasn't all bad.  actually, i was a full baller:  the pinstripe tunics made from the finest goat fur, the german donkey carts, you know how i get down.  i was pulling in a pretty respectable 300 sheckles a year, which was maybe below my market value -- being the son of god and all -- but it kept me laced up in butter-soft leathers and cristal.  but i always felt something was missing.  that certain  joi de vivre , as they say in canada.  those godless and deoderantless europeans got it right.  of course, there's been talk about the  urlLink relationship between religion  and  urlLink corporate buffoonery  since the days of  urlLink max weber , and  urlLink we hear about it today as well .     urlLink niall ferguson  restirrs the pot in  urlLink this opinion piece  for  urlLink the la times  (registration required):   Why is this? For one thing, Americans have much shorter vacations than Europeans. While German, Italian and French workers enjoy, on average, more than 40 days of vacation a year, the average American has to make do with just two weeks.  But this is only part of a growing transatlantic disparity in patterns of work.  There are, for example, many more Europeans out of work than Americans; over the last decade, U.S. unemployment has averaged 4.6%, compared with 9.2% for the European Union.  Then there is the familiar European penchant for strikes. Between 1992 and 2001, the Spanish economy lost, on average, 271 days per thousand employees as a result of industrial action. For Denmark, Italy, Finland, Ireland and France, the figures lay between 80 and 120. The figure for the United States was just 50. [...] In 1999, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average American in employment worked just under 2,000 hours a year (1,976). The average German worked just 1,535 — fully 22% less. According to a recent U.S. study, the average Frenchman works a staggering 32% less. [...] You see, the most remarkable thing about the transatlantic divergence in working patterns is that it has coincided almost exactly with a comparable divergence in religiosity, both in terms of observance and belief.  According to the Gallup Millennium Survey of religious attitudes (conducted in 1999), 48% of people in Western Europe nowadays almost never go to church; the figure for Eastern Europe is just a little lower at 44%. In the Netherlands, Britain, Germany, Sweden and Denmark, less than one in 10 of the population now attends church at least once a month. Only in Catholic Italy and Ireland does more than a third of the population worship once a month or more often.  By contrast, more than twice as many North Americans as Europeans attend religious services once a week or more.   personally, i think this argument is bunk.  if religiousness was indeed a contributing factor, then why is italy just two polio cases away from being considered a third-world country?  me, personally, i think that americans just don't know how to enjoy life.  in fact, i think that we are expressly forbidden from doing so by our politicians and media.  i mean,  urlLink kids have to be given orders to turn off nickelodeon...BY NICKELODEON !  and now researchers in the u.s.  urlLink found the genes responsible  for transforming monkeys from lazy dumb-fucks into shit-throwing workaholics.  i know at least two corporate types that had some stuff leak out of their pee-pees when they read that article, but why shouldn't they be excited?  it's only a matter of time before such modifications become  de rigueur  (that's french for "explosive diarrhea").  what advice can i give you?  none.  except for this:  are you sick of your job? then burn that bitch to the ground.  regards, motivational speaker jesus.

      I  urlLink couldn't have said it better myself . Keeping up my relatively new tradition of throwing shout outs to movies-in-release, I'd like to throw some love to Mikey Mann's new movie, 'Collateral'. You ever go to a movie completely blind, not knowing what to expect...at all? That was me tonight. I'd only seen one preview of this flick a while back and couldn't really recall anything. I  really  wanted to go see The Village, a la M Night Shamaladingdong, but my friends weren't up for it. To get to the point, the movie's shot beautifully, the characters are rich, and the story is pffffffat, i.e. it blows up like a big, wet fart. Really exceptional film making. The coolest aspect of all is that it just reeks of Mann's style. The story is totally incredible, but at the same time, suprisingly believable because it's occupied by characters that are similarly believable. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.

      figgured i should upload some music as of late. this band isn't anything new, but i figgure you guys haven't heard of them. it's kinda like indie electronica. they are doing an  urlLink american tour  from my understanding. Anyway, they have a very lush surrounding sound to them. When you listen to the mp3's, try to listen to them in order (birds, unrecorded, flowers) as birds is the intro and each track flows into one another. I hope you enjoy.   urlLink Birds   urlLink Unrecorded   urlLink Run into Flowers

      I can't believe that we spend money on teaching  urlLink gorillas how to sign .  And not only that, but how quick they got the doctors to give her a check up.  I mean, I'm still waiting the doctor to pull the endoscope out of my ass.  But, maybe I'm being too harsh.  The animal was in pain, and they took care of it.  And it is amazing that she is able to communicate so effectively with humans.  I guess she can sign to the patients sitting in the waiting rooms of the doctors who treated her why they can't get treatment today because of some hairy animal.  I can image one hand gesture that those patients can give her right back.  But image the hazing the doctors had to have received after returning to their hospitals.  Ahh, the American health system.  So quick to respond to a hairy beast while millions have no care.  Only in America.  By the way, the kitten in the picture must have been shitting itself after realizing it was face to face with a gorilla with better health care than most of America.

      mary k. letourneau is a  urlLink free woman  at last.  well, as free as any level 2 sex offender can be.   Letourneau, 42, pleaded guilty to raping Fualaau when he was 12. The case has spawned books, a made-for-TV movie and relentless media attention from around the world.   they forgot to mention "innumerable masturbatory fantasies" in that list.   As a Level 2 sex offender, Letourneau is considered likely to reoffend. She is living in a house south of Seattle near the airport, to be close to the two daughters she has with Fualaau and for the sake of convenience when her four other children visit from Alaska, a friend of Letourneau's said. [...] Letourneau was a 34-year-old elementary school teacher in Des Moines in an unhappy marriage when, in 1996, her friendship with 12-year-old Fualaau mutated into flirtation and then sex. Their passion raged out of control, Fualaau testified in a 2002 civil trial. "We had sex in the gym, we had sex in the girl's bathroom and we had sex in her classroom," he said in court.

      I thought this was an interesting article for several reasons, the highlights of which are: One, it lets me know that I'm not alone, and Two, it makes Japanese women seem less....attractive.  Read on, but for those of you will little time to waste, read on the following quote from the article :  urlLink   "Every healthy adult will expel from 1,000 to 2,000 milliliters of gas by farting every day. Each fart contains from about 50 to 500 milliliters, so it's normal to fart about 20 times a day. There's no fixed guidelines to say whether anybody is farting too much," says Daisuke Sasaki of the Hirosaki University Public Health Center. "Put it the other way, not farting at all would be unhealthy and a real problem."   urlLink http://mdn.mainichi.co.jp/waiwai/0408/0804flatulence.html  P.S. Hey, btw, can someone please show me how to linkthe above address in a phrase? It would be much more effective, I think, to link it to something like 'fart' or 'ass' or 'stink' but I don't have the technological wherewithal. Thank you , in advance!

      I find it ironic that these so-called  urlLink eco-tourists  were traveling on a gasoline powered boat. What fucking hypocrites! What's the matter, was their boat that runs on nice thoughts and self-righteousness in the shop?  It seems no one was hurt. Good thing too, because it would have been difficult for them to drive home in their SUV's if they were unable to shift on the fly into four-wheel drive to get over that speed bump in the parking lot.  But all's well that ends well, everybody's shirt collars stayed up. Except for one guy, whose collar was a little limp on the right side due to the ordeal. I heard it's being sent back to J. Crew for inspection. I just hope that the guy didn't remove the "Inspected by #'x'" sticker so it can be put on that Inspector's permanent record.  Unfortunately, cleaning up the mess proved to be a bit hectic. They were unable to predict the flow of the oil since the clean-up crew mistakenly trained using ping-pong balls instead of popcorn to simulate oil spills.

      Funny thing I heard the other day.  I was walking down to the subway in our fair city, which is much like the underground world in  Demolition Man  starring Sylvester Stallone and Dennis Rodman (aka Welsey Snipes), soundtrack by Sting, when I overheard a little girl ask her dad, "Why does it smell down here?"  I promply yelled out, "Because the bums piss here!" and proceeded to pee on her and her family.

      Here's one that I found from the blog at whatevs.org. You remember Vincent Gallo, the self-absorbed model/actor/musician/writer/director that made  Buffalo 66  back in 1999 with Christina Ricci. Well, he had made what has been called the 'worst movie of all time', worse even than Ishtar (which I actually liked). Now, apparently, he's on a one-man ride across the country to release it himself. I think we should all go, just because it's supposed to be horrible. Do we not celebrate 'excellence through mediocrity', after all?   urlLink http://www.brownbunny.net/   P.S. even the title of the movie sucks. It sounds like a nickname for diarrhea. WTF?

      not sure if this is funny or depressing, via a  urlLink post-gazette article  on troops in central asia, and that was via  urlLink john robb :   Manas Air Field near the capital of Kyrgyzstan now hosts more than 1,150 U.S. servicemen, the largest American military presence in Central Asia outside Afghanistan.  Yet "some of them still don't know where they are," joked Lt. Col. Stan Giles, the base chaplain. "You know, there's an old saying: 'War is God's way of teaching geography to Americans.'

       urlLink gross anatomy  has an interesting rant about  urlLink wal-mart's  healthcare practices.  basically, they don't have any.  via the  urlLink documents   urlLink linked to  in his post:   Employers who don't provide affordable coverage are abusing the system and their workers by passing the costs onto the taxpayers, other businesses and their workers.  Wal-Mart, the  largest private employer in the US  is also the largest abuser of the system.  High insurance premiums and deductibles keep more than  two-thirds  of Wal-Mart workers—that's nearly 700,000 workers—from participating in the Wal-Mart health plan. Traditional supermarket employees have about  80% coverage . [...] Wal-Mart’s actions shifts $1 billion onto the shoulders of other employers and taxpayers. [...] On a wage of $8.00 an hour with about 32 hours a week--$1,000 a month, most associates can’t afford even the low end range of Wal-Mart health insurance, $250 a month, or 25% of their gross income for Wal-Mart’s family health insurance. [...quotes below are from the second article...] A snapshot of Georgia's program for uninsured children shows that it's packed with kids of Wal-Mart  employees.  A state survey found 10,261 of the 166,000 children covered by Georgia's PeachCare for Kids health insurance in September 2002 had a parent working for Wal-Mart  Stores.  That's about 14 times the number for next highest employer: Publix, with 734. [...] The ratio of  Wal-Mart  employees' children per company worker in Georgia, though, greatly exceeds those of Publix and Shaw Industries and Mohawk Industries, the Nos. 3 and 4 employers on the PeachCare  list.     Wal-Mart,  with 42,000 workers in the state in 2002, had about  one child in the health care program for every four employees . The ratio for  Publix was one child in PeachCare  for every 22 employees . For Shaw, it was one for every 30 employees, and for Mohawk, one for every 26 workers. [...] About half of Wal-Mart's  U.S. workers are covered under the company medical plan, considered a low participation rate for large companies. But Fogleman said the total of employees with health insurance is 90 percent, because many get coverage through a spouse, a parent or a government program such as Medicare. [...] Wal-Mart  workers can buy individual coverage for as low as $15.25 every two weeks and family coverage for $66.25, Fogleman said. But those options have a deductible of $1,000, meaning that care is paid for by the employee until that ceiling is reached. Then Wal-Mart  covers 80 percent of further costs. Wal-Mart  says its average spending on medical benefits per employee is $3,100 per year. That's less than the industry average --- about $4,400 for large retailers --- as calculated by Mercer Human Resource Consulting. [...] The retail industry typically offers less-generous benefits and imposes longer exclusion periods than others, in part because of high employee turnover, noted Werner Gliebe of Segal Co., an employee benefits and human resources consulting firm.  Wal-Mart  employees pay about one-third of their health care premiums. That's typical of retailers and exceeds the 20 percent paid by an average Fortune 500 company worker, said Gliebe.  "You have a double whammy: People who are lower-paid having to contribute one-third of the cost," Gliebe said. Typically, as a result, fewer employees of retail companies enroll in their benefits plan, he added.   sometimes, wal-mart makes jesus angry.
