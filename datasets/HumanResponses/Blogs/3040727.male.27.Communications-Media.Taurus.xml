      Okay, this is the last week of character animation lessons that we have, after which we are given three weeks to produce a character animation short, and the tutor decides to tell us this little info....   You will expect to spend at least 10-15 hours for every 10 seconds of your animation project.  I think he expected us to be surprised or shocked, well... some people groaned and stuff, nothing too dramatic.  Honestly, to me, I have no idea if this is supposed to be a big deal or not... coz I have what some people might call a 'flexible' view of time, or otherwise known as 'rubber band time'. I am an idiot when it comes to gauging time. Hopeless. I see the 10-15 hours, and think; 'there is 24 hours in a day, so I can knock off about 20 seconds a day, and if I plan to do a minute's worth of animation, that's going to take just 3 days... and I have 3 weeks... so.... just what is the big deal?'   Have you ever had the feeling of being in an unavoidable disaster, like you are in a car and it suddenly loses control and it's going to crash? I get that feeling a lot....

      I read this in one of the Playstation magazines, and it is pure genius.... If you want a good exercise for your butt, use a DDR dancing mat to play a driving simulation game, like Gran Turismo. Just sit in the middle of the mat, and shift your butt left and right to control direction and use your legs to hit accelerate and brake.  If you don't own a Playstation, I recommend squats.

      Just randomly thinking about some stupid band names, here's some of them (in no order of merit)....  1. SCANDAL'US You get it? You get it? It's supposed to say 'Scandalous', wow, double meanings! That's so awesome.... I can imagine their producers having this meeting and someone says, "Alright guys, we've got ourselves a new pop band. We're not going to let them write their own songs, choreograph their own dance steps, pick out their own clothes or even drink whatever soft drink they want. But hey, why not let them make up their own name?"  2. BETCHADUPA They're actually a pretty decent New Zealand rock band, but their name really annoys me somehow. I keep thinking of some smart arse going around saying "You betcha, I'm super duper". And in the New Zealand accent it sounds like Bitchadupa.  3. EIFFEL 65 Wait, let me guess... you guys are from France.  Imagine a band called MERLION 84, or OPERA HOUSE 31.   4. BOYZVOICE Not a real band, but a made up one from this classic Boyband mockumentary from Sweden or Norway (I forget) called "Get Ready To Be Boyzvoiced", somewhat similar to "This is Spinal Tap". Pretty good film...  I like the part where they decided to put up a website for the band but Boyzvoice.com had already been taken by an obsessed fan, so the web guy that they hired took his own initiative and used BoyzBoyz.com instead, coz in their Scandinavian accent, they sound really similar. The manager got upset coz it sounds like a porn website.  5. BOYZONE Please refer above.  6. BACKSTREET BOYS There are just too many stupid boyband names out there. I bet if it weren't for copyright issues, they'd come up with a band called Boyz 'R Us.  7. FRENZAL RHOMB   That just doesn't make any sense. And not in a cool way like JUNO REACTOR, or APHEX TWIN, or SHONEN KNIFE, or SEPULTURA, or AND YOU WILL KNOW US BY THE TRAIL OF DEAD, or MY LIFE WITH THE THRILL KILL CULT, or FUGAZI, or MILLI VANILLI, or.... sorry got carried away. milli vanilli...?  8. OZOMATLI Well, another band whom I've got nothing against, but I just don't like the name. Maybe it means something in another language, I don't know... it could be a very meaningful name for all I know, or someone's name or something... well, uhm.... Okay, the real reason that I hate this name is because I made the mistake of watching this Drew Barrymore movie 'Never Been Kissed', and the supposedly cool high school kids in the movie were just way too lame. I mean, in one scene the 'Coolest guy in school' decided to make up a phrase and then declared to everyone to start using it. (C'mon, nobody really does that). And somehow, the whole school loves Ozomatli, (The way they say 'OZOMATLI' as if its the coolest band on earth, is pretty annoying, there is no such thing as the 'coolest band on earth', maybe except for Milli Vanilli...). And the band appeared in one scene in the movie where the kids are at this concert.... and.... this group of 'Cool' girls were.... dancing.... in synch. Synchronised DANCING! Since when is that a cool thing to do in a concert? (Except for in this other lame movie 'She's All That')   9. JAMIROQUAI The name comes from the combination of the words JAM, and IROQUAI, which I think is French or something for IROQUOIS, a Native American Indian tribe who started the whole mohawk hairstyle. I guess Jay Kay likes Native Americans, I bet he thinks about them when he's driving his million dollar cars.  10. BOWLING FOR SOUP That is too White Middle America sense of humour for me (one of the reasons I thought BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE would be a crap film, but I was wrong). Anyway, hate the name, and they are just another generic So-Cal Punk Band, which I generally don't think much of, except for RANCID and THE DISTILLERS. (Incidentally Brody Dalle from THE DISTILLERS used to be married to Tim Armstrong from RANCID).  11. LINKIN PARK Yeah dude, I'm too cool for school to be spelling things right and shit, you know..  too busy breaking it down, dropping those dope beats and whining about girls and shit.  12. AQUA If only they know what this means in certain contexts.  13. BEN LEE I'm sorry, I know he's not a band... I just don't like him.  There's tons more, but I've said enough for now...

      Last weekend, we attended this two-day design conference organised by the folks at DESIGN IS KINKY. It's basically two days of guest speakers from the international design community, talking about what they do and presenting us their showreels. It's been going on for a few years, and this is actually the first one we've ever attended. I wasn't that interested in it before, coz they usually only had Vector Illiustrators and Flash artists. But this year, they invited one of the guys from ILM, so I decided to check it out, and it turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise, we had a lot of fun. We each got a bag of free gifts for attending, which had really cool shit, like this awesome plastic designer bear toy like the ones made by Michael Lau, DIK stickers, a Semi Permanent commemorative book, a Diesel DVD rom with magnets.... and we got a free T-shirt at the end of the conference when they threw them out at the audience(They cost $50 each). Yeah, so it was quite a fruitful outing. And some of the speakers were quite interesting too... let's talk about some of them....   1. Phunk Studio This is a design firm consisting of four Singaporean guys who are making quite an impact internationally. I've seen them featured in idN and some other design magazines. They've collaborated with big names like 123Klan from France(They did a grafitti work on one of the skate ramps of the Skate Park next to Youth Centre) and they recently had their work exhibited in New York and Sydney.   It's nice to know that people can still succeed doing this kind of stuff in Singapore, kinda gives me a bit of optimism. Check out their work at  urlLink www.phunkstudio.com .   2. LOBO These guys are motion graphics artists from Brazil and they are fucking awesome... they're my new idols. Almost everything that you see done for MTV, VH1, and AXN are kind of inspired by the work that these guys have done, they are the originals. Have you seen that Junior Senior MTV where everything looked like an Atari game? Well LOBO did it already in 2000 for this other band Golden Shower, and then everyone wanted an Atari style video after that, but these guys refused to do another one, coz they never do anything similar, every work they do is original. Recently, they produced this promotional spot for the new Diesel collection called 'Lost Paradise', which is the most amzing thing I've seen. It incorporates almost every motion graphic technique known to man... 3D graphics, traditional hand drawn animation, flash animation, After Effects shit(I have no idea what the correct technical term for after effects shit is, sorry...) and they even made their own miniatures to use in stop motion animation. (I know all these because there was a kind of behind the scenes presentation of how they made the spot). And most of the music used for their work is also done in-house... they fucking do EVERYTHING!! All their work can be viewed on their website at  urlLink www.lobo.cx , you HAVE to check it out....  The guy who was representing LOBO was pretty cool in that he was making fun of MTV and VH1 the entire time, making them sound like dumb asses, especially when he talked about the dumb VH1 special BIG IN 2003, which they did the intro for. ("Basically it's about all the unimportant things that happened in that year, which they think is so important, you know like maybe, Cameron Diaz broke her nose or something...")   3. The Mill The Mill is a post production house based in England and New York and they've done work mostly for TV commercials. Have you seen the playstation2 ad where all these people rush together and form a huge mountain of people? They showed us how they did it, which was kind of neat. They also did music videos for The Darkness and they did that famous BBC TV spot where celebrities are singing the Lou Reed song 'Perfect Day'. The lady who was speaking for the Mill told us that by the end of that job, everyone got so sick of that song that they felt like shooting Lou Reed... especially when they had to do another one for Christmas. I'm hoping to get a job with them after I finish this course.   4.ILM And of course, there is Industrial Light and Magic... I was a bit disappointed coz they sent a conceptual artist instead of a 3D animator to represent them, but he still showed us some cool stuff. The guy who was speaking did the concept art for Van Helsing, and if you saw the artwork that was released a few months ago, prior to the release of the trailer, it was done by him. He also did concept art for Pirates of the Carribbean, and we found out that the texture for the dried out flesh of the ghost pirates was created by taking digital images of Turkey Jerky which one of the guys bought at a convenience store a few blocks away.   He also showed us some behind the scenes footage of AI, and it makes you appreciate the amount of work that gets put into for what may only be a fraction of a second on film. ILM still does a lot of miniature model work, and sadly, not all of them are preserved, a lot of them get junked after the film is finished.  Other stuff that we found out about ILM was that they do have a graphic design department, but there's only two guys in it, and that George Lucas is a down to earth average guy who buys takeaway from McDonalds.

      Here are 3 more movies that I recommend watching...  4. THE STORY OF RICKY (dir. Ngai Kai Lam) Anyone who thinks that Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is the worst movie ever made probably has not seen this ultimate cheesefest of a HongKong action film. This film is a classic... it is so bad that it is good, it makes PLAN 9 look like CITIZEN KANE.  The original Chinese title of the movie is LI WANG, 'LI' as in strength and 'WANG' as in king, which refers to the main character, Ricky... (he is, you see, the King of Strength). Ricky gets sent to prison and goes around fighting all the corrupt guys who run the prison, and that sums up the entire story... But the ultra violent scenes in the film have to be seen to be believed. I don't really remember all the specific details of every fight, but I just know that they were incredibly (and probably unintentionally) funny. For instance, one of the big bosses in the prison is losing a fight with Ricky, and in an act of desperation he pulls out a knife and stabs himself in the gut, spilling his intestines. Ricky, being the hero, rushes to save his life, thinking that he is trying to commit suicide... but you see, the bad guy was bluffing, and once Ricky gets near enough, he grabs his own intestines and strangles Ricky with them, and he lets out this evil laugh and says to Ricky "Ha ha... Ni Bei Pian Le..."(trans. "Haha... Sucker..."). I remember this scene so well as it has been burned forever in my brain due to its unbelievable stupidity and cheesiness. (One of Peter Jackson's earlier movies, BRAINDEAD, a zombie send-up, was a huge film-festival hit purely on the basis that it delivered entertaining cheesy violence and it was one of the first films I'd seen that used ultra violent scenes as comedic tools. This success was again replicated by the Spierig Brothers' first feature film THE UNDEAD... it's such a pity that THE STORY OF RICKY was not entered in any film-fests...)  This film is extremely hard to find, so if you happen to come across a VCD of this movie... BUY IT!!! Do not hesitate! Trust me, there is no other film like it.    5. PI (dir. Darren Aronofsky) Before I talk about this movie, let me talk about this tutor I had in my first year of Uni. This guy was way cool, coz he was different from all the other tutors who kept talking about informing your design thematic with a unifying philosophy. Most of them liked to refer to Heidegger and Barthes when explaining their architectural designs. But when I asked this guy what was his underlying thematic when he created his designs, instead of going on about how the interior spaces are a reflection of the language of human emotions which are a contradiction of the meaning of existence and the search for whatever crap some German guy went on about... he just said that the design was kind of influenced by cyber-punkish aesthetics... Okay, I may sound like an ignorant dumb ass here, but why can't design be that straightforward instead of having the need to relate it to what some dead guys said years ago? Isn't that just an exercise to make yourself appear more intelligent so that you can impress or put down people who have no idea what you are talking about?  Anyway, this tutor is quite a film buff (he does 3D animation work for short films as a sideline), and we talked a lot about all the movies that we liked. He recommended this movie, PI, about a mathematician who is on the verge of reducing chaos theory into a single formula, which has the potential to unlock the universal patterns found in nature and thus predict the future. Unavoidably, he becomes involved in a struggle for power between capitalists who want the formula to predict the stock market, and some rabbis who want to unlock the secrets of the Torah.(Apparently the Hebrew language is based on a numerological system) This movie came out around the same time as the first MATRIX, and we were discussing the similarities that they had in the opening sequences. Where the MATRIX had this screensaver thing with the green code that flooded the screen while PI flooded the screen with the value of pi, which goes on forever. When I compared these two movies together, I kind of realised how full of shit the MATRIX was, I mean, for the MATRIX opening sequence, they basically appropriated Katakana alphabets and fashioned them into this supposed new code that the MATRIX is built on. That's just trying to look cool without any substance, because they never explain how computer code evolved from a base number system into a pictorial alphabet system (which I think is quite impractical to use as code).  (I hope that doesn't sound too nerdy.)    The point is, PI doesn't go for cheap aesthetics like the MATRIX, which is just a movie about making cool looking scenes with 3D graphics.(Okay, some of you may say that I'm a hypocrite after what I said about architectural design being too weighed down with unnecessary philosophical ideas, but I think it's different when it comes to film, because films fall flat and fail to engage when there isn't enough substance, but buildings are not held together by notions and ideas)   This film is Darren Aronofsky's first feature and after this one he made REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, about drug addicts, which I also recommend. I'm a big fan of Darren now... it was disappointing to hear that he is no longer gonna do the BATMAN: YEAR ONE movie, that would definitely have kicked some serious ass.   6. LONE WOLF AND CUB - WHITE HEAVEN IN HELL (dir. Yoshiyuki Kuroda) This is the culminating movie in a series of six films made in the early seventies based on Kazuo Koike's smash hit samurai manga series, LONE WOLF AND CUB. These comics were translated and published in the US in the late eighties with the covers drawn by Frank Miller, who also wrote the introduction for every issue. I was a huge fan of these comics when I was in Primary School, and when I first heard that they made live action movies of them, with the screenplays written by Kazuo Koike himself, I almost shat myself. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I have a personal bias, it is a huge thrill for me to see the manga in live action.  LONE WOLF AND CUB is basically about Ogami Itto(the Lone wolf), a former executioner for the shogun, now a wandering samurai for hire, on a bloody journey to revenge. Accompanying him is his infant son, Daigoro(the cub), the last surviving member of his family who were killed by a rival clan of samurai, the Yagyus. The Yagyus had Ogami Itto framed in order to take over the much sought after job of the shogunate executioner. (This premise, in my opinion, was ripped off in ROAD TO PERDITION, also a movie based on a comic book about a Mafia Hitman who was framed and forced to go on the run as a gun for hire with his son, the last surviving member of his family.)  The series of six LONE WOLF movies (also known as the BABY CART series), had very similar storylines... Itto basically roams around, pushing his son in a baby cart and kills people for money. At the same time, he has to fend off assassins who are sent by the Yagyus. The fight scenes are terrific, especially when you see all the hidden weapons that have been engineered into the seemingly innocent baby cart... but the movies do get a bit repetitive once you've seen four or five of them. However, the last movie redeems the whole series as this one has the most incredible climactic fight scene I've ever seen in any movie... After killing off every single one of the assassins sent by the Yagyus, Itto now has to face the remaining members of the Yagyu clan, all 5000 of them. This showdown was shot on location at a breathtaking snow-covered mountainous region and the scene where 5000 extras charge down towards Itto and his baby cart is equally breathtaking(especially considering that no CG was used unlike the LORD OF THE RINGS and MATRIX RELOADED). Another thing that I liked about the movies is the casting of the role of Ogami Itto. In the comics, Itto is drawn as square jawed, handsome and heroic, but the guy who plays him in the movies is an overweight, middle aged man who looks a lot like Anthony Wong. This allows the character in the movies to shift between two personas effectively, one is that of an innocent looking father with his son, and the other is a ruthless warrior with cold, intense eyes.

      Here are some more renders of work that I've done for school....  This is from our first major project in which we were given three weeks to model, texture and light at least 3 rooms of a house, and produce at least 10 seconds of a walkthrough animation(they were pretty flexible, you could do anything as long as it is a building, but I like houses).   The designs are mainly cut and pasted from various magazines, so you may find them familiar if you read a lot of Architecture or Interior design mags, but I chose the home theater set up myself, which was pretty fun, browsing the catalogues as if you are buying them for real. The hardest part about producing architectural work is that you need to make the whole thing look convincingly real... this encompasses putting in insane amounts of detail in the models, using high-res texture maps and some advanced lighting technics, this all adds up to your rendering time, which is a bitch when you are making test renders to see how the whole thing looks.    Long render times also mean that you have to take into account the time required to render out your animation. In case you don't know, video for PAL contains 25 frames per second, so if you are doing that 10 seconds of the walkthrough animation, you will need to render 250 frames. The maximum render time that we are allowed per frame for this project was 10 minutes, so if you decide to be hardcore and go for the maximum, you will need to render for 2500 minutes, which is 41 hours.... (and for most of us, 10 seconds is hardly enough for a walkthrough)  Well by looking at the pictures below, you'd have an idea that I didn't really go hardcore... (you can check out some work on  urlLink CGtalk.com  for a real definition of hardcore) Instead of using advanced lighting tools like mental ray or radiosity, I faked it by putting in tons of omni lights and increasing the sample size of the shadows, which cuts down on rendering times but you take a risk of losing your sanity trying to coordinate and organize all your lights in the scene. Well, I rendered out 2000 frames which adds up to 80 seconds (I shouldn't have done so many rooms) and it took at least 2 minutes to render each frame, with some frames taking a maximum of 7 minutes.... I think I took about 4 days to render my stupid 80 seconds of that stupid piece of shit walkthrough....  Isn't 3D fun?             urlLink             urlLink                   urlLink             urlLink            Click on the pictures for a larger image

      I was planning to do a list of 13 movies that I like and say a bit about each... but there is so much stuff to say I couldn't do all 13, so I'll just do 3 at a time... Movies are fun and entertaining...  1. KAMIKAZE TAXI (dir. Masato Harada) This is my all time personal favourite movie of all time... uhm... all time...(the movie's so nice I said it twice... or thrice). I cannot stress enough how much I love this movie, it has all the ingredients of a great film in my opinion (violence + cheese + nudity + japanese = awesome go nuts). The story's about this young yakuza dude who betrays his gang, coz they killed his girlfriend, and he goes on the run, and meets this bad-ass Taxi driver who helps him fight off the yakuzas. Anyway, the plot is not the strongest element of the movie. Some reviews criticise the story as being too convoluted, and without focus as it tries to connect too many characters with complex backgrounds together. Well, if you are too used to the Hollywood formula of moviemaking (ie decide a specific genre for the movie and then use all conventions and cliches of that genre so as to give it 'focus' and 'identity'); you won't like this movie one bit. The movie's story thread does go off in different tangents occassionally, (it starts out as a documentary, then becomes a yakuza gangster movie, then becomes a road movie, and there are some glimpses of Discovery Channel...) but I think this is what makes the movie so interesting and unique. This kind of storytelling was used before in the movie TAMPOPO by Juzo Itami (and then somewhat ripped off in RUN LOLA RUN), where seemingly unrelated incidents appear in the middle of the movie, but it became one of the movie's greatest strengths, but I digress...   Anyway, the best element about KAMIKAZE TAXI are the characters, especially the titular character, who is sublimely acted by Koji Yakusho, who is a legend.(you know, that dude from Shall We Dance.. he's like the most famous Japanese actor who is not a pop idol) This Taxi driver is a bad ass(as I have mentioned), probably the most bad-ass character ever in a movie. I mean, check this out, as a child, he was transplanted from Japan to Peru when his dad(an ex WWII kamikaze pilot) got sick of Japanese society, and decided to migrate. He spent his childhood in the Peruvian Andes where he got involved with the rebel guerrillas, and killed lots of people, which is why he is able to take on the yakuzas. But the coolest thing about him is that he is humble and soft spoken, which I believe is lacking in most modern heroic personas. In one scene, a passenger in his taxi offends a vanful of Yakuzas, and he saves her life by discarding his pride and apologising to the yakuzas on her behalf, even though he can take them down to chinatown. How fucking cool is that? That is so Bruce Lee, like in the movie the Big Boss, where Bruce plays this guy who promised his dead parents or something that he won't kick ass, until he has no choice but to kick some ass. Well the Taxi driver does one better than Bruce, coz he isn't under any obligation to avoid conflict, he apologises through genuine humility and the concern for the welfare of the dumb ass passenger lady. The yakuza boss is quite cool too, coz although he's a violent psycho, it turns out that he's a big jazz fan and plays sax in an amateur band....      2. TRUE ROMANCE (dir. Tony Scott) The casting director of this movie is such a freakin' genius, he should rule the world. I mean, what other movie has Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Dennis Hopper, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt, Christopher Walken, Bronson Pinchot, Samuel L Jackson, Michael Rapaport, and James Gandolfini?(keep in mind that this film was made before a lot of these guys became a-list celebrities, so the casting was purely inspired, and not just getting whoever is the flavour of the month, unlike all those other hollywood movies with 'ensemble casts', ie Charlie's Angels 1+2, The Player, Short Cuts... etc). Anyway, the movie is okay, it has a good pedigree with a script written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Ridley Scott's brother Tony... but what I really love is this one scene where Gary Oldman appears as this tough gangster, Drexl Spivey. Drexl is the pimp to Patricia Arquette's character, Alabama, a prostitute. Christian Slater's character is in love with her, and in this scene, they are trying to negotiate for her freedom.   Gary Oldman only appears in this one scene in the film, but in my opinion, this scene is the peak of Gary Oldman's acting career, coz he has not been able to surpass it.(I've seen every single Gary Oldman movie as I became a big fan of him after watching this movie). Drexl Spivey is the third most bad ass character ever in a movie.(In case you're wondering, the second most bad ass character is the blonde guy from ICHI THE KILLER, directed by Takashi Miike)   3. SOME ULTRAMAN MOVIE SET IN THAILAND (I have no idea who directed this) I'm afraid I can't tell you the actual title of this film, coz I saw this when I was around ten years old, and there isn't a lot of specific details that I distinctively remember about it. Furthermore, I think it was in another language and had no subtitles... I'm not sure... What I remember vaguely is that one of the Ultraman appears briefly at the start of the film and he comes down to earth to save it from the alien monsters that is going to attack(I'm not even sure if it was Ultraman, it could have been one of the Ultraman clones like Megaloman or Spectreman)... Anyway, there's also this orphan who lives with this old guy who makes statues and there is this cool statue of a hindu-like god warrior that looks a bit like the Chinese ghostbuster Zhong Kui... and the statue gets possessed by the Ultraman who came down to earth.. which wasn't part of the plan coz he is supposed to possess a human (he must have been an intern or something). So the monsters attack and ultraman has no way of appearing coz he is stuck in the statue.. and the majority of the movie is about this kid doing something so that Ultraman can appear(exactly what this thing was I have no idea). Well the dramatic climax off this movie occurs when the statue turns out to have some magical powers and combined with Ultraman, it comes to life and grows to Ultraman size. So this cool hindu god-warrior fights off the monsters with his cool sword and I get all excited and think that this is the best movie ever made. (There is also a good chance that this movie never existed and that I just had a weird dream from watching too many Spectreman).

      I am such an idiot when it comes to web designing... I have just only now realised how to insert pictures with my blogs (actually, husky9 did, not me). Anyway, here is a render of the first complex 3D model that I did. It's the Eva Unit 01 from Neon Genesis... I can't tell you any more about it coz I have not watched the show, I just like the funky robots.   This model took me about three weeks to make (pretty slow for professional standards, they can model, rig, and skin these things in a week). It was box modelled with 3DS Max 6, using editable polys and rendered with light tracer. It has some flaws here and there in the mesh, which I will iron out when I have the time, and the texturing can be improved too. I can't wait to rig and animate it when I fully master character animation.  I don't think I am ready to post up any of my work for critique on those 3d forums like CG talk and 3d total, (it'll be ripped to shreds), so they will just be posted up here for the time being.

      No matter how long I stay here, I just can't get used to how inefficiently things are run here.... 'sigh'...  Last week, we went to the Department of Immigration, seeking to apply for permission to work on our student visas. The first thing we had to do was to take a queue number and wait our turn. The ticket dispensing machine only had two options, 'General Enquiries' and 'Appointments'. (Let me go off in a bit of a tangent here... isn't the point of having an appointment so that you come in at a pre-arranged time and not have to queue?) Anyway, we took our queue number and waited for our turn. It took around 45 minutes before our number was called, which was quite fast, coz we were there in the morning and the place wasn't too crowded. Okay, so far so good, we walked up to the counter and told the lady that we are applying for permission to work visas, and guess what happened....  She gave us another queue number and told us to go to level 1, where they actually process visa requests.  I realised then that I had to take a queue number to queue for a queue number... Well... I guess it's good for the economy... coz they are kind of employing people to give out queue numbers. (I know that if I ever get a job in Australia I'll never be replaced by a machine, coz they will still employ me to do the same job that the machine does. How great is that?)  Well, that wasn't too bad, I just lost 45 minutes of my life (which would otherwise have been spent pretending to do work in school, so it's not much of a loss). But... this other thing that happened with a parking ticket was just plain ridiculous. There was this parking ticket that we got last year in Oct, for parking the car 5 minutes over the allowed time. The penalty was $68, which I feel is a bit harsh for five minutes. So we wrote in a letter of appeal to get out of it... we never received a reply to that letter, so we kind of forgot about that issue, and we went back to Singapore for a friend's wedding for a couple of weeks. When I came back to Sydney, I received a penalty reminder notice in the mail for that ticket, and the deadline to pay had already passed. So I had no choice but to pay.   First I tried to pay through the internet, but I couldn't, as the infringement number was not on the system, so I called the 1300 number and it took me about a week of afternoons being put on hold, and hung up on before I finally got to speak to someone, who insisted that I could still pay through the internet, even though I told him I couldn't. So I tried the internet again, and guess what, I still couldn't pay! (Another payment option was to post a money order or cheque by mail to the Infringement Bureau. Yeah I could do that, but it would be easier to just take the $68 in cash and throw it out my balcony.) So what we did, we wrote another letter of appeal (I don't know why, but that kind of made sense to us at that time) And it kinda worked! We got a reply this time, telling us that our penalty has been put under the jurisdiction of the State Debt authority coz it was overdue, and because it was overdue, the penalty had gained interest and it is now $150. I received this news with mixed emotions, I was kinda pissed coz they could have informed us of this weeks ago, but on the other hand I was also happy coz I didn't have to deal with the Infringement Bureau again and I could finally pay off the penalty.  I guess I was too optimistic.  We called the State Debt Authority's 1300 number and the first thing that the operator asked was for was our Enforcement Number. We told him that we did not receive any Enforcement Number, and he told us that one will be sent to you in a couple of weeks. Okay, the fact that they had to send us this 'Enforcement Number' in a couple of weeks meant that there was no Enforcement Number for our case when we called, and without this 'Enforcement Number' we apparently can't pay the penalty. So the penalty was just collecting interest while we had no avenue to pay it through.   Now I know why there are so many 'free' parking spots in Sydney, they lure you in to park your cars, and before you know it they've got you in the system and you're paying $150 for parking your cars 5 minutes over the allowed time.  That's just not good enough, and this kind of inefficiency is entrenched in many aspects of the Australian public sector. It's alright if the most that happens is that an idiot like me gets inconvenienced once in a while, but unfortunately it's not. Considering that Australians pay 40% income tax on top of 10% GST and they also have to pay extremely high stamp duties when they buy a house... I think that a reasonable expectation is to have trains that run on time or at least run everyday for that matter, safer highways with lower death tolls, a public health system that can cope with all the patients; and public schools that do not have to close because the buildings have become health hazards. Instead we hear news that in most public hospitals air conditioning is considered a 'comfort' (State Parliament Building is air conditioned), and that a woman died after giving birth in Campbelltown Hospital due to inadequate post natal care (She was passed around between 7 doctors who did not bother to diagnose her)  And that millions of tax dollars are to be used to fund rich, private schools instead of helping out public schools that are struggling (The treasurer justified this funding by stating that he believes private schools teach better values and that public schools are too political).  What a freaking mess...

      A bit about this college that I go to...  1. My Head of Department wears Heelies. (No, he's not a child genius, he's a grown man)  2. We have class every weekday, but tuesdays and thursdays are for 'workshops'. (Otherwise known as Unreal Tournament practice.)  3. We can use a workshop day to go see a movie that is sanctioned by the college. (For example, Kill Bill 2, Shrek 2, Aliens V Predator, Hellboy.... This week was Scooby Doo 2.... I chose to go for workshop instead.)  4. If your mobile phone goes off during class, you have to sing 'I'm a little teapot' (with actions), in front of the class, while the tutor takes pictures with a digital camera and posts them up on the school forum.  5. They like to mess with you when you are taking your photo for the student ID's...  While I was taking mine, a tutor suddenly entered the room and shouted "Don't think about monkeys!". (And the guy who was taking my photo didn't tell me that he had already taken it, so I was left standing with my best photo face for 3 minutes while he did other stuff.)  6. The reason that I finally got on the internet chat thing - MSN messenger is installed on every PC.  7. On friday afternoons, a classroom is reserved for LAN gaming. (I'm serious... they have priority... people who are doing work in class get kicked out.)  8. I have learnt more about 3ds max in 2 months than the 4 semesters of 3d Vizualisation I took in Uni.   9. Throughout my course, I will only have to take 5 tests.... And one of them is a typing test. (I found out that I can type 45 words a min)  10. The school's internal web site has a splash page with a picture of Andre the Giant.  11. They like to play paint ball a lot.  12. We had to take a traditional animation module before starting 3D lessons, and this module was taught by a guy who used to work for Disney... The main thing that I learnt from that module is that I have not watched a disney cartoon (except for Lilo and Stitch and Pixar) since Snow White (which was ages ago). I prefer Japanime. (I remember my childhood being spent watching cheesy and violent Japanese cartoons such as God Sigma, Kamen Rider, Spectreman, Megaloman, Mazinger....)  13. There is this guy who likes Harry Potter waaaay too much...

      My character animation project is finally in the can and handed in... well that was actually a week ago, I'm now busy with another project that they've given us. This time it's a group project and we are put into groups of two (later on we will be in groups of three, then four). The main purpose of these group assignments is to kinda train us to work in an actual project environment. We get marks deducted if we have 'bad group dynamics', which is kinda vague... but essentially we have to get along, and not argue. (I wonder if we get extra marks if we have group t-shirts printed and we have our own theme song). So this time I have to be realy on the ball, no slacking, and I can't skp any classes, coz that gets marks deducted too. which means that I'm still surviving on less than 4 hours sleep everyday, so not much time to put in blog entries. The only break that I got recently was when I used one of my workshop days to watch Van Helsing. The movie was pretty ordinary, but it really saved my life, coz the tutor decided later on that if you watched Van Helsing on your workshop day, you are allowed to hand in your character animation project a day late.   My character animation project, as I have mentioned in a previous blog entry, is basically just this skater looking guy who doesn't skate but juggles a soccer ball like Ronaldinho in those cool nike freestyle soccer ads. You can see that I took a lot of shortcuts when I modelled him. I covered his head with a beanie so I didn't have to do complicated hair, and I made him topless, coz if I put on a t-shirt or a jumper on him, I'd have to animate all the secondary action when he moves around... well nuts to that. The animation didn't turn out as realistic as I had hoped, it still looks a bit too robotic. I guess I need a bit more experience to get all the timing and body dynamics just perfect. I was also too ambitious in trying to animate a realistic looking person, while everyone else were doing cartoon characters, which are easier to animate coz you can use exaggerated movements and caricatured body dynamics. When I have enough time, I'll try again at animating him...

      Hi there, long time no see...  I've been a bit too busy lately to write any crap on my blog, but I just thought I should drop in and just write about what's been going on in case they shut down my blog due to lack of use or something...  Well, the good news is that the submission for my character animation project has been extended another week, so that gives me just enough time to actually do some animation, but the bad news is that they've given us another project on top of that which is also due this week. This other project is to design and model a realtime game character for Quake III, initially, they were supposed to give us Neverwinter Nights, but nobody really likes Dungeons and Dragons in my class, (me included) so we voted for Quake. We also had to choose a theme for the class and everyone has to model a character based on that theme. We chose retro game characters and I'm going to model one of the girls from Metal Slug. (I wanted to do Pacman but the tutor said no) Also, one of the conditions for the theme is that you can't choose a retro character that has already been updated in 3D, coz they want you to show a bit of creativity in translating one medium into another, fair enough. So that means that Mario is out, Street Fighter is out, Zelda is out, and so is Shinobi, Castlevania, Super Contra etc. So many characters have been rehashed for PS2 and Xbox, what a bummer.   So that's realtime... it won't take as long as character animation coz realtime game models have to be low poly, so simple jagged meshes are enough, most of the details are done through mapping. My character model (not realtime, character...) is going to be this guy who looks like a skater, but he's not going to skate, he's going to do fancy soccer ball juggling tricks. Once I have enough time, I'll post up some pictures and talk a bit more about him in detail.  Also, this week is husky9's graduation ceremony, so her mom and her sis are in town... it's too bad that I don't have enough time to really bring them around, but husky9's got it handled. Happy graduation....

      This group project was actually finished and handed in a few weeks ago. I've been really lazy lately, so I didn't get around to posting any pics up.(Well it does take a bit more effort to prepare images for the web, and this time, there are heaps more stuff that I'm posting up, including a little flash animation. Actually, I'm amazed that I did get around to it at all.)   One of the plans was to also post up the quicktime mov of the animation for downloading, but the best compression I could achieve so far is 44MB, which is still way too big for just a 2 min video, and considering I've only got 30MB of webspace from my ISP... So I guess I'll just have to post up screen shots as the next best thing. Anyway, I've only got Adobe Premiere's default compressors to work with, which isn't good enough. I'll probably need to get my hands on Discreet Cleaner to get a better compression.   This project was done in a group of two, me and another guy from my class. We designed, modelled and rigged a robot and put together some kind of marketing video for it, as if its a real product from some big industrial corporation, like the Honda Asimo, kind of... My group partner is a huge robotics freak, so he came up with the technical design and specs for the limbs based on real robot designs. And he rigged the whole model for animation and also did the lighting and texturing. I did the conceptual design, and basically oversaw the whole aesthetic of the model. And I did the flash animation, compositing and editing. It was really good to have someone take care of the technical side of things, coz I'm really weak in that area(I'm probably left-brain dominant). I'm still crap at animating and rigging. I'll need to improve....           urlLink Screen Shots    urlLink Walk Cycle Animation

      Here's a bit of an update on my earlier blog entry about the Pixies' new single. The actual name of the song is 'Bam Thwok', and it is only available online through iTunes, coz the band is currently unsigned to any record label,(which I think is a good thing, coz record labels usually fuck up good bands by doing something they like to call 'marketing'). I can't really do an honest review of the song as I have a strong bias, but there's a pretty good one at  urlLink PitchforkMedia.com .  And while I was surfing around music websites for more info about the Pixies, I found out that Creed has disbanded. Hahaha.... I've always hated Creed, they were one of the dumbest pseudo-rock bands that conned the money of lame yuppies who like to think that they have an edge coz they listen to rock music. Don't they realise how cheesy their songs are? And how cheesy are their music videos? Where the lead singer is singing on top of a mountain in a Jesus pose and the wind is blowing in his mullet, or another one where he's dodging meteors?(For more info in why Creed is crap, go  urlLink here .) If only Nickelback would also disappear.

      Hallo... I've finally gotten around to putting up some flash animation to make my blog interface look a bit more interesting. First of all, I'd like to apologise to anyone who is still using dial up coz the page may now load a bit slower... and if you don't see anything, you might not have Flash player version 7 installed, so just get it from the Macromedia homepage, its free... (I have no idea how to embed the flash player test in the blog template, and I think it can't be done in the swf file, so your web browser won't automatically direct you to get the flash player, sorry). And if the looping animation gets too irritating, just press the 'stop' button.  Anyway, this week has had some highs and not so lows. First of all, the not so low is the fact that Euro 2004 is on and it is almost impossible to catch any matches here, coz everything's on Foxtel, and the matches are on at 2am and 4am everyday. I'm not desperate enough to hang around at pubs at that hour to watch the live matches, So I'm just surviving on highlights from Toyota World Sports and live updates from the Euro website. Sweden's doing remarkably well so far, they haven't lost a game yet, and they managed to clinch a draw from Italy at the last minute. To be honest, I don't really know that much about the Swedish team except for Freddy Ljungberg, but they've got two decent strikers, I like Henrik Larsson now, he's pretty good(currently in Celtic, I'm not really a Scottish league fan, so I've never heard of him 'til today). One of my classmates is a mad Swedish supporter (We are yellow! We are blue! we are Sweden! Who are you?!) He was even rooting for them during Korea/Japan.  And the highs... I was lucky enough to catch the Beastie Boys performing on Letterman the other night, coz I haven't really been staying up to watch Letterman these past few weeks, and this is the first time they've appeared anywhere since their last album six years ago. It was a great performance... they started from outside the studio, coming out from a subway entrance and there was a one camera shot of them performing as they made their way into the studio. I tried to download their new songs, but all the songs that I got were decoys. (In case you don't know, some smart guys have realised that if you flood the p2p databases with useless mp3 files with actual song titles, it would be a pretty big hassle for people like me to find the actual songs from all the decoy mp3 files. Which I think is pretty smart, so I bought their album.)  And the other high... The Pixies have just released a new single!!! And I heard it played the first time ever on radio in Australia on Triple J!!! This was another one of those lucky coincidences, I was in my car listening to the radio when they announced, 'NEW PIXIES SINGLE'! It was written by Kim Deal and she did the lead vocals. It is supposedly inspired by some children's colouring book that she found... I didn't really catch the song title, it sounded something like 'BandThwack'. I'm not sure, gotta check it out on the net. It sounded a little bit more like a Breeders song than a true Pixies song, but I can't really complain... it was still great to hear the Pixies together again.

      Good ol' Dubya.....  Just saw on the news last night that George W. is threatening to sour US relations with Australia if Mark Latham wins the election.  Ok, this is what I think really happened... John Howard is scared shitless of losing the election, so he runs crying to mommy, saying that Mark Latham wants to pull troops out of Iraq and Peter Garett hates USA and blah, blah, blah... So George W. calls up a press conference and issues the threat. (I mean, did you see the press conference on the news? John Howard has his own podium, side by side with George, and he's grinning like a weasel, like some smug, spoilt kid hiding behind mommy's dress.)  Isn't John Howard at all worried about the implications this threat has on Australia's sovereignty?   And of course, Alexander Downer is getting all flustered and worried about US relations, alluding that Mark Latham is irresponsible, etc... Well I remember a couple of years back when Australia was screwing East Timor out of its oil resources and he was being questioned on TV about it, he said, rather indignantly, that "I am actually the foreign minister for Australia, not East Timor." which shows his position on securing healthy relations with E.Timor(His position is that he doesn't give a shit about East Timor). I guess he doesn't mind being the foreign minister for USA.  ps (I'm not a supporter of the ALP or Mark Latham, I think both candidates are idiots)

      Hi there, it's been a while... Heheh, I almost forgot that I have a blog here for a second, I guess it's time to wipe off the cobwebs of this poor, neglected web diary of mine... Ok, first, a quick update, right after I handed in my Group Project, we got started on a new lesson module, which is Special Effects. In case you are not aware, in my college, Lesson Modules = Lots of Free Time, coz we only have three lessons a week, accompanied by two workshop days, which we normally use to do our own shit or play games, unless there are assignments. Project time is when we get really busy. So the first week of the Special Effects module was kinda like a holiday for me (even though I still had lessons), so I chilled out for that week and didn't spend too much time with my computer.   I wanted to go ice skating at Macquarie with husky9, but somehow that plan fell through, but we managed to watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Heheh, that was quite funny, coz it's already been playing in the cinemas for ages, so there were only five people in the cinema, which was kinda cool, like having a private screening. I'm glad I managed to catch it in the theatres though, coz it is an excellent movie, I'll probably talk more about it in one of my 'Dumbass Movie Reviews'. I was also reading up a lot about how to create and set up your own comic book (mostly from the eatpoo forums) coz I'm planning to post up a sequential online comic, which is oh so trendy rite now. It's gonna be in the style of the 'Love and Rockets' comics by Jaime Hernandez; straight monochrome black and white inks without fancy colour effects (coz I don't know how to do that crap).   I've also decided to rehaul the look of my blog, after husky9 told me about all these new templates that they've provided. Ok, as if normal html wasn't already too hard for a web moron like me, these new templates are in fuckin' xhtml... So it took me quite a while (with lots of help from husky9) to figure out how to customize the templates. Well, this is as much as I can do I guess. I may probably insert a small flash animation in the bottom right corner if I have the time, it looks a bit empty right now. (I really should think about putting in a language warning somewhere too, coz u know how I am...). My site meter's gone awol too, coz I forgot my userid, so I'll just have to wait for them to e-mail me one of their reports. Anyway, it doesn't matter that much, coz my traffic is really pathetic... oh well...   More interesting shit will happen to me! I can feel it!....

       Aaargh... sucked in again!!!   Last year, when I was still doing my IT module for my 3D course, I was given an assignment to find examples of dumb or crappy websites. Well, I just did what any lazy bastard would do, and Googled for 'Bad Websites', and I found this   urlLink  cheesy ninja site   , which I thought was a genuinely bad ninja fanboy site. It had all the basic hallmarks of bad web design... multicoloured fonts, incoherent layout, confusing navigation, cheesy midi soundtrack, it was just too good to be true, so this website became my assignment submission. It was not until I thoroughly read every page of the site that I realised that this website could not possibly be genuine... it is a freaking joke site!!! And I must admit, it is a pretty funny joke site too(really, check it out, it is HILARIOUS). So from then on, I became wary of anything that I read on the Internet, no matter how credible it looks, coz you never know...     But just a few days ago, I came across this  urlLink online news article  from msnbc, about a mishap that occurred when two kids read a book published in conjunction with  that  stupid ninja site, which resulted in the town trying to ban the book.... so there I was, feeling all&nbsp;high and mighty and being a smartass, thinking 'I can't believe they took that book seriously! It's meant to be a joke!!'     &nbsp;   And&nbsp;guess what....     &nbsp;   The news article is also fake..... &nbsp;    &nbsp;   I am such an idiot.... &nbsp;

      Euro 2004's finally over... so now I can finally shut up about soccer for a while, but I'm just gonna talk about it a bit more in this post...   Half of me is kinda glad that I didn't sit through the live match, coz I'm a fan of Real Madrid, so I was kinda going for Figo and his boys. So that would have been a real downer, especially after going through a goalless first half. But you have to appreciate the way soccer can really dish out the drama with its unpredictability... One of my favourite moments of the 2002 World Cup is the look on Anh Jung Hwang's face as he collapsed in relief after he scored the sudden death goal to beat Italy.   And thinking about it now, I'm kinda sorry that I didn't watch Sharapova kicking Serena Williams' ass, coz that would go down as one of the greatest upsets in Wimbledon, probably even greater than when Jelena Dokic beat Martina Hingis in the first round in her debut about four(?) years ago. I saw a photo of Sharapova dropping to her knees and crying after she had just won, which really brought home the emotional aspect of that match. Sharapova comes from a family of Russian Migrants, who moved to America when she was seven years old. Her parents sacrificed a hell of alot to put her in the Wimbledon finals... her mom had to stay behind in Russia for two years due to visa problems and her dad waited tables to fund her tennis.   And speaking of tennis, my favourite memory of Wimbledon was when Goran Ivanisevic made a comeback and went on to beat Pat Rafter in the finals.... I was in Phuket at that time with husky9 for a short vacation with friends. We stayed back a bit longer after our friends left and we found ourselves wandering around the night markets on the night of the finals.(I had kind of forgotten that Wimbledon was on). We then chanced upon a crowd of people who had gathered around a particular street vendor, who had a small tv with the Wimbledon Finals on... and we stayed to watch. The crowd had such a great vibe, a mix of tourists and locals who had congregated via their enthusiasm for sports. I was asking around for the score, and we struck up a conversation with this couple from Australia. The husband was so excited that he couldn't pronounce 'Ivanisevic' properly. And the vendor was pretty, funny, coz when he realised that there were a few Australians in the crowd, he started to cheer: 'Rafter! Rafter!....' I don't think we stayed for the entire match, coz we were standing, and the reception of the tv wasn't that good, but we stayed for as long as we could, at least until it was clear that Rafter had no chance to win.   I've been watching tennis for over ten years and I don't know why that was such a strong memory for me... If I was given a choice, I'd definitely prefer to be watching in a comfortable couch with a big ass tv... Probably bcoz, I've never experienced watching tennis like that,(sports bars don't show tennis matches coz they can go for five hours)

      Its the finals of Euro 2004 tonight, I really want to catch it live, but its a really big ask for me to haul my lazy ass to the city at 4am to find a sports bar. And its gonna get pretty hairy after the match, coz either the Portuguese or the Greeks in town are going to go nuts tonight. When Greece won against the Czechs to get to the finals a couple of days ago, the city was overrun with crazy soccer fans waving Greek flags and police sirens were going off every ten minutes. (That was the night when I was out for drinks at Soho, and I walked home along George Street)   I'm so distracted, I've even lost all interest in the Wimbledon finals.(Especially after all the rain delays), But I heard on the radio that Sharapova won, which is good news to me, coz I don't really like the Williams Sisters, they're like the Michael Schumacher of Women's Tennis... As I am typing this blog entry, Federer is playing Roddick, and Roddick is leading by one set.... I'm pretty impartial to either players, but Roddick looks a bit like Stiffler from American Pie, so I'm gonna hope for him to win.

      I need to get my head checked...  I had my car scheduled for a servicing on tuesday morning this week, and I completely forgot about it.... It only occurred to me when I was driving later on that tuesday afternoon, when I had this surreal feeling of: 'being in this car at this time is breaking some law of physics' kinda deal... and then it hit me... SERVICING!!! So I had to reschedule it to friday... and guess what...   I forgot again!!  This has never occurred to me, I mean, I can get pretty absentminded at times, but I've never forgotten stuff like appointments and errands. I mean, I used to have a filofax once(for those of you born after 1990, a filofax is kinda like a pda, but made of paper, and you can't play solitaire with it.), but the only thing that I've ever used it for was to write down contact numbers, which was kind of a hassle, coz you had to update it once in a while. And when mobile phones came... well, bye bye filofax!(I actually still have my good ol filofax with me, and looking through all the contacts that I had written down, I seriously do not recall who half of them are.) So I'm pretty good at remembering due dates and stuff, I managed to go through uni without ever using those free student diaries, I just knew where and when my classes were and when stuff was due.   Its probably a sign of my age, I'm losing brain cells. But this week, my mind has been pretty distracted lately. Its now officially project time, and so I've been pretty busy... and also me and two other guys from class are planning to produce a 3D animated short to send in to this year's AEAF(Aust Effects and Animation Fest), so I've been trying to come up with ideas for a concept and a narrative. And on top of that, a friend of mine wants to start up a small multimedia company, and I've come aboard as a partner, so we've been working out some details about our business model. I am typically a very lazy person, so I'm going a bit nuts....  On a positive side, my school organised this function at the Soho Bar last night, which was basically just a mixer for everyone in school to get to know the faculty and people from other courses. That was pretty fun. I saw the head of student services' twin brother, which looked astonishingly like him(they've got the same gothic hairstyle and goatee and piercings). And everybody was so wasted by the time I got there, people who I hardly knew were telling me their life stories, and I heard some funny shit(one of my male classmates crashed at my tutor's place after a night out, and coz it was a small place, he had to share a bed with this other male tutor, and they somehow ended up spooning. There's supposed to be a photo of it floating somewhere, but I've never seen it. Some people were telling me that it was photoshopped, but I'll be the judge of that).
