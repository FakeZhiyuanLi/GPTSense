      OMG... Im soo happy.. hahaha :D alrite let me start from the beginning... I woke up around 8.30.. getting ready for soccer... well guess what.. I read the wrong timetable again.. I read it as for the second team game... soo I went to school around 9 and my game start at 10.45 HOOORAY !!! go meee... i have to wait for around an hour waiting for everyone to arrived.. lol sitting there like a loser watching the second game.. but oh well its fun.. :D  I soo looking forward for this game.. soo i drank 2 red bull which u shouldnt be allowed tooo but anyway i drank it and make me SUPER FIT... soo im like the only 1 so hyperactive during the warm-up....... warm-up we dont really have to do anyfink we just run 1 lap of the oval denn jog and sprint practice... get the feel of the pitch... and yeahh its hell wet and cold outside.. but we got used to it quite quickly... enough about the warm-up...   The game started and we pushed hell hard for the first 5 mins and me and blaine create quite a lot of chances and yet we still couldnt score any goals.. and in the next 10 mins somehow Guilford take control of the game and they managed to score the first goal.. and YES we hell down that time.. but JUSTIN our captain motivated us that we can win this game.. soo Here we go again.. we pushed hard and guess what... Brett score a goal around 15 mins later... denn come Anthony scoring another goal... before the half time finished... We won by 1 goals... but everyone still not happy with the result...  The second half I been put into right midfield from the forward line.. but wait... I played better in the midfield.. lol :D weird but yeahh.. after 15 mins into the second half, blaine score a goal from my assist. *GOO ME* and we all hell happy.. well nearly everyone but not me... coz all the forward scored a goal already except me... but dw thats not finish... nearly at the end of the game... Brett crossed the ball in and Jake header the ball back to me and I took that change with a half volley and i thought i wouldnt score the goal.. but YEAH God was on my side and I scored the goal.. OMG the feeling scoring a goal.. is like WOW... soo happy hahahah :D and yes the whistle went...  And Aquinas won again 4 - 1... still on the top of the ladder leading with 7 points... hahaha :D soo happy everyone worked hard and yes its possible for us to win the cup.. :D GO AC

      Today yr 11 and 12 Tee and Art n Design Class went to the art gallery the one in the city... Art Gallery in the city always got updated every month probably.. Thats why we always went here every year for art excursion. This gallery was divided into many different sections. I tell you about it later on...   Anyway today I set my alarm around 7 oclock but well guess what I do ? I woke up turn the alarm off and slept again.. lol luckily my brother woke me up again around 7.20 and took me approx. around 15 mins to get ready... pretty quick huh.. lucky :D If im one of those gals out there it will took me probs around 30 mins.. *no offense* but its true.. hahaha :P anyway yeah i left my house around 7.45 coz i supposed to meet Jake Traviskis.. *is that how u spell ur last name* in front of the library in our school.. Denn we took da bus together... and guess what everyone else was quite late.. damn So we play hacky sack in front of the library and yeah we looks like weirdo but wait.. ITS FUN :D hahahah :P lets move on... so we have a quick briefing about whats going to happened 2day.. which ended around 30 mins and then teachers gave us around 1 hour to do quick sketches on anyfink... and yeahh we looks like a weirdo again coz it was raining outside and theres 30 of us sitting in front of the library facing different direction drawing different objects.. people like staring at us.. but mehh im cool with it.. lol in fact im enjoying my time.. :D  Anyway 1 hour is up den we gather again in front of the gallery and went inside... We went to the section where top studios from students doing TEE art got selected... and OMG its f*cking awesome.. I still amazed how some ppls can do a freaking good piece of art.. ohh yeah maybe they dont have life.. but anyway its still f*cking good... then yr 12 tee students have to selected one of the piece in that gallery and talk a little bit about em in front of everyone.. and YES its embarrassing and YES we looks like a weirdo again and YES its boring but mehh... hahahah :D  After that we have a really quick 15 mins break and yeah we stayed in the gallery since its raining hell heavy outside and in fact everyone stayed.. 15 mins is up denn we all went to see all the visual diary.. and YES its hell thick and YESS its gud and YESSS they dont have any life.. I mean their visual diary is like a novel that I read for class.. lol :D my legs started to hurt since we all stand up all the time from 8.30 till around 12... Well my teacher ask the same question again  "SOOO DO U GUYS FOUND IT HELPFUL LOOKING AT THESE VISUAL DIARY"  and everyone simply answered  "OH YEAHH ITS VERY HELPFUL TO MAKE US DEPRESSED"  coz our visual diary compared to them is like nothing... oh yeahh i forgot our  yr 12 TEE ART is full of slackers thats including me btw hahaha :D we always waste time doing useless think "check email, play hacky-sacks, talk, draw random stuff and so on...    And then we have 1 hour lunch break.. yeahh i knew thats a bit long.. but anyway one of our teacher said this  "make sure if you go anywhere always walked in a group"  den my fren add  "and dont forget to hold hands!!!"  hahahah :D anyway me, will, jai and jake went to maccas getting food for lunch and yes Jai tried being a chippo buying drink from subway and buying BIGMAC from maccas... hahaha and worst will (the smallest guy among us) actually ate the most.. first he ordered a triple cheese-burger den order another cheese-burger and then he ordered another big mac... everytime he ordered something.. the three of us always said "U R A PIG" and he simply answered "YEAH.. pig is cool" hahahah :D we went back to art gallery and played hacky-sacks again ohh yeah btw CHRIS bring the hacky sacks.. and the funny thing happened.. theres this two guys randomly came to us and joined us.. we're like "hmm RANDOMs?" ahhaha :D but yeah they pretty shit... lol :D  Then after lunch finish we went to CENTRAL TAFE... and YES our teachers is hell weird.. its supposed to be an art excursion but they brought us to tafe to look at how "photography" and "design" is like in CENTRAL TAFE.. and one of us said the stupidest question ever.. he asked in front of everyone "Wat does ART have to do with photography and "design" isn't this wasting our time?" and guess what the two lecturers is actually there as well.. hahaha :D soo our teacher tell him to shut up and not to asked a random question again...  After walking there and waste our time for an hour or soo den finally we all get dismissed and find our own way to get back.. But the funny thing all YR 12 TEE ART have to go back to school to grabs something.. soo yeah we all went back to school..   BTW theres 9 of us in our class; Chriss (laziest among us), Oscar (the best), Jake, Jai, Will, Michael, Paul, Benjamin, then come me... Though my teachers always said this "Im pretty sure u guys have the skill to do better than any of them in this gallery" but im pretty sure shes "BS" oh well it might turn to reality again as i mentioned before lol :P

      This is a bit late... but better than never right.. :D well in this article I'm going to write about MY life, so for you people who not very interested in other people life dont bother reading this hahaha :D   Well I dont want to write in detail but basically I was born from a happy family soo i should say  IM PRETTY LUCKY  yeahh.. :D well I have 1 older brother and i hate him soo much.. lol not really well he kinda help me a lot but still I hate him hahaha *no offense dude* nahh ur a cool brother I reckon..  Well enough about my family... lets talk a little bit about my self I was born on the 14th of January as many people probs know from the personal detail, but someone who doesnt explore this website probs wouldnt know.. hahahah :D *stop side-tracking alex* alrite.. back to my life^^ anyway first 12 yrs of my life is pretty boring... Welll I go to pre-primary school and then bla.. bla..bla...   In 1998, There was   ASIAN CRISIS  WOW and guess wat ? INDONESIA was probs one of the worst country who got effected by it.. anyway during that time I was having my examination to enter highschool... and guess what? I didnt do it.. soo happy in fact parents thinking to move to singapore in the first place.. But wait thats not all they change their plan and fly to this Koala island.. WOW... First I was kinda shock.. since I have no idea about this country and I hardly know any english.. So we were thinking to stay here until Indonesia is settle down... but wait my life change completely. We decided to stayed here and since we are permanent residents already, thats not a problem for us... I found my self a primary school and I still can remember the school, the teacher and in fact I still keep contact with them until now... hahahah quite cool huh? *not really*   Anyway... life goes on since u can only stay in that primary school for 1 year since its a language school soo I moved to Booragoon primary in year 7... and guess what this school have no ASIAN at all, the first time I came there I was hell scared but later on it was quite fun actually. And I still can remember my teacher told me this  "Alex.. you know what.. your the only 1 in this primary school who plays with the year 6 n 7, because none of them ever play together"   hahahha... wait I'm not finish... u guys now probs think "errr what a show off" read my reason... the reason i play with the year 6 is because they play soccer during recess and lunch where as the year 7 play footy... lol :P soo u know... hahaha :D gud reason yeah.. admit it..  Time flies rite 1 year passed... I graduate primary school yey.. and came to  Applecross Senior Highschool   believe it or not this school probably the best school ever.. It contains more than 25% ASIAN and 70% oz 5% old lady and man.. I mean teachers.. :p first time i stepped into the gym... the atmosphere is like different  wow... soo many brothers and sisters..  LOL ;) hahahah well I was kinda wasted yr 8.. didnt study in facts I played around all the time *lazy me* and my brother actually make me not doing any study at all he said this  "Its ok if u failed subjects in yr 8 and 9. Failed in yr 8 and 9 = Passed"  What a gud bro. eyy ? hahahah :D   Well one year pass then   BELIEVE OR NOT   i have to move to all-guys school. First I was finking to my self " what !!!   my parents want to make me gay?"  and whats good in that going to school contains boys only... I mean come on you definitely not looking forward to going to school the next day. When you wake up in the morning you probably think ahhh I have to go to school surrounded by guys.. yey HOW FUN !!! hahahah   "but think positive (copyright from LOUIS)"   I been at this school for almost 4 yrs, quite a long time hey.. And now I knew most of the teachers and in fact teachers here became more like friends. You can talk about sports and weekend everyday .. hahaha soo fun :D and you got to share stuff and ask for advice and my friends are hell awesome as well.. not only the asian but the oz as well.. lol thats why I tried my self to be hell open. I mean like not talking to randoms yr 9 kid. ahhaha :P yeah you get the idea right.. But now im quite happy actually that I moved to this school... I cant imagined how many things I gained from this school... lol I wonder what going to happen at the end of the years.. 4 YRS quite hard to say "GOOD-BYE"...   Damn looking back to my history... I'm quite sad now lol... What I'm trying to say in this article is   "I WISH I COULD TURN BACK THE TIME"   and beside this is the place where "BS" turn to reality rite.. maybe it will became true one day that i can turn back time.

      Well Soccer in this kangaroo land doesn't seems to be most peoples fav. sports, where in fact in most of the ASIAN country soccer is one of their national sports that everyone  SHOULD PLAY...  I mean should  "play"  aint like footy, soccer involve more skills in it.. I mean not saying footy is shit, but what Kent said today "soccer do involve in agility and sharpness work" LOL... If someone who loves footy, I suggest not to read this... :D dw i love footy as well hahaha...  Being in the First team members for Aquinas college in fact is a really good thing that I should be proud of. Before I didnt really care about this year soccer team, but as time goes by in fact I started to love playing in the team, since most of the players are in yr 12 and I've been playing soccer with them for almost 2 yrs. I started to committed my self to the team by turning up to the training on time, take the training serious, bla2... My couch in fact said  "if you give all your best during the training session, there always be a room for improvement.. although you probably might not realise.. but its true"   This year First Soccer Team have played and trained very hard.. Our first game is against Christ Church Grammar School. Everyone was very nervous for our first match, however we created quite a lot of chances to score a goal.. Somehow we couldn't managed to do it. Thanks to our forward *Me n Blaine* hahaha :D well at least we gave our best right?. We drew against CCGS 0 - 0 and everyone wasn't very happy with the score. In fact Im not very happy as well since I shot on goals more than 5 times but hit the post twice.   Anyway move on to our second game against Scotch College. Their first team last year was unbeatable and thats made us not very confidence on winning the match, but wait... All of us trained very hard that week. During those 2 training session (Tuesday and Thursday) we spent most of the time doing fitness work. What i mean by fitness is running around the oval, push-ups, sit-ups, sprint, jog.. Those 2 training session really gave me soo much shit* When I get back from training I hardly can do anything, I went to bed for almost 3 hours hahaha :D Anyway we managed to score 2 goals against Scotch and in fact they aint that good and again I didnt score any goals which for me quite depressing as a forward. And thanks to Blaine Tristan and Chris Carr who scored the goals giving us an absolute win against them.   Right now Aquinas College was in the first place on the ladder then come Wesley in the second place and then Trinity College Third...   I'm pretty sure that "AC First Soccer Team" will win the cup this year, when everyone who didnt play soccer think that our first team is always the worst than any of the rest schools.  So wish us luck (like Louis said) for this coming game on Saturday against Guildford, which I reckon they're not that good... :D LOL

      I often wonder why some people can be very good at school,I mean on tests and exams. After today Accounting class I came up with a conclusion that  LIFE IS QUITE UNFAIR   Well today in my accounting class my teacher, MR Serl *dont know how to spell his name* lol.. gave out our topic test back.. and luckily I passed my test... Im sorry but Im not going to tell my mark. hahaha :P anyway when I get the test I was pretty disappointed because I thought I could get a better mark than that.. but oh well at least I passed it quite high above the average... well nearly everyone in the class was happy and only 2 or 3 mates didnt look that happy.... but as we all asked each other mark.. Everyone marks seems to get quite bunch up around the 50 - 70% line..  I ask the guy who always got the top mark and apparently he was sitting in front of me. As usual he always got the top mark and get the mini chocolate bar hahaha :D damn I want them. Then I ask him what did he got and he answer "96%" Im quite surprise since everyone think its a pretty hard test.. and I think to my self that this guy have study hell hard before the test, but wait... thats not all.  I ask him another question.. "soo how long did u studied last night?" and he simply answered me "around 15 mins" from that on... my thought was wondering around.. how the hell he got 96% wif 15 minutes study and i studied for almost 2 hours yet couldn't achieve that mark.. and how some ppls studied more than me and got worst marks.. If that what ppls reckon fair.. I fully disagree..   Someone told me about this..  "I know this world is unfair... often people   worked very hard yet didnt achieve the mark they wanted to be...  *Then she said some people was born genius and some people was not* ... and for the people whos not genius the only way they can beat the genius is by hardworking..."  After she told me about that.. I think to my self.. "hmm wait the minute.. soo that mean the only way I can beat them is by hardworking.. but I'm still not quite happy from the fact they only need to study for 15 mins and achieve a high mark where I'm in this case have been studying quite hard but didnt achieve the marks i want it to be.."   So basically what I'm trying to say here is that "YES THIS LIFE IS UNFAIR" and the second thing is " Are you the  "hardworking"  type or the  "genius"  type? "
