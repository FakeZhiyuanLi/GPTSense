      I love it when females, when asked the question "What would your perfect guy be like ?", respond with a cliche-from-my-ass type answer along the lines of "The perfect guy !?? Where to begin...!!"........as if they've got this really deeply thought out criteria on guys, and have spent their life dreaming about the perfect guy........ who is going to ride in on a white horse, and sweep her away from this cruel world to marry her in a rainbow filled land of fairies and over-priced facial products.  But back in old 'Reality' land where yours truely resides, those same girls probably had their mouths forming O shapes around the shaft of some guy they met at a club earlier that night......who they know only as 'That cute guy standing near the hatstand'. It's really a load of Mums old tampons if you ask me.  Ask a guy, and he'll be totally honest about it. "Nice tits, not too fat, nice face......yea that'll do me." Straight and to the point. He doesn't confuse issues by making up a lot of specifics which are just going to make it an IMPOSSIBLE criteria to fill..........giving them ample opportunity to sit around and moan to anyone within earshot how hard life is, and how they may never ever meet "the one".  My heart, it bleeds. No really.

      Howdy doody folks. I see the hits for this page has hit the big "60" mark, which in the terms of Internet and its millions of users........is an absolute landmark of ginormous proportions. I'm sure I'll have all sorts of Awards and Badges to put up on this site soon, but in the meantime, while you're reading this you can feel comfortable in the knowledge that you're probably reading it along with 1.....maybe 2 other people. To be perfectly honest with you, the only reason I'm even writing this is because I'm waiting for my electric blanket to heat up. That doesn't mean my life hasn't been filled with an array of adventures to report on, ranging from buying clothes, to downloading 38,000 ringtones.........adventures of massive magnitudes like eating fish n chips two nights in a row......and adventures of completely mindboggling incomprehensibility, such as waking up early on Saturday morning so a plumber can come into your house to fix the hotwater tank for the woman living below you, but he doesn't turn up.  I'm not going to go into these events in any detail now, I'll save them for my biography. I suppose while I'm on the topic, I should probably try and come up with a title for it now.........."One day at a time : The life and works of ..." or "The Envelope Pusher"....or perhaps "Ha ha you paid for this, you sucker". Actually, from a marketing perspective I should probably save that last title for the first chapter.....  Worst, update, ever.

      I must have swallowed about 4 litres of snot in the past couple of days. That whole thing where you snifffffff, then swallow as it runs down your nasal passage and into the back of your throat. Lovely stuff. I'm home today from work, deciding that having to sniff every 30 seconds or so, and having little trails of snot running down from my nose, probably isn't the 'best' look for seeing clients. My TV is on, and Ricky Lake is still keeping the White Trash TV alive it would seem. I'm pretty sure Osama Bin Laden showed Ricky Lake episodes to the guys who hijacked those planes, to convince them it was worth sacrificing their lives. Hell, I've been listening to it as I type this, and I'm tempted to take up flying lessons myself. (A note the the FBI : Before you switch on the air raid sirens and turn up at my house with your ear-pieces and loud booming voices, get your head of the sand and realise that given the opportunity, 99% of the world outside of America would demolish your shitty country, and especially it's human-like ape of a President) Speaking of which, I ordered a new  urlLink t-shirt .  Keeping on this theme, Michael Moores new movie  urlLink Farenheit 9/11  comes out this month. After taking out the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and getting a LOT of publicity thanks to Disney pulling the plug on Miramax distributing it around America, its bound to get a lot of viewing. After seeing the trailer and reading various reviews of it, it seems like he's just restating a lot of what people already know about George Bush, his family, and the war in Iraq. But the difference is, he's done it in such a way that your average cowboy hat wearing, dropout, lower class, burger flipping, white trash, hillbilly.......should be able to get what the message of the movie is. And with elections in the US coming up in November, that's pretty important yea ?

      Yes folks, your eyes don't decieve you. After getting over 20 billion e-mails from hungry fans wanting to read more from me, I've bowed under the enormous pressure and decided to make another post.  *waits for the applause to die down*  Let me tell you the tale of the 'Freaky black guy' (Disclaimer: No racial slur is intended, it's just he's freaky, and he's black, ok ? Good). I'll try and make this account as accurate as possible, as it may be used in evidence in a court trial at a later date. ......anywho, on with the tale.  A few months ago I had to come home with the work car (I don't have a car of my own, so the novelty factor is high when you get to zip around in the work car, Broom Broom !) to grab some tools for a job I was going to. After I'd got the neccesary tools-`o-the-trade I went back out to the car, and as I was getting in, the FBG (We'll call him that from now on) was walking past, and asked if I could give him a ride in the car to the train station at the bottom of the hill. Being the courteous and polite person I am, I replied "Sweet as sister !" with a hearty smile, and in he got. It's not that far to drive to the bottom of the hill, which is lucky, because there's only so much conversation you can have about a hill, and a trainstation......which is as far as I wanted to go conversationaly with the guy. Anyways, I get to the train and drop the guy off, but before he gets out of the car he quickly grabs my leg up about the lower thigh region, then gets out. I just sort of sit there thinking ".....was that acceptable practice for someone who has just been given a ride in a strangers car ?" In hindsight, probably not. Having been spared from possible molestation I mostly forgot about this incident, until a friend of mine (who happens to be the only person reading this, and will most likely ever read this...Hi liz !) mentioned something about him acting creepy at her work, and just sitting there staring at her. She also mentioned how he'd meet up with someone in a somewhat 'formal' capacity at the Cafe she works at. This person he'd meet up with would ask him questions and write down notes on some pages. Parole officer ? Social worker ? "helping put pedophiles back in the community" trust worker ? Who knows !  So after all this, today I was merrily riding the train from town back to my home suburb of ******. I get off at my station and FBG is standing there waiting to get on. I give him a quick glance then walk past him, but as I'm walking past he cunningly puts out his foot to try and trip me up.....!!! His attempt is highly unsuccessful, but obviously I'm left feeling a bit 'What the fuck is up with that shit?'. I stop and turn round to look at him, but he's already getting on the train........probably to check out the big Trench Coat sale thats going on in town. Or to checkout various shoe stores and ask for 'the quietest pair of sneakers you've got'.   Anyways, I'm sure I'll have more to post about FBG in the future. And incase this is taken in evidence,  after he's sliced my head off in the middle of the night and shit down my neck........I, *** ***, being of sound body and mind, do hereby solemnly swear that all the above is true. ...........except for the 20 billion e-mails part.

      After that that dramatic first step, I may as well throw caution to the wind and start posting something with some actual content. Of course when you know that only one person (Yes, that's you liz) is actually going to read it, it's a bit difficult to know wht to post. Infact this is a bit like talking to myself through Internet.  But anywho,  urlLink here  are some interesting  urlLink links . That's right folks, Smokey the Bear says "Domestic violence isnt cool". And liz I'm only posting this because I know Tim beats you around the head and the neck with a broken bottle Jake the Muss styles on a daily basis.   If you would like to talk about about anything you've read about in the Blog today, please ring the free Lifeline 0800 number, on 0800 LIFELINE.
