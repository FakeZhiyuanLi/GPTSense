      Well, I wanted to write and there was no paper laying within close proximity so I thought, what the hell....i'll try a blog.  Not too much going on here today, the usual weekday routine...work, lunch, work, home, beer.  In case you do not know me my name is M., I turn 23 next week, I live in this dreadful small town in central Illinois, nothing too excieting to report.  I've been single since February.  I dated this guy for like 2 years and was planning on getting married to him sometime in the near future, that is until I met his other girlfriend.  I felt pretty stupid because he had apparently been maintaining both relationships for a year.  I was pretty crushed.  I had a stupid one night rebound fling which made me feel better for like 2 days but other than that I am still pretty bummed to be single.  Like I said, I live in this small town which has nothing to do and there are no guys around my age so picking a future partner from this area is like impossible.  I have not had sex for like 5 months or something and I think I am starting to feel the effects of it.  I have been having crazy sex dreams at night involving random people.  I woke up this morning and was like "Oh my god, you need a boyfriend girl!"  But, I have taken a vow to not have meaningless sex anymore.  I am saving myself for a steady boyfriend.  My 5 year class reunion is coming up....barf!!!  When I was younger I never really understood why it was such a big deal to go to one of these things, but now that I am at this point I am totally dreading it.  Like 80% of the class is married/engaged with kids and all that.  I on the other hand have no boyfriend and a dog.  I am going to be one of these crazy dog ladies I think.  Everyone else will have pictures of their recently created families and I will have pictures of my dog wearing a ball cap.  Well, I dont have much to post tonight....I'll keep ya waiting for more.  Goodnight!  ~~M.
