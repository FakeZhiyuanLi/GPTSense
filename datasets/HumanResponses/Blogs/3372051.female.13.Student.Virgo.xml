      I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you

      Ang Huling El Bimbo Eraserheads  Kumukha mo si Paraluman  Nung tayo ay bata pa  At ang galing-galing mong sumayaw  Mapa-Boogie man o Cha-Cha  Ngunit ang paborito  Ay ang pagsayaw mo ng EL Bimbo  Nakaka-indak, nakakaaliw  Nakakatindig-balahibo   Pagkagaling sa eskwela  Ay dideretso na sa inyo  At buong maghapon ay tinuturuan mo ako   Refrain:  Magkahawak ang ating kamay  At walang kamalay-malay  Na tinuruan mo ang puso ko  Na umibig na tunay   Naninigas ang aking katawan  Kapag umikot na ang plaka  Patay sa kembot ng bewang mo  At pungay ng iyong mga mata  Lumiliwanag ang buhay  Habang tayo'y magkaakbay  At dahan-dahan dumudulas  Ang kamay ko sa makinis mong braso   Sana noon pa man ay sinabi na sa iyo  At kahit hindi na uso ay ito lang ang alam ko   (Repeat)   lalalala lalala....   At lumipas ang maraming taon  Hindi na tayo nagkita  Balita ko'y may anak ka na  Ngunit walang asawa  Tagahugas ka raw ng pinggan sa may Ermita  At isang gabi'y nasagasaan sa isang madilim na eskenita   Lahat ng pangarap ko'y bigla lang natunaw  Sa panaginip na lang pala kita maisasayaw   (Refrain 2x)   lalalala...

        i'm so tired of being here suppressed by all my childish fears and if you have to leave i wish that you would just leave 'cause your presence still lingers here and it won't leave me alone  these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  [chorus] when you cried i'd wipe away all of your tears when you'd scream i'd fight away all of your fears i held your hand through all of these years but you still have all of me  you used to captivate me by your resonating life now i'm bound by the life you left behind your face it haunts my once pleasant dreams your voice it chased away all the sanity in me  these wounds won't seem to heal this pain is just too real there's just too much that time cannot erase  [chorus]  i've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone but though you're still with me i've been alone all along  [chorus

      EverYtimE ~BRitnEy Spears  Come notice me And take my hand So why are we Strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me?  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I make believe That you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry  Ohhhh  At night I pray That soon your face Will fade away  And everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  After all... After all...

      *my day did start great cause i decided to give up on MySterYGuY. I likE to Say theSe thinGs to him.. by one of the greatest song I know*  balisong by rivermaya  Your face lights up the sky on the highway. Someday, you'll share your world with me someday. You mesmerize me with diamond eyes; I try to fool myself to think I'll be alright. But I am losing all control - My mind, my heart, my body and my soul  Never in my life have I been more sure, So come on up to me and close the door. Nobody's made me feel this way before; You're everything I wanted and more.  To speak or not to; where to begin. The way dilemmas I'm finding myself in. For all I know you only see me as a friend. I try to tell myself wake up fool; this fairy tale's got to end.  "Never in my life have I been more sure, So come on up to me and close the door. Nobody's made me feel this way before; You're everything I wanted (more)." (Repeat 2x)  You're everything I wanted
