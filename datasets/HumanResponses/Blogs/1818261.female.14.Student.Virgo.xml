      Sumtyms its really hard to decide whos ryt n whoes rong...it often impossible to tell.  Um...i guess i jus h8 it wen u think u can trust sum1 but u actually cant, or wen they say theyre on ur side wen its jus a freaking joke?!?!?! n after they win ur trust they jus go around around spreading f***** rumours. Then they tell every1 that ur the evil one??? thats just totally crazy..i mean does it really even matter abt whoes ryt n whos wrong, if u tell them ur not the evil 1...will they even believe?

      when people say they reali care abt u, do dey reali mean it?? Or do dey jst say it 2 show dey r a caring person? Or do dey jst say it lyk "a figure of speech"?? I duno how many tms ive heard dat line ( proberly countless) but wat i cant figure out is  which of those tyms r true ?? i know wen sum ppl say it, dey just say it naturally, wifout any meaning, lyk its just part of dem. But wen sum oda ppl say it, dey actuali mean it. The problem now is,how do i noe which 1s r telling lies n which 1s r sayin wat dey reali mean?  By their expression? Their Tone of Voice? Or Just da way how dey deliver the msg??  I duno where or wen im going 2 find da answer, i hope i can seek 4 it... somehow ...  comments any 1??  jenny

      knowing that your big brother is sick is not exactly what you'd call a good thing. Infact,knowing anyone who is sick is not a good thing. knowing those ppl who are sick is not a good thing, but   knowing some1 who is close 2 you is sick is a BAD thing  there is a difference. Jonathan has been sick for a week now, and according to ppl, he is REALLY sick. i dont know whether he is worry or just plain sick. but wateva it is i hope he'd get well soon. Or maybe Jonathan is fine...Jenny you worry 2 much...]  Jenny

      Its raining in Hong Kong today, but its better then how im feeling now. the sky is s dull, but my heart is even worse. Knowing that your God Brother is really sick is not a good thing, especailly when your god brother is really good. right now, that is what i am going through. In 2 weeks time, i am going to go back to the place where i Dont belong ...SYDNEY. yes, sydney is a great place and everything, but its just not a place for me, especially when right now you are in the place where you belong. Me?? i reckon i belong in Hong Kong, i grew up there (in Hk) so why do i not belong there? Staying in Hong Kong would be the one and only thing i would wish for, nut my one and only wish would never come true...unnless i staring making it true....  Jenny
