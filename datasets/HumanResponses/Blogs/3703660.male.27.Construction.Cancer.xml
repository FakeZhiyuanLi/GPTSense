      my sister come and visited me today she bought my niece and nephiew with her its great to see tham all again things have been pretty intense the past few years with her but now i feel as thought things are improving greatly i missed the little ones so much jack is growing up so fast he is 2 on monday and alex is 8 soon too shes female so she will mature quicker than jack im sure. hope all my mates are good. me my self i feel a little odd about something but when i figure it out im sure ill sort it right away. oh incase you were worried about daves pc its sorted now i had an old one doing nothing i replaced it with that hes chuffed now coz it runs alot of games his old one never his old one didnt run windows xp let alone a game hehe now he runs anything he wants so my job is done.

      its a lovely tuesday morning and i dont really have much to say today i seen my woman last night even if for just a few hours i love everymoment i get with her my last relationship was a mess me and her were great her friends were scum the always did what they could to split us up they lied to me constantly saying she either died in car crashes or commited suicide or ran off with other guys and if i had a go at them id be in trouble by her she was a screw up it ended because one of her friends (after countless lies) told my gf i had been having an affair which was untrue she said she had proof which i never ever seen which just proves shes as bad as her friends but im not assed about that coz i have photos and a few addresses of theirs and when im ready i will see them (yes you read it right) and when i do god will they regret what they did and what they put me through over them years.

      hey all hows tricks? hope all are good today was a pretty exciting day at work i shifted a fair bit of rock today between 3 of us there was a total of 20 tons shifted the other 2 guys are all aches and pain but me at present i feel good and could have easily done another 9 hours i think but im taking it easy and i promised my mother (s) hehe that i wouldnt work too hard and would take it easy. btw does anyone know if fireflys actually have purpose? to me they are simply annoying little insects that need stepping on hard but if cant step on one i would like to I may as well destroy the maggots they consider important there are 3 i can think of and can actually get to within 24 hours and they are james mer and the wierd looking tadpole called Eugene i have their addresses and boy oh boy will they know about it soon. hitting the problem thats 10k miles away right in the face and then there is a case of an address i have too which isnt too far from a zoo and the father and mother arent well thought of but thats a different matter. we shall see who has the last laugh not alot of people can be screwed up enough to lie about exs in such ways and i never lied to this mistake. her friends did all the lying. she thinks shes making things tough for me she hasnt a fucking clue. this is by far the most fucked up thing i did using a website to take things off my chest but if it works for the scum over in there then it works for me coz i am considered worse than them i prefer action to words. and there is some action to come soon you fat ugly firefly.  ps to all them who dont know what my past few posts have been on about ill tell you in the next few days its pretty trivial i know using my site i dont even think she knows about this site it just gets shit off my chest (boo hoo) basically an ex of mine has a site of hers and now we finished (her friends lied that i did something i didnt) she thinks its cool to post lies and try and insult me on it which is good coz the earlier mentioned friend and tadpole are the main people in her twisted life so ill get them they are closer for a start and i owe them big time. as for her she made one ex commit suicide she wont drag me to his lever and take the pussy;s way out no way (man i wish she could read this) well no more about that mistakes happen it could be a month week year or more before i get these asses and a "close friend of hers" tells me everything that happens most evenings so i find out anything (she hacks her conversations and stuff) cool eh.

      hello there sorry about the lack off update on this site not much has happened and ive been busy trying to get a few things for when i start work on monday as well as helping some friends out with their stuff i read a really interesting site it belongs to one of my ex mistakes (girlfriends) she thinks shes clever insulting people on it which is quite amusting she was a bit of a simplton when i was with her i guess not much has changed but thats what happens when people WANT to be irish and hang around with irish they suck the inteligence out of people but sheep have purposes they make the landscape look good and they save money on tractors cutting the grass you thick bitch (pmsl) the foerign people havent a clue about anything. i guess send them to ireland and sink it the only good thing about ireland is guinness and the paddys get foreign people to work their coz its cheaper. but ive never been better i never get dragged down by scum such as her. and when the time is right ill hurt her more than she imagined that would be worth all the money in the world coz she will wonder how i got the details to visit them people that insult me and my family whilst they are in their homes. jajajaja
