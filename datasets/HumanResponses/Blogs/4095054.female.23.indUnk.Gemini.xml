      so ive spent the day researching and what not,  ive found my points target is 28 which is fine! ive done that before i can do it again.  along with that there are 35flexpts to use over the week... in a way i hate having the 'yay i can eat more' feeling but they are kind of nice to have around in case im in a restaurant and am nto sure of the total pts of a dish. anyway! i have a qestion about activity points... if anyone might be able to answer it (not sure if anyone reads this LOL so i might figure things out on my own eventually) the most exercise i will do is:  30min walk OR bike once a day.  and about 3 days a week doing strength training.  from time to time i'll pop in a video or do some floor exercises  but overal what is the rule about calculating activity points? is it basically 100cals of exercise = 2 activity points?  as it is with the food?  im not quite sure but anyway i'll do some more research :) so, i guess i will start with seeing how many pts ive eaten! im still trying my best to learn portioning as well... thats been a big problem for my lazy ass. always!  breakfast: 1 apple & 1 glass of cranberry juice = 2.5pts lunch: 1 slice of bread with 2 slices of turkey = 2pts snack: 1 glass of drink yoghurt = 1.5pts dinner: small steak (about 130g?)  100g oven fries with vinegar &salt, spinach salad with apple &amp; 2 tbsp honey apple vinaigarette.   hmmmm......   thats 4pts for the fries, 0 for vinegar & salt... 0 for spinach, 2 for the vinaigrette, 0.5 for the apple... aaanndddd  i think about 3 for the small steak!  so  =  9.5pts for dinner movie snack:  4 oreos = 4pts 1 glass skim milk=1pt   6 cups airpopped popcorn = 2.5pt  1 tbsp butter = 3pt. seasoning = 0  caffeine free diet coke = 0  there. i had 24.5  thats too far under....   maybe i could make extra popcorn?? makes it 26pts. hmmmm 2 extra.  oh! i'll have a kiwi  for 1pt  aanndddd ummm that makes it 27! thats pretty damn close, not bad for a first day!  although since i only have popcorn  like twice a week and only have movie snacks once a week i'll have to eat A LOT of fruit and such during the week to make up those extra points! no worries though it will all work out! im feeling confident it will... not overly confident that always ended in disaster in the past but im doing alright! now off to grill that steak!  steak au poivre! easypeasy :)

      well, here we are again.  WW for the third and final time, the only plan ive found that i can do forever & actually works for my situation. i would love to use the flexpoints plan but its not available here so i will do what i can to the best of my understanding of flexpoints! last time i did this was with winning points and i lost about 20lb (i had more than that to lose but those 20lb took me a whole year so lets not get into that)  im at 104.5kg (230lb - 16.5st?) while just a week ago i was 227 (103kg - 16st) 3lb in 1 week, surely ive gained more than that in the past but its still a shock from time to time :)  lets see. stats. im 23, 230lb, 5'7" although i think ive shrunken to 5'5!! no no, lets keep it at 5'7.  i know nothing about how to make these blogs my own, put sidebars in &amp; add links and all those fun things that everyone in the universe seems to be able to do... which is ok, im no computer genius. im married to one but i am in no way computer savvy. i have no kids & plan to keep it that way, my cats are my babies &amp; eventually my dogs will be too!  the first time i went on WW was in 2000, i weighed 198lb which i got too by going on herbalife when i was 187lb. i used to be 150lb -- actually not too long ago, 5 years actually. then after high school i moved on and got a job in a movie theatre. MISTAKE. gained 30lb there, no exercise, cheap theatre food, late night drinks... i also smoked like a chimney. sometimes 2 packs a day ( i quit jan 2, 2002) so i started popping diet pills -- knew nothing about nutrition, what good eating was about, so it was a downhill process. the second time i went on WW was 2002... i got the cd rom, its all in dutch & the dutch systems are different, i dont like it as much.  so here we are today! 80lb to go! well 75, i will see how i feel at 155 then if i choose to, will go on to 150.  who knows, maybe i will bow down to society and push myself to 125lb?? NAH screw them, they can keep their ideals. ive always been confident &amp; secure in my own flesh, even now. i just dont like the bigger clothes. theres nothing cute & sassy here like old navy or lane bryant or anything along those lines (i am Canadian living in The Netherlands) and of course Europe is known for fashion... if you are 8 feet tall and 100lb. i find the occasional cute thing which i buy in every colour &amp; jeans have never been a problem. but i long for fashion that doesnt come in my size. amongst other things, i want to be healthy again! well i wasnt fit at 150lb so that will be different this time around. i want to ski with ease, burning lungs are NOT my friend.  anyway, thats enough blabbing for 1 post, i need to get on with the program! get things sorted &amp; started. flex points. do share... everything you can. tips, suggestions. anything, im like a sponge, i suck up information! without the smelly spongy thing those sponges have going on :)

      im no perfect weight watcher, i dont know many people who are... everyone has their ups and downs but ultimately we all strive for our goals in the end despite the obstacles that pop up along the way. now maybe i havent quite understood the whole flexpoint thing...  maybe someone can help me out here? my pt target being 28  and having 35 Fpts for the week which means on average 5 per day to play with IF its necessary. is it that IF that im getting wrong? are those points just mostly for decoration and educated guesses when it comes to dishes weve never encountered before? if we do in fact eat all 35 of those points through the week does that mean we maintain? gain? i was sure that even with the extras a loss must still happen.... otherwise why would they come up with a plan like this?  anyway,  why does this happen... you all know what im talking about, you sit down in the morning with your breaky and write out a meal plan for the day and vow to stick to it letter for letter and it might be 2 or 3 points under your target? well come evening time you say 'well i still have a couple pts left' so you go on to eat them and a few more?! what is this about? is this just my PMS madness? it happened almost everyday this week! (my week starts at weigh in sat. morning- ) even last night. i said ok i will not eat anything after this salmon dinner because i wont need it! i started to get antsy and needing something, its almost like my body was screaming for protein again -- its a common occurrance come this time of the month. so i had some bread with peanut butter - 12 points worth! WHY is peanut butter so high? jeez. anyway, then later on i had some plain lowfat yoghurt with a small handfull of mixed nuts & dried fruits. ok sometimes i feel this behaviour justified because 1- im in the week up to my period. 2- im not bingeing on chocolate, chips, fries, fatty meats, take outs, candies etcetcetc. its just regular healthy food. of course, that doesnt change the fact i take in more than i PLAN on taking in. i planned on 23pts (ok, still under my 28 target but i felt it ok because i had some flexpoints the night before) yet ended up eating 33.5 which is 5.5 of my Fpts right there.  well, i suppose only the scale will tell the truth and that will be saturday morning. im still strangely positive about the whole thing despite feeling bloated and the beginning twinge of cramps. i just feel a wee bit lighter... albeit bloated and fat ... but lighter nonetheless.  *sigh* whats a woman to do?  oh! i did get 804 steps yesterday... nothing close to my former glory of 1500 but im working on it :)  im still proud of my progress thats for sure!

      so yesterday i mentioned some differences ive noticed between the flexplan and the dutch plan (points plus) hummus is 1 of my favourite things, when i make it i keep it smooth, spicy & very garlicky. minimal added points. i add a couple TBSP of plain lowfat yoghurt, lemon juice, 5+ cloves of garlic, cayenne pepper &amp; a squiggle of sesame oil because i cant find tahini here. so in all thats 1.5pt added to the chickpeas. i grabbed a can of chickpeas out of the pantry and entered the values. cals, fat, fibre. before i added the fibre into my flexpoints calculator it was 7pts (which would make just over 1cup of hummus) but low and behold because of the high fibre content (14+g per can) i ended up with 4points. so add the extras and i have a 5.5pt lunch with a ton of raw veggies which fills me up for 5+ hours im in such ecstasy right now over this that i cant even sit still. i was counting it as 4pt before and then after reaslising a whole can went into the hummus that i thought i would never be able to eat it anymore because the point value would be too high YAY FOR FLEXPOINTS! im so thrilled its only 5.5pts for a lunch thats SO filling and so incredibly healthy -- garlic is the best thing in the world, next to chocolate but of course chocolate & chickpease doesnt sound overly appetizing :) so! i shall go on to eat at least 2 days of hummus per week becuase 1- its my favourite and 2- a ton of garlic means never being sick. and i hate being sick. i was sick A LOT in high school. in 2003-today i was sick for a grand total of 3 days. thank you healthy food! i do love you!  oh, another fantabulous issue... i not only reached, but exceeded my step goal! i made 1,503 steps yesterday! thats 0.75km... and i shook the damn thing to see how far i needed to get to reach 1km and it was 2000 steps. still a ways off then but i now know that jumping around while i prepare meals &amp; marching -- especially after drinking a lot--back and forth from the bathroom to the living room certainly helps! im very pleased with this, yes indeedy.  so todays menu goes as follows  breakfast: fruit'fibre, all bran plus & skim milk = 3pts lunch: tomato toast (thick slices of tomato on 2 slices toast sprinkled with salt &amp; pepper), tea with honey, apple = 3.5pts snack: 1 boiled egg on toast = 3pts snack: plain lowfat yoghurt, honey & 1 chopped nectarine mixed in = 2.5pts dinner: 1 salmon filet baked with tomato sauce &amp; grated parmesan, veggie salad with vinaigrette = 9pts snack: 1/2glass cranberry juice, celery - 1 stalk with tbsp pb. 1 stalk with tbsp philly light = 4pts  total: 23pts .. i think this is alright because ive used 11.5 flexpoints already this week, its good to find a balance from time to time especially since the more flexpoints i use the less weight i seem to lose. lets just go on that theory for now :)  im hoping autumn is on its way, i do miss the beautiful colours and crisp cool air... i long to be breathing it in, walking through the forest without the threat of a bazillion bugs &amp; scorching sun. oh how i long for autumn... winter... i wonder what we are doing for our anniversary this year. last year we went away for our anniversary (dec. 20) and spent the x-mas week in a cottage. it was nice but i dont think we will be able to afford that this year since our main goal is saving to move back to Canada a.s.a.p. i do miss my Island, i do i do (Vancouver island -- i do lurrrrve Vancouver yesyesyes its the bestbestbest) LOL anyway.... off to make lunch before i get so hungry i eat one of the cats.

      i know that this is the day i step on the scale to decide what to change depending on which way the number has headed BUT ive also decided its not really necessary anymore.  Maybe it's because i stepped on this morning to see a +400g problem or maybe its because ive been thinking about this for a couple days and it honestly seems unnecessary? maybe its a bit of both!  Either way im +400g despite staying in my points everyday like last week. last night i did eat 7.5FP but i should still be losing even if i get all 35 in the week right? anyway, somethings not right and i decided to do some research, this is what i found.  1. the dutch program says 1 pizza is 14pts. the american says 1/2 pizza for 16pts  2. the dutch program says unlimited potatoes for 2pts. the american says 2pts per potato. 3. the dutch program says fruit is 0pts (except bananas, grapes, plums etc. for about 1pt each, plums are 3 for 1pt) the american says 1pt per fruit period, 2 for bananas. 4. the dutch says 4pt for 1cup hummus. the american says 4pt for 1 cup CHICKPEAS (1 cup of hummus can be 1 whole can of chickpeas) 5. the dutch says 11 pts for 1 restaurant portion of grilled spare ribs.  the american says 8pts for 4 single ribs. 6. the dutch says 1 muffin is 4pts.  i dont know how many they are in flexpoints, i havent finished researching yet.  so, the list goes on but you see i have to switch my thinking to the american flexpoints completely... the whole year the dutch program has been ingrained in me -- which wont be easy to change-- could be causing me problems on my new plan. considering i didnt lose more than 20lb on the dutch plan anyway.. its a wonder how any of the dutch people lose weight. well of course they never need to lose more than 20-30lbs anyway so its probably not a huge issue for them. i need to go home to Vancouver and everything will be perfect, i dont want to be here anymore everything is WRONG! hehe i just need to go. period. Marcel has said if i can secure a job then he would let me go... i suppose i can try to do that, i did all the calculations for living expenses &amp; saving for a house etc. and i would need to make about 500$ per week (canadian) to get where i want to be... it shouldnt be overly difficult to find except for the fact that i have no training, no experience and no degrees. im a grade 13 grad and thats about as far as it goes. im open to any training programs of course i just dont know what i want yet. what 23 year old does. unless they are freaks like my husband whos known what hes wanted since he was 7 yrs old.  anyway, rant done. im going to REALLY go for 1,000 steps today! wish me luck. and 28pts, no exceeding. if i get a horrible pms craving to eat a loaf of bread in 1 sitting i will chug bottle after bottle of water until im completely water logged and have to roll myself to the bathroom :) i suppose i wont be losing 5lb this week to reach my first goal but i WILL lose those 5lb eventually, just not on the date that i planned. does anything ever go to plan anyway?? please, if someone out there has met EVERY single goal ON the exact date they planned it then kept it off forever, do message me! id love to hear your story because you are not even remotely normal and im all for meeting people whove accomplished awesome feats of absolute perfection.

      im about to crash into sleep any second yet felt compelled to come & write something quickly before doing so. some sort of update perhaps? well today i got to 706 steps which is closer to 1,000 but still not close enough... i'll get there i KNOW i will!! also feeling incredible cravings but not being hungry is making me feel crazy. i just want this week to be OVER! ive eaten ....   i have to count.  1 boiled egg on toast,1 glass cranberry juice =5 glass milk & nesquick = 2 1 cup homemade hummus, raw veggies = 4 prawn pasta (1 cup prawns, 1 cup pasta, tbsp sauce, tsp olive oil)  1 cup raw veggie salad with bits of apple, nectarine, olive & feta = 9 6 1pt cookies = 6 popcorn with butter &amp; seasoning = 5 1 can diet coke = 0 2 small slices bread, 1 with crunchy peanut butter, 1 with philly light = 4.5  total: 35.5  of 28  which means i used  7.5 flex points!  wow 25.5 flex points for the rest of the week since i used 2 yesterday...    i didnt want to use more than 10 per week since thats what happened week 1 and i lost almost 4lb  2nd week used every single flexpt and lost nothing. im not sure if thats it completely but we will see!  you bite it you write it.   i read that somewhere and its helping me be accountable. all this honestly, how am i going to handle it? :-$  anyway, off to call mum then to shower with M.  then to crawl into bed with him!  nightynight xox

      since jounrnalling is not helping and im about to rip my house apart with my claws i thought it would be a nice distraction to come here and type. typing is an excellent distraction, even if theres nothing specific to write about. i made cookies. easy cookies. with oatmeal and chocolate powder & skim milk. htey are 1pt each and waiting in the freezer till tomorrow. i managed to eat only 1 before they made it to the freezer and i consider that no small feat. ive been popping maltesers for quite a while now, thankfully only 4pts per bag and i can manage to make 1 bag last all night long if i keep it in the pantry and only run to the bag for a few pieces at a time. ACK ive eaten a bunch of bread, i think 4 slices. maybe it was 6? i will say 6 just because actually eating less and recording more is better than the other way around. I NEED TO MUNCH i cant stop sweating and its not even hot. i just checked my pedometer and i have exactly 397 steps since i put it on this morning. ive been marching a lot around the house to try my best to get too 1,000 steps. overal? its not going as well as i would like. im tempted to shake the little bastard until it hits 1,000 so i can sit peacefully for the evening. i DONTwant to cook. i just want to eat bread...  ive recorded 9pts for dinner (chili garlic prawn pasta)  but what if i just ate 9pts in bread instead? *whine* i dont want to be in this body rightnow...  i just wanna dip my maltesers into the crunchy peanutbutter then go right to bed and sleep for 14 hours straight. no. i want to sleep until my period is OVER completely over! i remember sitting in a favourite bar back in highschool drinking with my girlfriends and we would talk about how great it would be if having our periods meant we just had to sit on a toilet for about 2 hours then be done for the month. how GREAT would that be?  none of this week long PMS then another week of cramps, aching backs & legs, headaches, messy gross irritation.  i just hate everything right now but i'm doing my best to not eat a whole jar of peanut butter then all the cookies & all the bread &amp; all the candy on marcels desk (which i dont usually touch, im not a candy person all that much)  ARGH FRUSTRATION!  k.  rant over.  im going to march around some more, maybe its just pent up nervous energy - yeah, right. i wish.

      its good to plan ahead.  yesterday i sat down and wrote daily meal plans for today, monday & tuesday.  tuesday i will carry on with the rest of the week. its hard to believe im actually going to start exercising...  i honestly despise it but im in lust with how it makes me feel after im finished. getting going is usually my greatest battle and hopefully iwth this pedometer it will help encourage me.  im still figuring out out hte best sensitivity because it either works too well and i end up with more steps than i took or not sensitive so i end up wiht say 11 steps when ive taken 25.   so its still a work in progress. right now im going to enjoy my casual sunday by taking a looooong hot shower, reading outside on the balcony then later in the evening very possibly going for a walk!  im going to list my food plan for the day because i feel like it :)  breakfast: 2 slices of toast with jam, 1 glass cranberry juice, cup of coffee with milk & sugar = 6pts snack: glass of skim milk with nesquick = 2pts lunch: tuna sarnie (1/2cup tuna, tbsp plain lowfat yoghurt, diced pickles on 2 slices toast) = 6pts snack: glass of skim milk with nesquick = 2pts dinner: subway 6" turkey on whole wheat with all veggies, extra jalapenos, no sauce. 1 oatmeal raisin cookie,  1 can diet coke = 10pts (5.5for sub,  4.5 for cookie)  snack: glass skim milk with nesquick = 2pts  total: 28pts!  not normally as much fruit as i would like but 1 glass of cranberry juice counts as 2 servings of fruit so i guess its not too bad.   and i got 3 glass of milk! WOOHOO!   oh, if anyones wondering why i put nesquick in my milk its because i was raised on powdered milk and forced to drink it even though i hated it (gagged my way through at least 1 glass everyday -- thanks a bundle ex-stepfather)  so since then ive absolutely hated the taste of ALL milk and can only drink it with a small spoonfull of chocolate powder, and even then i have to chug it!  i hate milk but i hate the thought of brittle bones more so i do my best and if that means using 3extra points per day just for 1 small spoonfull of nesquick per glass (3 glasses per day)  then so be it :)

      i love spiffy new toys, dont you? well ive been thinking of ways to get exercise into my day and a pedometer always seemed like an excellent way for a couch potato like myself... so, i did some research and decided on the omron fit bug pro. well, out to the store lalala no omron! ok, so M. decided the next best thing would be the oregon scientific PE316PM and i love it... its small & kidney shaped, a funky turqiois colour, it has pulse control (a little strap thingy you stick your finger in, it takes your pulse, clever little thing) and as long as you find the right sensitivity for you it can be quite accurate -- im still trying to figure that out... on the least sensitive i can dance in my chair as i usually do and it doesnt seem to have too much effect on the little thing! the only really sucky thing is how hard it is to open, the grated button has made my thunb raw &amp; red but other than that i have zero complaints! its so small and light i dont even know its there. it doesnt fall off when i go to the bathroom & it has everything from distance travelled, steps travelled, calories burned -- you should input your weight. and they have a little maths key in the instructions on how to determine what your stride is so you can run with it walk with it, whatever you want! all the way up to a 135cm stride which i assume is flat out running or for a reeeeaaalllyyyy tall person since my stride is about 45cm (im a slow walker though so that might also have something to do with it ) so yes! im quite happy! after searching around they say you should aim for 10,000 steps per day. today is my trial day, im going to see how many steps i average (not much im sure) and then work my way up! itll be quite a motivation to see the number and push myself an extra 500 steps just to be proud of an accomplishment, ive always been a very visual person. graphs, charts, numbers! i love it all. so we will see how things progress in the next week or so!  also i reviewed my eating journal the past couple weeks and i noticed a few things. when i lost 1.4kg i was eating between 26-28pts per day and didnt eat more than 8flex points. this week when i lost nothing i was sometimes eating 16pts &amp; ate 33 flexpoints in total. also before i was drinking 3 glasses of milk per day and 1 full glass of cranberry juice while this week i managed 100g of yoghurt & a bit of milk in my cereal &amp; 1/5 glass of cranberry juice at best (i use cranberry juice to get my daily vitamin c allowance, its very high) also this week i ate SO much fibre but didnt drink nearly as much water so i think that posed a teency problem on more than 1 occassion. i'll spare you the dirty details ;)  this weeks goals  1. check steps & do my best to start out to 5,000 steps (its a good start, half of t' recommended) 2. drink 3 glasses of milk per day 3. drink 1 FULL glass of cranberry juice per day 4. get some fresh air at least once 5. go easy on the fibre rich cereals &amp; when i do, be sure to drink at least 1 extra bottle of water on that day.  there. i think those are perfectly achievable goals & considering my period is due in 6 days i have to be sure to eat regularly... not too long between meals or i will get uber bitchy &amp; ravenous and want to eat the world in 3 bites.   *****UPDATE*****  im taking off the pedometer for the day... ive walked 328 steps! i clearly have a lot of work to do to reach my first goal of 5,000 steps. maybe i should start with 1,000 LOL

      after chatting with E.  she made some very valid points about me not weighing this week because my periods due in exactly 6 days and im feeling fat and crummy overall  but i decided i need to be an adult and face the music so i stepped on the scale this morning. not a single thing lost, not a single thing gained. i stayed EXACTLY the same. the numbers didnt even flash up or down for a second. 3 times stepping on gave me the exact same number everytime. so thats that. my plan of losing 2.5lb this week did not work despite doing everything right & having 2 flexpoints left over. im not sure how i will manage to meet my 222.5lb goal by next weekend because thats 5lb, i just wasnt counting on this to happen but i suppose when it comes to a lifelong weight changing decision a woman must be prepared for these times along the way. so, no hard feelings.  i thought maybe it was because i ate almost all my flexpoints while last week i didnt eat a single one. or did i??? i would have to read back to find out. maybe i ate about 8 but certainly not 33. so this week i will make an effor to eat many more veggies & again, when im hungry not according to schedule. i hate eating on a schedule, i'll just eat when im hungry. that seems to work best. also continue on with my portion control because im feeling very good about my progress in that area. my measuring cup is my favourite thing these days. i havent used the scale in ages, this works perfectly. 1 cup of cooked meat/fish, 1 cup of cooked pasta or rice or couscous, 2 cups of salad.  yes, im loving it indeed! :D  well, ive decided the greatest problem right now is my lack of exercise. i want to get a pedometer & see how many steps (km's) i make on a regular day then just go from there. im sure it will also be motivation to move more.  so i'll wear it to the gym when i go on the treadmill together with my heart monitor and keep my heart rate in fatburning zone about 150-155 . well the thoughts are all jumbled in my brain so im going away to think about it some more and figure out what im trying to say :)  happy saturday! movie day! woohooo! i dont feel like eating anything particular this evening so i probably wont eat at all -- movie snack that is, usually its a very specific craving, right now im not having anything at all so i'll leave it at that. ciao darlings xox

      well not too many as im alotted 35per week.  flexpoints that is... but i used 15 last night. met my 28pt target then went 15fp in. i see ive written down that i ate the leftover noodles from dinner, a couple pancakes, 1 slice more of bread than i planned. and 8pts in nutella which i really didnt want but its the only chocolate in the house other than my nesquick. of course after M. saw me getting into that he sneakily disposed of the nutella while i was in the shower. maybe he just knows me better than i know myself. again, this ongoing struggle with being honest to myself & everyone else is taking its toll and i feel im slowly going slightly insane.  i suppose slightly is better than fully.  isnt it?  please? someone?  *squeak*  really though, im not doing terribly, perfectly within my point range &amp; flexpoint range, i have 2 for today IF i need them... im veryvery curious to see the number on the scale tomorrow because as id planned on a 1.5lb loss i highly doubt that happened especially considering what i saw on wednesday! and even despite me doing everything right with tracking every morsel & accounting for EVERYTHING its a tad frustrating if it happens that way but all i can do is stay positive and if the scale doesnt show me what i want to see then buckle down, ignore the heat and get my ass on a bike.... or the treadmill. today im going for a walk since its dark and rainy, windy and cool.  the perfect weather for walking on the treadmill!!!  :)  although, if there is no loss or a gain even, i will be quite mad because i did do everything right AND it is only my 2nd weigh in since beginning! its supposed to go so easily in the beginning. i refuse to lose 200g per week ... i wont do that again, i cant, i will end up on medication and bouncing off padded walls at the funnyfarm.  see, please. tell me what is wrong with this  ***Update... after reading around a lot of weightwatchers places, ive realised that going under 28pts despite using all of my flexpoints, really is not a good idea, ive tweaked it to make my 28pt daily target.  breakfast: allbran plus (0) fruit&amp;fibre (2) skim milk (1) orange juice (1.5) = 4.5 lunch: 1 cup homemade hummus (4) raw veggies (0)  cup of tea (0) = 4 snack: 1apple (1) snack: yoghurt (1)  blueberries (0.5) honey (0.5) = 2 dinner: 1 cup couscous (3) prawns (3) raw veggie salad with olives & feta (2) = 8 snack: 2 cups cubed watermelon = 2  ADDED: 6cups popcorn &amp; almost 2tbsp butter = 6.5pts NEW total: 28pts!  total: 21.5pts yes im aware my target is 28 but i ate 17fp over last night! icant bring myself to eat more... maybe ill have a glass of milk with my watermelon... im just too frazzled over this, i need to relax a little. i feel the threads of angst in my stomach and its not pleasant! i dont want to fall down this hole again.

      i did have one yesterday... it was most unpleasant.  despite it being our anniversary i just wanted to be alone & was happy M. was out almost all day doing his computer thing, getting it all organised and ready to be sold etc. i broke down more than a couple times, had moments of utterly dramatic despair...  felt like nothing in the world would ever allow me to lose weight, i would be stuck in this country forever, we would be homeless.. you name it i thought it.   thankfully today the PMS monster has left, im doing much better & by the time dinner rolled around last night i was much better &amp; able to enjoy our anniversary with M. without dragging the whole mood down into my puddle of misery. so now all is well with the world, that brief pms encounter was just a preview of rocky days to come which im REALLY not looking forward too but hey, its something ive got to deal with every month so COMEON lets get it over with!!!!!!!  today with some planning & a very clear idea of what i wanted to eat for dinner, i was able to hit my 28pt mark without any problem!  i always feel proud & angsty at the same time when i do that. proud because im doing what im supposed to be doing. angsty because it feels like if i dont lower my intake at least 1 pt per week i will never, in a million years, lose any weight which is bloody ridiculous but i cant help thinking it, the destructive thoughts just squeeze into my head unnoticed...  i think my inner fat girl is trying to get revenge for me wanting to lose weight. shes trying to sabotage my progress...   i wanted to lose 1kg this week but something tells me its going to be more like 200g  despite me being completely honest, tracking every single morsel & still having 19flex points left over PLUS 1 whole activity point.   sometimes i just dont get it. but i will keep at it.   ALTHOUGH if doing this the right way i fall back into that measly 200g per weekpattern i did while i was lying & cheating my way through before, im going to be THOROUGHLY pissed off and self hating &amp; want to give up in the end.  *sigh* seems the monster is sneaking in... im going to leave while im still in one piece....

      as i mentioned, i do love a lot of healthy foods and although the drool factor is not AS high its still pretty high because these things can be damn tasty...  Favourites  Fruit: mango, all varities of melon, peaches, nectarines, apples, kiwis, all varities of berries especially raspberries, mandarines, grapes (purple more so than green), bananas. basically its safe to say if its a fruit i will indeed love it .... except figs... they freak me out for some reason.  veggies: if its raw, cold, clean & fresh i will love it. if its a veggie that must be cooked to be eaten i usually dont like it. i love tomatoes, cucumber, all peppers, carrots, fresh peas in the pod, spinach, most lettuce except iceburg, broccoli, celery, radishes,alfalfa... it would probably just be easier to say : if its cooked, i will hate it :)  fish:  if its fresh &amp; from the sea its all good...   im not a fan of saltwater fish with the exception of rainbow trout.  well i do love a lot of healthy foods but im not that great at thinking of them right now...  hummus is great! i love it....  anyway, today is validation wednesday and im exactly the same as i was on saturday which means that 700g i lost by monday must have been the dehydration (i dont usually drink anything on sundays, its a bad habit im trying to fix) combined with the super salty meal i had last night im still positive there will be a loss come saturday!!  last night i was so desperate for protein it was unreal!!! i managed to eat 28pts for dinner alone, i had 2 pieces of cevapcici & 1 large pattie... that combined with the 2 big handfuls of fries &amp; the tzatziki sauce i raked in 28pts using 11 flexpoints for the day.  i think the most important thing is im actually being honest about it & recording/tracking everything. just 6 months ago i would have ignored half of what i ate &amp; not recorded it AT ALL because, well, if i cant see it written down & people dont know about it then it obviously didnt happen. i hated it about myself &amp; dont want to be like that anymore. ive changed a lot in the past 2 months, i just feel... raw... if that makes any sense. its difficult to explain, maybe the best way would be to say im evolving and im in a raw stage right now and instead of lying and medicating myself im trying to be honest & accountable for everything. ive journaled more in the past few weeks than i have in my entire life it feels. i have 2 online journals &amp; 2 paper journals. not to mention talking to people outright like ive never done before.  its a process.

      on the weightloss front im doing alright! im doing a challenge now to meet my 28pts everyday!! yes, very important and today ive met it! feels good to do that although i feel a little sceptical that any losses will happen because ive eaten under for so long :-$ damn im so paranoid sometimes. and its an unfounded paranoia, everything will go well! yes! it will all be fine.  today i wanted to list some of my favourites... junk food specifically. what i eat when things arent going well. maybe by seeing this list as one big pile of junk i will be more careful about ever overdosing again, that is the plan anyway.  favourites  icecream!! ben & jerrys' cherry garcia.  haagen daazs' vanilla swiss almond. baskin robbins' maui brownie madness. i also love chocolate chip mint from most brands &amp; any icecream sandwich will do. when i was about 13 i would devour the oreo cookie icecream sandwiches, about 1 per day they were HUGE. of course, i was skinny back then :-P  popcorn!! of course, ANY popcorn will do but theatre popcorn is my favourite. as well as the white cheddar popcorn from the grocery store  waffels!! again, any cakey thick waffels.  i love them blegian style with high piles of whipped cream.  KFC! i eat the skin off the extra crispy and throw the chicken away, then i'll eat a whole tub of gravy with the fries.   FRIED things onion rings (anything onion & deep fried) deep fried prawns, fries--poutine with lots of gravy, the chinese pork balls with sweet &amp; sour sauce  cookies! anything soft& chewy was a comfort to eat.  my fave was chewy chips ahoy &amp; soft chewy oatmeal raisin.  *k starting to strain to think of things now....   chocolate.  of course this is a given but more of an indulgence than a binge, i love really nice bonbons & truffels.  fudge.  not a common occurance but i did love a bite or 2 of good quality tasty fudge.  pizza. lots of toppings, extra cheese. i did this about twice a week. sometimes more since where i worked i got a huge staff discount &amp; it was cheaper than buying groceries.  doritos/chips type things. the cool ranch flavour is my fave, i also loved ketchup lays and salt & vinegar and i vaguely remember a crunchy ring of sorts... an onion flavoured ring chip type thing. i did buy those quite often but cant really remember them. oh and real canadian cheezies. those were a HUGE weakness of mine. they gave me the worst heartburn but i loved them.   ok. i think that about covers it. reading back over the list its almost embarrasing but i must realise that i didnt eat all those things in 1 sitting. it really doesnt make it any easier though... i feel like a huge porker, in a funny way :)  when it came to restaurants i loved the Keg, the steak &amp; lobster. i would leave my steak & order a second lobster half :) then maybe a few bites of salad but id usually be too full after the whole lobster. i loved olive garden. i just love all italian food, we'll leave that at that. i loved chinese restaurants because of the fried foods, i loved japanese restaurants for the sushi, i loved vietnamese restaurants because i love vietnamese food.... sometimes i loved to eat a hamburger from mcdonalds! with a shake! and usually an apple pie becuase i loved those crispy warm little apple pies!  sometimes i would buy a whole box of tim hortons timbits and eat them in the dark of my bedroom after work. sometimes i would sit in tim hortons drinking 1 cup of coffee after another eating my favourites - bear claw, long john &amp; old fashioned cake donut. occassionally with a lemon jelly wiht the white powder.  i would smoke 1 pack after the other of matinee extra lights, dipping my hand into a big box of quaker granola cereal at 4 am while i chatted away on my computer.  i knew nothing of nutrition, portion control or felt the need to have self control in teh slightest.  oh well, those days are over... its not even nice to think back to how unhealthy i was. im going to have some tomato toast &amp; watermelon for lunch now :) tomorrow i will counter this with my favourite healthier choices these days!

      well, i guess that would be me wouldnt it? yes. the horribly awful slacker that is me. no excuse, i just havent reached it! yesterday anyway. yesterday after planning dinner and everything i ended up with a grand total of 12 (of 28) soooo i thought of different ways to increase that! oh! oven fries instead of rice! thats 2 extra, i will bread my fish! thats another 1pt, use an eggwhitwash first!!! 0.5pt OOOO and a dollop of ketchup for my fries! another 0.5! so i actually ended up with 16 instead of 12 which isnt the best improvement but its a start. actually, i didnt finish all my fish *sigh*  another day though! today is that! another day indeed!!! and so far i have 14pts which leaves 14 free for dinner because these days in the heat when nothing is clean and turning on the oven or stove increases the apartment temp no less than 10 degrees its awwwwful. so! dinner is actually a spure of the moment thing. so with 14 dinner pts available thats enough for a pizza! or what have you... it probably wont be pizza because wednesday is pizza day -- pizzas are 5.50 euros on those days :D cheaper yet would be frozen pizzas in the oven, but weve tried that and they just arent as tasty and satisfying as the italian style deli pizzas! i love me some margherita. rowr. this wed. i will ask for a margherita with pineapple!!! last week was funghi maybe i can convince them im worth some pineapple YUM.  anyway enough rambling about pizza.....  overal its just been great for staying on plan these days... my pill packet says the PMS monster is due to rear its ugly head in the next week and a half or so, im not looking forward to it but i will do my best to accomodate whatever mad crazy craving is thrown my way.  also, i stepped on the scale this morning out of sleepy curiosity and im down another 1.5lb since saturday... of course nothing is official until saturday but im pretty positive, as always!

      yes, its that time... and i think yesterday seeing 102.9kg  and thinking id be even lower today was  a TOUCH enthousiastic, even i must admit that. hoping for a 5lb weight loss in week 1 may seem doable for the average 230lb fat girl but usually its water weight. and since i drink 2+ litres per day it was not highly likely to have been my case so i must confess, i am THRILLED to announce a 3.62lb weight loss for week 1.  not bad,  not bad at all!! its the most ive ever lost in 1 week EVER which makes me quite happy :) i have only 3.88lb to go before i hit goal #1  of 222.5lb  which i want to make BEFORE weekend after next but know by next weekend isnt too realistic. yes, im feeling quite positive indeed! Marcel is happy for me he just wants me to keep my goals realistic which im trying hard to do.  3.88lb in 2 weeks is realistic isnt it?? almost 2lb per week?  i think its quite doable ...  the PMS monster is not due to hit for another week or 2 anyway so i feel secure & safe in my goal setting!  so a recap on the week....  i stayed within my points everyday, sometimes being a teency bit under but trying to compensate with milk or juice here &amp; there. i used 8 of my flexpoints, leaving 27 over which is alright in my book. i tracked every meal in my notebook, did my best to compensate for the heat & lack of wanting to cook -- one day we had mcdonalds.... i got a grilled chicken salad &amp; used only 1/4 of the dressing -- the amount of dressing in those packets is phenomenal!!!! id like to TASTE my salad thank you very much, not drown it.   it was tasty & satisfying &amp; had lots of veggies!  so while M. had 2 mcchickens & a mcolympic greek whatever it was, i stuck to my salad &amp; then we shared a couple wee donuts!  it was wonderful!  gilette satin care melon splash shaving gel.... dont eat it no matter how good it smells and it smells like candy...  like it belongs wrapped in bubbalicious paper   i leave you on that note.

      so tired... oh so so tired.  i cannot explain the feeling of exhaustion taking over my body.  its overwhelming! i lay awake until 2 or 3am then finally doze off, wanting to awake at 8 so the cycle doesnt continue. but i cant uncement my eyelids until 10! unbelievable. not that this has much to do with weightloss. well, maybe it does because come autumn/winter, im awake a lot more & therefore have many more hours in the day to contemplate food. summer just drains me completely, its very very unpleasant. its at least 80 celsius here today it must be! i cant imagine it being cooler than that :P anyway, enough complaining about the weather!  im looking forward to weigh in tomorrow, i think about a 5lb loss maybe more is on the table and im going to celebrate with some caffeine free diet coke. yes, maybe even TWO cans! im such a rebel.  my eating has been a little wonky lately i suspect because of the heat... i have no energy, no appetite.. everything is just BLAH but im getting my 2 litres of water so im pretty sure those pounds lost is not water weight. even when i started losing weight for the very first time ever about 3 years ago, i never lost that famed water weight everyone talks about... back then i was drinking 4 litres of water a day. of course i realise now i was really crazy back then and should pay no attention to those fanatic type habits.  today i made my points to 27.5! yipee! this is getting easier! still 0.5pt under but i might have some melon slices after dinner which should compensate.  when the weather cools down i want to start making exercise goals... i hate exercise *whine* but i have a gym membership thats good till about april i think &amp; its costing 55 euros a month... i could freeze the account but they wont allow it for less than 3months at a time. and well, it'd better not be that hot for that much longer or im moving to the arctic.  so today i had a fab lunch, light & simple, low in points and utterly delicious especially with the heat! 4tbsp lowfat yoghurt, 1/2cup frozen blueberries. squirt of honey. 2pts. frozen yummy goodness ohhh it was fantastic. when i make frozen yoghurt i would throw those ingreds. into a food processor but that would have taken time which meant standing sweating in the kitchen which just didnt appeal, so i ate it like that! delish!  so if i tell you a secret, promise not to tell? ok then i stepped on the scale this morning. honestly i thought it was saturday ... THATS how tired i am and it wasnt until Marcel came home that i realised it was friday because he had some internet installation to do on friday. PHEW so anyway, the scale said 102.9kg which is 226.38 lbs which means 3.62lb lost since saturday. im very pleased! and thats why im pretty sure i'll be almost 5lb down come tomorrow morning!  such a great boost for the beginning of the journey. i'll be soooo happy to be 155lb again, honestly! and there is only 71.38lb to go! i can do that! my first goal is to hit 222.5lb and i want to do that by next weigh in... not tomorrow, but the saturday after that!  yay! although my inner fatgirl is nagging me &amp; saying i will only lose weight this week because every week i have to decrease my food intake until im not eating anything at all to lose poundage. and that the only reason im losing weight now is because im not exercising and my body is eating all the muscle and eventually im not going to be able to walk from lack of muscle tissue, atrophyyyy she screams... atrophyyyyy. stupid ridiculous inner fatgirl. damn you. i will keep doing what im doing so shut up. hear me??? you will no longer have power over me or my decisions!!!!!! believe it :-P pppfflltt so there. hmph.  heh.

      mmm the silky creaminess. decadent. sensuous.  i would love a little piece right about now!  they do have fudge here but its not good and i wont eat it unless its the best and the best comes from a little place i used to know but never knew the name of!  odd, since i went there once a week for a little sample.  my mum sent M. a nice chunk of canadian maple fudge for x-mas and he loved it! i have to admit the few bites i had were exquisite indeed.  oh how i dream of the rich creamy fudginess *shudder* so sweet it burns.  just a taste. nothing more. -- i could never eat vast quantities of sweet--  chocolate is a different subject all together.  well i have to say when the fudge came to me in my dream last night i was more than happy. i swear, i could taste it when i woke up. the maple creamy wonderousness that is the maple fudge :)  ok, enough about that before i start to lose my mind.  i always said when goal weight hit (155lb) i would never ever eat any 'bad' stuff because i would not want to ruin all my efforts  but please, who am i fooling.  those things, although not required for my exsistance, are special.  and a wonderful treat from time to time.  when i was younger i would secretly buy lots of junky food with my babysitting money and sneak it into my room to eat from under my pillow in the evenings. there was a strange comfort that came along with my ritual.  being curled up on my side with a good book, sneaking chip after chip slowly out from under the blanket or pillow, trying hard not to crinkle the bag yet feeling oddly satisfied when a little crinkle came with the chip i extracted.  it was always doritos. cool ranch flavour.  if i needed something sweet it would be peanut m&ms or oreo double stuff cookies. but mostly it was the doritos.  i remember an event specifically that happened about 6 months ago? i dont remember the date exactly but i remember the event. i had purchased a bag of the cool ranch (here they are called cool american but they are still the same flavour)  to eat on saturday night while i watched my movie (bags come in 150g)  anyway, M and i had had a fight the night before, i never remember what we fight about but it was probably something petty & stupid as it usually is (although a rare occurance thankfully, i value my peace)   so after we fought, he left to do some work i grabbed my bag of cool ranch and crawled into bed with a book.   AND put the chips under the duvet cover.   im not quite sure why... i was alone. and besides, M. has worked hard to unteach my hamster behaviours because i still caught myself doing it from time to time -- that he found out about during our relationship. there was no need to hide.  so what compelled me to fall back into that pattern? i can only imagine it must have been the comfort.  *sigh*  sometimes i just dont get it.  anyway, im doing well with points. i must have used about 8 flexpoints since saturday which leaves 27 until friday night, not too bad for my first week i must admit! im quite pleased with the whole process. everything feels different this time around.  last time i lost about 19lb in 1 year (which i gained back in a matter of 2 months)  but honestly, i wasnt being true to myself or the program. i would think -- no no i'll just eat that and not count it because if it doesnt show up on paper where i & everyone can see it, then it means i didnt actually consume it.  i scoff (instransitive) at my former pathetic self.  and i never want to go back to that again, i feel very angry right now for cheating myself out of the progress i could have made.   for the summer i might have enjoyed for the first time since i moved out of Italy.   ANGRY!  i cant even talk about it.  im at boiling point and its not because of the 40degree heat enveloping me. although that certainly doesnt help.  scoff.

      yes, its wednesday. that time when i require a little midweek boost (or kick in the ass whatever the case may be) so i tend to step on the scale to see which direction my weight is going. lets just say this was certainly a boost! im at  103.3kg (227.3lb) which is a 1.2kg (2.6lb) drop from saturday. now by this time anything can happen by saturdays official weigh in but im feeling pretty positive! ive made it again today to 28pts without much trouble which is a wonderful thing!! it seems to be getting easier once im back into the swing of things! WEDNESDAY NIGHT PIZZA NIGHT ok you might be wondering (or not) why i want to have pizza when i just saw that fantastic review on the scale but honestly, thats part of my routine. and besides, i had such a horrible headache last night from teh heat that we ended up eating the pizza last night and tonight i'll make the chicken. so there, that was done and still not too much damage done. i had an italian style pizza funghi which is one of my faves. next to margherita. sure i do love american style thick crust heavily loaded pizzas from time to time but truth is its not that readily availble in my opinion as it is so much more expensive. besides, the lighter fare = the lighter bum and thats what im all about these days. and who can handle all that grease anyway? id be running to the bathroom all night long!! oh, was that one of those TMI moments? heh. anyway, its almost 13:30 i really must get my hummus made! yes, homemade hummus for lunch, with a couple cups of raw veggies!! i keep my hummus quick &amp; easy, although i dont know how it can be any other way!! 1/2cup or 1cup chickpeas (garbanzo beans) couple tbsp fatfree plain yoghurt, few ( i like 5) cloves fresh garlic, cayenne pepper, paprika, lemon juice. whizz in a food processor and VOILA tasty, filling,spicey lunch that keeps vampires away... whats not to love!?!? :D

      YAY! first day, while i was eating breaky i sat down and wrote out everything i would eat today -- a plan if you will then, after tallying up the points i hit 28! my daily target! without having to rack my brain and figure out where to add things to make it :D im very pleased with this...  breakfast: fruit'n'fibre with skim milk = 3pts snack: smoothie: instant coffee granules, bit of yoghurt, bit of milk, ice = 2pts lunch: tuna sarnie: 1/2cup tuna,1tbsp mixed mayo & yoghurt, 2 slices bread, cucumber=7pts snack: 1 3/4 cup strawberries, 1 apple = 2pts dinner: honey pineapple glazed chicken with rice, grilled pineapple rings &amp; raw veggie salad=9pts snack: 6cups popcorn, 1tbsp butter & shaking of popcorn seasoning. caffeine free diet coke = 5 pts  total: 28!!!! wooooowoooooo finally! :D i have used about 5 flexpoints since saturday, with the odd snagged oreo cookie here and there which ive written in my notebook but not mentioned here. but yes, i have indeed had an oreo here &amp; there.  im feeling pretty good! positive... of course that all usually changes when the pms monster takes over my body but hell im going to enjoy all the time i can while its not here !! i'll do my midweek validation weighin tomorrow as usual so we will see whats happened in 4 days, hopefully itll be a preview of good things to come, im definitely positive thats for sure.

      so im having a difficult time coming up with all my points for a day, even now that i count fruit as points!   i never seemed to have this problem in the past, maybe its just the heat is making me lose my appetite?  so far i have written out  breakfast: apple = 1pt brunch/lunch:  bowl of fruit'n'fibre with all-bran plus and skim milk = 4pts snack: tea with tsp honey & 1 kiwi = 1.5pts snack: 2 slices toast with thick slices tomato = 2pts dinner: 120g cooked prawns over 1 cup cooked pasta with 2tsp olive oil, dash of chili sauce &amp; herbs.  2 cups raw veggies/salad with 1tbsp apple honey vinaigrette = 9pts snack: glass of skim milk with nesquick = 2pts  total: 19.5pts  :-$  eep  thats 8.5pts under...   i could have 2 glasses of milk with nesquick, that would make my daily calcium requirement. so that adds another 2.  = 21.5pts.  ummm.  1 glass of cranberry juice will bring me to my daily vit.c requirement... thats 2pts added on. =23.5pts  hmm.  would it be terrible to stop there? i honestly dont know what else to add.... i could say i'll add another cup of pasta which would bring me to 27.5pts  but im REALLY trying to get my portion problem under control  and thats my biggest priority at the moment. 1 cup of pasta is 1 portion.  not the 2-4cups i used to indulge my lazy ass in.  i hereby pronounce myself finished for the day.  4.5pts under or  not! because i have that right and my fatbutt needs to learn what a proper portion is.  so in winter my appetite increases but i exercise like MAD as well so im hoping all this will balance . why am i so thoroughly affected by the elements. great goddess i havent a clue. but im one happy camper these days despite the heat :)

      i clearly have no idea what im doing...  and although i live with a computer genius hes not a webdesigner so he couldnt help me put the sidebar on the LEFT side.  the only other template i actually like that has the sidebar on the left im using for my other blogger page.  obligatory porridge.  well i want this page with the dewy leaves & dark green colours but the damn sidebar is on the right :P oh well,  there are greater problems in the world.  everythings going very well for my 3rd day on ww flexpts.  im enjoying it quite a bit actually! and although i would never admit this in public *shh you didnt hear it from me* im actually looking forward to doing some exercise when the weather cools down!  sure i can floor exercise in the airconditioned bliss of my living room & possibly some light cardio in the bedroom *winkwink* but my treadmill &amp; bike are in a part of the apartment that is NOT airco'd and thats well... thats just unbearable!  i have no clue what to make for dinner tonight... normally i make shellfish on mondays but 1-my kitchen is a sty because im too hot & lazy to clean it. -- poor excuse considering i have a dishwasher LOL ok ok i'll get the dishes going. but that doesnt help problem 2-lack of groceries. ok thats easily remedied but it STILL doesnt change the fact that im too lazy to cook when its hot *whine* PHEW now that ive got the whine out i feel much better and ready to cook.  yes, this is just the madness you will encounter along my journey!  once i was debating whether or not to go to the gym, i stayed in bed and whined and cried and kicked my feet for like an hour with Marcel my husband tugging on my arms & saying encouraging words.   finally i got dressed and stomped & slammed doors and pouted and whined all the way to the gym. i stayed there for 1.5hrs and had a kickass workout.    go figure.  anyway! off to get those dishes in the dishwasher!!

      this is something i used to suffer from. quite badly actually... i used to step on about 2093569824365 times per day in hopes of seeing some minor changes. of course there were changes and not just minor but i would gain like 6lb in the course of a day! *gasp* it was so pathetic.... well thankfully now iv gained some sort of realistic views of the whole scale situation and no longer have a driving need to step on so often. once a week is usually enough although i do enjoy having some validation half way through the week. weigh ins are first thing saturday morning, naked of course. yesterday i weighed in at 230lb which is almost my ultimate high point... which was 237.6 and not too far away from where i am now. although i know theres not much that can happen overnight in the form of a loss, i feel slimmer already! just the choice of getting something accomplished again... tracking my day, its so difficult to explain but that little purpose has given me a reason. i want to succeed! all the way this time. i have no halfass feelings. i want to live a normal life with activity and healthy foods and the occassional sunday night chinese or wednesday night pizza. and of course everyone has their down moments. i fully expect them to happen from time to time. i turn into a raving crazy lunatic about 4 days per month. the 3 days leading up to my period and the day after it begins. why not the day it actually begins? well that day my cramps are at their worse so i cant tell the difference between hunger pangs & period cramps so i usually end up eating about 1 slice of toast &amp; 1 cup of tea through the day. but those other 4 days? BABY WATCH OUT i will eat YOU if you are standing in front of my beloved waffels with chocolate icecream. or whatever my weird monthly craving might be. so 4 days of the month i try my best to plan accordingly & when the days hit im not lost. i plan, for example this month i wanted to OD on chocolate, NOTHING was helping. so, i stuffed a wee chocolate muffin into a bowl then scooped a couple balls of belgian double chocolate chocolate chip icecream over it then i melted a few squares of black pure 70% cocoa solid type chocolate in the microwave and poured it over. i swear, its not a lot of food but you feel SO incredibly satisfied after that you dont need chocoalte for an entire month!! which is actually the point :) anyway, my cravings vary in both intensity &amp; madness and since i have a few weeks to go i wont dwell on them!  on to other things it is still too hot to do anything so i figure even though exercise DOES help, being as tubby as i am now its possible to lose quite a bit of weight focusing just on the eating aspect. so i figure by the time it cools down i'll have lost quite a few pounds and will be ready & willing to teach myself to enjoyyyyy exercise. said with the most enthousiasm i can muster considering exercise is the bane of my exsistance. honestly. i dont hate many things but sweating is definitely one of them. unless its sauna induced... or sex. cause, well... thats just one of the fun bits!  so! considering its sunday &amp; veryvery hot im doing quite well point wise.. its 3pm and ive used 12 which is actually a typical sunday for me! so i have 16 left to use the rest of the day to make my target. M. was edging towards chinese since we still have those cupons to use. let me see how many points in babi pangang & steamed rice.... ooo 16 for a serving of both!!!! fantastic. well, it says 1 cup of sweet&amp;sour pork is 12 points which is more or less what babi pangang is except there is less than 1cup in 1 serving here. its more like 1.5cups for 2 people. i guess these charts are all about american servings? well i'll just adapt everything.. count a few less points. or have a bit more rice to even things out. i'll also have some soysauce which is 0 and some cold slices of cucumber which is 0. caffeine free diet coke is 0 also. it works out.  i need to drink more water! i used to drink 4 litres a day and had the best skin. now im lucky to make 2 litres and my skin hates me. 4 was too much though.. i'll focus on making 2 a steady habit then add half a litre so my bladder can have time to expand accordingly. because you know, a woman jumping to use the toilet every 5 minutes? not that attractive... and im ALL about being attractive. unless chocolate is involved. then its fend for yourself &amp; stay out of my way!
