						   Deck of Cards  07/12/04 Today is not like any other day...My aunt has just had her surgery; worriesome I went to see her and after I left the hospital, different images and feelings started popping up in my head. An odd thing happened also. Someone called me and said something that really shook me up. They asked me if I would be interested in getting to know this girl who they think is very suitable for me. I said without hesitation that I was not interested since I am in love with another person. The person asked me how serious is my relationship. I then said "She is the woman I have always wanted to be with". To make the story short, the person asked me if I am seeing my partner regularly...I started laughing...cause it stroke me since the last time I was in touch with her amounted to 8 days ago. Now, 8 days ago doesn't seem a lot but for someone like me in love it feels an eternity. Does this person really care about me? I know she does, but is it in her own way? how about my way? I am broke without a job and no money and I still called her many times while she is in Morocco. Since she has been gone, for 3 weeks now, she never thought of picking up the receiver and call me just to hear my voice. She sends me text messages...Great the other person said, but Karim is that really what you want?  No that is not what I want...I want to talk to her and I want to feel special...but does it really matter anyway? she always makes it seem that I should not be near sighted and I should be more resistant and less soft... I am sorrry, I am sensitive and I like to stay that way.  I try to resist the urge to make irrational decisions that I might regret forever... but her, does she ever take the time and consider how much damage she is doing to this relationship. Love was not meant to make one feel sad and desperate. It should be a relief and the sensation of "bien etre". where am I with this feeling? what is the difference between someone who has loved and lost that loved one to death and someone like me who has loved but whose partner is not actively in his life? is this love coming to an end and falling like a deck of cards? I wonder what is going to be her excuse this time... I am bitter and disapointed... what a sorry ass...I can still feel the other person on the phone trying to persuade me to reconsider the other person who seems to know me from i don't know where? but that is not what I want to do... is it reason or is it the belief that things can be fixed. I don't know...tomorrow is another day and I am currious what will it bring with it.....
