        The Monday McDo Crew -- like Jaymee, it is the BEST thing that has happened to me in college. Why? Because you guys (you know who you are!) are the only people I can talk to, and I mean  really  talk to. I can be myself around you, and you wouldn't care how cheesy or weird I am. And because of that -- I LOVE YOU GUYS!! :)

         i always believed that things happen for a reason... m just not certain what exactly the reason is.. mondaymcdo is the nicest experience that has happened to me in my freshman year.. to be able to hang out wth people with the sam interests and almost the same personalities is a really big highlight in my life.. i nvr thought i would be able to gain friends as cool and sweet as jaymee and karla... hvng them in my life means understanding my life better... if there's one thing that i would never forget, that would be having two of the nicest people in the world (or in my planet) who understand how  you feel and will always be ready to hold my hand when i need it(i'll hold their hands whenever i wnt, though...)   you guys are angels.. and i'm lucky to be your friend... i love u!!

         Hahaha. I bought the Eraserhead's greatest hits,  Anthology , with my own money today. (I never buy stuff for myself, just so you know.) I've been meaning to buy it since last month, but I never had the time to buy it until now. The two CD's are supposed to be an early birthday gift for me from me. Wheee. I love it I love it I love it but not as much as I love you guys. Hehe. Wala lang.  Enough with the mushy posts! :D Tomorrow is MONDAY. (Oh that's new. Haha.)  YAY .  Oh, Ateneo beat FEU today. 67-64. Hahaha. Let's hope this winning streak lasts until the end of the season.

        hmm.. i think in this blog i'd be really really mushy.. hehe.. whoever's reading this is bound to know how serious i really am about life.. which isn't really obvious(unless you have a heart-to-heart talk with me...)      what's with the title, you might ask... hmmm... nothing... i'll explain.. but i wouldnt give out too much details.. hehe.. like what i said in my blog(ink patrol), some things are better left unsaid...       now.. here it goes... i'm hurt... wanna know why? you know the feeling when you have a really really close friend (and you consider her/him your bst friend) but you know that she doesn't exactly feel the same way about you? that's exactly what i'm feeling... hehe... and yeah.. it hurts.. if you want details.. as in the whole story... you might wnt to ask me.. but it depends kung magtitiwala ako sayo.. enough to tell you the whole thing.. for now.. the whole story's trapped inside of me... i locked it in.. i dnt have plans of letting out... not now..       why am i happy? because i have friends whom i could tell my "issues" to.. i dnt have to tell them everything.. but they know how i feel.. that's what makes everything ok.. not completely.. but they know how to cheer me up.. thank GOD for giving me great friends...       too much cheesiness in one post.. aargh.. hehe... i'll only be really mushy if i feel like so... haha.. for now.. i'm signing off...

          Hey guys.. Haha.. Well it's 11:11 PM right now, and I just finished my lovely *cough* feature article. I didn't do my best in writing it though.. Turns out it's just supposed to be a first draft. Haha. So I abused that and made my first draft really sucky. Yay. :D  So how is everybody? We weren't able to meet this Monday. So I'm expecting our next meeting to be MORE fun-packed than usual, hehe. Oh, and I'm going to be treating you guys to sundaes on the Monday after my birthday! YAY! Isn't that fun? Haha. Sorry, that's the only thing I can afford at the moment. I'm just a poor girl. :( Pulubi ng Ateneo, hehe joke. :D Pero seriously, money is very hard to come by these days.  Rogee and I went to UST today with our buds, Kiko and Rocky. Rogee, I'm really sorry about the crappy service. You know, if you guys hadn't pulled me back when I was ranting at the window today, I would have asked the guy what the absent employee's name was and march up to the Rector and have that guy fired. I mean, he's been absent for what, TWO DAYS? Poor MedTech and Education students. Tsk tsk.  What else should I type.. Oh. I saw DA LAB OF MY LAYP (eww.) in UST today. Felt sad when I saw him. :( In fact, I was even able to write a short letter to him which will always remain unsent. If you want to read it and laugh at my mushiness, it's here --  urlLink click .  Oh. This is getting to be really long. Sigh. Oh wellers. Good night guys. See you on Monday.  HUGS! :D   edit  I just realized.. I am not king anymore. :( I gave Eumir my title because the kingship was too much of a hassle. So from now on it's Queen Karla. :D :D :D queens are waaaaay more powerful than kings anyway. (Think chess.) Bwahahahaha. But that doesn't mean Queen = King's wife. NONONONONO. NOT EQUAL! NULL SET! Hahaha. =D
