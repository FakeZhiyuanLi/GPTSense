      So first, we'll backtrack to Friday. My mom and I drove half way around Cleveland to pick up a copy of my Birth Certificate, and Social Security Card(no, you may not have the number). Both of these required for a job(why need a copy of my birth certificate, obviously I've been born, and I am still alive...*shrugs* and so ended that day.  Eventually, during the natural sleep process, the sun slowly rises as the moon sets. Now unfortunate for me, things didnt work this way. I went to sleep at 11 on Friday, woke up at 1am on Saturday, and didnt get back to sleep till 6. Early morning television bites. Now eventually I went back to sleep *for an hour and a half* woke up, got ready, and waited for my cousin to come pick me up. When he did, we went to help his girlfriend move back into college. So we drove, out into the middle of almost nowhere(only because there were gas stations that weren't by highways or freeways). So after taking stuff out of her car into the apt, we then had to get her stuff out of storage. When we arrived, we found rat pellets over boxes and containers(nothing like surprises to make a day go better) and we took that back to her apt too, then headed home. Tiring? You bet it was.  (This is where that noise would sound, you know the one from Law and Order when there's a change in scene, or when it first begins. I'd write out the noise, but I don't exactly know how to do that. So from now on, I'll just put L&AN short for Law and Order Noise. So lets give this a try. )  *L&AN* And so sunday rolls around, and what do I choose to do? I play eda video game for about 2 hours straight(very disappointed when i found the special ending...PICTURES...5 of them...they did have two sizes though...small and magnified...boy oh boy how happy I was...anyway back to the point) followed by getting ready for dinner at grandmother's(now this is no sarcasm...very(emphasis on very)very good food(notice the parenthesis within the parenthis)) and so I gorged myself(with children...wouldn't you like to know) and went to filling out paperwork.  That's right, I now what it's like to first become aware that you have been accepted to be an employee. You get to fill out tons of paperwork(I dunno, maybe that's part of paying your dues or something??? I should investigate that...or somethin) but its worth it sense I'll finally have a job.  Otherwise than that, and the fact that I'm writing this blog, I don't think there's too much more to say.  Oh and yes, the title of this blog has nothing to do with the content itself. Just some random stuff making fun of the quote from the matrix where the little boy goes "There is no spoon." That was kind of funny, because when he said that, I could have swore that I was looking at a spoon on the tv, and not only that, but the coding of the matrix would have shown that there was a spoon, so in conclusion, one must agree that even though the spoon didn't exist in true reality outside of Neo's mind, the spoon inside his mind, of the matrix, did indeed, exist(it's smart-#$!es(I'm not sure if I'm allowed to swear or not on these things...(and another parenthesis within a parenthesis(so that makes 3(and 4 if you include this one)))but anyway its smart-#$! such as myself that make really good movies like the Matrix get bad ratings).  This concludes our feature presentation.

      The Once and Future King is not only a really long summer reading book, but it is also an eye opener. At one point Arthure realizes that his idea at at first of "The Knights of the Round Table" was brilliant at the start. His idea of using might to bring justice, and make things right. And so they did. They used might to make things right. Only problem was after they had righted everything that was wrong, his knights had only been trained to go about using might on everything. And so because of this, they were never trained to have a spiritual sense, so might began to be released within the round table itself. Knights within the table avenged the family title for the Orkney's, and it went on. When Arthur realized this, he had to make a change, it only seeming as the sensible thing to do.  Well now, I too realize that I haven't exactly been going about doing things right. When it used to come to helping ppl, I would always become emotionally attatched, seeing as how it would be the only way to keep myself calm*as well as the other person(s)* and try to fix what was wrong. Problem? You get fed up of bein pissed off , or worried, or just depressed half the time. So you go off on a quest to find friends, 75% of them only being temporary. You find these friends and what do you do? You stick with them until you find the few who bring you happiness in life. You manage this, and when you've achieved that happiness, you almost completely abandon your most important morals only becaue you don't wanna return to a life of misery despite the fact that the misery was only to help heal. So you end up almost completely abandonning your most prized morals, and when you realize it, you're complete ashamed of yourself.  Yes, that pretty much explains my story over the past two years. So I guess now I have to something similar to what Arthur decides to do, or more like the idea that Lancealot suggests. Lancealot has the idea of sending the knights on a quest for the holy grail. This way they will achieve a better spiritual sense. So I guess now, I have to go on some type of "quest" to figure out a solution to what it is I am to do.  Other than that, besides that I have less than 200pages left in the book, as well as I am *was when this was written* bored, I don't there's anything left to say.

      This is my first post on this  brand new blog, so hopefully its half decent. So I've finally lost my muse with making music. It's kind of sad cuz now half the time I'm bored cuz I can't make a decent song, but at least the last song I made, most ppl said it was pretty good, which is a plus.  Other than that, at the current moment, there really isnt anything to say about my life besides "Hi my name is *insert name here* and I will soon, I think I already am but anyway, be a sophmore in high school. As part of my high school goals this year, I am sworn to vanquish all classroms of bad grades, smelly kids, and demons*real exciting*. Yea, its that time of the year again, its already close to school startin, but I doesn't really bother me. Except havin to finish summer readin but I'll manage. Besides tryin to survive another year in high school, passing exams, and working on getting a license, car, and job, I think my only other goals are to pretty much nothing.  With that said, I pretty much think I don't have anything else to say for this post.
