       urlLink Rice-A-Roni/Pasta Roni - Products - Rice-A-Roni - Beef   I know this is petty but it's my blog and i'll whine if I want to.  I've been an off again/on again addict of beef flavored Rice a Roni for the better part of 20 years now.  Upon the initial stages of my addiction, the product used to come in a can. Along the lines of a can of crisco. It was my everything, i'd eat that nonstop for months on end, then the problem. I'm a pretty wacked kinda person.  I only started eating steak about 15 years ago, I grew up on hot dogs and hamburgers and pizza. Now at age 36, I haven't progressed much in the food department.  I still eat like a 15 year old boy. I won't eat onions, I can't eat salads, pretty much if its good for me I can't eat it.  I wish I wasn't like that but thats me. Now I was extremely happy when I discovered that I like rice a roni, it was a food that I for years thought of as "not for me kinda food."  In or around the year of 1992, rice a roni started to add carrot chunks to the beef broth and from there my love affair with rice a roni has gone downhill from a strong love to a weak lust.   I have to use a strainer to strain the broth and collect the carrots before I can cook it to eat. I've written to the company to ask if they could stop adding the carrots.  I even went so far as to write a letter lying to them that my sick grandmother could only eat beef rice a roni but she's allergic to carrots in hope they would perhaps send me a stockpile of rice they might have had piled up in a warehouse.  Of course they sent me a note saying due to the demand for the carrots they could not help me. Ahh well.. Sometimes it sucks being me, I almost feel like i'm stuck between a normal reality and a childlike reality that is within my head. Someday maybe i'll act my age and feel my age, but until then i'll continue in my non conventional ways and strain the veggies from my rice. I'll write more as my life happens..

       Read this question, come up with an answer and then scroll down to the bottom for the result.    A woman, while at the funeral of her own mother, met this guy whom she didnot know. She thought this guy was amazing, so much her dream guy shebelieved him to be just that! She fell in love with him right there, but never asked for his number and could not find him. A few days later she killed her sister.    Question : What is her motive in killing her sister? (Give this some thought before you answer)            Answer: She was hoping that the guy would appear at the funeral again.If you answered this correctly, you think like a psychopath. This was atest by a famous American Psychologist used to test if one has the samementality as a killer. Many arrested serial killers took part in the test and answered the question correctly.

      Not much has gone on lately.&nbsp;&nbsp; Past few days have been pretty uneventful other than going to Maggianos again for more spaghetti (I love that damn place) . I've been back at work now for maybe 3 or 4 days now, even though i'm on light duty things seem to be going pretty smooth. I've been pretty mellow lately, even though my time off wasn't and should not be considered "vacation" by any means, i'm noticing at work i'm not at my normal 160% stress level, (i'd say maybe 40% or so right now ;) ) Hell I was stopped tonight at a 7-11 by a homeless guy and I actually stopped and gave him about 80 cent's or so and when I was in line buying a vanilla coke and a snickers bar for me, I bought an extra snickers and gave it to him, I know its not much but i'm sure food in any form is appreciated.  Well it's time to give 1 of my 2 beautiful shelties some medicine which I need to wrap up in cheese. To bad I don't have a cam set up here, I have to sit on the floor and wrap her pill up in cheese, and then my other little girl sits next to me wanting some cheese, and as of last night my cat now sits in the medicianal pow wow and wants cheese. Sometimes I feel more like the puppet than the puppetteer with my little four legged bullies. More to come as life happens..

       urlLink CBS News | Parents Find Wrong Body In Casket | July 15, 2004�14:37:54   How awful is this story..  AP) Authorities misidentified two teens in an auto crash that killed one and left the other in critical condition, stunning parents who realized their son was alive after seeing the wrong body in the casket.   For days, one family kept a bedside vigil for a bandaged-up boy whom they believed was their badly injured 16-year-old relative. Meanwhile, the other family prepared to bury the boy they thought was their dead 17-year-old relative.   But the moment Patrick Bement's parents saw the face of the boy in the casket at the funeral home, they feared a terrible mistake had been made.   "We told them, 'It's not our son. It's not Patrick,'" said Michele Bement, the boy's stepmother.   The Antrim County Sheriff's Office confirmed the error Wednesday and said it was conducting an investigation to determine what happened. Sheriff Terry L. Johnson offered condolences and apologies to the families of both teens.   Deputies said they were in the process of using dental records and fingerprints to positively identify the person killed in Saturday's accident on U.S. 131 north of Alba, about 35 miles from Traverse City.   Relatives said the victim was Nathaniel Smith, 16.   "You can't even put to words the emotions, other than what an immense, gross tragedy — a double tragedy," said Smith's uncle, Steve Bohatch.   The crash happened as Bement, Smith and their 17-year-old male driver were headed home after spending several days at a cottage in northern Michigan. Their Saturn crossed the center-line and struck a camper being hauled by a pickup truck, deputies said.   The Saturn driver was the only person in the car wearing a seat belt and escaped with minor injuries.   Deputies said they found Bement's identification near the body, which was ejected from the car, and believed the body to be his. Smith's wallet and identification were in the trunk, and the officers at the scene believed Smith was in the back seat with major head and facial injuries.   On Monday, Bement's parents gathered at a Grand Rapids funeral home to prepare for visitation services and to view their son's body.   What they saw shocked them: The boy, who had straight hair, did not look at all like their curly haired son. Instead, the boy looked like Smith.   "They had told us to be prepared for a shock because it didn't look like him," Michele Bement said. "They kept saying it was because he had a lot of facial damage, a lot of muscle damage. They thought we were in denial."   Smith's mother, Oksana Bohatch, had even called her from the hospital to express her condolences and to say she could not attend the funeral, Bement said.   "It's a terrible situation," said prosecutor Charles Koop. "I don't know what words you can say to comfort family members when this type of error is made."

       urlLink Toby Keith: SHOCK 'N Y'ALL   Well it was a pretty slow day today, but I had about 10 minz of fun this afternoon. My wife is a Toby Keith fan and we found out his concert is coming to town here in late September and she wanted tickets for it.  And I am pretty good at getting tickets  online at ticketbastard with there service fees and whatever.  Well I got up and went online to Toby's fansite because they were offering Presale tickets for fanclub members.  Well I logged in as her and right at 12 started trying to find seats.  Of course the computer on prickusmaster were acting up, so I had to keep refreshing the screen and try to come up with new curse words to scream at my monitor while I banged the  keyboard like a crazed guy. Anyhoooo  finally it came to life and I entered my info approx 13 minz after the scheduled 12pm sale time, and we got 2nd row center. I think these seats will keep me out of the doghouse for a while. :) I really wish there was a better and cheaper way to get tickets, I love the idea of buying em online, but the service fee's  are incredible.  It does beat the old days of camping out at the shopping mall, well then again, I did have a few good nights camping out and drinking beer while waiting for Springsteen tickets haha..

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Donald Trump Would 'Fire' Bush Over Iraq Invasion : "'Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country?,' said the host of NBC's 'The Apprentice,' whose hallmark line is 'You're fired.'  'C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have,' Trump said in excerpts of the interview released in advance to Reuters.  'The Apprentice' was one of NBC's biggest hits last season, making the real estate mogul a well-known entity to TV viewing audiences.  'What was the purpose of the whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!,' Trump said. "    I never thought much of da Donald before, but this time he is actually making sense. Maybe i'll have to give his show some  time this year.  Even though you made sense Donald, you still need to get a haircut, the Dennis The Menace look went out 40 years ago, if it was in fact ever in.

        urlLink omniauto.com    So I go up to Ted Britt Ford in Fairfax tonight to drop my automobile off for a tune up. I bought this truck there exactly 14 months ago, and everything has been cool up till now. I'm headed up to a wedding in Mass. this weekend and wanted them to inspect the truck and make sure everything is good, and give me a tune up etc..  Everything should be covered under my warranty that I paid $1250 bucks for just over a year ago. Now i'm told by the cashier that  the company they used for my warranty has filed chapter 13 and went out of business, and my auto will have to be paid in cash upon the finish of the work. I'm headed up to the finance office tomorrow  to get this matter settled to my satisfaction. Nice of Ted Britt &amp; Omniauto to let me know that my fuckin cash just went down the drain! Bastards! I'll do a follow up as things change.  I should have known not to buy a ford, i've been a Chevy man all my life and the one time i switch I get screwed. Oh well, live and learn!  more later..

       urlLink WELCOME TO THE OFFICIAL COPS WEBSITE  I'm still hooked on the show Cops.  I wish I wasn't because I avoided it for the past 14 or so years, now I can't get enough of it. Ughhh Here is some things i've learned from watching it  1.)  Everybody and there brother has crack on them somewhere! 2.)  Whenever  you are caught redhanded, your response will      be "ah dunno how dat got deer" or " it ain't mine" 3.)  You'll always lose in a footchase with the Cops 4.)  Chances are if you get out of the car before the officer comes up to your window      you are hiding something.  5.)  If the officer pulls out a liquid kit to test the crack that you have on you, i've      learned that if the liquid turns blue, thats positive for crack cocaine. 6.)  Whatever happend to that HOT blonde female cop from the late 80's episodes.. ;)    Would do more but I have to go watch some more episodes bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna doooooooooo

       urlLink ANCHORMAN - JULY 9th 2004  I just got back from seeing the new movie Anchorman, and all I can say is   Go See It!!!   Will Ferrell is at his comedic best, portraying San Deigos anchorman Ron Burgundy.  His co workers are hilarious. My favorite character from this movie besides Ron, was the weatherman named Brick, portrayed by steve carell.  I won't give away the plot or the surprises, but the cameo's are priceless. So far this summer i'd have to say this is my second favorite movie behind Spiderman 2. My personal feeling is that Will Ferrell is the new leading comic in movies. He has taken the crown from Jim Carey who hasn't had a funny movie in a long long time. Congrats Will!!

       urlLink Yahoo!  Even though the fad has worn off 4 years ago, recently I purchased a laser pointer for $4 at a local gas station, and little did I realize how attracted cats are to this gadget. If you have cats and they are just totally bored, or just sick of the little catnip filled mice toys, invest in a small handheld laser pointer, they will chase the red dot for hours.  urlLink

      After watching television shows for a good part of my 36 years on this big blue marble. I have come to the conclusion that the greatest American television show was written, acted and televised back in the early 1960's.  The show that i'm declaring my undying allegiance to is The Dick Van Dyke Show.  With the superb group of actors that were on that show this show has never let me down. I've recently been given as a gift the 1st Season on dvd, and I just can't get enough of it. One of these day's i'm going to write to the head guru of the show, Mr. Alan Brady himself, the writer of the show, Carl Reiner, and see if he would send me an autographed photo of himself. If you haven't seen and episode of the show in a while, give yourself a treat and turn on tvland in the early afternoon and watch a rerun.  You won't be sorry.

      I have a friend who was given a gmail acct. the other day by invite.  She was able to log on one time to set up her acct. but has not been able to log back on since. She continues to get a "oops..Try again in 30 seconds". I do not have a gmail account, so I don't know what to suggest. Any ideas what it could be?  Also any ideas how I could obtain a gmail account so I can try it out myself?  Oh well, it's been a good day other than that. Watched tv, went out to eat at Pistones with the in-laws, and now just trying out this blog service.  **Follow Up** JULY 11    I Finally figured out what the problem was. I had to just unplug her linksys router and plug it back in. Don't know what happened but all it required was recycling her router, go figure.  Live & Learn...

      Well not that anybody cares, but I had a pretty good 4 day weekend. It started on Wed. which is the last day of my work schedule. The weather here was terrible on Wed. and the power was knocked out for over 6 hours. Luckily for me it came back on around 10:30pm and I was able to play on the PC & watch tv. Thursday came around and after lounging around the house all day I was able to go downtown to the MCI Center and see Prince in concert on night one of his three night stay. His show was incredible as usual. Last time I saw him was back in 1984 during his Purple Rain show at the Capital Center in Largo Md. If Prince comes to your town you would be doing yourself a treat by going to see him! Can't remember what I did or didn't do on Friday, but i'm sure it was fun because I don't have anything negative to post here. Saturday came and it was pouring rain due to good old hurricane charlie. Saturday night was the first home game for the Washington Redskins preseason and now that i'm a season ticket holder I could not wait to go and enjoy the mayhem. I was all set for the pouring rain, I was in fact looking forward to standing there screaming my drunk ass off while cheering on my team, but as luck would have it, about 15 minz before kickoff the rain stopped and the weather was a beautiful 70 degrees and not a cloud in the sky. I'm sure more people there at FedEx Field prayed for the rain to stop rather than my measley prayer to let the heavens open and drench me in all of Charlies wrath, therefore God decided to oblige them and stop the rain. That is the cruel fact that has become my life. :) Have I mentioned this is the strangest life i've ever known. Well my team the Redskins lost, but it's only preseason so I don't really give a rat's ass right now. I have tickets to all the home games and we have our coach and savior Joe Gibb's back at the helm so i'm sure everything will work out just fine in the end. Next weekend we are going to a hot air balloon festival, that should be interesting.  I'll write more as life happens...

      Got some good news today, Raul Malo the lead singer from my favorite band The Mavericks is scheduled to perform in the area here in late October. On the 29th he is appearing at the Rams Horn club in Maryland. I bought two tickets for this show earlier this afternoon.  I get home from work and what do I find, that he will be performing the next night locally at The Birchmere.  And the next night being Halloween i'll be at FedEx Field (I have season tickets for the redskins) watching the Skins play the Green Bay Packers, this will be a weekend to remember. More to come as life happens..

      I saw the weirdest thing today, I was at the gas station while at work today and after filling up my work truck, I pulled out of the pump area and prepared to drive away, but I noticed a beast of a woman about 30 feet away screaming at some other trashy tramp in a mustang. I sat and just watched, since I don't see this type of activity every day (except on Jerry Springer). The beast was screaming in the window of the tramps car, and then the tramp got out and then got into the face of the beast who in turn pushed her against the car and the two of them started to push each other and doing these female windmill type slapping movements upon each other. I was enjoying this until the tramp got back in her car and drove off. I think more gas stations should have entertainment such as females fighting to entertain patrons or at least me. It's the least they could do since the friggin gas prices are out of this world. But if you folks at mobil or shell are listening, please let the fighters be between 19 and 24 in good shape and wearing bikini's.. I guess when I start having gas station fantasies then its time I goto bed.. Cya I'll write more as this crazy life unfolds..

All my life i've been a fan of his father the ultimate daredevel, Evel Knievel. Robbie did a pretty good job tonight, he jumped over fighter jets and rescue helicopters that were placed on the deck of the ship. My only fault of the show was how producers have to draw out the tv special for an hour when they could have wrapped it up nicely in 30 minz.  Ahh well thats why I fix tv's for a living and not be on them. Until more life happens..

       urlLink The Village -- The Official Movie Website   Well another boring day has come and gone.  I've been waiting to see M. Night Shamalamadingdongs movie "The Village." This movie was awful. My wife slept thru the first 45 minz. I had high expectations of what this movie would turn into, but was let down. I won't give any of it away, but let it be known that it out right sucks. Afterwards we went up to Ledo Pizza and got pizza and came home to watch what is seasonally our favorite show Big Brother. Thank God Diane won the HOH contest. It is nice not having a favorite person to win this show, but at the same time it is nice having those two fag's scott & jase to hate. Christ, I can't get into how queer those two are. Bring back Holly!!  She was as smart as my left shoe, but is/was the hottest poa on tv..  ahh well. More to come as life happens
