      today is christmas. this is my first entry. i wonder if i will keep up with this blog or if it will sit, underdeveloped, in the attic of the cyberworld, one more little piece of a forgotten attempt at  communicating with a world  saturated with ideas and thoughts from millions of people trying to reach out and find some connection to ease the loneliness.  well i guess i won't keep up with this site as now i have decided to go and drown myself in the bathroom sink... or maybe i will go to the movies!

      i closed tonite with jessica.  the new SPG (smiling people greeter), celeste, is not making many friends. celeste...that name is sort of pretty but it sounds kind of like a soap opera characters name.   my hands feel dirty.  its worse when i close.  i can't wash them enough. maybe i'll take a shower.  advice:  snuggle down with smiling spoons, you might catch a reflection...don't ignore the rippled condiments give love to the guilty water, it knows no place but you....

      cory and i worked together tonite.  i like being in the same section with him cause it makes work a little more relaxing. tonite was velvety. i could move around and talk and laugh but i felt like i was sleep walking or watching the world under water or with the volume turned down.  i was detached from everything in a good or, at least, a neutral way.  he made more than me. thats not unusual.  everyone always makes more than me.  i don't really mind.  its kind of stupid of me though. i'm not as aggressive  about making money as i should be.  if i layed on the charm more and picked up extra tables i would do alot better.   i usually would rather bus tables and clean and do sidework.

      i like my new job. i wish there were more vegans/vegetarians out there.  it feels better to serve people spirulina shakes and tofu than ribs and loaded cheese fries.  well... ok, we do serve chicken and tuna salad but i don't feel like quite such a hypocrite. i still like Rubys though.  its like high school.  wait. no. high school sucked.  but it was fun... maybe a tormented kind of fun?   i can't remember... what do i mean?  its the way people behave and interact...the drama, the gossip, all these silly but very distinct one-dimensional characters.  that sounds mean but i don't MEAN it that way.  i love them.  even the annoying people.  i'm probably writing that in case people i work with ever come across this.  i always have to throw in a little disclaimer.  but its true. everyone has their place... uh yeah.   i talked to rachel for awhile tonite.  i miss her.  she makes sense to me.   then i watched "The Passion..." movie tonite. i went by myself.  i don't understand why people think its bad to go to a movie alone. i was really curious to check this one out but i wasn't particularly moved or astonished. i could have waited till tommorrow and watched it with cory.  i don't get it.  whats the big deal?  people just need an excuse to get their panties in a bunch so that life feels exciting and there are things to argue about.  perhaps i don't know what i'm i'm talking about and it is terribly blasphemous and insulting to god and offensive to jews  but my generation-or, at least me, is pretty de-sensitized (sp?) and i felt nothing.   maybe thats bad.  i think jesus should have looked more emaciated. sure they had his skin all ripped up and he wasn't fat but the guy was definately not starving.  and i think jesus would have been a bit gaunt at that point. considering how much stress he was under and the torture and all that.  however, i DID think it was cool how his eye totally dialated (sp?) when he died.  i haven't seen that happen in a movie before.  the movie folks are really refining the art of aesthetic cinematic deaths.  things just keep getting more realistic.  soon it'll be more real than real life. i think it already is.   i hope this doesn't sound really fucked up. cause its all beautiful. really.  i do believe that jesus was probably a wonderful, well meaning creature and maybe very holy and he did spread a profound message of love that has permeated the conscience of almost all mankind and has sculpted the framework of various cultures and religions for the last 2 thousand years.... (another disclaimer).  i don't want to burn.  ...and caused alot of disagreement and wars and chaos and deaith ahem... sorry if this is fucked up.   really.

      i overslept this morning.  its such a terrible way to begin the day.   i hadn't even woken up and gotten dressed and already i've fucked up.  i woke up from a deep sleep all confused and sweating from some dream about wolves chasing me or something and i look at the clock, its 10:15 and i was supposed to be at work, a half hour drive away from my house, at 9:00 a.m.  just as this is sinking in i hear the phone. its ring sounding particularly loud and accusatory.  i groan and smush my face into the pillow.  bill knocks on my door to give me the phone.  new job isn't too pleased that i'm arriving late during my first week.  they needed some reassurance that i did in fact want to work there and suggested getting a new alarm clock.  i wanted to cry.  i tried not to let that screw me up all day.  but it just sort of set the tone and i'm not good at snapping out of moods and switching my state of mind once its set in one direction..... i need to work on that. i think its my beds fault.  it sinks in and even though its not comfortable, its hard to get out of.  it smothering even though its a twin.  theres bars on three sides of it.  too many pillows... anyway, tommorrow i'll make up for it.  i'll lay around in bed for awhile and then get up and stretch and drink some coffee and watch cory  read the newspaper and pester him since i left my book at home.  and i'll play around on the computer for awhile or something.  then maybe go the gym or the flea market-probably the flea market.  haven't been in awhile. i miss the corn.  mmm sweet juicy corn with garlic salt and lemon juice.  maybe i'll play with the kids.  eoin is so great. he puts me in good mood.  i wish i had a toy eoin to just pull out and play with sometimes.   oh shit. i still haven't called jessi to let her know i'm not going to mardi gras.  need to do that.  bummer.

      i'm always nice to people.   but i haven't been real perky the last few days. i have an unusually strong sensitivity to the comination of clouds and rain and gray and cold.  if it went on for too long i think i would have to be locked up.   it was sunny for a little while today. i was indoors. at my new job.  i only saw it behind glass and in a car for a few minutes.  but it came in the nick of time.    i had a shitty night at work. busy but not lucrative.  these people, younger people, probably all early twenties, (one girl i know was around that age because i checked her i.d.)  were real pleasant.  made me feel really great.  when they first sat down they were snickering and acting all aloof-like i was annoying for requesting to know what beverages and food they cared to consume. that sort of thing always makes me a little wary but i was too preoccupied to care. the whole time they were there, i was never doing less than 10 things at once.  i was never not holding a tray or plates or glasses and scurrying around trying to please a bunch of people including a table of nine with a little girls birthday. despite this, their order came out  right, they didn't wait long  and i  refilled their drinks at least 3 times.  even if i had been able to chat i wouldn't have really felt inclined to because everytime i went up to the table, the chatter and giggling fell to a dead silence and i heard "shhs" that made me feel  like there must be a  huge booger up my nose that nobody would tell me about.  they were definately NOT friendly but apparently their dining experience was unsatisfactory not because i am incompetent or dowdy but because I was not entertaining enough.  i didn't have time to gossip , shoot the shit with them, juggle, make great jokes,  hear their life stories, offer advice, full body massages,  and give sexual favors while spoonfeeding all three of them at once,  i guess this is the  kind of service they get in most other restaurants.   after i refilled their drinks for the last time, removed two out of  their three plates, and was looking forward to dropping off the check,  one of the girls, after some giggling and hesitation and looking at her friends for some "go-ahead just tell her" signal managed to spit out that she didn't like her buffalo fingers platter at all and didn't think she should  have to pay for it.  although somehow, god bless her, she had managed to choke down more than half of it.  i, of course, dutifully apologized and slobbered all over the place.  since it was a complaint table, my manager, David Funk dropped off the revised check and talked to them to kiss ass some more.  when he left and i asked him what they said and he said he'd tell me later.  i was like "did they say anything about me cause i don't think i did anything wrong. "  and he's like "yeah wait till i get a second, i'll talk to you."  after i dropped the check back off and they put the credit card in the blackbook check holding thingy-- whatever we call it, i went and picked it up to run the credit card.  while doing this none of them would look at me.  by this time i was pissed enough about this table, and everything else that had been going on that night-behind the scenes and with other tables-how i feel when i spend too much time in one day with too many members of the human race,  that  i really didn't give a shit anymore.  i ran the credit card, returned to the table, muttered a "thanks for coming" and a "sorry we suck" type thing i guess we're supposed to say in that kind of circumstance.  i moved one table over to clear off the plates of the people who had just left and i heard the fatter, bitchier girl, the one with her back to me, who's id i'd seen, start to say something and the other two were like "shhh" "she's right behind you."  it was so loud and obvious and i looked right at them when i heard it. it was weird, pleasant, because i was energized and  intoxicated by my anger.  normally i would would have felt sooo uncomfortable. the akwardness would have overshadowed any other feelings.  i HATE confrontation. but i wanted to scream everything you should never say to anybody if you're working in this kind business at them.  i had to grind my teeth and make fists and i just smiled real sweet but real sarcastic and continued piling up the plates at that table right next to them so that THEY felt real uncomfortable and couldn't say anything.  they left me $2.  i was surprised it was that much.  When i questioned David later he was like " "well she didn't like the buffalo tenders platter and they didn't like it that someone else brought them their food and that you were "too quiet and shy and seemed new." " he told me that he explained to them that everyone runs everybodys food here and  thats how we can get it all out and that yes i'm quiet but not new and i do talk if you get to know me or something and i certainly wouldn't want  to come across rude." etc.   it pisses me off because these people were my age and just wanted to have the experience of compaining and getting their asses kissed. its so immature i would never ever do something  like that.  really though, i know i should just be amused.    anyways. afterwards cory came up.  he was off today. we went to see "Monster"  it was awsome. it should have been disturbing and  depressing but it was so raw and bleak and real that for some reason it cheered me right up.  :)

      i'm writing this because cory made me feel bad that i haven't written anything in awhile and jill, who started a blog after me has practically written a novel.  my problem is that i don't have my own computer (as i have complained about before) and i have to write at his house or jills and i always feel that since this is something that can be viewed by other people, that i shouldn't write unless i have something particularly interesting or witty to say, and i'm hesitant to say anything too personal because, as anyone who knows me is aware of the fact that i'm very shy AND i want to use proper grammar and have good sentence structure, and not have run ons like this. maybe i shouldn't keep a blog.......... ummm.. started new job.  is good. me like.  make carrot juice. go now.   work again.  this time Ruby Tuesday.  a piece of popcorn is a frozen explosion  (-Cory Pinter)

      i'm at jills right now.  going to leave in a few minutes.  i spent the afternoon playing with the kiddies.  mostly i pushed aidan on the swing while my mom picked lice and knits out of jills head and put some powerful toxic treatment all over her hair.  jill said she should just shave her head.  it was sort of fun.  except aidan would freak out and start screaming for me to come back and keep pushing him if i walked away even for a second.  he's so cute though.  he says some funny things.  just a little while ago he had an accident.  he stood there looking totally serious with his pants around his ankles.  and said " i had an accident and i'm going to join the army cause we just saw a black widow outside."  then he stuck his finger in his nose and i started laughing and kissed him on the cheek and told him he was cute. that made him mad so i corrected myself and said he was handsome.  he has a napoleon complex.

      i haven't wanted to make any more entries until i had my own computer but since there is apparently some problem with my credit, according to the folks at Best Buy, i am unable to finance one at this time.  bummer.  i can't really afford it right now anyway.  dissapointing...i really wanted my own computer. oh well.  i shall use one of the ones at cory's house for now.  i seem to be here all the time anyway.  hmm.  otherwise...all is well.  i'm pretty content. everything has been soft and cozy lately, warm, fuzzy,  unchallenging.  i feel sort of spoiled. umm  i want to go back to new orleans to see jessi and mardi gras.      fluffy piles of purple puffs  it is very sunny out today.  the light slams down on the leaves outside  making them shiny  pulling out the green.   the weather has a tremendous influence over my state of mind.   maybe sunlight stimulates the production of serotonin (sp?) that thought is sort of creepy.  like i am a machine whatever.  i'm grateful and i should be more often.    but i do want my own laptop  (whiny me had to get the last word.)

      this week went by quickly.  i got to go to the wedding on sat. i bought a pretty sundress and sweater and white sandal/heels, and a necklace with a pink stone- i think its rose-quartz.  there was a lady playing a harp and yummy blueberry beer. very nice.  afterwards we went to see Dawn of the Dead.  blood and zombies. very nice.     yesturday we went shopping again. i bought was two pairs of sandals two sports-bras and two purses-each five dollars. i got a new camera case at best-buy.  this is a lot of shopping for me.  i hate being in most stores for longer than two minutes.  i would almost always rather be riding or driving around in a car.  afterwords we went to the beach.  i was cold but it was pretty.  i could go into a trance staring at the waves.  especially at certain times of the day, when the sunlight shimmers on the water...   i felt like i was looking for something in the waves.   when i was little i used to love the movie The Last Unicorn. a mystical/melancholy animated film.  i watched it all the time.   i haven't seen it in ages and i came across the book a few years ago.  i was excited but it turned out to be one of those rare cases where the movie is actually far superior to the book. in my opinion.    anyways,  a red bull has trapped all the unicorns in the sea.  except for one (the last) in the movie, you can't tell at first when it shows the water, but at some point the forms of all these beautiful unicorns can be seen when the waves are splashing up all white and foamy.  sigh.  i drank a redbull before we went to the beach.

      i wish i got more and better sleep last night, but it is nice to have some quiet time to myself in the morning.  i have another long day ahead of me.  when i get home tonite, i probably won't remember much of anything. i'll just be worn out and dazed and the only thing left will be a blurry image in my head of a huge pile of dirty dishes....reaching up into the sky... at least i'm making some money.  i hope i can get off on sat to go to the wedding of the couple i work with at TNIN.  it seems that getting married is very stressful.

      picture testing.  after chasing this creature around corys backyard for a minute, it quickly tired, and i was able to get some good shots.        i think it is anemic.

      health food store says i can work there full time...i have some considering to do. some pondering, some weighing of options, some pros's & consing,  i think i should take advantage of it.  who knows when i'll find another work environment so conducive to my flakiness.  but i need to stay with Rubys long enough to get my wisdom teeth pulled.  i'm actually kind of looking forward to that.  is that bad?  i've never been put into that trance like state-whatever its called when you're not awake or asleep...seems cool. also, i'll get painkillers and have a day or two to just lay around and drink smoothies and watch movies-hey that rhymes... kind of.  i hope i don't just have a very glamorized notion of getting my teeth pulled and it will actually be an agonizing nightmare. guess i'll see..    i want to learn Reiki (sp?). cory's mom gave me some tapes.  she hasn't watched them but she wants me to let her know if their any good.

      a day off. i woke all puffy and drained from wallowing in despair and trying unsuccessfullly to melt into and become one with Corys water bed last night. i had a very self-indulgent day.  first, i woke up wimpering, heart-achy, brain still humming with a dash of misery-though leftover. however, from somewhere, a crack in a wall, a rip in the fabric of a curtain, a stream of sunlight leaked into my head. and i felt like i had mostly thawed. cory brought me coffee with real creamer. i took a shower. i went somewhere.  came back to Cory's.  crawled back in his bed, fell asleep. woke up. cried. fell back asleep. woke up (from really fucked up weird dreams) thawed out some more but i resented the fact that Cory was in his office all thoughtful and creative while trying to make money and was not doing something useful and productive like building us a spaceship to go to another planet. i'm sure he could do this in his garage. there is enough space and maybe tools and wood and stuff and i think he's like, taken calculus and or something. i think its time.  i saw a U.F.O. a few nights ago.  and there was a huge, clear, amazing ring around the moon tuesday night...  so he went to work.  all alone.   i drove out to Ft. Walton to some cool shops and bought Aubrey some pink and purple scarves. poor little girl. she's beautiful but she is so dirty and won't stop getting head lice so i chopped all her hair off tues night-we stopped for a minute ran outside cause my mom called and said to look at the ring around the moon. and she was excited about it and had me collect the hair in a plastic bag for her to keep but it was dark outside and when she saw her reflection in the window, things went downhill. i had trouble finishing.  she ran in the bathroom and started pouring out the powders and shampoos and stuff and saying she was looked like a boy and didn't wan't anyone to see her. i managed to pretty much finish cutting the loose pieces and got her in the tub but i felt awful. i called bill-(thank god we have good old bill around) and asked him to bring over some make-up.  i put some on her face and took pictures to try and cheer her up. Cory was upstairs with Eric and Aidan and he told them to be nice to her when they saw it. she's ok.  she really looks awsome. i hope she wears her doo-rags (sp?) she's so pretty. not many five year old girls could get away with that kind of look these days but she can.  anyways, i digress, so i'm in these hippy stores and i bought Aidan a Bba uh...blah some word i can't remember let alone pronounce, anyways African drum for his B-day.  it wasn't cheap and i didn't think about it till afterwords but some poor animal probably died to make it. dammit. whatever.  then i went to B. Dalton at the mall and bought a book Cory suggested.  this is good. maybe part of my problem is that in the last few weeks i haven't had a book to distract me and soak up the stuff that festers in my head and becomes negative thoughts.   then i went home, wrote short letters to my grandma and to Sean.  i talked to my mom for a few minutes-she's such a sweet person. looked at the new bamboo floor, then i saw my phone bill.  i'm not going to elaborate on that at all because it just about sent me back to where i was last night. numbers should never hurt people so much. then i went to Ruby's to make sure i was covered for tommorrow since i haven't yet learned how to be two places at once and i'm supposed to work at the health food store. it was all good.  i saw Cory. made the mistake of telling him about my phone bill. glared at him.  gave him eardrops.  came to his house and here i am.

      i wish i wrote more often... lets see, what have i been up to... ran some. swam some. saturday was kind of interesting.  in the late morning i went out with cory and his dad on their boat.  they just got it back after having it fixed.  we were having a good time. i drove it around a little. shortly before we were going to head back to the car, we stopped for a bit and then the boat wouldn't restart.   for the next few hours they fiddled around with greasy hinges, fuses, bolts, whatever-(stuff from that intimidating  mechanical realm that i prefer not to think about). i am so incompetent when it comes to that sort of thing.  i just stayed quiet and out of the way and enjoyed the sun.  eventually they got the boat started up again. we both had to close at Rubys that night.  even though we were stranded  i came to understand why people have boats now i guess. i've never spent much time in the sun and at beaches and stuff but i probably will be more often since i do live in Florida now. there is a lot of fun to be had.     That night,  fifteen minutes before we closed, (wince, roll eyes) these two guys, late teens probably, come in and order dinner. but they were polite and left me a $40.00 tip on $20 something check.  i caught up with them before they walked out the door to make sure that they hadn't made a mistake.  very awsome. that restored my faith in humanity and kept me from being grumpy and thinking only about my sunburn. the next day riding in the van, jill and i and the kids saw something i will probably never again see in my lifetime. something extraordinary.  wonderful. aubrey brought it to our attention.  she said "hey a chicken!" "look" or something like that.  and then i saw,  how or why i'll never know, but on fast, busy, perilous 98, a chicken crossed the fucking road.  a chicken.  a goddam chicken.  and it made it.  monday and today have not been terribly exciting.   i have just a little over a week till i get my teeth out.  i should work as much as possible till then cause i probably will be useless for a few days afterwords.  stomach-ached today. i picked up a shift tonite.  it was alright.  i had a big party of 14.  i don't like having big parties.  they make me nervous. i want to say more, think more, remember and record more details about stuff  but i'm on my third glass of wine and i'm suddenly growing very slow and sleepy and i have to get up for work at The Name.

      jessi came in through town on her way to orlando to visit jonathan.  it was nice to see her.  we wanted to go out and do something and somehow jessi, cory, jennifer, courtney and i ended up going to the new strip club in town last night.  it was wierd, silly, liquor-warm entertainment.  jennifer and courtney got hit on.  jessi seemed a bit wary at first but i think she was happy we went.  cory wore a huge grin on his face the whole night.  i think he had the most fun.   jessi left and this afternoon i went to my apt. in pensacola to see about my wisdom teeth.  i'm getting all four pulled two weeks from thursday.  i think thats the..6th of May?  anyways... i read 4 Harold and Purple crayon books to Aubrey tonite.  those are the coolest.  i wish i had known Harold and his Purple crayon as a child.

      last week i decided that i need to stay at my own house-hah-er...! i mean.... mom and bills house again.  i have been gradually coming to the point where i pretty much live at cory's for the past ??.... weeks (month's?) and something about the luxury of, night after night, coming over and staying in a nice big house that is in no way mine, having half my wardrobe here, and the ability to walk in without knocking is giving me...flashbacks of my first year and all the lonely holiday months in NY. not that i feel anywhere near the kind of desperation, pressure, anxiety and undeserved guilt-(ahem) that was part of daily life then... but seems it left a, complex. That experience, and that may be....ultimately good for me.  anyways i don't want to annoy cory's parents retirement lifestyle and i don't want to take advantage of my moms generosity and i want very much to be more of a help to jill and her kids but  i don't want to live there.  what i need is...to move out on my own again. i feel the itch so bad.   i'm supposed to be here saving money but i have been here since june and i am still where i was six months ago..always a few hundred dollars floating above breaking even of my expenses. hardly making progress towards college tuition and i can't figure out what the hell i would want to major in. how does one come to figure that out?  cause i give up.  its changes every five minutes for me.    if anyone has advice or opinion on that, please share.  every time i get a bit more money i have more expenses to soak up any profit.  ie. my wisdom teeth.  i might as well have the personal comfort and satisfaction of living on my own again.  its hard but i know i can do it, i've done it before and this area is so inexpensive... if i was diligent about adhearing to a budget and kept two jobs i could do it easily. its tempting... i don't know.    so much for my own computer.  maybe i should keep things simple and settle for that instead.  but where would i keep it?   exactly.  i need my own place. anyways... whats going on... tonite we saw Kill bill vol2 ...very good. made good money at rubys last night. its a ridiculous place with a very immature staff-for the most part. The Name is very cozy. very casual, very much a family owned business.  and its helping me narrow down my interests.   i'm just thinking too much.   basically everything is fine and smooth and i'm filling up the blank spaces with introspective crap.   i am thankful for: avocados, red bull, kickboxing classes, good music in my car,  my car itself- my holy blue coccoon of solitude and bliss, south park, rice milk, cory, eric and his dinosaurs, aubrey aidan and eoin,  tom robbins,  florida weather.  even its bad weather is of mild temperament.    i am worried that i haven't heard anything from Dale though.   she kept me sane in 508 of the Empire State.  i miss her. very much.

      i picked up a closing shift tonite.  it was very slow but my tables were pretty nice.   i'm tired. i can't think of anything to say.  hmmm.. i can't believe its already april...spring forward.   i'm eating an avocado.  avocados are yummy. (lately i've been consuming alot of them)  corys ear always hurts :( mom and bill are building another pond i like working at The Name but i spend too much money there. i REALLY hate those bumper stickers that say: "I'm the proud parent of a terrific kid" everytime i see one it pisses me off.   i'm not sure why but it is the most annoying thing to read while i'm driving. it seems quite a  number of terrific kids live in this area.

      there is a fun part of working in a restaurant. generally the staff is young, its fast paced, people aren't stuffy. the work out front, actually waiting tables and serving people, varies a great deal. its a combination of fun, scary, irritating, embarassing, mildly gratifying, akward, frustrating etc.   (my mom always compared it to working in a theatre and every shift being another performance.)  behind the scenes, when its busy, its silly, loud, rowdy, hectic, flirty, absolutely filthy- slimy dishes, splattering drinks, hot plates. servers shouting for a side of butter/sour cream/ranch/honey mustard/blue cheese/extra blah blah/need a follow/rarebits-to-the-line/86 this and that.   i don't want to stay at Rubys very much longer.  i don't think its good for my head. i'm absolutely exhausted and easily irritated when i get home. i especially don't like it lately.  i'm tired of the drama. i'm not involved in any of it but i'm sick of listening to it and being surrounded by it. its brief and petty but its too much like high-school.  that used to make it fun. maybe i'm growing out of it.   almost all of the staff i started out working with is gone.  i've barely been there a year and i've seen so many people come and go. a few members of the old crew are still there but everything has changed so much now i feel like i don't know anyone anymore. there isn't anyone that i particularly despise but right now a huge percentage of the staff consists of young girls just a couple years or right out of high school. they giggle and hiss and hurt each other. i don't want to sound uptight and say i'm all old and wise but there really needs to be more testosterone and some more employees over 22 who won't take everything so seriously. there needs to be some balance.  people can be so rude and mean and ignorant. customers and co-workers.  theres only a handful of people that have any kind of real work ethic.     i've felt like this before.  drained and frustrated from working there but this feels different.   i'm really tired of working my ass off around people who are such complete slackers. i'm very used to people being more chatty and social than me and not being as obsessive compulsive about work but it's getting to the point where its insulting.   it used to feel good to know i'm a hard worker-that people appreciate it.  now i feel like people are just taking advantage of me and using me cause i'm pretty laid back and don't  mind adjusting what tables i take and what type or amount of side-work i do, helping out and being accomodating in general. and i really seem to make less money than most people. so many people do as little real work as possible but just kiss ass a whole lot to their customers and act all phony and so they make all this money. i can't really criticize that or resent it cause of course kissing ass and acting phony is our job...  i feel out of place.  i'm quiet and when i do talk i feel like people don't really understand me.  i'm just neutral. its okay for most conversation at work to be superficial, but when its all superficial, its just depressing. i don't have very much in common with people.  that is usually okay.  its good to work around all different types. but its not different types. its the same types that are different from me.   oh well.  i'll get over it.  i need to stay there awhile. i need money. and i'm comfortable and i would like to think i have some seniority. my managers all like and respect me.  i just know its not something i want to do for a very long time.  its a draining job.  especially for managers.  my mother did it for so long. it amazes me.  she has so lot of patience and endurence.   i am a bit angry at TNIN.  the full time hours that were supposed to come to me following the removal of the wisdom teeth have not happened. i feel that eventually they will need me more so i'm going to stay there with my three days a week and not fuss about it too much.      a few years ago i would never work at a place like Rubys. i have been conveniently ignoring the fact that most of the money i earn comes from  serving meat.    one of our dishwashers, paul, told me to watch "The Meatrix."  i saw it on my break yesturday.  what a great idea.  its perfect.  humorous and clever.

      i want to complain. but there is too much complaining everywhere.  so i will just state how i have been feeling and hope that it comes out less whiny sounding.  i drank too much last night and i haven't been drinking so much lately  so i cried and threw a fit and smoked and threw cory's pee bottle all over the bathroom. i wanted to puke but i couldn't so i fell asleep wimpering and apologizing to the house and cory and myself and my stomach  woke up groaning and blah-ing. i got very angry and emotional today. i threw 2.5 fits at corys house.    then i would calm down and giggle and want to roll around in bed and laugh and cry at the same time.  i soon became apathetic and mellow. we watched 2001 space odyssey and that made me feel...serene? cory says i smell like cardboard.  i feel really bad for my sister.  i want to help her more but i already feel like i'm spread thin right now.    i think i need to find a way to afford to quit working at Ruby's.  hmm... maybe i should donate eggs or develop my psychic abilities and read palms or tarot cards or something...  rob a bank?    no. really all is well except my stomach hurts.

      last night was my first night back at Rubys in two weeks.  thats the longest that i've been away from that place since i started working there almost a year ago.  i was really dreading going back.  i almost envied cory. it wasn't that bad. i sort of slid back into the groove quickly and i worked a double today.  i didn't make much. i can stand it for awhile but i don't think that i'm going to stay there much longer.  time away from that place made me realize just how much it sucks the life-force right out of me.  its really not a good job for me. it doesn't fit my personality.  i just don't like talking to people that much.  oh well.  its nice to know that i can do it though. a few years ago i never would have thought that i could be a server.   its a good thing to fall back on.   i'm about halfway through "The Da Vinci Code."  my friend Dale read it and went to the Met in NY and checked out all the artwork there and went to the Opus Dei headquarters which is close to the empire state building.  it seems that about half the population has read or is reading it. for some reason, i'm sure its a stupid, immature reason, that bugs me. i really like it though. its fun in the way indiana jones is.  i gave cory "Diet for A New America" to read.   i'm hoping that in his fragile state he will be easier to brainwash.

      i have never broken anything except maybe toes and my pinky finger on the blizzard machine at the dairy queen i worked at for two days when i was fifteen.  that sucked. it was like a little explosion of blood and ice-cream.  and it hurt alot. i was pissed off and embarrassed.  i didn't go back after that. but that is like a sneeze or a cough compared to this.  cory broke his leg almost a week ago. his femur snapped completely apart at the top of his leg right below his hip.  i had no idea how awful it can be to brake a bone. i thought people just waddle around with a cast on and get bored and eat ice cream or something.    i haven't been able to do much other than be with him.  he stopped taking pain medication and either went through withdrawal from all the morphine he got in the hospital or had a bad reaction to something. we still don't know exactly what happened. anyway, he couldn't sleep this weekend which ended up being really bad. he went to some scary, trippy, feverish places. but we finally went back to the hospital sunday night and got him knocked out. i won't go into it too much. he experienced something hellish. i was very worried and felt very helpless.  i'm just glad its over.    he is in a great deal of pain.  he goes from hot to cold very quickly.  cold rag on forehead.  then shivering needs more blanket. cramps from not moving the leg enough. bend. hold. massage. no. ouch.  very hard to find a comfortable position to stay in. takes a long time to just make bathroom trips or move to another room of the house and then find out where to sit or lay and how to do it without causing too much pain. but he is sleeping better now. i think that is more important than anything. his parents are being great.  i guess i've sort of moved back in.  i wish i could put up a picture of the x-ray. i got some good pictures of his bruises which are the worst i have ever seen on a person.  its frustrating because i want to just sprinkle some dust on him and make him better. i hate seeing him in pain but i sort of put it aside so i can help.    this week and next are going to be very bad. i think it should get better quickly after that.  of course there will be boredome and restlessness.  but he's got movies and a computer and books and music and the pool.  it will be alot better.   my wisdom teeth feel all better.  i guess this was good timing.

         the website i use for this journal changed or updated a bunch of stuff and i almost left it without making an entry cause it looked all different and made me frown and want to look away. its not complicated. i know that. so now i should change my interface add fun stuff, whatever, i'm naturally reluctant to do that. not that i don't want to but i'm a creature of habit and in alot of ways i'm still intimidated by using a computer. i don't get technology AT ALL and while i know its not necessary to understand how it works to use it, a little part of me wants to squeeze my eyes shut and plug my ears and sing "laa laa laa...etc"  maybe its the concept of technology in general and the thought of its relation to me as a human that i have such an aversion to. i don't like thinking or hearing about it.   its wonderful of course. its magic.  i think it really is magic and people just call it other stuff and the machines and knobs and wires are just props to explain away the magic. its a very elaborate hoax of course.  maybe i should have been born a long time ago.  maybe i don't fit this era so well. no, hell no.  life was way too hard. i like it here just fine.  i think i'm recovering pretty well. i went to work for a few hours today.  i hung out with the kids for a little while. cleaned my bathroom.  i even bleached the floor. i never do that.  i only mention it cause i'm so pleased with myself for doing so.   the weather is so great right now. its where i can wear a light sweater and jeans or a tank top and shorts and be comfortable in either. the froggies are back. they're cute but i'm worried i'm gonna step on one someday. my moods run hot and cold. no....right now its more like warm and cool.  and i'm very broke.  need to get working again. i'm tired. i don't know how to wrap this up but i want to so....

      well. it is finished.  four teeth are gone forever.  cory has some terrible pictures of me all doped up and drooling and grinning.  great. it wasn't so bad.  when the pain comes i take medicine and then i whine and wimper for a little while till it kicks in and then i smile and stare or fall asleep.  i have a pretty high tolerance for pain.  cory's family is in town.  they are crazy.  a fun crazy i guess.  but a bit scary.  but i am blissfully unaware.  i'm feeling hungry again. a bunny eats corys peppers outside.   i hope i am of some use to jill on mothers day.   she has a great journal. on sunday i waited on 20 month old quadruplets.   i finished Still Life with Woodpecker and i'm trying to start skinny legs and all but i keep getting sleepy. i think people are discovering how flaky and spacy i am.   alas, twas bound to happen.  i cannot escape who i am. i wish this did not bother me. anyway time off is good for the soul.  i need to sleep and groan and drool and fuck, um i mean relax. i think my sis needs this sort of thing more than anyone else right now.   what else... today i thought about how much i need to be better about staying in touch my friends.  i don't even know if jessi made it back to new orleans ok. i'm lucky that meana has kept up an effort to stay in touch cause i'm so bad about it i would have given up on me. i actually called my father.  weird. i tried calling dale at leg resource which was nerve wracking but  i was relieved to hear that she's out of town "on vacation" and will be back monday.   ha ha i think i'm feeling all loving and nostalgic because of the pain medicine.  oh well.  the emotions aren't artificial, they just need a little lubricant to actually make me call people and stop me from being such a robot all the time.  i think i get afraid of altering my daily routines cause i'm so lazy and forgetful that if i get caught up in long conversations and dredge up old memories and crap i will get distracted and fail to properly function in my current day to day life.  god. i AM a robot. oh well. yummy mangoes today.   i hate it when people think i can't eat anything.   they should try orange swirl rice dream ice cream.  sooo good.   when i eat it while watching south park i know that i am truly at peace and all is right with the world.

      hopefully Butchie 2 will live longer than his predecessor under the watchful eyes and within the loving embrace of Jesus       she (it should actually be "Butchette") may replace Eoin as my favorite subject.

      cory and i ended up going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 on my friday night-my snow-day.  i am a real sucker for movies that get a lot of hype prior to being released.  i get so curious and have to see it on opening night.  i saw the Passion as soon as i possibly could in an overly crowded theatre. so naturally, i took the first chance i got to see this one.  it was good.  of course its slanted and biased but since i tend to share the directors anti-war, idealistic point of view i'm sure its easier for me to enjoy.    i could see how it could infuriate some people who strongly support Bush and the war.  michael moore is a very talented passionate guy but he seems little too fueled by his emotions. there is some excessive poking fun at president Bush.  i don't really think that is necessary.  i mean, its funny and all but the facts are what is important and there are enough scary ones concerning Bush to do a lot of damage.  too much bashing undermines the films message, lowers its credibility, and makes it seem like liberal propaganda for impressionable minds.   on the other hand, it is a documentary trying to hold up in the theatres along side explosions and romance, harry potter and shrek, and it needs to have some fire to keep people watching and talking and needs to be somewhat dramatic and simple so that it will appeal to a larger audience.  maybe its message is important enough that its worth the compromise.  i don't know.  i wish he would make a film about the meat industry.

      yesterday was my day off and it was so nice.  cory and i went out with the sole purpose of documenting local absurdities. we got a nice start on what i hope will be a fine collection of amusing pictures. then we stopped into Best Buy and got a couple movies, visited the kiddies, swam around in the pool, then watched Critters, went to bed....    now i'm drinking coffee and getting ready to leave for The Name.  now it is 7:00, and i'm back.  this morning i saved a blog draft for the first time.  i didn't like doing it of course cause i thought it would be complicated and confusing and of course it was not and it only took a second. not that i wrote anything lengthy or great but i was in the mood to write and i kept looking at the time in the corner of the screen and i decided that it would not be worth it to be late for work and if i saved the little i started i would still have the feeling that i did something productive before work.   and besides i can't concentrate when i'm worried about time anyway.  i hate that sort of anxiety.  like when you're late and stuck in traffic.  there is absolutely nothing you can do. i might as well just learn to release all the tension that builds up in me. stop grinding my teeth and gripping the wheel till my knuckles turn white, cause time will never backtrack, slow down or cooperate.  i'll keep pestering and protesting it for awhile. maybe someday...  well, my day did not go as planned.  i worked at The Name and all went well.  i left at 3:00 and went to corys to get ready for work at Rubys.  when i got there i was clocked in, and went through line-up. i noted that the place had thousands of servers  milling about and my name was nowhere to be found on the SPG (hostess) sheet or the little zone diagram they keep to seat people. i checked the real schedule in the kitchen just to make sure that i was really supposed to work. well, they overstaffed. as they often do on the weekend, but sometimes, they get carried away and people end up like that guy in Office Space (the one who ends up blowing up the Office). i asked if anyone wanted to go home but no-one did... which is unusual.   i didn't really mind though.  i have mixed feelings.  on the one hand, i was prepared for a night of work and it sucks cause i really need money but part of me is like "WOO-HOO!" its a snow-day. oh, i guess the poor kids in FL never get that. how horrible. really. that absolutely sucks.  during the school year, those gray, cold, maybe academically demanding, lonely, depressing, november thru march, hard to out of bed days, snow-days- or, at least the hope and possibility of them, are all a 7-17 yr old has to keep them going. they are blessings from the universe. from god. If weather is not deemed foul enough to cancel school altogether, sometimes there is a one, two, even three hour delay.  a little chin-up from the cosmos. again, i am glad that i did not grow up here.   the cool part is that although i was trying to see if anyone wanted to go home, i really just wanted to swich with someone and get either one but not both of my shifts tommorrow covered so that i could go to The Name to learn how to close. they close at 4:00 on sat and i need to go just for a 1/2 hour or so to watch them shut it all down a few times so i can do it.  anyways, Teresa, (our GM who is leaving) likes me and wanted to help me out so she was looking for someone to cover my day shift and after awhile with no luck she said not to worry about it and that they would be fine tommorrow and to come in when i was ready. awesome.  she's great.    so, i find myself, with a free friday night for the first time since... i don't know i guess when i got my wisdom teeth pulled which doesn't really count, and i have my day shift tommorrow covered so i'm not going to be all neurotic about when i go to sleep. this is why i feel that tonight is worthy of comparison to a snow-day.  yea for me!   when i came back to corys i pretended that i had quit.  i sounded all sober and resolved.  i got really into it for a few seconds before i went into his house. i was trembling and it felt real.  i could be a great actress if i only had to play myself.

      after work at The Name i went to corys. we watched Total Recall. i forgot what a great movie that is. i love the little siamesebabyyoda creature that lives in some guys stomach and tells arnold to open his mind.  awsome.  too bad he gets shot. i also saw the last 3 fourths of Adaptation. i loved it but i would like to see the whole thing.  sunday was fathers day and i worked at Rubys and i'm going too try and forget it since it was like one of those serving dreams that is really a nightmare and everything is getting out of control only i couldn't wake up and i ended up crouched in a corner rocking back and forth drooling, muttering, giggling...  i like the thunder today. i don't usually.

      long day at rubys.  i went there for the meeting at 8:30 started working right afterwords up until 10:30 p.m.  i did have a break for about an hour which gave me just enough time to eat some peanut butter say hi to bill, reapply my make-up, lose my keys a few times, turn in circles, drive to corys, change my shirt, eat some peanut butter and then leave his crowded festive house and park in the employee of the month slot becausewho gives a shit, corys not there to do it and no one has any idea whats going on anymore.  the meeting this morning was a little encouraging.  the store is getting a new general manager and making a bunch of changes and stuff, going through that transitional time like last year.  whatever.  it's ok again. i guess.  for a little while.  on thursday cory and i saw the movie "saved."  it brought back some amusing memories.   i can't believe i dressed up like a sheep and sang...so wierd i would love to get the soundtracks to those plays they would be priceless.

      sean went back today.  sad.  poor jill and kids.  i gave him some cute pictures.  i have taken about 3 hundred thousand pictures of eoin.  i like taking pictures of all of them but for some reason he seems to be my favorite subject and his little pouty face dominates most batches i get developed at Walmart.  Walmart does a suprisingly decent job of developing digital photos.  it annoys cory cause i'm always like, "look at this one, doesn't he look soooo cute?" i guess it does get sort of obnoxious.    its my day off and i feel like i should go to the beach or do something out in the sun but it is getting too hot. just walking from house to car and car to house i can feel myself starting to melt. i really need to learn how to not lose my sunglasses (and my keys) all the time.    i took some st. johns wort this morning and i'm so happy and hyper. i hate that word hyper. i don't think it was always so annoying. it has aquired such  a girly, bubble-gum, air-headed ring over the years.  i am a wierd and wired happy though. i want to squeeze and bite something, squash peices of ...squishy things.. drive around, really fast, in circles,  and...uh.. i don't know maybe go to a movie with cory?

      all is well.  and cory is doing much better.  i have been having more trouble getting out of bed in the morning lately than i normally do.  (not that i'm usually a morning person). i don't know why but i seem to be coming out of deeper sleep and my head feels like its connected to the pillow by magnetic force.   but there is now a solution to this. the past two mornings, i have found that if i walk outside while i'm all groggy and before i do anything else, and throw myself in corys pool i not only wake up completely and quickly, but, after a few seconds, i become very happy and serene and it seems to set the tone for the day.   the only thing is that then i don't want to get out of the water and morning sunshine and go back inside to get ready for work.  fish have a blissful existence.  except when they get eaten i guess.    however, i like working at TNIN right now.  i mean since i have to work somewhere its a good place for me and certainly preferable to Ruby's, the weekend-destroyer job.  but in a perfect world of course i would rather just swim around and read and eat nectarines and take naps all day long.  or play on the computer and read and watch tv and swim around sunbathe and....wait a second...hmmm sounds like i need to find a way to brake my leg!

      its working! i'm remembering my dreams!  yippee !!  tues night i had a dreadful serving nightmare. i actually woke up sweating.   every table in the whole dining room and bar- whole restaurant was sat at once. there was me and three other servers.  we had no idea where to begin.  i went around desperately telling tables "i'll be right with you" or something. everyone looked pissed off.  a little while later i was stammering holding a big yellow pad that all the orders i had taken were written on.  everything looked scribbled and made no sense and i felt like i was having a panic attack.  an angry hungry blond lady chased me back into the kitchen....   she went into the office to complain but she just started crying the office was in the front of the kitchen instead of the back...   i don't remember much else.  last nights dream was much less distressful though it was unpleasant in a way.  it seems in many dreams i am trying to do something (in this case avoid something)  and i keep getting sidetracked or tripped or distracted from my goal or mission...or something leaves me anxious and unsatisfied.  i was at work at The Name. only, the store looked kind of different and all that like familiar places always do in dreams.  instead of looking out the windows and seeing a shopping center,  there was another building right along side and a cool alley in between.  in this alley were all these stands set up like street fairs in NY. i was having trouble staying in the store cause all these pretty clothes were out there on racks that i absolutely loved.  this is weird cause i'm not some shopping nut or anything but i wanted these clothes so badly it was making me crazy.  they were so cute and unique and i knew i'd never see anything similar ever again.   i went out a few times and stroked and admired them.  at some point i saw angie.  i don't remember much else.  there was alot of sunshine outside...  in my other life...  yesturday cory brought me a rose at work.  so sweet.  he's never done that before.  good move.  today after work i got upset about some apparent money i owe since medical insurance FUCKING SUCKS ASS AND DOESN'T DO SHIT!!  i went to cory's the only thing cheering me was the thought of my spaghetti squash waiting in his fridge.    The insurance issue combined with the discovery that Laurie had eaten all my squash created something inside of me that could have launched me into a very horrid mood   Fortunately, Cory sensed a fit coming and had the good sense  to take me to get sushi.  he's been great lately...  this evening i saw something amazing. it was not the democratic national convention.  Laurie found a lizard outside and brought it in.  at some point, i don't know if it was her or cory but someone yanked its tail off.  awful, but it was the coolest thing ever.     i've heard that the tail still moves after it comes off but too see it!  my god it was awsome!  the creepiest thing. it bounced around for like ten minutes.  it was surreal. comparable to the chicken crossing the road.   mmm i want to go to bed and then California....

      okay. sorry my last message was so pointless. i just don't want too much time to go by between postings. i was just...sort of touching my blog to let it know i was there.  i am pretty useless on saturdays and sundays.  well, my efforts to remember and record my dreams have finally paid off.  i had a very vivid and interesting dream last night:  i was sitting on the toilet and had just finished dropping a nice big one, i stood up and was about to flush, when i saw that whatever was in the bowl was not only much larger, taking up far more space than it should have, but it was moving!  first, i was overcome by a feeling of complete horror then as i looked more closely i realized that it was just a big brown turtle.  whew! (what a relief!)  i was still a bit shaken but i remembered my mother comparing childbirth to  taking a huge painful crap so i started to feel excited and went to remove the turtle from the toilet bowl and love and care for it properly as a mother should.  thats about all.  i know some other stuff happened after, but i can't recall anymore.

      cory and jennifer got me out of work at Rubys tonite... i'm grateful for this but i was sort of enjoying feeling sorry for myself. I pouted all day at the Name, even left a bit early, was planning on coming home and crying after a night of being harassed by the public and their dirty dishes. now i can't do that.   also, i was going to put in my two weeks notice.  i think i'm getting a new job cleaning condos for century 21.  i keep hearing from people who've had similar jobs about how its really not that great, its so icky and hard work and blah blah.    i don't care.  i will be by myself. its good money and i need a break from working in the restaurant business.  if i hate it, i will just lie to myself for awhile until it becomes utterly unbearable.  sounds like a healthy plan to me.  halfway through writing this, cory walked in and i felt something cold and clammy on my shoulder i turned and found my face inches away from an enormous insect.  and right behind that the grinning face of cory.  naturally i hissed and squawked and glared and my heart skipped several beats.  i felt only a little better upon the realization that it was a live lobster and not some sort of mutant rainforest scorpion thing.    cory was playing with it and taking its picture.  somehow that just doesn't seem appropriate considering they're having it for dinner..  fine, eat it, but don't tease and play with it right before you do... thats just weird.    i was mildly amused to see it crap on the table.  sweet karma.

      yesturday cory and i went to Blessing Exchange in Fort Walton. just about the coolest shop ever.  so much great junk.  i bought a dress or slip and a skirt and a little boys shirt for $7.00 and he bought some toys and a really cool little statue.  it was stormy and wet and slippery and i kept trying to take pictures of the lightning bolts.  we pulled over for a few minutes because we couldn't see anything but gray water droplets pounding down on us out of the windshield. that always scares me.  they don't have sewers here in FL. the streets in my neighborhood flood. i worry that my car is going to drown.   this morning i walked out into corys backyard and decided that it was too cold for me to jump in the pool.  it wouldn't have been too cold for most people but if i feel that there is even a possibility that i will experience a mild or brief unpleasant chill, i won't go in the water.  i need to just run out and jump in before i have a chance to think about it.  today it wasn't stormy but there wasn't much sunshine (from what i could tell looking out the window at work) and i started to feel like that little ball on the advertisements for zoloft.  just a bit.  i don't really like being out in the sun alot, i just need to see it coating the world around me and then i feel better.   i need to stop talking about weather. i sound like an old lady.  work was not exciting or bad it was just...  i'm thinking about naming the hamster Sebastian (sp?) they are so cute. i didn't realize they are so nocturnal.  they sleep all day, curled up together, two little puffballs. then they run like hell all night in their wheels.  sweet little deranged creatures.  gotta love em.

      i wish i didn't take bad tips so personally.  it makes me soooo mad sometimes.  notice that for a little extra emphasis i typed several letter o's in the word "so" in the previous sentence.   sometimes i almost want to refrain from saying "thank you, have a good night" as they are walking out to leave or maybe, not say anything, AND not smile.  ooh...that might really show em.    ummm... saw spider man 2 last night. much fun.   and i love Tobey Maguire's blank stare.    i'm going to bed.  i am going to read again about the adventures of a spoon, a can of beans, a conch shell, and a painted stick.  i like this story because i have always sort of had the ability to feel an affection for inanimate objects.    i want to start writing down my dreams when i wake up.  that wonderful mad realm i visit when i yawn and slip underneath my eyelids and my mind adjusts to the dark. i used to do that. for over a year. i actually kept up with it and almost finished a journal filled with stories from adventures in the land of nod.  the book is now floating around somewhere in the infinate city of NY.  very bitter at myself for that.  i left it in a cab when i was drunk one night.    NEXT MORNING  ok now its morning. i didn't remember my dreams. they keep evaporating shortly after i wake up. although i did remember that i was supposed to...remember...  i didn't read my book before i fell asleep either. just passed out.  we cleaned the hamster cage this morning and realized that cory's hamster, Zeus Gordon, is actually the girl and that my little Buttercup appears to have balls.  they need new names now. Cory just informed me that Zeus will now be called Penelope.  i was thinking about Chervil for Buttercup but it sounds too much like "gerbil."  got to get ready for work now.  i can't stand weekends.

      three decent nights in a row at Rubys. i still need to leave the place.   i like The Name so much more especially since i've been working the front now for about a month and i'm finally feeling like i'm somewhat useful and i'm learning about stuff i am actually interested in.  i've never experienced that in any job ever. pretty sad.  i adore my kooky co-workers and it smells nice, well, it used to... until the mothballs. but it'll smell good again soon. there is an energy i like...something hovers around in the corners and whispers in the shadows.  i missed all the fireworks.  shame. they are beautiful like colors swirling out of sunlight behind closed eyelids or shafts of flexing prisms seeping through squinting eyes. imagine how wondrous the sight of fireworks would be to folks living centuries ago.  if i lived back then and happened to be a bitter atheist or something, and then one night i saw fireworks, i think it would make me believe in...something...  wow. profound statement there.  or maybe i'd just crap myself and have a heart attack.   i wish i wrote more often but its hard because i don't have my own computer and i rarely feel like i really have enough time to write.  not that i say all that much but i always think that i'm going to.    so what has been going on...  i know people say this all the time "how time flies" and whatnot but i really cannot get over how fast June  went by. i mean, it almost freaked me out at work the other day. i barely even get to glance at the pretty pictures on my calenders (sp?) i hope life doesn't always speed along this fast because i feel like i could go to bed and wake up in november...   corys mom did something really sweet.  i was so fond of Butchie 2  (i didn't really get a chance to bond with the original) and i was kind of upset that she let corys mice go in the backyard, so  she bought cory and i both hamsters.  cory's is named Zeus Gordon and i haven't decided what to call mine.  i think they are male/female.  i watched the kiddies on thurs. they're getting a little easier to handle now that they're getting older. eric turned 7 last month and eoin turned 2.  they tricked me into letting them watch Spiderman.  jill came home and sent them all to their rooms.  how was i supposed to know they aren't allowed to see it?  they are aloud to watch Twister which is just as...grown-up/scary/violent/bad words whatever.  and pretty much any grownup movie is preferable to that.  it's the stupidest/weakest/cliche plot/corny dialouge nightmare of a film.  that is what isuffered through the last time i babysat.

      jessi and rachel came on saturday, left on sunday.  we had a great time. i drank too much.    sunday cory and i saw "Harold and Kumar go to Whitecastle"  one of the worst movies i've ever seen.  i hate really bad movies. especially bad comedies. there is just no excuse for a movie this horribly stupid. this absolutely awful.  so not funny it was embarrasing,  thumbs down, zero stars, between one through ten, ten being the best and one being the worst, i give it a negative infinity.    when we could finally leave the theatre (i would have left at the beginning but i figured Cory would at least want to see the whole thing) i actually burst into tears.  it wasn't entirely the movies fault but i had gone to see it in the hopes that it would assuage my dreary mood and it shit on me.  i haven't been sleeping well and what i do remember of my dreams i don't feel like recording here.  i haven't been feeling well in general the past few days.  i don't feel like doing anything. hmpff.    the only joy i find is in stroking and petting my sweet Lancelot, watching him run in his wheel and sleep next to Penelope. ahh so soft and small and cute...
