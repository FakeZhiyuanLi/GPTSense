						   So, it looks like I'm going out on a quasi date tomorrow, quasi because it really isn't a date. Well, I'd like to think of it as being one, as I'm so, so lonely. But besides that. See, there's this girl I kinda like, and she digs photography, right? So, I said I'm looking to get into photography, which isn't a total lie, because I do find it quite interesting. Eh-hoo, so tomorrow I'm going quasi shopping with her. Was this wrong, ya think? I probably should have just asked her out, but being slightly overweight and losing ones hair does not make one feel like Brad frickin Pitt. More like Arm frickin pit. Anyway, so I will see what happens. But, on the bright side, it is the start of the long weekend, and I am stoaked for, if nothing else, three days of boozing and DVD watching.   Cheers.

						   Not much to talk about today, kids, except that I turned an embarrassing situation into a rather interesting comment on stupid Canadian sensibility. Okay, so I was in the washroom at work, washing my hands (as I am in in the small percentile of men who actually do). Anyway, I decided, looking in the mirror, to give myself a big ol' smile. Yowza. Anyway, as I did so, a rather large employee of Toyota came in, screaming, "Big Willy needs drainin!" and promptly found himself a urinal. Well, I figured, "Oh, oh, oh my, I can't have someone thinking that I was smiling at myself, they'll think that I'm koo-koo (which I am, but that is a secret between me and you, the internet). So, I pretended to clean my teeth. After 'Big Willy' had finished hissing, the large Toyota monkey..erm...man, came over, didn't wash his hands and said, "Big Willy has had his say" and walked out. And afterwards I wondered, why did I care that someone I didn't know knew that I smiled at myself in the mirror? Who cares? Who indeed? But yet, it's that "image" that all of us has that makes no sense.   And...  All bike mechanics are rip off artists, as I'm still waiting for my bike, and it's been broken for a week, and how long does it take to change a tire and what gives, and I should do it myself but I'd have to take a course or read a manual and of course I don't have time when there's too much drinkin to be thinkin bout.   Zepplin rules.   Josh

						   Along with the unfortunate status of being a writer, I've also had the unfortunate status of being a writer who isn't paid for being one. So, I work various crappy jobs in order to keep myself in beer and nachos. Currently, I am serving what feels like a life sentence at Toyota, working as a janitor. Toyota, you say, well chap, that must pay quite splendily. And then I give you a hard smack and tell you to fetch me a drink. No, good sir (or madam) it does not. It is crappy work for less than crappy pay, and when I am not staring longingly over the catwalk, I am contemplating escape, like a prisoner with a soft concrete wall and a hidden dinner spoon up his shirt sleeve (like they would really make prison walls that fragile, come on, Stephen King, you could have done better, but I liked the movie anyway). Anyway, so yes, today is Thursday, and I am kept sane by the knowledge that a holiday day is coming up on Monday. That is an extra day in which to sit on the couch in my underwear scratching myself&nbsp;and wondering if Captain Picard indeed is a better Captain than Kirk, and wondering when you are going to fetch me that drink. Anyway, that's all for now. I must go and write the next string of pablum that is sure to fetch a coveted spot on my pile of rejected manuscripts (oddly enough, all rejected by me).   True believers, behave yourself.   Josh

						   Since I've made a good portion of my life emulating or copying others, I thought I would continue in this vein and create a blog, in honour of my friend Adam Tod Leverton (look for The wonderful World Of Adam Tod Leverton, a hoot of a blog). Basically, this blog will exist to shine a tiny light on my world, which, on a good day, is full of little floating fat people I call the Griffle mongers. On bad days, they have fur and pelt me with twinkies. Besides my various hallucinations, I will talk at length about my life and my writing, which, any writer will know, is an exhaustive mountain in which to scale. So, enjoy my friends, and please, keep both hands and feet inside the blog at all times.

						   Well, it happened, if only for a moment. I became lucid, and it's only taken a few weeks. Cool. It was a wonderfully disturbing dream as well. I was visiting with my mom although it was the future, she was older and living in a small apartment in a grungy neighborhood in some nondescript downtown. Eh-hoo, I told her how angry I was that she and my father fought all the time when I was a kid, and she said she was sorry, and I woke up crying more than I ever have. It was quite cathartic, and if this is a brief taste of lucidity, then I can't wait to see what happens with future dreams.   So, I'm still talking to the agoraphobic girl. It's interesting to talk to her, especially because she has some real problems, and it makes me feel better. But that's not why I'm talking to her. It's an intriguing look into someone's very private life, and her perception of life is so drastically different than mine.   Eh-hoo, that's it. Tomorrow's friday. Good.  Josh

						   So, the girl I wrote an e-mail too is really cool. Maybe I'll end up with a penpal. She's agoraphobic, which is a bummer, though. But, it's given her time to read alot, and that's cool too. Plus, she has the same dream of having her own book of poetry published, I dream I've held on to since I was 14.   Well, getting closer to that Adam time, hopefully. Hopefully he'll come visit in September. I'm thinking about getting some time off of work so we can go to Stratford. I need to get out of Cambridge for a few days, and this would be a great opportunity. Plus, I miss Stratford, having not been there since I was in grade nine. Besides that, nothing else is new. I have a dentist appointment on Thursday, to check me out, give me the once over. I think I have one cavity, but that isn't my main concern - those two front teeth of mine are are starting to have the appearance of melting icicles - translucent in spots. Why, you ask, disgusted reader? Because I'm  a grinder. I Have a bite plate, but I'm even digging through that.  Anyway, off I go. I'm baking healthy muffins. Oh, I'm at 183. Gained a pound, but still more vigilant than ever on getting back my "Peterborough Body." Rock on.  Josh

						   No, but I'm watching "The Wrath of Khan" and that's what Khan just said. Anyway, so the weekend is over, and I didn't do much. I feel like crap though, and have decided that this kind of living is beneath me and I will surely be six feet under if I don't do something. So, I am. I'm going to go to school, dammit, before I can't anymore. I've decided that the tightness in my chest is unnecessary. It should be. So, things will have to change as soon as possible, or as soon as finacially possible. It's funny, I just found a website like mine, in which some girl was crabbing about her neurotic mind, quoting poetry, wondering about college, that kind of thing. I sent her a cheer up e-mail. Hope she's not some kind of nut.   Anyway, I gats ta go to bed. There are toilets that need cleanin!  Josh

						   Hey yo's,   Well, it's the weekend again, and I'm hoping to make it a good one. I'll (hopefully) be making my lucid dreaming goggles today. They are goggles with little LED (light emitting diodes) attached, which, when you are in REM sleep, will flash, letting you know that you are dreaming. Cool, huh? To buy a pair is probably like, a billion dollars, so I found a place on the web which tells you how to build one fairly cheap.   Well, I want to see Collateral this weekend, as it's going on a month since I've reviewed anything. I feel bad about that, but also, I foot the bill for the movies, so I guess it really is up to me. Believe me, if I could, I would do nothing but review movies ALL week, yes, I would!   I think I'm starting to go through withdrawal from not writing. It's going to be September first that I can start editing "The Custodian." I'm not a huge fan of the editing phase of writing, but in an odd sense, I kind of enjoy it, like taking the chisel to the sculpture and chipping off those last few bits. "The Custodian," if I were a film maker, would definitely be a low budget independent, so I'm not sure what people will think of it. My major motion picture will be "Love's Asylum" which I've been mulling over and planning for about five years now. If I have any chance with publication, I think it will be with that one. But hey, if "The Custodian" gets published, I definitely won't complain!  Well, I've pretty much accepted that I'll be a janitor until my lease here is up. I mean, in a town like this, it's hard to find any good jobs. And since it is primarily a factory town, I'd have a hard time finding any job that wasn't in a factory, doing some kind of labour intensive work. So, I might as well get paid decently for doing next to nothing. On the plus side, I get ALOT of books read.   Anyway, that's about it. Hope all is well with you, internet, and that you are keeping your nose clean. Talk to you soon!  Josh

						   Yo. Well, nothing new, really. I try, but it all stays the same. I'm like a gerbil on a treadmill, huffing and puffing and drinking but not really getting anywhere. Oh well. I believe (for now) that everything happens for a reason, and that my asylum in Cambridge penitentiary is only temporary. I haven't started on the screenplay, as I am too busy working, but I hope to start it soon. I won't be working on "The Custodian" until September. The editing should go well, and then I can fire it off to a number of smaller publications. Supposedly, being a writer in Canada is infinitely better than the U.S. where everything is big business and slippery agents. Hoping hoping, fingers toes and other appendages crossed.

						   No, but I feel like it. I've been at Toyota for eight months now, and it feels like years. But, I'll survive, if only to walk away with a couple bucks in my pocket, and the satisfaction of knowing that I blew precious moments of my life scrubbing toliets.   Not much to report, kids. Being on break between 1rst and 2nd draft leaves me hanging a bit. So, that leaves me time to work in my new hobby: lucid dreaming. I've been interested in it for awhile, so now I have time to practice. I can't wait.   Anyway, I'm going to bed.   Josh

						   Yeah, so I gained three pounds over the weekend. OH! The humanity! I thought I was doing so well, too. Usually my weekends are a blur of sugar and alcohol, but this weekend I kept rather lucid. . I spent a few hours TRYING to read at my pub, but, of course, slack jawed gawkers and beer guzzlers quashed that idea rather quickly. I had some MO beside me who insisted at reading all the TV trivia questions out loud so that everyone could hear his stupid annoying voice. "Haw haw, what drink did John Wiliams drink while writing ET?  HA, I bet...yep, it was Tang!" So I moved, much to the chagrin of my waitress (university student, blonde, doesn't read, nice body). Yeah, so, besides that, the weekend was as weekends go. Non-going.   I'll do something one day. I predict that my 30's will be a fire cracker of activity! Or, you know, a short drop and a sudden stop. One of the two. I finished reading 3001 last night, by Arthur C. Clarke. Cool guy. He invented satellite technology. Man, how many of our modern conveniences have been thought up by nerdy sci-fi authors? Most, I think. I think George Orwell thought of the toaster, you know, in his novel: "nineteen Eighty Toasters" which wasn't as successful as his other one of a similar name.  I also watched "Solaris" with George Clooney, a movie by Canadian Steven Soderbergh (sp?). I liked it, in the kind of way you like kittens with clipped ears. It was watchable, but only by yourself. I watched with two other people, and therefore felt bad that the movie was bad. Go figure.   Anyway, that's about it. I have to get ready to go to work, where I will do the same thing I've done for the past eight months. Actually, it's eight months today that I started. Who knew a janitor job could be so depressing and soul sucking. Oh well, only nine more months until parole.   Keep true my friends.   Oh yeah. I think I'm losing my religion, but not in a hip REM kind of way. I'll talk more about that later.   Josh

						   Sarah Mclachlan used to get the poetry machine churning, and she did it again. I haven't written a poem in almost half a year (and that for me is pretty bad. I used to write four a day, no kidding).   Autumn Bites   Autumn bites summer,  rhhrrr snag, rip,  till it bleeds colors dripping off the leaves.   I want fall because it’s cool, because the blood burns my legs biking the hill to work (climbing work)  I want fall to rain on me because it feels like I do,  malting,  shedding,  if and buts and candy and nuts sprinkling, tumbling down the roads squashed under my rear tire the cool soil the chill morning,  the feeling that summer was just a dream.   So the girl I had has a man who’s sixty, so the girl I had has a man and child, so the girl I want has five fingers stuffed with rings,  uses my poems to balance the kitchen table, splattered with dry                           strained                          peaches

						   I was working with this cool Jamaican guy the other night at Toyota, and, well, yeah, he pointed out to me (not in a bad way, but in an off hand way) that my life is really pathetic. He's twenty, out there, living life, and I get goofy over new plot lines, or a quip for one of my characters. Yeah. I have to do more with my life besides write, but, I don't know, maybe my obsessive nature with writing will pay off in call girls and limousines...although I'd be happy with hookers and taxi cabs. Anyway, it's the weekend again, and I'm doing nothing, as usual. I bought a used PS2, as I spend my nights playing video games anyway, so I might as well play GOOD games. Right now I'm watching a Bjork concert, the smell of oatmeal raisin cookies cooling in the kitchen, non-sugar non-fat non-wheat and they taste raw. But, I try. Anyway, I'm losing weight, and that's important. When I checked on Friday, I was down to 182, which is still waaay to heavy (I'm 5'8) but it's down from 188, and that's only in a week. Keep hope alive.   I'm going to see Collateral tomorrow, because I've been neglecting my duties to CINN.CA. I'm their movie critic, and quite proud of it, although I'd like to get paid, but the ones who run it also don't get paid. It's all a labour of love, and I'm glad to be apart of it.   Anyway, it's been cool here in Canada. I'm afraid that summer was a wisp and a rumour this year. I'm looking forward to fall, only because of Adam visiting (maybe hopefully) and in the fall I'll start "Love's Asylum" which is my version of a big budget film. It's not a film, though, but a novel; I just think of it that way.  Anyway, kids, I gats ta split. Keep cool, keep kind.   Josh

						   I'm DONE I'm DONE Yeah yeah yeah! Well kids, I finished my fourth novel today. Wow. Four. Cool. I'm giving myself four weeks off, and then it's edit time! Hopefully I won't butcher this one the way I did the other one. Eh-hoo, so it's Friday, and I hope I don't spend this weekend as soused as I did the last one. I don't think I will. Anyway, I hoping to transfer a stage play over to a screenplay over the break, so the writing, of course, never totally stops. It'll be cool.   So anyway, there is this nut case which has decided to sue CINN.CA because of some inflammatory remarks. Why is he a nut case? This guy has sued so much that the courts won't allow him to sue anymore. Dorkus, malorkus. Anyway, so there was a story about him on the website, and I guess he got all hot headed over it. What a MO.   anyway, that's all for now.   Josh

						   So, I found out the other day that the guy my ex married is 60, and she's 24. Wow. Hope when I'm sixty, I'll get a 24 year old girl. Well, good for them. She always needed a replacement father, and I guess she found one...or grandfather, whatever.   So, the roommate is home tomorrow, and the place is no longer mine. That's cool too. At least when I croak, someone will be around to discover the body.   Besides that, nothing's really that new. I had to defend my friend Adam the other day. his EX (all ex's are beauties, ain't they?) made scathing attacks on him, on his poetry blog. It's bad enough to insult my friend and yoda mentor, but it is quite another to insult him on his poetry blog. Adam's poetry is, like, some kind of edible metal, if that makes any sense, because it doesn't to me.  Well, not done the new book yet, but I'm looking forward to the month break, in which time I will be converting a stage play of mine to a screenplay. My brother knows a filmmaker, so I figure, what the hell. The play is called "Cracktown" and it is about my time as a janitor in a mall in downtown Vancouver. Any of you who've ever gone through Main and Hastings, you'll dig what I'm saying.   Hope you, the internet, are feeling well. Don't let the porn crowd you out! You the internet, you good folk.

						   Hey kids,  Well, it's the end of the three day weekend. In fact, it's technically Monday. Another month has started, August, and another month closer to the big 27, and me still playing video games and writing and dreaming. When will I grow up.   Well, I've made the decision to get in shape. I've done it before, successfully, but certain life choices have always flung me back into the throes of Mr. Tim Hortons and Mr. Guiness. It's funny how little determination it takes to change yourself. It's just a little uncomfortable feeling as you change your internal programming. I think I can do it. I'm tired of being fat and tired.   Well, haven't finished the book yet, but I should be done before the end of the week. I have low hopes for this one as I am an unpublished author trying to publish a novella. It's like trying to buy a sports car with a ten dollar bill - but, who knows, maybe a matchbox racer.   I hate the thought of going back to work tomorrow. Work, at the end of a three day weekend, seems so abhorred. But, oh well, if it gets me back out west, then it's worth it.   Good night.  Josh

						   Or maybe retarded, I'm not sure. Well, it's 12:51 AM, and thus far I have spent the first two days of the long weekend drunk. I'm not happy about that. Not because I don't enjoy the drink, but it's because it's forced me to relive memories, like alcohol fueled holograms. So I'm sobering up now (because I'm out of booze) and I'm watching Vanilla Sky (because I have a slight crush on Penelope Cruz). I've been thinking a lot about my mistakes, most of them made with a girl I went out with. It's strange, how the people we are now can be so different, although our names stay the same. How a few accidental moves could change everything. How a book called Awareness could rip me away from who I was. And although I'm a drunk, I'm young enough that it's not yet a problem. Anyway, where was I...oh yeah. It's strange how, if I could go back and change who I was in Vancouver, I don't think I would. Sure, I miss her, but it's like missing a warm hug or a sweet smile. They make you feel good, but do they really do you any good? Hmm. Questions for the undertaker when I see him.   Besides that, nothing else is new. I'm going to try and enjoy my Monday off, pushing off work as far as possible. I hope to work on some writing. With some commitment, I should be done by the time my roommate gets back from Vacation. This solitude has been good, in a debauchery kind of way.   Good night kids.

						   Well kids, I'm almost finished my fourth book. Not that it means very much, I'm just trying to build a little fort out of my manuscripts. No, I hope that this one is at least readable. My last novel, "The White Flower" was a great book until I became the Edit Nazi and slashed and ripped and shredded until I had a novel so bare that even Elmore Leonard would blush.   Yeah, so my date was cancelled. The girl said she didn't feel well, and that was cool. I ended up drinking juice and sake while watching "8 Mile," a suprisingly good film.   That's all for now. Hope I can get some more writing done today. Yay.   Josh
