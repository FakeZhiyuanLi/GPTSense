      blogging's like writing in a personal diary? can vent my anger w/o revealing my identity..ahaks hmm very mysterious..:D  yesterday, so much things happen... at work, i was upset wif tangkeci...no backbone..!! we'r facing some probs, but, when it comes to bringing it up to the relevant parties, i complain alone.. everytime, while lunching, she will scold dk n sn...i was so angry..  i mean, ko asyik complain dopopatjam, abih, bila suruh confrant, tak nak.. u big time coward..!!  sebbaik pompuan, kalau jantan, i da panggil u, takde bodek punyer org... chit...tak bule harap langsung.. it makes ME d bad person..while U, alwiz d goody two shoes girl... who makes everybody smile with your clumsiness n stooopid jokes..  anyway, i dun give a damn anymore.. from now on, U STAND UP ON UR OWN... i'm not going to support or help or assist u in any way... so many times, u have failed to take d initiative to help me, when i was overloaded wif work.. i'm dissapointed in you, tangkeci....  at mami's home, finally, i understand her worries... "kenapa mak dia tak jempot mami?  mami gi umrah, tak datang tngk...tapi, zul gi umrah, sanggup datang jauh2..mlm2 plak tu... pindah rumah, tak jempot, babyaqil cukur rambot pon tak jemput...kenapa?" "dia pon, mami tngk, sejak semenjak ni, da lain mcm ngan mami..." how now brown cow?
