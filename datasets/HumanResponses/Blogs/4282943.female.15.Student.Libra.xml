        It's funny... I'm talking to an old friend and she tells me how much I've changed. I've been hearing that a lot recently. So, I changed, we all do. Thankfully, this friend didn't seem to think this change was horrible... Most people do.

        Who am I? Better question, what am I?   What are YOU?   Look at yourself; we could be the same, we could be total oppsites.   Are you afraid ?   You should be.   Why?   I dont know, do YOU?   So odd, dont you think?   This passage means nothing, it is nothing;   And YET it is all that I see to be able to think about.   Who am I? What am I? What are you?

        How could words possibly describe this moment to you? It's almost perfect. A moment of absolute reflection, one where you finally realize something that has evaded you for so long. For me it was change.  I know it sounds crazy but I've just realized how much I've changed.

         So, I'm reading other people's posts (you know just for fun...To see how the rest of the world functions) and as I read on...I begin to feel small. I usually like to think of myself as a creator... Because that is what I do... I create. I'm an artist, I'm a writer. But as I continue to read I feel like neither, I feel useless, worthless. I mean some of these others are amazing... Their works inspire, they have passion. And so I wonder if I will ever be in those ranks ... Be one that inspires, empowers. Will I ever have that kind of passion, and if I do, will it ever shine through as brightly as these did? I'm astounded, I cant speak... I feel small.

                               There are times when I feel I don’t belong; There are times that I feel foreign and alone. It's funny actually, quite an odd sensation, Feeling like an outsider in all situations. I am so confused about who i am, Someone help me, Please take my hand. Its clichéd, I know, But the pain I feel is real; To express the true me, That is my one and only dream. What will it take then, to be truly free. .
