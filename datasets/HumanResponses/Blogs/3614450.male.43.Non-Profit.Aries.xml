						   Self Esteem and the Coming Out Process:  By W. D. Hunter, a facilitator of a “Coming Out” Peer Support Group for over 13 years.    “The mission of Out-Reach in Central IowA  ( ORICIA@qwest.net ) is to improve the quality of life for gay and lesbian members of Central Iowa by providing support through social and educational functions thus presenting a positive homosexual image to all of the community.”   My apologies to those fine reference materials sited bellow for the blatant theft of their ideas.  I had to establish a base line to start these communications.  I hope you will accept my word that these sources are not from myself; these are independent and verifiable third parties.  I did steal and co-opt their ideas and hope to merge them into my essay on the Coming Out Process and self-esteem.  I do hope you will accept this data and possibly read from the entire document that I have cited as my source.  You are welcome to make tweak and make whatever adjustment to these terms, as your life experience will permit.  I do not have all the answers as to when and where coming out deals with all the complexities of your life.  I cannot not preach to you about honesty or integrity. As I have not spent even a spit second in your shoes. You maybe young and still not sure if you are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or if you are fortunate enough to be amongst the undisputed majority (HETEROSEXUAL).  Will Mom and Dad, other family and friends still love and honor my presence?  If I had all the answers I would write a book and make a bundle of cash like the authors of other books:  “The Best Little Boy in the World” published in 1973 by Andrew Tobias; “Coming Out Right: A handbook for the gay male” published in 1982 written by Wes Muchmore and William Hanson;   “The Unofficial Gay Manual: Living the Lifestyle (or at least appearing to)” published in 1994 written by Kevin Dilallo and Jack Krumholtz;    And my favorite book on this subject is “Coming Out: An act of Love” published in 1990 written by Rob Eichberg, Ph.D.    I mailed a copy of “Now That You Know: What Every Parent Should Know about Homosexuality” published in May 1979, Written by Betty Fairchild and Nancy Hayward.  (The very same month and year I graduated from High School): I only started the self acceptance phase at around 25 years old and finally started to gain value in letting the people I thought was important to me just shortly before my 28th birthday; No gifts are necessary!    It was not until I became a facilitator… October 1992 that I learned that I can read all books about the “Coming Out Process” and how my parents, siblings and significant others would view my dealing with the process.  I assume most of you know what sexual orientation you are.  I do not have the time, natural resources nor tracking capabilities to monitor a young person and their hormonal changes.  It is like watching the tides come in and go out!  One meeting I saw people that were self-described as straight!  A few months later we would hear of someone that finally saw merit in recognizing that we do indeed have bisexual’s in this world and just maybe they were counted amongst that number.  A few more meetings and some time and reflection upon their part and they might accept the possibility that they could be “gay or lesbian”.  I never attempted to slap a label upon them and say; “okay, you are gay and you will act gay!” as that would be wrong.  I knew that you would have to come to the conclusion that you were whatever sexual orientation you decided you wanted to become.    As a group facilitator; I could not and would not pressure you into describing yourself as Caucasian, African American, Hispanic or even a human being.  At the earliest stages; I thought I was very much alone in coming out process.  I did not even recognize that it was a process.  I was in the woods of my life and lost!  I was amaze to learn that by going to the local bookstore (Borders) and now; Barnes and Nobles, that they had an entire section of their sales attributed to gay and lesbian studies!  I was not going to be caught dead with one of “those” books!  Written by one of “those” authors.   The dishonor I would feel because I even considered myself that “sexual orientation” and the dishonor it would bring to my family and small town Iowa community was more than I cared to consider.  I understand the concept of being on the “down low” (book plug: Title: On the Down Low: A Journey Into the Lives of Straight Black Men Who Sleep With Men  ISBN: 0767913981 Author: J. L. King Foreword by E. Lynn Harris Format: Hardcover / April 2004)  as I was very much like the author of this book.  I would accept myself as being non-human or different in my orientation emotions.  I should have written a book!  Some day maybe I will.  I hope you find some merit to these words.  You do not have to wear a label to be human.  You just have to be a human being first and foremost.  I could get the Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary’s definition of that; however, they would ask for royalties.  I am pushing the envelope as we speak.  Use whatever dictionary you find handy and have some meaning in your life.  I grew up with Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary so that is what I am most comfortable.  Eleven Editions do you think I can sit down and write just one?  My personal and professional thanks to the authors of these and many other fine books you might like to read at your leisure and comprehend as to what the “Coming Out Process” may or may not entail to you or anyone else that might come into contact with your life.
