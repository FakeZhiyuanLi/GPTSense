      I got this from my dad with the following short note:  "Thought you may get pleasure from this."  And I did, so I'm posting it here for you too: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Americans   You probably missed it in the rush of news last week, but there was actually a report that someone in Pakistan had published in a newspaper an offer of a reward to anyone who killed an American, any American. So an Australian dentist wrote the following to let everyone know what an American is, so they would know when they found one:  An American is English, or French, or Italian, Irish, German, Spanish, Polish, Russian, or Greek. An  American may also be Canadian, Mexican, African, Indian, Chinese, Japanese,  Korean, Australian,  Iranian, Asian, or Arab, or Pakistani, or Afghan. An American may also be a Cherokee, Osage, Blackfoot,  Navaho, Apache, Seminole, or one of the many other tribes known as Native  Americans.  An American is Christian, or he could be Jewish, or Buddhist, or Muslim. In fact, there are more Muslims  in America than in Afghanistan. The only difference is that in America they are free to worship as each of  them chooses.  An American is also free to believe in no religion. For that he will answer only to God, not to the government, or to armed thugs claiming to speak for the government and for God.  An American is from the most prosperous land in the history of the world. The root of that prosperity can be  found in the Declaration of Independence, which recognizes the God given right of each person to the pursuit of happiness.  An American is generous. Americans have helped out just about every other nation in the world in their time of need. When Afghanistan was overrun by the Soviet army 20 years ago, Americans came with arms and supplies to enable the people to win back their country. As of the morning of September 11, Americans had given more than any other nation to the poor in Afghanistan.  Americans welcome the best, the best products, the best books, the best music, the best food, the best athletes. But they also welcome the least.  The national symbol of America, The Statue of Liberty, welcomes your tired and your poor, the wretched  refuse of your teeming shores, the homeless, tempest tossed. These in fact are the people who built America.  Some of them were working in the Twin Towers the morning of September 11,  2001 earning a better life for their families. I've been told that the World Trade Center victims were from at least 30 other countries, cultures, and first languages, including those that aided and abetted the terrorists.  So you can try to kill an American if you must. Hitler did. So did General Tojo, and Stalin, and Mao Tse-Tung, and every bloodthirsty tyrant in the history of the modern world. But, in doing so, you would just be killing yourself.  Because Americans are not a particular people from a particular place. They are the embodiment of the human spirit of freedom. Everyone who holds to that spirit, everywhere, is an American.  Pass this around the World...on the American Internet, I might add.  God Bless America!!

       urlLink This article  scared the begeebus out of me.  My dad is retired army and was just telling me about the possiblity of being called up out of retirement.  I immediately shot off a message to him to 'make sure' that he's not one of them.  Pretty sure he's not, but I know the possibility is there.  And that's scary.   UPDATE: Got a message from my Dad  assuring  me that he's not getting called up.  Whew.

      It was to be my first car.  My dad bought a 1974 VW Thing in 1995.  He told me he was going to fix it up for me and give it to me once I got my drivers license.  The problem was that he fell in love with it while fixing it up.  And couldn't let her go.  So he kept it.  And even had the Thing detailed "Pete's Thing".  When he moved a few years later, he sold it to make the move smoother (fewer vehicles).  Unfortunately, he didn't tell me first so I had no opportunity to buy it from him.  And, in all reality, I likley wasn't in a financial situation to be able to purchase it anyway, being a poor college student on a vehicle-unfriendly campus.  I had lost the battle...  ...but not the war!  While in LaCrosse a couple of weekends ago, I happened upon a 1974 VW Thing.  Now, the kicker about it was that it appeared to be the EXACT car that I was supposed to get in 1996 except that it wasn't detailed "Pete's Thing" (perfect!)....yellow body, black soft-top convertible.  Looks like  urlLink this .  The sign didn't give much detail other than a number to call.  Discovered that the guy only wants $3,000 for it.  It's been in storage for a while so it needs a tune-up but is allegedly in great condition.  He has to sell it because he's getting married, with a baby on the way, and it's just not practical any more.  I tried talking Craig into letting me buy it, but we just bought the house and money's tight.  He won't budge.    So what's a girl to do? Call Daddy.  Dad FLIPPED!  Proclaims that we are "Back in the Thing Business."  I'm going to test drive it while I'm in LaCrosse this weekend.  And, if the guy hasn't already sold it (he has some other folks looking at it too), it may be mine, oops, ours!    I can't explain my obsession with this vehicle other than I think it's  damn  cool.  It  is  my dream car.  If we get it, the only issue is going to be who gets to 'keep' it.  The way I figure it, it's  my  turn!

      You have GOT to be kidding me.  What worthless liberal drivel!   Jordanian defense lawyer Mohammad Rashdan showed CNN the documents, which were filled out after the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited the captured leader on January 21.  Rashdan showed one page of the ICRC report, on which various boxes can be checked to indicate the physical condition of a detainee.  "Good health" and "slightly wounded" are marked to indicate Saddam's condition.  "Why would he be slightly wounded a month after his arrest?" Rashdan asked during an interview with CNN. "He's being abused, just like the prisoners of Abu Ghraib were abused."  However, the attorney had no proof of any abuse.  Rashdan has never spoken to or seen Saddam, despite making several requests to do so, he said.   Come ON!   SLIGHTLY WOUNDED   is now abuse?!  Give me a break.  Oh, but it gets better...   Rashdan also complained that he doesn't think the United States will be able to provide him and his client with a safe meeting place when they are finally able to get together.  "They cannot even protect their own troops from insurgents. It's a disgrace," the attorney said.  "How can they provide me with a chance to sit down and talk to him without dangers of all kinds looming around us?"   Gee.  Iraq = Terrorists running around trying to kill US Troops.  US = Relatively safe place in the world.  What a frigging idiot and media whore.  The FACT that CNN.com had this  headlined  as  urlLink "Lawyer: Red Cross Found Saddam Being Abused"  makes me ill.

      Now here is the way to treat inmates...  Sheriff Joe Arpaio (in Arizona) is doing it RIGHT!!  He has jail meals down to 40 cents a serving and charges the inmates for them.  He stopped smoking and porno magazines in the jails.  Took away their weights.  Cut off all but "G" movies.  He started chain gangs so the inmates could do free work on county and city projects. Then he started chain gangs for women so he wouldn't get sued for discrimination.  He took away cable TV until he found out there was a federal court order that required cable TV for jails. So he hooked up the cable TV again but only let in the Disney channel and the weather channel. When asked why the weather channel he replied, so they will know how hot it's gonna be while they are working on my chain gangs.  He cut off coffee since it has zero nutritional value.  When the inmates complained, he told them, "This isn't the Ritz/Carlton. If you don't like it, don't come back."  He bought Newt Gingrich' lecture series on videotape that he pipes into the jails. When asked by a reporter if he had any lecture series by a Democrat, he replied that a democratic lecture series might explain why a lot of the inmates were in his jails in the first place.  You have to love this guy!!  More on the AZ Sheriff.  With temperatures being even hotter than usual in Phoenix (116 degrees just set a new record), the Associated Press reports about 2,000 inmates living in a barbed-wire-surrounded tent encampment at the Maricopa County Jail have been given permission to strip down to their government-issued pink boxer shorts.  On Wednesday, hundreds of men wearing boxers were either curled up on their bunk beds or chatted in the tents, which reached 138 degrees inside the week before.  Many were also swathed in wet, pink towels as sweat collected on their chests and dripped down to their pink socks.  "It feels like we are in a furnace," said James Zanzot, an inmate who has lived in the tents for 1-1/2 years. "It's inhumane."  Joe Arpaio, the tough-guy sheriff who created the tent city and long ago started making his prisoners wear pink, and eat bologna sandwiches, is not one bit sympathetic.  He said Wednesday that he told all of the inmates  "It's 120 degrees in Iraq and our soldiers are living in tents too, and they have to wear full battle gear, but they didn't commit any crimes.  . . so shut your damned mouths."

      Ok, I had my  urlLink rant  over at cat.aiesec.ws yesterday.  Today, there are new postings by  urlLink Mike ,  urlLink Digs  and  urlLink Dody  thrown into the mix on the issue.  I  urlLink agree  that the stories of folks actively involved in AIESEC 'mission-related' activities (traineeships and MC posts) should be of first priority when things are pinched (like server space, money, other resources, etc).     However , I  don't  see why the administrators at aiesec.ws can't  link  to other sites external to its server.  This way,  urlLink Dody ,  urlLink Kristie , the Aussie crew, myself and others who were once involved with AIESEC can continue to weblog on free sites such as this without taking up server space (ideally creating a more stable aiesec.ws server) yet allowing new alumni and members from around the world to be able to stay connected to the AIESEC community.    For example (and  example only , not a political statement), take a look at  urlLink www.blogsforbush.com .  There they are linking to other sites  not hosted by their server  but all related to a common theme: Re-electing Bush.  Why couldn't the aiesec.ws server operate in a similar way?  Such that the  urlLink aiesec.ws mainpage  would show Recently Updated weblogs from its own server, but also from those individuals who have asked to be linked and tracked as well?  I'm not a techie.  But it seems like an awfully simple solution to me.

      This was written by Ted Nugent, the rock singer and hunter/naturalist, upon hearing that California Senators B. Boxer and D. Feinstein denounced him for being a "gun owner" and a "Rock Star." This was his response after telling the senators about his past contributions to children's charities and scholarship foundations which have totaled more than $13.7 million in the last 5 years!   "I'm a Bad American - this pretty much sums it up for me.  I like big trucks, big boats, big houses, and naturally, pretty women. I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not some midlevel governmental functionary with a bad comb-over who wants to give it away to crack addicts squirting out babies.  "I don't care about appearing compassionate.  I think playing with toy guns doesn't make you a killer.  I believe ignoring your kids and giving them Prozac might.  "I think I'm doing better than the homeless.  I don't think being a minority makes you noble or victimized.  I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are different, weird or make me mad.  This is my life to live, and not necessarily up to others expectations.  "I know what sex is and there are not varying degrees of it.  "I don't celebrate Kwanza.  But if you want to that's fine. I just don't feel like everyone else should have to.  "I believe that if you are selling me a Dairy Queen shake, a pack of cigarettes, or hotel room you do it in English.  As of matter of fact, if you are an American citizen you should speak English.  My uncles and forefathers shouldn't have had to die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born in to come disrespect ours, and make us bend to your will.  Get over it!  "I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry butt if you're running from them after they tell you to stop.  If you can't understand the word 'Freeze!' or 'Stop!' in English, see the previous line.  "I don't use the excuse 'It's for the children' as a shield for unpopular opinions or actions.  "I know how to count votes and I feel much safer letting a machine with no political affiliation do a recount when needed.  "I know what the definition of lying is, and it isn't based on the word 'is' - ever.  "I don't think just because you were not born in this country, you qualify for any special loan programs, government-sponsored bank loans, etc., so you can open a hotel, 7-Eleven, trinket shop, or any thing else, while the indigenous peoples can't get past a high school education because they can't afford it.  "I didn't take the initiative in inventing the Internet.  "I thought the Taco Bell dog was funny.  "I want them to bring back safe and sane fireworks.  "I believe no one ever died because of something Ozzy Osbourne, Ice-T or Marilyn Manson sang, but that doesn't mean I want to listen to that crap from someone else's car when I'm stopped at a red light.  But I respect your right to.  "I think that being a student doesn't give you any more enlightenment than working at Blockbuster or Jack In The Box.  "I don't want to eat or drink anything with the words light, lite or fat-free on the package.  "Our soldiers did not go to some foreign country and risk their lives in vain and defend our Constitution so that decades later you can tell me it's a living document ever changing and is open to interpretation.  The guys who wrote it were light years ahead of anyone today, and they meant what they said - now leave the document alone, or there's going to be trouble.  "I don't hate the rich.  I help the poor.  "I know wrestling is fake.  "I've never owned a slave, or was a slave, and a large percentage of our forefathers weren't wealthy enough to own one either.  Please stop blaming me because some prior white people were idiots - and remember, tons of white, Indian, Chinese, and other races have been enslaved too - it was wrong for every one of them.  Get over it!  "I believe a self-righteous liberal Democrat with a cause is more dangerous than a Hell's Angel with an attitude.  "I want to know exactly which church is it where the 'Reverend' Jessie Jackson preaches and, what exactly is his job function.  "I own a gun, you can own a gun, and any red-blooded American should be allowed to own a gun, but if you use it in a crime, then you will serve the time.  "I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made and continue to make more.  If it makes you mad, then invent the next operating system that's better and put your name on the building.  Ask your buddy that invented the Internet to help you.  "I don't believe in hate crime legislation.  Even suggesting it makes me mad.  You're telling me that someone who is a minority, gay, disabled, another nationality, or otherwise different from the mainstream of this country has more value as a human being that I do as a white male.  If someone kills anyone, I'd say that it's a hate crime.  We don't need more laws!  Let's enforce the ones we already have.  "I think turkey bacon, turkey beef, turkey fake anything sucks. I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child - it takes a parent with the guts to stand up to the kid and spank his butt and say 'NO!' when it's necessary to do so.  "I'll admit that the only movie that ever made me cry was Old Yeller.  "I didn't realize Dr. Seuss was a genius until I had a kid.  "I will not be frowned upon or be looked down upon or be made to keep silent because I have these beliefs and opinions.  I thought this country allowed me that right.  I will not conform or compromise just to keep from hurting somebody's feelings.  I'm neither angry nor disenfranchised, no matter how desperately the mainstream media would like the world to believe otherwise.  "Yes, I guess by some people's definition, I may be a bad American.  But that's tough.  Get Over it!"

      This is a letter from Ray Reynolds, a medic in the Iowa Army National Guard, serving in Iraq:  As I head off to Baghdad for the final weeks of my stay in Iraq, I wanted to say thanks to all of you who did not believe the media. They have done a very poor job of covering everything that has happened.Â  I am sorry that I have not been able to visit all of you during my two week leave back home.Â  And just so you can rest at night knowing something is happening in Iraq that is noteworthy, I thought I would pass this on to you.Â  This is the list of things that has happened in Iraq recently: (Please share it with your friends and compare it to the version that your paper is producing.)  * Over 400,000 kids have up-to-date immunizations. * School attendance is up 80% from levels before the war. * Over 1,500 schools have been renovated and rid of the weapons stored there so education can occur. * The port of Uhm Qasar was renovated so grain can be off-loaded from ships faster. * The country had its first 2 billion barrel export of oil in August. * Over 4.5 million people have clean drinking water for the first time ever in Iraq. * The country now receives 2 times the electrical power it did before the war. * 100% of the hospitals are open and fully staffed, compared to 35% before the war. * Elections are taking place in every major city, and city councils are in place. * Sewer and water lines are installed in every major city. * Over 60,000 police are patrolling the streets. * Over 100,000 Iraqi civil defense police are securing the country. * Over 80,000 Iraqi soldiers are patrolling the streets side by side with US soldiers. * Over 400,000 people have telephones for the first time ever. * Students are taught field sanitation and hand washing techniques to prevent the spread of germs. * An interim constitution has been signed. * Girls are allowed to attend school. * Textbooks that don't mention Saddam are in the schools for the first time in 30 years.  Don't believe for one second that these people do not want us there. I have met many, many people from Iraq that want us there, and in a bad way. They say they will never see the freedoms we talk about but they hope their children will.Â  We are doing a good job in Iraq and I challenge anyone, anywhere to dispute me on these facts.Â  So If you happen to run into John Kerry, be sure to give him my email address and send him to Denison, Iowa. This soldier will set him straight. If you are like me and very disgusted with how this period of rebuilding has been portrayed, email this to a friend and let them know there are good things happening.  Ray Reynolds, SFC Iowa Army National Guard 234th Signal Battalion

      A lesson I'm still learning 4 years later.  You see, there are a couple of people who have come into my life whom I just CAN NOT forgive.  And I know I have to. And I try to tell myself that I have.  And it's just so hard.  Then I read this today in my online scripture message:   Let's get real here. There is no way that people who have wronged you can ever repay you what they have taken from you. You just have to let it go. Forgiveness means to let it go! You have to decide to cancel that debt. They can't repay the years of hurt. Even if they wanted to, they couldn't.  Jesus said in Mark 11:24-26, "Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them. And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses, but if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses."   I have to let it go.  I have to let  her  go.  Because she's not part of my life anymore.  And I can't get back the time that she took from me.  It's in the past.  Let it go, Cat.  Just let it go...

      As you either know (because you know  me ) or could guess by reading my grumblings here  urlLink here , my executive assistant (EA from now on) is a large pain in my ass.  I think she has now made it her mission in life to make my worklife  miserable .    Between the incessant LOUD personal phone calls on company lines, cell phone calls, changing ring tones on her cell phone, writing papers for her night class and other irritating things that obviously should not be done on work time, she still manages to piss me off by shirking responsibility for anything and everything, asking stupid questions and being incompetent in general.  Therefore, I have decided that I must devise a way to kill her.    But, be warned, I like my job and my life...so I can't get caught.  Monday I was thinking that death by suffocation from her own cell phone being shoved down her throat would be appropriate.  Today I'm thinking it may be more fun to incorporate a stapler.  Any ideas out there?

      Why is it that the first half of the day always seems to fly by without much consequence, but the afternoon drags on and on and on....  It seems as if the clock will never turn to 12:00.  The true 1/2 way through the day mark, some encouragement.  Then once it does, it seems like each 5 minute interval between 12:00 and 4:00 tick slowly by.  GRR!  I just wanna go outside and enjoy the sunshine.  I know I could get some quality yardwork done in weather like this: mid 70's and sunny.  My kind of day.  But alas, the phone beckons me: "Dial! Dial!

      From the  urlLink NY Times :  urlLink Less to Memorize, More to Learn; U.S. Is Rewriting Citizenship Test    "Like the current exam, the replacement will test applicants in two areas: proficiency in English and knowledge of United States history and government. A major intent  is to make sure the exams are administered uniformly. The new test will also try to ensure that prospective citizens understand basic concepts of American democracy and are not merely reciting facts by rote."    Looks like Craig's got his work cut out for him when he finally gets around to taking this puppy.  No more memorizing, you say? Well, that's not very American!

       Cute forward I got earlier today...   The liquid inside young coconuts can be used as substitute for blood plasma.   No piece of paper can be folded in half more than 7 times.   Donkeys kill more people annually than plane crashes.   The king of hearts is the only king without a moustache.   Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise.   Apples, not caffeine, are more efficient at waking you up in the morning.   The plastic things on the end of shoelaces are called aglets.   Most dust particles in your house are made from dead skin.   The first owner of the Marlboro Company died of lung cancer.   Pearls melt in vinegar.   The three most valuable brand names on earth: Marlboro,Coca-Cola, and Budweiser, in that order.   It is possible to lead a cow upstairs...but not downstairs.   A duck's quack doesn't echo and no one knows why.   Turtles can breathe through their butts.   On average, 100 people choke to death on ball-point pens every year.   Elephants are the only animals that can't jump.   Women blink nearly twice as much as men.   It's physically impossible for you to lick your elbow.   The Main Library at Indiana University sinks over an inch every year because when it was built, engineers failed to take into account the weight of all the books that would occupy the building.   A snail can sleep for three years.   No word in the English language rhymes with "MONTH."   Our eyes are always the same size from birth, but our nose and ears never stop growing.   All polar bears are left handed.   A crocodile cannot stick its tongue out.   Almost everyone who reads this will try to lick their elbow.

      I'm loving this summer.&nbsp; Finally, I've found time to just relax and enjoy the peace and quiet of losing myself in a good book.&nbsp; Recently, I've read two worth mentioning:  &nbsp;   Angels and Demons , by Dan Brown  &nbsp;  and  &nbsp;   The Notebook , by Nicholas Sparks.  &nbsp;  I read Angels and Demons first.&nbsp; After hearing endless rants from other people about the wonder of his writing, I decided to check it out for myself. Figured it would be a good distraction on my Atlanta business trip last week.&nbsp; Consider me a believer. His style has a way captivating the reader. Once you start, be forewarned that it will be difficult to put the book down.&nbsp; When it's over, you'll wish that there were more.&nbsp; Just ask Craig, he started reading it last night and will likely finish it by this evening.&nbsp; All 572 pages.&nbsp; Highly recommended.  &nbsp;  After cruising through  Angels and Demons , I had nothing left to read on my way home from Atlanta so I picked up  The Notebook  at the&nbsp;airport.&nbsp; The book is good and short (only 213 pages).&nbsp; A bit fluffy and romantic for my taste, but Sparks touched a nerve with the following passage:  &nbsp;   "And I learned what is obvious to a child.&nbsp; That life is simply a collection of little lives, each lived one day at a time.&nbsp; That each day should be spent finding beauty in flowers and poetry and talking to animals.&nbsp; That a day spent with dreaming and sunsets and refreshing breezes cannot be bettered.&nbsp; But most of all, I learned that life is about sitting on benches next to ancient creeks with my hand on her knee and sometimes, on good days, for falling in love."   &nbsp;  Verdict on  The Notebook : Recommended for romantics only.  &nbsp;  Next on my list:  The DaVinci Code , by Dan Brown...I told you I couldn't get enough of him!

      (forwarded message)  It's not that we as intelligent voters didn't already know this but, someone took the time to dig up some stats and looky here !!  I don't think that John Kerry approves of this message because it's a matter of simple fact and public record!! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Shortly after reading the following e-mail content, I happened to look at the label of a jar of Heinz sandwich slice pickles. Yep.... Made in Mexico. Check some of your Heinz products.   "Sen. John Kerry keeps talking about U.S. corporations leaving this country and setting up shop in foreign countries, taking thousands of jobs with them. He is right, because that has happened. However, he is trying to blame it on  George W. Bush.    "That cannot be said about Kerry and his wife, Teresa Heinz-Kerry.   "According to the Wall Street Journal, the Kerry's own 32 factories in  Europe and 18 in Asia and the Pacific. In addition, their company, the Heinz Company, leases four factories in Europe and four in Asia. Also, they own 27 factories in North America, some of which are in Mexico and the Caribbean. 80% of Heinz products are made overseas. I wonder how many hundreds of American workers lost their jobs when these plants relocated in foreign countries. I also wonder if the workers in Mexico and Asia are paid the same wages and benefits as workers in the United States. Of course they're not. However, Kerry demands that other companies that relocate should pay the same benefits they did in the U.S. Why does he not demand this of the Heinz Company, since he is married to the owner?   "If (choke) Kerry is ever elected, will he and his wife close all those foreign factories and bring all those jobs back to America?   "Of course they won't. They're making millions off that cheap labor."

      Funniest joke I've heard in ages!  Had me just about off my chair laughing....  ~~~~~~ Calling in sick to work makes me uncomfortable.  No matter how legitimate  my excuse, I always get the feeling that my boss thinks I'm lying. On  one recent occasion, I had a valid reason but lied anyway, because the truth was just too darned humiliating. I simply mentioned that I had sustained a head injury, and I hoped I would feel up to coming in the  next day. By then, I reasoned, I could think up  a doozy to explain the  bandage on the top of my head.  The accident occurred mainly because I had given in to my wife's wishes  to adopt a cute little kitty. Initially, the new acquisition was no  problem. Then one morning, I was taking my shower after breakfast when I heard my  wife, Deb, call out to me from the kitchen.  "Honey! The garbage disposal is dead again. Please come reset it." "You know where the button is," I protested through the shower pitter-patter and steam. "Reset it yourself!"  "But I'm scared!" she persisted. "What if it starts going and sucks me in?" There was a meaningful pause and then, "C'mon, > it'll only take you a second."  So out I came, dripping wet and buck naked, hoping that my silent outraged nudity would make a statement about how I perceived her behavior as extremely cowardly. Sighing loudly, I squatted down and stuck my head under the sink to find the button.  It is the last action I remember performing  It struck without warning, and without any respect to my circumstances.  No, it wasn't the hexed disposal, drawing me  into its gnashing metal  teeth.  It was our new kitty, who discovered the fascinating dangling objects  she spied hanging between my legs. She had been poised around the corner and stalked me as I reached under the sink.  And, at the precise moment when I was most vulnerable, she leapt at the toys I unwittingly offered and snagged them with her needle-like claws. I lost all rational thought to control orderly  bodily movements, blindly rising at a violent rate of speed, with the full  weight of a kitten hanging from my masculine region.   Wild animals are sometimes faced with a fight or flight syndrome. Men,  in this predicament, choose only the "flight" option. I know this from experience.  I was fleeing straight up into the  air when the sink and  cabinet bluntly and forcefully impeded my ascent. The impact knocked me out cold. When I awoke, my wife and the paramedics stood over me. Now there are not many things in this life worse than finding oneself lying on the kitchen floor buck naked in front of a group of "been-here, done-that" paramedics. Even worse, having been fully briefed by my  wife, the paramedics were  all snorting loudly as they tried to conduct their work, all the while trying to suppress their hysterical laughter.... and not succeeding. Somehow I lived through it all. A few days later  I finally made it back in to the office, where colleagues tried to coax  an explanation out of me about my head injury. I kept silent, claiming  it was too painful to "What's the matter?" They all asked, "Cat got your tongue?"  If they only knew...

      We knew very early on that we had a racoon living in our backyard.  We  urlLink saw him  the first week we moved in and named him "Peety".  A few weeks later we heard some screetching and suspected that Peety had found a mate.  Although we never saw both of them together, we named her "Patti".  Almost every day and at least every week, I see Peety or Patti hanging out in our backyard...climbing down the tree around 5 or 6 in the evening or scouting around the edges of the yard for something to play with or eat.  Although we don't feed them, we have accepted that they have been living on our lot longer than we have (their residence is the large 200+ year old oak tree in the middle of the backyard), and deserve to be left alone to live in peace.  Today, our suspicions that there were more than just Peety living in the tree were confirmed.  This morning we saw the newest addition to the Coon family: Munchkin...a baby Coon.  He's so little!  He was hanging out in the backyard with Patti when I was watering my flowers.    As long as they continue to stay out of the house, garage and garbage, the Coons and the Dawsons will continue to be able to live in peace.

      Finding new sites and places in the blogsphere since leaving the AIESEC server.  Most recently had a friend direct me to  urlLink The Real Live Preacher :   ...the bible is not a self-help book full of easy answers, but a book of stories and wisdom that is meant to lead us into relationship and worship. There are hard and fast truths in it, yes, but they are surrounded by soft truths, and slippery truths, and sometimes truths, and truths that once were true but are no longer true, and truths that are only true if you are in the right state of mind, and truths that are only true if you are not hurting someone, and truths that are true in the moment but not if you are talking about the moment, and truths that can only be lived and should never be spoken, and truths that we cannot hear, and truths that are more than we can bear.  The truths of the bible are utterly beyond anyone who seeks to own truth and who seeks truth above the Spirit of God.   I think I've found a new place to hang out.

      Man, does Leno have some good shots!   "President Bush listed his income as $822,000. You know what John Kerry calls someone who earns $822,000? Not even worth dating."  -Jay Leno   "Well, the good news for Democrats: over half the country can now identify a picture of John Kerry. The bad news is that the majority still  thinks he's the dad from 'The Munsters'"  -Jay Leno   "John Kerry accused President Bush of catering to the rich. You know, as opposed to John Kerry who just marries them."  -Jay Leno   "They say John Kerry is the first Democratic presidential candidate in history to raise $50 million in a three-month period. Actually, that's nothing. He once raised $500 million with two words: 'I do.'"  -Jay Leno   "John Kerry will undergo surgery to repair his right shoulder. He originally hurt it when he suddenly switched positions on Iraq."  -Craig Kilborn   "Today, John Kerry announced a foolproof plan to wipe out the $500B deficit. John Kerry has a plan, he's going to put it on his wife's Gold Card."  -Craig Kilborn   "The Secret Service has announced it is doubling its protection for John Kerry. You can understand why...with two positions on every issue, he has twice as many people mad at him."  -Jay Leno   "The White House has begun airing their TV commercials to re-elect the president, and the John Kerry campaign is condemning his use of 9/11 in the ads. He said it is unconscionable to use the tragic memory of a war in order to get elected, unless of course, it's the Vietnam War."  -Jay Leno   "John Kerry has promised to take this country back from the wealthy. Who better than the guy worth $700 million to take the country back? See, he knows how the wealthy think. He can spy on them at his country club, at his place in Palm Beach, at his house in the Hamptons. He's like a mole for the working man."  -Jay Leno   "John Kerry: the Democratic nominee for president. Democrats finally found someone who is Al Gore without the flash and the sizzle."  -Craig Kilborn   "Yesterday Senator John Kerry changed his mind and now supports the ban on gay marriages. I'm telling you this guy has more positions than Paris Hilton."  -David Letterman   "It really kind of looks like now that John Kerry is on his way to the presidential nomination, the only thing that can sink John Kerry now is an Al Gore endorsement."  -Jay Leno   "According to a new study, Botox injections can help back pain. So you see, that's why John Kerry had all that Botox. His back was killing him from all that flip-flopping on issues."  -Jay Leno   "The head of the AFL-CIO endorsed John Kerry, saying, 'The time has come to come behind one man, one leader, one candidate.' Then he said, 'And until we find that man, we will endorse John Kerry.'"  -Conan O'Brien   "In his big victory speech, Senator Kerry said that he wanted to defeat George Bush and the 'economy of privilege.' Then he hugged his wife, Teresa, heir to the multi-million dollar Heinz food fortune."  -Jay Leno

      I figured it out last week.   Few people can get me really 'worked up'.  For the most part these days, I'm a even-keeled person.  Except when it comes to a particular people...and two specifically.  And then last Wednesday, it came to me.  Both my executive assistant and this particular woman at our church are remarkably similar:  They're both passive-aggressive.  I'm confrontational.  If you've got something to say, just say it. Don't pussyfoot around.  They're both rule mongers.  To a fault.  There are particular procedures and rules that must be followed to do anything.  I generally don't care about the  how  as long as IT gets done.  They both display an air of moral authority.  As if the way that they practice and observe their faith is superior to everyone else.  And, mainly, the characteristics that they share above results in me getting frustrated with them on at least a weekly basis.  There's more frequent frustration with the EA because I have to see her just about every day.  But I can't recall a time that I've had to be at a church meeting with the other woman and haven't returned home completely aggitated.  Well, at least I'm consistent.  And it was comforting to me somehow to be able to identify this.

      Took me a while, but I had to get back to commenting about  urlLink Zoot 's  urlLink drama  with the " urlLink Neighors from Hell ".    I had a similar experience growing up in La Crosse.  We moved to a cramped 2 bedroom apartment in the city from a sprawling 2 bedroom ranch house in the country when I was 9.  My mom was finishing up her degree at  urlLink Viterbo  and the hour commute to and from every day after work was killing her.  I hated it from the beginning...it was dirty, small and there were boundaries of where it was 'safe' to play.  The park 2 blocks from our apartment had at least 5 shootings one summer.  But we couldn't afford anything bigger or nicer or in a different neighborhood.    So we stayed.   For 6 years.   Until we got our own the Neighbors from Hell:  They were a doped up couple who constantly foughtand rented the unit above ours.  She was nice enough to me, but he always seemed to be drunk or doped up.  Then one night, after bar time, they had a fight and she wouldn't let him back in our security locked building.  They had an hour-long screaming match from the parking lot to her bedroom window (directly above ours).  Then he went ballistic.  He rang all of the doorbells to every apartment in our building (no one let him in).  He smashed the windows on her car with his bare hands. And used the shards of glass to slash her tires.  Then came back and rang the doorbells again.  Finally, the police came and took him away.  I was 15 and terrified, but drifted back to sleep.  The scene the next morning when I left for school was horrific.  His blood (from all the glass) was all over our mailboxes, doorbells, sidewalks, railings, side of the house,  everywhere .    We moved to a new apartment less than a week later.  We always knew that we lived in a dangerous neighborhood, but it really hit home that night.  My mom still lives in the apartment that we moved into that week.  It's in a quiet, safe neighborhood.  But we know what life is like in the ghetto.  And it aint pretty.  And that was only La Crosse, WI.  I can't imagine what kinds of things children see everyday in bigger cities like LA and Chicago...
