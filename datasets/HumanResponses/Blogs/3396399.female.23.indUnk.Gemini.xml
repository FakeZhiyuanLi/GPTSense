        Gemini       Gemini, the third sign of the zodiac, symbolized by twins. Astrologers consider people whose birthdays fall between May 21 and June 21 to be born under the sun sign of Gemini. The planet Mercury, named after the ancient Roman messenger god, rules Gemini, which is an air sign.  According to astrologers, Geminis tend to be quick-witted, changeable, talkative, versatile, and sometimes crafty or mischievous, with strong communication skills. Geminis are known for their ability to express themselves, and are witty, clever, and often well-read. They usually have something to say about everything. Astrologers believe that typical Geminis have highly developed intellects, and that they place greater importance on learning than on emotional or practical issues. However, they consider Geminis to be so clever that they can give the impression of deep emotion or of the practicality of their desires.  Astrologers believe Geminis have the ability, and often the need, to do more than one thing at a time. Geminis are so interested in everything that they get bored easily and often cannot resist moving on to the next subject, tendencies which can make them seem shallow and fickle. Professions associated with the sign Gemini include teaching, journalism, publishing, sales, and other professions that require verbal skills and flexibility.

      Well boys and girls, this edition of Gayfag is written especially for little old rachie here, and I must say I’m a little rusty, I haven’t written for a few months.  But anyway lets get on with the show…and I hear a sharp intake of breath as you anticipate the emergence of my latest tirade.   Breathe out motherfucker, I don’t need your appraisal your anticipation or even your remote interest.  You will read what I have to say regardless.  Because I am that damn cool.  So what has interested me and fallen under the gaze of my oh so critical eye this month?  Well if you must know, in my spare time when I should have been revising I was reading trashy tabloids and marvelling at the activities of the once so perfect David Beckham.  Now before you roll your eyes and claim to have heard it before…listen to me.  This is not a piece about David and his fucking stick insect of a wife (fuck man I just wanna take her to KFC and shove food down her neck until she fucking chokes the little faggot bitch).  No quite the contrary, this piss poor couple were merely the catalyst for my current annoyance, my topic is that of monogamy.    I am currently finding myself in the situation where one man is simply not enough, however I am entirely convinced that I am not alone.  Once women reach the stage of a relationship where the man sees fit to fart, scratch his balls, or take a shit in front of you, I’m not the only one who experiences the fight or flight response.  In case you are interested I always go with the latter.  I will never be so comfortable with someone as to sit and gaze adoringly whilst the object of my affections sleeps with his gob wide open and several gallons of spit flowing onto my freshly washed pillows.  The feelings of disgust are too strong.  Yeah back to the point and leaving the tangent…men I have relationships with piss me off.  You take me for granted, make a mess on my bed, MY BED – I HAVE TO SLEEP THERE WHEN YOU ARE GONE YOU KNOW, and expect me to jump on your gdam dick just because its hard in the morning.  Then you have the nerve to call me a prudish bitch because I’m tired.  Well guess what? If I didn’t have to put so much fucking energy into faking it all the time, I’d have enough to jump on your fucking cock first thing, so who’s fault is it that I go looking elsewhere now?  *breathes*  So anyway, the whole point of this piece is to say that I don’t blame the guy for shopping around ya know? I’m sure men are just as annoyed by women waving their tampons in front of them or whatever, so they probably share my view, just with re-application.   There is clearly a moral to this little rant my dears.  And that is, fuck around, get as much as you can, cuz when you’re old your genitalia will be dangling around your ankles and no amount of prescribed drugs can save you then. (Of course if you are as whorish as let’s say Jordan…you probably have fanny flaps the size of Africa anyway so who gives a shit?). In conclusion this is my advice to you, screw around but be safe, we don’t want any more little whores running around repeating their parents mistakes now do we?   Ty Kriztalie Dear :) haha@the faking it part

      This is gonna change often, i have a different fascination every other day. Hey, short attention span, but it keeps life interesting.     This is my current fascination, James Valentine (i  think  anyways.. lol :|) My favourite song at the moment is "This Love" by his Band, Maroon5  Call me "Gay"...i don't care!   I was so high i did not recognise, the fire burning in her eyes, The chaos that controlled my mind. She said Goodbye, and she got on a plane, Never to return again, But always in my heart.  This love has taken it's toll on Me, she's said Goodbye, Too many times before. And her heart is breaking infront of me, and i have no choice, Cuz i won't say Goodbye anymore.  I tried my best to feed her appetite, Keep her coming every night, So hard to keep her satisfied. Kept playing Love like it was just a game, pretending to feel the same, But then turn around and leave again.  This love has taken it's toll on Me, she's said Goodbye, Too many times before. And her heart is breaking infront of me, and i have no choice, Cuz i won't say Goodbye anymore.  I'll Fix These Broken Things,  Repair Your Broken Wings, And Make Sure Everything's Alright My Pressure on Your Hips,  I Sink In My Finger Tips, In Every Inch Of You, Cuz I Know That's What You Want Me To Do.  This love has taken it's toll on Me, she's said Goodbye, Too many times before. And her heart is breaking infront of me, and i have no choice, Cuz i won't say Goodbye anymore.  This love has taken it's toll on Me, she's said Goodbye, Too many times before. And My heart is breaking infront of me, she's said Goodbye, Too many times before.    Usually my song of the moment applies to a situation i'm in, but not this one. I don't really know why i like it, it's just catchy

      Your birth date describes who we are, what we are good at and what our inborn abilities are. It also points to what we have to learn and the challenges we are facing.    To figure out your Birth Number, add all the numbers in the birth Date together, like in the example, until there is only one digit. A Birth Number does not prevent you from being anything you want to be, it will just color your choice differently and give you a little insight.        Example March 20, 1950       3 + 20 + 1950 = 1973       1 + 9 + 7 + 3 = 20       2 + 0 = 2  Keep going until you end up with a single digit number. 2 is the Birth Number to read for the birth date in the example.         #1 THE ORIGINATOR #2 THE PEACEMAKER #3 THE LIFE OF THE PARTY #4 THE CONSERVATIVE #5 THE NONCONFORMIST #6 THE ROMANTIC  #7 THE INTELLECTUAL #8 THE BIG SHOT #9 THE PERFORMER              ==================================   19 06 1981  19 + 6 + 1981 = 2006  2 + 0 + 0 + 6 = 8   # 8 - THE BIG SHOT   8's are the problem solvers.  They are professional, blunt and to the point, have good judgment and are decisive.   They have grand plans and like to live the good life.   They take charge of people.   They view people objectively.   They let you know in no uncertain terms that they are the boss. They should learn to exude their decisions on their own needs rather than on what others want.  Famous 8's: Edgar Cayce, Barbra Streisand, George Harrison, Jane Fonda, Pablo Picasso, Aretha Franklin, Nostrodamus, and Ron Connolly (Bragger!!!!!!!)    woo!

           People who change the rules half way through a card game.    What the Hell is all that about? It's just a form of CHEATING!  And then they bitch at me, cuz i'm bitching about the rules being changed??  What about when it was my turn, if i'd of changed the rules, I COULD OF WON!!!!  *throws cards in a tantrum*    People who block the Right Of Way.    Excuse me plz.  Excuse me plz...  ARE YOU GONNA GET OUT OF THE WAY OR WHAT??    Shop Assistants who don't let you just Look At Stuff    ....    Women who Shout at thier Kids in the Street    This really makes me cringe.  You only make an embarassment out of yourself, and your child.  Why?  If you kept your children under control in the First Place, there'd be no need to to Shout at Them.  Shut the Fuck Up Already.             Ok, i'm done.  For Now.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      To London, but not to see the Queen!   Missions for the day included: Seeing the Sarcophagus's at the British Museum, Having Lunch in Ladbroke Grove with the Rastaferians, Soho and Harrods.  3 out of 4 aint bad, considering we also visited Portobello Road Market, and China Town.   The Train journey was cool, it took about three hours, and it allowed me to have Alcohol before 8am. This is The route:     Newcastle to Kings Cross, with a few stops inbetween.  The only other interesting passengers tho, was a bunch of Saint John's Ambulance kids..   From Kings Cross, we took the Tube to Russel Square, and headed for the museum, we passed through Russel Park, and laughed at the smackheads who were passed out on the grass. Some old guy passed us and he was wearing a mink coat with these leather sandals, pretty pimp i reckoned.   Anyways, This was our destination:     The place is really Huge, This pic only shows like, the middle third of it. You'd need about three days to see everything that's on exhibit.   We only wanted to see mummies!         we also saw sphinx's and other cool shit      When we were done, we stood outside with Irish reporters, ooo they were fantastic! They were wearing three piece suits and Trilby hats and they had a lead on Prince William, who had apparently made a phone call from a box near the Museum, talking about heading into Soho. Cool, aye.   Next stop was the Market on Portobello Road, it stretches for ever.     The day we went, it was an Antique Market and there was loads of stuff to look at.  But what did we buy?? A couple of fridge magnets, Lol.. mine looks like this:      At the top end of Portobello Rd, is Ladbroke Grove, where we had Chicken and chirizzo salad, at a place called Uncles.     It was very good, 5/5! It was a huge serving also.   We stayed at Uncles for a bit, and just enjoyed watching a lot of very pretty foreign people walk back and forth, No one who lives in London is actually English it seems.   Next Stop was Soho! But we had to get to Piccadilly Circus first.  For me, who's a small town girl whose never been anywhere remotely exciting, Piccadilly Circus was just.. Fantastic        That's the statue of Eros  Pictures don't do it justice, you have to be there and feel the buzz of it.   Soho was class. We sat and had coffee opposite a XXX video store, and watched while a few sleazy men went in and out with carrier bags. There were loads of people, but it was quiet, and we just strolled around, there was market here also.  Then we rounded a corner and..  GAY PRIDE, WOO!@  We were met with sights such as..     and..     hmm..     i could go on forever..Lol.   And having to squeeze our way through all the men, was.. hard work.      China Town was really great! It's mainly Restaurants, but there's a few little gift shops, where i bought a lovely little handbeaded kittykat purse and an oriental fan.         And after we had something to eat.. it was time to head back to Kings Cross, alas.   The ride home was actually pretty great. A seat across from us was reserved, and of course, it had to be a weirdo who was sitting there. A weirdo who thought that my friend and i were lesbians and had been to London for Gay Pride all because.. We had the same colour tops on. I swear! These were his own words.. "you mean you aren't lesbians?..but you have the same top on.." He was bizarre.   Anyways, that was Day, and i can't wait to go back!
