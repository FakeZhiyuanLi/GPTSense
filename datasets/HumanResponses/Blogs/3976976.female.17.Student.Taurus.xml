      Here is a poem iI found online... and i liked it so much i put it here for yall to read...   &nbsp; Time By Â©Ginny&nbsp;Storm Time is sleeping softly now,  As though it will never awaken;  And here, now, in this moment,  My heart is being taken. &nbsp;This day will last forever,  Though I know that it's only a day.  And soon, you will have left me,  Like a cloud floating away.  And yet, time is looking right at us,  And this hour will never end.  But time is ever cruel-hearted,  And like a thief, is stealing my friend.  This second will last an eternity,  As seconds sometimes do;  And I can say that I have spent Eternity with you.  One moment can last a lifetime,  And though we soon will part,  I vow that I will always love This thief that stole my heart.

       &nbsp;Jeff's poem  &nbsp;  &nbsp;If you knew how i felt  &nbsp;how everything is good  &nbsp;would your heart come to mine&nbsp;  would this turn out right&nbsp;  if you knew the way i felt&nbsp;  the way you make me smile&nbsp;  if you knew this heart of mine&nbsp;  would you come to me&nbsp;  would you be mine&nbsp;  why cant i tell you everything  &nbsp;tell you whats inside&nbsp;  would you rip this heart of mine&nbsp;  would you make me cry&nbsp;  please try your best&nbsp;  please try to see&nbsp;  the things that i may hide&nbsp;  the things i cant get out to you  the things&nbsp;that are&nbsp;inside.  If only you could view me from where im standing at  the light you've placed inside me  its here its shining bright  if only you could see this different side of me  would you come for me  would you put out the light  would we be happy  could this be right  could it go wrong  would the light quit shining  would the warmth be gone  dont let it get cold  if i let you inside  this heart  this soul of mine  i wish i could tellyou  tell you so much  tell you the way i feel your touch  can you see my smile  can you see how i feel  If you knew how i felt  how everything is good  would your heart come to mine&nbsp;  would this turn out right&nbsp;

      I wish to feel you just one more time  the way my heart was yours  i cant forget all the things  i can only think of them more  we were so happy  so close  but i keep thinkin about yesterday  what went wrong  where did we get lost  how can everything change so fast  why does everything have to be about you  why cant you just erase  everything you did  everything you said  can we turn around  and do this all again  rewrite this perfect ending  make it work  make it happen  but i keep thinking about yesterday  what went wrong  where did we get lost  this would be so easy  if we would just try  keep getting off track  lets keep it straight  lets throw it all away  lets just start over  once more  again  lets come together  hold my hand  but i keep thinking about yesterday  what went wrong  where did we get lost  This will never end  the fights  the argument  can we start over  can this shit end  lets quit thinking  lets just quit  i get it  we're done  its over  its over  cant stop thinking about yesterday  that is whats wrong  that is where i get lost

      Well.. i hate to bitch right now but i have to.. I just hate when people are always wanting pity.. They are always so fuckin negative.. " oh I'm Ugly, You don't have to lie." Stuff like that.. when someone tells you you aren't but yet every time you have the chance you're like.. No I'm not.. blah blah... Really how is that attractive.. if you want attention well that is just not the way to get it... If i like you for you.. be happy for that.. shit, you don't want to end up getting on my bad side.. I like people for being themselves.. being secure about the person they are and the person they are choosing to be.. faults, and "ugliness" and all... Sometimes i really don't understand, do you just like hearing other people compliment you to make you feel better?? I mean seriously.. if i tell you you are hot or you are just the greatest person to be around.. then take that and be happy... Guys can be so self conscious about everything.. girls are too.. but self confidence.. maybe just a little can be attractive to anyone.. well to me.. knowing a guy can hold their own.. well thats good! Well thats all i have to say.. Ill be on tonight to write somethin new.. hopefully inspiration will strike and I'll write a poem.

      A beautiful Mustang has never been tamed,  but now there's something wrong and there's only you to blame.  You caged her up, never to fly,  Among the other Mustangs, among another sky.  She looks out to the world wishing she was home,  To galop in the meadow where she can freely roam.  There are things that she cannot forget,  The smell of different flowers and how the sun may set.  Please let her go and let the Mustang free,  for the deeper meaning is the Mustangs&nbsp;truly me.  I've been caged up to many times before,  My wings have been clipped so i may never soar.  Hope is all I have but how far will it go,  There are things that i wish i could know.  Maybe one day&nbsp; you will finally see,  the damage you have caused me and the person I can't be,  I will strive on and do what i can do,  there is no point in always feeling blue.  I thank all my friends for always standing near.  And to my new friend of who i share a fear,  Fuck the world who hates us because we speak our mind,  but always be happy of the things that you may find.  live life today and let go of the past,  this life is truly wonderful but damn it goes to fast.   well.. i think thats as far as this poem can go.. my&nbsp; mind has quit thinkin and well it has a good length right now! thanks also for people who comment on these! Hopefully you appreciate things as they are, and if you see yourself in one of my " hate blogs" well maybe you have a better understandin why people may fuckin hate you.. im just speakin my mind and tellin you what others may be scared to say!&nbsp;

      Everything I see, Everything i do,  Somehow, remind me of you,  I loved you so much,  I cant forget your touch,  but I still want you out,  out of my mind,  out of my heart,  I need to move on,  experience something new,  But yet, all my thoughts lead back to you,  Everything I see, Everything i do,  Somehow remind me of you.  You're everything I've always wanted,  You're everything to me,  but slowly I am changing,  and im letting you leave.  Someday, Somehow,  Ill finally be over you!

      Man, I really don't know what hurts more, liking someone and cant having them, or trying to let go. I wish i knew why I let something stupid as a guy get to me, but it does, he does! I know i'm doing better now, I finally try to go out with other guys and well... now HE is in the back of my mind. When i see him, he is just another face in the crowd. He is not what I want, He doesnt like the outdoors, I love it and need a guy that will love that with me. He doesnt like to get dirty, I'd love to mudd wrestle with a guy someday, hopefully not just hopes of him falling will happen, but he will be falling emotionally too, for me! HE doesnt like animals, Animals are my life, eventually and hopefully my career. He hates the government, i want to marry into the military and one day work as a civilian on an Air Force Base. By pointing out all of what we dont have in common, well, each time i let go, peice by peice, because i know, hes not what im looking for. He doesnt speek his mind, he doesnt let me know. I want someone, who is comfortable in their skin, and they know to an extent want they want. I want someone who will never give up, and always push harder no matter what. I want an athlete to keep up with me, because everyone knows the hassle that I can be. Mr. Perfect or semi at that, maybe not perfect at all, but was meant for me, where are you! when will we finally be? are you here, or farther along the road? i'm willing to wait, because i know when i find you, i'll finally be happy.. for now, im just out for casual dating, because when we finally meet, you will stand out from the rest and it will be an unexplainable experience.. i just cant wait. till im finally there with you. No longer will pain and love go hand in hand.. you will erase that from my system, and show me what love is.  I am such a romantic but yet, you see the tough me! the one who can probably kick your ass, no I know I can kick your ass... Im Mayra and no one messes with me.... I've always held my own and&nbsp; I know who I am and what I can be. No guy will ever take that away, good or bad. I know ME!

      To think that I finally found a person who seems to understand where I am coming from can be so many miles away and only now I have found them. To think that I had years to get to know them, but waited until they were gone to finally talk. I thank the internet so much because with out it, I would not have the interesting conversations I have now. The fact the they are not afraid to say what they think, that we have things in common, it just makes me&nbsp;come to a realization that if you don't try to get to know a person while they are here, well, you may be missing out on having a friend. I am glad though that&nbsp; I never deleted the screen name and was able to find a friend, not mattering that we are so many miles apart. If only people here could cherish a friendship and realize that one day we will be going our own paths... they need to enjoy the presence of their friends now and be glad they are able to connect with that person. I guess all I want to get through is that I truly cherish all my friends, even when they fuck up. Realize your mistakes and apologize if need be, don't loose a friend over something stupid as being a fucking asshole!

      Doesn't it just bother people&nbsp;when&nbsp;friends think they can boss you around just because of the simple fact that they are your friends. How can you treat someone like that? That is a shitty way of expressing how grateful you are that they actually stand by you no matter what! I swear if I put a you (you know who you are) in the same situation you would&nbsp;leave or you would bitch back! If you are gonna treat someone like shit then don't get mad if they bitch.. they have the right to do so and you should wonder why they put up with all the shit... did it ever come to you that they maybe really want to be your friend and you should just cool it. If you are going to tell me to do something ask me nicely and I'll either respond nicely no or I might do it. The world does not revolve around you! Sometimes people can be such assholes, and even bigger shitheads when they blame you or something that happened by the way they are acting, quit fucking around... the problem is YOU! I can't take it for long.. either you treat me like I should be treated.. or FUCK off because someone else appreciates my Fuckin presence and friendship!

      well... thanks to a new found friend.. not really new to me.. but I'm finally gettin to know a little about him... i am startin my own journal "blog" thing. i find it interesing how people find it entertaining to here about another person's life experiences.. its like "reality web". I think its the fact that you are able to relate to what they are going through, a shitty day, falling in love, or just a regular day, we find it comforting that there is someone out there who is like us, someone who you feel understands you. The good thing about this too is that people dont know your ethnicity, sexual orientation, nothing, just what you want them too... you can have someone totally opposite of you understand you and that well, really blows me away!  &nbsp;  you dont know me, who i am,  who writes here everyday,  im here to spill you all my soul,  my life thats never ending.  I speak my heart and dont hold back,  I let you know the truth,  I'll offend you here someday,  but i dont really care,  you can bitch to me today,  and tell me that im wrong,  but these are my thoughts,  these are me,  and im not wanting you to like it,  just keep on reading if you wish,  you're shit just keep to you,  this page is mine you fucking whore,  emotions freely fly,  this is me,  cant you see,  so quit asking who am I!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      why cant you see.. the deeper side of me.. why cant you see.. that all my poems arent about past lust.. past relationships.. why cant you see that there is some who see this person i am.. these people.. i dont hold close.. when im in my skin.. because they are in theres too.. there skin and mine.. dont really click.. they wouldnt go together.. 2 drummers.. a fighter.. theyve taken the time.. to know me.. all of you.. know the skin.. and what i write.. pain.. and the love.. and what im scared of.. they know.. they relate.. they are naked here.. naked with me.. opened up.... and those who read this with all the deeper side.. dont smile with the last lines.. of nakedness.. but yet.. the skin they are in.. does smile.. the child side.. the people we create... but we.. we are diffeent.. we are one of kind.. we all express ourselves.. we all have a time to open and a time to close.. so you who cant see.. see the deeper me.. see whats really there.. then youve lost the touch.. youve lost yourself.. you are no longer a one of a kind.. you have become what society wants.. you have followed the footsteps of others.. but us we mark our own path.. we are the people you cant see

      do you hear it the voices from the past spoken softly in the night i hear it as the cool wind blows i hear it with a creeping chill running down my back the voices of wise the voices of old filling my head and dreams they know so much of life and death the answers to all questions all i hear is gentle whispers not to make out a word i hear it as the night is still i hear it when my eyes are closed just concentrate and stand still to make out the voice that takes me to a different world my lullaby for sleep do you hear it the voices from the past spoken softly in the night

      lets not speak about it ever agin lets not go down that road of what we are and come to be and how it started out every beginning must have an end the cruelty of life death to us is not an option its what we'll come to face we will meet it young or old some to be too soon some with pain and some without but always alone no one to help you no one to explain what is to become a heaven, paradise is what we think the pretty thoughts we made nothing is empty nothing is sad something we've never felt life is something we never have nothing until the day we die our final thoughts as breath grows slow as the heart will take its stop do you see a light or total darkness night do you see the face of god what is there for you if only these answers i could know this process wouldnt be so hard the fear of death the fear of end nothingness at all

      What Happened To Us? by Hoobastank Album : The Reason I thought it was too good to be true I found somebody who understands me Someone who would help me to get through And fill an emptiness I had inside me But you kept inside and I just denied Some things that we should have both said I knew it was too good to be true Cause I'm the only one who understands me What happened to us? We used to be so perfect Now we're lost and lonely What happened to us? And deep inside I wonder Did I loose my only? Remember they thought we were too young To really know what it takes to make it But we had survived off what we have done So we could show them all that they're mistaken But who could have known The lies that would grow Until we could see right through them Remember they knew we were too young We still don't know what it takes to make it What happened to us? We used to be so perfect Now we're lost and lonely What happened to us? And deep inside I wonder Did I loose my only one? We could've made it work We could've found a way We should've done our best to see another day But we kept it all inside until it was too late And now we're both alone The consequence we pay for throwing it all away For throwing it all away What happened to us? We used to be so perfect Now we're lost and lonely What happened to us? And deep inside I wonder Did I loose my only? What happened to us? What happened to us? What happened to us? What happened to us?

       Broken Promises   BY: Element Eighty   The day you left me There was a feeling I have never shown The day you told me There were the words that I have never known And now it's over so what's left that I should ever feel Cause since the day you left me I have been so alone And now we're left with broken promises My heart can't take no more And now we're left with broken promises My mind has had enough Deep inside me There are things that I have never told Burn inside me and noe i need to know Why are you trying to take everything away from me Well I'm begging you I'm here with nothing left to show Cause since the day you left me I have been so alone And now we're left with broken promises My heart can't take no more And now we're left with broken promises My mind has had enough Look at how you turned on me You run away and left me here with nothing to see I'm a man so turn around and say it to me Don't you think I've got something to say Look at how you turned on me You run away and left me here with nothing to see I'm a man so turn around and say it to me Don't you think I've got something to say Look at how you turned on me You run away and left me here with nothing to see I'm a man so turn around and say it to me Don't you think I've got something to say And now we're left with broken promises My heart can't take no more And now we're left with broken promises My mind has had enough And now we're left with broken promises My heart can't take no more And now we're left with broken promises My mind has had enough

      Well was it there to say... i have no inspiration in writing a poem because frankly my mind isn't all here.. Dont you find it uncomfortable when you are somewhere with your long time ago ex but now is just your friend and then your more recent ex shows up with his new girlfriend but your two exs are friends so they are all hangin out?? uh i got myself in that position and it was fuckin uncomfortble... the "girlfriend" really doesnt like me because her boyfriend well has a histiry with me... and the funny part is... they use to date and then i took him away from her and then after awhile i broke it up with him and now hes back to her.. shes afraid i might take him away again.. but why the Fuck would i do that.... it isnt worth the drama... haha.. single life is great anyways... im just lookin for a guy that will commit and knowing that ill be goin to college in a year.. no point in committing when distance will tear you apart... some can get through it but i dont think i can.. i mean a little distance is ok.. an hour or two hour drive.. thats ok.. but a plane ride.. thats way to much!!! well i have nothing more to point out ot talk about! inspiration will hit me maybe tonight and ill come write!
