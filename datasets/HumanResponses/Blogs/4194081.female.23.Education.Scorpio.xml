      30 minutes of elliptical, full crunches, outer thigh, inner thigh, butt, lateral, chest press, shoulder press, and lower back.  Whew!

      Today I began my day by spilling coffee all over everything.  I'm desperate to move to California.  I hate it here.  Most of the time it's sort of a feeling of displacement, like this is NOT my culture, but on days like today I'd give anything to leave.  My home has become a haven of sorts.  People here are rude, brash, and generally not in control of their emotions--or perhaps that's just the people I've had the privilege to know.  I get nitpicked and nailed for little things.  And what's my recourse?  Nothing.  Just take it.

      My article is being published in the EEWC newsletter!!!  Can you believe it? I'm just beside myself with glee.  Wheeeee!!!!  My name, in print, on paper, and I'm not paying a professor to read it.  Oh, joy, oh loveliness, on Dasher, on Dancer... The EEWC's website is  urlLink www.eewc.com .  After the newsletter is published my article will also be available online.  Please read it (oh loyal blogreaders, cough cough, all one of you...) Oh, it gets better!  The note from the editor (who is immensely famous) to me indicated that SHE had spoken with Colleen Fulmer (also famous) and they're both pleased as punch about my writing and my voice.  I can hardly believe it.  I feel like I just got a truckload of birthday presents with shiny paper and springy bows, complete with sparklers for everyone at the party.  I'm so excited that I have to pee.  Or perhaps that's the coffee talking.  Either way, I gotta go. Okay, back.  On to some other observations... Life in Boston sure is dreary.  I keep hoping for some feeling of, "This is where I am SUPPOSED to be," but it never happens.  Just this morning I was reminiscing about driving in the fields of Kansas (my home), listening to music about God and singing with all my heart.  Every moment had meaning, every action had significance.  Here, life is brash and loud and people are snide.  I have not encountered any inherent respect for a person, much less caring.  It feels as though when people see me, they see the shell with red hair and a nose with a dent.  I would rather be seen for my heart and my passion.  I used to have a fierce, decisive sense of joy.  Where did it go?  Maybe it was buried under the snow.  Or the rain.  It has taught me one thing:  I am too young to be this cynical.  We all are.  Cynicism doesn't lead to a higher understanding, a clearer sense of the world.  It leads to unhappiness and misery.  No one should be culturally pressured into depression--which is what Boston does.  Ah, I'd better stop and get back to work.

      I bought a new bike last night. It's a Huffy Women's Comfort bike. This is what it looks like:  urlLink http://blt.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/p1119167reg.jpg  It's VERY comfortable, which is important on our ridiculously-potholed Cambridge roads. The seat, even the seat, has its own set of shocks. Can you believe it? For the first time, I rode to work at ease. My shoulders didn't feel all jolty, my tush was cushy, and I didn't bounce all over the place. It has six gears (as opposed to my old bike, which has three), so my legs didn't get as tired. I need to pump the tires up a bit but that's not much. I am pleased with my purchase. I should be able to sell my old bike for nearly the cost of the new bike--I bet I'll lose no more than twenty dollars. I'm really enjoying having this new blog. It feels like a new start, a fresh diary with a sparkly pen. Except, of course, for the fact that my hand doesn't cramp up. My friend Annie was in town last night. We were buddies from Vandy days. She was on a road trip, and I'm so pleased that she was here. It felt really awkward in a way, at first, because we have such different lifestyles now. I'm engaged, living with my fiance, and we have a dog. We've been spending our free time renovating our apartment and finding creative ways to save money. She's single, roadtripping, and lives in a house that the church has loaned her. We're all theology people, though, so we quickly slipped back into things. It was nice. I'm about to hop onto the Winnower site for some more browing...I love that message board.

      I'm going to jot down some impressions I have had thus far from my wedding shopping bonanza. First, I have been blown away at how many military brides there are!!! These girls, they're maybe 18 or 19, are getting married to men who are currently in another country! Actually a lot of them aren't engaged yet--they were just shopping for gowns for "when he finally proposes." Aaaahhh!!!! I wanted to tell them, "Girls, you have your whole lives ahead of you! Don't bank it all on one person whom you hardly know yet..." But it's such an industry. Brides are treated like the most special women in all the world. We get fussed over and primped like we're Miss America, and we're honestly not. We're women choosing to make a lifelong commitment to another person. But in this industry, weddings aren't committment places. They're Prom-for-Two with a Big Audience. Second, a lot of the wedding industry people are shocked when I tell them I need to check this or that with my fiance. Why??? Seems to me that he SHOULD care, and he does, so I certainly am not going to make a decision without him. A few of the people were offended by it, saying that they just couldn't fathom my fiance's caring because THEIR fiances didn't care...what's with the competition? We're in different relationships. Third, everyone seems to want to have a say in things, but not overtly. No one says, "This is what I want," they just suggest things and then get upset when I say I don't like it. Or, when Andy and I have agreed that this other thing is what we want, they feel like it's just my decision and I'm just trying to be difficult. Argh. Guess that's all the venting for now...

      Well, it's my first post, so I suppose I should say something monumental. Nothing comes to mind. I'm sitting at my desk eating almonds and worrying about the fact that I accidentally put on the pair of pants that I split on Friday. I had left them with the to-be-ironed so that I would remember to stitch them up. I remembered this sad fact as I was halfway to work on my bicycle. Thankfully, when I arrived at work and reached my arm back to check, my rear had not, in fact, fallen out of my pants. I think I am safe for now. I spend a lot of time trying to make the political personal rather than the personal political. There seems to be a dichotomy of factors in my life: my feminist theology, my friends' dieting, my attempts to enjoy the gym, planning an enormous, traditional wedding, my newfound love for the EEWC, my writing, summer school, my dog...it's a lot. I wish I could synthesize it into a more organized mindset but it's not going to happen. So I'm blogging. I think I'll use this time to surf around on my new blog and see what the features are.
