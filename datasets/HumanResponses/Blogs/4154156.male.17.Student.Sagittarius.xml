      This is one of the often overlooked articels of Blessed Father Seraphim of Platina, but in my opinion it is one of his most important:  urlLink Introduction to  Blessed Paisius Velichkovsky: the Man Behind the Philokalia      Today the situation of Orthodoxy is rather different, and much worse, than it was in the time of the Elder Paisius. In place of the veneer of paganism and Latinism which never actually touched the heart of Orthodoxy, we have today a prevailing atmosphere of modernist heterodoxy and senseless "keeping up with the times" which has pierced the very heart of some Orthodox Churches so deeply that they will doubtless never recover, and their children are deprived of Orthodoxy without even knowing what they have lost. In place of the heavy hand of governmental bureaucracy, we see the far heavier hand of pseudo-Christian and pagan ways of life which are depriving Orthodox Christians of something which was almost untouched in the time of Blessed Paisius: Orthodox piety, the whole Christian way of life. And, to make this whole difficult situation virtually impossible, we are beset with self-styled reformers and revivers who neither know nor feel nor love what Orthodoxy is and would "restore" the faithful to the latest fashion of Protestant scholarship or piety.  >>  This is a very real issue that is  devastating  Orthodoxy in various places. This goes along with other main themes of Father Seraphim that there is more to Orthodoxy than just professing the right faith and doing everything correctly. One has to be connected to the holy fathers through living links and within the ethos of Orthodoxy to truly be Orthodox. The sad reality is that when the spiritual aspect of Orthodoxy declines those groups slowly begin to sever themselves from the Church. What does the future hold in store for today's ecumenist Orthodox?   Do you hear, O Orthodox Christians of these last times? These writings of the Holy Fathers, even those dealing with the highest form of spiritual life, have been preserved   for us  , so     that even when it might seem that there are no God-bearing elders left at all, we may still have the unerring words of the Holy Fathers to guide us in leading a God-pleasing and zealous life. Therefore, they are wrong who teach that, because the end of the world is at hand, we must sit still, make no great efforts, simply preserve the doctrine that has been handed down to us, and hand it back, like the buried talent of the worthless servant (Matt. 25:24-30), to our Lord at His Coming! Blessed Paisius teaches that "solely by Orthodoxy of faith, without the diligent keeping of all Christ's commandments [i.e., putting Orthodoxy into   practice,   with great effort],   it is not at all possible to be saved  ."     The time of the end, though it seems to be near, we do not know; however close, it is still future, and in the present we have only the same age-old fight against the unseen powers, against the world, and against our own passions, upon the outcome of which our eternal fate will be decided. Let us then struggle while it is still day, with the time and the weapons which our All-merciful God has given us !>>  As bleak as the situation facing Orthodoxy today is though, for those  serious  about the faith and those who have the same sense of  urgency  as Father Seraphim the Holy Fathers are our guides. Of course such a life according to the fathers grows increasingly difficult, but a paradox is opened in that as the apostacy grows and spreads some of the greatest saints will be born. The  Gerondikon  says that the last generation of monks will be far greater than the first, despite a general decline from second generation until right before the last generation.   1.   There are no more elders like Paisius today.   If we imagine there    are, we can do irreparable harm to our souls—"imagination" being    precisely one of the forms of   prelest   or spiritual deception. We must learn to read of his life and deeds without being able to apply them entirely to our corrupt and degraded life. At the same time, we must have respect for our spiritual fathers and elders, who at least know more than we and try their best to guide their spiritual children under almost impossible conditions. Many young people today are seeking   gurus   and are ready to enslave themselves to any likely candidate; but woe to those who take advantage of this climate of the times to proclaim themselves "God-bearing Elders" in the ancient tradition—they only deceive themselves and others. Any Orthodox spiritual father will frankly tell his children that the minimum of eldership that remains today is very different from what Blessed Paisius or the Optina Elders represent. >>  I think Father Seraphim employs some hyperbole here as the dangers of a personality cult are so grave. The tradition of eldership remains even in recent times in such greats as Elder Iakovos of euboia, Elder Porphyrios, Elder Philotheos, Elder Cleopa of Romania and others... (even many  living  Athonite Elders). But the Church has seen numerous schisms in recent times led by a personality that has the markings of a cult leader opposed to an Orthodox Elder. Also there is a very real danger is false clericalism where many parish priests set themselves up as if they were elders to whom is due absolute obedience. Of course profound respect is due to Orthdox clergy, but never a surrender of reason that could lead one right out of the church.  Thus Orthodoxy is in a state of fierce struggle against the demonic forces of secularization and ecumenism, but through struggle and immersion in the holy fathers there if hope.

      The intention of this blog is to serve as a medium for spreading traditionalist Orthodoxy and information pertaining to Orthodoxy.  Because of this purpose I have decided to dedicate it to Saint Kosmas of Aitolia.  Articles and my opinions on them are soon to follow!
