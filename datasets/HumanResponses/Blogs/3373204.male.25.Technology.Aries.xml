      When I went to do a little digging into the root causes of jealousy as a phenomenon that occurs in more humans (and within ourselves) more times than we care to admit, I was surprised to find the word ‘love’ absent from any arguments and theories attempting to explain the emotion. I use the word ‘emotion’ loosely here, because the act or feeling of jealousy is really a complex combination of many elemental emotions- primarily fear, anger, loss, the need to be validated, the need for attention, and so on.   There are so many theories as to the roots of the matter, and all valid in their own rights, that it’s hard to focus on just one or two. However, in this post, I have decided to stay within my own experiences, and elaborate on two theories- historical and developmental.   The first talks about how insecurity within a relationship is, to a certain extent, built into our psyche from the get-go. From a female point of view, since males can procreate with any number of partners, and at a much higher rate simply by inseminating multiple females, while women can procreate only a certain amount of times, and with only one partner at a time, they have much more invested in their offspring. Hence, they are keener on keeping track on whither and when their chosen partners stray, and have an active interest in keeping that straying to a minimum.   In the case of the male of the species, since they can not procreate on their own, rely on the females to do so on their behalf, the threat of the genetic bond between a father and his offspring is by definition, doubtful because of the female’s ability to have extra-dyadic relationships. Neither gender is so strongly bonded to the other without the volatile concept of ‘love’, that there is no possibility of doubt in the relationship.  Another train of thought explores how infants, particularly those with a high level of imagination and hyperactivity are prone to disregarding the possibility that their caretakers have a life outside of the relationship shared between them. The children that, as they mature, realize that their guardians have relationships, interests and activities in their lives that are completely removed from their wards, usually tend to be less insecure through adolescence and adulthood. However, those that can’t accept that fact, tend to surround themselves in these fantasies wherein the child is singularly important to the caretaker, and most often, in cases where the caretaker tolerates these fantasies, as the child matures, these fantasies not only grow in intensity, but they are also transferred to others in his/her range of vision. Here, the child goes to the extreme of attempting to destroy the connections and thoughts of the caretaker that do not pertain to the child and its interests.   The extreme of this phenomenon leads to the child (and the adult) becoming unable to make the distinction between attacking the ideas of those it cares about having outside relationships and interests, and attacking the subject of its jealousy.   Another reaction that the subject has when affected in this manner is the development of a strong vigilance in monitoring their partner’s behaviour, their actions and interactions. Stemming from their own feelings of inadequacy, fear of rejection and abandonment, they tend to take a more than healthy interest in the comings and goings of their partners, believing that the partner should be responsible to them in all respects of their existence. No action should be taken that is perceived as unnecessary or ‘wrong’ in their eyes of the subject. This is especially important when it comes to outside relationships between the partner and those of the opposite sex. The subject translates all their feelings into the conviction that the partner (or the friends) are sexually attracted (to their partner), and are actively making advances on them in their (the subject’s) absence.   In my own experience, the second theory holds true. In a fit of bad judgment, I spent a fairly large portion of time pandering to what I knew were unhealthy and unreasonable requests by this person I was involved with, and ended up losing a lot more than I had gained from the relationship. Receiving neither comfort nor support through that period of my life, I found myself constantly having to explain my actions to this man, having to give up on external relationships that meant a lot to me, and at the same time, watching as every request granted turn into another, more unreasonable one. The tendency toward violence was present also, and though never brought to fruition, was a definite threat, and ultimately what ended the relationship.   Upon discussion with a psychologist (namely, my mother) I found that this problem of insecurity was caused in a large part by his feelings of inadequacy, that he felt that he was unable to be loved, appreciated or admired. He would go out of his way to point out his fallacies, and then demand to know whether I still loved him. Eventually, I realized I didn’t. Entirely too much of his own life and how he looked at himself was dependent on how much I was willing to give up for him, it almost got to a point where if I wasn’t willing to give in, then the relationship wasn’t working, or there was something wrong with me, which lead to the conclusion that I must be cheating on him somehow.   What is possibly the most discouraging fact is that these issues are most often so deeply indoctrinated within a person’s psyche, that it is virtually impossible to conquer them. Most people live their entire lives in this manner, and their partners (especially those that don’t have this problem) have a hell of a time dealing with it. The same fights will happen, and more so in a long term relationship, the more secure of the duo will end up sacrificing relationships and external interests in order to keep the peace.  The more insecure of the pair, possibly due to these problems, tends to be the more aggressive of the two, and the cycle continues- where at first it was the caretaker pandering to the child’s fantasies, now it is the partner. The problem is that, especially in Indian households, where the woman is still to be the submissive of the two, an insecure male dominates her life, and since she is expected to acquiesce, her life becomes meaningless outside of serving him and his needs. There is no way to break this cycle however, without extensive counseling, and frankly, I’m yet to encounter someone taking themselves to a shrink to get over being jealous, at least of their own accord.   As for me, I’m just beyond relieved that I’m not in one of those situations any more, and as wonderful and philanthropic the idea of 'saving' or 'helping' someone is, I ain't got the patience.

      There is a school of thought that claims that human beings are separated from animals by our ability to control instinct, for without self-control we're just smarter monkeys. This of course, is bullshit. Instinct cannot be controlled by definition. That is not to say that trained thought and concentration cannot take remedial action, but rather that we will do what instinct forces us to before our brain can control it. How many times has somebody thrust their hand up close to your face to make you blink? Even if you know that its coming you can't stop your reaction. It can be pretty annoying.   A lot of emotion has to do with instinct. Noone teaches you how to feel sad or happy, its built in. In our capitalistic modern world we place heavy stress on individuality, creativity and emotion. We even aggrandize emotion and say that it is the root of our humanity. The difference between us and animals.   The contradiction is obvious, if you're willing to believe that all emotion is based on instinct, but perhaps there is room for a hybrid of these two viewpoints.   Of all the emotions we have, and it is a fairly extensive repertoire, I'd have to say jealousy is one of the least controllable of all. It is intertwined with desire, another fairly strong emotion which makes it even more potent. Intelligent people turn into blithering idiots, people that have it all "together" become barely recognizable contortions of themselves. I think its fair to say  everyone  feels jealousy at some point or the other, the thing that differs is how they handle it. How much control their will can exert over it.   In my personal experience I can control it almost everytime. I feel it but don't mention it and don't take action upon it. Alas not everyone has my iron mental grip on their emotions. I've been on the receiving end of jealousy more times than I can count and it has not been pretty. That's not to say I didn't like it.  While it is a destructive force in a relationship there is a kind of solace in it. At least the other person cares enough to get jealous in the first place, right? I know a lot of women that use jealousy as a kind of "love yardstick". The more jealous a man gets, the more he loves you. Of course, they bitch and moan about it but the bottom-line is that you need jealousy. Jealousy is like this ultimate form of flattery: it means this person desires you in the basest, the rawest of all human emotion. I would be lying if I said I didn't like to see a little jealousy in my significant other.   My lack of jealous displays has raised a few eyebrows in the past. Like some freak people point and stare at. "Your girlfriend has been talking to that guy all night! Aren't you going to say something?". It finally boiled over one day and I had to explain the fact that I did feel it, I was just good at not showing it. So now there's this new rule. I don't mention it right away but rather on the way back home. Something like: "You know when that guy gave you a big hug hello? Yeah I felt a little jealousy back there". And we're all good.   In my opinion, it is the instinctive nature of the emotion that causes this behaviour. We  need  to see jealousy to prop up our egos and give us that lovin' feeling. Its stupid, its irrational, its illogical and we love it. As long as you get some balance of control and instinct going you can use jealousy as a method of both measuring and maintaining a healthy relationship.

      My deepest apologies for being so neglectful to the baby. I've been totally overwhelmed on various fronts, including personal, professional and educational.  Most recently, I've been told, with much delight from my sadistic genius of a 'Competitive and Strategic Analysis' professor that I have to come up with an analysis technique all by my retarded little self. On Marketing Warfare, no less. What the hell do I know about developing strategic analysis techniques? Zip-a-doodle, that's what.  I have a week before I need to submit this. My middle name should be procrastination. Followed by misery. And insommnia. And caffiene. And neck-muscle spasms.

      Saw this  urlLink Interview with writer Karey KirkPatrick  on  urlLink Slashdot  who is the screenwriter for the movie. I hope he doesn't screw it up. Seems a nice enough chap and I did like Chicken Run. I have recently gained faith in the Hollywood writing/directing process because I thought The Lord of the Rings was genuinely good. As were a lot of the Superhero adaptations I've seen.   This is a completely different cup of tea though. Best of luck to him. I wouldn't want his job.

      I like the fact that they killed the President.   Why is it that the Vice President is always the asshole though? Is it impossible for a movie to depict the President as being an asshole? I mean we know they are assholes, the present one being the case in point. At least the President in the movie seemed to be an idiot. Very realistic on that score.   Dennis Quaid is an idiot too. Believable as a rugged arctic adventurer, harder to believe as a real human being.  I just hate the way he acts. I think he is a boring person in real life.   Other than that, I thought the movie was great. It's always nice to see stuff blow up. The scene in LA with multiple twisters was awesome. That and the waves of the sea frozen so it looks almost like a desert. Isn't there some saying about the desert being the sea of the land... Or something equally paradoxical? Donnie Darko is in it which was weird but added to the endearment factor. What the hell is his real name anyway?  urlLink Jake Gyllenhaal  is Donnie Darko, IMDB owns your ass.  Well worth my Rs. 150. I might even pick up the DVD.

      Been messing about with ASP.Net and was having trouble getting CustomValidators to work correctly. I wanted Server Side validation for a Username (check to make sure that the username does not exist). I got it to the point where it comes back if an error occurs without writing to the database but it didn't display the error. Found this page:  urlLink 4 Guys from Rolla  that provided an easy server side only example. Still didn't fix why my message wasn't being displayed though. I think it has something to do with setting the controls to validate at design time in the design window. I am currently setting those properties at runtime through a function. Lets see how it goes when I switch that.

      I just got done reading this article:  urlLink Eurogamer.net - Microsoft set to offer XNA technology to consumer electronics rivals . This is the right way to go about it. If you're making games today the hardest choice is having to pick a platform or pay out the waazoo for a piece of the other hardware manufacturer's pie. XNA might just be a the best way to go about it. I'd love to have a competing open source standard (As OpenGL is to DirectX) but I think it takes somebody with the muscle to put out it's own console that will be able to drive adoption. If the Phantom guys at  urlLink Infinim  want to survive they'd be jumping on this bandwagon as soon as they find the trail.   I was concerned with the reference to movies and about how it is the "perfect analogy". Firstly both movies and music are far less complicated technologically when compared to games. There is a "right way" to see a movie. It scales down to a smaller screen, the sound drops from Dolby Digital whatever to mono as required but as long as you're capable of churning out upwards of 30 fps you can play a movie. There is also a "right way" to play a game. It needs to be played on the platform it was designed for. You can't expect a game written for a PC to work on a handheld. That means theres a hell of a lot more work involved in making games as flexible as movies. That little handheld can't possibly have enough juice to play your game as well as a PC could. You'd end up making an entirely new game, oftentimes sans 3D for that mobile platform. How is that the same as movies? The PSP will play your movie, the iPod will play your MP3. I think it's an oversimplification to believe that the game will work perfectly on so many platforms just because it uses XNA. Games are not as simple as movies. At best it is an analogy that falls apart at the end. XNA has the right idea, but it's going to take something special from Microsoft.

      I'm new to the blogosphere. I knew it existed, frequented a few blogs here and there and never thought about setting up my own. Which is rather weird, now that I think about it, since I'm all for trying out new stuff. Anyway, the reason I finally got involved was because I read a blog with a beautiful design, actually it was this very template.   As a web developer by profession I was naturally attracted to the simplicity of a page that lost none of it's beauty because it didn't have aqua buttons or flash or javascript trickery. I had no idea what I was getting into when I right clicked to view source. It was nothing short of a revelation.   Nestled comfortably in this elegantly coded html file was nothing whatsoever. That is to say there wasn't the stuff I expected to see. Instead of the nested tables and IE/Netscape hacks with indentation from hell I saw no content formatting code at all. The content was there in simple &lt;div&gt;s and &lt;p&gt;s but that was all.   They had managed the holy grail of web design: Separation of content from formatting. CSS is finally living up to it's promise.  Now I'm not an idiot. I know what CSS can do, hell I use CSS on every site I make. I just didn't know how far people had managed to get it to go. There were always compatibility issues, unsupported properties and a plethora of other problems that had no solution.   Things have moved on since the last time I looked. I've been gobbling up information on the new way of doing things.  urlLink A list apart ,  urlLink CSS Zen Garden  and  urlLink Douglas Bowman's Stopdesign  (he's the guy that made the template I'm using and redesigned Blogger) have all been incredibly useful resources. Needless to say I'm moving  urlLink ActivElement 's site to this kind of separation and all new projects will use this method alone. To hell with Netscape 4.  Job #1 is to redo  urlLink my home page  with pure CSS. It should then be relatively simple to get this blog to match.

      There are those that have so little faith in the American judicial system that they think SCO actually has a case. I beg to differ. This is a company that have been duped by their lawyers into believing they can win this thing.    urlLink Groklaw  has a write up on Judge Kimball kicking the case out and giving SCO 30 days to make good. The odds of SCO making good are slim at best.   It is almost comical to see SCO play the bad guy trying to get money from people giving software away. Linux is obviously the good guy, grassroots movement, everything for free, tree-hugging hippie of the software world. As with any good hollywood movie, the bad guy gets what's coming to him and the good guy gets the girl... which in this case is probably more market share.   This entire fiasco can only make Linux stronger. It's like a huge PR exercise to prove to people that the Linux code is not only utterly free (because the copyright holders have chosen to release it under the GPL), but that it is so good that SCO, the makers of UNIX, think it has to be a rip-off of their operating system. I can think of no higher praise.  SCO are done for. To all you SCO stock holders, a word of advice: Eat the loss and sell now. It will only get worse.

      As usual, Robert Cringely manages to blow away everyone by seeing something where others don't. The man is remarkably perceptive and, perhaps more importantly, is capable of delivering his message to enough people thanks to PBS and his geeky fame.  urlLink Engines of Change  is just another great piece of thinking. Everyone knows the technology exists, he just plugs enough of it together to make something completely different happen.

      I cleaned the case of my iPod today and was surprised to find that the case had popped out on the side. Now I've dropped it a couple of times by accident but I hadn't noticed the bulge on the side of the metal case. I proceeded to frantically press and pry to get it back in place, but alas, to no avail.   Obviously the next step was to Google for it. No results seemed to match the problem I had. Finally I searched for how to open an iPod thinking that would at least give me a tip as to how to get between the plastic top case and the bottom metal one. Lo and behold this turned up results.   The recommendation was to use thin plastic used in Radio Shack packaging. With no Radio Shack within a 1000 miles of Pune I started hunting around my room for a suitable piece of plastic. I now have the case popped back into place... and the implement used? A rigid strip of cold medication (Cold-Act to be presise).   So now you know. And knowing is half the battle. G.I.
