						   I just thought I'd take a moment to remark on how beautful the weather here in Boston is today.  Considering how infrequent nice weather is(especially on my days off) I decided to spend some quality time at Arnold Arboretum.  I'm writing this next to my favorite tree, the Dawn Redwood from Nanking China.  If you haven't been to the arboretum I highly recomend you go.  It's a wonderful respite from city life.  Opportunity for creativity #2:  Make something about nature to get more in touch with the world around you(or at least take a moment to look around you and a deep breath of fresh air, if you can get it).  You'll be glad you did.

						     I have noticed an annoying trend lately in women's clothing sizing.  This new trend I will politely call "the nude trend".  Low rise, super low rise...this look works on maybe 5% of the population, and even if it looks good on someone they generally can be seen spending an unflattering portion of time pulling up said clothing up to keep from exposing their goodies.  Anyhow, I've been on the lookout for casual summer dresses for a while, but no luck.  All the ones I've found are for petite women, smaller busted women, whores, or small busted whores.  It's not like I wear an unusual size either.  Mostly I wear size 10, sometimes 8, and I'm about 5 foot 7.   Here's where a creative person can take matters into their own hands...  Opportunity for creativity #1:  If you can't find a product you are searching for, make it yourself.  That first dress you try sewing may end up looking more like a slipcover, but its the attempt that counts; your hands and mind will learn in time.... you just might surprise yourself and find skill you never knew you had.

						     I must say, I really like the idea of being able to write pretty much whatever I want here and have perfect strangers be able to read it(hooray for that wacky new-fangled technology).  I thought this might be an interesting forum to express my ever increasing concern about the state of the world. The question is: Is there a place in this world anymore for a creative soul who is completely infatuated with this thing we call life?     I hope so.     I consider myself a lover of wonders(especially simple ones), and I hope there are many more like me, because without us, the world can be a pretty dismal place. But, how does one make a difference for the better in this  complicated world?  I attempt to use my creative skills to connect with other people.  I figure that if something I build makes a positive connection with another person, then I have made a difference(even if it is a small one). You know, when it comes down to it, I think a lot of people ignore the tiny voice in their mind which screams, "create, build, make beautiful things; it's important".  I would like to inspire people to take the leap and listen...

						     I've always found train stations exciting.  Everyone is always bustling around trying to get somewhere or another.  There is a really nice and simple sculpture here of stacked train couplers; they're much bigger than I thought they were.  Makes me want to create some public art.

						     The decision has been made, the cards have been dealt, and tomorrow is the day.  If I have to chain myself to my work table I'm going to make something tomorrow.  No excuses.  I know just where to begin too.  Thanks to someone very near and dear to me I have, in my posession, a large bag of small foam cubes (if I said a thank you a thousand times it would not be enough).  These cubes are glorious and I am tempted to toss them on my bed and roll around in them, but I won't....probably :-)......   Anyhow..tomorrow...no excuses, I get to the work of making..and so it begins.

						     The smallest things can make me so happy.  I was in the grocery store yesterday, and of course I had to take a wander through the toy aisle.  I found these fantastic sand molds in the shape of small hand and foot prints.  I know what I'm going to be doing when I finally get myself to the beach.  I'm picturing hundreds of sand hand and footprints in cascading patterns..oh boy!....I can scarcely contain myself.  Sometimes I'm just like a little kid at Christmas.....

						     I know that I'm on the brink of a creative outpouring, yet I am paused at the split-second before the floodgates open.  It is a mix of fear and hope and longing that keep me static.  There is only one thing left to do and that is find the last grain to tip the scales; to move forward in the exhilaration of making.  What that grain will be I do not know as of yet, but it will be sudden, and it will be soon.  I can feel it in the depths of my bones.

						     I'm walking in the city this morning and just passed the BPL.  Even though I have some complaints about living here, it is sentiment like the above(which is carved into the stone structure of the BPL) that makes me happy to live in this city and in this nation.  It is easy to forget the tremendous opportunities available to us as free people.  I make it a point to remind myself as often as possible just how fortunate I am in comparison to the majority of other people around the world (even though I still make jokes about being a poor artist, I realize that this is only in relation to the standard of living here).   We are and come from people who chose to risk everything for freedom, for eqality, to live life on their own terms.  I am proud of this heritage.  We are the land of the free and the home of the brave and I, for one, hope we always remain so.

						     I just played this board game called "Cranium".  The rules are a little convoluted at the start, but all and all I had a fun time.  There are four decks of cards; each with its own type of question or challenge.  There's a deck whick is similar to pictionary, but with a few twists.  Some of the cards require you to mold a word, object, or action out of clay.  Others propose you draw with your eyes closed.   There was one deck which became the dreaded one.  This one was all about performing, often rather like charades, although sometimes you are allowed to speak.  I ended up enjoying this deck though (when else would I get to pretend I'm Ronald Reagan?)     My one difficulty was trying to keep myself from playing with the clay.  I used it to make a chubby brontosaurus with earmuffs and a scarf(who knows why that particular form came to me).  Then the clay had to be used in the game, so I saved the head and gave the other team the bulk of the clay(poor chubby dino).   I have always loved board games & have played a good number of them in my day. This one is a good party game.  It requires all sorts of different specialized skills from artistic prowess to spelling.

						     I was walking in the city yesterday and came to an intersection, and being Boston (meaning who knows what traffic laws cars and pedestrians will choose to go by today) I stopped to check for oncoming traffic.  No sooner did I stop when this woman plows into my back with a "Oh, I'm Sorry".  Which I would have been completely fine with, as I'm a reasonable person.  Here's what makes me mad though, she then proceeds to say "We Had a WALK sign!" and trots away in her oh-so-fashionable cowprint high heels.  I can't stand it when people have the need to blame me for their own carelessness.  I wanted to scream after her, "we live in a society!"  Are poeple so freaked out about accidental contact with another person in this city that they can't simply be a reasonable person? Sigh...

						     This weekend I accquired lots of stuff to make things with.  Some items were acquired at "Family Dollar"(one of those anything here's a buck stores) and some were given to me by someone very near and dear.  Now comes the fun part.  I get to figure out what I'm going to make from 360 fake fingernails, 600 tiny, fuzzy ponytail elastics, all those foam cubes I mentioned before etc..

						     I went out rollerblading (actually attempting to rollerblade since I'm still learning) and  had a great time.  I'm getting much better at it.  Today's lessons included learning more speed control and turning(both left & right :-), can you tell I'm rather proud of myself?)  My safety gear came in handy.  I lost my balance a couple of times, and let me tell you, it's so much nicer to fall on a kneepad than your kneecap.   I think I'm going to enjoy this thing they call rollerblading :-)

						     It's hard to believe that I have not mentioned my personal creative hero yet ....(drum roll please) Jim Henson. Not only did the man have an extremely active and successful creative life, he was also the kind of guy you'd want as your friend; a truly good person.   I thought I'd relay a bit of his writing from 1986 (I'm quoting this from a book called "Jim Henson: The Works") which I strongly connect with.  "Over the years, I've evolved my own set of beliefs and attitudes-as we all have-that I feel works for me.  I don't feel particularly comfortable telling other people how to think or live.  There are people who know much more about these things than I do, but here goes...   I believe that life is basically a process of growth-that we go through many lives, choosing those situations and problems that we will learn through.  I believe that we form our own lives, that we create our own reality, and that everything works out for the best.  I know I drive some people crazy with what seems to be ridiculous optimism, but it has always worked out for me.   I believe in taking a positive attitude toward the world, toward people, and toward my work.  I think I'm here for a purpose.  I think it's likely we all are, but I'm only sure about myself.  I try to tune myself in to whatever it is that I'm supposed to be, and I try to think of myself as a part of all of us-all mankind and all life.  I find it's not easy to keep these lofty thoughts in mind as the day goes by, but it certainly helps me out a great deal to start out this way.  I love my work, and because I enjoy it, it doesn't really feel like work.  Thus I spend most of my time working.  I like working collaboratively with people.  At its best, the film and television world functions creatively this way.  I have a terrific group of people who work with me, and I think of the work that we do as "our" work.   I don't know exactly where ideas come from, but when I'm working well ideas just appear.  I've heard other people say similar things- so it's one of the ways I know there's help and guidance out there.  It's just a matter of our figuring out how to receive the ideas or imformation that's there waiting to be heard.   I find it's very important for me to stop every now and then and get recharged and reinspired.  The beauty of nature has been one of the great inspirations in my life.  Growing up as an artist, I've always been in awe of the incredible beauty of every last bit of design in nature.  The wonderful color schemes of nature, which always work harmoniously, are particularly dazzling to me.  I love to lie in an open field looking up at the sky.  One of my happiest moments of inspiration came to me many years ago as I lay on the grass, looking up into the leaves and branches of a big old tree in California.  I remember feeling very much a part of everything and everyone.   Working as I do with the movement of puppet creatures, I'm always struck by the feebleness of our efforts to achieve naturalistic movement.  Just looking at the incredible movement of a lizard or a bird, or even the smallest insect, can be a very humbling experience.   At some point in my life I decided, rightly or wrongly, that there are many situations in this life that I can't do much about-acts of terrorism, feelings of nationalistic prejudice, cold war, etc.-so what I should do is concentrate on the situations that my evergy can affect.   I believe that we can use television and film to be an influence for good; that we can help to shape the thoughts of children and adults in a positive way.  As it has turned out, I'm very proud of some of the work we've done, and I think we can do many more good things.   When I was young, my ambition was to be one of the people who made a difference in this world.  My hope still is to leave the world a little bit better for my having been here.   It's a wonderful life and I love it."

						     Like letting go of a long-held breath, I am working again.  I decided to start with the 360 fake fingernails; just started playing around, and it's certainly interesting so far.  Several different ideas may come from this material.  I'm also using some of the foam cubes(gotta love those foam cubes).     :-)   :-)   :-)   :-)   :-)   :-)   :-)   :-) Good times, good times.

						     I didn't feel like going to sleep last night.  It felt like my creative drive was working overtime and so many partial ideas were rattling around in my head (clunk, clunk, clunk).  If I didn't have a job to go to today, I could have easily stayed up for hours playing with materials and happily making something from nothing.  I'll have to save this energy surge for after work today (and for tomorrow because I have the day off).   I'm also keyed up because I'm planning to give rollerblading another go tomorrow.  I just bought a helmet (because my head is very important to me); I already have the other nesessary safety gear for a novice, so I'm good to go.     There are so many things that I want to learn.  I've started a list of them so I can give them a try one at a time.  I have a tendancy to get involved in lots of new things at once, so I'm hoping that keeping a list will keep me focused on one task at a time.   Another Wednesday;...bowl of cereal, trip to the gym, work, etc...can't wait to get back home tonight.

						     I spent a good deal of yesterday sewing a bridesmaid dress for my high school best friend's wedding.  I think it came out rather well considering it's the fourth dress I have ever made.     Each time I try a different pattern for sewing clothes I learn something different.  This time I learned that simplicity and accuracy are key.  The top of the dress is a little more complicated than I thought it would be, but I think I can simplify it a bit with a few sewing tucks and some careful ironing.  I have also learned to put ego aside and make the garment a bit larger than you need (I find pattern sizes vary wildly and it's always easier to take a garment in than it is to make it larger).   So now that this dress is finished (the wedding is in mid-July) I can concentrate on the work I need to make for my show in August...so little time...so much to do...an artist's work is never done...but truthfully, I enjoy every minute of it.

						     Another weekend passed far too quickly.   It is Monday, full of promise; meaning I can make progress builing objects for the show I'm going to be in later in the summer.  There is a certain excitement before an idea is fully fleshed out, when I don't know how the end result will look, that I enjoy(the allure of the unknown).   I think I am finding it difficult to work both on a deadline and with a specific theme.  I don't run from a challenge though, so I'll consider these limitations assets inspead.   Time to get to work...

						     In my kitchen sit six very ripe bananas and I need to find something to bake with them.  No matter how carefully and deliberately I try to buy bananas a few at a time, and at different stages of ripeness, I always end up with a few (or in this case a lot) of just barely useable bananas.  Good thing bananas are cheap, or I'd make me mad (I confider myself a frugal person; not cheap, frugal :-)      I am really looking forward to my day off tomorrow.  I plan to go rollerblading again, this time in public, not just practice at the elementary school tennis courts.  I'm also looking forward to a break from sewing...it seems like that's all I've been doing lately.   Well, back to the search for recipes using bananas....

						     My goal today is to stay focused on one task at a time.  I'm actually really good at being able to accomplish lots of things at once, but it leaves me frenzied and tired, and I'd actually like to enjoy my day off.     I had an interesting day yesterday.  I woke up seeing an image of a sculpture I need to make (nice when that happens).  At work, I figure to counter the terrible customer, there was a customer who I had a spiritual connection moment with (kind of a feeling that a moment in time will change you and give you deeper insight; very hard to explain, but happens to me from time to time).   I'm not going to put a lot of pressure on today...just remind myself that life can be beautiful in silence and peace at times...sounds like I need a break from the hustle and the bustle.     I'm really looking forward to July.  I actually have two weeks off...haven't had that much time off in years :-)

						     I watched the movie Galaxy Quest tonight.  I'm not really the biggest fan of Tim Allen, but he was really fun to watch in this role and came off as sympathetic.  Sometimes, especially after a long day, it's nice to see people saving the universe :-)

						     Life at work today was troubling.  In retail work, there are always days that customers are demanding or agrivating, but a customer today crossed the line into insulting.  I don't like it when it is insinuated that I'm trying to rip someone off and that the work I do is not worth the money charged for it (I work in a custom picture framing store).  I don't mind so much when people from other places such as the Middle East or Europe try to haggle with me or complain a little; it's a cultural difference that I can deal with.     All custom work is expensive.  A person wouldn't be surprised that a custom tailored suit costs more than one off the rack, but with chain stores offering cheap(and often badly crafted) framing deals, it makes people crazy-thirsty for bargains.     I may not be a high salary executive, but I deserve respect for the work I do.  I take my job seriously, and modesty aside, I'm good at it.  I have worked my entire life at creative endevours and it has given me visual insight.  I respect the objects people bring to me and try to help them presere and display them in a way which makes them happy. Sigh.... I'll get down off my soapbox now.

						     I find myself at the end of another day off from work.  I spent a good part of the day sewing again.  There must be some larger meaning to all this sewing I feel an urgent need to complete (something subconscious perhaps?).  I keep meaning to work on pieces for my show, but well meaning as I am, it just doesn't seem like my priority.  I'll have to get cracking soon, as August is not so very far away, but I'm a firm believer in not forcing the creative process.   My relationship with how and why I create feels like it is in the process of changing.  I know that I am happiest when I'm just making things for no particular reason, perhaps to give away, and most especially when I'm making something for someone very near and dear to me(miss you).   While I don't know for sure how this change will manifest itself (new materials, new techniques, new ideas?) I know what would ultimately make me happy as a creative person......I'm picturing a place to work, a nice studio in a house somewhere not too noisy or crowded.  It's a place where I can paint without the worry of accidently poisoning myself with toxic fumes(like I would in my current apartment).  It has a place to put all my tools and a nice working surface (like the workbench my grandfather made my family when I was a kid), and ample natural as well as artificial light.  I'd like to have a decent sized yard with grass I could walk barefoot in, a place to garden, make paths, sculpt the land; and dare I dream; build my own bizzare stuctures out a found materials.  When it comes down to it I just want room to breathe and to make things on my own terms...that's my idea of heaven.

						     While in the midst of working with some dimensional fabric paint on graph paper, this idea from my past crept into my head and smiled at me.  Very curious indeed!  I made something my freshman year of college which relates to this concept, but I was never entirely happy with the piece; it seemed unfinished somehow.   My new take on this old idea has the added benefit of allowing me to sew wierd materials on my sewing machine (always a decided plus).  I've come to the conclusion that as an artist, my main interest is with using material and especially finding ways to use nontraditional materials in ways that make the viewer ask me "what is that".  When people are puzzled and intrigued by what I've made, I've done my job (and I'll be beaming from ear to ear).

						     My show begins in exactly one month.  In my current state of mind I'm feeling excited about it.  I think the pieces that have been started are good building blocks and that the rest will come more easily.  Sure there will be struggles along the way, but that's to be expected as part of the process.   Time to get to work.

						     I've spent some quality time the last few days actually getting work done.  I'm sucessfully past the phase of self doubt.  This can be quite the hurdle to leap over, especially if I haven't been consistently working for a while.     I like what I've come up with so far.  As usual I have made assorted bits which I figure out what to do with as I go.  I have a pretty good feeling for the direction one piece in particular is taking, which is always exciting.   I love the process of creating...even on a deadline...once I get in my groove it's a beautiful thing indeed. :-)

						     Seems like I've been doing an awful lot of preparing lately.  Firstly, and not surprisingly, for my show.  I now have four finished pieces (phew! Wipe the sweat from my brow, what an exhausting way to spend my week off!).     Secondly, I am preparing myself for my friend's wedding on Sunday.  So far I've applied polish to all ten of my nails.  Her colors include periwinkle, so that's what color they are, with glitter :-)  As soon as I finish writing this, I have to pack, and yes, hem my dress.   I decided to reward myself for my hard work this week (but not until I finished my fourth piece, as this was my goal) by trying to find some cool boots at a local discount shoe store (I'm frugal, not cheap ;-) remember)  I spent some time there, and finding nothing, proceeded to a discount clothing store.  Still nothing.  Finally I found a treasure at "Parade of Shoes" 30% off sale.  Picture white, vinyl, 3&1/2 inch heeled, knee-high go-go type boots.  AWESOME!!! And only $20 to boot (hee, hee, hee).      I'd better get packing now or I'll be exhaused for work tomorrow.

						     I went to a yoga class this morning.  It was challenging but not overly so.  The instructor was very focused and kept us moving at a good pace (slightly painful to know you are working).  Leaving the class, I felt taller which means I achieved the yoga goal of feeling a "lengthening of my spine".     We didn't get to do any of the really pretzley moves I've tried before, but this is probably good since my legs were getting tired at some points (put your knee behind your head, stand on one toe, bend your other knee, lean forward, arms to the ceiling, and oh....remember to breathe ;-)

						     I'm really happy with how my first almost finished sculpture has turned out.  Looking at it makes my mind twist this way and that, trying to make sense of it, and if I'm curious I hope other people will be also.  I enjoy other people's reactions to my work, most especially when its from someone who is not firmly entrenched in the art scene.  I like to hear the voices of people who haven't already made their minds up about what "art" is.  I'd rather someone trust their gut reaction to something I've made than to try to compare it to all art history and judge it on someone else's criteria.   Now I crack the whip...back to work.

						     So far today I have successfully wrapped a foam rectangle in jute and wire.  I also picked up some groceries, and as luck would have it, ice cream was on sale (about 60% off in fact).  I figured I could treat myself as it is a vacation week and I've been working hard (its light ice cream anyway :-)    Next week I'm going to be a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding, and have to remember to finish hemming the dress I made by Friday.  What with all the work I plan on doing for my show, I'm going to have to pin up a large note or something to make sure I remember.  I've never been in a wedding before.  I'm just the smallest bit nervous; at my core I am a shy person and I know that being part of the wedding party will require that a certain amount of attention will be paid to me.  Really, it's not that big a problem.  The fact that my friend has planned the event so carefully is what throws me off balance the most.  I'm not a person who needs events in my life to be perfect.  I've had too many unexpected things happen to expect my plans to work out exactly.  I try to roll with what life gives me.  Luckily, my friend and her husband (this is a second ceremony, the first was only for immediate family) are very nice people, and I may be reading the schedule thing all wrong.  I'm not going to worry about it, after all I can only be me and do my best to help them celebrate something important.   For now, I have to get back to work.  I'd like to have my first piece finished today (keep your fingers crossed for me)...

						     Today has a great feeling about it.  I'm energetic and ready to face the day's challenges.  Last night I added some bits to the sixth piece for my show.  All six pieces are essentially done, though I do tend to tinker a bit before I truly call something "finished".  I put finished in quotes because I have a tendancy of taking older pieces apart and using them to make new pieces, so there's question as to if they are ever truly finished.   Okay, deep cleansing breath ;-)...time to go too work.

						     It's turned into one of those days when I just can't seem to get any work done.  I think it's because I just want to be finished with this body of work.  As much as I like building and being active creatively it still comes down to the deadline, which is death for my creative drive.  But, enough complaining, I'm going to take a break and go for a long walk to clear my head.  This usually helps a lot.

						     I decided not to go for the walk yet.  Sometimes I just need to ride through the tough spots by working even though I'm frustrated.  I'm done with five pieces, the sixth is in the process of being spray painted, and the seventh might acually merge with the fifth depending on how I'm feeling.  Six is my goal and I'm glad to be almost there.

						     I had a good time hanging most of my pieces today.  I'm going to put some finishing touches on my last piece tonight so I'll be able to put that one up tomorrow.  :-)   Just having the work out of my studio gives me such a feeling of freedom.

						     I plan on hanging some of my pieces for the show tomorrow.   At this point I always feel a bit aprehensive.  How will the show come together?  Will all the pieces meld and seem cohesive?  How will my audience react?  Displaying newly created artwork can feel like standing naked and vulnerable in public....well maybe not quite that exteme, but close :-)   I look forward to seeing how everything looks in the space and how my co-workers pieces relate to my own.  The dual sided nature of art making; doubt and exhilaration, will be at their peak tomorrow...

						     I have worked very hard getting sculpures made and preparing for my show, and you know what?  I'm tired of the whole thing (at least the deadline deal :-)   ) Even though I have a bit of work left on my final piece, I decided to take the day mostly for myself (had a Doctor's apointment in the middle of it though - clean bill of health :-D)  Curently I am watching a movie (The Joy Luck Club) after having watched some of the TV mini-series/movie Merlin (gifed to me by someone very near and dear).  But, of course I'm not just sitting here watching.  I often feel the need to occupy my hands so I'm crocheting a blanket.  It feels really great to be making something solely for fun and for me to keep for my very own.
