       PERFECT   Guys that I like  they make me twitch inside  it's always something about their smile or how they look at me or simply the way they dance across the room  to greet me  Guys that I have huge crush on they tend to  try ending my life by choking me  so that no words  can escape from my mouth by making my heart goes flying on a roller coaster jet or by taking  my breath away for no reason at all  And trouble only comes when I meet a guy like you  who fits perfectly into both categories  Depok, January 3, 2002 02:22 I always feel sad when I think of you these days   BI   I would never go bi because girls don't turn me on   But I know a guy who could   And the fact that he's a friend doesn't make me get it  Why would you want to be with someone who has everything that you have who feels the way you feel who thinks probably just like you who walks and talks like you and at the same time still like the opposite  They say the number is increasing  but I still don't get it  Depok, January 3, 2002 02:50   TECHNOLOGY   During the whole course  of trying to find anything that’s worthwhile I discovered  that whenever I’m in  for something huge always, I never fail consider it a record to make everything  turn into this chaotic pandemonium at the last minute  Is it my fault  if I want to yell  at something  that doesn’t even know its helplessness  Depok, January 8, 2002 11:35   MAGNET   the attentions  that he draws  are piling up in front of his door up through eternity  and both of us, the girls are looking at him  intensely not even trying  to regain our dignity  and he keeps on smiling and looking and standing there like he's just an average guy whose work is to make girls' insides melt like butter out in the sun  the question is,  who would he rather see you  or me?  Depok, January 13, 2002 23:35 Found an uncut diamond in an unusual place called Mangga Dua   CROWDED    I saw a woman in a red dress on the train this morning on my way to the office  She looked as if she’s about to cry I couldn’t bear to hear her silent sorrow  So I looked away only to find those with their dumb sticks  They’re trying to consume my innocence only I wouldn’t let them pass my defense  Jakarta, January 26, 2002 12:11   HATE   I’m reacting  by placing music to my ears by looking the other way by putting on a mask to cover the bitterness on my lips and the disappointment in my eyes  She’s so different and maybe that is why she can be so annoying at the same time   Jakarta, March 11, 2002   THE PROSPECT OF A FUTURE WIFE   I’m not asking you to understand but surely you see that I don’t like being watched from head to toe or being weighed, determining fitness and especially being judged under older, presumably wiser  microscopic eyes of complete strangers who wait and gladly expect me  to crumble, fall, slip, break into tiny bits of dust so once again you’re safe back into the arms of the circle outside mine  Depok, May 18, 2002   UNREASONABLE MOOD SWINGS   Can I put on a sour mask  should I be smiling all the time when I do not feel like smiling at all   Do I always need to have a reason  for having a bad or not so great day  It’s not the heat It’s not something that I ate It’s not that I don’t feel good And so sorry, but it is definitely not you Baby  It’s just me and I don’t think I need any excuse or rhyme or reason to justify  that I’m human  Depok, May 20, 2002 After midnight   COLLECTIVE SOULS   I don’t care about your current love life As far as I’m concern it doesn’t exist I only want you to feel what I’m feeling because to experience this  all by myself is beyond my comprehension  Don’t tell me  you don’t know  or you don’t care about this because we’re in this together  and I know that  for a fact  May 28, 2002 on the train to Semarang   ENDURE   the midnight sky is giving a great spectacle of fireworks shower above the water while I stand alone on the dock   I don’t even know there is such thing as the confusion to spend your last morning before a creature with wings to fly you  to another time and place  should it be with someone who loves you  or someone you love  I hear footsteps coming toward me  and I don’t know who will appear before my eyes I also don’t know whether that person loves me  or that I love that person but I feel that this night  will last a lifetime   Depok, June 13, 2002 23:52   GRAVE   I saw him cried and I just froze there sitting like an idiot without offering a shoulder, a back, a handkerchief, a hug, a hand all I did was staring at him  and couldn't help feeling sorry for myself because I couldn't give any consolation in any form to a person that I once considered heartless  cold  and distant  Depok, June 29, 2002 01:01   SPELL OF RAIN   I once saw a falling star it was nearly dawn in the middle of nowhere I wasn't alone but I felt lonely I recalled that I made a wish but I don't want to remember  what I wished for  After more than four years I don't want to see just a shooting star I want shower of them illuminate the eyes filled with confused tears ease the hearts  that needed relief  I guess I got tired  of moonlit night skies  Depok, July 2, 2002 01:21   LINGER   I feed the flame inside  the stove that burns slowly painfully with imaginary conversations fake smiles happy faces insincere songs  But I forget to pour the laughing gas and I forget to blow some reality  I keep on waiting for something  I don't even know or want  that I lost some sense  of myself and my surroundings  And to find everything again is hard just like trying to grow thorns  on crushed roses so I lay upon my faith in life, once again  Depok, July 10, 2002 03:31   STANDPOINT   loving is not always physical I often fall in love  with fragile flesh wounded wisdom tainted tantrum  beauty is not always about symmetry I learn to admire a flaw  like crooked teeth extreme villains in the movies  sometimes you can learn so much  from a crash of heart often you get a gift of love from the person you hated most  because there's no such thing as  perfection exactness you can only rely on subjective views  Depok, July 18, 2002 01:45   CAST A SHADOW   would you comb my hair after I wash it with your finger, delicately disentangle it   would you rub my temples when I got a headache gently pushing the pain away and tell it to never come  back  would you kindly just smile away when I stupidly trying to change the subject after making dumb remarks  would you sigh quietly when I said bluntly that you're stubborn   would we end up together no matter what happen along the way  Depok, July 22, 2002 00:36   CLING AND CLUTTER   I hate being clumsy but I can't help it the worst part is  I get clumsy with things that  I cherish and need the most like the walkman you gave me and the heart that I gave up for you  Depok, July 23, 2002 01:01   SETTLING   I'm trying to make a point but our conversation will drag on  with pointless crap and lousy jokes that I would love to hear in another time  except right now when I attempt to settle an issue before it builds up into bigger issues before we have to sleep in the same bed for the rest of our lives and since we cannot go to sleep  until every dispute is settle I have to do it in advance  and take the blame and accusations on my shoulder and sigh them away  Depok, July 25, 2002 02:20   SANCTUARY   I've set a distance so I cannot go back sitting securely under my anonymity smiling whenever necessary  But I love some angles around the corner  that I always dreaded to go and decided to visit it  once and a while  Jakarta, September 11, 2002   ESCAPISM   I miss the scrumptious smell  of Oleum cajuputi that grow proud and lonely  on the park behind the hospital  I haven't been there for a while walking and kicking auburn leaves scattered by the wind  interrupted by rain wondering why such a lovely place  can be so quiet and peaceful  in the middle of the hectic metropolis  I surely will miss walking down that park  when the chances of escaping grow thinner  Depok, September 19, 2002 22:42   ON THE EDGE   I'm about to break into bits of tiredness that circled around  but still it cannot find a button to push to take me down  I tell myself I've been in worst situation and it could be worse but even as a believer in optimistic frame of mind I realize that there's a limit to everything  Even for a person who always gets exactly what she wants  Depok, September 28, 2002 01:04   EXPECTATIONS   I don't want to damage anything but the clearer the path  the scarier it gets  the wind beats my body from every direction imaginable the sand got caught inside my eyes causing zero visibility  I notice that the road becomes steeper with every inch I move forward but the view is getting more and more magnificent  as I haul my body up above  and I'm terrified so petrified  by the height I don't want to look down because it's useless there's nothing you can do once you're up this high no turning back  that's why I reduced my speed  when I saw the gray sky clearing  showing brilliant blue  for I fear it's just too good to be true  Depok, December 2, 2002 22:27

       DROUGHT   you're a dream which is perfect beautiful lasted for hours and bring nothing  but a lump of tears  stuck in my throat the next morning and it lingers  through the day  like the worst hang-over you're a dream vivid, but still a dream    he, on the other hand is love alive with colors and tones  and tickness which is not perfect sometimes ugly but when you deny it you'll die just like that  those are my defenses talking  when someone questions  the absence of you in my life          Depok, January 14,2003 22:33    VIVID   you've been haunting me  taunting me daring me to step out of super ego have fun, enjoy it while you can  "admit it, you want me so bad, that you practically beg me to be the star in your dreams"  I have seen you lately with your vague expression but definate passion with your arms reaching for me ready to be rescued  And I've been waking up just before dawn sweating with anxiety tired from the excitement that doesn't even exist  Depok, March 25, 2003 19:12   UNRAVEL   walking down the street with an empty stare the piercing bitterness inside the skull it's almost unbearable to experience the hurt in every inch of the skin  yet each and every muscle feels numb cannot think, cannot even hear yourself thinking your mind went completely blank  like a deserted market place  Someone named this condition a heartbreak  Depok, April 8, 2003 20:19   FALTER   their young faces could never lie but the streets always managed to make age run like a speeding bullet  shoving their noses to the windows they smile in the mornings when they want to and yell at nights when they have to  they have ends to meet deadlines to beat sympathy to win  sometimes I just want give  anything that I have in my backpack  and said, "Rest dear, it's after midnight."  Depok, April 10, 2003 22:34   WITHSTAND   seeing and hearing  my sister fights furiously with her boyfriend makes me strangely  grateful for what we have and thankful that we've passed that phase not necessarily graceful but with a slight of twisted hearts and bruised egos but hey, we're still here standing strong  Depok, June 16, 2003   WARY   why can't you just admit  for once in five years  that you're scared of the fact that I'm still a girl who has a heart who can drop everything and walks away just like that not caring whose hearts  I'll be carrying or leaving behind you're so scared that there's a hint of a feeling a hint of wanting to keep me for yourself a hint of jealousy  Depok, July 4, 2003   SCREAM   I love you  like the salty, damp air that we breathed sinking into every pore in our bodies  like the gloomy weather that hung above our heads driving us mad  like the crushing waves brainwashing our mind with its unbearable sound  like the damn cold night forcing us to cling to each other  like the feel of your calluses against my skin rough, bumpy, raw  I love you  one hundred and fifty-nine million miles an hour on a winding two-way road without brakes eyes wide shut  Depok, July 25, 2003   FIGHT   we've always been defeated all of our lives by the greater power government money muscle fame  we've strugled just to keep our heads above waters living from scattered luck and twisted fate  but we keep our dignity through out these years the money whenever there's any is not covered in blood or sweat  of other people  and I'm so thankful for having you as family  Depok, August 1, 2003 15:38   DELIRIOUS   Handling emptiness with bare touches  picking up the pieces  as the cold begins to swell filling the holes patching up the tear replacing liveliness with infinate stillness and as my vision drops  into zero the hope now lies between sleep and awake trying to find your laughter  among the tomb stones  Depok, August 21, 2003   VOID   a bottomless pit is forming in my soul  it's like something is drilling through my whole self  destroying almost everything including your smiles  the ribs are showing, I grow thin by the days still I cannot love you less  Depok, September 1, 2003 23:42   WITHHOLDING   my friend is getting married and he's not telling anybody  it's like a big secret that no one supposed to know about  it's like suggesting that love is  something that you have to hide  under the bed inside a box  well, I flip the covers  and I open the lid  he's getting married in two weeks  Depok, September 2, 2003 00:23   TIDE    the wave started  without warning  crushing me  suffocating rapidly  I couldn't swim  so I grabbed his hand and he pulled me close tightly  and my whole life flashed before my very eyes I could almost smell the fear the pungent stink of approaching death  then I heard his voice 'keep your head up stay calm keep breathing stay with me'  all of a sudden I have faith in his hands his mind and his will of making sure that we would get out of here breathing  regardless that later I found that his hands were shaking and mine were still  Bandung, September 4, 2003   SORE   my wound is still gapping with fresh blood dripping running through  wetting bodies cold with wind minds darken by sin  this void is unbearably severe  Depok, September 8, 2003 12.24   IN BETWEEN   mom can't stand my sister with her ways of money and crazy boyfriend  mom always tries to poke around with her nose and her mouth sniffing something to be brought up  now my sister just can't take it anymore she wants to move out and stays out  can I have her room?  Depok, September 14, 2003 23:36   HARM   I still can't help feeling like I'm being cheated  you said that you love me but how come I've always felt that whenever we're trying to be honest to each other to ourselves it always hurts me the most  Depok, September 20, 2003 01:47   DEVASTATING   my stomach aches the insides twirling doing back flips my head spins as I'm watching  punches kicks swear words satisfied smiles  humans or punching bags?  they all came with hope to become someone and a future that will hold them together  now they're back, home at last in body bags  I start to sob loudly in between commercials  Cicurug, September 22, 2003 01:15 After watching SCTV's special report on STPDN   GREATER THAN INFINITY   someone told me once that some things are just too much to explain too much to comprehend  like the pain of letting go the hurt of loving in vain the irony of wanting someone so badly that you cannot even touch  like running out of reasons  to look at you  to hear your voice  to feel your body brushed accidently into mine  I feel that my black hole of infinate anguish is not getting any smaller  Depok, October 4, 2003 00:56   SMOKE RING   I saw a beutiful young woman  in the dim lights of a chinese restaurant  short hair  heavy, dark emphasis on the eyes red shiny lips smoking, blowing perfect smoke rings  the guy that sat next to her was swallowed by her glow  Jakarta, October 5, 2003   FERREL   I don't remember you  your name curled in my tongue like some inaudible foreign words your touch is warm but meaningless you gaze with anticipation that I don't recognize  I don't know you  even after everybody insists that we have always been together as long as everyone can remember everyone but me  I've tried, really I tried to memorize all the silly little facts like the color of your eyes your favourite food your favourite song but it's just so hard  I tried to make you leave by being rude but instead you come forward and offered me your hands and said "Hi, I'm Mia."  Depok, October 7, 2003 23:22   FOUR YEARS AGO SHE FELL IN LOVE   she came alive when they met for the first time she comes alive whenever she talks about him she's alive because of him  radiant smiles blooming on her lips when the topic of conversation turns to him when someone mention his name  he never knew  because he didn't see her walked past him when she fell in love with him on that street leading to the railway station  Depok, October 31, 2003 21:04   STALKER   he said that a girl used to chase him around came to his school came to his home telling everyone that she's the one he had eyes on  he said that she brought colors to his life  by doing the destruction that she created  in a way, she made the person that he is now the resilient, self-assured man that I know today  I wonder, am I recreating the same horror by begging him to see me whenever I want to by giving gifts and by nagging constantly to him about my life  Is there a slight possibility that I, the one who's high on his charms, am coloring his life, even as we speak?  Depok, November 21, 2003 23:06

       QUESTION OF THE DAY   I got to ask you this question just this one silly question  I hope you don't look at me  like you always do when you think  what I say is completely stupid or doesn't make any sense or just a plain question you don't need to ask  And I swear to God, if you laugh  or even giggle or smile just a bit or faintly I'll slap your face so you can go kiss the ground  Ready?  Am I wrong if I said that the reason you've been calling me lately sometimes three times a day  is because you miss me terribly?  Because if I'm not,  then I'll miss you too  Depok, January 5, 2001 11:42 PM   quiet quarrel  my mother cannot say things that bother her  straight-facedly I cannot express my anger to her straight-facedly  so how come I still feel awfully disrespectful when I slam the door behind me  so she can hear my silent disagreements about her lonely disagreements on my beloved kittens  Depok, 2/8/01 9:47 PM                                                               Missing You   You said that you miss me I miss you too I don't know exactly what you miss  but I do know  that I miss you waking me up  at dawn with warm kisses I miss your scent in your T-shirts when we hug And I miss you snuggling close and looking handsomely sleepy  Depok, 2/10/01 9:34 PM                                                              Let's get married, shall we?    I HATE MONDAY   I never knew how hard it is to face Monday when a person can only see another person that matters the most to her on week ends until you got a full-time job  2/26/01 1:11 AM   ENCHANTED EVENING   I had a rare night last night I felt no sleepiness or a sharp longing of nothing like I use to every now and then   I saw the moon only partly covered with gray clouds through the clear-glass ceiling I spotted black figure running about before I had the chance to take a closer look at it  I sensed bitter cold against my inner lung or was it bitter loneliness? I sure was not alone but I couldn’t help wanting to cuddle and to have you  Depok, March 16, 2001   THE RIDE   I should be home by now but the ride drag itself slowly rather unwillingly I sat on the corner avoiding every pair of eyes many bits curiosity I watched the road outside through the glass window a child-like driver a man on a motorcycle cars with their blinding lights Then I saw my reflection with black lines around my eyes, dry lips, tangled hair and I realized I need to go home immediately  Depok, April 10, 2001   YOGYAKARTA   Back to where I belong still missing the atmosphere I left behind The unbearable heat that made my friends' room hotter than hell (not that any of us ever been there) and my thigh was burning as if  being smoothed by a red hot iron The cold orange juice The motorcycle ride around town and the mysterious longings I felt inside every time I visit and leave that town I never notice that longings till now  Depok, May 7, 2001                                                            SICK    You make me sick of arguing of being confronted of having you  pointing finger at me accusing me  doing something being something  You make me sick of myself doubting myself of trying to keep hoping that there's 'us' in the future by calling me constantly and we always end up  fighting for nothing  I'm too sick to consider you to take you seriously to play your silly games of running around in circles denying and refusing the fact that we're too alike to stay together  Why can't you just  hear me  see me feel me like I am without pretenses without judgement  Why can't we just stay out of trouble and try to have fun for a change  Have you ever thought  that I'm sick because of you and you only?  So why don't you leave me alone let me heal myself from you   Depok, May 5, 2001                                                             Inspired by a song by Pink titled You Make Me Sick   UMBRELLA   I once saw an old woman walking barefoot across  an old bridge from the colonial time  she was carrying  a huge basket behind her back her clothes was shabby the animal and the flower print on it were fading just like her beauty against time  she was holding up  an umbrella against the sky the weird thing was it was closed  well, it wasn't raining at that time but the sun was fierce an open umbrella would do her good keeping her from sweating and lost more youth  Depok, May 25, 2001                                                               ALL I WANT  All I want is for him to see my needs All I need is for everybody to understand my wishes All I wish is for you to believe that all I really try to do is making you see that I just want to be by your side to enjoy your contagious grin your unbearably cute toothy smile your unmistakably funny laughter your stories and your ways of making me feel like the happiest girl on earth  whenever we’re together    Depok, June 15, 2001                                                               NIGHT FLIGHT   I don’t remember how many time I’ve passed this very freeway a way across hills and houses with lights at night the sensation is always the same like walking through a lake of starry nights a land full of scattered  jewels or lost in a deep forest of fireflies either way, I’m glad that I have the chance  to pass this beauty once again   Semarang, June 23, 2001                                                             To Semarang’s Freeway at night LIGHT SLEEPER INSOMNIAC  I’m an insomniac I’m a light sleeper and those two give me a hard time when I travel across the universe can’t sleep when it’s too cold or too hot can’t dream when I’m too tired or too excited  sleep a little, die a little so, always close those eyes  and pretend to drift off maybe in some way that act can fool and hypnotize your mind putting your snoring gently at the back seat of your consciousness  Yogyakarta, June 25, 2001                                                              LOVERS  I heard that you want to marry me but I want to cohabit  You said that you want this moment  to freeze, to stay put  But what I want is for you  to be like this to be romantic to be sweet to be gentle  All the time  Always  Without worrying about somebody or anybody or anything  Lovers can do almost everything in the name of their feelings for each other  Depok, July 11, 2001                                                             SHE   I saw concern  and worry in your eyes when you looked  at her sorrow  Was she the one  who broke your heart into a thousand pieces that not even me  could mend  You were smiling to hide your feelings jealousy and pity for he who won  her attention  She was either  too stupid or too blind for not even considering your unflawed soul  Or was she just like me who always feel awfully  sinful and improper around this too good to be true creature  Depok, July 11, 2001                                                              Forget her...!    LETTING GO IS HARD TO DO    They say that if you loved someone enough you’d be able to let him go  But they never mention the longing inside a hollowness the tears that stuck in your chest that make you feel like being killed slowly, alive and you can do nothing about it  Today I let you go  I let you live your life  one day at a time without hearing my voice seeing my face feeling what I’m feeling  I let myself drown  in my own pool of questions and what happen ifs that gutlessness of a woman who doesn’t want to hurt  another lover  Depok, August 2, 2001                                                               PERFECT WORLD   I want to vanish  into my own perfect world where ‘relationship’  can be wise, mature,  and understanding enough to give a blink of its lifetime to a fellowman called ‘affair’  Where you can live  by your own rules where you can cohabit where you can have doubts  in heaven and hell  and eternity  Where I can say anything to anyone without being worried  with the consequences or the bullshit crap called  responsibility  Where id wins the battle…. all the time  Depok, August 3, 2001                                                               NEVER   I'm losing sleep  and myself my entire universe is crushed into tiny bits of  regrets sorrow emptiness and stupidity of hanging on to something that can never be mended hoping that everything will be fine in the end but knowing that doubt will always haunt us  with restlessness  Depok, August 23, 2001                                                              Yesterday's heartache will always be remembered as tomorrow's reminder of how fragile I was then    VICIOUS CIRCLES   One of the things  that can eat your heart  and consciousness out in this hectic existence is facing the same problem over and over again with the same person in the same situation  And the one sane thing  that makes sense is trying to cope with it, not even thinking to fix anything  Depok, 9/8/01 10:58 PM                                                               UNREQUITED    The loudest sound the most unbearable feeling and the hardest thing that human has put up with is the unspoken love  It's the loneliest conversation when you're trying so hard  to let down your guts but the other person doesn't even realize that you're exist  Depok, September 26, 2001                                                               HASTE   Sometimes everything that matters has to be said out loud right away sometimes it's because someone doesn't even   bother to look around  Whatever that's been going on  inside private worlds they can't be that important compare to what everyone needs to let out  So stop being blind stop the ignorance just sit back and listen don't even let out a whisper  And whenever the truth  starts to overwhelmed the mind don't shut yourself out by looking the other way to run  Depok, September 30, 2001 11:41                                                              SISTER   I'm sorry For so long I forgot  that I have the obligation  to take care of you  to watch over you to protect you   I forgot that you are not  as strong as I am that you need me to guide you through to help you through stormy path of growing up  Now that the damage is done and you finally can keep your head held high laughing and smiling guilt will haunt me for the rest of my life that somehow I failed you  not be able to keep you from falling in love  and learned the lesson of life the hard way  Depok, October 8, 2001 11:52 PM                                                               OPPOSITE   We cannot see each other as often as I want to Our waking hours are different  mine are when every grass is fast asleep all the lights are too tired to open their eyes dreams are wondering around sneaking into bedrooms and couches  looking forward a chance to squeeze themselves between sleep and awake  yours are when doors open their arms  cats nod theirs head, resting in front of the TV set buses and trains are creating traffic with every mind inside them cursing and swearing wishing and hoping time could go faster than ever  So don't walk away  if my time is not enough  to make you understand what I really feel for you   Depok, October 23, 2001 12:29 AM                                                               THERE'S A REASON WHY   I often sit apart from the crowd pretending to be in a deep sleep or in a deep conversation with myself or talking with a book covering my gaze  I'm not that crazy about music but I would like to thank the person  who came up with the brilliant idea of inventing  a selfish way to listen  I turn on my walkman and put on the earphones when I don't feel like talking   I don't get along with people very well  because I have a gift for dealing with children  and animals  Depok, October 25, 2001 1:35 AM                                                               DREAM   I was in the middle of laughter and conversations trying to make sense  of what I wanted to see I wanted to feel  I sought for a soul so old that I knew well  he turned and smiled mouthed 'don't you worry I'll be there to hold your heart' then he walked away without waving or crying  next thing I knew I woke up  with the worst hang-over  which was an emptiness inside my chest  Depok, October 29, 2001 11:53 PM                                                               THUNDERBOLT   She started to lock her bedroom door since she piled up secrets  up in her womb  Not that I care so much but her world is not hers entirely she keeps many things  things that don't belong to her  exclusively and a lot will be going on  without her   She still thinks  the universe is for keep She has a hard time understanding that she's not alone she's just lonely  Depok, October 31, 2001 11:08 AM                                                               REVERIES   I don't sell anything that I don't claim I'm offering nothing that you cannot handle if you're not happy with the things that you see in me you can always walk away because I need every space that I can get stay far so I'll be able to feed my brains with melodies and rhymes from ancient scholars  or new age generation  I want to soar beyond this time and place sing complicated heartaches in glamorous cities  I'll write twisted tales and contorted characters then sold them to the highest kisser last but not least I will exploring the world map leave a mark of myself on every inch of this planet  I'm a dreamer so if you see me all alone humming unusual songs  whispering to myself  or stuck my head on yellowing pages just look away and go quietly I might be in a deep sleep   Depok, November 1, 2001 1:52 AM                                                               DEVOTED   I've lost all energy all the will to even think I never thought  being in a relationship  for too long can be so overwhelming not that I don't love you anymore I just lost a little bit  of interest  Jakarta, November 22, 2001   SPLIT   Is it true  that breaking up  is contagious?  Like yawning or chicken pox  or laughter  Why is it  that something so damaging has a right to spread its influence?   Because I can't help  feeling so down hearing the sound of a broken hope  Specially when I personally grow that hope  Depok, December 5, 2001 10:35 AM  Hang in there Dit!    REFLECTION   I have doubts again whether or not  I could trust you  with my whole life  Why?  Because you cannot accept that I'm sensitive that I tend to cry when I'm hurt that I made you look bad  Honey, I thought that loving  means taking everything as it is the good and the bad the high and the low  If you told me to be more reflective have you seen yourself  in the mirror  lately?
