        Current Mood: sicklyish (not quite as bad as  "sick")  Current Music: none.. on the phone  Mozilla: Wateroyster    I got all my settings the way I want them now, I think, so now I'm ready for a real post.  So, yeah.. my life the last few weeks...  Well, for those of  you comletely out of the loop - I'm up in Maine with Daddy this summer.  He's working at the MeadWestvaco plant till October, then he has a couple weeks off, then he goes to Maryland for a few months.  But this isn't his blog, so moving on...  I'm just getting over mono.   (Don't ask me where I got it - I haven't seen Tom since April (and we're not together now, anyways) and if you knew the boys at my school...  *shudders* yeah.. not an option.  But I read that sometimes someone'll have the virus, but never develop the symptoms, so they can still pass it on to someone unknowingly, like by sharing drinks or coughing or something like that... So I imagine that's how I got it.)    It kinda sucks that I got it during the summer, cuz I was basically holed up in the house for an entire month.  Not that I really have a problem with that.  I'm prefectly fine staying home all day doing nothing (as long as I have a computer with internet) but I wanted to hike and do other outdoor stuff this summer since I don't get many opportunities to.  Oh well, I'm better now, and we've been cramming a bunch of stuff into my last month, to make up for lost time, so it's all good.  But if I had to get it, I'd prefer summer instead of during school, cuz that would've seriously sucked.  Ahh, yes, almost forgot about this.  Daddy and I had *quite* an adventure the other day.  I'll just paste what I told Pete about it, so I don't have to type it all up again.  ok.. yesterday afternoon, daddy and i went kayaking... started out as a really nice hot pretty day.  then after we'd been out like 45 minutes... we notice this big gray cloud in the sky... and hear this long, low, rumbling thunder..  so, we start paddling really really fast trying to find a nice level spot on the bank to get out at.  so we do that, and we set under some trees... and it starts sprinkling... and then it starts raining... and then it starts pouring... and then it pours harder... and then it pours even harder... and then we start getting pelted with hail.. really hard.. for like five minutes...... then it stops hailing.. but keeps pouring.. so we're sitting up on the river bank for like an hour and a half, and the rain lets up some, so we get back in our kayaks, and we have to go over to the other side so we can get up by the highway.  and it's much steeper on that side, so we have to struggle just to get up the bank, not to mention dragging the kayaks.  then we have to walk around this big long wheat field.. and we get to the highway.. and we have to walk two miles back to the house... while it's still raining, mind you, so we run in and change clothes, and get in the car and daddy gets out where we left the kayaks and i drive back home.. and he brings a rope and ties the two kayaks together and finishes kayaking to where we initially left the truck... and.. yeah.. i was absolutely freezing.. it was quite an afternoon.. i don't ever wanna get hailed on again... but it was pretty funny     Oh yeah, I kinda sorta halfway got a webdesign job.  Daddy was taking me to the doctor a couple weeks ago, and we had a little time to kill, so we went into this  computer store and daddy told the people that I liked computers and made webpages and we so we started talking about it.  So I made a few layouts and went over there a  couple times to show them what I'd made.  I mean, the stuff was obviously pretty amateur, but it looked pretty decent.  And of course,  the more I make, the better my Photoshop and CSS skills get.  They particularly liked this one I made with a really cool picture Pete took.  (I'll add a link to it when I get it all set up - they gave me a subdomain on their site,  and I'm working on uploading all of them and making the main page that links to all the layouts, but I'm having trouble with transparent  .pngs in  IE...  anyone know javascript...? *hopeful*)  Anyways, they'd obviously only use me for a small project, and those just kinda come as they come, so I won't really get to actually do any work for them most likely, but they said quite a few times that I could set up my own little business starting with like friends and  family, and I could contact them if I needed any help.  And they got my number here and in Florida, so I'm pretty happy with it.  Just hope I can get something actually going...  I think it should work out tho.  Cindy's parents are here this weekend.  They got here yesterday, and they're staying  for a few days then driving to some places around then coming back here for a few more days, then going home.  They all went to Mt. Washington or something in New Hampshire, but I stayed home since I don't feel well.  So it's just me and Sam (Cindy's dog) he's laying in here on the floor and I'm laying on my bed and we're both just being lazy... fun stuff

       Well... I decided it was time for me to get a blog up and  going. I have my old  urlLink blurty , but that didn't work out too well.  So I decided to try Blogger, LJ, and Xanga, and Blogger won, mainly cuz of this  awesome skin/template whatever you wanna call it thing (and cuz  urlLink Zach's  looked  really cool too, altho it's not very colorful.)  I'll prolly stick to  this template  for  awhile, tho I might tweak it  a  bit.    Anyways, I'm just gonna go do this post  for now, fix up all my settings, then make an actual post later tonight or tomorrow.

        Current Mood:  boredish  Current Music:  Trading Spaces on TV  Mozilla:  Speckledspider       ...to stand straight up in a kayak for over two minutes without falling.  But, I'll get to that in a minute.  This weekend has been pretty fun... and I still have Sunday to go.  Daddy took Friday off, and he and I went to Freeport for the day.  It was really weird, cuz it was like an inside out mall.  Like, there was a bath and body works, wilsons leather, abercrombie, banana republic, gap, and a bunch of stores like that, but they were all separate buildings.  And they had a bunch of local touristy shops and restaurants too.  It was pretty neat tho.  I got a really cute hot pink monogram leather purse, a stuffed animal lobster, a toy 1950s pink corvette convertible, and these nifty little 50s/60s vintagey pictures with a bunch of cynical captions.  They were actually postcards, but I'm gonna use them to decorate.  And Daddy got me these cute blue, rhinestony flip-flop shaped earrings.  We got ice cream from Diary Queen on the way there..  Oh!  I still have half my blizzard in the freezer!  *runs to freezer and returns 10 minutes later...*  Ok, *sigh* that's better.  Anyways, we got ice cream, and picked up some lobster and clam chowder to eat when we got home.  And I was really tired..  I went to bed at 11, and fell asleep within 30 minutes..  But that was prolly cuz I was up till 4:30 the night before.  Anyways, then today I slept till about 11.  Daddy was getting after me for sleeping so much.. then a bit later, I followed him upstairs, and laid down on the bed while he was rummaging through stuff or something, then he finished, and laid down beside me, and he was asleep in like 5 minutes, lol.  I went and ate breakfast/lunch and then went and jumped on the bed and scared the crap outta him.  Then we both just spent about 20 minutes pestering and tickling each other...  it was fun.  Then after we got up and going, Daddy, Cindy, and I went kayaking on the river behind the house.  We had been going about 30 minutes, and Daddy said, I bet I can stand up in this thing... and Cindy and I were like, what!? are you crazy?  So he tried, and he got halfway up, then it wobbled and he sit back down... and I was like wow, I wanna try!  So I passed my stuff to Daddy to hold, and tried.  It's pretty hard to do.  I got half way up two different times, then had to sit back down cuz I wasn't balanced.  Then the third time I got close to all the way up, and I fell in...  It was cool tho, cuz the water felt really good.. even tho it was pretty cold.  Then Daddy was amazed that I crawled back into the kayak from the water without flipping.  Ahh.. I'm just that good..  hehe, anyways..  when I got back in, I tried a few more times, and I got up a little more each time.. then I finally stood all the way up.  I did that like four or five separate times.. and one time that Cindy was videoing, I was standing completely straight up for over two minutes.  Daddy was absolutely amazed..  He didn't believe that my balancing skills were as good as I said they were.  And of course, he had to try again.. and he did finally get all the way up, but only for about 15-20 seconds.  And if you think this story is not that amazing...  then you're dumb.  It's very hard to do (except for me.)  Try it sometime, you'll see.  Oh, and we tooks some pics and videos..  I'll post a link when I get my site..  we tried to get it tonight, but I was having issues getting it to accept Daddy's credit card.

        Current Mood:  kinda depressed..  Current Music:  Hungry Eyes - Eric Carmen  Mozilla:  Firepig       Well..  I was all bubbly and happy like not even an hour ago.  I had talked to David for 76 minutes (I looked at the timer before I hung up) and I was listening to my Hilary Duff CD, which is very good happy music, and I was chatting with Robyn and Will and Pete, so everything was all cool.  Then I was reading Robyn's and Zach's blogs, and they were talking about school starting, and I started missing everybody.  I'm still not too happy about living in Florida,  if you didn't already know that.  I mean, I get to hang out with Chelsea and family a lot, and I have a really awesome school, and, of course David's there.. (altho I haven't gotten to enjoy that yet, lol)  But, still..  I absolutely *hate* that I'm not going to high school with y'all (I'm not bothering to clarify who y'all is.. you guys know.)  It just doesn't feel right.  Ever since we all started hanging out in 6th grade, I was looking forward to growing up together, and prom, and dates, and hanging out, and all that crazy teenage stuff.  (This includes Rachel too.. cuz she coulda at least driven down to hang out with us)  Grr..  stupid father's midlife crisis...  Oh well.  I don't mean to be giving this big huge sob story.  Just wanna make sure you guys know that I love and miss you all terribly..  *sniffle..*  Seriously, you guys are really, really awesome..  I'm really glad I have friends like you, even if I hardly ever get to see you.

        Current Mood:  relaxed/sleepy  Current Music:  Wonderful Tonight - Eric Clapton  Mozilla:  Supercow       Yesterday, I woke up, checked my e-mail, and I had a long reply to this long e-mail I sent Tom the other day.  I read it a few times, then just sat there for a few minutes, cuz I wasn't sure what to think, then I called  him, and we talked for about an hour, and I cried like three different times, cuz apparantly, to Tom, if we're not getting back together, then that means that our entire relationship was just one big mistake and nothing but a bunch of bad memories...  *sigh* that's a real ego booster, lemme tell ya...  Anyways, then I called David, since I was all upset, and he helped me a lot.  Then I had some Ben & Jerry's (for breakfast) and just chilled for a few minutes, and then I was all better.  Then awhile later I had to take the garbage to the dump/recycling center.   I hated having to change outta my PJs to go out for not even 10 minutes, cuz the place is just right down the road.  haha, I'm so lazy.  Then I just basically spent the day on the computer... of course.  We were gonna go hiking or something when Daddy and Cindy got home from work, but I was still tired from the day before.  They considered going anyway, but they decided to stay home, which turned out to be a good thing, cuz there was a really strong thunderstorm.  It didn't last very long, though.  As soon as it started pouring, Daddy was like, "see, I told you we should have gone kayaking.."  It was amusing.  Then it started lightning, and Daddy turned off the desktop/dsl/router, so I was forced to do something else for about 30-45 minutes.  So I got out these beads Cindy bought me earlier this summer and made a necklace with some fishing line.  I finished stringing the beads, but I haven't determined how I'm gonna make the closure part yet.  Well, I'm $175 richer now.  Daddy bribed me... more or less.  We were planning on going to Boston this weekend, and Daddy was like "I'm not sure if we should go cuz it's supposed to be raining all weekend," and I was like, "well, that won't matter," and he was like, "yeah, it'll mess up our hiking," and I was like, "hiking!?  we're not going to Boston to hike!  we're going to shop!"  and then he was like, "shopping!?  if you wanna shop, we can just go to Freeport," (this city about an hour and a half or two hours away) and I was like, "...but..  I wanna go to Boston..."  So then a few minutes later, Daddy was like, "ok, we can go to Boston.. or we can go to Freeport and I'll give you $150 to spend.. you have 10 minutes to gimme an answer."  And I totally wasn't expecting that.  So I started frantically looking online for stuff to do in Boston, to see if I could stand not going.   (btw, the  urlLink musuem of science  there has a laser show to Dark Side of the Moon, which sounded really neat.  and a lotr exhibit I was *dying* to go to...)   Then a lil bit later, he was like, "ok, 175.  and you have three minutes now," so I reluctantly opted for Freeport and the money..  That much money's hard to turn down.  And we decided not to go to Boston cuz of the rain, cuz we need to spend more than a weekend there, and cuz my energy still isn't totally up to par.  But I told him he has to take me before I graduate college.  And I haven't really done anything today either.  Spent a couple hours on the computer when I woke up, took a shower, talked to David, and cleaned my room up some.  And now I'm fixin to take a nap...

        Current Mood:  exhausted  Current Music:  Why Not - Hilary Duff  Mozilla:  Rainbowshark       I woke up at 11:52 this morning (after my itching fiasco) cuz Daddy called to say that he and Cindy were on their way home and we were gonna go on this hiking/swimming thing.  So I got up, called David, and got ready to go.  We stopped and got lunch on the way there, and Daddy was being a punk and teasing me cuz there was this teenage boy working at the restaurant.  Thank goodness he didn't actually say anything to him tho, cuz he's not beyond that.  Cindy and I were both afraid he was gonna do something stupid.  But, anyways, we went to Angel Falls, which is this really pretty waterfall, obviously, that you have to make a short hike (about two and a half miles there and back) to get to, and then you can get in the water, which was quite freezing... cuz this is Maine, after all.  Ya know that Sierra Mist commercial where the monkey catapults into the pond or whatever and then sings a really long, high note?  That's what the water felt like.  Seriously, like you can't get into the water without singing a note like that..   it's instinctive.  I'm convinced that's the secret to all the really good opera stars' success.  We got some really cool pictures too, and a few video clips.  If anyone wants to see them, let me know; they're way gorgeous.  And I found a frog.  I took a couple pictures of him and carried him around for a few minutes..  but I left him back in his home before we left.  Then we drove to this scenic overlook place called Height of the Land, and got some more really good pictures.  There was a lake/pond with mountains in the background, and the sun shining through the  clouds.  Very pretty.  And I got some really cool close up pictures of some flowers.  My camera has this setting called "macro" which lets you take pics close up with really good detail.  I'm anxious to look at them on the computer and see how they look.  After that, we headed back home and stopped at the same restaurant and got some ice cream to take with us, and that teenage boy was serving us, and after we were back in the car for a bit, I commented on how the ice cream was really cheap, and Daddy was like "I don't think he charged us for your root beer float..." and I just kinda playfully glared at him.  He was still being a punk..  but it was funny.  Anyways..  we got home, I took a shower, called Mommy, and got on the computer.  And  I am utterly exhausted.  But it was a really fun day.

        Current Mood:  sleepy and itchy  Current Music:  Forever and For Always - Shania Twain  Mozilla:  Spacenarwhal       I just woke up to an in insanely strong itchy feeling about 20 minutes ago.  I got poison ivy on my butt and a little on my leg from having to sit on the river bank during that hail storm, (I was wearing a swim suit). It wasn't that bad before, but, omg, it itched  so  bad when I woke up.   I nearly cried... like literally, it was so painful.  I got outta bed, and asked daddy where the stuff for it was (he bought a bunch the other day, cuz he got it on his legs too) and he went to the car and got this cooling spray stuff for me.  And I feel much better now.  Except for the waking up at 6 after going to sleep at 3:30 part.  And I'm waiting for Cindy's dad to get out of the shower, cuz I have to pee really really bad...  then I can go back to sleep.

        Current Mood:  Aggravated in an apathetical sorta way  Current Music:  You Raise Me Up - Selah (not as good as Josh Groban)  Mozilla:  Speckledpig       Well, I was feeling better today.  I went out with Cindy and her parents and ate lunch.  I got a strawberry slushee.  I forgot how good those things are!  I'm gonna have to eat/drink those more often.  Then we went to Wal-mart and I got the cutest reversible bucket hats for $1.00 each!!  I was so excited about that.. (lol, my life sure is thrilling..)  Then we went to this little Maine book  and gift store.  Then we stopped at this scenic place and I took some dam pictures (as in pictures of a dam...  haha.. ha..)  They were actually really pretty tho.  Then I came home and talked to David for a couple hours (I am fully digging his unlimited cell phone minutes), ate supper, got on the computer, and here I am.  I'm kinda annoyed at Tom right now.  We had an argument.. thing last night about David.  ugh.. the drama.  It's so weird, he breaks up with me, I'm heart broken and try to convince him that he doesn't really wanna break up with me, it doesn't work..  I get over it, *then* he says he made a mistake and wants us to get back together.  And of course, by this point, we've been broken up for two months, so I'm over it, and I'm  moving on, and he has a cow.  *sigh....*  Hilary Duff's "So Yesterday" sums up my feelings right now.  Not in like a mean, haha, I'm over you, go to hell kinda way or anything...  but like in a ok, you're being really weird about this, but I'm not gonna let it get to me kinda way.   You can change your life (if you wanna) You can change your clothes (if you wanna) If you change your mind Well that's the way it goes  But I'm gonna keep your jeans **or pajama pants** And your old black hat (cuz I wanna) They look good on me You're never gonna get them back  At least not today, not today, not today, cuz...  If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday I'm just a bird  Thats already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be ok  You can say you're bored (if you wanna) You could act real tough (if you wanna) You could say you're torn But I've heard enough  Thank you You've made my mind up for me When you started to ignore me You won't see a single tear It isn't gonna happen here  At least not today, not today, not today, cuz...  If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday I'm just a bird  Thats already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be ok  If you're over me I'm already over you If it's all been done What is left to do How can you hang up If the line is dead If you wanna walk out I'm a step ahead If you're moving on I'm already gone If the light is off Then it isn't on  At least not today, not today, not today, cuz...  If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday I'm just a bird  Thats already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday Haven't you heard that you're (so yesterday)  If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday I'm just a bird  Thats already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be ok

        Current Mood:  indifferent  Current Music:  Foolish Games - Jewel  Mozilla:  Firepanda       Well, this weekend has been rather uneventful.  I literally just spent the last two days in my bed playing on the computer all day.  Didn't feel up to much else.  Well, I did talk to David a few different times for awhile.   (For those of you I haven't already told, David is this really awesome, incredibly sweet, nearly perfect guy I met online that lives in Cape Coral (a city right next to Fort Myers.))  But that's about all I did.  Maybe I'll be better tomorrow... but there's not much else to do, so I  guess I'll just play on the computer in the living room instead of my bedroom, lol.  Cindy got me a new digital camera a few days ago for my high ACT/AP scores.  (ACT, 32 - Calculus BC, 5 - Microeconomics, 4 - Physics B, 3)  I was totally shocked, cuz Daddy already let me spend like $100 online buying stuff to celebrate.  (btw, I  still have $26.19 left.  Post a comment if you know what I should get.)  It was really funny tho, cuz he was like "Shanna, come here.  Sit down, I wanna talk to you."  And I was like "omg.. omg.. omg..  I'm in trouble."  I thought he was gonna like yell at me for giving David my number or something.  But it was all good.  It's a nice camera too.   urlLink Canon A300 .  3.2 megapixels, 5.1x zoom.  I'm happy.
