      The day started like any normal day. Spent quality time with cow shit in the morning and then came home. But when I came home, I had the pleasure of trying to inform the soccer team of our game in De Pere that evening. That was an adventure. Called 10 people, left messages by all but 3. We ended up cancelling it anyway, thank God. So instead I went in my yard and kicked a ball around for a while just to pass the time because the Brewers are in the midst of a horrendous offense stretch. I actually caught Adult Swim tonight. Family Guy, Futurama, and Aqua Teen Hunger Force were all of good quality. So until something interesting happens, everyone who reads this will be forced to be as bored as me. But I'm assuming it'll only be Bob. Sorry Bob. I'll try harder tomorrow. Bacon out.

      Well, yesterday I went to warped tour with my gay and lesbian friends from Kiel. I have to say that it was a rocking time. I got to see Story of the Year, which blew my fucking ass away. The pure energy that just flowed off of the stage and into every soul jamming at the concert was so intense. I really didn't expect much from the other bands that I saw, basically because I knew nothing of their musical endeavors. But I would have to say that Flogging Molly and Billy Talent really left a good impression on me. So good in fact that I decieded to download their music. Illegaly of course. It was the only way I could really show my appreciation towards them. Other than not being able to hear for most of the day, it went by pretty typical. Went to the farm for a while in the morning, came home, played a little Metroid on the JNES, and reffed a meaningless soccer game. Oh, and I created this incredibly awesome web blog. Yea, that's it. Until we meat again, Bacon out.

      Today was the last day of Lakeland Music camp, and that's a bad thing cuz that means I don't get to see Mello for a long time. *Tear*. But we'll still see effort to see each other. I'm breaking the mold from all the other posts (2), and I'm doing this bad boy in the middle of the day rather than at the end of one. I'm talking to Mello right now, and soon I'll be goin to the alumni football game, but that's to hear the alumni band. Should be fun. Maybe. Until we meet again, Bacon out.
