      Aaaah, last few days I've done NOTHING, what-so-ever. Sure, sure, it has been rather dull, but at the same time, it has been rather soothing too! I've been watching a lot of babylon 5, which is Such a great show. I didn't write anything in the blog yestarday because, well, I was watching babylon 5, and now that I've written one log each day of the first week, I feel I'll only write when something interesting happens. And well, now,  I write, 'cause I figured I should tell ya'll (all you people who read my blog, all 0 of you).  I miss my girlfriend so much..  I don't think she misses me, she has other things on her mind (she's in england, good for her, bad for me :p).     oh well, till next time, tata

      I'm so lonely.. I haven't been outside in two hole days, which is much too long! the reason I haven't been out is, First off, noone's home, so theres no need for me to get up early to go to anyone. And I've been sleeping till 6 pm, so I'm in " sleep mode " till 10 pm. I miss my girlfriend ever so much.. I hate beeing all sentimental :/ I didn't realise I was sentimental untill I met her. I recieved an e-mail from her yesterday. I was so happy, but my e-mail fucked :/ so i had to send the mail like 3 times, I don't know if any of them, or all of them for that matter, got sent. I hope the first one i wrote got sent, that was the one that was the best. I defantly hope I didn't send all three, she'll think I'm stupid or something..   I've been watching a lot of babylon 5 lately, I had forgotten how great it was. I hadn't seen the firsts episodes when i was little, and I've noticed, the mention white stars and "the shadow" a lot! before they both started showing up in the show. I remember in one episode, when two workers where sitting in a window eating their lunch, and one of them mentioned how he thought the white star's all looked like a plukked chicken.    oh well, *End of transmission*

       Home , at last, back from the  lan. I was there for a week, my back is killing me, I've been sleeping  on a couch that iches like crap, glad to be home again. Nevertheless, I  had a great time really.. nothing more to say on that matter.  I  want to learn how to program in c#, I really do, I did a basic program  just for practice saying "hello world". Now that I'm back home I don't  know what to do, I'm making legs for my "Gai sensei" pic but i can't  draw his feet :,/. Tomorrow's the 18'th, or well, its past 12pm so its  technically the 18'th, and my girlfriend comes home in 10 days.   I'm still taking situps each night, i don't want to rot here, I  figured, I'm always so inactive i have to do something to keep myself  from getting too fat. I watched 3 top gear episodes today, which all  rocked(I mean, duh, of course they did..). I haven't really done  anything today, besides gotten up at 3 pm,  had my mom come pic me  and my computer up from the lan, taken a shower, and relaxed. I guess I  should finish "Gai sensei"s feet before i go to bed..

      today has been the most boring day, ever. You can't even begin to imagine how extreamly dull my day has been. I mean, I've spent hours just sitting here, on a couch, at a lan (if you had read my previous posts you would know im at a lan). I mean, I have been amused about 10% of the day, which i've spent; walking to the quick-e-mart and back, playing Sven-coop with DilyX, watching naruto ep 90 (Which so totally owns btw). Also, today my mailing service fucked, www.portalen.no is currently fucked up, so I can't recive or send e-mails, which is quite fustrating concidering that i dont know if the e-mail i sent to my girlfriend ever *got* sent or not (again, there are just 3 other posts so far, just go read em..). Nor do I know if she has replied saying something in the lines of either "Fuck off shittard" or "miss you, love and kisses". I spent 7 minutes drawing today, 'cause i figure i should draw stuff atleast once a day. Today i drew a whale in OC, shaded in photoshop. By the way, about 4 of those 7 minutes where spent figuring out wtf i was going to draw..      oooh well.. let's hope something happens tomorrow..

       I'm so happy!   Hah! I'm so happy! It's only 7pm here in norway, so it's a bit early to tell you about my day, but if anything else interesting happens today I'll tell you tomorrow. The reason for my extra ordinary ammount of joy today is; My girlfriend sendt me mail! and Today it's been a week since i last heard from her, which is way to long! The reason I havn't heard from her in a week is, she's in torquay - or something, some little place in england, she says it's quite beutifull. Anyway, I've been thinking *so* much about her the past week and I've really missed her, I've checked my mail every day to see if she had sent a mail, but every day (up untill today) I've gotten dissapointed. When I saw she'd sent me a mail, I think my heart may have jumped a little, atleast it felt like it. The mail said something of the lines of; "I'm having fun, miss you", fairly longer of course but that's basicly what it said. I'm so happy! I feel like running! I want to run and run and run, run overseas to england and find her! kiss her, make sure she's having a good time, then run back again! if it wasn't humanly impossible I'd do it! I'm so happy. I don't think she misses me a lot, I just hope shes having a good time and takes time to think of me every once in a while.   In other news;   I've completed two pictures today, a wallpaper consisting of several pictures I've drawn the last three days (check it out at jaypea.deviantart.com, it's called OC wallpaper), and a picture of a pirate rat (check that out too, still jaypea.deviantart.com, it's called pirate rat, I think).   I'm at a lan (I have been the past week, since she left).  One of my friends (it's his house I'm laning at, let's call him DilyX) father is turning 49 today. grats @ him.  Another one of my friends (let's call him ZarXoz) has gotten a cell today, let's welcome him into the world of the 21 century.    Thats today for ya.. so far anyway

       What I hate!   I have found out two things about myself the past 12 hours.   1. When I eat gum with mint flavor or smell mint, I think of my wonderfull girlfriend. I miss her ever so much (she's in england at the moment, hope she's having fun, I havn't heard from her yet, she comes home on my birthday). When people call me "dust" (no, not the gray stuff, its notwegian for "moron") I think of her, she call's tells me I'm a moron whenever I say something she doesn't like, but I think she likes it a bit anyway, 'cause then she gets to call me moron. And when she call's me moron, its not that avrage "dust..", she sais it in *such* a cute way, it's more of a "dus-s-st), like shes saying it with her tounge up infront of her teeth ^_^. So now I no longer get offended when people call me moron, I get happy and start thinking of her :D.  2. I have now realised, I am as evil as all you other people, I too have something to hate. I am not as angelic as I once thought, I thought I was incapeable of hating.. I have been proven wrong. I  HATE , the end on wieners. You know, theres like "the wiener" and then theres "the wiener end", I'll draw it for you!        >(000000000) " and "   anyway, that's today for ya..

       *Hello spase peepole*   yarr, this be my ( jaypea )'s first entry, I hope to get comments from whoever might read it ^_^. I'm new to this hole "blog" thing but I'll do my best to make a fun log for ya'll to read. I don't really have anything to complane about at the moment so I'll tell you all a little about myself.  My name is undisclosed, my friends call me JP. I live in norway, I was born 28'th of July, 1988. I have a very cute and funny girlfriend who has a very special place in my heart, she probably wont read this blog though.. shame really 'cause I'll prolly say a lot of positive things about her in it. I like metal, and almost all the sub-genres. I like a lot of diffrent animals (not a fan of horses though, unless theyr steeds!), I have a dog and a cat, the cat just had kittens but we've given them all away (so sad, I grew ever so attached to them.. well not really but they where fun to play with ^_^). I have a brother, and both my parents, we all live together (one big happy fammily, woop de-do..). I like reading (well, depends on the book, of course), being in scout (yes, I know, geeky, never the less quite social and you get to do a lot of fun stuff), computers, and making shitty wannabie pieces of art (check them out at Jaypea.deviantart.com). Now i could yap on and on about my dislikes but theres just too much to yap on about! However, I will tell you all now, I  HATE , well, nothing ^_^, I just dislike a lot of stuff that's all, however, if I start hating something you'll all be the last to know ^_^)  anyway, if you have any questions about me, ask, I'll prolly answer 'em as best I can.
