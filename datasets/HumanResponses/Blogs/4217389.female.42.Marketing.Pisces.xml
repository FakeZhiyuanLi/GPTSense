        The Pitch  The first piece of information that an editor should see in your media kit is your “pitch” letter. This letter needs to immediately grab the editor’s attention. It should be typed or printed on a letter-quality computer printer in black and on standard-sized 8.5” x 11” stationery. Address it to your contact because editors typically disregard “blind” or “cold” letters.    Media Releases or Articles  Include a press release or feature article in your kit. Describe what you do in detail and provide the editor with enough newsworthy material to enable him or her to write a story about you directly from the release. The press release should also be typed or printed on a letter-quality computer printer in black on your letterhead stationery.    Business Card  Include your business card. Your business card should contain your name and title, company name, address, phone, fax, and/or any other communication avenue open to you e-mail or other. You should clip (not staple) it to the top left-hand corner of the “pitch” letter, or at the top left-hand corner of the press release, if you have decided against enclosing a “pitch” letter.    Your Background  Include a brief description of your background, accomplishments and education.  It should be printed on your letterhead in the same manner as the “pitch” letter and the press release. Include the name of your contact as a header or title, in larger type, at the top of the page. Indicate that this is your background profile or biographical profile.    Photos  Your photos or slides can support the press release and create a more compelling story. Use color and black and white photos if possible.    Testimonials  A testimonial sheet should be a one-page collection of quotes from anyone who has praised you or your work and is willing to publicly support it. Again, use your letterhead for the testimonials.    Data Sheet  A data sheet should contain all of the important statistics about you including your height, weight, hair color, eye color, date and place of birth.  Print it on letterhead with “Data Sheet” centered in bold at the top of the sheet. (Frequently used by Performing Artists.)   Folder  Create a vivid folder to hold all of your press materials and should be simple in design—perhaps with your logo and contact information. The folder size should be 9” x 12” with an insert on the right or left-hand side for your business card.    (c)2003 Bullhorn Media.  Courtesy www.bullhornmedia.com

       PR Firms - also known as public relations firms - execute ongoing activities to ensure the client has a strong public image. Public relations campaigns are most often conducted through the internet, newspapers, television and magazines. Advertising firms promote a product or service, and help to attract the attention of potential and current customers. Publicity firms help the client gain the attention of the media.

       Brand development can be tricky business. It takes research and highly experienced teams to produce a brand concept that embraces the consumer's identity and then gains their acceptance. I've watched executives and professionals (in the entertainment and arts) conduct marketing and branding through desperation. Marketing cannot be without focus and clearly defined objective thinking. The "trick" is, to capture your unique story and tell it powerfully. It's actually no trick, but essential for success. Why? Because people "buy" from people. Yeah, sure, it's about the relationship. We've heard that before. But what does that imply, really? Bullhorn Media is one of Los Angeles' fastest growing firms and they've apparently got it right. Bullhorn uses an integrated marketing and media approach. Working across publicity and media and public relations channels, they mix advertising, marketing strategy, psychology, marketing research, promotion, print, live (radio/tv) and digital media to deliver their client's message. While Bullhorn Media is not a media buyer, their expertise rests in selling a buyer-to-seller "bonding" experience.

       Thought for the day:  To live life to the fullest is grand. To write about it is divine. Beauty fades... as does the memory of it.

        In the marketing and promotions world, it's not unusual to find companies trying, sometimes desperately, to bond with the prospective consumer. Have you seen Coca-Cola's new C2 ads? After several minutes of fun and feel-good, they tell you it all can be yours with a colorful new beverage. Well back in the day it had some  real  juice . . . and probably a few addicts. Have times changed that much? Well the point of all this blather is that human response to what we see visually doesn't change much over time. Stereotypes, culture, symbolism, myth, and beliefs are so deeply embedded in our psyche that we respond to ads (usually the way advertisers intend) without much thought.      Let's take this one step further. Whether you're feeling crazy, funky, preppy, trendy, hip, or traditional, the image you project causes people around you to make similar associations. Clothing, hairstyle, hair color (facial hair or not), and accessories all play a role in creating an advertisement for YOU. So, I ask you compadres, who are you going to be today? The beautiful thing is, you can be whatever you want. Carpe diem.
