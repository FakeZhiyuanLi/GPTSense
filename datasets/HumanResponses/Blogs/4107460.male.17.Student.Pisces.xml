        Saturday and Sunday two days in a week the end and the beginning usually just time for me to chill and relax from school. But not this weekend, this weekend was awesome! First I got up Saturday and went to work, works not that great but I was feeling really good and energetic. After work I went to the local computer store because all though I am way cool and handsome, I am a geek. So I talked my folks into giving me money to get a new DVD Burner Combo drive, which is awesome. Then I went home and took a shower because I had a date with a really cool girl I met at my new school and her really cool friends which are now mine also. We had a great time, we caught a movie and a meal. Alien Vs. Predator was kinda weak and we spent most of our time joking it. Then we got some pizza and shot pool at Roxy's house. Now we are at Sunday and I slept late, got all my lost sleep back. Then I went to see Calateral with my best friend and his girl and roxy and abbie. Great movie and a great time. So I had a jampacked and exciting weekend. Met a lot of new people and stayed busy. I'm not sure that I will be able to top it for a while, but oh well.

        Today is my first absence this year and its only the second week! This was not by choice though, I enjoy my new school besides the uncomplete construction and lunches. I got up at my regular time this morning to get a shower and be ready for my ride, but when I got to the bathroom it is already being occupied by both of my parents. I asked them why they weren't already ready and leaving. They had no answer, this pissed me off because they both get up at 5:30 and it was now 7:00 they have had plenty of time to get ready and be out of my way. So I didn't have time to get ready and missed my ride. I hope they write me a good excuse so I can make up the TEST I missed today!

        We had an awsome youth rally at my church today. We had and incredible speaker from Faulkner Universty and Cornerstone the schools musical group. We also had our own Dayspring preform which is a group comprised of a few friends of mine who can sing awsomely. The preformance was great. I had a great time and am looking forward to toping it next year.

        The Higher you feel then the worse it hurts when you fall. I had gotten very excited about the possible hook-up with this girl at my school who was having trouble with her boy-friend/x-boy-friend. They had broken up and we were going to go out this weekend and we had been talking previously, but then the prementioned guy calls her up and shoots her some apolegetic and sweet bull-crap and has dashed my hopes upon the jagged metaphorical rocks. Well she is out of the picture, guess I gotta move on. There are plenty of fish in the sea and I have a really big net!

        My X-girlfriend and I have been apart for comming on three months. I haven't been handling this as well as she. I missed her bad for the longest time and wasn't interested in seeing anyone else. No other girls at my school or that I know appealed to me I had either already dated them or didn't want to. The city and county high schools have merged into one now and there is a whole new selection of girls. Yes there are several gorgeous girls here, but do we have anything in common. Yes!!!! I am extremely stocked about my date with one of the most beautiful and intelligent blondes I have ever met. I've now found that moving on and getting over my X is going to be a lot easier.

        These two friends of mine have birthdays in the same week, so they decide to have a joint b-day party. So we have a pool party Brandons(one of the b-day boys). Me, Jordan(the other one), and Brandon all go out and get supplies. This is were we go wrong we start inviting people that Friday and the party is Saturday. Much to Jordan and Brandons supprise most people have plans already and not many show up. DUH!!! I tried to tell them, but no they are hard headed and the party ends up being us and a few close friends with nothing else to do. So the party was a drag. I tried to make the bestof things and enjoy the food, pool, and music though. I stuck with them cause they are my friends, but I'm still pissed that I threw away a potentially fun weekend.
