      Woke up this morning, still drunk. Got dressed and walked to the bus stop to go to work. Would have been perfectly normal but I went to the bus stop 3 hours earlier then I was sapost to. So I walked back home and the bus stop is like 8 blocks. Eventually I went to the bus stop at the right time. I had to chase after my dog who got off his leash somehow. I was working for a long time, lots of books. I hate work I never eat in the morning and form all the moving around I feel like I'm going to pass out by 5, and like an idiot I forget to bring $ for food. probably because I don't have any money! Never been paid yet! Went to the mall in my work cloths. Bought some cloths and changed into them. I helped Priya work. I made the sodas lol. Then told the guy that I was going to buy him a new rag with my first pay check. because they use the same rag that they clean the machines with to clean the counters where they make sandwiches lol. I said no wonder you got shut down twice. But my day yesterday was a lot more interesting then this one. I played roller coster tycoon 2 all morning. Did my Tao-Bo. And went to a house party at Ashley's house. Was fun a loot of people were there. I didn't want the stupid coors light so I had some gorge and orange juice, like 7 cups of it. Nick was there, he had a really funny hat and was trying to burn himself, because he's a psycho. I was soo drunk. One kid in perticular looked a lot like someone I knew (I think at least I'm not sure) but he was real cute. I was going to hook up with him, but things happen and I didn't. I unfortunately left early, my parents are so strict. Ashley didn't even show up to her own party. She did when it was almost over. I'm so going to have a house party when my parents leave!

      Okay, well I joined this thing because I'm sure it's a productive waste of my time. Also it's an Xanga that my friends can't see. My week was fine. Passed all my regents, I was very surprised. I went to my math teachers and thanked them personally for there support. I went to my chem teacher and told her she was the best. But whatever The years over. I'm going to miss school. Not the learning part, but my mediators and my other friends. I will miss all the seniors who I made friends with, thankfully most of them are in a 5 block radius from me, but congratulations to them! Sophmore year was definitely the best yet. I have done many inspiring things. Class visitations, conferences, speaking at CSI and the united nations. Can't wait till next year to do it all again. And I'll have acers (or how every you spell it), my scholarship and then I'll be up for the posse. Over the summer I wouldn't be doing anything at all. Just work. No vacation or anything. So I started writing a book. It has no specific story line, a bunch of things are going on in it. Infact too much goes on in a matter of 9 pages so I have to start adding stuff I don't want to. Ha, but I still have work. Being paid to be organized. Wish I was a computer page so I could do close to nothing, like Danny, pushing them chairs in lol. Today I was in jersey. When we were leaving Jersey and entering S.I it said "Welcome to Staten Island the borough of parks" Were the borough of parks? who would want to be the borough of parks. Why can't we be the borough of like no tax. Or something interesting. I say destroy all the parks and the greenbelt and put an amusement park there. One better then six flags. But only locals can go to. That's the good thing about Staten Island we never have tourists. But who would want to come here anyway? I'm off to Jens house with Patrice nothing, but with more people... byebye!

      I have a very strong belief that violence is completely pointless and unnecessary. Okay sure, there comes times in ones life where you have the urge to punch someone in the face so you did. But what did you accomplish exactly? Yes, you had your 10 second satisfaction and you have a laugh or two about it, but now you have an enemy an enemy for life and a bunch of other people (the persons friends) who also despise you, and you most likely don't even know them. Violence is ending no hate just making it worse. It is completely natural for a human to go strait towards competition when a need of thiers is not being meet (like animals) but people don't realize they have other choices. So as one of Wagners mediators I will share with you these choices ... your first choice and most obvious choice is to walk away. You probably walk away from problems on a daily basis for example someone accidentally walks into you, most likely you'll let it go and for get about it the next day, MOST people wouldn't start a fight for something so ridiculous, but sad to say there are people in the world who would. Walking away is used for minute problems things you would probably forget the next morning. Although walking away is a fair choice it has is cons like everything else in the world. If you are constantly made fun of and continue to walk away from this problem you could learn you hate yourself and when you hate yourself you could do something stupid like hurt yourself. another con is that if you are constantly frustrated and you continue to hold it all inside one day you could find yourself flipping out on someone who isn't even involved with the situation in which angered you. The last con and probably most obvious is that people will see you as an easy target. Fortunately you do have more choices. Your second choice is to confront the person and as a mediator I don't suggest it. Confronting the person is when you express yourself angrily which usually would lead into an argument maybe even an actual fight. Your last choice is to talk it out which is your best choice. Talking it out is different from confronting because when you talk it out your not only expressing your point of view your learning the other persons as well (your own little mediation). When you talk it out your usually able to work something out. 99% of the time talking it out works, mostly depending on how you say it. Another lesson lol, the way you speak to people about a problem either with an "I message" or a "you message". When people are angry and frustrated they usually use the "you message" which is placing all the blame on the other person and putting them in a defense mode. For example "You're so annoying. All you do is complain and you drive me crazy from it!" See now wouldn't you be mad if I were to speak to you like that? The other way the "I message" is placing the blame on yourself so the person your speaking to will listen and take an understanding "Listen (name), I sometimes feel that you complain a lot, and I would really appreciate it if you could please stop" wasn't that understanding? Well, I know I can only do so much to stop violence, I wish I could change the world but unfortunately I'm not the president (Not yet anyway). We need more presidents like Ronald regan! If anyone has a comment or something they'd like to ask regarding my feelings for nonviolence please do, I have so much more to say and things to teach but so little time!!  heres some strong statements that the mediators and I spoke when we were at the United Nations (The first paragraph was my statement)--  There is nothing more dangerous then to build a society with a large segment of people in that society who feel they have no steak in it, who feel they have nothing to loose. People who do have a steak in their society protect that society but when they don't they unconsciously want to destroy it. YOU CAN BE THE CHANGE YOU WISH TO SEE IN THE FUTURE, YOUR FUTURE (if one exists) depends on what you do in the present.   The weak can never forgive. The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort or convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.   AN EYE FOR AN EYE JUST MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD BLIND.

       Two close friends of mine who were dateing for a pretty long time are now engaged. I know there both 16 and it is a big jump. But they are crazy in love and I couldn't be happier for them. I also introduced them, so knowing that they are going to get married makes me feel like I did something right. He proposed like a month ago with a poem he wrote eight months soon to come yet we are still together everyday our  "relationship just keeps getting better i love you Amanda your the only  one for me we are happy together now let everybody see and  show everyone wat a great wife you would be i knew we were meant to be together from the start and nothing  in this world can tare us apart i wanna be with you for the  rest of my life so, Amanda Ismail will you please be my wife" Isn't that adorable. I wish someone would propose to me, or love me either is good.

      Ah! I was watching a T.V show, I'm not sure which but I'm too disgusted to care anyway. What happened was a little girl about 5 years old was raped. The people believed it was the step father but it was really her older brother, how fucking sick the older brother is about 9. To make it even more disgusting they knew that the child couldn't think of rape on his own that he had to learn it from someone. So again they blamed the step father. But while trying to get the little boy to admit to have raped the sister he didn't only admit it, he told them he was raped by his mother. HOW FUCKING SICK ARE PEOPLE. WHO WOULD RAPE THEIR FUCKING SON! Fortunately this isn't a true story, but I mean there is definitely somewhere in the world where this has happened. Okay yeah I hear about fathers rapeing daughter all the time, but that's because most men are sick pervs, but the mother???   Another thing that is also sick, in my opinion, are gays, mostly the male ones, lesbos aren't as nasty because they are usually ugly old woman, and the pretty ones are bi. But it is so nasty to see a man kissing another man, being affectionate with another man. This other T.V show I sometimes watch had a gay boy on his first date with another gay guy. I was screaming in laughter it was hysterical, this isn't fucking natural. If men were meant to fuck other men then there would be no more people. Adam didn't give away his rib for nothing! He gave it away for a companion, A FEMALE COMPANION. The bible clearly states in LEVITICUS 18:22 "And you must not lie down with a male the same way you lie down with a woman. It is a detestable thing." Your damn right it is! All I have to say to gay people is if you believe there is no God. For your sake you better be right!

      I woke up too early this morning I personally believe. Lauren was still over and I completely forgot she was there. I got a phone call from my sister at like 9 in the morning, we were sapost to hang out but I completely forgot. Lauren left then my sister came dropped off my nephew and went driving around waiting for me to get ready. My sister and my mother aren't on good terms, they dislike eachother and refuse to speak to one another because of stupid past bull shyt they just seriously need to let go of. When I finished me, my sister and her kids went to her house and I watched "Edward scissors hands" it was actually pretty good. I missed the best part though, I wish I saw what happened, if anyone saw that movie they should explain it to me! We ate pizza and my sister drove me off to work. She came in and signed her kids up for this summer reading thing and I'm glad she did. If the library gets a certain amount of kids to join we get out budget cut back or something like that. I started to work and very sadly did I learn one of the pages were leaving, don't get me wrong I barely know him but he's so nice I would have liked to continue working with him. My niece Gabby was jumping all over the library, was so funny she was climbing on the tables and pretty much anything she could get ontop of. I also received my first pay check today for $107. I guess that's okay I mean I was expecting more but now I understand why people hate working, barely any pay for so much damn work. Besides the fact that my entire paycheck went to my parents to pay for my sweet 16 I felt proud. Felt like I accomplished something, although I probably just messed up most of the books more... After all of that when work was over I took the bus home and chilled with my family for a little while, and then left to go to the mall. I despise the mall. I don't understand why my weekend must be spent there. I know Staten Island is dull and has no where really to go. But we would have so much more fun in my neighborhood as sapost to the mall. Well, either way I went for my friends birthday thing. Which was disturbing because she promised she wouldn't smoke for us, but she was high during. Pisses me off sometimes, sure I drink but once a month. This girl smokes every week to "Relieve stress." I wouldn't mind so much but I lost my best friend that way. I lost her and I miss her to death, she was so smart somewhat smarter then me but she would smoke sometimes to "relieve stress" (As if it even does relieve stress) and I would watch her day after day become into the person she is now. Now she cuts school like crazy, failed a majority of her classes and she lost 3 of her best friends because of her obsession with weed. What bothered me most was she had a future. As does my friend now, I'd never drink again for her to just stop. Weed relieves nothing it just pushes problems aside but they will always come back. Well, continuing I was mad at them for a little while because they went to party city without me and I wanted to go there because my friend works there and I could have got them free stuff and I specifically told them to wait for me but of course they didn't. I got over that in like 5 mins but then we went to appelbees to eat. It was a good meal I have to say but definitely not worth the money. I hate eating in places like that I paid more money then anyone else because assholes ordered drinks when they had no money and plus the 7 people or more tax! I paid $25 dollars which is almost literally my entire paycheck after paying my parents back. I was so angry. I always get stuck paying the most money. People who walk out when the bill comes are not friends they are jerks. I just must say I better get paid back. To top it all off my refrigerator broke and I'm in trouble for paying so much money for other people. I had to take out everything and put it all in the emergency refrigerator in the basement. We only had the fridge for a year and a half and it broke already. My family goes threw all sorts of problems. My oven broke on thanksgiving and my old fridge a week after. Before this fridge broke my brothers car got a flooded engine. My family has great luck lemme tell you, always bad things happening near eachother. I have much worse things I can say, but rather not. Also with a completely different topic. Something I did the other day that I'd also rather not say, the person it would effect most found out about it and she talked to me and was so nice about it. And then I clear the background in her profile to see this "stay away bytch.. u know who u r.. n dun tryn brake this love

      I was given plains without knowing. My friend told everyone that we were going to have a BBQ and a pool party at my house. Well, eventually I was told about this party at my house and I accepted. The morning was fun we watched a bootleg Shrek 2 which sucked because at the end with the good part it was being reluctant to play, Cheap bootleg. Priya came from work with Christine and brought us sandwiches soaked in mayonnaise... I hate mayonnaise filthy nasty food, fattening and just plain gross, It's not food! After all the eating we went swimming in my pool although it was windy. Noel showed up eventually (Christine's bf)  and we played volleyball. Noel and me against every one else. Me and Noel kicked ass and of corse we won. Since my mom wasn't sure if there was propane in the grill and all of us were to scared to try it we order pizza, dominos. Lots and lots of pizza and cheesy bread. Cheesy bread rules. When it got dark we all loaded on glow sticks and anything else that lite up or was red white and blue. We walked around my neborhood watching the pretty fireworks. I ran into Patricia, Jesse, Nikkei, Lauren, wailed, Danielle, Justin, Ashley, Nicole, Ilene etc. A lot of people were roaming the streets like myself. We then had the bright idea to make smokers so we walked to the store and bought the smore ingredients chocolate, graham crackers marshmallows, lighter. We made smores in my house and this time Joe followed us home. We played, or corse, eye toy (best game ever). Then went in the pool again. Everyone was trying to rape Joe, Don't know why. And Priya and Christine left and everyone else slept over (noel is gone too). Overall I think I had fun considering my friends are fun and a joy to be around sometimes. There was no drugs involved so I had reason to be happy. I hate watching my friends go to drugs for a means of comfort or relief, It's stupid and something I know they will regret one day. You don't need to smoke to have fun! You'd have more fun playing eye toy all day! EYE TOY. A BRITISH PS2 GAME. RECORDS YOUR MOVEMENTS FROM A CAMERA AND MAKES IT INTO A GAME. I RECOMMEND YOU BUY IT. IT'S LIKE $50. IT'S A GOOD WASTE OF TIME AND ALSO IS A LOT OF EXCERCISE. my personal favorite game with eye toy is when you hit the Chinese people. but u can be the judge of that.
