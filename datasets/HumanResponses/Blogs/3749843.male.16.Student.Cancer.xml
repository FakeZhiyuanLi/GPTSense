Okok.. no big deal. Now I'm sixteen years old, guess i have to be more responsible(I've always been a responsible good boy), more obedient, more hardworking, more ... ... Study harder and live life to the fulLest~!~ Thanks peny pwincess for the Bon Jovi cd. And I'm glad she didnt buy some other CD for me.(The case just cracked when I opened it. I don't know why, but i guess it has been left on the shelf for quite some time.. hhaha) Hmm.. I'm still waiting for SOMEMORE presents and also hong bao from my parents? Ten years down the road I will tel her what my wish was if my wish comes true la! Ten years down the road.. it's a long long... pass her my diary book as well..  .a  birthday with neither birthday cake nor red eggs .my wish better come true! Cos i made it at 12am sharp yt.™~

         i'm back.  about 1 more months to my prelim. one more week to my el olevel oral. less than 3months to my olevel. less than 5hours, and it will be the last day of July.       a basket has 8apples inside it. the apples are being shared equally among 8men, each man taking an apple. in the end, however, there is still one apple left in the basket. why?  life just sucks, without music. =/

        42days to prelim.  wow.    i think there's a chiobu in CCHY band. she was wearing the band uniform when i walked past her with her friend during recess. anyway, i don't think i have any feeling for girls. maybe even boys. haiz. my life is in a mess. i don't know my real sexuality.   i have always thought that i'm an ordinary boy, leading a happy life, a healthy life. things began to change when i grow older...   haiz. enough of my sorrow.   HIB came today. Gave us some gammar woksheet to do. Just a waste of time.     Couldn't concertrate and do the MYE El paper from WDL... Musical notes coming from the area outside the library were getting all my attention.. It has been almost...2 months since i last hear the band play... and i must say that they have indeed improved....    Enough for the day. Time to get my shower.

          Rain rain rain.the morning breeze was antiseptically cold against my face. i scanned the sky. no stars. just tiny droplets of rain falling down. what a nice day to start off with.   Went to the hall instead of the classroom for morning assembly. guess there's some important announcement for us to listen to or some other  important  stuff. true enough, we had community singing. "national day is coming yakyakyak let's practice some community singing.. yakyakyakya"    Come on, it's just some  singing.  singing of songs which we have sung for perhaps 4years already? there's no need for us to  practice  singing  them  isn't? haha. thank goodness first period was cme. we can afford to "eat" the time. Cme Pccg Poa Poa Mt Mt Recess Geog FT Amaths Geog.    Nothing much for Poa. topic was easy. limited companies.deferred shares.ordinary shares.perference shares... POOF "Well, we have covered the whole syllabus for your accounts..."    Mt lessons were free periods for us. used the time to finish up my Geog tourism mindmap. others, as usual, used the time for ..*ahem* (huàt là!)       Geog lessons were interesting. Interesting not because HIB made it interesting. We were asking each others lame questions throughout the whole lesson. haha. HIB had a sore throat. almost lost her voice? Just  hope  that she would be smart enough to take medical leave on hmm.. Thrusday. Then hopefully she would recover on Friday and go to school for national day celebration! Haha. Thoughtful. (actually i'm having a presentation on thrusday. so if she's not in school on thrusday, then.. *evil smile*) Amaths was.. erm..  able-to-understand  the chapter relative velocity. Just a couple of practices and i think i should be able to understand the chapter well.    PCCG. taught us how to ah.. couldn't really remember what the lesson was about. "Worry time: Spend about 15 to 30minutes to worry about.. anything you wanna worry about. Studies, life etc. Then you will find that the worries will not be bugging you therfore, you would be able to concertrate/focus more while doing homework or revising for exams." Aha. another one was about "Be here now." If your mind starts to wander off when you are doing homework or revising, then tell yourself "Be here now." Try it. You will find that blah blah blah blah..   Finished my Poa homework one the bus. What a great achievement! *A pat on my back please. =D       Time to do my homework. Let's hope it  rains  again tomorrow morning.   yt™
