      It was only warm, but muggy.  Of course it was 20 degrees hotter on the stage we were on than anywhere else.  Of course, no one had even the vaguest idea of which stage we were supposed to go to or where it was.  (not just band members.... FAIR STAFF).  Of course the first thing i did upon arrival and unloading was SMASH THE SHIT out of one of my fretting fingers.  Of course that still hurts like a mofo.  Um and we were pretty damn good i gotta say.   Oh and clickie clickie on my profile over by the contributors thingay, cos there's a really freakin rad picture of me there.  I mean, pictures of me this good roll around once a century.  Damn i look good.

      A dozen years or so of cultural flimflam passed me right by.  I sometimes feel like Death must have when he went for a visit. I don't relate with most pop culture unless it has something to do with music.   Speaking of Death.... there's something very strange about Death being a virgin.   You can call me... RumpelPRILskin.

      ok.  Blastin the Posies and the Toadies for a shot of "aaarrgh" for this afternoon.  Got Xtra Super Strong coffee on (and steaming down my gullet).  Preparations for fried egg sammiches on toast, with toast on the side, are underway.  I have my clothes laid out.  My hair is a fine  scarlet.   I got some sleep.  Bass is ready to go.  Tuner:  Check.  Drums  are  ready to go.  Amp is not yet unplugged.   I'm not nearly half this freakish when we play.  I have no idea why this one-hour show at the county fair has me all wound up.   but   I'm Ready To Rock.

      /me looks at you with a cocked eyebrow, twirling her coffee cup in her hand.  Yes my dear Pril, it was almost a ... "spiritual experience".    I think that cup twirling is kind of like signing the cross right?

      four... count 'em.. four (um give or take a few minutes) glorious hours of *TLAVK.    The last bit of Thunderheart, all of Red Planet, and almost all of Tombstone (again).     I really don't understand the Wyrdlings' attraction to that Cro-Magnon, Vin Diesel. She must have dropped them on their heads when they were babies or something.        *The Always Luscious Val Kilmer

      Then I stuck my finger in my eye.  Oh, it's not just selling THINGS or YOURSELF.  It's not mere politics.  It's RELIGION BABY.  My religion requires FAITH and HOPE.  And lots and lots of EYE LINER.  It's fun though.  Is religion supposed to be fun?  Am I doing something WRONG HERE?

      Yesterday I was subjected to propaganda.  How To Sell Crap type propaganda.  Or, it could have been any speech by any politician.  Any idiot on the phone who i did not ask to call me.   There are proven methods to selling your stuff, your ideas, your platform, your self.  They are interchangeable.  You consider yourself a savvy shopper? Look what else you're buying.  Look what other slop you're happily eating.  You bought it.  It's crap.  You like it anyway.  You like it because it's cool to like it.  It doesn't matter if it tastes like cardboard and looks like reconstituted bloodmeal worms, everyone else says it's good so you eat it.  You pishpaw the peer pressure and your peers are all drinking the same lukewarm swill as you.  You can never escape it, and you will never escape it.  "Better than them" is an addiction and you're the hype.   We will always be around to sell you things you don't need, and we can always convince you to buy them because you NEED them.  Everyone else does, and if they aren't buying it too, they just don't know any better.

      I'm talking about YOU.  With the out of state plates.  Driving your house around.      You may have noticed as you entered the state, BIG GREEN SIGNS that say you are to stay in the right lane unless you're passing.  Ignore this at your peril.  You make me pass on the right, I'll dig around behind my seat and find something, some slimy thing or some big thing, and throw it at YOUR LAME ASS as I speed past you.      Thank you.

      I was never really a drooling Bratt Pitt fan, but i gotta say, "Meet Joe Black" might have turned me into one.      I think perhaps *TALVK would have suited the part well, too.            *The Always Luscious Val Kilmer

        About a week ago a kid with liberty spikes and a dead kennedys shirt asked where i got my hair color.  He about fainted when i told him Wal-Mart.  I guess he went and told all his friends, cos now there's an  awful lot  of kids around town with the Fuschia Flash hair.      Time for something different for me i guess.  Yeesh.

      Ok well it's been like a month since Nth of Pril went down the tubes.  In the meantime, i've been entertaining myself til it hurts.         Tam and i have spent a total of about 12 hours in the luxury yacht. (that's canoe to you city folks).  It shows.           I missed the cardboard boat races.  Was just too lazy to go outside.           It got warmish here. Some might say hot, but the worst part wasn't the hot, it was the humid.  Then we got slapped with hurricane force winds.  Typical.           Tam and I invented and worked on a setlist for our new project, T&A Productions Co, Inc, LLC, Etc.  A veritable entertainment conglomerate. You'll see.           The Wyrd one and I have plotted and schemed, but the world is still not our oyster.  Don't worry, you'll soon be on the BBQ, floating in butter-garlic-tobasco-parmesan sauce.              Greatest garage sale find in years...   "Asterix bei der Schweizen" .  For a dollah! For Dale and I, reading this is like being five years old and being given a big book full of big words.  We both excelled at German in high school, but having not used it regularly in a good 10 years or so, even a basic comic book is a slog.  Good stuff, though.

       It's really just too bad they can't decriminalize pot for the months leading up to the election.      1. Stunts gag reflexes, making it possible to vote without vomiting all over the booth.    2. Feeling of well-being, to offset the feeling that no matter who you vote for, you're just screwed.  3. Removes any bits of guilt that might be left over after voting with your concience instead of your party.   4. Makes you hungry, and able to order "Potatoes prepared in the Belgian manner" with a straight face.

      oh did i mention yet that i watched part of the DNC on the tee-vee tonight? It was all "blah blah blah John Kerry blah blah". Just like that Far Side cartoon about what you say to your dog vs. what your dog hears.      Of course, i'm sure the RNC will be similar, except it'll be "Blah blah blah George Bush blah blah".      And all the people will look, or did look, like they are expectantly waiting for the sacred Kool-Aid.      My questions:   Will Jesse Jackson ever learn how to speak?  Will Hillary ever speak in a manner less than completely condescending?   What's with the goofy hats?

      Not too long ago my little spot, Nth of Pril, simply disappeared.  It was slightly more complicated than that, but that's all anyone needs to know.      So this weirdo i know, she and i cooked up this plan for this thing you're staring at.  There may or may not be the old usually incoherent rants emanating from this little corner of the round room.  It depends on how busted we get for mentioning one of the myriad ways we manage to avoid time clocks, dress codes, middle management, service industries,  lunch breaks, 10 minute rest breaks, bosses staring over our shoulders, piss tests and people screaming about deadlines.  Yeah, you know, at some point, you just look at that crap and go, "Screw this".      That'd be my introduction. Or, reintroduction, as the case may be.   But wait! There's more! I also play bass in  urlLink this band .  And I spend a lot of time typing, mostly off line.

      I say we give it a week for those nasty adds to drop after making the necessary change.  And i will say this- i hope an order never arrives as early on a gig weekend as this one did, again.  three-and-a-half hours is simply not enough shut-eye to get you through a day like today was.  It was total psycho-nightmare day with three trips to town for me (and back!) , the loading of band stuff, the unloading of band stuff, etc.   My partner in crime of course broke the cardinal rule for gig weekends.   If you know i am playing, you call before noon at your own risk.    Most people would just ignore the ringing phone.  I can't.  So of course it's partially MY FAULT for answering the phone anyway.   I'm surprised i was coherent at all while on the phone.  seagypsy queen: The order is here! seagypsy court jester: It's 8 AM! Aren't the hamsters  supposed to drive the enzo to Paso Robles in two weeks? seagypsy queen: (going along with it, in order to mess with me later) Sure! Yeah! They're leaving in 10 minutes. seagypsy court jester: Great! I'll bring the gas station vitamins over for breakfast tonight.  Laters.

      It's been a busy campaign.  Last campaign I quit counting at 8 new customers.  My goal was 10.  I also signed a rep.  Pril has been busy too.  We managed to do some things together and collapse briefly on my porch.  This time I have a completely insane goal list.  Ten new customers, 2 new reps, 1k sales.  So far, one day in, I have 2 new reps and one new customer.  EEEEEEEEEEEE!!  Our big meeting is Friday.  Pril will be with me helping DM set up.   Then she's playing at the Oasis in Reedsport that night.  I  had to call some of the other AVON ladies in town to let them know they had rescheduled the meeting.  They kept saying, I was at the last meeting which one were you?  So I used Pril as a reference point.  I was by the one with the pink hair.  They go ooooooh, you see, because they remember HER but not ME.  Hmmph!  I have half a mind to kick her  little pink haired butt  tomorrow.  I don't care HOW cute her shoes are.

      well isnt that the most disgusting irony.  The only ads i ever see in the adbox are for the  pink people.     Only one thing needs to be said... AVON has over a hundred shades of lipstick.  The  pink people  do not.  Can you buy toys through the  pink people ? NOOOoooOOOO.  Can you buy diecast models of Elvis' favorite cars from the  pink people ?! NoOoOoO.  Can you buy 1:24 diecast classic Harleys? NASCAR slippers? Popeye watches? NOOOOO! Do the  pink people  have things for dudes? Of course not.   Would you rather aim for oooh... one of three cars chosen by the company of  pink people , or would you rather aim for... an $800/month car allowance?  With which you can buy..  pretty much whatever freakin car you please!    I rest my case!

      Went and hung out with my beauty parlor friend.  I gave her pretty stuff and she trimmed my hair for free.  I told her she could sell for me if it behooved her.  You could tell she was thinking about it but then she says, no, you get to do it.  So I have my own lovely shelf and managed to hand out a few brochures to customers who asked for them.  She put neat stuff in my hair.  I'm goin to her reception Sunday, a party of course.  A girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.

      As i await the arrival of one of my custies to collect her order, i'm sitting with my bass and engaging in some eye-candy watching.  Saw 12 monkeys last night. Rather frustrating ending. I was all up in arms about it. A Terry Gilliam movie, so of course it was totally weird.  The local video store does not have True Romance. I was disappointed. Even more disappointed that the hipster at the counter, Mr. Tarantino fan, had no idea it existed, and was looking in the Romance section for it. I'm all.. Dude... i'm pretty sure its not a romance, it being by Tarantino and all. I must see the movie though, because i have not yet.  Recently someone said they weren't into things like the  pink lady parties  and AVON parties. Au contraire, mon sorore! (Um yeah i suck at french!). MY AVON parties would be.. orgies of tasty beer (as opposed to swill), the slathering of many lotions and pampering of tootsies, with some nice looking dude with a perty mouth on the Tee-Vee. Wait a sec. That's what my mom's product parties are like, and she's a Passion Party consultant.  Well, so mote it be... i'm a 21st century AVON lady after all.

      You think George Bush is evil? You maybe think John Kerry is evil?  You're wrong. WRONG WRONG WRONG.   I know evil.  She's my AVON upline, and the other contributor.  Never have i met a woman so deserving of my admiration in the manipulative arts.  I love a girl with a gun in her hand and a party on her mind.

      well, not really.  Just dusting off the furniture at the  urlLink old place  and there you can once again experience the pril who is not acting.  Because, yes, i am an  AVON INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVE (!!), it's like... a part. And i'm in a movie, see. Like the whole rock star thing- that's another part. And also the good wife... another character role.

       Ms Exec. Leader Upline person called today and relayed the following info:    Item #1:  When advertising,  ANYTHING , paper, sign, window decal, one must always put AVON Independent Sales Rep. Always.  Item #2:  One can sell in one's own business, flea market table, etc., but not in another's business. She herself has been setting up at local flea markets.   Item #3:  Very happy we have circled all the bases with our wagons, in our AVON takeover of the planet. Mostest happiest because we were the bestest girls to our DM.  Pril, tomorrow scares me. Be my clone and take the kids to the dentist for me?

      I'm a rooster.  I can't help it. I was born in the year of the Rooster.  I tend more toward the masculine descriptions of Roosters than the feminine, too. I only say this because i keep opening up the picture of me thats on my profile and cackling with glee at it because i like it so much.  You could call this being an egotist or something similar, and you'd probably be right.  But hey, when you go through 34 years with only probably one really great picture of you once every three years, (although i think this year i've had two...) you really dig it when there's a good one.  Some lucky jerks are so photogenic that nearly every shot of them is fantastic.  They will never know the feeling of "Good Lord, i had no idea i was so good looking.  Must be the light or something. "  I can't stop looking at myself.  It's insane.   When i was about 4 my mom took me to Sears for some portraits.  Gramma was with us.  Gramma was appalled because i was dirty.  Typically dirty, for me. I was a filthy little child.  So there was this series of pictures taken of me, with my always bad hair and some smears of dirt under my nose.  My mom likes to say, "It's you.  You weren't a clean kid, and we could never keep you clean.  You were happiest in mud. If you had been clean in the picture, it wouldn't have properly reflected you at that time."    And so i will leave you with this, seen on a sign around town:   "Be yourself" is bad advice to give some people.

      Another case i remember being bombarded with when i was growing up, this one while i was in middle school.  The Laurel Canyon murders as they were known at the time, The Wonderland murders as they seem to have morphed into.  I was about 11... i had no idea who John Holmes was, y'know? "Adult film star" didn't have much meaning, either.   I watched Wonderland last night.  Ok i rented it cos it's a Val Kilmer movie! So kill me.  But it was trippy.  He did a good job as a lying, sniveling piece of shit basefiend.  And i've known enough of them in my time to know exactly what sort of subhumans they are.  Which brings an interesting thing up.  At times in the movie, you feel profoundly sorry for the Holmes character.  I mean, you go, "jeez, dude, if you could only see yourself".  Other times, you wonder how someone like that managed to stay alive long enough to be such a sheister.  You could kill him yourself for showing his weasely face.   So now i have a little more understanding of that particular LA murder case, and the Onion Field one.  I have no real desire to learn anything more about the OJ one.   My homesickness seems to manifest itself by the need to watch movies filmed in or about Los Angeles and the psychos, freaks and weirdness that have inhabited its landscape for the past 100 years.   Someday, i'll get back there.  Til then i continue my love/hate relationship with it from Oregon.
