      So today started off pretty crazy.  I went from my house to Mystic.   First a guy walks in front of my car not even looking that I almost ran his ass over... second, while I'm waiting for the light to turn red, this guy takes a left hand turn into my line.  I'm thinking "He's going to hit me..."  and finally he looked up and seen it was a one way road... after that I was on the highway going towards Mystic and there was this guy on a bike [not a motorcycle] trying to cross the five line highway!   That was crazy!  Work was just another boreing slow day...  so to make a long story short here...  I was at my bosses party, got thrown into the water,  so did everyone else who worked at the shelter did... fully clothed... lets call this call "Antcy",  she took off all her clothes and jumped into the water butt ass naked, and I got to see something I didn't really want to see... *shivers*  Finally I was coming back home on Rt. 32, and there was a sobriety test going on... I did have some crap to drink, but that was almost two hours before I got onto the road... so here I am, soaking wet, smelling like pool water, my eyes are burning red from being wet and having water in them... the cop comes up to me... "You've been drinking?"  I reply "Yes, a few hours ago..."  The he asked if I had any weed in the car, I said no... he's like "Will you let me bring my dog into your car to search it..."  I told him SURE!  Since I have nothing on me anyway...  Finally he lets me go... I get to the end, there's these people doing a servy on how well these police are doing...  so they make me do a breathalizer test and write down where I was coming from to where I was going, etc...  then let me go.  Talk about a crazy day....  I just want to be dry and go to sleep.

      Today something happened that most people don't usually have to deal with...  brb phone call. :)  That was "island girl", people who know me know whom I'm talking about.  So anywho, when I pull up to my job, there's " FREE THE ANIMALS!! "   spay painted in bright green on out white fence out front.  I couldn't believe my eyes!  I sat outside today with "Oops" trying to get the paint off, but only to make it worse by smaring it all over. *sigh*  On of our dogs were about to go home today, we can call her "Candi", I told the co-worker no women... so of course she was going to be placed with a women and man...  brb phone...  It seems like I'm always being called to do this, or do that or run here, or pick this up, get that for someone...  I'm really getting sick of doing shit for everyone, but at the same time I am getting more depressed by not going out, not having someone there for me at night, etc.  I think that could be one of the main reasons why I'm so grumpy all the time.  I just need someone I can share my life with, good and bad...  is that to much to ask?  Oh yeah... not to jump around here with my stories, but you know...  someone called me with a 14 year old and a 2 year old cat... "Take these cats or I'm going to shoot them..." this guy with a very deep stern voice says...  I asked him why he doesn't want them. "I'm getting divorced and my daughter moved in with her mother... takes these cats."  That's when everyone was coming inside after one of our dogs got adopted... brb phone...  It's like when I get home my phone rings non stop...  I've had these three calls plus a few others.  To make a long story short, my day was stressed out, plus my friend is coming to pick me up so he can get a keg... fun fun...

      Something I wrote a little while ago.  Yet again my dear friends, another year has passed... From new to old, to old to new... This year has gone way to soon... The things I've learned and the things I've done... I shall apply them in the years to come... What I'm saying, isn't much... But live your life to the touch.

      Another day of going out with my friends and doing nothing...  There's really nothing going on other then the CHS getting new uniforms which are pretty nice looking. We look more like lawyers now. :)  Another day in the life of me...  a dog came back that we've had for a long time, she was a very nice hound...  It was a tough day at the shelter for myself.   I feel like sometimes I'm the only person there who does anything.   I know I'm told I always bitch, but at least I do my work while I'm bitching.  I'm just going to find a school that teaches zoology, and start working at the zoo we have in Connecticut...

      I'm really confused on what the hell's going on... um... I just want to post but now it's sent me to this whole thing I've just setup... I guess I have a thingy to write in now?  Just wanted to post something. ^_^   While I'm here I just wanted to say that I've heard some crazy shit on the radio... it was a commerical saying that the local hospitols and medical centers are getting "Ready" and "prepared" for BIO/Chem war crap...  it sort of freaked me out...  Think about it, it's on the radio saying "You have airbags,  you wear a seatbelt... but when it comes to personal health... bla bla bla...  I was like what the hell's going on...  Then after that a commerical for the US Navy came on saying how "You can change your future, see the world..."  It's war time in the USofA... Hm...
