      Sucha FReakISH thing happened to me yesterday!  &nbsp; Yesterday at night, my mom wanted to withdrawl some money from her credit card and asked me to help her. So she drove to find a place that would have a ATM machine. Assuming that BANK OF AMERICA main office building has one, my mom just dropped me off by the side road at NIGHT.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got out of the car and ran to the building. When I got there, I looked for the ATM machine. But the building was so huge~ and it had like 4 different entrances so I didn't know which door it was by..so I walked around and couldnt find it~ so I looked inside the building...it was all dark but I can see that there were another doors inside the building. SO I thought hmm maybe this building has ATM machines INSIDE the building. So I checked the door if it was open or not. AND IT WAS OPEN!!! so I went inside.  &nbsp; And as soon as I went inside, I saw a broken elevator keep ringing and some blinkings from the security guard desk. It was really really freaky!! I was so scared! but I still looked for the machine. But I found that the atm machine was actually right OuTSIDE of the OTHER DOOR~ So I went back and pulled the door to open again....but it wouldn't... OPEN!!!! I checked all the entrances and it was all LOCKED!! So there I was late at night inside the BANK OF AMERICA building with frikin broken elevator and blinking buttons everywhere on the security desk. I thought I was going to be TRAPPED there for the WHOLE NIGHT!!! I was so freaked out after I found out all the doors were locked!! I called out for help and security guard. I ran around like crazy looking for way out!  > AND I even tried to use some buttons on security desk... -,-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was desperate okay? ^^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I was about to give up and then I saw this door at the end of the hall. So I pushed it and it OPENED!! yay! so I got out~  &nbsp; I was at the back of the building by the dumpsters~ So I ran out and ran around the WHOLE building and came back to the 4 original entrances. And then I found the ATM Machine after all the troubles~ and got my mom's money.  &nbsp; But after I was done, I was curious if the door would open again...so I went to the same entrance I opened before and tried to open it again....but you know what? IT WOULDN"T OPEN this TIME!!!! I was sooo FREAKED afterwards!!! Why did it open before and not NOW?? &nbsp; *whew* I am glad that I am over now But it was just so weird and freakish~ and through this I learned my lesson......... I am never gonna go to the bank at night! EVER! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My mom's comment after I came back......" what took you so long? " -,-
