      Can't sleep, so I figured you'd all like this.  urlLink    Beauty and danger all wrapped up in one. Calm and gentle on the outside, ferocious and terrifying on the inside. Isn't our nature to flirt with danger? Aren't we draw to it? Well, like it or not, that's human nature. Good girls go for bad guys. Bad guys make good girls into hurt ones. Good boys try to help hurt girls. Hurt girls make good guys into bad ones. Thus, the cycle begins anew. How does it end? When someone breaks the cycle. I broke the cycle. I may not be completly intact, but at least I got it to stop. To some extent, I even reversed it.  I only hope that others can do the same.  Perhaps that will make the world a better place.  Maybe even make some of us feel like we're wanted, even loved.  I sure hope so.

      So I'm sitting here, at my computer, and I think to myself, "Self, what is up with ilovebees.com?" Well, I know it's some sort of brilliant marketing scheme by Bungie, but what's going to happen when the countdown is done? I'm not that overly concerned about it, but just overly curious.  As I count down the day towards the biggest day in the video game industry, I can't help but devour every little table scrap Bungie drops on the floor. I'm not going to lie. I can't wait for Halo 2 to come out. I will probably forsake my family, food, and even my girlfriend (sorry) for a few days just to play it. I'd skip work, but I'm too damn responsible to do something like that. Plus, it's just a game.  Still, what's going to happen on August 24, 2004 at 6:00 am EST? Well, the countdown will stop and all will be revealed....NOT. As much as I want to have a playable demo release on that day, it just won't happen. Alas, Halo 2 will own me until it finally releases. I just have to keep reminding myself that it's just a game and there are more important things in my life that it.  Speaking of which, I can't wait to see my girlfriend. We've been through a lot together. I haven't seen her in almost a week. Oh no, my world is ending (Laughing). But seriously, I do miss her and want to see her again. Things between us have gotten a lot better. It's unfortunate that things had to happen they way they did. She and I have regained the love we lost for each other. I just wish that I would have happened without causing one of my best friends pain. Cest la vi.  Well, I'm off to clean my room and launch some warthogs (insert evil grin). But before I go, let me leave you with this.    urlLink

      Well, I'd like to start out saying that I hope I can keep this as a constant thing. Posting that is. Many things hold intrest with me for a while and then fade.  You know, looking back at my life, hindsight really is 20/20. So many things have happened to bring me to this point in time. School, family, relationships, work, and friends. Life is the sum of the choices we make. I've made some good ones. I've made some bad ones. We all have. It's how we deal with the choices and consequences of our actions that make up who we are.  Sorry, started to ramble. Anyway, my point is we can't go back and change the past. We'd all  like to , but it just won't happen. You've got to stay focused on who you  really  are through everything. Sometimes we lose focus on that.  Oops. I guess I'm still rambling. On to something else. Tomorrow is inventory. I  hate  doing inventory. I never get out of it, nor will I ever. See, as the Assistant Manager, I   MUST   be there   for every inventory. It just takes so long to do, and there's only three of us doing it....while we're open. I really wanted to go to my cousin's baptism tomorrow, but  noooo  guess where I'll be.  Well, that's enough for now...I think. Hope to keep this up.  -Peace
