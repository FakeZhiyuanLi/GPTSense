       The Winner of the hypocrite award is   Amazon.com.  Yes, the so-called "best marketplace"      Check this link out:   urlLink http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00019PDNY/002-6306222-8387214?v=glance       While these assholes  think they are "proper" by censoring the show's name:  Penn and Teller: Bullshit!  By the way, this is a great show.     CHECK THE PICTURE NEXT TO THE ITEM OUT.  It says BULLSHIT.  So they censor the header, but not the picture... Why?  So people buy the product.  Capitalism.  Now, I'm against all censorship, and I'm also against being a hypocrite.

       Ok, before I get emails from wrestling fans bitching about how I'm "dissing" their beloved sport, let me tell you that I like or liked wrestling until recently.  The WWE sucks.  All the good and entertaining superstars are gone.  The Rock, Mankind, Stone Cold etc...  And the superstars that are still there like Triple H and the Undertaker are boring now.  Characters keep changing and the twists are expected.  Plus, wrestling is not as abrasive or in-your-face as it was in the past.  The tag teams suck, and it is just boring.  Plus, they have a split:  Smackdown and Raw.  This is bullshit, because each show has about 25 wrestlers and how can they fit them all on one show?  It's a crappy system.  I still watch it from time to time, but it is not interesting anymore.  Vince Macmahon is a bitch for playing into "the parents."  The WWE is actually trying to get parents involved and having teens vote.  STOP THIS POLITCALLY CORRECT BULLSHIT.  It's wrestling not some show on the Disney Channel.

        Well I just finished reading  Madame Bovary  by Gustave Flaubert. This book is dreadful. All it talks about is about a powerless woman who wants to leave her boring husband and live a life full of romance, passion, and sex. She has Multiple affairs and buys expensive shit until she and her husband are broke. After she realizes her lovers never loved her and she ruined her life, she poisons herself. Then later on, her husband dies. The child they had together ends up working in a cotton mill. Well, there you have it...the French always have to over-dramatize and make life seem empty and shallow. The plot sucks. If I the writer, I would just have Emma (the powerless woman) start whipping her tits out and get attention, instead of sneaking around like a two-cent slut. I know it is set in times where women had to be "pleasant" but come on...it's France. France is the fucking capital of the world. People go to France to fuck. What else? Admire a crappy metal tower that looks like a crappy wire? Anyhow...French literature sucks. If you want to write a book and you are French, don't.

        Today's music sucks. That's the reality. While you washed out teenie-boppers don't admit it, you have to know (somewhere in your brainwashed brains) that Britney Spears and artists like her SUCK. How do you tell? (and by you I mean I, cause you can't tell, cause you buy her crappy one good-bad song albums) Anytime you have to resort to kissing Madonna, marrying a guy with two black children, marrying a guy for 24 hours, and having a "beef" with another fake artist (avril lavigne) your time as a credible artist is up. Whatever happened to good music? Why don't "artists" really sing instead of lip-syncing to songs that they didn't write. Screw them and their million dollar mansions. And screw people who bought that shit. I mean really, why would anybody buy a Britney CD that has one good song (and that song isn't good, it's just either catchy or overplayed until it gets stuck in your head)? I don't know, it all sucks.

        The Failures of religion: Part I     a) hate: Religion, though against hate, has inspired hate and division for centuries. A few historical events: crusades, inquisition, holocaust, bombings in mideast, September 11, and there is more. b) hypocritical: religion is very contradictory, especially Christianity. Christians supposedly believe in tolerance, yet they oppose gays. The Bible says "thall shall not kill" yet there were and are many wars going on. Jesus preached forgiveness, yet nobody forgives anybody. Who forgave Clinton for getting blown? It is still an issue. Clinton, if you're reading this, which i doubt cause I'm not getting many hits, I FORGIVE YOU. MOVE ON   c) impractical. Religion does not fit in today's world. I'm not against believing in god, I'm against wasting your money on corrupt, child-molesting priests, and on a system that is old-fahsioned and political. d) censorhsip: this one pisses me off the most. All these self-righteous religious groups are preaching about morality and decency. If you want decency: FUCK OFF. Take some responsibility and teach your kids. Howard Stern is not to blame if your kid is fucked up: YOU ARE. And Janet Jackson's tit slip was blown out of proportion. I mean you see tits in biology books. What's the big deal? ALL CENSORSHIP IS WRONG      In conclusion: all you religious INTOLERANT groups out there can kiss my "immoral" ass. It is up to US to choose OUR path in life, not yours. so fuck off.

        Don't you hate it when people talk shit about what you like unjustifiably? Me too. I know I talk shit against Britney Spears and other pop artists, but I have reason. I'm not making shit up. She is talentess. Period. Anyway, back to the discussion. My classmates at school, who call themselves "metalheads" (how lame) say that Nu-metal sucks, and that only bands who are "underground or unkown" are good. This is bullshit. I don't care if you like pop or metal or rap, the point is: if it's good, stop talking shit.

        Well, as you all probably know, the RIAA has been set (since Napster) to bring down file sharing. They claim that the reason their record sales are plummeting is because of people who share files. This is complete and utter bullshit. People are not buying records because they don't want to waste their 20 bucks on a piece of crap over-produced, spiritless piece of crap album. If these assholes want to sue somebody, let them sue themselves for being money-hungry crapheads. Yes I said crapheads. If they want better record sales, they should lower the price of thier records to 10 bucks, at least. They say "file sharers are cheating artists" and that they are "looking out for them." What a complete crock of shit. If by paying artists 2% of record sales is "looking out for them" then they are artists' guardian angels. But this is not about the artists, this is about our rights. If I want to download a over-produced played out song from Kazaa, I should have the right to. But why are they against it. This is why: read carefully!!          remember the age of tapes. That was the stone age right. But weren't people "recording" music then. Yes. Everyone I knew, were recording from the radio onto their tapes. Did the RIAA complain? hell no! Why? because each tape purchase gave them money. In other words, each time I buy a tape, the record industry gets a certain percentage of the money. They were happy, indeed. Now that, mp3's are unprofitable for them, they are pissed off. It's not about artists' "rights" it's about money, filthy money. Money over music!! And these morons have the audacity to sue little girls who download britney spears songs. (those girls should be sued for listening to britney spears period) Point is, if you buttholes continue to make crappy music, we won't buy it, and we will always share, thats what we were taught since birth.           let me recommend some good file-sharing programs:       winmx:  urlLink http://www.winmx.com
