						   Today, I did absolutely nothing. I didn't feel particularily guilty about that either. I felt shitty all day and I wished that I hadn't even gotten out of bed for most of it. I haven't even gotten any real gaming in today.    I did find an interesting picture though.       I'm not an American, so my opinion of the presidential candidates is hardly relevant, but this gives me a giggle anyway.

						   I worked for several hours on the yard today.  The back yard was much easier than I thought it would be, so I spent more time in the front yard than I had originally intended.  I pulled up every weed, whacked down every tall blade of grass, and even tilled the soil in the garden by hand so that we can plant some attractive plants there once we have money.  It was dirty, sweaty work, and my hands and back are still sore hours later, but it was worth it.  The yard looks great.    There is still work to be done out there, but the appearance has changed enough that I don't need to worry about complaints anymore.  It's my own green thumb that will keep me occupied now, rather than the bitchery of others.  I actually want to get some stuff growing out front as soon as I can.  I haven't done any gardening in more than a decade, and I guess I missed it more than I thought.  There are a couple of plants out there now that I didn't want to pull up because they were obviously "garden" plants and not weeds, but they're kind of ugly.  I'll probably wind up pulling them this weekend.    I splurged and bought myself dinner from a restaurant to reward myself for all the hard work.  I also managed to sit down and play a couple of hours worth of video games as well.  All in all, this was a pretty good day off.

						   The yard is coming along nicely.  I've managed to trim most of the back yard down - only one corner remains overgrown.  I still need to rake everything up, but that really won't take me all that long.  There are some bare patches in the back yard that need to be fixed, but that's something I'll have to take care of over time.    The front yard is my first project for tomorrow.  It'll probably only take an hour or so, so I'm not very concerned about it.  Nevertheless, I'd like to get it out of the way.  The remainder of the back yard can be done either tomorrow afternoon or on Thursday.    I've noticed that my temper is very short lately.  Perhaps it has always been that way and I'm only just noticing, I don't know.  In any case, I've been getting very angry very easily of late, and I'm not sure it's a bad thing.  I'm much more inclined to voice my opinion when I'm angry, and I don't become a frothing beast like some people do when angered - I remain articulate, but I gain in volume and diminish in tact.  I become very direct.  It's a good thing.

						   I spent a solid hour in the backyard.  It does look a little better, but I've come to the conclusion that I'm going to need to roto-till and replant to make it look any good.  Still, it was good to get outside and do something rather than sit on my ass.  I also cleaned up the kitchen completely, which was even easier than I thought it would be.  The front yard should be pretty easy - I'll do that tomorrow night after work.

						   If a man's home is representative of his mental state, I must be a total wreck.  It's unbelievable how messy I've allowed my home to become, both indoors and out.  One of my first steps in bettering myself must be to improve the appearance of my home.  If I'm in an environment that is always in shambles, how can I expect to exert order and control over my life?    The first thing is to get the kitchen completely cleaned up.  This is probably the easiest task, and will only take me an hour or so to complete.  All I really need to do is one load of dishes, though I do need to fix the kitchen sink by replacing a washer in the cold water faucet as well - something that will have to wait until I can get to a hardware store, unfortunately.    The next step, and probably most important one at this point, is to clean up the front and back yards of the condo.  I don't have the equipment to do this though, so I'm going to need to convince my brother to bring the stuff over from my parents' place.  I need to get rid of all of the weeds in the garden out front, aquire a working sprinkler to attempt reviving the grass, and possibly lay some soil so that I can plant some flowers.  The grass hasn't grown enough to require an earnest clipping, but a weedwacking would do the edges some good.  The back yard is another story though.  I'm going to need to shovel up some dog shit, and the weedwacker probably won't be enough to take down the jungle weeds I've got growing back there.  It's going to be several hours of work - I've already set aside my Wednesday off to take care of it, but I'm not certaint that it will be enough.  I've got to get at least the front yard done by August 1st, according to a letter I received from the condo corporation.  It still really chaps my Libertarian hide that they even have the right to require such a thing, but I do agree that the yard is out of hand.    Once all of that is done, I need to start working on the bedrooms.  My own room is a sty, but that is mostly thanks to my wife.  Her clothing is spread all across her half of the room, and there's a stack of used kleenex on her side of the headboard.  I found myself thoroughly dismayed when I returned to the room in that kind of state after my vacation.  One of the spare rooms needs a fresh coat of paint and a solid carpet cleaning, as well as having all of a previous tenant's belongings emptied from it.  This is probably another day-long project, and I don't know when I'll be able to get to it - probably not until next week.    I'm going to start picking away at the back yard immediately.  I don't have the tools right now, but I can still shovel up the dog shit and try to clear away some of the debris that has accumulated back there.  It's not going to be fun, but it has to be done.

						   I've been a blogger for years now.  I started on  urlLink Xanga  way back in the Bianca Broussard days (circa 2001).  I enjoyed it a great deal, as it was basically what I was trying to do with my old website at the time - just a personal journal where I could put down my thoughts.  I introduced my wife to the site as well, and we both kept blogs there for quite some time.    My wife eventually introduced some of her friends and our coworkers to the site.  Many of them started blogging as well.  We had our own little ad-hoc blogger community, and for a time it was good.  There were perhaps one or two dozen people in the Xanga community who we knew outside of the web.  We all traded comments and e-props, and we all posted fairly regularily.  Things did eventually go sour though, as they are wont to do.    Due to a falling out between two of the community members, which somehow got blamed on my wife and I, the whole thing fell apart.  It got to the point that I couldn't post on my blog without it being brought up by venomous tongues.  After almost two years of thrice-weekly posting, I gave up blogging.  I was disgusted by the community that I had helped found, and I grew increasingly cynical about the content of the other blogs I found there.  That was over a year ago.    This blog is an attempt at a fresh start.  It's actually my sixth attempt at a fresh start in the last few months.  As the title of this post implies, I have very little trouble starting things over from scratch.  It's staying the course that tends to give me trouble.  The six previous incarnations of this journal survived only a handful of posts each.  I'm hoping that this time I'll find the patience and will to continue posting.    What's different this time?  I've just gotten back from a vacation that served as a very strong reminder of what my goals and priorities should be.  My previous six blog attempts have all been meandering and meaningless - I didn't know what I was writing about.  My original blog was meant as a chronicling of my spiritual, intellectual, emotional and physical growth, and I'm going to recapture that with this attempt.    The cosmetics of this journal are unimportant.  The only important thing is that I post regularly, keep my mind on the relevant topics, and don't EVER allow myself to delete what I've written.

						   The next time I see my wife, it will have been one month since we parted.  Originally, she was supposed to be back this Tuesday.  She has been visiting friends in the eastern US for the last week, and she decided that she was too close to her family in the Maritimes to NOT go visit them.  Up until last night, she gave me the impression that she might be there for a day or two.  The last time I saw her was July 23rd.  The next time I see her will be August 23rd.  I'm a bit of a mess as a result.  She thinks I'm angry with her, but that's not it really.  Yeah, I'm upset that she just kind of dumped all of this on me.  More than that though, I feel abandoned.  We were supposed to fix the condo up this month in order to sell it.  Am I to do that alone now?  She's not bringing in any income if she's out of town, so I'm stuck with covering all of the bills out of my own pocket in the meantime as well.  I wanted to kick out our room mates at the beginning of September as well, but it looks like that will be financially impossible too.  I had been hoping to find a new job through all of this too, but with all of this going on that's really not feasible.   The stress of everything is weighing very heavily on me.  Part of me has become very cold and hard.  I don't know what this means for her and I anymore.  I don't know if I can take any more surprises.
