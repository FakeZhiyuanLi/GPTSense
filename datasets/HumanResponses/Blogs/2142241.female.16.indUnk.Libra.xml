      I hate it when your relationship with someone like totally changes, especially when you were such good friends with that person.  it totally sucks.  i hate losing friends.  god, y do people have to change??? arg.  I just talked to the person and it was like we had nothing to talk about, and they annoy me now, and im sure i annoy them, and its like a little while ago we were such good friends.  its really sad.  I love her, but now its like i love who she used to be, and it's hard to be friends with who she is now.  *sigh* oh well... c'est la vie, right? and now im sitting at home bored as hell with nothing to do on a perfectly good saturday night.  blah.  sucks suck sucks.  and even if i had something to do I'd have no one to take me.  I NEED A DRIVERS LICENSE SO DAMN BAD!!!  aaaahhhh.    Oh, if anyone knows how to make it so that people can leave comments on here then tell me.  thanks.

      Hey all! ya today was a good day... had PSATs this morning (boring, but not too bad) so i had the rest of the afternoon free.  went to the creamery and had lunch with some friends, that was tons of fun.  oh and rebeccas bf came so i met him.  i guess hes a fine guy, but not really bf material, at least not up to par on my standards.  o well, if shes happy then i guess good for her.  then i went to reginas and hung out, and then went to the soccer game.  and now im putting off hw. Ugh, so we were talking about saides earlier, and i have no one to ask.  its very sad.  the only person that i kinda want to i cant so yea i dont know.  but i hate sadies.  here is my philosophy on the whole thing:  it takes away womens rights!!! thats right, steals em!! see, the only good part (well pretty much the only good part) of bein a girl is that we arent expected to ask the guys out, thats their job.  and here comes sadies, takin that away!!! now what do we have left??? nothing.  ugh.  but im not gonna go single, and i think all my friends r going, so i better find me a guy to ask.  any volunteers??? Well, off to do hw.  blech.  talk to u all later! mwah :)

      Hey!  the curse of the relatives is still upon me, but only for one more day!!! (well then it will just be a relative i really like so thats ok.)  i guess i shouldnt complain cuz i dont see them that often but aaahh.  i guess i didnt really post about thanksgiving...it was fine, the fights were kept to a minimum, considering everyone was in the same room for an extended period of time...so that was good.  lol when i was little i always wanted to sit at the adult table, and this yr there were no kids so there was only an adults table, and wow, let me tell u, mashed potato fights and turkey jokes made up by a 5 yr old r so much more fun.  but, alas, there was josh *sigh* (hes the hot guy from my last post) and damn good cheescake, not to mention awesome turkey, so i cant complain.  all in all it was pretty good. today we went to san jose to go to the art museum.  my mom works there and we always have to go there when family comes.  i hate it, im so not a modern art person.  so my sisters and i kinda hung out in the gift shop and i talked on my cell phone.  then we went to santana row, but we didnt really do anything there, so then we came home.  and then i took a nap.  pretty boring day... well, i must go deal with my camera happy grandfather now.  ill ttyl

      I found a line and then it grew I found myself still thinking of you I felt so empty and now I'm fine But still it's burning, when will you be mine?  Too much of the same stories in our lives I think it's time for change, don't you? Too much of the same stories in our lives I think it's time for us to walk away from here  Look at me still in your mind Our memories so intertwined Well you broke through and found your way And so did I no need to stay The same old picture, tried and true Been through there, lets looking for something new  Do you remember lying on the beach so late at night Do you remember running through the sprinklers that night Do you remember all the songs that I have wrote for you  I remember,the way you made me feel when I was with you I remember,the smile that always brought me back to you That look in your eyes, I never thought that this could be untrue

      life sucks.  finals suck.  studying all day really sucks.  spending a day without getting dressed or anything in sometimes a good thing tho :).  and now im tired.  but im waiting up cuz jen is coming over.  crazy girl.  she decided to come over at like 12:45.  am that is.  she should be here by 1:30.  good times, good times. Dude i was having this thought.  and its kinda weird cuz it came at a time when i hadnt stopped studying for a couple hrs, and now its gonna come out even weirder cuz im tired as hell.  but anyway, here goes.  so i was listenin  to ms payne talk about how she doesnt really see her high school friends anymore yesterday, and i was thinking about that today when i just couldnt take any more apes.  and i thought, all my friends now just happen to be the friends i have during this brief period in my life.  they rnt my friends as an absolute...just, the friends that i have now that i may never see again.  like, thats just weird.  cuz these people are my friends, and i cant see myself moving on and having another batch of friends...or the same for them.  it seems like a waste almost, and weird that people who are so close can just poof, move on.  but really, what if i go to school on the other side of the country from some of my best friends, and we swear to keep in touch, and we email during freshman year of college, and make an effort to see eachother when we r home during the same time,  but then we kinda stop having time and pretty soon we arent friends anymore.  and i am making NO SENSE.  i have no idea what im writting, but bassically it seems like these r gonna be my friends forever, but what if its really just my high school friends who i see at a reunion and im like oh hah wow i remember that person.  it just seems weird.  and sad.  and i need sleep.  stop reading this!!!! bye

And then there was the dance.  it was ok, it had its moments.

      yay we won our game.  3-1, woo hoo.  lol i totally shouldnt have played tho. as if i wasnt sick enough, now i have a worse cough and im gettin chills and im losing my voice.  blah...i cannot miss school.  oh well... but better news, my mom had coffee with sarahs mom today.  (for those of u who dont know sarah is my best friend of 8 yrs who was shipped off to one of those reform boarding schools and i havent seen her or heard from her in like 7 or 8 months.  bassically hell).  anyway my mom had coffee with her mom even tho she is still all pissed at her and probably always will be, but just so she could get info about sarah.  apparently we can start writting eachother in january.  i cant see her until september tho.  thats almost a yr, making a grand total of a yr and a half without seeing her.  thats horrible, i can even explain.  but at least we can start writting soon...and my mom got me some pictures of her which is good.  oh and apparently in english she had to write a paper about someone important in her life and she chose me, and she has 8 pages about me so far.  lol, its good to hear that she still thinks about me cuz sometimes i wonder if maybe shes moved on and doesnt really think about me ne more, whereas i think about her and miss her so much, all the time.  god i really just need her in my life right now.  like really bad.  *sigh* c'est la vie, i guess...as much as it sucks. well, off to drown myself in tea to try to get better!!! mwah

      Every time we lie awake; After every hit we take. Every feeling that I get; But I haven't missed you yet. Every room mate kept awake; by every sigh and scream we make All the feelings that I get; But I still don't miss you yet Only when I stop to think about it.  I hate everything about you, why do I, love you?

      fuck, do u care about my feelings at all?  call me selfish but id like to feel like i actually mean something to u, maybe even be important.  but no, i guess im not and i guess i just have to live with that.  i guess i have to deal with the fact that the relationship i want to have is just in my head.  if im just gonna be taking up time and space then forget it.  im prolly gonna delete this one soon because, honestly, who am i kidding?

      ALOHA!! whats shakin people.  Nothing much here, had service day today.  We went to a homeless shelter and helpped out.  It always kinda makes me sad going to those places, esspecially when i see kids, cuz i cant imagine how horrible it would be to grow up like that, without a home.  And the kids were sooo cute!!! i went into the daycare center and these little kids, they were prolly about 3, started laughing and talking to me, and they were like r u a mommy?? do u have a kid?? and i was like no.  and this other one was like do u have a mommy? and i was like yup.  and then he was like do u have a daddy? and i was like yup.  and then he was like lucky, i dont.  it was soo sad, this was the cutest little kid.  yea but it was fun, and the kids were so happy to just have me sit down and talk to them.  unfortunately talking to the kids wasnt what i was supposed to be doing so i didnt get to for that long.  so i organized a food closet (fun but a lot more stressful than it sounds!!!! lol) omg there were so many rasins, it was INSANE!!  and then jen and guilly and i came up with and put together some art projects for kids for tonight.  that was cool.  Jen is gonna make a great kindergarden teacher some day, lol.  I hope that doing all this good work today gave me some karma so that somebody up there has decided that its ok to let me pass my drivers test tomorrow! ITS HIGH FUCKING TIME!!! i hope third time is the charm, because if i fail three times that is just ABSURD, not to mention i have to go back to drivers ed.  but we wont talk about that.  because im gonna pass.  well, i have hella work to do so i need to get going.  Later!

      so today started out to be a complete bummer, but then it turned out to be pretty fun.  so i was gonna go skiing but the fuckin bus never came so we were at school from 4:30-7 AM THAT IS and waited for the bus but then we left so i went to santa cruz with regina, quinn, becca, and jason.  we went to capitola and got breakfast and then we went to the boardwalk.  we were like the only ppl there and so it was a lot of fun.  then we went to the mall in capitola for a little while, and then since we were all sooooo tired from being up since like 3 am we came home and slept.  and now im about to go see perfect score.  sooo...fun stuff :)   OH yesterday i had a meeting with the college councelor.  NYU might not be happening...fuck.  but ithaca might and she told me bout other colleges.  oh and she predicted my sat score to be like hella good.  so yea. just thot id mention that wellllllll i gotta get goin.  ttyl

      an ode to my dear friend lauren   lauren is a cow obsessed insanely cool wonderfully funny very fast swimmer. she (had) a white bravada named benny and has a dog, who some report bares strange resemblance to a pig. however aside from liking cows, being cool, cracking jokes, swimming, driving her benny and petting said pig-dog, lauren spends much of her time making delighful music on her guitar which as far as i know has no name. among her favorite songs are some eric claptan song that a 12 year old looking guitarist from somewhere in eastern europe can play and metallica stuff. and aside from all this lauren is moral, always right and moves a lot cuz shes lived in like all 50 states or something  by rebecca  :)

      oh one more thing...  whenever i step outside, somebody claims to see the light it seems to me that all of us have lost our patience. 'cause everyone thinks they're right, and nobody thinks that there just might be more than one road to our final destination  but i'm not ever going to know if i'm right or wrong 'cause we're all going in the same direction and i'm not sure which way to go because all along we've been going in the same direction  i'm tired of playing games, of looking for someone else to blame for all the holes in answers that are clearly showing for something to fill the space, was all of the time i spent a waste 'cause so many choices point the same way i was going.....  so why does there only have to be one correct philosophy? i don't want to go and follow you just to end up like one of them and why are you always telling me what you want me to believe? i'd like to think that i can go my own way and meet you in the end.  but i'm not ever going to know..........  fuckin AWESOME lyrics

      hmm, havent posted in a while, huh?  sorry bout that.  lets see.  just had a four day weekend, busy as hell.  partied and had rehersal and hung out with friends...ooh and i got a tadpole!! his name is frankie, and i might just be raising him for lauren, or i might keep him when he turns into a frog.  it depends.  but yea it was a total spur of the moment thing. hmmm, rewinding, lets see whats happened since i last updated... got all my finals back...all in all did pretty well, im kinda nervous for grades to come out this week tho. AAAHHH! they gotta be good. oh dude, the last thing that i wrote was that sarah sent me a present...it was a book of a bunch of memories she has with me...every chapter is a story about something we've been thru together.  theres like 12 stories in there, starting with the day we became best friends and ending with the last time we saw eachother.  i like started crying when i read it, i miss her so much.  i get to write her soon, so im happy about that.   hmm, well i guess if something life changing had happened i would have posted it, or at the very least would remember it right now, so i guess theres nothing i really gotta post...nothing i can think of at least... OH!! everyone come to the drama 3 play this weekend -- saturday at 7 and sunday at 4.  DUDE! im not kidding! come!! dont look around, im talking to YOU!!! yes, come, its gonna be good.   well, on that note, i think ill leave all u fine people.  have a good night.  mwah

      Romantic, hopeful, and composed. You are the Sonnet. Get it? Composed?       Sonnets want Love and have high ideals about it. They're conscientious people, caring & careful. You yourself have deep convictions, and you devote a lot of thought to romance and what it should be. This will frighten away most potential mates, but that's okay, because you're very choosy with your affections anyway. You'd absolutely refuse to date someone dumber than you, for instance.        Lovers who share your idealized perspective, or who are at least willing to totally throw themselves into a relationship, will be very, very happy with you. And you with them. You're already selfless and compassionate, and with the right partner, there's no doubt you can be sensual, even adventurously so.       You probably have lots of female friends, and they have a special soft spot for you. Babies do, too, at the tippy-top of their baby skulls.    hmm...interesting...  i am sick, and that sucks.  and so does this fucking english paper.  baaaahhh  been in bed all day, and this paper is getting no where.  i guess ill go finish it and probably fall asleep while trying to do so.  adios

      There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street  We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here, not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise  Be together for one more night Somewhere, somehow  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

      hey!! im back from spain.  it was sooo awesome! so much fun.  i had a blast.  did sooo much.  sightseeing, shopping (thanks leila for showing me h&m!!!) hanging out, lot of eating, hehe.  spanish tortilla and paella (sp?) is soo good.  lot of fish and pork tho, not really my cup of tea.  we started in madrid, and there we went to some museums and then hung out and shopped and did some sighteeing. then we went to toledo.  toledo was this gorgeous old little town, reminded me a lot of italy.  then after we went to granada... granada rocked, it was this little town with all these little tea shops and stands and stuff, and the alhambra, this old arab castle, was cool.  then we went to sevilla.  awesome town, so much shopping and stuff to do.  then cordoba...saw a mosque, did some shopping and walkin around...pretty cool.  then we took an overnight train to barcelona.  i loved barcelona...soooo much to do.  so much culture and then las ramblas, the big shopping street was awesome.  some sketchy people there tho...i dont know about some of them.  but yea, sooo much fun.  hehe and its really cool cuz the legal age there is 16...didnt drink or ne thing tho...of course not im a good girl 0:-)  i want to study abroad over there or something.   so yes, it rocked so much.  and now im dirty and tired from a 2 hr and then another 11 hr plane ride...tho i slept most of the 11 hr one.  i dont know y planes make u tired even when u sleep.  o well.  im off.  hasta luego!

      Finally I figured out But it took a long, long time But now there's a turnabout Maybe 'cause I'm trying   There's been times, I'm so confused All my roads, They lead to you I just can't turn and walk away   It's hard to say what it is I see in you Wonder if I'll always be with you But words can't say, And I can't do Enough to prove, It's all for you   I thought I'd seen it all 'Cause it's been a long, long time But then we'll trip and fall Wondering if I'm blind  Rain comes pouring down Falling from blue skies Words without a sound Coming from your eyes

      omfg formal was soo awesome.  i had the time of my life.  it was seriously like one of the best nights i can remember having in soooo long.  i danced my ass off for 3 hrs straight non stop. litterally. and everyone looked so pretty :).  ahh i had so much fun just dancin and stuff with friends.  and i learned that dancing crazily with girlfriends to slow songs is sooo much more fun than dancing to them with a guy.  hehe.  oh, and single people rock!! power to the sinngle chicks!!! *clink shirly temples*  hehe good times, good times.  im happy it ended up being so much fun cuz i kinda wasnt sure.  and when we got there were like hardly ne people, but we started dancin and more people came and yea it ended up rocking.  so yes, a good night :).  acctually im prolly the only one who had THAT much fun...but o well, lol.   no one ever get the mini burgers at dennys.  jersey made that mistake, now lets no one repeat it.

      *sigh* awesome song...  Beauty queen of only eighteen She had some trouble with herself He was always there to help her She always belonged to someone else  I drove for miles and miles And wound up at your door I've had you so many times but somehow I want more  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  Tap on my window knock on my door I want to make you feel beautiful I know I tend to get insecure It doesn't matter anymore  It's not always rainbows and butterflies It's compromise that moves us along My heart is full and my door's always open You can come anytime you want  I don't mind spending everyday Out on your corner in the pouring rain Look for the girl with the broken smile Ask her if she wants to stay awhile And she will be loved She will be loved  I know where you hide Alone in your car Know all of the things that make you who you are I know that goodbye means nothing at all Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

      Tears flow like an overdue storm falling down my cheeks, the arid mountains sunburned from too much exposure to the artificial heat of a rare winter And I see your face in the puddle they form Staring up at me with those piercing eyes as if they are tugging at my soul trying to catch the waterfall eminating from me,  the substance of your life But as they fall faster the puddle turns to a lake slowly drowning the beautiful image of you I hear you calling to me out to me as you sink down, down deeper into the creation of my sadness and fear

      hey, its me.  duh.  its 11:15 and i still have several hours of homework.  but its one of those nights where it doesnt seem like i could concentrate on my homework if i tried, which i have, and i dont feel like going to sleep any time soon anyway.  so i think im gonna update u all on my life instead of continuing my futile attempt to write an essay on something i dont know about in a language i hardly speak, just to get into bed and not be able to sleep. dont u all wish u were me?  so this weekend jen and becca and i took a road trip to davis/sacramento.  IT WAS SO MUCH FUN!! first time bein all on my own, and didnt get into too much mischief.  i think thats a pretty good accomplishment.  anywho, it was a blast.  we looked at UC Davis (for jen) and then stayed in a hotel in sacramento.  uc davis was hella tight, although i dont think i could go there, its way too big.  but its like a little town, its cool.  and jen really liked it so that was cool.  and yea. hah funny things on the trip: (if ur not jen or becca i dont think ull care but i feel like recording them) roadtrip! ROADTRIP! ROADTRIP!!  yea.. i dont see that getting old... FUCK FRUITRIDGE!!! omg we r soooo making bumper stickers!! oh and I SURVIVED 5!! hahahaha the sex chair!!! EEEWWW!!! you touched the sex chair!!! you have sex on u EWW!!! hahaha *at the taco bell drive through* jen in an indian accent: excuse me we'd like 3 hamburgers... and the convo goes on hahahaha.  "a big fuck you to our country!!!"  haha CHINESE FIRE DRILL!! its like a sushi bar over here! haha wtf??? omg and so many more that i cant think of right now and that no one cares about  oh and a news update: my car officially has a name: MEL! only took like 7 months...  oh and yea jen acctually did it.  she officially turned me onto country music.  its a miracle.  i tell u, that girl has talent.  speaking of which, i have to post an awesome song.  acctually, awesome doesnt do it justice.  its great.  its the sweetest song ever written, hands down.  perfect lyrics.  (and yes, its country.  so DEAL)  Well I'll never forget the first time that I heard That pretty mouth say that dirty word And I can't even remember now What she backed my truck into But she covered her mouth and her face got red And she just looked so darn cute That I couldn't even act like I was mad Yeah I live for little moments like that That's like just last year on my birthday She lost all track of time and burnt the cake And every smoke detector in the house was going off She was just about to cry until I took her in my arms And I tried not to let her see me laugh Yeah I live for little moments like that I know she's not perfect But she tries so hard for me And I thank God that she isn't Cause how boring would that be It's the little imperfections It's the sudden change of plans When she misreads the directions And we're lost but holding hands Yeah I live for little moments like that When she's laying on my shoulder  On the sofa in the dark And about the time she falls asleep So does my right arm And I want so bad to move it Because it's tingling and it's numb She looks so much like an angel That I don't want to wake her up Yeah I live for little moments When she steals my heart again and doesn't even know it Yeah I live for little moments like that --Little Moments by Brad Paisley  omg its the sweetest song ever written.  i want to be that girl to someone, someone who doenst love me just because they think im cool and pretty (though if they thought i was cool and pretty i wouldnt complain :-p) but who loves all the little quirks about me and everything.  those little moments.  because really, thats what life is made of, and when u look back on it, its those perfect little moments, when ur lying in his arms and hes running his fingers through ur hair and whatever u were worried about before doesnt matter anymore but life is ok right then, and if you could stay like that forever, then it would just always be ok.  or when ur lost or u burned the cake or whatever and he loves u for that too.  i hope thats the case.  if so, im a fucking lucky girl.  well i am a fucking lucky girl, but yea.  ;)  anyway, i think its time to get to work.  if you r still reading you should get some kind of reward.

      lordy lordy lordy.  sat diagnostic tests suck.  humans were not meant to sit in one place for 3 hrs straight, let alone think about obscure things that are not needed in life.  AND THE SAT IS IN A WEEK AND A HALF!!! AAAAHHH!!! mm hmm, im just a little stressed.  just a tad.  summer needs to hurry its ass up and come.    dude, check out this site http://www.costofwar.com/index-college-scholarships.html its hella fuckin scary.  i mean seriously, what is this world coming to?  how is it so hard to see that educating children is so much better than killing them?  and if 3 million scholarships seems too extreme, how about one million and using the rest of the money to feed and shelter those in need instead of bombing and killing them?  think about how much better the world would be if all the money that america is using to bomb iraq and all that shit went to eduacting people, or feeding hungry children,  or providing medicine so that some countries where 50% of infants die have hope for a future.  this might seem really idealistic and impossible, but there has to be some way to help instead of hurt.  some way for the powers that be to see how many scholarships and things could be made possible with the money we are using to kill people.  call me a rambling hippie, maybe i am.  but i dunno, that just kinda struck somethin in me. leave me a note and tell me what u think.

      woah dude... havent updated in a hella long time.  sorry bout that...if anyone really cares.  lets see whats new? im fuckin sick right now.  seriously, i think im gonna die.  yesterday i had a fever of 103...not cool.  today it was like 100 when i woke up but now its gone so i guess thats good.  i still feel like crap tho. they thought it was strep throat but i got tested yesterday and its not... so umm... on fri i spent the night in the city with jersey cuz her bday was sat.  happy bday jersey!! shes 17 now, woo hoo.  sat we went shopping in union square...boy did we go shopping.  i bought so much.  and then sat night we partied (lauren, me, mike, jersey) for jersey's bday...haha partied pretty hard ;)  we saw some major baboons if u catch my drift!! (haha prob only lauren gets that one, but am i right lauren?? nice visit from ol' mary jane the baboon!! hahahahah!  ok enough of that)  what else.. i still dont have my car back!! peice of crap car people, i miss it!! :'(  and um.. so i leave tomorrow to go to the east coast to look at colleges... well first im going to DC for passover. i hope i feel better, all the yelling that is bound to happen due to all of my mother's side of the family all thrown into one house wont help my headache... although the fights ussually take place at thanksgiving, not so much at passover.  but then off to look at colleges.  im kinda like having a crisis about where i want to go now, cuz up until now i was lookin at small liberal arts schools, and thats primarily what im looking at over there (all but nyu which is sooo not happening)  and now i dont want to go to a small liberal arts school. but it sucks cuz the schools i want to go to are all way out of my range, and i cant really find a school that is right for me that i like and that i can go to, but i dunno i like the ones im gonna go look at so maybe ill fall in love with one, who knows. right now what i want to do (keep in mind, this changes about every other day) is go to uc santa cruz for a yr and then transfer to nyu or somewhere... but who knows.  and do i really wanna do the college app thing twice?  o well it will all work out...hopefully... i say ... a lot huh? dude erika is so fuckin funny..i just read her livejournal thing and omg that girl cracks me up!  she is way too cool to be a freshman  well and some other stuff... good stuff... that some ppl know... yea im happy... :)  um, well i need to try to venture out of bed now (dun dun duuuunnn) to pack.  uuuggghhhh... :(  yea long ass post.  im gonna go now.  bye!!

      yo!  so jen is here... good times.  last nite we studied history till 2.  haha good times, believe it or not.  the greatest was after i was falling asleep and jen poured water on me and then she dragged me out of my closet with my pants half on telling me i couldnt go to sleep till id faught the korean war.  hahahahahaha.  yea...  so graduation was sad.  then laurens party was cool. last night we (lauren and becca and i) were gonna go to the movies, but then we were passing great america and then we decided to go there instead.  that was fun but we only got to go on one ride b4 it closed.  o well. then we picked up jen and drove around listening to caress me down lord knows how many times.  then we came home and studied history.  we were so productive! yay go us!  then this morning we woke up at NINE!! yes NINE!!! turns out the sun is up that early, who knew?  yea so then we went to school to get my history book and then had a great adventure at bianchinnis involving a baguette war and half a pound of turkey.  and... now we need to work!    jen and my letter to the UN:  to whomever it may concern: we have a proposal to solve the palistine conflict.  follow our instructions and there will be no more fighting. first, measure Jerusalem. then, make a river in the middle.  (note: make sure the middle of Jerusalem is the middle of the river, or someone will bitch that the river is on their side).  then, get a bunch of crocodiles and electric eels, and put them in the river.  there: jews and arabs and coexist in one holy and croc infested land. Respectfully yours, Sara and Jen.  o ya, sara and jen saving the world one treaty at a time  ok NOW its time to work.  BYE!

      omg im so pissed.  the debate went so badly.  the other side sucks and wont even debate the correct topic -- we kept getting off on when life starts and all that and we r not there to discuss babies we r up there to discuss the womans right to choose.  not if its right but who gets to choose!!! and did we ever touch upon that ONCE??? NO!! gah and they said we were PRO DEATH!!! PRO DEATH!!! i know im just up there for my grade and all but it really is somethin i feel strongly about, so i mean callin me pro death is a personal attack.  and like my buggest pet peeve is when i have something i really want to say and people wont listen to me.  i HATE it when people wont listen to me, which is like y i got so mad, cuz no one would listen to me.  i was like screaming after class.  it takes  LOT to get me that mad and worked up.  gah.  im pissed.  and the kicker, i think they are winning.   AAAAHHHH  but then i got a chai shake.  and that made things a little better.    oh and my theology class sucks cuz they cant follow directions and put the right things in the right folders so that i can edit and compile it all.  gsh, just a stressful day.    i think its time for a well deserved nap.  good night.

      Along the edges, colors blur it seemed familiar. While you read your magazine, I was counting all the markers.  And California seemed to draw you like a siren From a postcard, in a letter, or a frame of film melting.  Under you, I feel your breath move in, out slowly.  Under you, let go completely feeling you take over me. Take over me.  A Hollywood flat where we'd laugh about our fortunes  Well we had jobs in this bar down at 3rd and San Vicente. And Ramen Noodles at 4:30 in the morning,  When we barely could survive, I was never more alive.   Under you, I feel your blood flowing out slowly.  Under you, let go completely feeling you take over me. Take over me.  You moved in slow degrees A sudden memory You're a Leonard Cohen song  But every now and then I'd swear I see you standing on a sidewalk,  In a restaurant, from a taxi passing by.  Under you I feel your breath move in, out slowly. Under you let go completely feeling you take over me.  Take over me

      so today was a fun day.  in the morning we had junior senior breakfast.  that was fun.  the seniors got us picture frames with diff quotes and proverbs in each one... we got them flip flops, sorta as a symbolic shedding of the dress code apparently.  julie was sorta a bitch about it saying it was a crappy present and theirs to us was so much better... but w/e we all know shes a bitch.  then there was senior chapel... that was ok, but then there was the whole senior innitiation thing where the juniors moved into the senior seats... dun dun dun... haha that was cool.  woo hoo class of 05 movin on up!! :-p  then there was yearbook distribution... the yearbook is hella cool this year.  cool stuff.  and like the coolest pic ever of 5 of us made it in there and that was really cool.  and ummm yea.  and then there was carnival.  we made a truse (sp?) on the water fight thing... so we just hung out and signed yearbooks and fun stuff.   and then tonight i had a meeting for working at the ronald mcdonald house this summer... im working 3-6 on thursdays (while im here) sooo yea...  i need to write my spanish story.  that sucks.  ill talk to yall later

      i have something to say.  cosmo magazine is totally degrading to women. they say they r all aboy women power -- bullshit!  the entire magazine is about how to change yourself in order to make men like you.  as if a woman needs to somehow conform to be what a man wants her to be.  they never once say be urself and if he doesnt like u fuck him (my personal philosophy).  no, instead they use all 314 pages to tell how what u need to do in order to make every man fall madly in love with you.  and women read this magazine religiously, every moment believing their cruel lies that they need to somehow change who they are, who they have become over their 20-something years of life, in order to please men.  it totally goes back to the old view that women need to do whatever they can to please men.  i thought we had come out of that period, but according to the most popular women's magazine on shelves, our society is still subconciously guided by these principles.   yea...im getting my english project done...

      CONGRATS TO ZACH FOR GETTING HIS LICENSE!!!! :-D  so, funny story.  so this morning i had a quiz on the scarlet letter, which i havent been reading.  rebeccas read it, tho, so we decided that she would go to my english class and take it for me, and id go sit in chem for her.  it would be ok on my end cuz im not sure mr tang even knows i exist, and he deff wouldnt know that im not rebecca.  so we were gonna do this and we were like walking to the classes and then becca decides no cuz ms eikmeier isnt that slow and would prolly realize.  so we didnt end up doing that, but we almost did.  k so not that funny, but hey, my life isnt too entertaining. oh and ben talked to fr maurus and made up some bullshit excuse as to why it would benifit him to come to my history class from now on instead of doing busy work in AP bio, and fr maurus bought it, so now ben gets to come to history with me :)  hehe poor kid, im such a bad influence, huh ben? hehe :-p oh and YAY FOR LAUREN!!! :-p  ok well i actually have hw today *gasp* so i think ill get crackin on that.  talk to yall lata

(near You)  Cause everything inside me looks like Everything I hate You are the hope I have for change You are the only chance I'll take  When I'm on fire When You're near me I'm on fire When You speak And I'm on fire Burning at these mysteries These mysteries...

      so, you know how i said last week was the worst week?  well i lied.  this one is gonna take the cake.  aaahhh i never kne it was humanly possible to be so stressed out, and for such an extended period of time.  it needs to be summer soon, cuz i swear i may not make it.   haha its ale's bday tomorrow and i just asked her if shes gonna be home cuz im gonna go stop by with balloons and shit, and she totally forgot it was her bday.  lol she NEVER remembers her bday, shes so funny.  she also doesnt ever know how old she is.  lol.  it would have been funny if i stopped by with ballons and she still didnt remember it was her bday, she would have been like ummm u got issues girl.  lol.    i got the pics from davis! some are just plain weird, we took a lot of the sex chair.  haha.  but i FINALLY got the freakin kodac cd thingy to work on my comp.  its hella cool.  yup yup.  ok, well im off.  adios.

      hey yall.  havent updated in a while.  sorry, last week was the week from hell.  test, shitload of work, 4 hour sat tutoring sessions, mental breakdowns, the list goes on.  anywho, yesterday i took the sats.  that was not fun.  but, one less thing i have to worry about.  now i just have to worry about how i did, which sucks too, but its better to worry about something u cant do anythin about cuz then its out of ur hands.  wow my mom just (as in right after i typed that) came in and gave me the sex talk.  heres the recap, word for word: mom: "it seems like you and zach are getting pretty serious, and thats great --"  me: mom we're not having sex mom: ok -- me: and we r not planning on having sex mom: ok, but that might change.  and if it does i want you think really hard about it.  and im not sure its a good idea. me: OKAY! mom: and if you decide its just something you have to do, i want you to talk to me about it so i can make sure you are safe me: uuhh... ok... [yea fuckin right] mom: BEFORE you do it me: ok.... [again, ya fuckin right] mom: promise me? me: uhh... ya... mom: sara!! me: yes!    well that was interesting.  like im really gonna tell her anyway.  i kinda feel bad promising her something i have no intention of doing, but o well.  anyway, where was i before that little interuption.  oh ya, sats.  so after the sat zach and i went to santa cruz.  that was a lot of fun.  then we just spent the day together.  good times :)  now i have to do a bunch of hw, go to a surprise party for cynthia at 2:30, then go prom dress shopping with the lovely ariel.  fun stuff.  well, except having more hw than my brain has the capacity to comprehend.  on that note, i better go do it.  its been real.

      so i had to go to my aunt's funeral today.  it was really sad.  i didnt think i was gonna get overly emotional because i wasnt that close to her but i got really sad.  i think it had mostly to do with all the people i am close to crying and stuff.  but yea.  it was sad, as to be expected of a funeral...  then i hung out with my cousins during the reception.  and talked to my uncle who is in social work and said he will give me a job when i finish college! woot!  we will see if that holds true in 5 years but yea.  woah, 5 years??? 5 years and im done with school and will have a career??? no way.  ok thats weird.  then i went bowling tonight with jen and jon and becca.  good times, as always.  dancing around and bowling extremely badly (though i would have won the 4th game if evil jon hadnt gotten a strike at the LAST MINUTE!!! bah!)  then we went to dennys for a minight snack, and now jen is here and we are chillin.  like a villian.  becca is passed out on the chair in her room and jen is in the kitchen eating penut butter.    tomorrow (well... today.... but yea) i have to pack and shit and then i leave thursday am!!! aaaaahhh!!   ok well thats bout it.  oh jen doesnt like the red in my hair.  that makes me sad.  o well it washes out in 6-12 washes.    now thats it.  arivadichi!!

      lazy day.  slept till 3.  very nice.  then hung out with jen for a bit, and then went to dinner with regina and becca at fosters freeze.  then regina and i went to the batting cages! it was so much fun!! lol i wore a catchers helmet with one of those face masks cuz i was scared a ball would hit me.  i looked funny :-p we were really bad but it was really fun.  then we went to reginas house and put red streaks in my hair.  we were gonna do her tips but never got around to that.  then fuckin drama with jason.  well it didnt have to be drama but knowin me it was.  i thought it was too much trouble to be mad at him, and now it seems its too much trouble to forgive him.  whatever.  guys suck.  then regina decided we had to hang out with him which was altogether too akward after talking to him.  but yea. whatever. i dont care anymore.    i have to go to my great aunt's funeral tomorrow in palm springs.  :(  its kinda late and i should probably get some sleep, but i dont want to.  maybe ill go watch 10 things i hate about you.    i miss zach so much.  im not gonna last 6 more weeks without him.  *tear*

      for zach:   It’s a big mistake 50 days, 3 months away I’d be laughing today But your voice on the phone gives me no reason  Don’t take from me My heart is barely beating Don’t take from me I’m falling down  All I want to do is lie in bed with you All I really ever need is you All I got to do is give up all I have to be with you  It’s a different day 1500 miles away Why would you want to stay? So take a look around  All I want to do is lie in bed with you All I really ever need is you All I got to do is give up all I have to be with you  All I want to do is to be close to you All I want to do is to be next to you All I want is you to give up all we had to be I can’t remember why I’m here If you’d let me spend my life with you

      wow, interesting night last night. started off good and fun (everyone needs to read jens entry in the communal blog (planningshenanigans.blogspot.com) about our adventures mini golfing and such, cuz it was just so great and she is better at writing about it then me so just see what she has to say).  so yea that was awesome, greatest game of mini golfing ive ever played.  well "mini golf" is a stretch after all of our rule changes... and so is "playing" seein as we r so bad... but like i said, read hers.  so yea then after that, there was a MAJOR CRISIS involving a shitty bf (jen's, not mine) a pool hall, san jose, and some roads that dont really exist, a dead cell phone, and a really big fight.  i dont want to spell it all out.  it was bad.  there were tears.  it got messy.  we wont speak of it.  so yea, gonna go to lunch with jen and becca and maybe regina and maybe ben... well if we ever decide where to go.  man i love summers... wake up late, do whatever i want, stay out late... thats the life.  anyway im gonna take off.  adios.

      Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep, this air is blessed, you share with me. This night is wild, so calm and dull, these hearts they race, from self control. Your legs are smooth, as they graze mine, we're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all.  My hopes are so high, that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  The words are hushed lets not get busted; just lay entwined here, undiscovered. Safe in here from all the stupid questions. "hey did you get some?" Man, that is so dumb. Stay quiet, stay near, stay close they can't hear... so we can get some.  My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me. So won't you kill me, so I die happy. My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury, or wear as jewelery, which ever you prefer.  Hands down this is the best day I can ever remember, I'll always remember the sound of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights, the scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers and the time on the clock when we realized it's so late and this walk that we shared together. The streets were wet and the gate was locked so I jumped it, and I let you in. And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist and you kissed me like you meant it. And I knew that you meant it, that you meant it

      so, the history final thuroughly sucked.  i studied way too much for it to have been that hard.  :(  o well.  i find out how i did tomorrow... eek..  just an english final tomorrow, which i am hours and hours from being ready for, and then im done!! YAY!!!  but gettin thru this english final is gonna be quite a feat...  so, my aunt is really sick, and has been for a while, and shes gettin really bad. and my dad just told me that they decided that they are going to disconect the feeding tube, which means she is gonna die in like a week or 2.  really sad.  sadder for a lot of other people who r a lot closer to her, but yea, sad.   speaking of sad, so becca and regina find this one eyed dog today and they call the shelter who has them call the police and the police took it away!!! they just like dragged this little one eyed dog by the collar and that was the last they saw of it. i dont know y but that made me sad.  maybe its just that time...   omg i have to tell u the sweetest thing.  Jen's bf shows up at her door last night with 2 roses (he didnt have the money for a dozen but he didnt want to give her just one) all the way from SAN CARLOS which is like AN HOUR from her house to say hi and he hoped she did well on her finals.  HOW FUCKIN SWEET IS THAT?? yea,  i thought so too.  so lets see.  i need to write an essay on various relationships in american lit, complete with quotes that i need to MEMORIZE and then either change my essay on symbolizm in scarlet letter or wrte a new one on somethng else.  that sucks.  beyond belief.  and im tired. and lazy.  AND SO READY FOR THS YEAR TO BE OVER.    one more day. just an hour and a half. i can do it.  right??  i think so...

Jon: sweetie, LET GO! hes gonna hit himself and hes gonna go home with a black eye and his mom is gonna be like what happened? and hes gonna be like i punched myself in the face with a ketchup bottle.

      so im pickin up where jen left off (hi, its sara now).  so anyway, she didnt finish talking about that one stupd hole... this stupid site only lets u post a little at a time.  so anyway. i bowl my ball (after hitting it in the water 3 times) and am all excited that it made it over the stupid bridge.  so i look up and see jen bounding backward, inches away from the water, golf club in hand, yelling "ILL SAVE IT!! COME BACK YOU DAMNED BALL!!" so this was all too much.  so i plop down on my ass in the middle of the hole, (in the puddle the whole fiasco created none the less) and im laughing hysterically and im like I... HAVE... TO... PEE!!! but i was laughin so hard i couldnt get up.  wow, lots of weird stares.  so we FINALLY finish this hole, and on the next. so this next hole is one of those windmill things.  and see you have to just get it over this hump and hit the windmill and then ur ball comes rolling out underneath (these caused some issues, namely not beng able to find the place where our balls came out, but thats another story) so anyway, on this windmill one, there is this little door in the windmill and if you make it in there its a hole in one. not an easy feat mind you.  so jen, thinking she was safe seeing how badly i was playing, was like if you get it in that little door, you can have a hole in zero!! so what do i do? I HIT IT IN THE DOOR ON MY FIRST TRY!!! yea, it was awesome.  so i get a hole in zero.  haha and then the people who started like half an hour after us caught up to us (yea we were playing pretty slowly what with all the interuptions and rule changes.  see, jen plays where if you hit it out of bounds u get to start back at the begining and ur back at one.  so i hit it out on like my 8th try (yes most people play where you stop at 6... we play where u stop at 15... and then we started playing where if you get to 15 you can start counting backwards) so yea i hit it out and what happens?  i put it back at the begining and im back at my first hit.  good rule.) so ANYWAY these people caught up to us so we needed to start playing faster.... oh yea and then jen is standing in the middle of the hole on the phone and i hit my ball and it totally smacked her in the ankle, and shes like FUCK YOU and we look up and there were a lot of little people there.  yea....  so it was fun.  except, acctually, it sucked, because the clown left.  thats right people, no more clown.   if you read all of both of these entries, who the fuck are you and whay dont you have a life???? yea... you can comment, though you you are probably speachless by now  ps. jen likes you. she says you are dedicated. :)

      ok so weird things happen when Sara and I hang out. Take Golfland for example. Miniature golfing, good ol' family fun....fun for everyone really. You'd think that Golfland would be safe from us. You really would....but they made one vital mistake...yes, yes my friends they made a bridge. With water. Underneath it. BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIG MISTAKE BUDDY! So sara and i are just playin a nice friendly game of golf when all of hte sudden we find ourselves at this watery hole. So I go and hit it over np. Then there was Sara. Sara my freinds has "issues" with hitting the ball and not the astroturf. In fact, from now on we'll have to call her one wrist sara due to an unfortunate golfing incident. When she did hit it though, she hit it in the water and went "fishing". Like literally. The ball went under the bridge and what does sara do? Use her hand to get it out you say? Yea, wrong. She uses her golf club and says "Im going fishing" Really now. Then she gets to start over back at one cause see I play that if you hit it out of bounds you get to start over. I think its ingenius, most think it cheating. To hte latter I say fuck you! Ok so anyway I suggest to Sara to bowl it over, so she goes throws back her arm and lets that sucker fly. Well, unfortuanetly she let it fly a little too hard and so it went over but hit hte back of the course and then came barreling back towards hte bridge. Seeing its immediate danger I went barreling over, golf club at the ready...like a hockey player i was....except that in tryin to rescues sara's shot I forgot that I would be rrunning over a bridge and as such almost fell in to the little river. Luckily though time slowed down in one of those RUUUUN FOOOOOOREEEEESSSSTTTT RUN moments and I saved my ass and sara's ball. It was brilliant, bloody brilliant. Ok so all that drama was just one hole.

      it wasnt my idea for that to be our name, in fact it was jens and i just happened to agree...but anyway i decided that it was stupid a while ago and tried to change it but these people dont let you change your name thingy...at least im not computer literate enough to figure out how one might do such a thing. so i guess we are stuck with this name. oh well.  ~Rebecca~ p.s. why do we have to scroll down so far to see this stuff?? someone fix it!!
