						   It's the end of a old day, and dawn of a new one.  I finally gotten a letter from Justin.  He assures me that he is well and that it's getting easier and harder at the same time.  He keeps saying that if he doesn't make it, that he doesn't know how he will show his face back here again.    When he talks like this, he scares me.  What if he doesn't make it, will he do something rash like kill him self, or just not come home?  I know this is silly, because I believe that he can do this, and he will do this, even if he is the oldest in his plattoon and the only married man.  Reading his letters just remind me of the man I fell inlove with years ago.  I haven't seen that man in so long...   He has changed so much over there, and I have changed so much...  I know our relationship will change because of it.   I am a little afraid of it to.  What if the man he will become won't like the woman I am becoming.  What if, while he is at boot, he meets this attractive thin young woman, and decides to leave me.  What if I am fretting over nothing.  I mean his letters pour on and on about how much he misses me, and loves me.  So I shouldn't be worried right? RIGHT?  Anyway I can't help but worry alittle it's in my nature.   I am so tired that this will probibly be the shortest of my blogs, but remind me to tell you all about the search of Young Frankenstien...

						   Nothing like a slow sunday, watching the ball game, and drinking a soda. I am sitting in the family room of my parents house, listening to my parents talk to my son, and praising him for throwing away a banana peel. He usually likes to throw things away, including toys, keys, and anything else that he gets a hold of. Peter is talking his usual jibberish, and I only wish I could understand what profound thoughts my son must be saying. I feel like he is like little Stewie from the family guy. An obvious genius, but no one can understand a word he is saying. I believe good old Vinny is right. Peter will be the next ruler of the world.... Or maybe he will just be a garbage man. I will love him regardless.  I went to church today. I figure that if my methodist husband has decided to go to catholic mass, then I, who am catholic, should do the same. Suprisingly Peter was very good there. So I have decided to go when I am not working, which is about every other week. I keep thinking on why I haven't been going the past 3 years, but I really can't think of an answer. I never stopped beliving in god, and I have been praying. Maybe it was that it required me to get up earlier than I wanted so I just stopped going. Now, Peter gets me up by 8am at the latest and I really don't have any real excuse.  I hate were wolves... I know what your thinking: Jess, where the hell did that come from. Well, let me tell you. I am kinda writing/roleplaying with an old friend ( mainly love stories... you know me, I can't pass up a good romance.) and she is really intrested into dark science fiction. Now, I love the concept behind demons, angels, and vampires, but I never got into the were wolf world. Now she has me working on a story about were wolves, and she keeps bringing up terms that I have never heard of, from a universe I am not familar with. Oh, she has sent me several links on were wolves, there packs, and other things.. but the more I learn, the less I like them. The sad thing is, that it was my idea to do this line, so I am completely to blame.  I still haven't heard anything from Justin. The recruit told me there might be a delay in mail, but I still am having a problem with getting letters every day to not getting anything. I know he is really busy, and is probibly to tired to write. He only has 11 more weeks to go. I hope they fly. I am going to be the proadest wife at his graduation. I can't wait to go, if only I can get some one willing to take Peter. I am not going to travel by my self, again, with a three year old. I can't do it again.  Well that is all that's on my mind today. I know I am a little long winded, but hey, I always have been. Till tomorrow, adu.

						        Well it's nap time in the Stamper residence and I find my self watching my little boy sleep peacefully on my sofa.  He looks so sweet holding on to his blanket.  He reminds me of his father.  Watching Peter sleeping, for some reason makes me feel closer to Justin.  I know that sounds silly but it's true.  Every day he looks more and more like his father, and less and less like me.   I guess that's a good thing considering if he looked like a girl he probibly would never hear the end of being teased.  I do worry though that he will be teased, for the pure fact that his father and I never really were in the "in" crowd.  But that may be a good thing since the "in" crowd is more prone to doing self destructive things.       I had a weird dream last night, I don't usually remember my dreams and I wrote this one down.  I am not going to go into the details but it had to do with a terrorist attack in New York, and 3 of Sept and info-red pizza (don't ask).  I have no idea why Sept 3 is important to me, but it must have some sort of meaning...  I don't know, maybe I am just remembering Sept 11, although that hasn't been on my mind in a long time.   I know I have been thinking alot about terrorist because I want this stupid war with the middle east over, and the only way that will happen is if we get rid of all of them.  If that will ever happen.  I know where the pizzza came from, I had pizza for dinner, so maybe that is why I had the dream....       I really need to get off the computer and do some laundry, and run some errands, not to mention put on something other than my pj's but I really can't seem to pry my self away.  I want to get Peter's hair cut, and to get him some cute outfits.  I also am really craving McDonalds.  I am trying to be on a diet, so I can lose some weight, and be more attractive when Justin get's out of boot.  I think I am going to cheat a little today, though.  Then again, I have been cheating alot so maybe I should just give up on that diet concept.  Any way the angel has awaken, crabby and hungry so I better get going.

						   Hello all,  Yes I am a follower, I recieved Steve and Vince's blog, and I think it's an excellent idea. So, here I go.  Today will complete Justin's first week in regular basic. I haven't recieved a letter from him since last saturday. I went from getting 2 letters a day to not getting any. I keep telling my self not to worry, that I was told that there is a delay in mail and that has got to be the reason I haven't heard anything. But his previous letter's were so sad and home sick, that I do worry. I know it looks like I am a controlling wife, who treats him like a child, but there is alot more to it than that. He likes strong women, it's kind of a turn on. Plus he knows it makes me feel better to tell him what to do in public. It makes me feel like I have some control in our lives... Besides Justin doesn't usually think his actions through, such as putting his cigerette out on a dry leaf, or throwing trash out the kitchen window. I am sure that will all change when he gets out of boot camp. He is a good man, I love him dearly, and I know that he loves me. Our relationship has already changed so drasticly since he left, that I do not recoginze it any more. In his letters he has said more to me than he has ever said since before we got married. I have fallen in love with him all over again. I didn't think I would miss him as much as I do now, and I find myself writing him almost every day. (I would every day, but after work and Peter some days I just don't have the energy.) I also find myself waiting impatiently for the mail man so I can see if a letter from him has arrived. I keep telling my self only 11 more weeks till I can see him again, and that does help a little.  Peter, my son, has yet to really start talking. I, being the concerned mother I am have contacted first steps and they have validated my concern. They say Peter is developmentally delayed in speech and comprehention. I don't agree with the comprehention part, here at home he seems to know what I am always talking about, some times a little to well. First steps think that he can follow my commands since I usually guesture with the comand and he understands the guesture, and since I have heard this, I have been testing this out by not guestering. I have been giving him different unusual commands with out using hand movements, and when I do, Peter does them each time. I would bring this up to first steps but the reason they are paying for his theripy is because the don't think he can, and I can't afford the therpy on my own. Personally I don't know what to do, but to go along with there digagnosis. I am hopeful they can get Peter talking here soon, and before Justin gets home from training. I do have to say, I am not surprised that he has a speech problem, considering they do run in both my and Justin's family (well Justin has one..).  In everything that has happened the past 3 years, I do feel that I have been deserted by a majority of bugjuice. I am esspecially feeling it now. I keep thinking how things were back in college and how we all have changed. I miss they way we all were then. Lives were so simple then, our biggest concern was what were we going to do that night. I know we can never be the way we used to, but we are still the same people we were then, just older and more mature for the ware. Being deserted bothered me for a long while, but now I don't mind that much. I understand that I am one of the few memebers of the group that has a child, and that the majority of the group is either not ready for that responciblity or does not wish to have that responcibity at this point in there lives. I also have found my self closer to people who share the same burden as my self. It's nice to visit with people who have children, that way you can watch the kids and talk at the same time. I also like that most parents have there homes child proofed so I don't have to worry about Peter breaking anything. I guess I have moved to a different phase of my life that bugjuice isn't ready for yet and I should except that, no one is to blame that we are in different places. Plus besides, I am going to be moving in about 6 months and I will be forced to make new friends at that time. Don't worry, I will keep in touch with as many people as I do now. And if this thing goes well, I will keep this journal up.  Well I feel that is all I have to say for now, but I will keep this going for as long as I can. Till next time....

          Isn’t it interesting that age is truly just a number that shows no reflection or basis of our maturity levels or experience. Like  Phoenix  says some days she just feels older than she is. I think the feeling just comes with experience. But without the experience we couldn’t all be here now could we. Are we all really that old? I know we feel that old, but can’t we do things to make us feel young again? Laughter is a good “keep you young” activity. I thought the quizzes were hilarious. The thought put into some of those questions was unbelievable. I am still having a hard time coming up with my second quiz. It’s hard to ask others questions of yourself. And I am aware that I try to help the wrong people, by the way. But as of late that has not seemed to be my most prevalent issue. I guess I am trying to learn not to do that. Part of the changes I am making in my life.     Phoenix  you are very strong in a lot of ways. You have a lot of roles and you manage them all very well. I especially appreciate the stories you are involved with and how amazing it is that you have the ability to do so. I think that your opinions and insights are valuable to this group as a whole and occasionally tends to keep some of this council sane. This can also be said for  The Voice . Words of wisdom from the voice never fall upon deaf ears. The Voice will call out anyone who wants, asks or needs to be called upon. He has no fear of saying what needs to be said or bringing up what needs to be discussed. As for  Deadpool , you never cease to intrigue me. Linguist, Scientist...What will be next? I have said it before and I will again. "The most polite and dangerous group of people I have ever met." That seems so long ago. A lot of things seem so long ago. But I appreciate the confirmation and the feeling is mutual. (just in case you didn’t already “know” that.)  So all in all I am happy and excited to be a new member in this Council.

        Oh, you know that it is on and popping now    Phoenix .   That stupid Tickle test for our IQ is so off, and we both know it. I took it again, this time I said I was a college graduate, answered exactly the same, and got a 131. Now the first time I said I was a high school dropout and got a 126. I find that extremely biased. But we all know that this Council is smart as well regardless of what anyone believes. We have all proved ourselves to be the best ONE, at one thing or another. You have an intellect like no other, so broad in the range of anything and everything that she can cover or add to any ideas that we have. Kind of like our anchor/sounding board.     The Voice    is a scientific whiz, especially in the field of physics, calculus, trigonometry, and meta-physics. Also one of my oldest friends, that I have only known a short time. That is not as much of an oxymoron as it sounds. Real friends understand that more than anyone else would.    K    is one hell of a people person, and also the newest person to the council. She is quickly becoming the strongest link for this Council, and is someone that I care deeply for, and not just as a friend.      My special gift is people, women in especial. Yes that is grammatically correct. English(American as    The Voice    says,) comes naturally to me. It was set by the college I attended as my minor because of my scores.      "Hang up my playas card..."  The Voice  wrote. I have done it before for less worthy women because I am a scientist at heart, and testing hypothesis about relationships and women. I have not always chosen the right women, but I had to take random samples from the population. Thus the teacher, the college student, the hood rat, the good girl, the freak. Then there are the woman that became the experiments, the rapper, the shrink, the nurse, the doctor(pediatrician,) the accountant, the police officer(now in the Secret Service in downtown St. Lou guarding the reserve,) the army girl(now a Lt.Col,) the married woman(who caught me tripping.) Then, there was the mother, the lesbians(it was a couple,) the twins (though not Japanese.) Then there was Nikki, she was the girl I lost my virginity to (if it can be called that for a male,) and took hers. That was a special hypothesis. It was delving into that bad girl she had become who said she was never into me and was over whatever she felt. That became fun simply because I loved to watch her front when in the presence of "her man." Then breaking down, even in front of her friends at the sight of me biting another woman in front of her. That taught me many things about the female species, especially how to hurt them, nut not to help and heal them. Incredibly smart, sexy, strong, volatile, talented, driven and ambitious being you will ever meet, all willing giving control over themselves, their emotions, and possibly their futures.     This is my message to all women, don't do that SHIT! Please, I need a woman for myself who is self reliant, who will be my partner, not a servant. That is what I have learned from my experiments. So ends the lesson on women. I can't tell you anything about men, they have never rated high enough for me to have an interest in.

      Hello my fellow council members...  please pull up a chair and get comfortable.  We are all friends here... I think.. Anyway, Voice your long informational speech on the roles of men and women was very insightful, but has what to do with anything... Last I checked you were telling Deadpool to face his fears, and then your spouting off about gender roles... I can kind of see how the two are related, but barely.  Now, I am a bird with a small brain, and I am not as intellegent as most (though my IQ score beat Deadpools and K's.. hehehe)  but that speech seem to come out of left field for me, and I am sure even if you did explain it, I would have to turn my head and peck at the seed bell..(I know bird humor.) Anyway, K... Stay as young as you can.  I am 24 and I feel as if I were 40! (lord I am afraid of what 40 will really feel like)  Chucky Cheese is a lot of fun, but go to Dave and Buster's.  It's like Chucky's but with out the stupid animatronics, and screaming kids... Well that's all I have to say here, till next time.  Phoenix

      Yeah so I really Don't know what to say. I am practicing being bored. And I have the occasional Childish day. There is only one place where an adult can truly be a kid. Chuck E Cheese. It was fun. It is time to make adult decisions in life though. Who knows where tomorrow may lead. Better yet why worry. So, the important thing is that I am happy with the decisions I have made and boredum isn't so bad. Plus I will be starting my new job soon so I better enjoy it while it lasts.

       Finally I have taken the time to enter the council.  Sorry about using the 'anonymous' entry method (though I only used it twice! the first anonymous post was NOT from The Voice).  Human time still eludes me on occasion.        In answer to all who have questioned my nature:      No I am not the Creator of All That Is, nor am I His messenger.  The Creator specified that all things must come in pairs--diametric opposites, defining the opposite ends of any spectrum.  For every 'up' there is a 'down', for every 'in', there is an 'out' and for every 'male' there is a 'female'.  In answer to questions that usually are met with only 'silence', there must also be a 'Voice'.        Since the Council seems to have opened on a question regarding the 'male-female' spectrum, it is my intent to enlighten and enliven these particular discussions with a discussion of the nature of 'male' and the nature of 'female'.  Since I would have to say I'm somewhere in between, I'd say I have a unique perspective on the subject, at least worth reading.  It is important to note that somewhere in the fine print of Creation is the subparagraph of law that dictates that outward physical form will always reflect inward nature.  While there are occasional exceptions allowed in this particular subparagraph of Natural Law, something as physically obvious as gender is NOT one of the exceptions.        The nature of 'male':  The physical form that traditionally defines male is the member extending from between the legs.  This member has two functions, both of which reflect a different aspect of 'male' behavior.  The first is that most obvious and frequent of uses:  urination.  In some species, this is a way of marking territory, but in all species, it reflects the general nature of 'male' that his waste product will be deposited casually, wherever he happens to feel the need to get rid of it.  Thus, the internet.  The second purpose of the male member is procreative (okay, okay, I'm talking about SEX!).   Just as the 'male' member must penetrate the woman, in effect violating her physical space in the most personal of ways, 'male' nature is to violate, penetrate, and otherwise dominate all in his path.  'Males' who are incapable or unwilling to exercise this behavior are considered weak and inferior by all, 'male' and 'female' alike, and develop social disorders to match.        The nature of 'female':  It is obvious that the female is the more complicated half of any species, as her anatomy will reflect.  Her urination (expelling of waste) requires much greater planning than her male counterpart, for one thing.  But the real difference is in her sexual nature.  She is the partner who is violated, and as most 'males' will attest, she is not truly happy until and unless she is violated properly.  Oddly enough, it is this one fact that gives her the true control in most human romantic encounters.  Since it is socially unacceptable (to say the least!) to dominate a woman physically without invitation, 'males' are slaves to that permission.  'Females' unwilling or unable to exploit this advantage are considered inferior, and develop social disorders to match.        Having established some basic facts about 'males' and 'females', I can now firmly remind all of you that each of you is one or the other, and if you don't know which you're in big trouble.  Just act the part you were built for and accept that it is your nature, and you should have a fun and happy life.        A note in closing.  I don't make this crap up, so don't blame me if you don't like it.  Truth is truth, whether it fits your personal little view of the universe or not.  If you disagree with my logic, please feel free to enlighten me, but if you attempt to do so by means of a personal attack on my character, you may experience some of that "smiting" mentioned earlier by Deadpool.       Have a nice day!

        You can't be GOD, we don't talk. You definitely are not his messenger, I have met three in my life who could even come close. As for my fears, I fear nothing except dying by the hand of the state by capital punishment. I don't fear death as much as hate the fact that by capital punishment I have no choice of when and how I go out. What I do have is human; anger, annoyance, and confusion. Though confusion can sometimes be fun and interesting, to say the least, you are not confusing. That makes you not fun. That makes you annoying. That makes me angry.        SO PUT UP OR SHUT UP! OTHERWISE PISS OFF!

      Hello All,  I humbly accept being a member of the council, and agree with Deadpool about anonymous postings.... I hate them. If you have something to say then, by george say it. Don't pussy foot around it like I do. (hey I do, too.)  Just say it and be done with it, no one will be offended if you do. We are all members of the council and by now we should know each other well enough not to get that offended. Anyway I have said my peace, to you Deadpool...  Pheonix.

         Council members like Phoenix, and a few others who have joined up since I started this blog a couple days ago, ask highly important questions to ourselves that may affect our rulings or judgements. It is important that we might be able to ask you questions about your feedback on something we wrote. If you are afraid of what we might say, I do understand your fear. For we are mighty and have been known to smite entire assemblies that have come before us with wit and vernacular alone. But, we would like to be able to speak with you and ask you why you give the advice you give, sage or not.

         This is from my bestfriend in the whole wide world. All my friends are family, but this is my little brother born the closest after me, my twin, so we are closer than all the other siblings. He is a little isolated right now and I can't have that. The rest of the family can't leave one of our own high and dry, not at all, not as long as I draw breath!              Hey man whats up havent heard from you in a while,now that I think of it havent heard from Kristene either. Is everybody so busy that they cant drop a line on an old friend once in a while?I mean hey its not like people are activly tring to kill me.....oh yeah thats right THEY ARE TRING TO KILL ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But that is fine I have lived through all the attacks against me with great success,every time I am attacked I kill one of theirs.Go Joetalk to you later........oh and Vince you can share this with all who think that I should "get my ass handed to me"It aint gonna happen,there is not a mother fucker bad enough to take me on and live,for here there are no kid gloves,no pulled punches,this is the real deal and I am the baddest mother fucker in the whole damn vally!         Also, to my and about my little brother Dave, I don't know what the hell happened, but I refuse to let everybody get down on my brother. Suck it up(that means your foolish pride shit) and apologize to the young man. Yes I said MAN because he hasn't been a kid for some years now so everyone face facts. We will all make silly ass mistakes, big and small. Get over it! Friends and close family members are the hardest thing to find. It is like the one diamond that was found half way down the Marianis Trench. It was hell to get there, get it out and go through 18.4 hour of decompression just to have to give it away. That is friends my friends, the rareist and most precious jewel/gem/stone that could be found ANYWHERE. So cherish that shit before I have to bitchslap the lot of ya.                   Peace and a botlle of hair grease.

          This is basically to understand my friend Steve's enjoyment and mental release(therapy) that he said he uses these blogs for. I am not exactly happy with Steve right now, nor Bucky. The reason is silly to other people, but to me it was kind of important. I had been meaning to bring it up to him. But the last to times I saw him we were having to much fun to remember to bitch at him or Bucky about it. I found out recently that I was removed from the bugjuice webpage. If you don't believe me you can check it out, not even an honorable mention in bugjuice, nor was my animal pal.  HE WAS PISSED!   Now you try dealing with a pissed off, nine hundred pound horny gorilla that is pissed off because the rest of his tribe just dissed him. I just took it as an oversight because I was once a prominent(and proud) member of Bugjuice webpage(in no way associated with Disney or Nickelodeon.) So I am writing this so that I can get an answer from them about this deletion of my character from their lives and from being viewed as one of the elite by people who visited the webpage. Besides, my e-mail address,  urlLink entil_zha_council@yahoo.com , means THE ONE and COUNCIL means all my friends are just as special and unique. I made this blog able to receive comments so I expect to get some dammit.

               Anyway people,       this is just a little bit of what is part and parcel to my life right now. My boss and friend got fired, so now my City Supervisor(regional manager for those of us who speak real corporate,) is trying to screw me out of my raise and my promotion. She sent in a new manager, who seems cool for now.          I brought up this subject with him and he definitely seemed interested in making me his asst. manager. He said that the clients that called asked for me by name because they knew I got shit done. He said that didn't gel with what he was told by Melinda(city super) coming in, but he knew some of the clients from where he worked before and trusted their judgment about me. He also said that I was more helpful than the traveller( Dawn) sent by corporate to fire my boss and help him acclimate to Friedman ways.          So now I have my foot in the door again, but to be honest with you guys, the Vinnie man is tired as hell of trying to prove how good he is and getting no reward for it.  THAT IS WHY I AM DIVORCED, NO FUCKING APPRECIATION!  If I wanted that shit I could have stayed married, it would have been less money concerns for me. Also, there is my mother. She is milking her sickness and bacj troubles for all it's fucking worth. Please forgive me for the foul language its just my thoughts. She calls me constantly, that goes double on the weekend, so that I cannot even enjoy my fucking life.          I also have a semi- relationship with a woman. She likes drama so that doesn't sit well with me. Don't get me wrong, she doesn't bring me drama, but needs it in her life. She is the reverse of dramatic, but loves to be in the company of MISERY. I don't get it because she is so fucking cool. Most of my friends that have met her loves her(or at leasts like better than other fuck-pals I have had.) So, like ever I'm sitting around looking for reasons to be mad at her but there really are none. I don't know what I am waiting on, maybe I should just commit and see what happens from there. Let me know what I should do people.
