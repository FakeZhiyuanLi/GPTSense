      I just finished reading G.K. Chesterton's "The man who was Thursday" on sunday.  I think it is possibly among the more thought stirring books I have ever read, especially the following lines "When I saw him from the back, I was convinced he was a devil.  But when I saw his face, I knew he was a God."  It was one of the more powerful lines of the novel, and I won't tell you much more because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet.  I think the most amazing books I have ever read (outside of the Bible) have been mainly fiction ones, that touched my heart rather than the philosophical ones that expanded my mind.  It is quite surprising that these novels are so dear to me considering my own overly cerebral nature.  Ravenheart by David Gemmel, has probably done more for me than Ethics, by Aristotle.  What kind of books are the ones that have made you change your thinking?  Josh

      For those of you who know me reasonably well, you might have known that last thursday was my 23rd birthday. Now I'll admit, it wasn't exacltly the star filled night of enjoyment that I hoped for but hey, you can't have everything. But I did, as I do every year, made my new years resolutions that night because for me, the 19th of august is my new year. I decided to have these as my resolutions:  1.Do a couple of pages of notes or one page of new writing everyday.  2.Actually start wearing the nice clothing that people buy for me, and even experiment with a colour that isn't black.  3.Socialise quite a bit more often.  What do you guys think?  What resolutions have you guys ever made?  Josh

      Ahh, the first post.  The beginning of an era of new thought, revelation and inspiration.  What great new thoughts are lurking in the underbrush of our minds, seeking to be found, dancing before us like snow in the wind?  Or we'll just post in on any old stuff that catches our fancy.  Welcome to my blog, I hope you enjoy it.  I am going to try and post at least a couple of times a week, try to stir some creative juices or just start some fights.   Hope you guys get out and put in!!  Josh
