      Well, There's just one thing i wanna start off with. LIFE SUCKS! it really does. Life is extremely unfair. I wish it creted us with all the same advntages, appearances, and abiities. But, It hasnt, and as a result, Some of us  ae less suited to find a.. Partner. This blog is essentially  A young man's Journey throught the Emotional world which we live in. There is not really a place a to start, but at the beginning... But to this.. Story of sorts, there is no beginning, scince love is an eternal thing. one thig is guess i could start oof with is that, continuing on with my first line, Women are at an advantage when it comes to finding a partner. They don't have to worry about going and asking this person to go out or having to impress them. Relaly, i dont think its about impressing someone, but about getting their attention. you know, for someone like me, considering I'm not that much of a very outgoing person, its ard to get someones atention. And even if i do, i dont really know what to say or do. It just happened. I dont know (Or even thinkO that the person was interested, but i kinda just "Blew' her off.. It's not that i didnt want to talk, but i just didnt know what to say... Its really strange. I hate This. God.... I wish there was a better way to go through this part of my life. I wish that this whole process was simpler. AHHH! LIFE SUCKS! And the way i seem to deal with it is to just escape from it all, Which REALLY does NOT help me with the Meeting and interacting parts of the process. Television, Music, Computer, Books, and sleep ae all ways i use to escape from it.. I don;t know if Roleplaying improves or degrades my social skills.. It would seem that it would make them better, But who knows? Sometimes i dream about this person.. I don't know who they are, but... They aways give me a mixed effect.. Sometimes i feel better. Sometimes not. I remember a dream i had, and after it, I felt like maybe there was a chance of finding someone... And a dream i had lately just made me feel worse. Like... I felt horribly lonely. I just want someone to love, and someone whi loves me for who i am, not what i look like (Not that my looks help or anything like that...) or what i have or wear.(Not much help, either...) I feel so lonely, Like there is noone who gives a Flip about me.. I hate this feeling, yet love it at the same time. Because for a while, these feelings went away. That was a period when i found someone that i "Liked". She was a classmate, but it was a really stupid crush, because i did very stupid things. I handeled it like i was a child, and it was not helpful.... I mean, we didnt have a negative relationship or anything, its just that i didnt handle it like i was a mature "Young Man" or whatever you want to call it... >.> I made a lot of mistakes, And i was Blinded.. I didn't See that this person already had a relationship with someone else.. That really hurt me, The fact that i was so stupid.. God...   Even so, i am glad i had the crush, (BTW, the crush was a realtively short one.. 3 months.) because it made me realize some things. And i wont make those mistakes again. (God.. I hope that person doesnt find this page... X[)  But, in the case that she does, GOD! I am so sorry for  the stupid things i did and said! I was very naieve, and dudnt understand. But thank you for treating me the way you did. You were a great help to me.. Well, back to what i was talking about before.  Sometimes i feel like I'm "In Love" (If i can even begin to know what that feels like.) With my future wife. Even though i  might not have met her yet (If there is even a wife out there for me!) I like to think that she is out there, In love with me too... I know that sounds REALLY wierd and everything, but i want to respect her like i should... I've tried to figure out how I should act, and i hope it will pay off someday...  I really hope there is someone out there for me, and if there is, i hope I'l be the kind of person that they really want. I probably have a lot to learn and a lot of room to grow...  This probably all sounds very Strange, and you might think i am wierd for writing something about emotions, considering i am a guy. But i should go, because my Laptop battery is about to go dead.  If i get this up, Uhh.. Well anyway.. Thats it.  ~Black Sheep~

      Ok. I should probably tell you what this blog is all about. This one, Unlike the other one, will not be dealing with the Physical parts of my life, But the Emotional. Now, I dont expect anhyone to come to this blog, but this post is just in case someone inadvertantly finds their way to this page. This page is meant mostly as a vent for certain emotions and situations.  This is NOT a request for any type of Romantic and/or other type of relationship with ANYONE.  But, If anyone does  want to talk, Feel free to IM or email me.  (The Screenames and Email adresses are in my profile. Now, I may not seen the knd of person to do this type of thing, But, we have to remember that all people have at LEAST  two sides to them. Ok. Now ill probably start my first post... (Don't be suprised!!!)

      Well, I'm sitting here watching "Along Came Polly" With my mom and sister... (Funny, But a sorta chick Flick...) Waiting to watch "Unbreakable"...&nbsp; Well, thats probably enough about the present... Lets talk about what has happened since my last post...  We finally found a house, and moved in. It's only got two bedrooms, but its got a HUGE kitchen and Living Room, and my mom got All-wood floors and a "Mud" room... I didn't really like it in the beginning, but I don't hate it that much anymore, considering there is a possibility we will get Satellite and Cable Internet. (Woot!)  Gah... We finally got our Junk delivered and i got our computer (That has a TV in it) And.. guess what? NO SIGNAL! I GOT STATIC ON EVERY CHANNEL! 69 Channels, and NO SIGNAL! AHHHHHH!! And also, we don't have ANY&nbsp;local&nbsp; internet Access numbers. You know what that means? NO INTERNET! HOW am i supposed to live without INTERNET!?  Answer? I Am NOT!!! NOONE is supposed to live without internet...  Soz i go to the Phonebook to look for a ISP, and theres only like 5.. and 2 of them arent in this area, and 1 of them is WAAAY too much aaaand so i finally get internet after having to do a million chores for my mother (Slavemonger... >.>) Yeah that was today...  Weeel we finally got our appliances... Ahh. life sucks.. But you can read more about that&nbsp; in my other blog... Ahh the cruelties of life. *Sigh*   I thinks me is the bad blogger...   I Iz a gud righter...  Anyway, thats about it...   Thats all i gotta say...   Byebye...   ~Meh~

      Whee. Fun week.&nbsp;  Starting sunday. ( I think that's when i posted last. Im not sure...)  Well...   My mom decided that we were gonna stay in the Motel for a week. Sooo we stayed and saw this new show called&nbsp;'The 4400'. Its a pretty good show! the storyline is great and the acting is nice, and the SFX arent too shabby.  That night i met a few ppl&nbsp;on neopets and through the Blog site.&nbsp; (Ahh, the wonders of the internet. Its B-Yootiful.) And i downloaded some Music. (Bowling For Soup: The Girls All The Bad Guys Want, And Slipknot: Duality. They are Both GREAT songs. Although I've found that the first hasnt been heard by many people before. (Strange!?))   Yeah. Well, Ive supposedly become a "Great" Roleplayer in the 9 months i haven't done it. People have been complementing me! Its really wierd. Its strange what 9 months with a 70-something-year-old english teacher can do to your vocabulary and punctuation.&nbsp; Ahh, how things change.&nbsp;  The week has been pretty fun, I've pretty much getting up whenever I want to, which has been mostly watching TV and Playing Halo Online on the Computer. I also learned about this thing called Modding. Its like where you take a game and change it to what you think would make it more interesting... Its really cool. Yeah. Anyways...  Ohhhh what next? err... OK, Yeah. Like a couple of nights this week ive stayed awayke to watch Adult Swin on Cartoon Network. they have some really good anime (Inu-Yasha, Wolfs Rain, {I know the spelling is wrong, but thats what the show is called!} and Cowboy Bebop. They're Grrrrrrreat! *Does little Tony the Tiger Dance*   Well, we finally found a house to live in and i looks like we're gonna be moving in on monday if everything works out right. (I'll keep you updated)   Let's see... Is there anything else? Ohyeah.   Sunday night My knee started hurting, so i went to ben and the next morning it got worse! It kept getting worse until i couldnt bend or straighten out my knee without EXTREME pain! I couldn't sleep at night. I couldn't straighten out my knee at all. Until i finally got to the Hospital and they tell me i've got "Osgood Schlaughter's Syndrome" It's where this tendon in my knee grew at a slower rate then my knee bones, and It's getting streched when i straighen out my knee! So i have to wait like 3 days before it goes away. (It finally went away last night.)  Yaaay. It's all over. the pain. The Suffering. Ow. Well, anyway, thats pretty much all of it. (What i have to say... -.-;)   THATS IT! iM FINISHED! YOU CAN ALL GO AWAY NOW! (Until my next post, that is...)   I'm off to play Halo! Later, all my fans! (Or flamers... O.o)

      D00d!!!  THIS SUXXORZ!  Well, we got to tulsa today, and, Whoa.. Lemme back up first...  Ok so i go to school last year (2003-2004) and my mom got this "Idea" About moving out to Oklahoma (where the school is.)  Soooooo then one of my friends calls me in his room (dorm) and he tells me That my mom SOLD the house (AHH!) Then, i go home, and i find out that we're moving on the 28th. so we get to the date, and It turns out that SOMEONE at Wells Fargo (the company the guy thats buying the house is getting the loan from) was doing the paperwork, and then Quit. SO noone picks up the Darn paperwork and we end up not closing until July 7th.   So we finally get out of Colorado, and get to OK,(OK city)  and we start unloading the truck. so it takes us like 2 days until we get it unloaded (HUGE truck) Annnnddd we take the truck back to the place where we are supposed to put the truck (After getting lost about 5 million times) and we put all our junk in the car and we start going up to tulsa, UNTIL my mom decides we have TOO much junk in the car. So we have to turn around and drive ALL THE WAy back to the storage facility (Way on the south side of town) and we "unload" a bunch of clothes.   We FINALLY leave OKC and get to tulsa, and we find a sams club and just bum around. THEN, when we're back in the car, My Mom suddenly tells us we're gonna stay at a State Park, Camping. A STATE PARK!!! CAMPING!!! Can you BELIEVE this!?!?!? I'm 16, and i just got out of PRIVATE PRISON school, and I am REALLY tired of being all Roughy and outdoorsey, and i just wanna RELAX and have a FUN summer!!! soooo it looks like im gonna be in a FRICKEN STATE PARK for the next who-knows-how-long and I am stuck WITHOUGT TECHNOLOGY!!! Ok folks, seriously, this may be the last post for a while, unless my mom decides to let us go to some sort of "expensive" place that has electrical outlets. AHHHHHHH! *falls over, shoves a NEON pink pencil into his eye socket and WiGgLeS it around a bit, Stops, and Lies, TwItCHinG on the floor, his mind in semi-retardedness* Agh...gack...eeeeeeeeeee...   Ok ok ok... i see how it could be Sorta, kinda, in-a-kinda-stupid-retarded-boring-as-hell fun.  HAH! YEAH RIGHT! I WONT EVEN GIVE MY MOM THE PLEASURE OF EVEN SAYING THAT!!! nUH-HUH,   NOOO WAY!    But, anywayz, if this is my last post, PLEase dont forget me! and PrAY your little (or Big) Hearts out for me!!!   Just remember me.  L8terzzz!!!!! (hopefully >.>)  ~Adam~

Dude, If anyone calls me an okie, i swear, there are no words to describe WHAT i will do to you... But moving off THAT subject... !       I'm kinda pissed off right now, because My momand sister are watching "OH! Oxygen" network.. (If you dont know, LOOK IT UP, DIPWAD!) But otherwise, everythig isnt too bad. Were in a motel. (A/C, Cable, Nothing to do but watch the cable) And i got a CONTINTENTAL BREAKFAST!!!! (If you dont know, LOOK IT UP, DIPWAD!)      I've Been quite a bad boy while at Home... (Watching movies, TV, Playing Video Games {Onimusha 3: Demon seige ROX!!!}, and "Listning" to music (If you know what i Mean, hehe..

Another thing: I just got an Email fro Juan Carlos , and he told me That Mr. P had His Visa Revoked (jackass!). He didnt go into detail, but he did tell me he was sent back to MX because of it...

       The title? Don't ask. It came out of nowhere for me too. x_x;  well, much has happened since I last posted, and I figured I should probably keep all My beloved fans out there (Which may very well be One person) Updated.   Well, Since I last posted; Whoa! That was a LoNg time ago! :O   Well, School starts a week from today, and considering I go to a Boarding school that has a FiReWaLl on their internet, I shant be able to post (myself) for a while. But fear not! I have thought ahead and found a trustworthy person to post for me! I shall send them the text, and they shall post it. (Kaitlin! Kaitlin!)   I liked it alot, I met a LOT of nice people, Including probably the best friend I've ever had, Bert. But sadly, Bert may not return this year, so I'm crossing my fingers and PRAYING hard that he will come back. It'll be Lonely and strange without him there. ;-;   Anyway; Isn't it Angering how time passes so quickly when you *don't* want it to? I hate that. (Flashback time! :D) I remember those days i worked on Wood crew (At my school we have a 'vocational' program, and every student must work 3 1/2 hrs a day on weekdays, and 4 hrs on sunday. Wood crew was one of the Best AND worst of those Jobs. Slavemongers... *mumble mumble* >.>; )  It was fun at first, Being able to fool around with a 15 lb peice of metal at the end of a long stick. But after the crew got all buff, we started getting tired of the job. It was Tedious, and Mr. Hopper (supervisor) was *always* on your back.  It seemed that those tiny 3 1/2 hours a day turned into etErNiTy. Ah, how I miss those days when you could release your frustrations by splitting a helpless log into a bazillion-gazillion peices, then going to the wieght room afterward to continue working those already strained muxxlez.   Well, I must be off to the Mall, It's time to get some New clotheses! :D:D:D  See you all later!
