      May 27, 2004  Hey guys!  I'm so happy... today is my last day of school!  Yes!  I'm sitting here and I'm beaming I am so happy.  But for every good thing, there's always a bad thing too.  One of my great friends, Brittany, is moving down to Florida.  I'm going to miss her sooooo much and I hope she never forgets me!  I love you, Brittany.  ON A SIDE NOTE... one day until the Day After Tomorrow is released!  I can't wait to go see it... me and Ed are gonna go see it tomorrow hopefully.  Ah, what else is going on today?  Oh yeah... I have to take exams.  Poo.  Exams smell.  Bad.  Especially when I'm taking Bio and Geography.  WHY am I taking those classes?  Surprisingly, I'll miss my teachers too.  And of course the whole "won't see your friends everyday" element sucks, too.  But... no more getting up at 6:30!  I'll miss Mrs. Vacher - I always had a lotta fun in your class.  You always kept me awake. ;)  Mrs. Blom - your class was the one I always looked forward to!  Mrs. Cam - maybe your class was boring, but you weren't.  I loved the insults you'd hurl at the students.  Classic.  Mr. Sandy - the Sandman Cometh!  Oh, Sandy, how I'll miss you.  Those dry humour jokes that you would always tell made me laugh.  Mrs. Scorso - Ah.  Scorso.  Scorso, Scorso, Scorso.  Maybe I didn't like your "harmony of the philosophy", but regardless I'll miss you.  Mrs. Bailey - BAILEY!  BAILS!  THE BAIL MACHINE!  BAIL EM UP!  It's not goodbye!  It's see you later!  Probably at Hardees eating an angus beef thickburger...  Mr. Pinon - You are so much fun, Mr. Pinon.  I'm still praying for Gabe and yourself.  I hope I get you next year.  Anyway, all I have left to do is to close out this blog.  Thank you for reading.  Oh yeah and Ashley... I WANT TO READ OVER AND OUT!  Haha.  Joe & Allen - see ya on the flipside.  You guys are awesome.  To anybody else I forgot... like Hannah, Megan, Megan, Brittny, Dana, Burns, Josh, Chad, Jake, Will, Josiah, Lacy, Peter, Dickson, Dan, Michael, Austin (;)), Charlie, Jared, Andre, Alyssa, Shea, Adam, Rebecca, Potapuff, Katie, Lindsay, Becca and all of my other friends - I love you guys too.  I just don't have enough web space to say bye to everyone.  I love you all and I'll see you guys over the summer.  ~Will~

      This is really a bad day.  One of my very few friends has ditched me.  I invite him over and he just goes "None of your business why, I just can't come!"  SOme people who are just so moody like that just piss me off.  I've had a blast today at my friend's house.  We had a huge water war, in which me and my friend Josh cheated and used water bombs.  Then, we came inside and I kicked butt in Gamecube.  It was all a blast, too bad it's over.  More later.  I've got to leave right now.  I must leave this great scene.  Plus, there's some annoying girl reading over my shoulder named Sarah so I better sign off before she unplugs the computer.

      I'm so happy it's summer!  I officially kicked it off today by going to go see "The Day After Tomorrow".  It was a great movie, but the ending made "Matrix: Revolutions" look good.  One good note today - my friend Brittany isn't really moving to Florida!  Or... at least they're not sure yet.  Oh please... I hope she doesn't move.  I already miss my friends from school, but hey... I've seen most of my friends already.  For those of you that are reading this that know Hannah Roach, I found out today that she actually likes me and considers me a close friend.  Wow.  Anyway, I liked Hannah at the beginning of the year, but nothing really happened between us.  Tonight at the theatre, she had me cracked up with her responses to the tense moments in TDAT.  Edwin had me laughing too with his random comments like "Couldn't you see some guy slam a motorcycle into the side of that building right now?"  I was cracking up.  Anyway, I'll give a better blog update tomorrow for those two loyal readers out there.  Peace out.
