      The bird chirped peacefully in it’s cage.    It was a blue bird, one July had caught out on a camping trip less than a year ago.  She had a thing for blue birds.  Something about their color.  Blue birds, when seen flying, always look peaceful and tend to blend in with nature.  She despised red birds.  She hated seeing them in flight.  Their fast motions and their abundance of color made them an eyesore in her opinion.  They stuck out at you like a flare on the side of the road in the late hours of night.  Blinding you to pay attention.  Blue birds blend in.  Red birds distracted.    It was the color of her world.  Her hate and her love.  She could have cared less about other colored birds.  Yellows, blacks, browns, red crested, and whites were of no concern to her.  Her passion was that of blue and red.  She had accidentally made the machine; her machine.  For being a scientist, she hadn’t been very thorough in some of her note taking and experimenting.  In fact, it was her experimentation that had created the machine in the first place.  Her goal felt simple in the beginning.  She had taken on a bet with Dr. Luiz Fernanad and she was determined to win.  He had studied a lot of her notes that she had written in regards to time travel, teleportation, and the human mind.  In her notes she had clearly calculated that the human mind actually prevented people from creating a time travel instrument.  Her discoveries had been that the human mind was incapable of understanding the way time works, in relation to the Earth itself.  She was quite clear that as humans, we had no real understanding of the way the Earth works, especially in reference to time.  She had listed examples such as not knowing precisely what is in the center of the Earth and also not knowing the exact size of the universe we live in.    With so many unknowns, and no direct way to describe the essence of time, it was clear to her that we have no way of building a time machine until we break down and understand exactly what time is.  Dr. Luiz Fernanad bet her she couldn’t describe or break down what exactly is time.  He practically bet her that it was actually her own mind that was incapable of building a time machine.  But he was wrong.  Over a year ago she successfully sent a flower pot two days into the future.  The pot disappeared from her machine on a Tuesday and reappeared there, at the exact same time of departure, two days later.    In order to thoroughly test the machine though, she wanted to test it on a live specimen.  She was at the pound, buying dogs when she realized that she could not test the machine with a dog.  Her family fondness of the creatures made it too hard for her to justify a test.  If anything happened to the animal, she would have felt nothing but compassion thanks to her childhood.  So, in search of something else that was living and breathing, she had discovered a plant in one of her coworkers offices.    The plant didn’t seem like a real test though.  It had no heart, no mind.  It was, by scientific definition, alive, but it certainly wasn’t as close to a human being as an animal was.  Her first kitten was tested on a Monday.  On Wednesday, the kitten was no where to be found.  After a second test the following day, again the animal was no where to be seen  And thus the coloring of the world made sense.  She had discovered an instrument to rid the world of all the things she hated.  She could save the blue bird population by sending the red birds into the future, never to be seen again.  A year later, her machine was working perfectly.  Not one red bird had reappeared two days later, or at all for that matter.  Her tests were working perfectly.  She had completely stopped working on advancing the machine.  Her bet with the doctor had long been over, but she was more than content on weeding out the scars of society through her machine.  Her only problem was location.  Their department was in such a small town that the sightings and actual availability of red birds was around only one or two a day.  But for every red bird that she sent into the future, she made way for more blue birds.  In the recent days though, she found it harder and harder to obtain red birds for testing.  Moving out of her Idaho home was no problem for her.  In the last year she hadn’t spent much time fixating on her home.  She had spent all her time on the machine.  Her house had become so spare that she only needed three boxes to move.  One box for the machine and two boxes for clothes.  But, sometimes things are too calm before the storm.  On the day that she was going to drive to Boston, leaving her home behind, an old flame of hers showed up on her doorstep.  His name was Alex and they had split up more than two months ago.  Alex wasn’t there for love, he was there for possessions.  He was a material kind of guy and he had heard that she was splitting town.  She still had some things of his and he was determined to get them back.  But, unfortunately for Alex, these items had been dispensed to help pay for the machine.  While Joy tried to explain to him that she just didn’t have his things, he became more and more upset.  Eventually, he forced his way into the home and began searching ruthlessly through the home looking for his belongings.  With his back to Joy, she slowly reached for her machine and aimed it at Alex.  His disappearance not only gave her a feeling of safe, but it also opened up her mind to entirely new possibilities.  She behind her and carried her three boxes out to her car.  She had some relatives that were vacationing in the Pocono’s for the time being and they were allowing her to use their place until she found something of her own.      Her desire to use the machine was like the itch from a bug bite.  Unnoticeable until you accidentally rub or scratch the bite.  And then, no matter how hard you try, the itch just doesn’t go away.  It didn’t take long, even in a big city, for the birds to start running dry.  Within weeks she had used her machine on so many red birds that they were already running scarce.  Sitting alone in her apartment, it didn’t take long for the urge to itch the bite that Alex left in her.  She thought about his disappearance almost every day.  The mailman was her first, and overall the easiest.  He would stop by every day and deliver her mail, and all it took was a simple invitation into her home one day.  He didn’t even notice the machine on her counter and he certainly didn’t notice it aimed right at him.  It had all started with birds.  With Alex and the postman out of the way, July began to call other ex-boyfriends to her new home.  Within a months time she had made over ten ex-boyfriends disappear without any work whatsoever.  She found it amazing how relaxed it made her feel.  Her last and only real challenge was a boy she knew from college.  They had dated only a short time but he had cheated on her just about every day they dated.  She had spent many long nights thinking about what could have been had she not found out about his side relationships.    She invited him over for an outside brunch.  She set up a nice meal of fruit and dessert on her picnic table outside.  The machine was no more than two feet away, resting on her side porch.    Justin arrived right on time.  He looked so different than he did in college.  It was amazing to her how men let themselves go once they hit a certain age.  It’s so rare to see one keep himself in shape past the age of twenty-three.    He sat across from her on the picnic table.  His back was to the machine.  Things couldn’t have been more perfect.    But, even though her setup was perfect, there was one thing that didn’t seem right: Justin.  He had been so rotten to her in college and now, having him here, he couldn’t have been sweeter.  She had noticed his physical change in appearance, but, she wasn’t expecting his change in attitude.  She found herself lost in some of the things he was saying.  So lost she managed to put the machine out of her mind.  Maybe Justin wasn’t one of the bad ones.    It was no accident that she saw the blue bird.  She loved them, everything about them.  It was red birds that distracted her mind, but it was blue birds that soothed her.  She did however, take too long to notice that it was the machine the blue bird came to a rest on.    She moved quickly to shoo the blue bird away.  It’s position shifted when she came close, but, it shifted the wrong way.  It’s tiny feet stepped so slightly onto the machine’s button.  It’s small weight was just enough to trigger the machine.  In the blink of an eye, Justin watched her vanish.  It was if only a minute had passed.  Green trees, grass, and large open spaces were almost all that laid in front of her.  The sky was a bright blue with gorgeous clouds overhead.  Streaks of red distracted her though.  Sitting in trees, flying through the air, nesting everywhere.  She couldn’t look anywhere without seeing many, many red distractions.  On the grass sat many, many men.  It was a chain reaction of head turning.  One by one her ex-boyfriends noticed her standing there.

      I have no idea who is actually reading this thing, but, to anyone who is, Sunday's are my slow days at work.  I was at work for nine hours today and maybe had 10 customers.  It's pretty boring working by myself on Sundays.  Next Sunday is the 4th of July and I'm pretty bummed.  I think it is the most romantic holiday ever (even more so than Feb 14th).  There's just something so romantic about sitting underneath the stars and watching some of the neatest explosions ever in the night sky, with your girl on the ground beside you.   It's like the night just has a way of sucking you in.  I guess you could blame it on the stars.  It's the one night that you are forced to look above and notice how amazing the stars and the sky is.    I wish I had someone here to spend it with, someone I was actually close with or wanted to be close to.  I decided to start posting my stories.  I want to use this space as an excuse to make myself write more.  Who knows, maybe someone will read something and like it and actually be interested in coming back every once in awhile.  I must admit now though - my stories can be strange sometimes.  Anywhere from moving, depressing, or shockingly cool.  I try my best to floor my audience with the whole "wow" factor and well, I hope it works.  Either I'll get a "wow" out of you or I'll get a "freak...".  Either way, you read it:)

      Aight.  If anyone out there even reads this, I've been insanely busy.  I'm working 45-50 hours a week, which for me isn't too bad because to be honest, until one week ago, I had jackcrap to do in my life, outside of work.  But, now some things are going on in my life and I feel like things are just sorta running on full steam with no reigns or anything to take control of.  Carpe Deim(sp?) is running my life right now and for that I am thankful, but also busy.  Life is good though.  I'm tired all the time but for all the right reasons.    I'm in the middle of watching this movie called Ordinary Decent Criminal.  Thus far it's been pretty good to me, but, critics online call it garbage.  Not sure what beef they had with it, but, I'm diggin it.  Okay, off for now.  I have a road trip to go on and am crossing my fingers that it doesn't suck the donkey.  Now, say the word "doom" outloud and add a "y" to the end.  :)

      Starving for the thing that matters most I close my eyes and blind myself from the light In front of me is a mirror of glass I cannot see it, but it can see me  I strain my eyes to see what isn’t there The lids closed down around them and blackness subdued In front of me is a mirror of glass It reflects my faults, and my strengths  Bent on finding a meaning for existence My eyes fill with buds of light and creation becomes blinding In front of me is a mirror of glass But inside my mind is a black hole of hope  I do everything I can to focus the darkness I rub my eyes to change the direction of each puzzle of light I stand in front of a mirror And with my eyes closed, only I can see my true reflection

      If the only way I have to remember her by is her face, Then count me blessed numerous times over. In my wildest dreams I always feared That one day a love like this, Would come and ruin my heart  I met her in a place unknown A place where only dreams are possible and love is imagined. But not in the physical realm, but that in the world Where horses fly, marriage is forever, and dreams are made Our eyes met several times that night   Staggering backward, against all that held me down I traveled to that place unknown and broke rules like never before Her beauty is best described in my ugliness For there it last in eternity and there is where I feel perfect Her beauty is external to the naked eye But to the trained heart her soul is more beautiful than Heaven’s first sunrise

      Betrayer of Emotions By Matt Wehner   Hearts broken and confused Smiles gone awry like always before Supposedly different But it is always the same  Some things are meant to be broken Some things are meant to change My love; my life I shatter my own hope  Tears of love and lust I cry  They burn my face and melt my eyes I cared so much Like fate though, I get crushed  Trapped in a river of unhappiness I bar the door and swallow the key I need to be strong But my thoughts betray me  With fist of rage I hit myself Thoughts of pain; I pull my own trigger A fake world An even faker smile

      A Man and His Heart By Matt Wehner                   I cannot think of something as gracious as a heart,  Beating only for one person, --a true art,  God has blessed fortunate souls time and again,  He’s made complete strangers, perfect friends,   But this is a story of a heart simple and plain,  That wishes it only to be reunited again  With it’s other half, another heart, separated at life,  Just like brother from sister, man from wife,                        This heart has begun the uncomfortably long trip,   A soul started hunt, by a crack of a whip  The adventure has begun, a race to end all  A timeless story that begins in the fall,   The man was uncertain over a lack of love  The one he had found, turned into a fallen dove,  Seeking again he desperately knew that this time  He had to find the right woman to share this rhyme                        As he started to look through all thick and thin  He noticed his life had almost reached perfect again  He had friends all over the place; it was almost like fate,  But the heart was not happy; it needed a mate,   So the man looked more and more and more  And tried to find something that his heart would adore,  When low and behold one winter night  He met a woman, made of spirit and light   The two were friends almost right away  They shared a few calls during night and day  For months they grew stronger and tighter together  But alas, they needed more time with one another   Each day with her the man enjoyed more  While the heart needed something to beat for  The phone calls weren’t enough for the heart  He wanted to do more; he wanted a part                        In the life that this man was creating  The heart was forgotten about—kept waiting,  It grew upset in the late evening mist  All it wanted was to love and to be kissed                        So it created a plan that was not on the usual route  Of a heart needing someone to brag about  It made up it’s mind and made the decision  To do everything it could to get the woman’s attention                        It even led the man to what he wanted most  An evening with the woman to which he could host  They met at his house where he cooked dinner  And that night just maybe the heart would be a winner   As the late hours at the man’s home raced on  The heart now wished her never to be gone  It enjoyed her company and wanted to meet  The one he hoped would be so nice and sweet   And then the time came and the woman said   “I really must go” but into her eyes the heart read  She wanted to stay longer, it knew she had been won  But surprisingly the man said “I understand, go on”   Disappointment shattered the in-love heart  All it wanted had left, but he had done his part  Furious with the man, the heart tried to understand his actions  The man just smiled and thought “there’s more than attractions”   At this the heart was made to think and think  But reached no conclusion, which made the heart sink  So again the man’s actions he had to explain  He said “Listen here heart, and I’ll tell the master plan”   This plan was told into the late hours of night  The heart now excited and its warmness grew tight  The anticipation grew more and more until the following week  When she was asked over again in meek                        He made dinner again, well, tried his best  And at the right moment, he put his heart to the test  He reached into his tiny pocket and removed an object  A box that made up the man and heart’s major project   The man asked the question and the woman screamed “Yes”  The heart was so excited it became a beating mess  It swelled up so big it flew circles inside the man’s body  But this was all to be expected from such a long journey   A few more months later and the heart was now happy  The day arose and the man and woman were married  They moved to the city to an apartment together at last  Where everyday just moved by way too fast

      Well, I'm still alive.  I've been pretty dead for the last week though.  On Tuesday my district manager yelled at me a lot.  I had to do a store inventory and it went to crap on me.  I worked from 7am to 10:45pm that day.  Can we say sucky?  She was mad cause I was making mistakes, but, I'm new and should be allowed just a few mistakes.  It's a learning process for me anyway.  I'll get it.  So, my day off was Wednesday, got called in for three hours to fix some pc stuff that got messed up.  Then I had to work Thursday as well, which, sucked equally.  Then, Friday and Saturday I had to spend up in Iowa opening a new store up there.  It's cool to feel important, sucky to be left to open a store on your own:)  But, I felt like a business-man.  I was traveling and stuff, stayed in a hotel my company paid for, etc.  Was a nice feeling.  But, now I'm back.  I got to watch Butterfly Effect last night and while I found it entertaining, I just was left a little disappointed.  It's so frustrating for me to watch Hollywood movies just sorta run at half speed.  People don't care about anything other than making money.  I remember when acting used to be an art, not just a paycheck.  It's so hard though, I mean, even De Niro has sold out (cough, Meet the Parents, cough).  Where's the honor and prestige that used to be held for writing and acting?  Now all we care about is who's having sex with J. Lo.  I should have another story up tomorrow.  I'd love to turn one of my stories into a flick, but, you have to have money first.  Horrible cycle = person mad at Hollywood because Hollywood makes movies now only to make money, so person wants to make a movie to defy Hollywood's ideas/filmmaking, but person has no money to make film with.  Sigh.
