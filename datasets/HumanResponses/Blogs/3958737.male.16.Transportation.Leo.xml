      I've started driving on my own recently, and I've noticed how bad traffic really is.&nbsp; My parents say it looks like what downtown Portland used to look like 25 years ago.&nbsp; It's absolutly crazy.&nbsp;   I read an artical in The Columbian the other day saying by&nbsp;2005 (or 6, can't quite remember), every city (with the exception of Yacolt, heh heh) in Clark County&nbsp;will be expanding and recieving almost double the traffic of what they are seeing now.&nbsp; The article also says that Vancouver and Battle Ground will see the most change.  That's insane.&nbsp; I cannot imagine driving in worse traffic than what we have now.&nbsp; Then again, we'll all be in College (except for Felix, that lazy bum.), so I guess it doesn't really affect us.  &nbsp;

      I think welfare is a system of total CRAP. Here we are, spending our hard earned money for taxes, taxes which go to programs like welfare, promoting the American way of life (sucking the blood outta the guys who've got cash!)&nbsp; &nbsp;  Though the concept is novel, people out there are vampires! Though I don't think that we should totally wipe it off of the face of the USA, much like a smudge on the face of a hugely fat baby, there needs to be definite change.  &nbsp;  I'll be first to admit it, and I don't know much about the program, besides that it hands out money and food stamps (do they still have those?) to lazy-ass "citizens" who do nothing but drink booze and have babies, so they can get more welfare! Though I'm sure there is a silent minority that actually needs it, like families on hard times, there is the overly disgusting majority (I think it's a majority) that suck our blood and wallets  dry , just living off it!  &nbsp;  What I want to see are stricter time limits, huge background checks, and checks on the recipients that come often, to look at progress. The program probably has these already, not too sure, but if they do, I'm thinking they aren't strict enough!  &nbsp;  Correct me if I am wrong on any of these facts! Let's see some blood spilt!

      This topic is bound to come up eventually, so we might as well get it out of the way now. &nbsp; What is your favourite kinds of music at this moment? &nbsp; How about this,&nbsp; Favourite Type of Music, Favourite Band(s), Favourite Song.&nbsp; Note: They don't have to be the same. &nbsp; For me, it would be:&nbsp; Classic Rock, Aerosmith, Dust in the Wind(Kansas)

       Okay, time to lay down The Law.  &nbsp;  1. Keep profanity at a minimum.&nbsp; Please refrain from using it if you can while arguing.&nbsp; I guess you could use it to make a point, but it does kind of take you away from the opinion. 2. Racial/Sexual/Homosexual slurs will not be tolerated.  3.&nbsp;No name calling&nbsp;unless you're intending it to be friendly.  4.&nbsp;Do not post an opinion without reasoning if you hope to discuss it.  &nbsp;  If you follow those simple guidelines, I have no beef with you.   &nbsp;  -Praise or Haze-  &nbsp;  I've developed a good way to make a fun arguement when you want to.&nbsp; If you chose to make&nbsp;a topic in which you can post something that you want people to argue with you or say how much it sucks or something, put "Praise/Haze" in the title.&nbsp; Simple.&nbsp; Deliciously simple.

      I don't really see why we need people to critique movies and things. I don't see what significance they have. Different people look for different things in movies and music, so how can we have one person saying what's good and what's bad about movies and junk? I missed the boat on that one. This topic sucks. Blah blah cookies.

      Let's ask a better question.&nbsp; &nbsp; How long does everybody think Felix will live after questioning the power of an opinion board? Any predictions on what might happen?

      How long does everybody think this will last? Any predictions on what might happen?  &nbsp;  I don't want to be negative, but I think this won't go on for long, as it needs to be a highly collaborative project, and with one or two people slacking off, it'll be more reliant on the few people who do actively post. The crevice will get further larger, until we all forget about this.  &nbsp;  But the future is bright and all etc. etc.  &nbsp;  I was going to end my first post with my highly offensive and politically incorrect assessment of all races of the world, but I was forbidden. Impedement of my free speech.  &nbsp;  Since when was this&nbsp;thing a&nbsp;FASCIST STATE? HM?

      I asked it once before on my other blog, and I'll ask again. &nbsp; Nintendo DS or the Sony PSP? &nbsp; I'm partial to the Nintendo DS, soley for the first party games.&nbsp; The PSP is pretty sexy, though.

      I really likes socks. To me, they are the most efficient, comfortable, portable and affordable way of keeping your feet dry, clean and blister-free. Not only that, but theyare multi-functional! For one, you can make sock-puppets. And another thing! You can make sock-monkeys. Also, you could use them as a wind-sock. I tremble in fear to think of what the world would be without socks.
