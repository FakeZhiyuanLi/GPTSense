      Is simplicity best or simply the easiest?   So begins  urlLink Depeche Mode 's " urlLink Judas Song " (off of Songs  urlLink of Faith and Devotion ).  I am thinking of this song now, while  urlLink Jimmy Eat World's  " urlLink A Sunday " is playing on repeat. (whew, I have to say that this thought maybe a bit disjointed because it took for-fucking-ever to hyperlink those suckers.  I tried to find lyric pages that didn't have a shitload of pop-ups, but the web is just flooded with them it is really fucking annoying and yes, I have a pop-up blocker).  Anyway.  So I am listening to one of the most depressing songs ever.  And trust me I know depressing songs. And I am thinking back to my sophomore year of high school, listening to "judas song" in my basement and staring at my oversized poster of depeche mode and being sad and alone like your typical nerdy teenager.  And yet, that is actually how I feel right now. Sad and Alone.  the only difference between now and then is that back then I didn't long to smoke in bed and drink tequilla.    Life would be simpler if I didn't obsess over the most absurd details of my mundane existence.  Life would be simpler if I could forget about Mr. David.  Life would be simpler if I could learn to live alone, if I could be happy practicing guitar five hours a day and reading and drinking alone.  And probably even simpler if I left out the drinking part.  But would it be better?   urlLink The Descent of the Dove .  It's a book a priest loaned me once.  It discusses the two paths to god.  Negative: Abstaining from the physicality of the world so as not to be distracted by it.  Positive: Embracing the physical and finding God in all its aspects.  Williams makes no distinction between either method, both are equally valuable in theory.  But in practice one should not because more concerned about the path than about the destination.  Like anything abstention can lead to fanatical deprivation and involvement can lead to overindulgence.      None of this is anything new or interesting, I know.  But it seems somehow relevant to my life right now.  I don't think I can abstain from depression, but I certainly don't have to revel in it.  Which is what I am doing.  I know that I am bruising my soul, perhaps scarring it even.  But I can't seem to stop myself.    The haze clears from your eyes on a sunday.  on a sunday. What you wish for won't come true. Live with that.  Well, I don't want to live with that.  I want things to go my fucking way, god damnit! I think I am having an electric temper tantrum.  Fuck you MR. David.  Despite all my craziness, which, honestly, happens out of your site, I am really fucking cool.  I am smart (despite the lack of eloquence in these posts) and I am funny (actually funny, not just poop-humor funny) and I am compassionate and caring, but not nice and boring, and I am fucking good at fucking and I am loyal and trust worthy. I think outside the fucking box and don't  rebel just be to a non-conformists like all the other non-conformists.  God damn it david. What the fuck is your problem?  Do you think some 20 year-old  girl  is going to fly across the country to live with you in that shitty little new england town we go to school in?  Do you think she is going to follow you around for years while you pursue your career?  Or do you really think the two of you can manage a 3000 mile long distance relationship for the next four-seven years while she gets her PH.D. (because honestly, what else is a history major supposed to do?)  Yeah, fucking right.  She'll dump you before she turns 22.  Trust me.  It's nothing against her.  She's just young. That's all.  And that's what girls do.     Yeah, yeah, I know I am only 23. But fuck. you're twenty-fucking-six.  There's six years between the two of you and only three between you and me.  And we are both in grad school together and there was a reason you dumped her in the first place? REMEMBER?! she was too young and she couldn't commit.  Do you think six months will change that? Well it won't.   You should call me, you piece of shit.  You should call me and fall for me and make everything okay again.    What you wish for won't come true.    Fuck. I hate it when I sound like this.  Fucking Trite! That's what all of this is.  I have a clear recollection of walking down the street in my hometown.  I was 16, I was hanging out with a friend of mine, a 15 year-old boy.  He started ranting about something or other and I started thinking:  Everything he says has been said before, and in a more eloquent and powerful way.  He sounds just like every other pissed off, isolated and angst-filled teen.  And then I thought: My God! I must sound like that too.   Well damnit.  It sucks to be going through all this emotional melodramatic shit and not even be able to talk about it in an interesting/beautiful/powerful/moving way.  I am so fucking jealous of all of those assholes who can just pick up the guitar and pound out an emotionally driven song, or those fuckers who can just pick up a pen and compose a poem or easy.  Yeah, yeah, I know. You have to  practice  , you have to keep reading, writing, editing.  But let's face it.  Effort only gets you so far without talent.   Okay. Well  that  was attractive, wasn't it?  Sigh.  At least it's better to do it here so I can more easily maintain my facade of calm cool collected detachment.  Okay. no more ranting. time to smoke.

      Every morning the weather tricks me.  I have yet to learn how to tell whether the morning's clouds will burn off into a magnificant sunny afternoon or whether they will gather strength and rebell against the LA hordes who wear too-bright clothing and ridiculously high-heeled open toed shoes. Sigh.  They call this june gloom, but let me tell you, this is nothing compared to the annual rain festival that Seattle holds from October to May.  I like seattle, but I must admit I don't miss the overcast skies and chilling damp.  Except that sometimes, like right now, I do.  I haven't seen rain in a long time and the mood that I am in calls for it.  I want to hear the rain smack against my window pain.  (Note to self: move guitar away from the window with the fan in it just in case it rains while I am work).    Depressing thoughts for the day:  1) Mr. Rod still has not returned my e-mail 2) Mr. David still has not returned my phone call (I left a voicemail saturday afternoon). 3) Mr. Shahin however did call tonight and I didn't return his phone.  Honestly I didn't get it until 11pm. Still I knew he would be up and I didn't bother calling. 4) If Mr. David had called in a similar circumstance I would have returned his phone call. Therefor, Mr. David feels the same way about me that I feel about MR. Shahin.  IE, ambiviliant.    I suppose #3 is not a sound inference, still the thought is haunting.  Despite my exhaustion last night I could not sleep. Why? Because I kept imagining what life will be like next year without Mr. D.    More Depressing thoughts:  5) Darbi's boyfriend-type-person, Larry had a stroke.  A bad Stroke. And larry is only 30.  This is bad for Darbi, which means it is bad for me.  Because, as I said in a previous post, Darbi is one of the COOLEST people on the entire planet.   6) We are all going to die, some of us sooner than others and those that don't die face the risk of permanent disability or deformity.  DE-fucking-pressing.  I don't want to die, I don't want to be deformed and I don't want to get old.  I like the illusion that I will be young forever, and I am not too happy to be reminded otherwise  In other news.  I was at a Firm event.  One of the partners hosted dinner at his house.  It was an amazing beautiful house, trophy wife, good help and dreadfully boring conversation.  I was sitting next to steve, who I used to think was okay, but now I think is just a big dork.  Mormon straight-edge dork, that is. Actually, I don't mean dork, I mean arrogant morally superior "nice" guy.  The only thing of note is that Steve grew up in Salt Lake City.  Okay, I know he is straightedge, but I had to ask: "so do you remember that band,  urlLink PCP berzerker ?"  He could tell from the tone of my voice that I thought rather highly of the band so he was polite in his answer.  Yes, he knew of them.  What he was thinking was probably, "yeah, they're a bunch of alcohol and drug users, like I would listen to anything like that.  I like the  urlLink newsboys !"  I might have left at that but I said, "yeah I am friends with most of the band members."  He just said, "oh yeah. that's cool." What I was thinking was, "Yeah, no shit it's cool.  Rod, Eric and Bryan are only like three of the most FUCKING cool people on the planet, so DAMN STRAIGHT, you mother-fucking-straight-edge-stuck-up-dick is it cool."  Anyway, that's eric in the photo (if you bothered to click on the PCP berzerker link) not Rod.   Anyway, I'm being to harsh on Steve.  He actually seems like a nice guy.  And he never mentioned that he was straight edge, or that he was mormon for that matter.  I just assumed so because 1) he did mention that he doesn't drink and 2) he attends  urlLink BYU  law school.  He actually seems like a nice guy.  I am just in a hostile mood.    I am also really exhausted. so I am going to go to bed.

      Yeah, I know it's "sheets" but after last night, I think "shots" is more appropriate.  Tequilla is both my new best friend and my new worst enemy.  So I went out with MR. Vince's roommate, MR. Shahin, again.  I cannot recall if I have entered MR. S into my blog yet, so let me catch you all up.  MR. V is out of the picture.  I scoped out the vince vibe for the last couple of weeks and there's nothing there.  Which I am fine with.  Honestly.  His roommate, however, is pretty into me.  I always hate saying that because it sounds so egotistical.  Plus, I am terrified of rejection so the minute I state that Mr. X is interested in me, the minute I open myself up to the pain of rejection if it turns out that Mr. X is not interested.  But it is true, Mr. S digs me.    The only problem is that I can't tell if I actually dig him, or if I am just bored.  I mean I like him as a person.  He's very funny, smart, nice, etc.  Maybe he talks a bit too much, but that's hardly a complaint that I have any right to make considering how much I talk.  His other problem is that I think he tries too hard to be cool. Another complaint I shouldn't be making.  After all, that's the story of my life: pretending I am something other than I am.    But after four shots of tequilla, I thought, hey why not? So I kissed him the middle of the bar.  It was worth it just to see the look on his face.  However, this sort of thing can be a very dangerous game to play.  Luckily I am out of this town in two months so I don't think the risk is too great.  That might have sounded egotistical too. oh well.  One of two things usually happens with the guys I date.  1) I fall madly in love with them and they dont' feel the same or 2) they fall madly in love with me and I don't fell the same.  Actually, come to think of it, the latter has not really happened.  I did dump MR. Leonard, Mr. Kaleb and Mr. Mike.  But I think in every case the boyfriend knew that the relationship had been over for some time and had just refused to admit it.  The former situation has happened exactly twice (MR. Andy, Mr. David).  And then there was the MR. Rod situation in which we both felt the same way but staying together was an impossibility.    BLah blah blah.  Sometimes I bore myself to death with my own writing.  In fact, I am so boring right now that I am going to do something mindless like update my profile.

      A half-hour of my life erased in two random key strokes.  It's three o'clock on a sunday afternoon and I am still in bed.  Thirty minutes ago, I wrote, "it's two-thirty in the pm and I am still in bed."  Thus began a rather lengthy post that was erased only two minutes ago by some mysterious combination of key strokes, which I have yet to understand.  It's funny that I should consider that half-hour wasted as much of that post was spent saying that I had abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do today.  I was so annoyed when I couldn't recover the lost text that I actually got out of bed, relieved my strained bladder and attempted to take a shower.  There was, however, no hot water.  So here I am back in bed. Writing in my blog again.  I wish I could smoke.  But that would require getting dressed and going down to the corner market, as I am fresh out of smokes.    I don't really feel like reconstructing the lost-post, which is too bad, because it had some wry observations concerning the nature of sundays, the odors of ex-boyfriends, and the mis-ordering of items on my list of priorities.  Sigh. I really don't have much else to write though.  I hate sundays.  I always have.   Well, maybe the hot water is working now.  I suppose I should go investigate.  Two quick things before I go.  1) some one posted comments.  Actually two someones.  that was pretty cool.    2) it's weird to think of parents as people.  a lot of blogs that I have been reading lately are the personal diaries of parents.  But not parents, qua parenting, but rather ordinary people who happen to be parents (see, e.g.,  urlLink fire on the lawn ).  I guess I know that my mother and father have lives outside of their relationships with my brother and me, but it's weird to think of them swearing, or discussing their lost ambition, or frustration over writer's block, etc.  Of course, if I ever have kids I don't plan on sacrificing  my  identity, though my children will, of course, become incorporated into that image of self.  But still, it trips me out a little bit, because I have a heard time viewing my parents from a perspective other than the perspective I see as their daughter.  Perhaps that is because I would never want them to see me as a I see myself.  I have a very carefully groomed image that I present to them. It has just enough flaws to make it seem real, but not enough to tip them off to the troubled self that lies beneath.  Perhaps they do the same thing.  My mother, in fact, was on prozac last year, or so I believe.  I am not sure if she was seeing a counselor because she didn't discuss it with me.  I myself was seeing a counselor at The Law School, the result of a near nervous breakdown and a month of insomnia.  I have not (yet) managed to get a prescription for prozac, but I do have sleeping pills.  I think I will start back up with counseling when I get back to school and try to get some anti-depressants though.  I  oscillate on whether or not I really need them, I probably don't, but I have to admit I am extremely curious.  Anyway, the point of bringing that up is that I didn't tell my mother about my problems either.    okay.  time for a shower. I really don't smell very good.

      Why is it that I can never find what I'm looking for?   In life, in love, in my fucking room.   I am getting ready to go out to a party tonight and I am nice and burnt.  Why? Because I couldn't find my sunscreen today.  And like an idiot I thought: I'll just go to the beach for a couple of hours, I can't burn that quickly. Well, guess what, yes I can.  I was online checking out other people's blogs. And I looked up and saw the suncreen sitting on my desk right out in the open.  Just thought I would tell you all that (you all, of course, being no one at all).    Anyway.  Here's a blog I liked:  urlLink http://karolewrites.blogspot.com  maybe I just liked it because she is a new blogger and her's is sort of a personal diary like my own which doesn't seem to have a lot of readers (i only say that because there are no comments posted).    Also, I forgot about the following website and recalled it for no reason today.  I find it highly entertaining:  urlLink http://emotioneric.com   okay. that's it for now.

      	Rod or Blog, rod or blog?   I’ve been so busy the last couple of days I haven’t written to either and now that I have free time, I am faced with a dilemma, rod or blog?  So I will compromise.  Some of this material I will send to both.  I hope that doesn’t cheapen the content.  After all, the best letters create a private, intimate space; the letter writer simultaneously conveys both a sense that she set aside a good amount precious time out of her busy life, just to write just to you and that the lost time can hardly be considered a sacrifice since since she cares for you so greatly that she couldn’t possibly not write to you.  Blogs, at least the online-diary types like this one, are, for the most part, public glimpses into isolated anonymous lives that choose to write to the world only in the hopes of finally feeling at home in it. 	Anyway, where should I begin?  Probably by describing Mr. Rod.  Let’s back up 13 months ago.  I was DEVESTATEDLY (I didn’t mean intend to type that in All-caps, but sometimes my capslock button goes psycho and turns on or off by itself, which it is doing right now.  Anyway, it came out allcaps, and I decided I liked the way it looked so I kept it) in love with and heart broken over an emotional fuckwit named Andy.  Mr. Andy, is the original fuckwit, call him fuckwit #1, or just #1 for short.  I won’t go into the story of #1 right now (incidentally, my keyboard is going all crazy; the cursor is jumping everywhere, the capslock is going on and off, random sections of text are being highlighted—this makes it very difficult to type).  The point is that I was heartbroken.  It was also the birthday of my friend, Bryan.   I met Bryan’s roommates for the first time at his birthday dinner (I guess he is too old for parties in his mind): Devon, Eric and… Rod.  Devon hit on my shamelessly.  But he reeked of being a player and of, well, he just plain reeked in the literal sense.  Eric fussed with his girlfriend, who I don’t think liked me very much.  And Rod and I got into some argument over music.  It wasn’t really an argument from my perspective, but I think he was actually offended and obviously did not care for me.  Fast forward a couple of weeks later when Andy and I finally broke up (after a long, drawn out process of fighting, him avoiding me, me nearly stalking him and then giving up completely and dumping him).  The night of the break-up I drank a half-bottle of codine cough syrup, three long island ice teas and ended up nearly passed out in devon’s rat’s nest of a bed room.  He kept trying to put his hand my skirt, I would let him get only so far before I mustered up the strength to push his hand away.  I wouldn’t kiss him because I had thrown up earlier in the evening. Eric had been kind enough to give me  a new toothbrush, but still, vomit is vomit and I didn’t feel like kissing anyone after that.  Also, as good looking as devon is, he is still really gross (like an unkept, unbathed trent raznor, or whatever that guy’s name is, the one from NIN).  I think devon and I went out on one more occasion, though we never did anything more than kiss (though, I found out later that he answered his roommate’s inquiries in such a fashion as to give the impression that much more had happened, without having to actually lie about it). Anyway…  Rod and I ended up hanging out with our mutual friends, Darbi  and Bryan a couple of times.  Darbi, by the way, is one of the COOLEST chicks EVER.  Actually, she is one of the COOLEST people EVER, but because there are far fewer cool chicks than there are cool men, that fact that she is so fucking cool and a chick makes her even fucking cooler.  Anyway.  Speaking of cool, I liked Rod from the first time I laid eyes on him.  He dresses in such a ridiculous fashion—black shoes, black socks, cut-off plaid pajama pants, a black t-shirt, and overshirt, a fucked up leather jacket (victim of a knife-fight) and huge, oversized, 99-cent sunglasses—that it is fucking cool again.  I hope he doesn’t think I am making fun of him when he reads this, because I am not.  I think he dresses Super-sexy.  But it took rod a little bit of time to warm-up to me.  I remember one night at darbi’s when I dragged him outside to smoke.  I couldn’t tell if he was flirting with me in a very dry subtle way or if he was just messing with me, because it was obvious that I liked him (I know now that it was the latter).   Anyway, fast forward again a couple of weeks later. Saturday night: I didn’t want to be alone.  So I called bryan up, told him I was picking him up and taking him out for drinks.  I have to admit, that I was also hoping that I could get rod to come along. It was surprisingly easy to do; I walked into rod’s drink, asked him along and told him I was buying. Since rod is an alcoholic (an honest-to-god one, not one of those fake alcoholics who think it’s cool to proclaim their weakness, alcoholic buwkoski-wannabes like me), he accepted.  Rod and Bryan were on one side of the table, I was on the other.  Two drinks later when bryan got up to use the bathroom rod decided to sit next to me.  It was a loud bar ( urlLink the bad juju lounge , one of the coolest bars in seattle) he kept leaning in to talk to me.  The next thing I know, I asked him if I could kiss him and then I didn’t wait for an answer.  Bryan, of course, came back and did not look too happy to find my tongue down rod’s throat.  I suppose I can’t blame for being annoyed.  After all, two weeks earlier, there had been a similar scene with Devon.  But rod, unlike devon, is not a player, and I think bryan was a little concerned that I was just fucking around with rod’s head.  Well, bryan left shortly thereafter and Rod walked me back to his place.  I’d like to say that I was really fucking cool about the whole thing, but I wasn’t.  I was an emotional wreck and I was alternately crying about andy, and pathetically giddy because rod was actually showing an interest in me.  And I ended up nearly naked (think I kept a black thong on), in rod’s bed, making out with him and trying not to let things get too out of control.  This story is already way too long, so I will try just to summarize the rest.  That night was the beginning of the greatest and shortest love affair of my life.  No exaggeration, though of course it must seem like one, because I am only twenty-three and the affair only lasted six weeks.  But fuck whatever one else says, I was in love with rod (probably still am) and it was the most passionate, crazy six weeks of my life and I don’t imagine I will ever have an experience like that again.  I left for law school at the end of the summer.  Rod wanted to get over me, so he tried to cut off contact.   Then he slipped up and “accidentally” sent me an e-mail that he had been working on, but not really planning on sending.  He claims it was a drunken mistake, I prefer to think it was either a subconscious desire to keep me in his life or a beautifully cruel twist of fate.  Either way we started e-mailing each other.  Which evolved into me drunkenly dialing him up at 3 in the morning (his time).  Which blew up when he got fed up and called me up (drunkenly) at 3 in the morning (my time).  He spent two hours calling me a manipulative cunt, and other such sweet nothings.  I sat there and cried, but I knew what he was doing. Rod is truly honest and does not lie well.  He figured if he pissed me off enough and hurt me enough that I would never want to speak to him again and he would finally be free of me so he could get over me.  Well, it worked, but not in the way that he intended it to.  There’s no other way to put this, so forgive me if I sound cheesy and insane: I was moved by his display of emotion.  It was painfully apparent that my presence (even though I was three thousand miles away and my voice and e-mails were eerily detached from any real physical presence) was hurting him enough that he felt the only way to end the pain was to destroy any love I had for him.  His little act didn’t really destroy anything, in fact it only made me care for him more, such was the increase in affection and respect that I did my best to keep away from him.  And then… at the end one of the shittiest years of my life (my first year at law school) he “accidentally” e-mails me again.  This time it was one of his hi-lar-ious e-mails that he sends every now and then to his “favorite contacts.”  The next day I received the following e-mail:    Subject: 	Sorry          A drunken mistake.I never took the time to remove your name from my  quick list of favorite contacts.It is now removed.Fear not.It won't happen  again.Hope you're doing well.    Removed, eh?  Well.  Shit.  So what did I do?  I took it as a sign from the heavens, or at least a workable excuse, to call him up.  The conversation couldn’t have gone any better.  We laughed, we talked about music, and how shitty law school was, and random websites, I electrocuted myself (my phone started to die and I tried to unplug the mini-fridge so I could plug in the ac-adapter and I zapped myself) and we established tentative e-mail contact.  I didn’t want to push things so I wait until last week to write him.  And then, surprisingly, he sent me a wonderful e-mail.  When I read it I was laughing out-loud, my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my throat because I was so giddy with emotion and then I almost started crying because I realized how much I missed him.  Consequently I have been afraid to write back.  But then today I got another e-mail (again, one of his favorite contact e-mails) and I decided that it would be safe to write.  But it was such a busy week that this is the first opportunity I have had.  And since I had been neglecting my blog, I was faced with the dilemma that opens this entry.  Rod or blog?  I realize now, that I can’t actually send this to him.   All the emotional nostalgia might force him to cut me off again. So this will have to a blog entry only.  Okay. I guess I better go and right to rod.

      Well, I did it.  I was intentional deceptive today.  I went into work perky, smiling, wearing pink and proceeded to keep up the facade of giving a flying fuck for the rest of the day.    All and all it was that bad.  But then again, that's because it wasn't too hard.  You see, today was "SPA day."  That's right, spa day, where three female attorney took all the female summer associates out to a spa,  urlLink Spa Mystique  to be precise.  I received the  urlLink sugar body polish  and a pedicure.  And since I like the female summer associates it was a surpisingly relaxing day.  Now, tomorrow is the real challenge.  The more I think about my work situation, the more optimistic I am.  I actually like most of the summers, the only people I really don't care for are Partners John, Patrick and Joe.    I wanted to call up MR. Vince tonight, and in fact, I was going to call him up, but then I realized I don't have his fucking number.  And that is a definite sign that he is not interested in me.  Sigh... that's too bad.  Time to target some other guy for a summer fling.  Unfortantely Mr. Shaheen is not really my type.

      I have always hated that phrase.  My father used to say it, both when he was chastising me and when he was praising me.  And now I have even more reason to hate that fucking phrase.  My boss of sorts reprimanded me at work on Friday, accusing me of acting "too cool for school."  Well, that is bullshit.  You see, I am so not cool.  I have a fucking blog for christ's sake.  I played dungeons and dragons.  I played live action Vampire the Masquerade in college.  I graduated with a 3.96 and a degree in philosophy.  I am about as cool as Arizona asphalt on an august afternoon.    He also accused me of acting like I know everything.  Which is probably true. But it's hard when you actually do know everything.  Okay, no, I don't really believe that I know everything.  Actually, that's the whole point of this blog. See, I secretly doubt that I know anything at all.  I know I am big old fucking fraud, thus the reference to Stradlater.    Maybe my boss is right, maybe I try too hard in social situations and I come across like an arrogant know-it-all asshole.  But then again, I have also been told that I come across as an insecure dumb bimbo.  I can't seem to get the balance right.  Everyone says, well, instead of trying to come across as something, why don't you just BE YOURSELF.    But that's the whole fucking problem.  There is no "self" for me to be. I am just one big collage of other people's impressions.  The only time I really ever feel like I am being myself is when I am overcome by powerful emotions.  When I play a really rocking song in the car and I'm driving 80 mph and feel like violently turning the steering wheel just because.  Or when I am reading an amazing book and the writing is so good, and the characters are so real and I feel like I want to through myself off a bridge because I will never be able to express that sort of raw emotion in such a beautiful and moving way.  Or when I look over at someone like MR. David, and I am struck by how truly handsome he is and how strong and independent he can be and I realize that I will never be as interesting and admirable as he is.  Then, and only then, do I think I might have found a bottom to all the masks I put on.    But I can't exactly be that "self" in public, now can I?  That would go over just swell at the Firm.  Playing music in my office, full blast, Screaming at the top of my lungs because I am sitting in a big white box surrounded by the dull and the dying.    Now, I know I am being unfair.  I don't expect everyone to be a great artist or to feel uncontainable passion for life or to unrestrainably love and hate the human condition.  People, after all, must live. We must muddle through the mundanity of our lives.  And being a lawyer is no better or worse than any other distraction.  Not to mention, that some of those people really love what they do. They get off on winning trials the same way rock musicians get off on putting on a good show.    I know the real problem is me. My boss, though he happened to put it in simultaneously the most ridiculous and the most infuriating way possible (too cool for school) did touch on a reality.  I HATE MY FUCKING JOB and IT IS ALL MY OWN FAULT. I  do  have an attitude problem.  And it's because I don't have the discipline to suppress all that angst, ennui, etc.    Basically, I have been acting like a teenager.  I either need to 1) learn to love my work, 2) swallow my pride and suck-up and be fake and muddle through my job, or 3) quit.  Because I don't want to be that annoying little fuck of an employee who hates their work, but won't quit and makes everybody else miserable.

      It's the little things that count, right?  The compliment you give to the stranger in the elevator.  The smile you flash your co-worker in the hall.  The affirming comment you make to your employee.  It's also the little things that will kill you, or at least drive you crazy.  The friend who doesn't call you back The date that was broken with no reason The milk left on the counter for a week by your roomate The added hour of lonliness because you left work early The extra mile you drove for nought because the post-office was closed by the time you got there The little hole in your heart that grows a little bit bigger every time that stupid fucking piece of shit lying unfaithful self-centered asshole DOESN'T FUCKING CALL when he has PROMISED he would  WELL FUCK YOU!  Fuck you, MR. David.  Fuck all your bullshit about being a good friend and caring about me and being so FUCKING HONEST. Your not honest.  You can't even keep a promise.  What kind of fucking honesty is that.    The worst part is, none of the ranting, none of the crying, none of the pounding my fists on the bed does me any good.  I just need to let it go, but I can't.  I want him out of my life, and I dont do a damn thing about it. It makes me sick.  I am too tired, too pissed off to even bother spell checking.  goodnight

      My whole life I have been waiting.  Not for any one big thing, I have spent my time waiting, rather, for many small insignificant things.  The first day of my junior year of high school.  The Junior State of America (JSA) conference in Spokane, WA in late fall.  Going to see a movie with one of my few friends. I waited for high school graduation (which thankfully came a year early for me as I did everything I could to get out of that god-awful place).  Then I wait until my trip to europe.  then I waited until college graduation, when I would finally be able to break up with Mr. Kaleb without guilt.  (though the guilt came any way and still rears its head from time to time).  Then I waited for the summer to be over, for my LSAT scores to come.  For my applications to be finished.  For law schools to send me their decisions. Then for law school to start.  And then for the end of my first year, which I thought would never come.  And now that is has, now I can't wait for summer to end.    So it is Monday, and I am waiting for the weekend to roll around.  This saturday the Firm is taking the summer associates to Disneyland, which despite my jaded outlook, my cynicism and sarcasm; I am actually looking forward to.  I love rollercoasters.  Anyway, back to my habit of wait.  This weekend disneyland, but when there is nothing to do on the weekends, I wait impatiently for monday to arrive, grateful for the return to work as a chance to occupy the empty space in my moral life.  I am afraid of being alone so I need specific tasks, definite goals, hard plans, in order to mask the vast stretches of time I spend on my own.  Not that I am ever really on my own.  I am constantly surrounded by masses of people.  The over-crowded freeways in the morning.  The hum of the office chatter during the day.  The polite conversation I barely manage while waiting for the elevator.  The long lunches spent desperately trying to cover up how little I care about these people.  And why should I care since they can barely bring themselves to mask how little they care about me?  Then back amidst the stop-and-go traffic, the convertible top down so as to better take in the swarm of humanity I am drowning in.  For an hour or two I may be in my apartment alone, but the sounds of from the street barge in through my window.  Later my roommate will arrive.  I won't usually speak to him, not because I dislike him, just because we do not have much to say to one another.  But his presence is still felt.  He talks to his friends and family on the phone.  Maybe his girlfriend.  I have never bothered to ask if has one.  And if all of this human contact hasn't cured my of my loneliness I have my books to keep me company.  Yet despite all of this. I am afraid. And alone.  And if I had some poetic or musical talent I might use this to my advantage:  I sit in one of the dives On Fifty-second Street Uncertain and afraid As the clever hopes expire Of a low dishonest decade:  Waves of anger and fear  Circulate over the bright And darkened lands of the earth,  Obsessing our private lives; The unmentionable odour of death  Offends the September night.   That's Auden.  The first stanza from  urlLink September 1, 1939 .  A truly great poem.    Some people like to put fluffy kittens and inspirational quotes from important persons, or daytime television hosts in their offices.  I posted September 1, 1939.  I really should place it on the door, but that might be a little too offensive to the other office workers. So instead, it’s on my wall above my desk.  For those of you bothering to read this, but not bothering to click on the link and read the whole poem, the particularly offensive stanzas are:  Into this neutral air Where blind skyscrapers use  Their full height to proclaim  The strength of Collective Man,  Each language pours its vain  Competitive excuse: But who can live for long In an euphoric dream; Out of the mirror they stare,  Imperialism's face And the international wrong.  . . . . .   From the conservative dark Into the ethical life The dense commuters come, Repeating their morning vow; 'I will be true to the wife, I'll concentrate more on my work,' And helpless governors wake To resume their compulsory game:  Who can release them now, Who can reach the dead, Who can speak for the dumb?  And I do mean offensive because Auden was criticizing the emptiness of modern life. He wanted to the reader to be shocked and offended because we only take offense we were being implicated. And let’s face of it, most of us do lead empty lives and will find no solace in our meaningless work, work devoid of value because it touches no one, helps no one, creates no community, furthers no human connection.  Except for the literary allusions, which I happen to believe are detractions, it is a wonderful poem.  And allusions or not it is worlds better than anything i could ever write.  Well. with that, I am back to my fake world of friends: my current book, a mystery novel written by one of my professors.  Sadly, the book is really quite good. I say sadly because I don't really want to like the man after the rudeness he showed me last semester.  But, no, the book is really quite good, and again much better than anything I will ever write.  Sigh...  At least it has stopped getting so chilly at night.  Too bad Mr. David did not call as promised.  Fuck them all.

      Sorry for missing two days of posting.  I had a tiresome and messy weekend.  Mr. David finally made it down to LA to visit.  The little shit wouldn't even commit to spending the night here, though he was eventually convinced.  I hate the person I am around him.  Manipulative, bitchy, jealous, bitter, short-tempered, weak and pathetic.     Manipulative:    I asked him if he had informed his ex-girlfriend about my existence.  He said he had told her he was "sleeping with someone."  Sleeping with someone? Am I just someone he fucks? Well, yes.  He does care for me as a person, as a friend, but in the end, I am really just someone he fucks. Well fuck that.  I told him to leave and I told him I didn't want to see him again for a very long time.  Then as he tried to walk out the door, I blocked his path, slammed the door shut and burst into tears.  I don't ever intend to be melodramatic, but it happens over and over again.     Bitchy:    I grilled him on the visitation arrangements.  Shiana, shena, shiena, whatever the little cunt's name is, is visiting Mr. David at the end of July.  Had they talked about getting back together, I asked.  He was non-communicative at best.  I know they tell each other that they miss each other. I know he still loves her and she still probably loves him. I take back the part about her being a cunt, I would do nothing less than what she has done.  Actually, she has handled herself remarkably well and has acted far classier than I.  She's visiting, as friend, and that's all, so he claims.  Then again, I am a friend and that is all.  I know they will end up back together, yet I let the hope that they won't torture me.     Jealous:   When I was looking for the parking garage ticket, I went through his wallet.  He still has a photo of his ex-girlfriend, who is, honestly, not much of a looker.  Not ugly, just not a hottie.  I couldn't help but feel slighted nonetheless. I know I am better in bed than she is, I know David is more attracted to me than to her.  He told me so in one of his weaker moments of actual honesty. (He prides himself on his honesty, but he is very confused as to what that word means.  Honesty is not the absence of lies.  Honesty also requires openness and forthrightness, which he altogether lacks).  Still, he loves her and he doesn't love me and that drives me insane.  I realize that if a stranger were to read this blog, Mr. David would not come across as the really great guy that he is.  This unjustified animosity toward him and resentment I harbor against him is another attribute on the list of things I hate about myself.   Bitter:  Mr. David is extremely affectionate in the morning.  He holds me close and won't let me leave when I try to get up to take a shower.  Just a little bit longer, he says.  He kisses the top of my head, which is pressed against his chest.  He smells good, he always smells good.  I should be happy, but I am not.  Because all of this affection, all of this domesticity is just a FUCKING ILLUSION.  I am not his girlfriend, I am just someone he is FUCKING.  And all that FUCKING bitterness gets in the way of me enjoying our truly pleasurable moments, such as lying in bed together.   Short-tempered:  In addition to the door slamming incident, I also snapped at him for various things, including his refusal to say whether or not he was going to spend the night, his inability to return my phone calls, and his unwillingness to make definite plans to see me again before he flies back east.   Weak and pathetic:  Did I mention Mr. David is also a classmate?  We attend the same prestigious law school back east.  We hate the same toolish students that populate our school.  We are both social misfits, both fiercely intelligent, and both unable to apply that intelligence in socially acceptable manner that is needed to climb the academic ladder.  I don't give a shit about gerunds, I don't care about comma splices (obviously) and sure as fuck don't give a shit about  urlLink the bluebook  (the book detailing the inane rules for documenting law review articles).  I like Mr. David because he is unique and aloof and independent from the crowd. I like Mr. David because he is passionate about ideas, but not in that fake academic way. I like Mr. David because he can play a mean riff.  I like Mr. David because he is really fucking amazing in bed.  I like him, i like him, sometimes, I think I even love him. And yet. And yet, I know he is very very bad for me.  I need some one who loves me.  Some one to be my advocate.  Yes, that is weak and pathetic.  I should be able to get by with friends and family.  But I can't.  I need a boyfriend. I need someone who can re-assure all my insecurities.  Well.  Not just any boyfriend.  I need someone who I can love. And that means someone I can admire, someone: smart, funny, independent, socially outside the box, artistically involved, honest, kind, compassionate and loving.  And Mr. David is those things, except that Mr. David doesn't love me. And that should be enough to send a girl of my intelligence RUNNING away and  FIGHTING him off is he tries to pursue.  But what do  I ?  I FUCK him.  Why?  Because I am weak and pathetic. And in the end, not all that intelligent.  So we departed ways Saturday afternoon.  He went off to mix his demo.  I went off to see Mario, friend of MR. Vince and hopefully a friend of mine as well.  Mario and I had a good time.  We went to  urlLink club spaceland . The same place I saw  urlLink the standard .  Incidentally, there name needs to be changed.  There is no way that they will ever hit the top of the google list, unless their fans bother to google-fix/google-bomb them.  Anyway, so Mario is very cool.  Unfortunately, I think I may have pissed him off somehow.  Though I wasn't getting a vibe from him before, now I wonder if maybe he was interested in me and I upset him by telling him that I had a crush on Mr. Vince.  I won't bother with the details, but to make a long story short. Well not too short.  Last time Mario and Mr. Vince and I hung out Mario mentioned to Mr. V, that he thought I liked him (referring to Mr. V). MR. V, in turn, said, "no, I think she likes you" (referring to Mario).  Mario, told me this, ostensive in order to illustrate what a nice guy Mr. V is.  You see Mario has not had very good luck with women recently (actually something very very sad happened between him and his last serious girlfriend, and was definitely not Mario’s fault), so Mr. V, as Mario was explaining, was trying to be a good friend to Mario.  But I wonder.  Was Mr. V really being nice and giving Mario the okay sign to pursue me? Or was Mr. V trying to pass me off onto his friend because he is not interested?  We shall see.  Anyway, I really like Mario.  As I said, he is very cool. So I hope I didn't accidentally upset him.  And I hope that doesn't seem to egotistical to think he might have been interested in me.   Blah blah.  My love life is a mess.  I know was in love with Mr. Rod, but we can never ever be together (the subject of a future post, I am sure).  I think I could have fallen in love with Mr. Pete, if it hadn't been for the fact that I was in love with Mr. Rod, so Mr. Pete dumped me right after I made a real commitment to make the relationship work.  So I tried to get over Mr. Pete (or rather over the humiliation of being rejected and the frustration of a lost opportunity). I might be in love with Mr. David, but he is not in love with me.  And I have HUGE crush on Mr. Vince, whose friend Mario, might have taken a small interest in me.  I have no one to blame but myself. But fault or not fault, my love life is still a fucking train wreck.  But at least I am getting tan.  Oh incidentally, since my love life is such a mess, I shall reserve the MR. title for boyfriends, ex-boyfriends, lovers, would-be lovers, etc.  Friends, enemies, non-entities, shall remain untitled.  Brief recap of today and then time for ambien and bed.  1) slept in until noon. 2) daydreamt about Mr. Vince 3) finally got around and made it to the beach 4) read for three hours.   5) went home and cooked dinner 6) played Mr. Vince's guitar 7) Read some more 8) wrote this blog entry.  Well that's all for now folks.  Ha! Folks! well, I guess you are never too old for imaginary friends.

      I don't understand  urlLink Pixies  lyrics, but i don't really care either. because the Pixies ROCK!  I've had  urlLink Dig for Fire  stuck in my head all day, which is not a bad thing.    Anyway.  Today's headlines.  MR. Vince brought me a guitar today.  Yep.  A nice one too.  He's loaning me it for the summer.  His new fuckability rating: 25.  Speaking of FR's.  My personal FR seems to depend on the age of the male.  For your above-average looking 23-28 year-old, about a 4.  For your below-average looking 40 year-old: 250.  I *must* stop going to concerts alone.  I am a very easy target.  Went to see  urlLink Mission of Burma  tonight at the  urlLink MusicBox .  They also ROCK. especially for 40 year-olds.  Anyway. I met a very nice 40 year-old at the show.  Unfortunately, I am not interested. Despite my comment about the lolita thing, it really is a FANTASY, which means I don't really want to pursue it.  Except maybe with MR. Vince.  But maybe that is because he is not into me and therefor does not come across as sleazy or unethical.  Not that I think there is anything really wrong with cross-generational sexual relationships.  I just don't trust most older guys who are interested in 20-somes.    It's like  urlLink groucho  said, "I wouldn't sleep with any 40 year-old who'd want to sleep with me." Okay, well what he really said was "I wouldn't join any club which would have me as a member," but close enough.   Well. Yesterday I promised I would discuss Mr.s David and Rod.  I am too tired to talk about Mr. Rod.  He deserves more attention than I can give right now.  But here is Mr. David, in brief.  Gender: male, but not overly masculine (except in bed, see below) Race: whiter than white Age: 26 Height: not very tall Weight: holocaust victim Religion: culturally jewish (I guess that makes the last comment even more un-p.c.) Talents/Attributes: Amazing in bed, Pretty fucking good at guitar, truly smart, Tres funny, basically nice.  Things I like about him: his sarcasm & wit.  Would not intentionally hurt someone. Good taste in music.  Doesn't really care about what other people think about him. independent. Creative.  Did I mention he is really good in bed?  Things that drive me nuts: He never calls.  Ever.  He shows very little visible interest in me.  self centered at times.    But the only big thing I don't like is that he doesn't like me. At least not in the right way.  Shit, I don't reallly have the energy to explain MR. David either.    If I sound insecure it's because I am.  But that doesn't mean that I don't have a realistic assesment of myself.  So I will end with these observations.  --I am terrified of rejection --As a consequence, I hit on men who I think I have a chance with --As a consequence, I think I am now conditioned to find real hotties (the GQ models,  etc.) unattractive. --I am not, however, ugly, so there are plenty of guys who do the exact same thing that I do.  I.E., they hit on me because they think I won't say no. --If I had female friends, I would be the chick who the wingman gets stuck with.  My friend would be the hottie every one else is after. --Despite all of this.  I only date guys I am really into. I throw myself into my relationships.  I am one-hundred percent into whoever I date.  Otherwise i dont date them.   --I just want a guy who is 100% into me, not someone who is dating me because they think I am just pathetic enough not to say no, and just cool enough that they can stand me.  okay. folks, that's all for tonight.  Tomorrow I am supposed to see MR. D.  I bet five bucks he breaks the date...

      Wednesday, the dreaded hump day. or was it tuesday today?  I actually had to stop and think about it.  Well, it must have been wednesday (I use the past tense, it being 12:30 am), because it was, in all ways, a shitty day.  Let's start at the begining   Act I, Scene I:   Time:  12:30 AM  Place:   urlLink Club Spaceland , Los Angeles, CA.  State of Mind:  Mostly Sober  I had just finished sitting through two and a half shitty bands. Not true: one really shitty band, one band that was entirely unnovel, but okay to listen to, and one band,  urlLink the standard , which I thought would fucking ROCK, but which were really just OKAY live.   Plugging those values into the rockability calculus, the evening's rating was: -2.5.    To top it off,  everybody  at the concert was dressed like an emo catalog model.  (see instructions on  urlLink how-to dress emo ), except for one dude: MR. I-Look-like-jesus-and-smell-like-him-too-because-i-haven't-bathed-shaved-or-changed-my-shirt-in-a-month DUDE.  And, of course, he was the ONLY guy who hit on me.    Well, i guess it wasn't like I was going to the show to get picked-up.  Oh, who am I kidding? Of course that is part of the reason I went.  That and the need to earn coolness points with Vince/David/Rod and other misc. men in my life.  But more on that later...   Act I, Scene 2   Time:  1:35  Location:  Some where, I don't know where, in the middle of Los Angeles.  State of Mind:  95% sober, 100% paranoid, and really needing to pee.  I got totally fucking lost trying to find my way home. I made it there eventually. But I kept looking for the damn cops.  Not that I was in danger of getting a DUI.  Well, I don't know, maybe I was.  What's the limit these days? .08, that's about one drink. I had two starting at 9pm, but no dinner.  So maybe I was at risk...  Yeah, yeah we all know that drunk driving is not something one should do, or joke about.  Well, maybe it's okay to joke about: So a priest is driving drunk down the road...   Act II, Scene 1   Time:  seven-o'clock-in-the-fucking-A.M.  Location:  in my small and sadly empty bed  State of Mind:  Hung over.  Nuff said.   Act III, Scene 1   Time:  11:30  AM  Location:  The Firm  State of Mind:  Hungry, tired, frustrated and feeling generally stupid  Not only do I constantly feel stupid at my job (I am a grossly over-paid summer associate, read: law student, at an LA firm, to remain unamed for now), but I have only two people to smoke with.    Also, I fucking hate my HR director.  She is a total fake-nice cunt and I can't stand her. And despite all my rants about not liking play-nice-social-interactions and false pretences, the uncertainity of whether or not she overheard me telling another co-worker that I didn't like her is driving me batty.   And where were my two smokers, but nowhere...   Act III, Scene 2   Time:  sometime later  Location:  Smoking a cig. outside The Firm.  Enter MR. Vince.  Smoker #1.  Vince is great. He's smart, cute, nice, interesting and has good taste in music. At least as far as I can tell, since I have only interacted with him a couple of times.  Did I mention that he's hot?  Even, with the piece of rice, which of course I noticed, on the front of his shirt.  (Hey, Vince, if you're reading this, I have even more reason to be embarrassed than you do.)  Did I mention that he's 40? and I'm 23.  Probably not.  Aye, and there's the rub.  I am quite certain that Mr. Vince has nothing but the nicest intentions towards me and I must appear to be quite a baby to him.  And that's really too bad.  Let's do the math:    *  Former rock musician = +5  (those damn guitarists) *  Former alcoholic  = +3 (can't help but like the bad boys) *  Former alcoholic  = -3 (would feel guilty about driving him to drink) *  Offered to loan me an     "extra" electric  = +4 *  Is an "older man" = +4 (i have a lolita fantasy). *  Kept his youthful     good looks        = +5 *  Has a shitty hair-cut  = -3  *  Likes his shitty hair-cut = +4 (i like his "I don't give a damn about what other's think attitude")  I think that comes out to 19 on the fuckability scale.  Which is pretty damn high (Mr. Jesus-Dude was a negative 40).    Anyway.  MR. Vince is cool. But completely unavailable.  I am still trying to get his number without coming across as hitting on him.  Because honestly, I actually like him independently of any carnal desire and I don't want to scare him off (since he could be a very cool friend).  Anyway, this is part of the shitty day, because even though I am trying to play it cool, I am sure I come across as pathetic, lonely and overly eager.  Sigh... I used to make fun of people for wearing eau de desperation, now I am its fucking spokeswoman    Act III, Scene 3.   Time:  7:00 pm  Location:   I-10 West  State of Mind:  Bored, exhausted, sucking fumes in LA traffic.  Nothing to do after work, no one to come home to.  At least my amazon package was there when I got home.   Act IV, Scene 1   Time:  8 pm to present  Location:  in front of my laptop  State of Mind:  self-loathing amusement  As I said, I had nothing better to do.  So I started this blog.  How Paaaa_thet_IC! oh yeah and I smell bad.  and I have a dry cough because the office air is to dry and I smoke a pack of cigs yesterday.  And I am tired. and cranky. and I keep thinking about the stupid things I said: i) at the concert to the band when I purchased their CD, ii) to my office-mate about my HR director, iii) MR. Vince, iv) David.    Who is David? Or Rod, for that matter.  That will have to wait for the next post because I'm tired and I'm going to bed.  Where's my damn Ambien?   Fin

      "You remember I said before that Ackley was a slob in his personal habits? Well, so was Stradlater, but in a different way. Stradlater was more of a secret slob. He always looked all right, Stradlater, but for instance, you should’ve seen the razor he shaved himself with. It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap. He never cleaned it or anything. He always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up, but he was a secret slob anyway, if you knew him the way I did."              ---Excerpt from J.D. Salinger's  Cather In the Rye .  Confession: I am a secret slob in just about every aspect of my life, except I'm not very good at keeping it secret.  Still ... I am living in the right town for it. Los Angeles: home of deceptions, falsities and all thing fraudulent.    Okay. So now that I've dispensed with the preliminary "why" of my blog title, which I first tried to name  urlLink slander ,  urlLink slanderland ,  urlLink backbitter , or  urlLink bitterness , I can move on to the important stuff, such as disclaimers:  1) This blog, like the vast majority of its kindred, will be essentially personal and thus almost invariably boring.  Of course, I wish it weren't so.  I wish my life were interesting enough to have an audience (and perhaps a standard rock trio to follow me around and play theme music).  2) This blog is full of shit.  Not actually factually untrue shit.  Just slightly exaggerated shit, magnified or contracted images of myself and my enemies. Ha! there's one now! I don't even really have enemies.  Just people I don't care for. I can't even say that I truly hate them, though I throw the word around quite a bit.    3) Though I know no one is really going to bother reading this, I secretly wish that there were devoted fans.  I suppose I could send my blog address to my mother, who would then pass it on to my aunts and dying grandmother, all of who would actually read this shit.  But then, of course, I couldn't write posts like today's (which I will be getting to shortly).  My cousin actually did this, gave out his blog address to the fam.  His mother put him in therapy because of an off-hand comment he made on-line.  Ha-ha.  Well I'm too old for that, my therapy is complete voluntary.  Nope, I'm in danger of being cut-off. Or at least nagged to death about my smoking, drinking, fucking, slacking, and other behavior, which, on the whole, is entirely unscandalous (at least by today's standard, though not by my parent's).    4) I have no good/worthwhile/informative/helpful/interesting opinions on i) the state of world politics, ii) the state of technology, iii) outrages to the online community, iv) anti-spamming measures or iv) anything of general or special interest.  In the words of Dostoevsky (who captured the spirit of blogging in  urlLink Notes From the Underground ):  "But what can a decent man speak of with most pleasure? Answer: Of himself. Well, so I will talk about myself."

      No I haven't died. Yes I am a bad bad blogger  Last Week = All Mr. NYU, all the time Last Weekend = All poker, all the time This Week = Friends from Seattle in town = all site-seeing all the time  Quick updates:  affirmatively ditched mr. shahin mr. saturday night called, did not return phone call need to ditch jack too, but I think he has already gotten the idea and has pulled away.&nbsp; I feel bad about this one because Jack is actually a good guy and fun and sweet (unfortuntately, completely incompatible).  What else.&nbsp; David called friday, haven't called him back. the longest he made me wait to return a phone call was two weeks.&nbsp; petty to do the same to him.&nbsp; but honestly, his ex-gf is coming in two days.&nbsp; at this point with mr. nyu around I might as well try to just forget about david.  okay.&nbsp; off to work  &nbsp;

      Small thrills.&nbsp; I have claimed the number one spot on google for the search term "secret slob."  Problem 4: What the hell am I going to do if my parents come across this?&nbsp; I may need to re-think the prolife foto and re-name a few persons.&nbsp; I suppose this is an issue all bloggers must face.  Haha.&nbsp; I sound like one of those cheesy bands that get a single song on the radio and then they think they've made it big and they give these really ridiciously pretentious answers in interviews , "well, now that every station across America [ed. note: all owned by clear channel, of course]is playing our single   we are thinking about doing a world wide tour."&nbsp;   Speaking of&nbsp;lack&nbsp;of fame and fortune.&nbsp;&nbsp;How the hell&nbsp;do I make a links page. I&nbsp;am so&nbsp;inept.&nbsp; I'd like a scroll bar of permanent links on front page.&nbsp; Time to look for some blogger instructions.&nbsp;

      Probably shouldn't writing this at work. but oh well... every other aspect of my life is going to hell, why not my job too.   Problems of the week:   1) Jack is begining to grate on my nerves.&nbsp; Call me fickle, call me a bitch, just don't call me three times a day.&nbsp; He's too interested in me. He's a nice guy but can be really annoying. He swears more than I do.&nbsp; And the way he says "fuck" sounds like an out-of-tune snare drum and that is miked to closely.&nbsp; He has an anger management problem, not in the typical sense (i.e., can't control his outbursts) but in the same way that a band has&nbsp;a management problem when the manager overpromotes and books shows at absurdly out-0f-character venues.&nbsp; Jack thinks anger is&nbsp;cool, self destructive behavior too; he cultivates his bad boy look.&nbsp; Cant stand that.&nbsp; And, of course, he is the exact opposite of david.&nbsp; who is outwardly calm even when he is under extreme stress or in deep depression or feeling raging anger.&nbsp; It's funny that I should complain about Jack's facade as I am, afterall, the secret slob.&nbsp; But the problem with hypocricy is not that the hypocrite believes one thing to be right but acts in a contradictory manner; the problem is that the hypocrite doesn't do the right thing.&nbsp; Period.&nbsp; I may be&nbsp;a hypocrite for calling Jack out on his facade,&nbsp;but the real criticism is that I am a fraud myself.   2) I have started an affair with another co-worker.&nbsp; Please! someone stop me before I date again.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Jack and I are on the down-low and so are Mr. NYU and I.&nbsp; Mr. NYU&nbsp; knows about Jack, but not vice versa, but since Mr. NYU has a ms. girlfriend, i don't i am in danger of him devulging my secret.&nbsp;   3) Theft.&nbsp; I am not cheating on David.&nbsp; I am betraying nothing except my own sense of loyalty to him.&nbsp; I am however stealing from an innocent party: Mr. NYU's Miss. Girlfriend.&nbsp;   &nbsp;

      I sent the following to david:  I&nbsp;had the weirdest dream about you last night. &nbsp;Let me back up. I was so hammered thursday night that I couldn't drive home. &nbsp;A friend came and picked me up. And was still a little drunk at 6am when the friend was supposed to pick me back up for work. &nbsp;I'm my haze I said, don't bother to pick me up, Jen lives on the westside, she can get me to work. &nbsp;Unfortunately, that haze wore off two hours later when I realized that Jen was on a plane to seattle, as were most of the other summer associates. So I took a cab to work on friday morning (didn't realize how expensive that would be!). And then I left I for Las Vegas at 4pm that afternoon. So &nbsp;I am hung-over, in Vegas, spending money I don't have and having a generally good time nonetheless. &nbsp;I made it to bed around 4 am. &nbsp;And I had the weirdest dreams. &nbsp;And you were in on them. I had a dream that I was at a party. &nbsp;And I was pouring this delicious dark beer (I don't even like beer in waking hours). &nbsp;And there were all these beautiful people all over, and I was dressed up and laughing and having a good time. &nbsp;And there was a guy I was flirting with and he was laughing and having a good time. &nbsp;And then I looked over in the corner and saw you sitting there. &nbsp;You had on jeans and white t-shirt with your dark green button up shirt over it and your brown suede jacket. &nbsp;And I thought, what the hell is he doing here? &nbsp;But not in a bad way, just in an extremely surprised sort of way. &nbsp;And I was trying to get across the room to say hi and I kept getting involved in all of the trite conversations and by the time I made it to where you had been you were already gone. &nbsp;And then it struck me. &nbsp;I wasn't having a good time at all. I was miserable and lonely. And then I woke up. And I was in a strange bed in a strange town and you weren't there and I felt very very very alone. Anyway. &nbsp;I am going to see the Magnetic Fields tonight, and then Modest Mouse on Monday night and the old 97s on wednesday. &nbsp;I have been spending so much time going out that I hardly have a moment alone. &nbsp;And yet, I also feel extremely isolated. &nbsp;I guess I am coming to understand that many of my daily interactions are ultimately empty ones. &nbsp;And I find myself wishing I were home. &nbsp;Except I don't really have a home anymore, so I guess I wish that I could feel at home. &nbsp; There's a lot more I want to tell you, but I suppose this is getting a little bit overly sentimental. &nbsp;I do want to say that I miss being around you. &nbsp;I know I acted crazy sometimes, but for the most part you had a really calming effect on me. &nbsp;And being with you was the closest thing I felt to being at home. &nbsp; If I haven't been calling all that often it's because I am trying to give you time and space to figure things out. &nbsp;I admit that I used to get really angry when you wouldn't call. &nbsp;I had a difficult time understanding your position. &nbsp;I think maybe I am begining to have geniune empathy for what you are going through. &nbsp;I've gone of several dates this last month, and things that could have been dates if I hadn't stopped them from making a move. &nbsp;And even though I am sure they are all nice people, I just can't quite bring myself to fully interact with them because... well because I miss you and want to be with you and they just aren't you. &nbsp; And I've also been talking with Rod fairly often. &nbsp;And now I am begining to see what you mean about needing time and space. &nbsp;Because looking back at how things turned out with pete, a huge part of it was my inability to let go out how I felt about rod. &nbsp; Finally, I am really annoying when I am drunk. &nbsp;Especially when you are sober. &nbsp;Since you have to drive every where in LA we take turns being designated driver. &nbsp;Wow, drunk people are really annoying. &nbsp; sorry about all of those drunken phone calls and puke/babysitting sessions. &nbsp; Okay. &nbsp;So those are my life lessons for the week. &nbsp;I don't really know why I am writing you all of this. &nbsp;Maybe it is just because that dream was so vivid and that really horrible feeling of not being able to talk to you has stuck with me all day. &nbsp; It would be nice if you would write or call. &nbsp;But I understand if fiss is keeping you busy or if the weight of hot humid new haven air has drained your strength away and you can't bring yourself to respond. yours truly,   katherine -------------  Wish I hadn't sent it. I hate all the crap you have to pretend you don't feel. i hate this game of giving space. and acting cool. and happy. well. i'm not happy.&nbsp;

      Well, I should be working but I am writing this instead.&nbsp; Just a quick preview of the posts to come. &nbsp; Thursday Night -- Too much to drink at  urlLink The Standard&nbsp; &nbsp;sets the stage for a comical taxi ride friday morning. &nbsp; Friday Monday-- taxi driver reluctant to drop me off in the middle of arlington heights says, "This is not a neighboor for blond girls." &nbsp; Friday Evening-- Las Vegas!&nbsp; What happens in vegas is supposed to stay there, but fuck it! I've been breaking all the other rules, so why not this one too. &nbsp; Saturday Evening -- Magnetic Fields unplugged, fans stupid as ever. &nbsp; Saturday Evening, continued -- Lies and more Lies.&nbsp; Ditched my date early on to make another one.&nbsp; Unfortunately they both work at my office.&nbsp; I'm really pushing the envelope here. &nbsp; Sunday Morning -- Suntan lotion and sand.&nbsp; I love venice beach. Must relocate as soon as possible.&nbsp; &nbsp; Monday Morning -- Surprisingly chipper considering the overwhelming amount of alcohol I consumed this weekend and the insufficient amount of sleep.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Tonight: Modest Mouse concert.&nbsp; will post more tomorrow.&nbsp; Back to work. &nbsp; P.S. I haven't a clue who Tony is, or why he is using the name "sev."&nbsp; Tony, you out there?&nbsp; Can you explain?&nbsp;

      Sev does not seem to allow comments on his page.  So I will respond to  urlLink happy-pills  here:  From the conservative dark Into the ethical life The dense commuters come, Repeating their morning vow; 'I will be true to the wife, I'll concentrate more on my work,' And helpless governors wake To resume their compulsory game:  Who can release them now, Who can reach the dead, Who can speak for the dumb?   You should read the whole poem if you haven't already.  It's W. H. Auden and the title is "september 1, 1939.  I posted it once before, but it's my new favorite poem.

      Since nothing of note happened today I shall attempt to re-create that lost entry.  So it was tuesday afternoon and the second day mock-trial week at The Firm.  I am still nervous as hell.  Wanting to die every time I have to give a practice cross-examination, or be a mock-witness.    Added to that stress is my memo.  My precious 13 page memo that was reduced to a 8 page overview.  Yes, yes, only five pages cut.  But try doing that to something you've worked weeks on.   Maybe it was because I was tired (I did stay out until 3 the night before).  Maybe it was because I had low-blood sugar (only ate two slices of pizza all day).  Maybe I am just depressed (like  urlLink sev  aks, where do buy serotonin?).  Or maybe I am just an overdramatic cry-baby.  But for whatever reason I was crying in my office.    So I packed up my things, went out to my car, put the top down and started driving.  But not very fast or very far.  Traffic was unusually heavy.  As I sat at the stoplight before the freeway the homeless man who is always there came up to my car.  I didn't give him anything.  And then the guilt set in.  You see, I don't like homeless people.  That may sound cruel or horrible, but I suspect it's a common sentiment.  You see the problem with homeless people (now hear me out before you get offended) the problem with homeless people, and I am talking about the chroniclly homeless ones, the problem with homeless people (aside from the fact that they are usually unattractive, unhygenic, often drunk and/or high, mentally off-kilter and smelly) is that they ask us for money.  And unless you are really cold, really unsympathetic or really stupid, that should make you feel guilty.    So there I was, sitting in my cherry red convertible (it's not an expensive car, but it runs and it looks good), having just come from my posh job (that pays 2400 a week), with my posh education (one of the finest law schools in the nation) and I am crying because my mock-trial makes me nervous, and my memo wasn't perfect, and Mr. david hadn't called in two weeks.  And this homeless man, who is there every day of the week, asks me for money and I turn him down. And then I feel guilty.  Because I have everything and he has nothing.  And it's just dumb luck that it turned out that way.  I have everything and he has nothing and he could have just as well have been I, and I he.  And then I started feeling angry.  Angry that I felt guilty.  Because after all, I still have problems too.  It's not like money solves every thing.  It's not like just because you aren't in a really shitty situation that you have no right to feel bad at anything.   And then I started feeling guilty for being angry at the homeless man who made me feel guilty.  See, this is why I don't like homeless people.  Damn it. they make me reflect on the good things when I just want to sulk.  Luckily the light turned green and I drove away.  But not very far and not very fast.  Traffic jammed up again.  This time it was a three car accident. Two girls were standing on the side of the road crying.  And then I felt even worse about feeling bad.  Because, hey, that could have been me too.  And at least my car is working.    Traffic eventually cleared, it gave me time though to work myself back into my melencholy state.  And I drove on.  But not very far and not very fast.  Traffic slowed down to ten miles and hour.  People were doing weird things up ahead, weaving around some object on the road.  It was a very large rodent (perhaps a rodent of unusually large size?)  Seriously, as big as a big fat cat.  It's tail had been managled and it stood rigidly frozen right smack in the middle of a four lane freeway, it's teeth bared at every passing car.  For now, people were managing to avoid hitting it.  But I knew that soon enough some cruel asshole would (trying to show off to his friends, or just to busy to be bothered) would run the creature over.  And I actually felt a great deal of sympathy for the animal's plight.  Probably more so than I had felt for the homeless man's.  And once again I felt guilty about feeling so down.  then to top it all off:  My brother called to tell me he loved me Shahin called (I ignored him) Jack called (returning my phone call) And David called (he said he missed me)  So I have people who love me, care about me, like me.  So you see my life is perfect.  So fucking perfect.  So could some please explain to me why I feel like shit all the time?  ------------------

      Well. Shit.  I wrote a nice long and surprisingly deep post. But thanks to Blogger's maintenance it's gone. Guess I can't complain much.  This happens a lot in my e-mail program and I know I should copy and paste before I hit a button like "send" or "publish post."  Now I am torn.  Should I attempt to re-create it? Or should I move on?  Since it is now 11pm and I have to get up very early. I am tempted to move on.  But if I don't write it now it will become obsolete and therefore unpostable.  Sigh.  So this week is Trial Advocacy Week here at The Firm.  We get to pretend  like we are real lawyers trying a real case before a real judge and  real jury.  It's terrifying because even though it is all make-believe  it's actually pretty darn close to what trial lawyers actually do.  The firm even hired people from a temp agency to listen to our mock  trial.  They have been told that we are real lawyers doing a mock run-  through of a real trial.  I had to give my opening speech in a practice  session and I about passed out.  It turns out I have stage fright so  guess I'll never be a rock star.     Did I mention that The Firm rented the rose bowl and threw a big party  there on last saturday (the night of the fuck to forget hook-up, which actually didn't involve any fuck)?  Well, if I didn't mention it, I am now.  The Firm rented out the rose fucking bowl.  You know where they play football?  Like the big, expensive stadium in pasedena?  They rented out the whole thing, brought in a few carnival rides (mostly the lame ones that only require you to fill them with air, but still!)  They had  tons of food, copious amounts of alcohol and a live (cover) band.  The  band, was too be expected, not great, but they played mostly classic  rock, which was fun.  At one point I yelled out "Play some AC/DC!" I  didn't think they heard me, but a few songs later they plaid "you shook  me all night long."  So that was kind of cool. kind of, because they  butchered the lyrics.  kind of, because I couldn't help but dance.    kind of, because when I was dancing there were only four other people  on the floor (two other summers and two lawyers).  kind of, because it  was really creepy to see the lawyers dance to ac/dc, especially to a  song with lyrics such as   she was a sex machine, she kept her motor clean; and  she told me to come, but i was already there.   Anywho. So last night (monday) I went out with another guy.  And this time I broke the only really important rule I had:  DON'T DATE SOMEONE YOU WORK WITH.   Well, I kind of broke it.  Because even though this guy, MR. Jack, works at my firm I don't actually work  with  him.  So it's not so bad.  Except that is.  Why? Because he is the nephew of a named partner.  For those of you not familiar the named partners are the top of the food change.  They're the lawyers with their names in the firm's name.    So Mr. Jack and I went out to see a rock show at the Whiskey A-go-go.  And I kissed him.  Actually, I was really surprised.  I think I actually like him.  I wasn't sure if I did at first.  Well that's not true.  I knew I liked him, but I wasn't sure I was attracted to him.  But I think i am.  I am certainly really comfortable around him.  After the show we went to a bar and shot pool and then we laid on the beach for an hour.  I guess it was a little cheesy.  But it was my idea and he didn't make fun of me for the cheesiness.  And it was nice.  Yes, I think I like Mr. Jack.    None of this was anything I wrote about in the lost post, which was titled "small loss."  The big loss was losing that post, because I am too fucking tired to re-create it now.    I will say this:  1) saw jack tonight 2) shahin called, didn't answer the phone 3) david called.  David is lonely and bored and he says he misses hanging out with me.  I admit that hearing his voice made me love him all over again.  But he is so confusing.  Am too tired to talk about it.  He says he plans on NOT sleeping with Shaina, shahana shana (whatever her name is).  I say, even if you don't plan on it happening, it might.  I don't know.  I miss him.    okAY. sleep is needed. This time I copy the text before attempting to publish

               ....... Her mind is Tiffany twisted  She's got the Mercedes bends  She's got a lot of pretty, pretty boys  That she calls friends  How they dance in the courtyard  Sweet summer sweat  Some dance to remember  Some dance to forget  So I called up the Captain  Please bring me my wine  He said  We haven't had that spirit here since 1969  And still those voices are calling from far away  Wake you up in the middle of the night  Just to hear them say         ...... [in case some one is not recognizing the reference, those are lyrics from  urlLink the eagles ' " urlLink hotel california "]  Well, fuck dancing, I need something a little heavier.  So I have moved onto... Fucking to forget.  I asked Mr. Saturday who he was fucking to forget, but I was too drunk and tired to remember what he said.  Sigh... I hope my parents never, ever, stumble across this blog.   Well. last night was another hook up.  Not a full on one-night stand (no sex involved), but definitely a hook up.  In fact, I'd never met the guy before last night.  But it's not as sleazy as it sounds (that's a confession, not a defense).  He is a roommate/classmate of an co-worker.  And he is also a summer intern at a prestigious law firm and a student at a "one of the nation's top law schools" (but not the one I go to).  I shall dub him Mr. Law Student.    I guess he's good looking.  Or rather I am sure that 98% of my friends would say that he is better looking than Mr. David.  But honestly, every time I am with anyone else, I can't help but think about how much I miss david.  Which means that this whole fucking to forget thing is NOT WORKING!.  God damnit!  I've tried drinking and smoking and screwing and crying and driving really fast and going out all the time and staying in and reading or playing guitar and NOTHING NOTHING seems to work.    Sigh.  But I did promise juicy details. So here they are  Height: taller than Mr. Saturday night, but not by much.  Maybe 5'8 Weight/body. Well built, but not overly bulky Complexion: sexily swarthy. Part hawaiian Face:  I can't tell if he's hot or not.  Sometimes he looks really good.  sometimes he looks like he has a bit of an overbite.   Attitude: total player.  uses some really bad lines.  but then comes through with moments of sincerity and seems almost trustworthy. And, of course, the all-important cock-size: average.  god damnit! fuck david for spoiling me.  Seriously, everything seems like a fucking disappointment, or a disappointing fuck, in comparison.  I should put a small word of encouragement in here.  I used to not care about size at all.  In fact, I used to perfer sizes on the smaller side of average because of the whole pain thing and because it was easier to do a lot a things (i.e., blow jobs).   [Jesus, I really hope my parents never stumble across this site! But just in case they do: yes, I am using protection, both hormonal and physical].  Anyway, i just don't want to give any one a complex about dick size.    Okay More Details:  The Best Worst Line of the Night: You can touch it, it's okay The Cheesiest Observation of the Morning:  I never fall asleep cuddling, but I did with you. The Strangest compliment:  You have nice skin.   [I guess it's not that strange, but it is starting to weird me out because every guy I have been with has said this.  I, personally, don't think my skin is all that different from anyone else’s.  It's not like I use moisturizers everywhere every day.  Is this just a line that guys use these days?  If there are any guys out there that want to fill me in on this, please leave a comment.  Or for that matter,  girls, do you also get this compliment a lot?]  Alright. I hope that's a little bit spicer than some of my other posts.  Two other news flashes before I go:  1) Rod continues to e=mail me. Thank god. I really thought he wasn't to cut off contact again after that last e-mail (in which I went out on a limb and mentioned that I missed him and that I thought he was the cat's pajamas, or something to that effect)  2) David continues to ignore me.  Phone tag.  I left a message and then erased his number from my phone (for the millionith time).    3) Mr. Saturday night called on friday night.  Maybe I already posted that.  Anyway, we are supposed to get together for dinner some time this week  4) Mr. Law School is supposed to take me out to dinner sometime this week too.  hmm... maybe I should try to swing dinner with one, drinks with the other, in the same night.  That might be exciting (of course, I wouldn't take the first one home, that's just too weird, even for me).

      Thanks to  urlLink Sev , the author of  urlLink Fire on the Lawn  for the tip on get a tracker. It was surprisingly easy.  Thanks also to  urlLink Grace , author of  urlLink pulp , for her supportive comments.  Before I get on to today's business, I have to say three things.  1) Sev has tapped into my Sunday anti-fetish.  Check out his 07/11 post,  urlLink half-arsed .  2) Grace also tends to write long, but interesting personal posts.  Actually, I shouldn't say also. because mine just tend to be long.  3) in the interest of upping my outgoing links volume I offer you this gem:  urlLink http://underneaththeirrobes.blogs.com/main/2004/07/07/index.html .  It's probably only really funny if you are a nerdy lawyer-type or lawyer-wanna be.    okay.  Now onto the juicy of details of my latest random hook up.  See the next post.

      Things I would like blogger to do for me because, ultimately, I am very lazy:  1) Spell checker.  I am a lousy speller.  They (whoever they are) say that spelling has no corrolation to intelligence.  That is probably true.  But I suspect that like any other talent/skill, the ability to spell can be improved with practice.  As annoying as  MSword is, I have to admit that I appreciate the appearance of the red underline squiggly when words are misspelled.  I think it has helped me improve a touch.  Anyway, if nothing else a spell checker would still be nice.  2) Visitor counter.  Yes yes, I know, we can manually change the template and alter our blogs by editing the code.  But I don't know how to do this.  And I desperately want to know exactly how few people visit my blog.    3) I also want to know who has been checking out my profile.  I know some of those visits were from myself (I was editing things and wanted to see how the changes looked...or maybe that is just a pathetic excuse for my vanity).  It'd be cool if there was some way to keep track of that.  Okay. That's it for now. Must go get ready.  Incidentally, if there are people out there actually reading this, I am dying to know.  Yes, yes, I know how pathetic that truly is.  and yes, yes, I know how uninteresting my life is.  but maybe if I thought i had a reader or to i could spice up the blog a bit.  or maybe not. it's not like the raw material (my life) is all that spicy.

      I heard some one say that the rarest moment is the present.  We tend to live in either the past or the future.  Mulling over the stupid things we said or did, analyzing why relationships went sour and what we could have done differently.  Or we waste time daydreaming about the better times to come.  The plans we have for the weekend or the new year or our retirement.  But rarely do we appreciate the moment.  Well I'm gonna try and do little mother fucking appreciation right now, but let me tell you, it's not as easy as it looks.   Right now, one of the only two dryers in my aparment complex is broken and I have 11 loads of laundry to do.  Wet clothing is hanging up all over my room and the fan is only full blast.  It's four-thirty, but at least it's saturday afternoon.  How's that for appreciation: at least it's not a god damn sunday.  okay, now that I got that whole living in the moment thing over with I will go back to my living in the past routine, two nights past to be specific.  Mr. Saturday night took me out on thursday.  It was my first one-night stand.  Technically I guess it wasn't a one-night stand, because I had actually met him thursday and he did indeed call me on friday.  But still, it was the first time I ever fucked somebody on the first date.  Honestly, i am usually shy about that sort of stuff, at least initially.    But... I am feeling awfully nihilistic lately.  So mr. s and I were at a bar, shooting pool drinking Jack and Coke and I was feeling antsy and contentious and I had to get out of the place (which was packed full of tools).  So we ended up back at my place and we started making out and I was drunk, but not so drunk I didn't know what I was doing.    It was the weirdest sex I have ever had.  I swore at him and he called me a fucking whore.  I told him to do whatever he wanted, he said he wanted to tear me apart.  I can't tell if I was playing his game or if he was playing mine, or if we were both just using each other.  Honestly, the sex was only mediocre.  He is not very well endowed.  I guess that sounds shallow and unfair. Maybe it is a little unfair.  to be truthful he is probably about average but... Well, I guess the real problem is that the sex was so fucking good with david that everything sort of sucks in comparison.  Anyway.  The weird thing is that I expected to feel really guilty about the whole situation, but I don't at all.  I don't really feel anything.  I'll probably see him again, if we ever connect that is.  We've been playing phone tag the last two days.    okay.  I have to go live in the moment again and finish up my fucking laundry.

      I feel sick.  It seems I am always sick.  Not sick as in: cough cough, itch in the back of the throat, snot dripping down,  but sick as in: feeling a little queasy, a little clammy, a little ill at ease  like I'm always nervous, or shakey, or suffering from low blood sugar or nicotine deprivation.  But it's none of those things.  It's love sickness.    Not love sick as in: ohhh I miss him so much, ohh I can't live without him but love sick as in: I can't hardly see straight because I am so irrationally angry at him (david) and everytime I play his fucking CD I want to drive off the side of the road or ram my car into a cement wall.    Or maybe love sick as in: Why can't I just leave him (rod) alone?  I know I am only going to cause more pain in the end, but he is so fucking cool and everytime he e-mails me, my heart feels as if it will explode because my pulse is racing so fast.  I am so confused I can't even type.  I feel like my thoughts are going so fast that I am getting motion sickness.  Maybe that's what this is.  Motion sickness.  I'm sick of all the back and forth, the uncertainity.    Well there are twenty three days until the last day of the month, and guess what day of the week that is?  It's a mother-fucking-sunday.  The last day of the month.  I don't even know if Shaniea, sahnei, shana, whatever, will be gone by then.  But I hope so.  I hope david makes up his wishy washy mind.    I hope I make up my mind.  I hope I can get my act together and clean up.  what a fucking mess.  it's hard for me to understand what rod ever saw in me.  or david for that matter.  fuck this.

      Or so they say.  I had to check my own blog to see where I left off.  It's tuesday, and this story goes back to saturday.  Saturday afternoon: Went to the beach with Bekah.  Had a grand time.  I went in the water for the first time.  Pooh-pooh to all of those southern californians who say the water is cold.  It's not.  It's fucking warm and you are all spoiled.  Washington beaches are cold.   Saturday night.  Susy, Bekha and I took off for wild night of drinking. I left my car at susy's and brought stuff to spend the night.  That meant i could get drunk drunk drunk. Which is exactly what I did.  I met some guy in the bar ( urlLink st. nicks ) .  Spent an hour and a half making out with him and earned the nickname, KM, short for Kissing Monster.  I guess I didn't bother posting this, but something very similar happened thursday night at  urlLink the white lotus .  But the saturday night was much cooler.  and younger.  and smelled better.  Sunday afternoon: shopping at the grove.  spent way too much money but got some very cute stuff.  all black, of course.  Sunday evening: the dreaded fourth of july.  Went to a firm event.  Fancy house, fancy party, boring conversation.  I did end up hanging out with mr. JAQ. Okay, that's not his real name, it's his initials.  His real name is john, but that gets confusing because there are a ton of johns at work, so he goes by his middle name.  but he hates his middle name.  So I started calling him "jack" spelled, JAQ, which works, because for whatever reason jack is a nickname for those named john.  weird.  Anyway, I think Mr. Jaq is developing an interest in me.  It's hard to say, though.  My dear readers must find me extremely self-centered since all I talk about are boys.  I'm not though. Okay, I am self-centered, but in an insecure self-doubting sort of way.  It still amuses me that a boy might be interested in me.  Monday afternoon:  More beach. This time down in Venice. The water is a little dirtier than santa monica but the beach is way less crowded.  I bought a body board and looked like a complete idiot trying to figure out how to use it.  Also.  Bekha, rebecca and I walked up and down the little beach strip.  I bought a cowboy hat. tres exciting.  An observation:  most people who wear just a bikini top and shorts/skirt when walking shouldn't, because most people look fat when they do that.  Of course, I was guilty of doing the same damn thing. and I probably looked fat too. It's really hard to suck in your gut without any support from your clothing.    Monday night: Had a lovely dinner with the lovely miss rebecca. Called Mr. Saturday night (the guy from  urlLink st. nicks ).  No answer.  too bad.  went to bed.  Tuesday:  Went to work.  Worked.  Went home.  Sorted my laundry.  My GOD! it is really gross how many articles of clothing I have acquired.  Here are my piles of laundry, all full loads mind you:  1 pile of pink 1 pile of purple 1 pile of browns 1 pile of blues and greens 1 pile of whites 1 pile of black pants 1 pile of black tops 1 pile of black dresses/skirts 1 pile of jeans 1 pile of sporty stuff 1 pile of jackets/sweat shirts  11 loads of laundry.  jesus.  And that's only five weeks worth of clothing.  But I guess that isn't too out of proportion.  that's like two loads a week.  I just haven't done laundry in five weeks...  Okay.  So onto the part about the good news coming in threes.  Mr. David e-mailed me monday night Mr. Rod e-mailed me tuesday afternoon and Mr. Saturdaynight called me tonight.   Hell yeah.  Okay. so mr. david barely wrote anything at all.  He did say that he "missed hanging out with me."  I guess that's okay.  I would have rather he said, "i miss you" but I'll take what I can get. and besides he's a dude and I over analyze everything  Which is why i love mr. rod.  Because he also overthinks everything.  And he sent me an Amazing e-mail.  In fact all of his e-mails are amazing. I should get his permission to post them.  because he is fucking funny.  and sweet. and I miss him.  sigh.  I miss david too.  I guess I understand how david could say that he loved his girlfriend and still bang me.  and still tell me that he cares about me.  Because I do care about david, and want to screw him and maybe even I love him.  and at the same time, I know i love rod. and if I really thought there was a shot at us being together I would probably go for it too.  that's a little bit depressing, I guess.  It certainly doesn't give me much hope for the david situation.  BUT fuck that shit.  Because I have a HOT date on thursday night with mr. saturdaynight.  Who, incidentally, is a med student at UCLA. So he's smart.  And he smells good.  Actually, he may smell too good, becuase he wears the same stuff that andy wore:  urlLink fahrenheit  by dior. I am a sucker for that stuff.  I really is like a love potion.   I hope Mr. Saturdaynight is as good looking and good smelling and funny and smart as he appeared to be when I first met him. That may be an unreasonable expectation as I was drunk.  We shall see.

      Off to the beach.  Remembered sunscreen.  Ms. Bekah is going with me. Tres Exciting.  Reminders for future posts:  Living emotional paycheck to emotional paycheck. Naive cynicism. Dreamscapes and emotional residue

      Four formerly innocent objects I cannot now encounter without bittersweet nostalgia:  1.  The coin-operated machines filled with stuffed animals and a hanging steel claw, which only the most deft of denny's going suburbanites can master   2. Dunhill cigarettes  3. Old English 40s  4. White four-door toyotas

      It has come to my attention that I am unfaithful only to things I care most about.  I forget my family member's birthdays I take on a lover (Mr. NYU) even though I am already in love with some one else (David) Then I forget my new lover's birthday When I am attending the wedding of a girl I have known since the first grade, I finding myself desperately wishing to be somewhere where else.  I can't even maintain this fucking blog, even though I am plagued by the need to write.  And now I am being called off to attend to business.  In brief, nothing is alright right now.  David is an asshole, Mr. NYU is just about perfect and I am shallow and stupid because I am still in love with the former and am still putting the latter on hold.
