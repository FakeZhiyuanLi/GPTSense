       i find this few days quite relax.. coz there's no homework to be handed in.. haha.. oh man.. there's physics and ss and history test tomorrow and i'm still slacking here.. nah.. do i look like i care..? no right.. just leave it the way it is..    i was so tired today.. no choice.. the performance is just around the corner and we've not met the target.. guess i shouldn't be too easy on them afterall.. not much progress is seen today, though.. i still feel that we can make it.. coz of the one and only sentence from mdm ow.. "Chinese Dance is the Number ONE CCA in Riverside.." haha.. wow..? surprise huh.. no.. it isn't.. this "number one" was earned by our hardworking seniors.. yes.. and it's my job to keep on carry the name so as to remain in number one..    after the practise.. ha.. my face is shiny.. my arms are shiny.. my legs are shiny.. and you know what.. it's all sweat.. wadde hell.. -.- and my hair was wet and i look like sadako with cut hair.. zZz..      was walking home alone after the practise.. suddenly i thought of something.. "I control no one.. And no one can ever control me" .. ya.. it's a motto of my own.. and i'm still wondering why i suddenly thought of that.. well.. maybe it's because i saw a little boy playing remote control car in the middle of the road.. haha.. oh my god.. why do sentences like this keep poping out of my mind..      after i had finished my tuition.. hey.. i receive a very heart warming message from a girl.. hmm.. a girl whom i've just made friend with.. well.. come on.. just a message.. it could mean nothing.. so don't get jealous huh.. haha.. =P

       hmm.. first entry huh.. well.. what i'm gonna say is.. today is just another ordinary sunday.. *oh i'm f~r~e~e~z~i~n~g~* yes.. isn't it just another ordinary sunday that we have to go through in our lifes.. and i wonder who's the idiot that came out with "monday" and all this sort of things.. it's crap to me.. but it doesn't matter now does it.. afterall.. i'm already sixteen and i've gone through.. let me count.. one.. two.. 835 sundays..      wow.. am i so old.. hmm.. whatever.. i don't think it affects me ya.. i only hope that the time keeper of my life could end it soon huh? coz i've been tolerating all sorts of bullshit that is appearing in my life constantly.. ya.. i'm destined to be a stupid child with a stupid life having all the stupid thing aruond me at the start of the count..      although i'm used to it.. but in other people's eyes.. "poorthing" and "dramastic" aren't a good word to describe me.. and i'm still waiting for the rightful word to suit the rightful me..    look at the time.. time for tuition again.. guess i'm going again to tolerate the crazy jokes and ideas of my teacher and junior huh.. ya.. this is all for the "Start of The Count"   ..
