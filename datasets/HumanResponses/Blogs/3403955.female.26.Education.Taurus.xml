      I know what I want and I am waiting for it. In the meantime I trying to be content. I am truly blessed and have a full life. But inside there is an ache a longing and I am trying to make it go away but it just wants to stay. I have this passion and desire to find that person who compliments me and who I am compliment in the best way. A man to support and care for. Someone who will think I am full of grace and beauty.Someone who will cause me to laugh and smile ( not that difficult, I laugh at the drop of a hat!) Someone who will help me find contentment.........or do I have to find my contentment first?

      The sun is out and the sky is blue the day would only be better if I were spending it with you. Your goofy grin and the way you call me kid. You make me happy, you make it feel right. The way you joke and talk seriuous with me there is no one with whom I would rather be. The only thing is you see me as a sister not as a woman to brag about "hey I kissed her". I am the friend who will always be not the one you will come to on bended knee.

      Have you ever felt like no one cares? I mean I know there are people who love and care for me but I have gone so far away from all of them I am not sure what to do. I have gone away to new places before, none as different as this before though. I have always been able to make friends and find my niche but lately, here in the middle of no where, I seem to be the odd girl out. My co-workers while most of them are nice I just don't seem to click and form that bond of friendship. I love living on a college campus but the summers suck!There is no one here except the staff. I think its harder cause I am in small town USA... It's hot and windy and no one wants to go outside. Well all this complaining and while it's true I think I am just venting.... too lonely I guess. The terror of a small town... only a couple of more years though. Op la di Op la da!

      The storm clouds rolled in yesterday They were there in the blink of an eye At first I thought them exciting, something new, a break from the light But as they steam rolled through the sky Their dinge flattening the color of the world The volcano of darkness began to well up in side me I poured water on my fears hoping to cool them And four a while the darkness lay dormant Till the clouds began to roar with pride The deep rumblings broke the crust and allowed the lava to flow through me I began to burn from the inside out.  As I fell to the ground all hope lost a rray of light pierced the thick dark clouds The light enveloped the darkness inside me using it for it's purpose. But before it did it asked me if it was okay. Was it okay? I weighed my options did I want to be ruled by the anger and hatred and uneding fear that this dark volcano caused or did I want to give in to the light. This light that shone through me whether I was going to follow it's agenda or not. This light that not only engulfed the darkness in me but allowed me to dispell darkness from others. This light that freed me from the bondage of the darkness?  Of course it was okay. Now the darkness in side has subsided and is daily being erraticated by the light.  The clouds still role in and out and clap and roar with pride But the difference is that now they fear the light inside me. I don't fear the darkness inside them.

      I have always been afraid to start this particular journey. I am not sure what of failure or dissatisfaction. I am still going to be able to enjoy. I also am a little afraid about becomeing obsessive. Especially since so many people I know are obsessed once thay get on this journey. Seeing mom let me believe that I have the abilitiy to get on this journey. Even if it means changing my life a little bit.

      When I talk to you, I smile.You break me down in away very few have been able to break through or have tried. It scares me. I am not sure if it is you I am scared of or thought of you rejecting me that I am scared of. If I risk it, if I open myself up to you what will you do. I know on the outside I appear to be stong but inside I am easily broken fragile to the touch. The even scarier thing is if I risk it and you don't brek me with a rejection will our friendship with stand the shock? Is it worth risking our friendship? I risked it once before and was rejected, lost everything including part of my ability to trust and rely on people. I know you are not him. I know that you have a very gentle touch with matters of the heart. But can you take the amount of pressure I tend to place on others do you want to? or will you shoot me through the heart and kill me like a silver bullet going theough a werewolf? You stir something in me and I don't know what to do. Thousands miles away and my thoughts constantly drift to you. The way you know just what to say, How you can make me smile eveeryday, You reach for the stars and have a childlike presence about you, Is there anything you can't do?

      Today, a Tuesday that feels like a monday and I am sitting here writing in my blog putting off the things I should do. Not that they can't wait but why put off for tomorrow what you can accompish today? It seems that this town has this hold over me. It slows the speed of life. It slows my desire to do much of anything. I sit and ponder and think about all that goes on and all who interact with me. WHat is their purpose in my life? What is mine in theirs? I know that I am put here for a reason and that everyday I have the oppurtunity to live that out. I feel different somehow though. Am I in the valley coming down from the mountain? When I reach the depths of the valley will I remeber what I learned on the mountain or will turn away? I want to be that strong to stand firm and assure like I did when i was on the mountain but as I begin to journey down the hill as I know I must go I lose my focus, I begin to lose my sight. Keep hold of me on my journey place people and things in my life that anchor me to you in a way like never before. Grab hold and don't let go. FOr even if I bite the hand that feeds me sometimes I never want you to let go. I never want to be apart from you.

      I know there is no real possibility. Us being miles apart. But when I dream I dream of you. A dream so sweet it make me think all of my dreams can come true. My dreams are quite simple, just me being honest with you. Something I would hope to do someday for real, to be able to tell you. Tell you how I feel when ever your around. What your smile does to me or when I see you standing in a door. Just the thought of you give me tingles all over and causes my heart to speed. You always know just what to say you always know what I need. My fear of telling you my true thoughts and feelings? Quite simple I am not sure if the risk is worth losing. I have risked before and lost not just the hope but the friendship that was built. I would rather care for you from up close then have you not like me from a distance. So I call you friend and share your joys and such. If one day it would work then that time will come to be. Till then as a friend I will be happy for you as you are for me.

      I was quite giddy at the thought the possibility of what this vist might be what it could be. And at first it was what I had hoped for and it was good. BUt then you pushed and pressed and I extended myself beyonf my bounds. I became very uncomfortable. I hoped that you would leave or that we would be able to create some common ground with which toi restart. The thing was that never happened and silence hung in the air like a never lifting fog weighed down by the expectations I had upheld. When you couldn't meet them the expectations became to great and the fogged dropped down upon us. I was so relieved when you left it was so freeing. The fog ran away and once again the day seemed bright. But now a new weight has settled upon my shoulders. This one is the question of what to do. DO I let you go or do I keep trying? I am not sure, I am not sure what I want and I am not sure what to do. I am hoping time will help clarify some of these misexpectations.

      IT seemed to go well. I think everything worked out but I can't say that I think there were people holding back not being honest. As a group we have done so little to discover each other to build up each other I am not sure this was enough. I do believe it was a good start however. As long as everyone stays open and honest to it. Or at very least evertone learns to be quiet.
