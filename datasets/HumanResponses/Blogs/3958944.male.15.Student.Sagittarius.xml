       It feels good to be back in my own house. Today seems so uneventful compared to yesterday, though. I want to do something; but I don't know what that something is...

       First off, I decided to make a blogger account because everyone else I know is either using livejournal or xanga, and quite frankly, I don't want to be like everyone else.      Secondly, I've quite possibly had the best week ever.    As of last Sunday, my mom and I have been house sitting at her bosse's house due to the fact that they're in Utah for a softball tournament, and the two dogs that they have need to be taken care of.  I figured this would be a good time to invite Allie over, since I hadn't seen her in the first two weeks she was in AZ because I'm an idiot.  Here's the basic run down of week:    Monday - Nothing too interesting.  The oh-so original sit on your ass and do nothing day.    Tuesday - First day with Allie.  We went out to an Italian resturant (the name of which escapes me at the moment) first, and then headed out to AZ Mills, where we spent about two hours, despite the fact that we only went into two stores.    Wednesday - Movie night.  We rented Butterfly Effect, which was suprisingly good.  Since when could Kutcher act?  After the movie, Allie and I sat and talked for two-ish hours.  Needless to say, that was much fun.    Thursday/Friday - See Monday.    Today - Woke up, walked the dogs, and then got ready for a whole day with Allie.  Picked her up around eleven, and then went out for breakfast at Dennies.  Afterwards, we went to the mall again.  However, this time we went to Superstition Springs instead of AZ Mills.  I think she was mad at me for a bit when I bought her a book she wanted, even though she had the money to pay for it, though.  I do what I can.  We had planned on going to Polar Ice; but with Dennies and the mall, there was no time to get there for public skating.  Instead, we came back to the house and swam for bit.  Then I got to spend some quality time with my one and only until she had to leave.    Now I have to wait until Wednesday to see her again, and she leaves on Thursday... I really don't know what I'm going to do without her.  There'll be next summer, though.  I'll be heading out to Europe with Allie, my 8th grade social studies teacher, and a group of some other kids that I don't know for three weeks.  That's still a long way away, though.  Ah well, I'll find some way to last until then.
