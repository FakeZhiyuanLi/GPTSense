       You forgive me for liking you too much, And I'll forgive you for not liking me enough.  You forgive me for missing you, And I'll forgive you for being so cold.  You forgive me for the beating of my heart, And I'll forgive you for not hearing it.  You forgive me for playing your games, And I'll forgive you for toying with my emotions.  You forgive me for finding you so attractive, And I'll forgive you for not noticing.  You forgive me for raising you up so high, And I'll forgive you for bringing me down so low.  You forgive me for wanting to be with you, And I'll forgive you for avoiding me.  You forgive me for being so pathetic, And I'll forgive you for taking advantage of it.  You forgive me for not being able to let go, And I'll forgive you for never having latched on.  You forgive me for having hopes and dreams, And I'll forgive you for crushing them.  Forgiveness brings inner peace. Do we have a deal?

       An awkward hello   Follows a difficult goodbye   Too much time spent   Searching for those perfect words.      Until we meet again...   In this life or another   A piece of my heart   Will always be with you   Begging for your soft touch   Pieces of my thoughts   Will always be with you   Begging for the answer...what if?

       My words left unspoken   Untold and alone   Left as a secret   Written in stone.   Whispering softly   Through ears that don't hear   Will he ever know   Why to love brings me fear?   To think is to speak   Like breath is to air   Forgotten in time   Left in despair.   When life is determined   By the beat of a heart   The truth will be spoken   And with a kiss   We'll depart.

        (For my Peachy girl...love you *muah*)     With you, it's all about voiceless communication. Always knowing exactly what to say, but never actually having to say it.    When no one seems to be listening, you hear. When I hurt but don't show it, you know. When I turn away to hide my tears, you see. When I feel like I can't get through to anyone, you understand.    You flash your warm, healing smile my way, and I know everything will be all right.    You know everything there is to know about me. You know what worries me, what keeps me up at night, and what shames me so badly that I can't share it with anyone. Most importantly, though, none of those things bother you.    You've restored my faith in people and proven to me that true friendship really does exist.

       I am a goddess In every part of me My lips, my eyes, my hair, my thighs If only you could see.    Maybe abstract beauty Nowhere near perfection Round and full, alive and whole Do you think you could make an exception?    Whatever happened To the beauty within the heart The love, the strength, the honesty That sets us all apart?    Everyone has a need To love and be loved in return But superficial expectations Leave us to crash and burn.    I appear to be nothing like her So delicate and petite But I am still a woman From my head down to my feet.    We laugh the same, we cry the same Have hopes and dreams and fears We long to have a hand to hold And shed the same small tears.    But life is so much sweeter For her, than it is for me For outer beauty, not heart and soul Is all the world can see.    So I ask just one more time As you glance in my direction Could you see the goddess in me And possibly make an exception?

      Ok...fair warning for you...another vent from Andrea.  Do you know what  really, really  pisses me off? No? Well...let me tell you.    Ignorant people who DO NOT have children, trying to give you advice on how to raise yours!         I can't even begin to tell you how much this pisses me off! Take today for example: I'm at the store with Taelar, and she's being a bugger. She's a high-strung, stubborn, opinionated 8-yr-old...gets those traits quite naturally, I must admit. I'm taking my time, wandering around the store, and she's getting bored. She starts in on wanting to leave, so I explain to her nicely that I have a few more things to pick up, then we will go. She then asks for me to buy her this cheap, dollar store kinda toy, way freakin over-priced, and my answer was No. Apparently, this wasn't cool either, because her life depended on her having this new cool toy to get stuffed in her closet along with all the other ones that she's played with once and got bored with! So, she pitches a bit of a fit, whining, feet-stomping, the whole bit, then starts with the tears. At this point, I'm frustrated beyond all belief, and when you're frustrated, and your child is frustrated, a normal conversation is pretty much out of the question. So, I bend down, grab her by the shoulders (to stop the freakin) and explain to her, in not exactly the friendliest of tones, that it must stop, or she will be spending the day in her room upon returning home. I'm not having much luck calming her down, so I'm trying to get all my shit and get out of there, when this woman, out of nowhere, walks up to me and proceeds to tell me that "yelling" at my child in a public place is inapropriate, and that it will cause emotional scars, bla bla bla. She then tells me all about her recently acquired  child psychology degree  and how she learned this and that, and knows what she is talking about...and ends with "I just thought I may be able to help you out."  Now, this is where my Ally McBeal moment kicked in. The vision of me grabbing onto the bitch's perfect blonde hair and spinning her above my head and tossing her 2 aisles over. But, I'm not violent...I am a reasonable woman. So I say to her, "Does it work with your kids?" And her answer?  "Oh, I don't have kids yet..."     I swear, by this time, you can almost SEE the steam barelling out of my ears, as I throw my purchases on the counter in front of the giggling cashier, who is trying her best not to laugh, and calmly (I'm so proud of myself) explain to this dumbass childless woman that until she has a child, and goes through what every mother/father on the face of the planet goes through, her "degree" is useless. It may help her to piss people off, but will do absolutely no good to her in a real life situation...so in future, she may want to refrain from giving her opinion in a situation where it is not needed, or appreciated.  *whew* Ok...I'm calm now...but I swear, I wanted to rip the bitch a new one...lol I'm done venting now!

      Ok...so...I met this guy.  Met him about a week ago, and he seemed really freakin cool. Very sweet, very charming, very friendly. And the best part - he only lives about an hour away! Totally do-able.  So we have a nice long chat, talk about our lives, doing the "getting to know each other" thing, and I'm thinking, "This is cool...maybe even super cool." He tells me that he's going away for a few days, and we make plans to chat when he gets back.  So last night...he comes back. We decide that maybe it would be cool to meet sometime...see if we actually "clicked" in real life. Kinda scary...but kinda exciting all at the same time. So we work something out, plan to meet, but not for a few weeks, due to sitter issues on my end. But it's cool, he says I'm worth waiting for...(damn right!)  But then...he suddenly turns all creepy and possessive on me...like I'm his freakin property. Let me just remind you that we have  NEVER  met before. He's now talking about how I  "may be stuck with him for the next 30 years or so..."  and how I'm his  "new honey.."  and how he thinks that he's found  "the best thing in the world"  bla bla bla.  Am I just a bitch? Am I just getting paranoid about someone showing that much interest in me? Here I am, alone...and I'm bitching that someone is diggin me...doesn't seem quite right. Maybe it's the whole "30 years" comment...because, quite honestly, as I said yesterday, at the moment I am SO not relationship material. I wish I was. I wish that my head was on straight, and that my heart was in the position to really open up to someone...but it's not. I wish that I was filled with confidence and ready to give all that I am to someone...but I'm not. But on the other hand, I could really go for some lovin' right about now...my freaky skills are getting rusty...and we can't let that happen!  Which brings me to my next point.  The hook-up.   How is it that when that's all I want...I can't find a naughty man anywhere. And when I meet someone...and let my wall down, and put my heart into it...it seems all  they  want is to "have fun." I can't begin to tell you how many times THAT'S happened!  I swear...Men and Women...such an odd pair. Is it possible to find a man who can say, right from the start, what he's all about? Lay everything on the line, put everything on the table...without the frustration and games? (Ok...well maybe there's one...but Billy's already taken...lol)  I swear...if there's some big mysterious secret here...to figuring them out...PLEASE...someone...let me in the loop.

        mirror, mirror on the wall   show me what you see   if you really reflect it all   show every piece of me   behind my eyes, behind my smile   deep into my soul   linger for a little while   show me all you know   not just a figure standing here   reveal all that's inside   show me, even though i fear   here and now, it's time   show the bruised and battered place   the piece that just can't cope   the part that longs to be set free   the side where life's a joke   the innocence behind the sin   the adult inside the child   the heart that won't let anyone in   the piece of me that's mild   the place in me that's always red   the part that's forever blue   the side that follows what is said   the piece that's always confused   the place in me that thinks i'm right   the part that knows i'm wrong   the side that's bloated up with pride   the piece that can't go on   the coward inside the fighter   the genius next to the dumb   the part that's drunk with laughter   the side that shies from fun   so mirror, mirror on the wall   i'll step back so i can see   if you really reflect it all   and show every piece of me.

      Yep. Definitely all coupled-out after a 3-day weekend with Nancy and Billy. As much as I hate to say that...and how ridiculous it sounds...it's true.  I've spent so much time lately looking inside myself and trying to find out who I really am...and who I really want to be...trying to make some much needed changes in my life. But then, all of a sudden, I wake up and there they are, in  new relationship mode , doing the sweet (borderline sickening) things that new couples do...and I find myself really, really missing that. As much as I complain about the never ending "smoochy-crap" and the constant gushing of how wonderful each other is...I can't help but wish that, for once, I was the one doing the gushing.  But it really, really sucks to know that no matter how much you want something, there are times in your life when you simply could not handle them. This is one of those times for me. There is nothing I would love more than to have someone in my life right now, but I know, without a doubt, if it happened today...we'd only be headed for disaster. I know, as much as I hate to admit it, that I am not capable of putting 100% into a relationship...and giving it all that I have. I truly believe that self-love and self-confidence are the keys to not only a successful life...but a successful relationship. And as for me...well, I'm working on it!  The weight is dropping...quickly *insert big YAY for Nancy here, lol*  and I'm slowly starting to feel better and better. I'll be back to  good 'ol Andrea  in no time...you can bet on that!  This self-reflection thing isn't so bad...kinda wish I would have tried it a long time ago...

      Well, I have to say...I'm in a much better mood today. It's always nice when you realize that you've suddenly come out of one of those occasional "blah" periods. Yay for me!  Soo...spent the night last night chatting with some new friends. Some very "super cool" new friends. It's funny how you meet people every day, but in one place in particular, for some unknown reason, you meet a ton of them that are just cooler than you ever imagined. Gotta love that!  Speaking of super cool...gotta give a big "yahoo!" to Nancy and Billy, my favourite new "couple" hehe. I've said it before, but I think it's worth saying again... I love you guys, and I can't think of anything more incredible than 2 of my best friends...finding happiness with each other.  BUT - on a more sadistic and threatening note: Remember - if either one of you gets hurt -  someone  is going to die. Believe that.  So yeah...now that I've briefly gone into bitch mode, thought I'd share something. For those of you that know me well...I'm sure you'll get quite the laugh out of this one!     BITCHDOM

      Ok...after my self-pitying "poor me" first entry...I thought I'd try to be optimistic this time, and list the new rules I've set out for my life. Change is good...  1. Give people more than what they expect, and do it cheerfully. 2. When you say "I love you"...mean it. 3. Believe in love at first sight. 4. Never laugh at anyone's dreams. 5. Love deeply and passionately. You may get hurt, but it's the only way to live completely. 6. Don't judge people by their relatives. 7. Talk slowly, but think quickly. 8. Remember that greater love and greater achievements involve greater risks. 9. Call Mom and Dad. 10. When you lose, don't lose the lesson. 11. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship. 12. Marry a man that you love to talk to. As you get older, their conversational skills will be as important as any other. 13. Spend time alone. 14. Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values. 15. Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer. 16. Live a good, honourable life. When you get older, you'll look back and enjoy it a 2nd time. 17. Read between the lines. 18. Be gentle with the earth. 19. Don't interrupt when you are being flattered. 20. Don't trust a man who doesn't close his eyes when you kiss. 21. Learn the rules...then break some. 22. Remember the best relationship is one where your love for each other is greater than your need for each other. 23. Remember that your character is your destiny. 24. Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon. And finally... 25. Never frown...because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.

      Yep. At least that's what I had hoped for! A bit of recent news on my life...just to get you caught up to speed...  About 7 or 8 months ago, I moved from London, Ontario to Blenheim, Ontario - a town of about 4000 people. Don't ask me WHY, because the only answer that I can give is that it was a bout of temporary insanity! I thought moving here would be a new beginning for me, something to help me get out of the rut that my life had been in, both financially and emotionally. A new home, a new job, a new start...new beginning for Andrea. But no such luck.  I am forced to deal with my ex's constant nagging about the fact that I moved his daughter away from him...a whole whopping hour away! Because...in fact...he is incapable of finding/keeping a steady job, so therefore has no license, and no money to ensure that he has her on his scheduled weekends. It has somehow become MY responsibility to make sure that he sees her...because...I was the one who decided to move...ok then...  So every other weekend, I spend the $40 and Taelar and I make the familiar bus trip to London via Greyhound. Do you think I ever see any of that $40 from him? Or any child support or clothing for Taelar or anything of that sort? You guessed it...nothing. If I sound a bit bitter...it's cause I am! How is it right that I'm the one who provides for her, who is in constant battle with her 8-year-old "know it all" stubbornness, who has to discipline her...and he gets to play Super Dad and do all the fun stuff. Talk about having it made! He wants all of the rights...but none of the responsibility. And to top it all off...because of the fact that he is on welfare...I can't touch him. Can't get one red cent outta him. But I'M the bad guy who moved his daughter away from him to try to better our lives...funny how that works, isn't it?  But all in all...to be completely truthful...my weekends in London are a breath of fresh air for me. When Taelar is having fun times with Super Dad, I get the chance to actually be around my friends again...who I miss SO immensely when I'm home. I've never really had that feeling of being completely and utterly alone before...until recently. It's definitely not something that I enjoy, or something that I would ever wish on anyone...not even Super Dad. The feeling that if something should happen...there's no one's door you could show up to for that much needed hug or word of encouragement. I miss that.  But I have great friends. Three of them are of the best I've ever known...although I don't know that I've ever really told them that.  Nancy - who I've known since I was 15...who has the shoulder that never tires and the ears that never stop listening...even when they probably want to. Just can't picture my life without her...my 'lil peach...lol Rachel - my partner in crime :) We've been through a lot together, both good and bad...but somehow, we always manage to bring it back to what's important...the strength of our friendship. Thankfully! And Billy - the greatest hugger on the face of the planet, and the one who can read me like no other...kinda scary, but it's nice to know that someone can TELL what you're feeling...without you having to explain it.  So all in all, I guess it's safe to say that my life doesn't exactly suck...although I have my "pity me" moments. But don't we all?  And now on a lighter note...   My Yahoo Astrology Horoscope for today says:   You're in the mood to chat -- but do confine it to light, easy topics. This isn't the very best day to have a serious talk. Dreaming out loud about a cruise or a seaside vacation, however, would work just fine.   Chatting...been doing that a lot lately...and like a wise man once said..."to the new friends we meet in the strangest of places..." Don't think those "new friends" have any idea how therapeutic they have been for me...and how amusing :)  So...I think I've vented enough for one day...I'm off to daydream about that seaside vacation now...
