      Finally! After three days, of being mega-bored, because my mom wanted the computer to play her stupid games.... But now, she's gone for the evening, so it's mine, MINE, HAHAHAHHAAAA!! And my father solved the problem I had with Adobe Illustrator, so I could finally finish the cat is was vectorising... I don't know if you know the one I mean, but it is the one from the poster of  le chat noir , of  Rodolphe Salis .  So what did I do the past few days whitout my dear deeaaar computer? I read some comic books (again) such as  De Cartografen ,  Roxalane  and some albums of  Storm . Another thing I did, was watching some DVD's I wanted to see again,  The meaning of Life  (yes, I know, again...), some episodes of  Blackadder  (the complete second series, and the first two episodes of the third). For those under you that aren't familiar with Lord Edmund Blackadder visit the official site:  urlLink http://www.blackadderhall.co.uk/

      Got up at 12:25 pm today after my mam came yelling in my room to get me awake. I jumped into my clothes and when i came downstares i noticed that we were going to BBQ today. I don't like BBQ, it's a litle barbaric i think, just roasting meat on a fire, just like our ancestors did thousands of years ago, and that may sound like fun, going back to our "roots", but i dn't like it. I love my comfort too much, and comfort and BBQ don't go together for me. Another thing i don't like on BBQ is he fact that it is something that you do  outside , and i really don't like the idea of sitting in the sun. So right after lunch, i fled inside, after my computer, with the excuse is was doing some research for one of our guests about  psoriasis . Three hourrays for Google! The rest of the afternoon was so fuckin boring, i don't even want to describe it here...  Now i am watching a documentary with my parent about  Asia after dark . I think  bizarre  is the word that fits best for this kind of docu. A lot of sex, Japanese fetisches and other weird things that happen there. You must have seen this to believe it really happens.

      Today was really boring, the only thing that wasn't, was watching the extras on some DVD's I've got, and the only reason I did was to see that I didn't die out of boringness...  The first one was  Harry Potter and the philosofers stone , wich had some really nice extra's, I especially liked the deleted scenes wich you were able to see if you reached the stone. It was interesting to see some things that were mentioned in the book, but not in the film. Other things that you could see were tours on Hogwarts, buying a wand, catching the snitch, etc...  The second one was  The meaning of life , a film by Monty Python. I really love these people, because the make great Britisch humour and the extra's on this DVD were just like how you would expect them: bizarre, and most of the time hilarious! You can see how the film was cleaned up, how it was promoted, how it was made, etc...  Third and last one was  The Quest for the holy grail , also by Monty Python. You can see a scene from the movie made in Lego (fantastic!), karaoke versions of the songs, the many uses of coconuts, how to be a good monk ( Pie Lesu Domine, Dona Eis Requiem ), and a very interesting documentary about the locations used in the film, where you can see how it is possible to use one castle more than one times for more than one locations, discover stairs that aren't stares, corridors that aren't corridors, etc...  Think that was it, so goodbye, and don't forget to smile when the brother of the baker's nephew's mother in law's aunty's doctor's girlfriend passes by!
