      Current Mood: Loved Current Music: "Truly, Madly, Deeply," Savage Garden  Nathan is in the shower, so I am sitting at his computer in his room, waiting for him to take me home, and stay with me there until tomorrow evening. It's been so wonderful so far. It had been so long since I had seen him, I had almost forgotten the taste of his kiss and the feel of his skin against mine. Yesterday we went to his Father's family reunion. It was alright. When they announced the additions/subtractions, which everyone's family seems to do but mine, Nathan made me stand up and he introduced me as his girlfriend (his father introduced me as "Nathan's sweetheart" LOL). Apparently I "made a hit" as his Father said on the ride back because his grandmother hugged me and Beth told Nathan to treat me like a lady. His Dad really likes me I think. We talked on the 2-hour ride back home, he talked mostly but I threw in a comment every now and then. I think we get along well and he seems to like me. I even think his Mom hates me less now. LOL. Apparently her Father thinks I'm cute, so I guess that's good...  I spent a lot of time the past few days trying to decide just what it was I loved about him. I came up with a gigantic list, but only one reason. Every moment he does something new that I love and I make a note of them, but they all blur together into one thing: Him. It's just the way he is, just his being, and I love it and I love him more than anything else in all this world.   I love the way the "you" in "I love you" has that hint of desperation while his arms are wrapped around me. I love the way it's a half whisper that gets louder at the end. I love the way when he says it, I can feel that he means it. I love the way that's all I feel from him, no matter how angry he is.   I love the rhythm of his breathing against my face and my body, and the way his hand rests right under my arm when we sleep. I love the way he looks at me from his perch above me, eyes full of love and hands full of passion. I love the way he likes to look down at me from way up there, no matter how ugly I think I am. I love the way all my modesty is gone when he touches me, how I feel no shame in his presence because I know he thinks I'm beautiful.   I love the way he cares about me and my happiness more than his own, and the way I do the same thing. I love the way it's all I can do not to cry when he holds me. I love knowing he loves me, feeling he loves me, and hearing him say he always will. I love the way I love him, all of him, wholly and completely, with all my being, his every move and word and thought and emotion.   And I love the way he loves me, too.

      Current Mood: Thoughtful Current Music: "The Reason," Hoobastank  Well by this point everyone in town knows about Matt. It's been on the news and everyone knows he graduated in 2003, so I've been berated with questions about him all the time. I've pretty much got my speal down now. I tell everyone the same thing in the same tone. It's almost enough to make me forget the horror of it all.   Almost.  But it really got me to thinking about my mortality, and about the point of all this crap. Basically the only reason to be a good person is pride, and the fact that if I were not, no one would ever love me, including the one person whose love means more than anything. Other than that, there's not much point. We should just do as we please, then die, then come back, remembering nothing, and do it all over again. What's a little pain for ourselves and others? It's all only temporary. As Melissa Etheridge once said, "The only thing that stays the same is change." And it's very true. But she missed one little detail.  One thing will not change, I feel confident of that now. Nathan and I are meant to be together, and I will always love him, through every life we ever lead, and he will love me, and we will be together. Forever. That's the only reason for me anymore. He is my reason.   "I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be,  A reason to start over new,  And the reason is you."   Really, what other reason do I need but love? Since he is my only love, I need nothing else, no one else. They say you need food and shelter, pah! I say. I need Nathan. That's all. I need him to hold me and be with me and love me. I need his kiss and his voice and his soul conjoined with mine. Past that I know no need.  Everything happens for a reason. Matt's gone, to where we really don't know, but I'll tell you one thing. He'll be back. We're never gone for very long. Maybe I'll meet him again someday. Who knows. Till then I have my true love, for what else could I possibly ask?

      Current Mood: depressed Current Music: "Beautiful Man," Zakiyah  Today was just an awful day. Started out crappy because I didn't get to talk to Nathan, and I was reading about this stupid Christian guy that thinks everyone should be brainwashed into believing the same shit he believes, and so I was already in a pissy mood. Then I had to put up with my grandmother who was acting really weird and kept touching her legs...I dunno what's up with that. Then I went bowling with my family, that was fun, but I suck at bowling and so it pisses me off.   Then the most awful thing happened. We went by the Y to pick up some stuff and Clarence was there. Well somehow he always knows everything about everybody and he asked me if I knew a Nichols boy that graduated the year I did. I said, "Yeah, Matt, what about him?" Clarence responded, "He died early this morning. He wrecked his truck and it exploded as he walked away from it."  I felt like I had been hit in the torso with a sack full of bricks. I thought I was going to vomit, pass out, and fall to my knees weeping all at the same time. I couldn't speak, I couldn't move. I finally got in the car and came home. I was able to contain my sobbing, though not my tears, until I was safe in my room. Then I sat down at the computer and immediately started sobbing violently and uncontrollably. I was crying so hard I thought I was going to make myself sick. I spoke to Nathan and Nick was standing there, so he was not himself. I was so hoping he would make me feel better, but he didn't. Then Mother started yelling and banging on my door for me to give her the computer so that she could do some stuff for school, and I was mad at here, and crying and upset, and Nathan was being weird, and I know what I said and did was uncalled for and hateful and mean and inconsiderate, and I am so sorry for it...but I just couldn't handle all of it at once, I just didn't think or feel anymore, I just went numb and wanted to scream. It was horrible.   Now I am nothing but sad, because Nathan hasn't spoken to me since and I fear that he is so very angry with me. I don't know what to do except apologize, and I have the only way I know how. I hope he is not so furious with me that he will not speak to me...I don't know what I would do.   As for Matt, he was a great guy. Granted a bit perverted and immature sometimes, but who among us wasn't in those days? He partied a little too hard, and they think that's what happened. He really was a great guy though and did not deserve this at all. Sterling told me where it happened, and I think I will take some flowers by there when I get off work in the morning.   For now I am going to sit in my bed and pretend to be asleep or something so that Mother will leave me be, and hope that Nathan will talk to me when he gets done. I miss him so badly, and now I fear that I won't get to talk to him for a long time, much less see him any time soon...Oh, how I miss him...

      Current Mood: Contemplative Current Music: "Inner Peace," Steven Halpern  You know, I was browsing some journals, and then I looked at my own, and I realized that I have never really put my beliefs up front for people. Be aware I use the term "beliefs" loosely because I don't have a whole lot of conviction in what I "believe", it's just what I accept as truth at the moment.   My Mom has always been what some might call "out there" with her beliefs. She calls herself Christian, but really the term "Pagan" fits her much more appropriately. My Dad, I have come to understand, knows a great deal about many different religions, and he pretty much just calls himself Christian and doesn't give the matter much thought. My Grandmother those close to me know as Nanny was always a devout Methodist, so I had a lot of different influences at home.   Now...let's take a trip back to Franklin County High School, Tech B, in big room with a high ceiling, all white, and Ms. Baker, my biology teacher, giving us a free day to do as we please. I sit at a desk, one of those fancy ones with the stone top and the nice ergonomics, and Kristal Smith faces me. Before us on our conjoined desks lies a deck of cards...she turns them up in sequence and tells me what they mean. It was amazingly accurate. Kristal was my first run-in with a Pagan, though she disliked labels of any kind. Growing up as I did in a small Protestant Southern town, this was quite intriguing. I didn't really believe anything at that time. I wanted to be Christian, I felt like I was missing out on something by not being able to believe that. Kristal showed me a world of beliefs that had nothing to do with God, that seemed much closer to right to me. She introduced me to concepts for which I had long known the terms but not the creeds. I struggled for a few more years to figure out just what I believed, and by the time I got to college I had just adopted the title "Atheist" and that was good enough for me.   First day of GST rolls around (You know where this is going, love). There's this guy, and I spotted him as soon as I walked in...sat two seats behind him hoping for a chance to say Hi. I would've sat directly behind him but there was this other chick there that I initially didn't like for that reason, but I learned that she was not to be concerned about, it was this Grace girl that I was competing with...or pretending to compete, anyway...But that is of little consequence. We went around the room introducing ourselves, first thing I hear out of his mouth, "I'm Wiccan." I'm pretty sure my jaw hit the floor, I'm surprised people didn't stare. I had known of Wicca for some time from both my Mother and Kristal, and I immediately said, "That's awesome, dude." I was so glad to meet someone that was *not* Baptist or Methodist, or some form of undefined nominal Christian. Not to mention a particular system of beliefs with which I myself had long felt a connection. Of course, he didn't hear me, and we went on with our lives. Got to know this guy a little better and now I could not be more in love with someone. (Luckily he's in love with me, too!)  So I have spent the past six months learning from him more about the concepts to which Kristal introduced me. I found that I agree with him about a great deal, but there are areas where we differ as well. Also learned that he's more a Witch than a Wiccan, and that's even better. Kristal, way back then, sparked my interest in Astrology, which I abandoned in favor of school, friends, and more school. Well after I got sick, I rekindled that passion, and came to understand a great deal more about the subject. It has found a large place in my grand schema.   It is very hard to explain just what I believe. It's more of a concept, a picture in my mind, than something that can be explained in words. Essentially, astrology is more often than not correct because of the relationship of the planets at the time you are born. You can only be born during a certain formation of the planets, and also the stars though we don't quite understand those just yet. This seems a bit odd, yes? Well, it is I guess. See, Nathan and I had a conversation, more like he had a rambling one night, about the various planes of the universe, and how some are material like this one, and some are astral, and some are some of both (which would rock!). However, I believe that there are energies, perhaps sentient, I have not yet decided (I am leaning toward not), but not omnipotent or all-knowing beings such as the Christian God. Just simple energies, essences of something, that are embodied in this plane as planets and stars. I also have extended this to explain faeries. They are simply similar entities, but perhaps only existing in this plane. I am not so sure about that, I could go either way. That's just a thought I've had.   So you are reincarnated during a certain formation of stars and planets. You are not always reincarnated here, of course. You could go to other planets, other planes, or right back to the same spot. I think that often we are reincarnated into similar planes or similar planets because our souls grow accustomed to being in this type of form. This would also explain the commonheld belief that aliens look a lot like us, but that's just another thought too that has no bearing on reality whatsoever. Since there must be the right formation for you to come back each time, you are reincarnated with the same people. Such as Nathan, myself, and Nicholas. I firmly believe, and Nathan agrees, that the three of us have been together in many lives before this. He also says that he has been with all three of his close friends before, though perhaps not as many times as Nick and myself. This explains how people could be "meant to be", to me, as well. For instance, Nick and Nathan's souls were meant to be reincarnated together because their formations are similar. Same for him and me. Besides the fact that we know we have been lovers and friends before, our formations occur in the right proximity to one another for us to be together.  Like I said, this is all tentative. I learn something new all the time that leads me to believe something different, form a new theory or change my existing one. Nathan has been a great source of inspiration for this, and helped me by giving me the resources I need to learn more (Thank you so much!). There's so much more I could say, but I doubt what I have said makes sense to many people. And anyway, this post was fucking ginormous, so I'll stop now. LOL.

      Current Mood: Reflective Current Music: "Boston and St. John's," Great Big Sea  It did indeed rock!! This weekend was one of the best in my life!!  Started off a bit rocky...we had good music (in my opinion, though Nathan didn't like it all. He didn't much care if I would sing. *sigh*), but it took us 6 hours to get from my house to Thornsburg. Should've taken 4, but Mapquest led us astray. Or rather, it was not explicit enough. LOL. We eventually settled for the interstate way as my Father, in his infinite wisdom, had suggested. Twas 2300 and no one was around, I was creeped out and just wanted to go to bed, seeing as how I had worked and packed all day from 0500 the previous morn...  So finally we arrived at the hotel, or motel, or whatever. Didn't matter to me. There was a bed, a big one, and a shower, and that was all that mattered. The drive had been fun, since I love road trips and listening to music, and being with Nathan anywhere any time. But I was glad to be able to crash. Sarah, bless her, bought us a bottle of pink champagne, but I forgot the candles and Nathan forgot the stereo. We made our own music and our own love and we fell asleep together, exhausted, at about 0200. About 0930-1000, we woke, repeated the process, and then commenced to get ready for the Faire! McDonald's was kind to us on this trip and we drove about a half an hour away from I-95 to the Faire, which took place on the grounds of a winery. I had never been to a winery before, and it was intriguing. I've never seen so many grapes in my life! LOL.   So we walked around, partook of food and beverage, and basically immersed ourselves in Renaissance Britain. Nathan purchased a shirt that, once donned, tortured my lust for the remainder of the day. It was black (which flatters him to no end), with those poofy prince sleeves and a lace-up front that left just the right amount to the imagination. He has that new pentacle too, which I thought was cool, but for some reason with that shirt was so incredibly sexy...  I wore my blue dress, and everyone there hit on me...I dunno why, I think they were thrown off by the Celtic spirals and my freshly red hair (which I will say is an awesome color, and the token leather worker at the faire thought it was natural - I did not correct him...). Nathan just laughed it off because he knows how much I love him and that no one even makes me think twice. Nathan also wore his handguard that I bought him last weekend at the same faire in Salem, and got Alrick, whom I will discuss momentarily, to adjust it to fit him. So all in all, the boy looked bad ass and so very hot...  Anyway, Alrick. He's the man, or the blacksmith, whatever. He makes chain mail armor custom fit, and also just generic armor for whomever might want to purchase it. The first time I went to this Faire with my Mother (which was no fun because she complained and kept wanting to go...), I saw the handguard I wanted to get Nathan when we first came in. I decided to look around and see if I saw something I liked better, but I did not. By the end of the journey, we found ourselves back at Alrick's tent, and without cash. However, I thought to myself "Everyone else is taking 'Lady Visa' and 'Master Card", so he probably will too." Alas, twas not to be. He accepted only cash or 'cheque'. And so I was without a method of payment. He turned out to be a genuinely good human being, and said that when he looked into my eyes he could see I was trustworthy. He told me to give him what cash I had ($7) and mail him a check for the rest when I got home. I was stricken with his kindness and immediate trust in me (which did not hurt my ego on that day!), and so I smiled, agreed, and took a picture with him! I mailed the check the next day. We saw him yesterday and he said he got my check, and we talked for a while. I just love him! We talked to him at several points during the day, bought a bracelet from him and said goodbye before we left. I took this picture of him the first Faire I attended with me Mother.     That was one of many highlights of the weekend, another was this golden dress that I now possess. It’s one of those huge Arwen deals with the elbow holes with sleeves that drag the ground and a sort of mini train in the back. I really adore it. It’s so beautiful, even on someone as hideous as me. It was really weird, I tried it on and it was like he had made it especially to fit me. And now tis mine and I love it. We took this picture when we got back home (sort of takes the place of my non-existent prom pictures...)     So I changed into capris at a gas station and we got back on the interstate and drove for about 5 hours, give or take. We rolled the windows down at sunset, blaring Indie Rock, holding hands, my hair flying about my head, and the sunset behind his angelic face was the most beautiful sight through my purple sunglasses. We got home and pretty much collapsed in my bed, which I did not mind because any time I am in his arms I am happy. We took advantage of our last night together, and I woke with my head on his chest and his arms wrapped around me…Nothing was more wonderful…  He’s gone now…but we both have webcams and it’s like a video phone sort of deal, which is nice but no substitute for the real thing. My heart is always with him though, and that will never change. I like to think I have his too. There really isn’t that much ocean…just a little bit of blacktop…

      Current Mood: Excited Current Music: "Renaissance Faire," Blackmore's Night  Tis finally Friday! The day for which you have all been waiting! Or at least I have. I must away to work here shortly, but after I get off (an hour early!) I will be with my one true love. That's right, you all know him as the most incredible human being ever made: Nathan!  No, no, I'm not excited. Ha! I have not been more excited since our first kiss! Okay, maybe I have...like every time I see him or think about him or hear his name. *sigh* He is fantastic...I love him so much...  Anyway, here's the plan. We're driving up to a hotel tonight, it's about a four hour drive *yuck* and Nathan will make me drive the whole way. Just my luck I'll get a ticket, but no matter. So we'll hang out there all night, little champagne little candlelight little soft music. Twill rock, I say! And then we shall sleep in each others arms like the days of old...  When we wake Saturday I will don my Celtic steel blue dress (although it's supposed to be 90 degrees, I may suffocate and have a heat stroke, especially with my blood pressure where it has been) and my platform sandals (that sounds fucked up but they really look good together) and we shall make our way to Renaissance Britain, conveniently located by the Loch!  Then, the fun in public must come to a close, and then we shall return to the hotel and hang out for a while, and then find ourselves back here in my home (hell pit that it is). Again we shall sleep wrapped in each other's embrace.   Alas! Early Sunday he must vacate the premises, for tis Mother's Day. And then who knows when I will see him again. Not the following weekend...he has...engagements...and I am going to see if the weekend after that cannot be spent in the company of our (and yes I said our!) fine friends in Hickville, where they find themselves very out of place.   I will not think about Sunday, nor will I think about next weekend. I will think merely of his presence in my arms, the taste of his kiss, the warmth and love in his soul...  Twill rock, I do indeed say!!

      Current Mood: Nostalgic Current Music: "If You're Gone," Matchbox 20   I dunno why I did this...but it felt right, and it still feels like I did the right thing.   A while back this friend and I had this falling out. I liked (more like was madly in love...maybe as much as I love Nathan, though I doubt it...) this guy for 3 years...and when I finally talked to him about it he told me that I, quite frankly, wasn't good enough. Maybe I wasn't then. I'm probably not now. But despite that, we were best friends, and we had some crazy, fun times. Our personalities made for a great friendship, though looking back would've made a very...explosive...relationship...  So today, I left him a note under his windshield wiper...he saw me there before I did it, so he knows what to expect when he comes out to go home from work...lol. It may have been a long time, but he still knows my basics better than almost anyone (except Nathan of course). Especially my affinity for notes. I dunno...I'd thought about doing that a couple times before, but I chickened out. This time I didn't hesitate. It said simply, "Hey, it's me, but you knew that. I was sitting here thinking about old times, and I thought that maybe life had made us both better people. Maybe we can give our friendship another shot. Call my cell (my #) if you want to catch up or reminisce. Your long lost friend, Tara"   Not too bad, eh? He knows about Nathan, because I have paraded him around Jason's workplace many a time out of spite, hoping to induce some level of jealousy.That was petty and short-sighted. And Roxie mentioned him today and I told her all about our weekend excursion we have planned, so I know they talk about him and me. I dunno...I feel like I could've handled things better back then and done right by him. Something about this feels unfinished, and I'm going to try and either finish it, or continue it.   I'd really like to be friends with him again. We had a killer friendship. We knew and understood each other better than anyone else. I think that's why I fell for him. No danger of that this time. Nathan has my heart, all of it. And I don't see that changing. LOL. Plus I have a better perspective on relationships. Jason and I were much too alike to ever work. He was like a male, granted more cocky, version of myself. It was hard losing him as a friend, not to mention being rejected by him. I dunno...I guess that wound has never totally healed...

      Current Mood: Sick and Mystical... Current Music: "Memory," Betty Buckley  I had the most unusual dream. But it did not feel like a dream.   It felt like a memory.   I was in the back of a wagon, a very large animal-propelled wagon, walled with wooden planks, looking out over the side at the scenery, and out the back at the cloud of dirt that rose up behind the wagon. It felt like Italy somehow, though I have never been there and cannot say for sure that's where I was. Trees were along the roadside in places, olives I believe, though I can't be sure, and we passed a winery. In the background were mountains higher than those I have ever seen in my lifetime, but not so high as to have snowcaps. I was not alone in the wagon. A woman was with me. I called her April, though that was not her name. What it was I cannot say, but that was the nickname I had for her for some unknown reason. The strangest thing was the feel of her. She felt like Nathan. Our relationship and interaction just had the feel of Nathan and me. I loved her with all my heart. We talked, about what I don't remember, and kissed and I held her as we rode down the dirt road.    Let your memory lead you Open up, enter in If you find there the meaning of what happiness is Then a new life will begin   It's mostly the feeling of the dream I remember. One of complete happiness and love. We were both very dirty and hot and sweaty, and a scent was in the air like nothing I have ever encountered. One of heat and sea and dirt. A pleasant rural smell, but nothing I can recapture. I can almost remember the way the dry wood felt against my rough palm, and the soft smoothness of her tan skin. Nothing dramatic happened in the dream. We just rode on in the wagon, empty other than the dry dirt lining it, and of course our sticky bodies. Things seemed older, more alive, greener and brighter and more simply wonderful. Of course it could've been her.   And no, I was not gay in this dream...   Touch me‚ it's so easy to leave me. All alone with the memory of my days in the sun If you touch me‚ you'll understand what happiness is Look a new day has begun.

      Current Mood: Lonely already... Current Music: "Unchained Melody," Sarah McLachlan  I had a decent weekend overall, though I think had Nathan not been there it would've sucked outright. Friday he called me from 81, announcing that he was on his way, which was a most welcome surprise after the week I had endured. He arrived, as beautiful as ever, with a hello kiss and a gorgeous smile. That smile only I see, only I understand and appreciate and reciprocate. Friday was spent enjoying one another's company, various activities, and a much missed embrace once we were alone for the night. Saturday we woke up and went to Philpott Lake to fish with my Father and brother. Nathan is not much of a fisherman by choice, and did not much enjoy that aspect of the morning, but I think he enjoyed sitting by the Lake talking with Sam and myself. Daddy caught a bluegill, other than that twould seem the Lake was empty that day, though we didn't fish very dedicatedly. We went home and laid around together for a while, and about 8:00 an old friend called and asked if we would like to come over to his apartment. I was mildly excited at the opportunity, as I had not seen his new place or his new dog, and I had not spent time with him in a friendship capacity for some time either. Nathan was not so excited. As a matter of fact he went only begrudgingly. But he does not realize what a good thing it was that we went.    And Time goes by so slowly and Time can do so much...   I stood before this man, with whom I once thought I could be very happy, in his house with his fiance and mine. I had not had time to properly reflect on him during other encounters, as I had other things on my mind, but here in this place, away from all distraction other than an underlying lust that I always feel when in Nathan's presence, I could really analyze exactly what I was feeling. I know I once felt something very strong for him; at the time I thought it was love, but now I know that it was not. I have love now, with Nathan, and I knew that from the first day I spent with this man in recent weeks what I felt for him was not love. He is a dear friend, nothing more. I saw before me my past, when I was a different person. I was weaker, younger, more naive, and more longing. Beside me was my present and my future, Nathan, my life and my love. I saw in those few hours what I knew in my heart before we went. I saw the weakness of the bonds I have with him, and I saw the strength of the love I have for Nathan. If for no other reason than his accompanying me despite his knowledge of my past feelings, I was reassured of his love for me as well.   Sunday was spent in procrastination, with Nathan putting off going home as long as he possibly could. His Mother is such a psychotic bitch...Anyway, he's gone now and I haven't heard from him for a few hours. I miss him so much already...  One good note - I just finished the first tomato sandwich of the season, and I just did my hair again. Don't I feel special.   Godspeed our love, Godspeed your love to me...

      Current Mood:Exhausted and Disconcerted Current Music: "Auld Lang Syne," Great Big Sea  First week of Summer Camp is over, thank the heavens. It wasn't too bad. I know everyone's name, including the twins Sarah and Kate (whom I realized today I could tell apart so easily because of their auras; Kate's is bluish and Sarah's is redish). I have a good group of kids, overall. One little boy Jacob is a bit tempermental, and by that I mean he screams in my face every chance he gets, despite repeated trips to the "Principal's" office (Russ on an ego trip...). Halen has trouble keeping his hands to himself, every five minutes he's hit/kicked/pushed/bit/pissed on someone and I have to scold him even though I know it does no good. I'll get Sarah to kick him out if he doesn't straighten up next week. It's been fun trying to teach the kids the character values when they will barely sit still for ten minutes at a time. *sigh*...  Nathan was supposed to be here by now, but that bitch of a mother he has demanded he stay later. I fucking hate her. *sigh* Not a whole lot I can do about it, I suppose. Tiniest bit of whiplash has set in today, just hurts when I look to my left. I left lovely marks on both sides of the road and the pavement itself. Hehe. Go me! I am exhausted after a 40-hour work week and so I am going to take a nap. If I get a chance this weekend I'll check-in, if not I'll be back to Blogging on Monday. Toodles!

      Current Mood: downtrodden but lucky Current Music: When Irish Eyes Are Smiling  Left for work this morning, right, Hey Ya! is playing on the radio. I reach to my left because my mirror is not where it should be, and my hand apparently pulls the wheel to the right, sending my car into the gravels on the side of the road. I, in my infinite wisdom, do what everyone does by instinct, and jerk the car back to the left. Whee, here we go, on a merry go round of danger, and where we stop nobody knows! Oh, wait, I know, after slamming into the hillside and bouncing into the air and back into the middle of the road in a dizzying spin, I came to a stop on the opposite side of the road, almost down the side of the hill.   Alas, for all you who hate me, I am uninjured and ticketless. I cannot say so much for the car, as the front axle is broken in half (not the first time I've done that to a car), but I am not in trouble. I am out of work until 1400 because of it. Losing money but gaining mental stability before I step back into my room of 30 screaming second graders. So yeah, I'm fine, the adrenaline is fading and I have little to no whiplash.  Gotta love that Irish luck...

      Current Mood: Exhausted and Lonely Current Music: "Kiss Me," Sixpence None the Richer  It's a gorgeous night...   Kiss me...   Oh how I wish you could.   Well, the reunion sucked because I hate Nathan's family, but I was with him and Tucker, so I made do. He laid his head in my lap under the oak tree on the hill as I played with his hair, which I fixed to look quite good, if I do say so myself. I wore this hideous brightly colored Spring dress that my grandmother gave me. I only wore it because Nathan was freaking about me being conservative. *sigh* I changed into something more fitting to my personality, as well as more comfortable, before we visited Satan herself, aka Billy Henley.    We'll take the trail marked on your Father's map...   The weekend was wonderful if for nothing other than the grand time we had at the Park, which I discussed earlier, if for no other reason than the way Nathan felt exactly what I did the whole day. He wrote a  urlLink post  about it if anyone wants to read it.  He finally wrote a  urlLink post  concluding the "dilemma" as he is so fond of calling it, that we found ourselves in a while back. I was pleased with his decision, needless to say, but the whole situation was just plain unpleasant...It's best for all involved that it is over, and in the long run we will all be happy.   Summer Camp has started, and it rocks. Lots of my kids have moved up and out of my group, but it's okay, I still get to see them. Luckily next year I will have Dakota, and he's the man! ;)  I am so sleep-deprived...Camp is wearing me out...*passes out*

      Current Mood: Contented and Elated Current Music: "Turn Me On," Norah Jones   It's been incredible so far, as it usually is. I live for the weekends, and soon I will live for the weeks (beginning tomorrow actually) when Summer Camp starts. Right now Nathan is showering and soon we will away to his Mother's family reunion. Something tells me they will not like me nearly as well as his Father's did. I hope we get time to see his Dad before we leave today as he is in a bad place right now and supposedly seeing me would make him feel better. Apparently he told Nathan "Hold on to Tara, she's a keeper." Aww...I love that man.   Friday when no one was around and we were free to roam the county we went up to Waid Park and traversed the unknown. I finally was able to find the trail that leads out onto the waterfall, with no small effort and a bit of rock climbing. Nathan had fun and so did I. I let the river wash away my cares, and I sat with him on the rocks, talking and holding him and loving him completely. That place is simply gorgeous, even more so when you are a part of it.   Saturday we spent a great deal of time with my grandparents. More than I usually care for, but it was okay. I drove Nathan around on the ATV. He was afraid for his life and I laughed at him.  If you're not living on the edge you're taking up too much space.  Then we had a semi-philosophical conversation with my grandmother. That was interesting. It had been a while since I had done that. It was her birthday, but we had to leave and go to Brittany's graduation party. We didn't stay very long, but her friends seemed cool and I felt like I should at least show my face since I promised to go. Nathan seemed a bit more than discontent with the whole thing, but then he doesn't much go for the party scene.   Last night we hiked our way up the mountain to Nick's house, to be greeted by the Hounds of Hell, who are suprisingly very sweet animals. (How fitting for Nick ;D) He did lots of nice stuff for me, we hung out and then made our way back down. As we speak we are preparing to go this crazy family function at which I am sure I will have very little fun. The only redeeming feature is Nathan's presence...

      Current Mood: excited and anxious Current Music: "My Sacrifice," Creed  It's been a while where should we begin?  I apologize for not posting sooner, but my computer went totally loco and decided it didn't have an IP address, nor did it have a network card. Right now I am on my brother's laptop, which  barely runs as the case is falling apart and it has trouble with its C drive. Good news is that I got my hub hooked up so the house will be wired and Mother and Sam won't steal my connection at every available turn. LOL.   So...what has happened that I haven't written? Not much really. My life is relatively unexciting when Nathan isn't around. B&A is over. So I have the next few days off until Summer Camp starts on Monday. I am so very excited about that! I cannot wait to see all my kids again. I learned long ago that if I make it fun for the kids, they will reciprocate, so I have a blast. This year I have two great girls working for me. Jessie Clatts (with whom I graduated) and Shannon...I cannot remember her last name...but anyway, I know Jessie relatively well, she'll be with me in the mornings, and on field trips, and Shannon, whom I had not met before the training yesterday but seems nice enough...bit too quiet and reserved for this job, methinks...in the afternoons. I am in charge of my group this year, working full time. So not only will I enjoy the authority, but I will enjoy the money as well. I think I will save it and try to take Nathan to the beach before school starts, or just keep it and wait until Fall Break, when we can probably get cheaper rates and less crowds. I doubt his Aunt Sharon will invite me back this summer, since this winter she got this stupid idea in her head that we did something inappropriate in her living room on a mattress with Tucker 5 feet from us. That's just bullshit is all it is. *sigh* Whatever. I don't much like her. She's so fucking fake. I *hate* fake people...  Last night Seth and Scott just sort of showed up at my house. I don't really mind. They are welcome here as I am welcome at their house. We took Mother's car (*drools*) and went to the store, then went to their house to watch Larry the Cable Guy on DVD. Really I enjoyed their company more than Larry. It was cool hanging out with them. I was supposed to go to lunch with them today, but I couldn't because I have to clean the house if Nathan is to come over tonight.   Ah yes, and Nathan is coming over tonight if anyone cares. LOL. I certainly care, I love him more than life itself, and cannot wait to see him and hold him. I cannot wait until Fall when we'll be together every day and every night.    When you are with me I'm free. I'm careless, I believe. Above all the others We'll fly. This brings tears to my eyes.   Soon, milove, you won't have to miss me...

      Current Mood: Meh Current Music: "The Beat Goes On," Britney Spears (don't judge me!)   "Drums keep pounding a rhythm to the brain."   Well, he's gone...left me about 0600 this morning when I went to work. I watched him drive away and couldn't cry in front of Nancy no matter how badly I wanted to.    "Love is a thirsting, lasting on my mind  From tomorrow until the end of time."   Well, any of you who are wondering what did happen last night, it was...eh...incredible. We went to bed a bit early as we had to get up and part First off, Nathan gave me a really incredible full body massage, as he is prone to do having learned the art from his grandfather (who did it professionally for years). Twas much needed as Summer Camp is about to start and my life is about to get much more stressful. After that I did what he had so much enjoyed before, obviously as differently as possible without straying from the basic principle.   I have always been able to see certain people's auras. Like an old friend of mine had a very distinct pink aura, and my brother's is yellow. I cannot see everyone's, I'm pretty sure it's just those people who have a particularly strong one. However, I have never been able to see chakras before. I know where they are, roughly, and what they do, but I had never actually seen them and their energy before. Last night I did. But it's not so much vision...it's not something I can *see* with my eyes...it's very hard to explain. I know it's there and I can identify a color and shape, but it is not with optical vision. Tis very strange. I'm sure the Venus-Mars parallel didn't hurt any last night, and since the Moon was approaching that lovely monthly union with Neptune, paranormal psychological activity has been heightened. Twas a great night for it. But anyway, I could "see" Nathan's chakras and the energy they release. It is spirtual energy manifesting itself in the physical body. Because I could see it, I could manipulate it, whereas before I was only doing this by feel and trial and error. I moved it around as I pleased and learned how it worked. It was really fascinating and very intriguing. Nathan unintentionally found some of my energy when he was massaging me, though I don't know if he realized it. And anyway, he seemed to enjoy it, and I enjoyed it a great deal, all four ways one can enjoy something.   Giving is always better than receiving.  So yes, the beat of my life has returned to normal again, but it will be interrupted as I am off Wed-Sun. Well, I have a training for a few hours on Wednesday, but that doesn't count. No more B&A. I have to say I will miss a lot of my kids. Nicky especially...I may have to visit Boones Mill on occasion to see him. I will see a lot of my old kids at Camp though, so it will be okay. I'll probably cry tomorrow. The kids spent all day today asking me about Camp and about B&A next year and telling me "You're the coolest counselor ever!" and "I love you, Miss Tara"...I will miss the little stinkers. Even Garrett Lefue...though not Garrett Sturgill...nuh uh...not one bit...   La-dee-da-dee-dee La-dee-da-dee-da...

      It's Sunday night, hopefully Nathan will get to stay again tonight, he's obtaining permission from his Mother right now, though he is 19...biatch. Anyway, the weekend, though nothing overly spectacular has happened (except what I will get to in a moment) has been one of the greatest ever. Friday he got here kind of late, we hung out and watched Donnie Darko (kicked fucking ass!) Saturday we got up and made good use of our time, driving to Waid Park, taking lots of pictures of cool old run down houses and barns and of course my beloved waterfall. We also took pictures of one another in my favorite tree down there. His turned out just wonderful...     My goodness he is gorgeous...The one of me was, well, of me, and so sucked ass, but I'll put it up here anyway because Nathan likes it (he took it...so I guess he should).     So after that we went to develop the pictures (which are on CD and that's how you can see them). We laid around the house together, I was trapped in his gaze and his arms, and I loved it. After that we watched a few movies.  After that something amazing happened. I thought I knew him before. Never in my life have I known someone's body and soul so well as I have come to know his. "The most incredible, mind-bending pleasure I've ever experienced in my life," he says Hmm...Yeah, he said that, but I think I enjoyed it even more than he did. No receiving can come close to the joy and pleasure I get from giving what little I can to him. I spent a good three hours doing the little things I know turn him on, and discovering a few new ones by trial and error. I waited patiently as Cleopatra (the really good one with Billy Zane) went off, and then made him close his eyes and keep his hands under him. I learned much of him that I did not know...knowledge that I cherish more than any I can learn in school. He is so beautiful, in and out. Each time he moved or gasped or moaned, or after when he didn't move or complete a sentence, I thought I would weep. The feel of him, the taste of him...he is so unbelievably perfect, "mind-bending pleasure" is not nearly enough to repay him for all the happiness that he has given me, and continues to fill me with every moment of my life.   Who knows what will happen tonight... ;P  P.S. - I have new pictures on my post about the  urlLink Renaissance Faire.

      Current Mood: Quirky Current Music: Summer Nights  I find myself finding things to like about Summer. I really hate it, but mostly just because of the heat (not to mention not seeing Nathan...*weeps*). But I love the way the sky looks so much larger. I think it's that the clouds are higher and more dynamic in colors and shading. The horizon seems like it goes on forever, instead of just 3/4 of the way to forever.   Only two things go on forever: Rainbows, and true love. I have seen many Rainbows, but only seen true love twice. That which my Father has for my Mother (not vice versa) and that which Nathan and I have for one another.   He went to a gas station with Courtney so she could wish him a Happy Birthday...intriguing...  Only difference in that song and my life is that I do most of my loving during the year...  But Oh Those Suuuummmmmer Niiii-iiights  Anyone looked at the Moon tonight?? Holy Fuck! It's gorgeous and massive! Like an orgasm of all four persuasions...*passes out*

      Well this weekend was fun. Friday and Saturday night were wonderful, locked away in his room with him, doing as we pleased and falling asleep in each other's embrace. Saturday we went to his Father's family reunion. His Dad and I get along well, so that was fun. Then Saturday night Nicholas came over, and that rocked as usual. I love that boy more every time I talk to him (in a platonic way of course ;D). Then Sunday we took our time about getting out of bed, but we woke up fairly early. Took our time about getting out of town too, we stopped in Java J's and had Gelato, drove around for a while, then finally left Abingdon about 1600 or so. There's this great park in Graham's Forge at which we have stopped before, and so we went with my camera and took tons of pictures of it. It's a gorgeous place. I'll try to get the pictures up here when they are developed. We did obscene things to freak out the old people walking their dogs and it was so much fun, and so magical being in a place like that with him. Or, more accurately, magickal. Lots of other stuff has been going on with him almost having a full-time job and going to school again. I miss him so much. He's only been gone about 24 hours and already my heart yearns for him. He isn't here to welcome me home online tonight, and he won't be for the next few weeks. *tear* Summer Camp begins in less than two weeks. *dances happy dance*  I feel obligated to post my results to those quizzes, love, but unlike yourself I shall consolidate into one post :-D    Nerdslut    urlLink   What's your sexual appeal?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    That one wasn't surprising.

      Google, that you may only know as a search engine, is a massive corporation that is gradually monopolizing the internet (doesn't sound possible? Google makes it possible!). This sounds bad, yes? Let me tell you, brother, it is a wonderful thing.   I hope this is my last move...  Only thing I don't like about Blogger is I had gotten used to the Mood and Song thingies on LJ, which I really liked. So I'm thinking I'll just try to remember to add them in myself in each post :-D.

      Current Mood: Slightly confused, otherwise Happy Current Music: "Dream Weaver," REO Speedwagon  Nathan is here, Huzah! All is well in my life for the next few days, but this weak will be fine because next weekend is Celtic Weekend and no one will be around to bother us. But the reason for my post is to record the two dreams I had last night. The first was probably less important, but still warrants recording as I actually remembered it.   The first time I went to sleep I had a very strange dream that I think was caused by the illness that is upon me. (Chest and head congestion, nothing serious.) We lived at the house on 122 again, and it was just as it should be. Usually when I dream about houses, they are not quite normal, but this was all correct, right down to the driveway and the horse pasture and the fence. I kept having these nickel-sized clots of blood and hair, shaped almost like the pit of a peach, come out of my ears. It was not painful, just strange, and I remembered in the dream having dreamed before that this would happen to me, so I was not surprised when it happened. My grandpa came and brought tires in his truck, and my father and I had to maneuver the truck while my grandpa steered because the motor wouldn't run. Nathan and I were in the house after that, and he was taking care of me because I was ill and couldn't hear very well. We both ate apples one after another in the living room, and then I woke up.   Nathan and I woke up for about an hour, and then fell asleep again, during which time I had another dream. This was a peculiar dream, but I believe it was important. We were on a field trip with all the kids, and we had taken them to this cove thing on the ocean to swim. There were mountains that formed a sort of lake, which then waterfalled into the ocean. The kids stayed in the lake and were not to go near the waterfall. There was also a large building built into the mountain. Inside, the building was all white and seafoam and light blue, with the exception of the lockers which were tan. I wandered around the building for a while  because for some reason I didn't have to stay with the kids, and I found Owen sitting at the top of a flight of stairs staring off into space. We talked for a while, but he was very cryptic and hard to understand. Eventually I went about my business, and a lady that worked there tried to stop me from putting something in a locker. I told her I was 17 and would be 18 in 2 months, so if she had a problem with me then she should take it up with my Mother, who poked her head around the corner and looked sternly at the woman. So I put my clothes and towel on top of the locker, and wearing only my bathing suit, began wondering around again. We had to corral the children from the snack bar into the lake to swim some more before time to leave, so Tristan was eating his french fries very slowly. I took them and shoved them in his mouth and ran him out of the room. There was a large balcony off of the snack bar where Sarah was standing and so I stood with her and looked down on the children. Owen was swimming with the children, but he looked very normal (though in the dream this was not strange.) I noticed while I was up there that there was a large slide coming out of the mountain. I asked Sarah about it and she informed me it snaked through the rooms in the building, and I had to find the end of it. So I set out in search of it, only to come across Owen again in a different spot. I stopped on my way into the room, before he could see me, and red these red letters on the side of a white rolling cart, on which a TV was sitting. They described concerns about a house (I don't remember what they said exactly, but it would've been something to the effect of leaky faucets, weak foundation, etc.). He was sitting near the slide entrance with belongings around him, some of which he was throwing into the slide. He looked very defeated. In the room in which he was sitting, everything had very sharp corners and multiple levels and there was a wall with a lot of pictures on it. He explained the words in the previous room to me, though he didn't know I had stopped to read them. I said, "You read my mind," with a chuckle, and he said, "I always do." He spoke in very cryptic language again, and I didn't understand him. He pointed over to the wall of pictures. When we looked more closely, there were riddles written on each of them. He read off pieces of each riddle, and as he did those pieces floated into the air in front of me, forming a separate riddle, but he didn't finish before my brother came into the room and woke me up. I couldn't get back to sleep to finish it. I think what he did get to read had something to do with a wreck and regret, and I think it was something personal to him. He kept holding his stomach the whole time, as if there were something wrong with it again. I think that riddle was very important, but I wasn't sleepy enough to get back into it. If I can keep these images in my mind, I might be able to get back in it tonight. I'll sleep with my quartz under my pillow.   Now, because I love this song, I will leave you with its lyrics.     Dream weaver I’ve just closed my eyes again Climbed aboard the dream weaver train Driver take away my worries of today And leave tomorrow behind Ooh dream weaver I believe you can get me through the night Ooh dream weaver I believe we can reach the morning light  Fly me high through the starry skies Maybe to an astral plane Cross the highways of fantasy Help me to forget today’s pain  Ooh dream weaver I believe you can get me through the night Ooh dream weaver I believe we can reach the morning light  Though the dawn may be coming soon There still may be some time Fly me away to the bright side of the moon And meet me on the other side  Ooh dream weaver I believe you can get me through the night Ooh dream weaver I believe we can reach the morning light Dream weaver Dream weaver Dream weaver

When she loved...me...   When somebody loved me,  Everything was beautiful  Every hour we spent together,  Lives within my heart   When she...loved...me...

      Current Mood: Melancholy, but Hopeful Current Music: "I Want To Live," Josh Gracin   The not fun part was coming home to my Father bitching and being reminded that Nathan is not with me. I miss him so much. All that momentary fun was just covering up my underlying misery at his distance from me. I've been reading, writing, anything to keep busy from thinking about where he is and what he's doing, and the fact that, whatever it is, it's not with me or near me...I am withering without him.   Worst of all, the more we are apart, it seems, the more we fight. Sometimes it's just a misunderstanding, or something we just snap at one another, but still sometimes they are genuine disagreements that split us apart on an issue. As if the physical distance from him were not bad enough, we are not one anymore. We are two people in a relationship. We are not two souls joined as one as we have been in the past. I don't know if that's just from not seeing each other and not talking as often, or if he is pulling away from me. Either way, I don't like it, and I hope Celtic Weekend finds everything back where it belongs. I love him so much, I cannot bear to lose him. My soul could not take another loss of that calibur, it barely withstood the last.   She's totally gone now. I really can't feel her anymore in my heart. It saddens me to think that she has abandoned me, but the fact is maybe I can do it on my own now. I don't have to be led about by the hand. For 6 years now, I have had to do it alone. I miss her guidance and her support, but I guess I can be my own Mother now. I have to be, in most cases. Sometimes it is better to not know what you are missing, to never know what you could have if not for stupid doctors and human failings.   I miss her, and I miss him, and I have nothing here worth celebrating. I have my Father, but increasingly this "my little girl" stuff is irritating more than endearing. I have to get away from this place, I have to get away from my family and my friends and my past. Run from it like it was the plague. Everything that has happened matters not, what will happen is what is important. I will tell you right now what it will be. I will go to school, spend every available moment with Nathan, and try not to think about my regrets, my shortcomings, and the people that know just how deep my fault lines run. I will learn, I will grow, and I will forget. I will love Nathan more than any human being should be able to or willing to. My life has not begun. With him, I have a chance to make someone happy, make myself happy, and I will try my best. I'll give him my heart and soul, my mind, and my body. I have nothing else to give, so I hope it's enough.   I love you, Nathan...        Sometimes I feel like I need to shake myself, to wake myself:  I feel like I'm just sleep walkin' through out life.  It's like I'm swimmin' in an ocean of emotion,  But still, somehow, slowly goin' numb inside.  I don't like who I'm becomin', I know I've gotta do somethin',  Before my life passes right by.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,  An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.  Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',  Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.  Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,  Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.  Take everything that this world has to give:  I wanna live.   Sometimes I wonder why I work so hard to guard my heart.  Well, I hardly feel anything at all.  I've spent my whole life buildin' up this ivory tower.  Now that I'm in it, I keep wishin' it would fall.  So I can feel the ground beneath me, really taste this air I'm breathin',  And know that I'm alive.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,  An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.  Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',  Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.  Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,  Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.  Take everything that this world has to give:  I wanna live,  I wanna live.   Somethin' deep inside keeps sayin life is like a vapor:  It's gone in just the twinklin' of an eye.   I want to cry like the rain, cry like the rain,  An' shine like the sun on a beautiful mornin'.  Sing to the heavens like a church bell ringin',  Fight with the devil an' go down swingin'.  Fly like a bird, roll like a stone,  Love like I ain't afraid to be alone.  Take everything that this world has to give.  I wanna take every breath I can get:  I wanna live

      Current Mood: Exhausted  Current Music: "Colors of&nbsp;the Wind,"&nbsp;Pocahontas...all too appropriate&nbsp;   I just got back from my grandparents, and boy did I have a blast! I wish Nathan had been there, though I doubt he would've enjoyed it as much as I did. There is a trail near my grandparent's house that my Grandfather calls "Root 66" because he thinks he's clever. (There are a lot of roots, dangerous ones, that protrude from the ground all along the trail.) So today we had to go down to the&nbsp;creek to get rocks for Summer Camp. They are going to make "pet" rocks in celebration of the Dixie Caverns trip on Thursday. (I am so nervous about losing a child on this trip I could shit myself, but I think I'll save that for if/when it actually happens.) Anyway, back to the fun. Mother had planned for me to ride on her ATV with her down to the river and back. However, my Grandfather, Light shine on him, decided 150 rocks would not fit in two buckets, which is all that can be safely bungied to one ATV. So we had to take two, requiring me to drive one. Not that I was upset about this, mind, but Mother was nervous about it. I took the red one, my personal favorite as it is a stick shift with amazing amounts of power, and it's the newest and nicest of the three they have (complete with only 72 miles on it).         &nbsp;   Mother took the yellow one, which is also a stick, but is more worn than the red one (422 miles, I believe).          So we set out about 1600, and got to the river shortly thereafter. It took us about 30 minutes to collect the appropriate amount of rocks that were the appropriate size. My feet are killing me, because I was wearing my Birks and didn't want to get them wet, so I waded about in the river barefoot. Something (probably a crawdad, which you more classy folks might know as a crayfish) pinched me, I stepped on a briar, and those rocks are really sharp in your bare feet! Having seen that I did fine on the ride down, kept up well and didn't wreck, Mother said, why don't we ride around on the trails for a while before we head back. So we did. I had heard tell of gigantic white rocks in the woods, which some degree of mystery surrounding them.   It took about 15-20 minutes to get to them, and the trails were full of deep mudholes. Mother avoided them as best she could, but not me. I ran right through them. Hehe. (Needless to say, my ATV needed to be washed before it was put away. LOL) The rocks are very cool. They are gigantic quartz chunks arranged very tightly together. My Mother and I concur that someone put them there, though it's obvious from their surroundings and the little pieces around them, that they have been there for some time. It was worth the ride, but the ride was more fun. ;)   It was so cool. Scooby, Blackie, Sissy, and Joey (some of my grandparents' many dogs) went along with us, and with Mother and I going about their same speed, it was like we were running with the pack. I felt so free, so alive, moreso than perhaps I ever have. Even if I was riding a massive machine, I felt more a part of the nature around me than I ever have. Blackie stayed by my side the whole time, as if we were bonding, and when we got back she stayed with me for the rest of the day, even tried to get in the car when I left. She's a beautiful dog, and so smart and sweet. She and Scooby and Bear really remind me of wolves in their behavior. Riding at their speed, seeing them run along with me through twisting mountain trails...I can't put it into words, but it's one of the most beautiful things that has ever happened to me.   DAMN THAT WAS FUN!!

      Current Mood: Intrigued  Current Music: "Bring Me Some Water," ME   &nbsp;   urlLink    A SILVER Dragon Lies Beneath!   &nbsp;     Your Inner Dragon is to dragons what the Ranger is to humans. Silvers are one of three types of metallic dragon, the others being Gold and Copper. Like all metallics, Silvers rigidly adhere to an internal code of conduct. Unlike the other two metallics, however, this code is not universal. Each Silver must develop their code individually, a fact which explains their unique dispositions and actions. Silvers are often considered outcasts or shadows dwelling on the periphery of dragon culture (much like human Rangers), but they can always be counted upon to speak the truth and help their allies. Because no one but a Silver knows what they'll do next, their alignment is "Chaotic Neutral."   Being a Silver isn't all shady head-games, though. You possess considerable intelligence and self-confidence (whether they manifest themselves or not), and given the opportunity could make a great leader. Magic isn't really your bag, but you're awfully good at slipping in and out of a situation or conflict undetected. Which, by the way, may be due to your slightly-below-average size more than anything else. Your favorable attributes are dependability, durability, problem-solving, mist, fog, silver, and pewter. Like your human counterpart - the Ranger - you're a superb weapons user and have an especially good command of your icy breath weapon. Just keep in mind that even your friends may find your ethics hard to accept from time to time.

      Current Mood: Bitter and Depressed  Current Music: "Iris," Goo Goo Dolls (My feel good song...and yes I know that makes me fucked up.)  &nbsp;  I am so tired of the past. The present would be great if it were not for that. I had a long talk with my Mother about Jason the other day. I didn't want to, but she forced the subject on me. Why must we have regret? What stupid human starting having that emotion and chemically passed it on to the rest of it? I'd like to kill the fucker. And what about anger? I'm so fucking mad right now I could just scream. But I won't. I won't even say why I am mad or with whom. Some people are just so damned disrespectful... Well, at least I can be confident I am a better person than some people, though they are few and far between. I even hate Nathan's past, and my Mother's past, and God knows I despise everything about my own outside the past 9 months.

      Current Mood: Worried and Bewildered  Current Music: "Beautiful Man," Zakiyah  &nbsp;  Yet again I have found that someone from my past has been in&nbsp;a horrible accident. Paul wrecked his car a few days ago. Last news I heard he was in critical condition. Why is it that we were all fine in high school (with the exception of Keith, but I don't really want to talk about him just now...)? We graduate and apparently develop this cockiness that gets us into trouble. He's so cute and such a nice boy too, I hope he's alright. If I was one for dieties, I'd&nbsp;say a prayer for him.  &nbsp;  I don't much like everyone I know being hurt or horrible things happening. I feel like I'm drifting back into Middle School, when I felt like the world was coming down around me and there was no way out. I feel like Mersault, cornered and surrounded by the sheer horror of the world and this life we lead, with no other way out but to accept its absurdity and take whatever comes next. Is my victory in my surrender to this life? Probably. Am I ready to give up and win just yet? No. No I am not.  &nbsp;  This is why I was atheist, chains of events like these. Times when I don't have a God to pray to or a friend to talk to. Of course, this time is different. I still have Nathan, and hopefully always will. That's the reason I'm not giving up just yet. But I'm adaptable, I can get used to anything. Satan would have a fine time torturing me, because I can eventually get used to whatever he can dish out. Bring it on, world. I can take it.  &nbsp;  Sure I can...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Current Mood: Groggy  Current Music: "Daydream Believer," The Monkees&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  I dreamed I was in a video game sort of, and I had to make it up this winding staircase with lots of snakes attached to the walls that came down the stairs after me successively. Eventually I realized that I couldn't kill them, so I had to run away until I found&nbsp; better weapon. I ran out to this tent that had lights strung under it as if for a party. My brother was there and he was hitting this oversized bumble bees with a bat. I pissed one of the bees off and it came after me. I was more afraid of that than of the snakes, but I managed to pin it on the ground and squish it. It still scares me to think about this bee. So then Sam handed me a telephone and I ran back into the house to fight off the snakes. As I was fighting them an beating them about with my phone, they came off of the wall and began chasing me. I ran outside and up the stairs, and closed the basement door behind me and locked it. Then I felt safe and secure inside my house.   According to the gypsies, snakes mean, "Someone you are not sure about is actually a very good friend who will work for your well-being. Given recognition, this person will turn out to be the best friend you have ever had." I'd be willing to bet money that's about Jessie. Bees mean, "Profit; gain. If the bees fly away, you will be rid of your worries." The bees flew away after I killed the one that came after me. Pretty bizarre, huh?

      Current Mood: Out of my Element  Current Music: "Battle of the Universe"  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   I Am A:  Chaotic Good Elf Bard Mage     Alignment:    Chaotic Good  characters are independent types with a strong belief in the value of goodness. They have little use for governments and other forces of order, and will generally do their own things, without heed to such groups.     Race:    Elves  are the eldest of all races, although they are generally a bit smaller than humans. They are generally well-cultured, artistic, easy-going, and because of their long lives, unconcerned with day-to-day activities that other races frequently concern themselves with. Elves are, effectively, immortal, although they can be killed. After a thousand years or so, they simply pass on to the next plane of existance.     Primary Class:    Bards  are the entertainers. They sing, dance, and play instruments to make other people happy, and, frequently, make money. They also tend to dabble in magic a bit.     Secondary Class:    Mages  harness the magical energies for their own use. Spells, spell books, and long hours in the library are their loves. While often not physically strong, their mental talents can make up for this.

      Current Mood: Lonely but Hopeful  Current Music: "Ocean Gypsy," Blackmore's Night&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Nathan just left a short bit ago for his lovely home in Abingdon. It was a great weekend, but I find myself alone again for the next two weeks.&nbsp;We both&nbsp;think we are&nbsp;alone, and to the casual observer, we seem alone. But I never really feel alone, and whether he knows it or not, he is never without my heart and my love. I find myself more eager for August 30th with every passing day...Oh, to spend every night in his arms, every day in his company. Soon...so very soon...but not nearly soon enough.  &nbsp;  Friday the most wonderful thing&nbsp;happened.&nbsp;For a few days I&nbsp;had&nbsp;thought he would surprise me, but I thought perhaps that was wishful thinking. I got off an hour late on&nbsp;Friday because I covered for my assistant. (I get to go in an hour late tomorrow. Hehe.)&nbsp;I expected him to call, as planned, at&nbsp;6:00 when he got off. Well, I didn't get off till&nbsp;6, but it didn't matter&nbsp;because he called at 6:15. I expected him to say "I'm on the road, I'll be there in a few hours." Instead his lovely Civic pulled in my&nbsp;driveway behind me. Out he stepped, solitary rose in hand, as handsome as ever, and I am sure&nbsp;my ears were covered in my smile. I wrapped myself up in him and the glee I felt at his presence.&nbsp;No one has every done something like that for me&nbsp;before. It was wonderful.&nbsp;We spent&nbsp;Friday night in my bed, cherishing each other's touch,&nbsp;and drifted to sleep together.  &nbsp;  Saturday we woke several times before actually getting up. When we finally did, we traveled about the town making preparations, and then we headed out to the lake. Not the popular lake (Smith Mountain), but&nbsp;the secluded, forested, and ever so magical&nbsp;Philpott. I have long felt that&nbsp;Philpott Lake does not belong where it sits. Nathan concurred. It looks like it should be in the Isles somewhere,&nbsp;hidden by&nbsp;the rolling hills. Instead it is 30 minutes from my house, quite convenient&nbsp;I must say. We swam for maybe&nbsp;10 minutes, but tired of that&nbsp;quickly as the&nbsp;swimming hole was crowded. We decided instead to get a paddleboat and take it out on the&nbsp;Loch. I had&nbsp;never been on a boat before,&nbsp;and it was great fun. Especially being with him, secluded out on the water. I sat on the back and dangled my feet in the water, leaning back every now and then for a kiss. We talked of the future most of the day. Of children and houses and jobs and friends. The game plan is to get married, eventually build a house&nbsp;somewhere secluded (probably Maine or&nbsp;Washington), and raise a few kids (he wants two...three would be better ;D). After discussion of&nbsp;my goals, he&nbsp;decided that teaching was just what he wanted to do, he&nbsp;just had never realized it. At least I have made one positive impression on the boy.&nbsp;Saturday night we watched  The Butterfly Effect  with my family. I must say it was one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Much like  Donnie Darko  in its dark outlook on life and its twisted sense of time. Granted, not as good as  Donnie Darko , it was still a very good movie that any self-sacrificing pessimist should see. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sunday we lazed about for the first half of the day, and around&nbsp;1:00 we went to Roanoke to B&amp;N, spent way too much money, and then came&nbsp;home.&nbsp;I finally bought&nbsp; Eye of the World  and I started reading it shortly after he left. I've read about 10 pages, not counting the Prologue, and I am&nbsp;impressed with the writing style, though I am not yet into the plot enough to really comment on the skill involved there. He promised me he would read&nbsp; The Stranger&nbsp; tomorrow night.&nbsp;It's one of my favorite books, and I really hope he likes it. Anyway, he left at about 8:00, and I'll talk to him on the phone once he gets out on the interstate.  &nbsp;  I now possess  The Stranger, The&nbsp;Plague,&nbsp;The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, The First&nbsp;Man, A Happy Death ,&nbsp;and  Between Hell and Reason ,&nbsp;all by Albert Camus.&nbsp;(I also have a biographical book that I suppose I technically stole from the public library, but they never&nbsp;asked for it back, so it's not my fault.) If you don't know this man, please look into him. He's an existentialist writer to some&nbsp;extent, but he's not annoying and bothersome like&nbsp;Ralph Waldo Emerson or Henry David Thoreau. He's dark, morbid, and he has&nbsp;very valid points and observations about the way the world and human beings work, all presented in&nbsp;tales of intriguing characters and&nbsp;realistic plots. I am still missing his plays  Caligula, State of Seige,  and  The Just,&nbsp; his non-fiction&nbsp;work  The Rebel , and I would love to have a copy in print of his essay  The Myth of Sisyphus , though I have read it several times. I&nbsp;have all of his fiction novels, his collection of short stories  (Exile and the Kingdom ), and his political essays ( Between Hell and Reason)  so I am satisfied for&nbsp;the time being.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  This song is my all-time theme song, so I feel I should&nbsp;share its&nbsp;beauty with the world...&nbsp;    Tried to take it all away,  Learn her freedom... just inside a day,  And find her soul to find there fears are laid...  Tried to make her love their own,  They took her love... they left her there,  They gave her nothing back that she would want to own...   Gold and silver rings and stones,  Dances slowly off the moon,  No one else could know, she stands alone...  Sleeping dreams will reach for her,  She can not say the words they need,  She knows she's alone and she is free...   Ocean Gypsy of the moon,  The sun has made a thousand nights for you to hold...  Ocean Gypsy where are you?  The shadows followed by the stars have turned to gold...  Turned to gold...   Then she met a hollow soul,  Filled him with her light and was consoled,  She was the moon and he the sun was gold...  Eyes were blinded with his light...  The sun she gave reflected back the night  The moon was waning almost out of sight...   Softly Ocean Gypsy calls...  Silence holds the stars a while,  They smile sadly for her where she falls...  Just the time before the dawn,  The sea is hushed the ocean calls her,  Day has taken her and now she's gone...   Ocean Gypsy of the moon,  The sun has made a thousand nights for you to hold...  Ocean Gypsy where are you?  The shadows followed by the stars have turned to gold...  Turned to gold...   No one noticed when she died,  Ocean Gypsy shackled to the tide,  The ebbing waves, the turning spreading white...   Something gone within her eyes,  Her fingers, lifeless, stroked the sand,  Her battered soul was lost,  She was abandoned...   Silken threads like wings still shine,  Wind swept pleasures still make patterns  in her lovely hair... so dark and fine...  Stands on high beneath the seas, cries no more,  her tears have dried...  Oceans weep for her, the ocean sighs...   Ocean Gypsy of the moon,  The sun has made a thousand nights for you to hold...  Ocean Gypsy where are you?  The shadows followed by the stars have turned to gold...  Turned to gold...    Whew this post got&nbsp;long!&nbsp;I think I'm going to start signing these posts with my lovely sig lines I created for my message boards. Hope you all&nbsp;like&nbsp;them!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;            I miss the Ocean...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Current Mood: Upset and Contemplative  Current Music: "Meet in the Middle," Diamond Rio   I was talking to Nathan, and I told this to him about what I want from life. I realized it was worthy of being saved for posterity.      "I want to be a Mother to my children, an inspiration to my students, a teacher of not just knowledge, but how you should live, how we should treat each other and the world around us. I want to be your friend, your lover, your inspiration, and your wife. I want to be a good daughter, a good person, and I want to be happy in my simplicity. And yeah, I want to see the world, I want to know things about the universe, but what better knowledge is there than knowing that I have improved the lives of but one child, that one other soul benefited from its contact with me? I learn so much from each and every person I meet, each life I touch, each soul I commune with. I get a little closer to that ultimate truth. For I don't believe it's in us to do it alone, we need the help of every single other soul. *That* is why we are reincarnated, so that we can learn from others, so that we meet more souls, and learn from those meetings. You and I are partners in this journey, and I want to make you happy. I want to make so many people happy. Even the people that I hate, I wish I could make them happy. By improving others, I improve myself, and that's why I want to be a teacher. I want to show children how to learn from the people around them, from the Earth around them and the universe around them, in the hopes that they can improve themselves and everyone else. You want things to change on a grand scale, you think you can't do anything to make this place better. Well, my goals are smaller, and they are in the hearts and minds of every child I have ever met and have yet to meet, and I plan to change them for the better. *That* is what will make me happy."

      Current Mood: Exhausted, but enthused and optimistic Current Music: "Anarchy Camp," Nofx  Camp is in full swing, we're settled in our routine (not comfortable, since that leads to accidents according to our insurance company ;D). The kids wear me out, but I adore them all. I have my favorites of course, like Aina. She and her brother we adopted from Russia. She is just a beautiful child, sort of small for her age, but very sweet and very athletic. A bit of a tomboy, but those are my favorite. Sparkling blue eyes and a beautiful complexion. Then there's Ian. Great name, first of all. He's allergic to all milk products and any kind of nuts or nut oils. His parents bring him a special kind of milk made from rice, and we feed him certain snacks that are okay for him. Now, for kids that misbehave I might have a problem making special accomodations. With him, I don't mind a bit. He's so adorable and he always says please and thank you. When the other kids make fun of him or he gets hurt, I get very protective and upset. No one makes fun of Aina, and she never gets really hurt because she's a tough kid, so I don't have to worry about it with her.   I miss Nathan, but I had a good day, and thus I am in a good. When I'm in a good mood, I am patient, and I realize that soon I will be with him constantly, and I can wait a few weeks for that. I'll see him next week, and that is not so far away. He's content in his job now, and his Mother is backing off a bit I think because of that. I am better off than many people in this world, most even, and I should cherish what I have.   And so I shall...  I love you, Nathan!

      Current Mood: Depressed, Exhausted, and Lonely Current Music: "Life Sucks," Osker   "I'll cope with this flaw that's my life"...   Somehow I guess, yeah, I will. It sucks big time though. Working 8 hours a day, on my feet all of it, putting up with and being responsible for 30 screaming second graders, coming home to my family instead of Nathan, and feeling so very alone in the world.    "If I could just grow up then everything would be just fine"    *sigh* It's true that in just a few short weeks I will be in utter heaven. Going to school full time (which I missed so badly last semester during my extended illness), being with Nathan every waking and sleeping moment...Perhaps this is the storm before the calm. But in just a few years, all this will be nothing. Nathan and I will start our lives together, and live them forever together. Just a little time...a little growing up...  On a lighter note, this weekend was good. Friday Nathan was late, as usual, because of his stupid grandmother. That night we went to good ole FCHS to watch some crappy fireworks and hang out with my friends. It was fun just to be with them again. I think Friday I will see if we can't hang out or do something, since Nathan can't come. Saturday we spent the entire day and night at my grandparents, and that sucked, including the fireworks they bought. More like suped up sparklers...Anyway, Nathan was miserable there. Sunday we just hung out after he had to sweet talk his Mom into letting him stay. (I get so tired of that bitch!! Urgh!!!) Monday he left me. No sooner did he get 15 minutes out before I found out I got off *five* hours early. I called him but his Mother wouldn't let him stay the afternoon. (Again with her being a bitch!!)    "It's not depressing, it just takes a little work.  I try a little harder,  Try a little harder than everyone else..."

      Current Mood: Depressed and Lonely Current Music: "Oh, Susanna," The Be Good Tanyas  My fucking god today sucked. Sucked so bad I just claimed to have a god. My whole body aches, even my ass from falling down. It was field trip day at the YMCA Summer Camp, and so we went roller-skating. I am not too bad, I do alright. No fancy tricks or anything, but I don't really fall down (Well, there was that once, but that's because a kid ran into me). So my feet are killing me because I skated for almost 5 hours straight. My legs hurt from over-exertion, and my feelings are shattered.   We went to a park afterwards to play and hangout and whatnot. The kids that had their own blades went around the pavilion there a few times. Mostly we just sat around and watched the kids play. Well, we had a kickball and a softball field, so I thought, what the heck, I love kickball, we'll play. So I gathered enough kids and counselors and took them out to the field. We got started, I kicked a double and then Justin kicked me home. I was having fun. We got out in the field and I ran for a kick in the outfield behind third base, and fell in the gigantic mudhole out there from all the rain, twisting my ankle. I limped back and Owen said, why don't you play first and I'll play back here, because apparently I didn't recover the ball fast enough to suit him (what happened to it being just a game; we set such lovely examples). So I played first base, and sure enough the next kick was way out behind me, so I ran to get it. Then I wasn't running fast enough and everyone was laughing and making fun of me. For years (every year of my life) people made fun of me for all number of things. I learned to let it slide off my back. When I went to college no one did that anymore. Everyone there appreciated me for who I was and didn't mock me (well, except Nathan...). So I am not used to that degree of ridicule, especially from Owen who is supposed to be my friend. I wanted to sit down and cry, but I didn't. I just walked away from the field. I will let it roll off, I will not let them get me upset.   I'm not good at much, but I am a strong person. That they cannot take away from me...

      Current Mood: Bewildered Current Music: "Prophecy," Queensryche  You may not believe what I am about to say, but Nathan was there when I found out about it, so you can ask him. Remember the dream with Owen? Well, last night, Mother checked her messages on her phone and said that Owen called. He told her that a 15-year-old had stolen her Mother's car and plowed into his front end. In my previous entry, I recorded this about that dream,"I think what he did get to read had something to do with a wreck and regret, and I think it was something personal to him." The wreck part has come true...I'm not sure I want to know the personal part.  Nathan's gone, but I'll see him in 5 days. I cannot wait. He is all alone at his house...I miss him so...
