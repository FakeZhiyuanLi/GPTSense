						   We had a fantastic nite.  There was a problem at first with the surprise party.  I had Tiffany, a friend of Laci's over decorating the apt and Laci calls.  We talk for a minute and she has to put me on hold (she is at work) so I start talking to Tiffany while on hold and Laci comes back and catches me talking to someone, she said "who were you talking to", I said noone.  Then she says WHO WERE YOU TALKING TO!!  Then I said I was just singing to the radio.  Needless to say she was pissed, thinking someone was over and I was cheating on her.  All this and we are trying to surprise her.  So after about an hour of trying to convince her noone was over she came home and we surprised her.    Then we went out to Grahams dance club.  It was packed we had tons of fun.  Laci was druuuuuuuunk.  A friend of hers, Traci was with us and she was drunk too.  We were dancing all night, we closed the place down.  So, we are out on the dance floor, getting down, and Traci a friend of Laci's comes over and they start kissing.  WOW!!!  Anyways as you can tell just from that little story we had a good time.

						   Well, tomorrow is my fiances birthday and I got her a cow.  You say a cow?  What do you mean?  Well, they are these painted little cows that they sell at Hallmark.  Anyways, she loves these things but they are a little pricey for a friggin cow, but today she dropped the hint she wants some flowers.  Well, I guess she is gonna have to be satisfied with the cow, because it is saturday at 630pm and the flowers aren't gonna happen.    We are celebrating her birthday tonite.  She is getting a little surprise birthday party and has no idea.  I have never been to, or planned one, but this is gonna be so awesome.  She is at work now and will be home in about 3hrs, so we will see how this is gonna work.  I called her a little bit ago and she had said, "I just wanna go to a movie",  we had planned to actually go out and dance and what not tonite, so I hope she is feeling allright.  I mean she IS getting a surprise party.  I have blabbed enough, until next time.

						   HELLO WORLD!!!  I love these things they are so fun.  You can go and read about anyones life, the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Blogs are such a great idea.  I wonder who "invented" these Al Gore?  Well, I am getting married June 5th, wow, me, I am gonna be a married man.  I never thought that day would come but it is fast approaching.  I am sure I will be posting things on here about that day and everything prior to that day, and everything else that goes on in my life from day to day, and who knows maybe from hour to hour.  My mother is coming in from NYC the 26th of this month, I am sure that is gonna be a blast.  She will be staying with me for like a week and a half that should be fun(sigh)!
