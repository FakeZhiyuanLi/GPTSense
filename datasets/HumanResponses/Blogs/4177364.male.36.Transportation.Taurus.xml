      Went to Rush Copley ER on Friday at 6pm. Was diagnossed with a Cervical Strain and was given off of work till 6/2. They prescribed Vicadin (505mg generic) has made no difference and back is still in pain, also have had only 3-4 hours of sleep per night. Due to the accident, I lost the sheduled OT (2 hours) Thursday and Friday. Also, Saturday 8 hours OT was available and 8 hours Double Time (plus holiday pay, 3x) on Monday. Due to accident, I can’t do any of it.

       Thursday (5/27) i was in a car accident.  A car turned infront of me, crossing my lane to enter a strip mall on North Aurora Rd about 100 yards east of the intersection at Eola. The traffic light was out and the traffic to turn left (southbound Eola) was backed up almost 200 yards. The North Aurora Rd. has 2 lanes heading in each direction and where this other car came from, was a left turn lane from the opposite direction. My (right) lane was clear to the stoplight. The speed limit there is 45, but i was already slowing down, between 35-40. The car that pulled out in front of me came from that left turn lane and with the cars in my left lane, i never saw her coming till she was almost 3/4 of the way into my lane. I hit the brakes and tried to turn to miss her, after hitting her I slid up into the grass. From looking at the skid marks, i was only on the brakes for about 15 feet before i hit her right front corner of her car with the driver side corner of mine. She admitted fault to me, the police officer and to the 2 witnesses there as well as the cop gave her a ticket for failure to yield while turning left. When i hit her, i tore off the entire front end of her car. She was driving a 2002 Lexus RX 300. She wasn't hurt; i did jerk hard and hit my head.  I Went to Enterprise to get a rental after the Jeep went to the body shop. State Farm said that even though it was her fault, they couldn’t pay till they got a hold of her. Enterprise took $100 from my debit (actually only the autorization from the CC company for the $100 for deposit if needed). They first gave me a Chevy Cavalier. I tried driving it was very cramped. After taking care of business, I went back to Enterprise and they gave me the 2004 Taurus they just got back in.

       6/1  called my regular doctor; he was booked so they got me in with Dr. Michelle Bardack. She wrote me off work, 6/1 –6/7 and prescriptions for Valium (5mg generic) and Ibuprofen (800mg). Also prescribed massage therapy.  6/2  State Farm finally called and said they got a hold of her and that everything would be 100% paid. My insurance office called the next day to say the same thing. Don at the body shop called and told me the damage was at $4500 and not sure if repairable (they recommened to the insurance to total it).  6/4  started therapy at Athletico twice a week. Also went back to doc, put me off till the 11th.  6/7  returned to Dr. Bardack. Wrote to return to work on 6/14 on FAX that Lesley sent.  6/8  the body shop called and said the repairs were being started.  6/10  Talked to Leslie (works contact from home office), agreed to go back on the 14th as original written by doc. Dr. Bardack did send the 3M medical info to Leslie but had a return to the dr on the 14th and work on the 15th. I told Leslie I feel good enough to get back on the 14th and she agreed it was ok since I have the info doc originally wrote.

       6/14  tried calling Leslie in refrence to going back to work today, she is out of the office till July 6th. Called Eileen (facility nurse) at work and the only info that she received was the return to doc today and work tomorrow the 15th. Eileen also gave me phone # for John Blatner (the company psycholigist). Dr. Bardack’s office called back said if I felt good enough, no need for apointment today and I could return on the 15th with no restrictions. I also asked the dr’s office to fax that info to Eileen. I called the body shop, they said they were waiting on parts, paint is done. Don hoped to send it out to get the allignment done on Friday. I haven’t heard anything from the State Farm since 6/2.   6/15  returned to work for unrestricted 8 hours. Was in some pain but thought it was manageable. Did have 2 hours physical therapy before work, everything felt ok. While at work, Wes talked to be about a safety violation of mine on the 26th of May. I told him I didn’t remember it as all the accident stuff was hard to get past, but I said that I wouldn’t deny it when he said others saw me. He told me that the saftey team decided that he should just talk to me about it and make sure I knew it was wrong. I thanked him and apologized for my actions.  6/16  woke up in pain. Went to work, left after one hour, pain was increasing. Got appointment with Dr. Bardack at 4:45. She filled out med info sheet for 3M limiting me to 4 hours.  6/17  when I got to work, Eileen said she (as in 3M) needed in print from Doctor’s office "Only 4 hours per day". The medical sheet to 3M is read as vague because it was marked 1-4 hour’s sit and 1-4 stand; they read it as 8 hours. While at Athletico, agreed to 3 times a week for therapy.  6/18  Called Doctor’s office and asked for something from the office, from the doctor to be faxed to Eileen. Dr. Bardack is off till Monday, they said they would ask Dr. Paras to do it. Saturday was scheduled; I lost another 8 OT.

       6/21  had therapy in the morning, but once at work, I was hurting the first hour. I talked to Wes at 5:15 telling him I needed to leave due to the pain. He suggested that if I need the cold packs to work, maybe I should be off work.  with suggestions like that, the ass should become a doctor! Called the body shop, they believed they would have it ready today.  6/22   Gonna swing by body shop to check on truck. Back hurts, will freeze before work. Need to ask for some painkillers from doc on Wednesday. Got the Jeep back. Need to go back for a couple of problems.  6/23  had appointment with doc. No new drugs; she did send me to hospital for more x-rays and to take some labs at the office too. Bardack also wants me to return next week to Paras; thinking his specialty may be of help with this. Only worked till 4:30, pain is worse. After work I went to the Rush for the x-rays. I called Bardack’s nurse and asked if there was anything I could do for the pain. They called back with a prescription of Percaset, but I have to pick up the script, they can’t call it in because it is considered to be a controlled substance. The office closed before I could get back down there, have to go tomorrow morning. Work had to force OT for Thursday and Friday; I would have had to work 2 hours OT each day.  6/24  Went to therapy at 10:30, Maria really worked on the right side of my back good. Left therapy at noon so I could drive to Yorkville to get my script for the medication. After I got it, I dropped it off at Walgreens to pick it up after work. Work was rough, but I did get thru 4 hours, first time this week. Have noticed some things I don’t like on the truck, the new bug guard is all-wrong, I have to call the body shop and get the Jeep back in. Didn’t take the new meds yet.  6/25  woke up in a lot of pain. Took 1 percaset at 10am, 1pm I could still feel its influence…very helpful. Back does hurt a lot, work is gonna suck. They announced that Saturday would be scheduled, could even work more than 8 hours. Also said that Sunday maybe offerred. I keep losing OT and since I can’t work, when I do get back to full duty, I will be on the bottom of the OT list. Called the body shop, gonna go in on Monday to get center cap fixed. I also asked them about the bug deflector.  6/26  Pain. Morning is still tuff to get moving, more so than normal. The Endocet (percaset) helps, but it only lasts soo long. I still will only take one at a time, I am afraid of how 2 will make me feel. Later in the evening I took Naproxen and Tylenol at the same time. I feel a vibration in the wheel that I can’t identify. I’m gonna go by Brian’s (hope he is back from vacation) before I go back to Cars on Monday.  6/27  Pain wakes me early, too hard to sleep during that day. Took Endocet and then Ibuprofen again today. Can’t seem to get comfortable anywhere. Every night, after sleeping, I wake up sweating; some times on the couch, others in bed and the A/C is on, set at 80.

       6/28    KILLER KARMA.   Was in a lot of pain at work today, at 5:20 I went to go tell Wes that I was going to go home due to the pain. He said that we needed to talk about my safety violation (from May 26th). He then told me that I was suspended for the next 2 days with no pay and that "I should be real careful as my job is in Jeopardy."  What the hell is that suspose to mean? He also made remarks saying that the suspension was a result of my not remembering my "violation". He then said that because of my accident it must be due to "post traumatic stress disorder". When the fuck did he become a doctor.  6/29  should be a fun day! Called and left message for Blatner’s service as needing someone to talk to. Called Karen Ryder and discussed my accident. She did say, that while investigating the incident that one of the witnesses said that 'they' offered to move the truck but i said, "no need, i'll get it" and used the truck to push it. Because of that statement, they wanted the punsihment to fit the action. She was as confused as i was as to what Wes said yestaurday, "You need to be real careful around here, your job is in jeopardy!" She said that she is part of the safety steering committe and she knew there was nothing like this in my safety record, so she has no clue why he said that.  6/30  did nothing, just can’t think. Did go see Spider-Man 2...cool movie!  7/01  therapy and 4 hours at work.  7/02  therapy. Did 2.5 hours at work. Wes again giving me shit because for some reason he doesn’t know what my restrictions are; granted they have been the same since 6/16.  7/03 – 05  long weekend off, didn’t do much. Did spend time priming my front axle as it looked like shit. those bastards, when they replaced my axle, they did it with one that was covered in rust.  the axles seems to work fine, just looked horrible.  Back was really hurting though, had to keep it short. Good for the day.  Gary called; he has the race tickets and said we get a bus ride to the race also, with free snacks and beer.  Free tickets to the Nextel race in Joliet...too fucking cool!  7/06  Dr. Lima’s (a shrink with Dreyer) office called, best they can do is 2 weeks. After therapy I need to call Dr. Paras’s office and ask for a referral. I’m just too tired of dealing.  7/08  Dr. Paras gave me a referral to a psyhologist, not a psycaitrist. Also has me on same rstrictions for next 2 weeks plus a new muscle relaxer to take at night.

       7/15  It’s getting harder and harder to remember to write down the days’ activities. Gary and I went to the race on  7/11 . I was really hurting, but didn’t let it bother me, as I wanted to have fun. When I got home, I iced, took muscle relaxers and was asleep before 10pm.  7/12  was horrible; I was soo sore. Besides my back and shoulders, my knees hurt badly too. I only worked 2.25 hours. Had therapy at 6:30pm, but nothing helped.  7/13  was a little better, but still hurt. Should have gone for shots, but was too lazy and too sore.  7/14  had therapy early, didn’t use stim, I hurt so much I took one of the new muscle relaxers before work. By 5pm I was dying to leave. The 13th, 14th &amp; 15th I worked 3 hours. As much as I wanted to leave early those days, I pushed till 5:30. All week, everyday they have been needing 120 hours of OT…i would have gotten forced everyday. In doing so, I find myself taking muscle relaxers more and longer periods on ice. Numbing the pain is only good for so long. Taking the percaset first thing in the morning is the only thing that allows me to get past the pain first off. It’s not getting better and I’m tired of all the drugs and the ice. I made an appointment today for a shrink at Dreyer for the 30th at 11:40am. Maybe she can help, I’m just so tired of all the pain. The only people I seem to talk to anymore is people at Friday’s and Karen (she has enough of her own problems). I made an attempt to talk to dad about how I have been feeling and it was the first time I have ever seen him back away from the conversation. Things must be bad if I’m scarring him away. For some reason my left arm and shoulder have been in a lot of pain. My left knee still hurts real bad.

       7/16  I worked 3.5 hours; think it was a mistake as I hurt a lot.  7/17  I was under the Jeep, painting the axle that was replaced (black flat primer). When I got done, I was using the gloss enhancer to clean the hood, get rid of dirt and overspray. As I did, I noticed problems in the paint from the body shop. I also noticed that not only was the bumper the wrong color (they gave me a flat black one over the gloss I had) but my bumper guard (on the passenger side) doesn’t even fit the bumper. Also ripped 35+ CDs to the puter. Took the old (store bought) CDs to Disc Replay, they only took 5 for $10. They only take those that have no scratches. I need $ bad enough to sell a large part of my CD collection.  7/18  did nothing. Helped out Karen at Tiger, she bought me a spindle of CDRs for helping.  7/19  felt well, therapy hit me hard and I stayed at work for the 4 hours. It hurt, won’t know till tomorrow if it was that stupid to work the 4. Tomorrow is Maria’s last day at Athletico.  7/20  Mom’s being a real pain in the ass. She emailed on the 11th and then again on the 12th. I emailed back telling her that I was just busy and tired and would write soon. This past weekend (Friday-Sunday) she must have tried 5 or 6 times. Thanks to my answering machine message, she won’t leave a message. She just doesn’t understand that I don’t want to talk.  7/21  worked 3 hours yestaurday, did nothing much last night. When I got up today, I thought maybe I was feeling better. Went about 2 hours before I gave in to the pain and took the percaset. As I told Wes Tuesday, everyday I go to work, I hurt…it just depends on that day how long I can withstand the pain. And that is the problem. I can’t even remember the last day that I wasn’t in some kind of pain. Even on good days, I hurt. I thought this morning I was doing good, did 2 loads of laundry. But as I was on the stairs and I felt no pain, I bent down for something and took a while to get back up. I can’t believe that this is just going get to better in time, the pain sucks. As I am totally broke, going to go back over to Disc Repaly tonight and try to sell some more CDs. I seperated the best condition ones from the rest. Hopefully I’ll get some more money from them

      the body shop that fixed my truck has a list of things to fix. i called the insurance Tuesday about the other damaged wheel. it seems the body shop just called it in, they new about it for the last week. the insurance company, State Farm, has dragged there feet with this, but now the body shop is doing the same. this is one of State Farm's certified shops called Cars Collision. they charge State Farm $5300 for the repairs, took a month to get my truck back. 600 miles later, here is the laundry list of shit they have to fix: 1) paint - dirt in paint on front end and hood 2) front bumper - they got a flat black one, mine was gloss - also, the old bumper guard (original equip) won't fit on this replacement bumper. 3) hood - not lined up correctly 4) bug deflector - the one they put on was different, the new one moves around while driving 50mph or faster. They ordered the new one. 5) windshield washer - the washer pump is in the receiver which is in the front fender. the pump isn't working 6) passenger wheel - inside of rim is bent being repair, may have some damaged to the tire and allingment. *7)now this one is a good one.  about a week after i had the car back, i told the guys at the body shop that my driver's door isn't lining up right.  they told me that it is normal wear and tear due to using the door as leverage to get in and out.  there lies one problem, even as a big guy, i don't use the door, i use the steering wheel as leverage.  so yestaurday i went thru the car wash, first time as they said i needed to wait atleast a month due to the paint.  as the car got a wash, i received a shower.  that car has never leaked and i got soaked. fuckers will hear again from me.  i'm sometimes afraid to drive the thing as more may break. it sucks, it's just not my truck yet. but that is just it, it is MY truck. i'm keeping this beast. things that sucks with the insurance is they won't settle, or pay anything at all, till all the medical is done. so i'm screwed on getting other repairs done or doing my lift or new rims and tires or a new bumper. the only extra cash coming in now is from selling shit i own. granted, i do have a lot of shit, i suppose it's about time i got rid of some of it. so, music CD's, VHS movies, some DVD movies, a couple of books, PC video games and then i can pick away at my collections of trading cards and comics and diecast cars.  it's hard to think about how normal my truck will be, or how fun it will be to play off road again when i hurt like hell, i can't enjoy.

      No matter what you add to cheap pizza, it still tastes like shit. i try to save a little and i get the blandest tasting shit i have ever had. hell, this time i tried to add some pineapple and extra cheese and still shit. i figure now what they must do is just drown everything in water so that it has no taste. generic versions of other foods are usually pretty good. bread is the same. even the fake Mac & Cheese ain't bad, but not Generic peanut butter, that stuff sucks. food always has generic versions of the real shit. they also have cheaper versions. generic water, milk, ice-cream, butter are all fine.  Beer, has cheaper versions and some cheap beer really sucks.  but i would hate to try generic beer.

        TIME   we never seem to have enough of it, time flies, where has the time gone? so many statements about time and yet it is always the same....we just never have enough of it.   TIME  ....Before the car accident, i never had enough time. I'd work 8-10 hours a day and spend every weekend catching up on shit. well now, i'm working 5 hours, 3 hours paid by medical; no overtime at all. so, now i'm broke and have tons of time. Weekends, shit i don't do anything anymore besides relax and go to the bar on Saturday night. the local has karoke and as much as i hate hearing some people sing, it can be quite funny and besides, there are always lots of ladies. But, i'm there to have a few beers and relax. this past Saturday this woman, a real pain in the ass to everyone (I've nick named her Diane Chambers - as from the show Cheers, as she has an opinion about everyone and won't shut up) is pestering me about why i should go hit on these nice looking women. my thought was that i'm relaxing, i feel good and if they want me, they know where i am. ok, well that didn't happen...it did Friday night, met a nice lady; she walked away from her date to come say HI. i thought it was kool. back to   TIME  . Weekends now, relax. Weekdays, i actually do a lot more than before. With only 5 hours work, i should have more time. But when i start the day on muscle relaxers and heat, get off work to come home to muscle relaxers and ice, well it sucks. Feels like an 8 hour day of work. i hate the pain, i hate even having to think ahead about doing normal shit as it may hurt like a bitch.   TIME  , weekdays last too long, the pain is bad. i sleep less these days, makes the days even longer. Any other time, i would luv to take a walk, exercise, but i can't as i know i need to go into work as fresh as possible to last 5 hours. To get thru the day, to not get mad about shit, to relax as much as possible, day dreaming can help. for months I'd lost my creativity. i would day dream about things i wanted to build, things i wanted to do, things i wanted to write. "Eating Peanuts" refers to many things, a new story, a way of relaxing, a distraction that can suspend the pain for hours. Not to mention, it just sounds goofy. What exactly is it.....Most read on, not giving that up yet.   TIME  , during this time at home, must keep mind rolling or I'll wind up a couch potato for sure. And just where did "couch potato" come from? is a potato supposed to be lazy? Any more than a corn cob or green bean? a tit seems lazy, could be a "couch tit"? that sounds weird too. Speaking of weird, i'm listening to Roger Water's album 'Amused to Death', this is a weird album, much like his others. And as odd as it is, it is so easy to listen to. so, trying to stay amused, i play some dumb games, post on here, add occasionally to my web pages (i get bored with those occasionally too) and then there is the online personals. Trying to find someone that compliments, challenges and completes me. Damn, when i was a kid, I'd never thought about any of that shit. the women did, hell i just wanted the sex. Now older, it's the other way around. Women have tried for the relationships, they failed and they just want sex. Not that is bad, but now i need more....that is so funny. ok, i keep getting distracted on my topic of TIME and now i actually have to do some things before work. Yuck, one of those things is call the insurance company and raise hell. Will have to update on that later and also have to tell about the fight i was almost in Friday...Quite funny actually.

        The Beginning   It seems as time goes by i find one thing or another to occupy my time. and as i try more things it always seems that i forget how i got here to begin with. "The Beginning" is my first time, my blog, my thoughts and the world that i am floating in. Web pages, i have played with different things and ideas, but this will allow me to express who the wizard is behind the curtain.    Twisted Karma   Most people don't believe in karma, many don't believe in anything. i have my moments, my karma, is very twisted. good and bad, ying and yang, karma i didn't really believe in till 2 years ago. i have to say, i'm afraid to have anything good happen, as in every turn in the last 2 years, once there was good, the bad just wasn't a fun trip.    2002  , won a years supply of M&Ms...that was funny as shit, a package came with 365 coupons for individual bags of M&amp;Ms. as much as i loved those things, i hardly eat them anymore. also that year i participated in an online nascar fantasy game. the game owner was dumb enough to make the entry free figuring they would have a lot of people buying merchandise from there store. there problem started when when they allowed up to 50 people to win prizes....for the first 12 races, 42 were playing. i won every week and when they decided to make a change and charge people, it was time to cash out. so for free, i got 2 hats (usually $25 ea) and a t-shirt. Hell, i was doing well. then at work i injured my back, restricted duty, physical therapy and drugs for 4 months. that sucked.    2003  , the little things, the occasional smiles from hot women, helping someone you don't even know, just doing a good deed, these always slip the mind. the Boy Scouts motto is 'do a good turn daily'. easy to do as a kid, but as we grow up, things tend to slip away. me, i still try to do a good turn daily. anyway, this year was filled with new girlfriends, keeping my truck from getting stuck in the mud and just having fun. June i injured my shoulder, but not too bad. July 1, had to leave work early as i didn't feel good. on the 3rd, my doc checked me into the hospital for cellulitus in my left leg; i was there for 8 days. several doctors, to many nurses, pretty good food and $1200 per day room; thanks to work for awesome insurance. later, after i was back home and heading in a better direction, the doc told me, "one more day, if you had waited one more day to come see me, you would have lost your left leg from the knee down." thanks doc, that is one thought that has never left me. took 6 months to rehab my leg to get back to normal. one month after getting home, my friend and i went to the local riverboat casino. we went for the food. after eating, i only had $30 in my wallet, but decided to play anyway. started with a 25 cent video poker, it's cheap and fun to play. lost $10 in 2 minutes. put in my last $20, deuces wild game and i was betting only 4 quarters (5 was max) and i was dealt a royal straight flush. freaked me out, i won $250. the old bag sitting next to me had to point out, "If you had made max bet, you would have won $1000." thanks bitch. i played $100 and walked away with the rest. of course my best friend (John) was calling me an asshole for winning. as we were about to leave, i stopped at another dueces wild machine, had to stop. it played 3 hands at a time, so i played the $2 bet. first 3 hands, won $75, John called me a dick, so i kept playing. next hand, won $150, he called me a dick again.....it's always nice having your friends call you names when you win. this game deals you one hand, you select what cards you want to save, it saves them for 3 hands and then deals again. i kept playing. after 10 minutes or so, i realized something. i had been hitting the "Max Bet" button as i was playing, i thought it was just $6. nope, it was 15 credits x $2 = $30 a hand. Oops. holy shit, $30 at a time. i did this for a few hands, kept winning and listened to my foul mouth co-hurt next to me. the last hand, i was dealt 3 dueces...the dueces were wild. i froze, new that 3 hands with 3 wilds was gonna be real nice. after the new cards were dealt, i just stared at the machine trying to figure what i won. my 3 hands: 5 of a kind, royal straight flush and 4 dueces....that last one was the kicker. i won $2290. that was a good day. it seemed to be Karma smiling at me, giving me something nice for dealing with my leg. 2 months later, i was carted out of work in an ambulance, i couldn't breath or move. wound up being pleurisy (the muscle around my lungs were basically bruised).  i didn't need that. come November, i won a trip for 2 to Las Vegas from my works x-mas party.  took my dad out there in March of 2004 to see an old friend of his and to see a Nascar race.    2004  , this year started good.  had some hurdles to overcome at work, back to full duty, leg seemed good and the trip to Vegas was awesome.  good enough, my dad wants to go back next year and 2 of my brothers want to join us...i just hope i'll be able to do it.  things felt good.  couple relationships i had, they were wierd.  women thinks guys are assholes...there are a lot of twisted women out there too.  May, boss was an ass, i got pissed, that was dumb...they gave me 2 days off in June, no pay cause i work with a bunch of people that don't understand that people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.  then, May 27th.  i was heading to work, maybe doing 5-10 of the limit, nothing i didn't usually do.  actually i just started to slow down, maybe 45ish.  a woman driving a 2002 Lexus RS300 pulled out right in front of me, i had 15 feet till i hit her.  i drive a '99 Jeep Cherokee...it still isn't right after that.  i did succeed to tearing the front of her car right off.  she got the ticket, accepted full blame.  over 2 months later, shit is still fucked up.  my Jeep will have to go back for a day's worth of repairs.  as for me, well pain killers, muscle relaxers and restricted work hours, i'm still messed up.   so, do i let karma mess with me?  things good and bad, this life is still a fun trip.  besides, i beleive that karma atleast owes me some winning lottery numbers.  the only thing i can seem to win is a couple dollars...lol. wait, gotta check tonights numbers.......damn, didn't win again.  well, for a first posting, i believe i have started out good.  as for what "Eating Peanuts" means?  that will have to be another time.
