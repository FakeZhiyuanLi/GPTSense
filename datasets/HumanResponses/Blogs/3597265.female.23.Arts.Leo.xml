      I wish you knew how much I care/d for you, how much beauty I see inside you, how much I see that you can and will do for good -   and no, I'm not saying this because I have to, and no, I'm not saying this because I want you,  but I am saying that you're worth more than you know, you're more special than you realize,  and someday, someone who you'll be worth and will be worth you will see that, and know that, and love you forever...

      And an orator said, "Speak to us of Freedom."   And he answered:   At the city gate and by your fireside I have seen you prostrate yourself and worship your own freedom,   Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant and praise him though he slays them.   Ay, in the grove of the temple and in the shadow of the citadel I have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke and a handcuff.   And my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, and when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal and a fulfillment.   You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights without a want and a grief,   But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound.   And how shall you rise beyond your days and nights unless you break the chains which you at the dawn of your understanding have fastened around your noon hour?   In truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains, though its links glitter in the sun and dazzle the eyes.   And what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you may become free?   If it is an unjust law you would abolish, that law was written with your own hand upon your own forehead.   You cannot erase it by burning your law books nor by washing the foreheads of your judges, though you pour the sea upon them.   And if it is a despot you would dethrone, see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed.   For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a shame in their won pride?   And if it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you.   And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.   Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, the desired and the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished, the pursued and that which you would escape.   These things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling.   And when the shadow fades and is no more, the light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light.   And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom.

      Close your eyes - Close your eyes for just -  Close your eyes for just a second and imagine what life could be like  if   all the world stopped and you took in a single breath and considered yourself and others around you without   hate fear loathing pain history  what would happen?

      I fear, too early: for my mind misgives   Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,   Shall bitterly begin his fearful date   With this day's revels; and expire the term  Of talentless life, clos'd in my breast,   By some vile forfeit of untimely death:   But He that hath the steerage of my course   Direct my sail? Onward? Backward? Sideways?

      There are times I think you're untouchable, not even human.  But then I hear and see you cry and need and desire, and all I want to do is get you a blanket and a cup of hot cocoa and curl up with you in the corner, and feel safe with you in our warm space.  Maybe it's not so much that I want to curl up with you, but that I want to linger in a space that once was, and feel the sun rays of promise and possibility shining on my face again.  I miss the you of yesterday.

      I couldn't sleep last night.  Preoccupied with so many thoughts running through my head, it was all I could do stay in bed past 5 am.   But now that I've gone for a good run,  had a brilliant bowl of cereal and tried on all the fun clothes in my closet,  I think I'm starting to settle down again.    Oh, what I would give for a good hug today.  But hugging's against workplace policy, and all my friends have gone away.

      I feel as though my heart would burst and break from joy and pain.   So much to consider - my dreams are at my feet, my hopes are in the sky, and all I have to do is  take  a  deep breath    and     jump.

      I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry All I ever wanted was to love you, and make you feel loved, and cherished  Yet somehow I've dissapointed you  You say I'm not myself And I guess I'm wondering then If this is not who I am Then who am I and who do you think I am Because if this isn't me then I don't know where to go and I don't know who to be and I don't know what to do  Maybe who I am is not who you thought I was  Can you stand to see me change?

      I ask no favours for my sex. I surrender not our claim to equality.    All I ask of our brethren is that they will take their feet from off our necks.

      I'm finally learning to breath learning to think learning to be learning to become learning to belong learning to feel learning, finally, to live  Questioning my past and present I alone choose my future now my life is within my grasp my heart beats soundly within my body, fully-realized I realize I am free as I want to be Free to do  Free to desire Free to be Solely, unequivocally, unabashedly, unapologetically, unashamedly Me

      Ah, delicious indecision -  On the brink of seduction and solitude One touch away (away) from bursting with passionate agony Oh, I wish - Oh, I -   Oh...
