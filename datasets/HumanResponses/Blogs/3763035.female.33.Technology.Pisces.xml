       God...what a day.  I'm still tired from yesterday's yard work marathon prior to dinner last night.  I wake up hungry at 3am and can't get back to sleep.  I bit the hell out of my mouth, accidentally of course, during lunch.  And I had to deal with all the little issues this morning with the cry baby in the UK.  Geez, I just want a beer, a fan, and something good to watch.  Renee should be here soon, so I will be able to go home soon. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.  So, I've done my bit of complaining...thanks for reading, because I'm sure it is really boring.  As there was a three hour time delay since the first two paragraphs....I'm feeling better about life now that I've eaten and a couple beers down the hatch.  I'm looking forward to getting the three day weekend going on.  I know I'm enjoying the last days before we go back on the diet.  I will always enjoy the totally aweful food that is so bad for me....and will add to my hips and thighs....and make me totally ill to my stomach.  God, I remember when I use to enjoy these food and not feel ill.  I feel that something has been stolen now...gah.  Now, I'm on the search for a home gym and free weights...so that means I'm going to get into shape??  WHAT IS THE WORLD COMING TOO?!  At least I still have my beer and wine...for 5 more days.    So, this is me not whining....I really suck at it, don't I?  Don't worry....it always can get worse.

       What a stressful day.  I'm trying to not to let it get to me, but it's hard sometimes.  First, one of my servers crashes at 5:30am this morning.  Second, the UK guy, Greg, is out on vacation for two weeks starting today, so the asshole manager over there is calling me because we changed the domain admin passwords about a month ago. Third, the IT Director is taking Vicadin (or however you spell it) for a back injury and he's on the warpath of the mentally challenged.  All I want to do is learn out to install my new blade servers.  Gah.    Anyway, I'm getting over this whole work thing now.  I should be out ther mowing my lawn like my neighbor but I really don't like doing that sort of thing at this time of night.  I am enjoying my new computer desk...IKEA Rocks!...and I'm going to stay here until bed time.  God, what a geek am I?    I am so sore from doing that yoga yesterday and I only did 30 minutes of it.  Geez...imagine what would happen if I did the usual 1.5 hours in the class I was taking before I moved.  Ouch.   I need to go and call my Dad before I forget.  The wine is kicking in and it's not long before bed.  Now if the neighbor can pour some speed on his little legs, the lawn mowing may be done before now.  Same Bat Channel...who knows about the time tomorrow.

       Isn't it funny how you get what you wished for and it's not what you want?  I wanted a nice quiet weekend and that is what I got.  However, I got very restless and had to go do "things".  What sort of things?  Hmmm, go to Ikea and get a new computer desk, go to Sam's Club and get a crafting table and haul all this stuff home.  We also did the grocery shopping, laundry and took in a Nature Walk at the local atrium.  Today I just had to put together the new desk before 10:00am and then just tore up some cardboard sitting in the garage.  Geez, so much for relaxing.  I don't seem to get how to relax.  I did do Yoga this morning...does that count?    Anyway, I have many things at work that I'm wanting to get a jump on tomorrow morning.  I have these new servers just waiting for me to install them...it has all my Geekamones going.  I've been working towards getting my company to an Enterprise level of server architecture and it's hard to convince management to part with their money.  But I am one step closer with these new blade servers I had them get.  Now if they would only finish up the order so I can complete the Windows 2003 Active Directory upgrade.  I warned you that I was a geek.  ;-P  So, today is my mom's birthday and I lost her phone number.  She doesn't really seem to want to celebrate it so I just sent a card because that is what she said she wanted.  But right when I was going to look for the number, she called me.  Not about the Birthday mind you but about the diet both Renee and myself had been on.  We lost 35lbs a piece on the South Beach Diet.  I would recommend that diet because of the focused on low fat, heathly meats and veggies.  The low carb thing is rough on your ability to be regular, but it works on the weight loss.  So, we talked about that for a while.    The relationship between my Mother and myself goes like a Roller Coaster.  There are definitely ups and downs...and fast curves.  I don't believe that mom is very stable in the head but it took lots of therapy for me to realize how much I am like my mom.  I don't like that too much, but I'm working on it.  The latest thing was that I didn't talk to her for a year because she wanted me to go to a deprograming seminar for gays and Lesbians and telling me how Renee brings nothing to my life.  It took me a while to finally let it go and grow up a bit (master of understatement here...as you may or may not be able to tell).    That's about all today.  I'm finding that this is a nice venue for my thoughts and ramblings.  I use to be very faithful in writing in a journal, but I'm infront of a keyboard most the day and it is convenient to just logon and post something.  Maybe I'll get a reaction, maybe not.  Who really cares?  As long as I'm being true to me, that is all that matters.  Thanks for Reading...

       ..where the water buffalo roam...  My partner, Renee, and I have been together for three and half years.  We really didn't date because she said she didn't want too...So I had her move in within a month of meeting her in person.  We actually met after I moved to the Seattle area through her Ex-girlfriend.  I posted a personal ad to find a "Activity Partner" not a "Relationship Partner" and her Ex answered it. The reason why I posted it in the first place was because I was living with my Mother (big mistake) in Bremerton, and I was bored and so depressed.  There's isn't a large Out culture in Bremerton...To say the least.    Anyway, back the story....Renee's Ex-girlfriend (who she was still living with) answered and we started corresponding.  She gave me her home phone number and I called during the day and got Renee.  We talked for hours for several days.  Each time I called, Renee was home and her Ex wasn't.  After the second time, she asked me if I realized that her Ex was at work...I said of course and that I wanted to talk to her.  She has the most wonderful voice and really knows how to use it.  We read the same books, like many of the same things and connected on a very deep level.  I was falling for her over the phone.  We met in person with her Ex and one of my old friends at Gameworks.  She was so cute and shy.  We clicked in person as we did over the phone.  Within a month, I was able to find a job in Redmond and an apartment.  We moved in together and have been growing strong since.  She is my best friend, a wonderful lover and the center of my world.   As for kids, the only children we have is our two cats, Peanut and Fiona.  Peanut was originally Renee's but has become my cat when we all moved in together.  Fiona is the youngest that joined our family after my cat Bianca died.  Fiona likes my lap, but she favors Renee.    So, that's us in a nutshell.  I won't go into the drama of my family yet.  That will take another long entry that can only be confusing and cause many comments.

       Welcome to my site...this is the first time I'm doing this.  Now, my profile and description of the site is like a preview to the main event.  For those of you that went straight...or, ehm, forward, to this posting, I am a Lesbian Geekoid that tends to be a bit forward, a bit crazy, and a bit brilliant.  However, I do have my boring moments, so no worries, my life seems to be a magnet for drama, it'll get interesting again soon.  Because of that "drama" element, there may be a few pauses in my posting, but I will be faithful in my checking the email and the site.    Recent happenings is my partner, Renee, and myself bought our first house...Woo Hoo!  And we have been learning about the joys and fustrations of owning a house.  There are so many things needed!  A latter, hose, lawn mower...weed eater....and the list goes on. We tried to develop a list of projects that we wanted to do when we moved in and found that all the money has gone into getting tools and stuff to do the stuff we wanted to do when we moved in.  Gah.    So, this is not much of a beginning, but instead of overwhelming the masses with one long post, I'll try to break things up into chapters so y'all that don't care about what's going on at my work can just read what's going on at home.  Feedback is always welcome but flames will be ignored.    Enjoy...I'm looking forward to hearing from you guys.

       YEE HAW...the day is almost over.  And it's a three day weekend.  I'm so looking forward to getting out of here and relaxing...or attempt to relax for three days.  If the weather holds out, might even work on that tan that I don't have yet.  I am Geek shade of Pasty White.  Renee always says that I'm the whitest white woman that she knows and usually chases me around with Sun Block.  It really sucks because Renee is half Indian and tans when she's hit with a reflection.  But I usually don't do the tanning bit because my family has a history of skin cancer if exposed to it too much.  Besides, I just want my legs not to look like white sausage any more.  Great visual, eh?    Tonight is a repeat on American Chopper.  This so sucks.  Everything is a rerun except the movies and usually they are re-makes. And the Online game we play, Asheron's Call 2, is undergoing patching right now. Gah. Okay....I'm bored.  Maybe I'll break out my paints.  Haven't done that in a while.  Let y'all know how it turns out.  But YAY!  It's Friday.
