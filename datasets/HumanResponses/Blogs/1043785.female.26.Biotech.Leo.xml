      I'm in a pretty serious amount of pain, so I hope that this post makes at least some semblance of sense.  I get headaches.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; They seem to be happening more and more frequently, which is worrisome, and I realize that I should get them checked out.&nbsp; This is particularly true since they have an annoying tendency to progress into migraines.  Actually, the truth is that I get sick fairly often.&nbsp; As a result of this, I miss work more than most people do.&nbsp; I've been this way my entire life.&nbsp; I was frequently absent from school.&nbsp; Twice I ended up in the hospital with the flu.&nbsp; That's just the way I am.&nbsp; Maybe it's because I was never breastfed; I don't know.&nbsp; It's not like I can do a lot about it now.  Unfortunately, this is causing me some difficulties at work.&nbsp; My boss is unhappy with my attendance record, and while I can't blame him, at the same time, I'm not really sure what he wants me to do.&nbsp; As it is, I am already required to bring in a doctor's note every time I call in sick.&nbsp; I've been doing that, so he knows I'm not faking.&nbsp; Believe me, I'd much rather stay healthy and not have to worry about pissing him off.  What does he want from me?&nbsp; Am I supposed to wave a magic wand so that I'm never up all night, puking my guts out?&nbsp; Is there a magic pill I can take so I never again have debilitating migraines?&nbsp; If I could, I would.  Maybe this wouldn't be such a big deal if I was working to my fullest potential.&nbsp; I have to admit that I'm not.&nbsp; Part of that is my own fault, but part of it is a long struggle with depression.&nbsp; I've been battling it on and off for over 5 years now.&nbsp; I'm on medication, which seems to help, but it's not a perfect solution.  I've been at this job for over three and a half years now, and if I decided to pursue other options, it really wouldn't reflect badly on my resume.&nbsp; There's a part of me that wants to chuck it all, and start over somewhere with a clean slate.&nbsp; But at the same time, there's a part of me that wants to stick it out here until I feel I have succeeded.&nbsp; Naturally, that part is also the stubborn part which is resistant to change.&nbsp; I'm just not sure staying here is the best option for my mental health.  The whole situation really, really sucks.&nbsp; I live with the underlying fear that I could get fired.&nbsp; I've been trying to reassure myself that, even if I do get fired, it's not the end of the world.&nbsp; People get fired.&nbsp; They find new jobs.&nbsp; Life goes one.&nbsp; Still, that reality doesn't make the possibility more palatable.  Maybe I need therapy.

      Why do so many people in this world seem to have a grudge against directions?&nbsp; Whether it's asking how to get somewhere, or trying to figure out the blinking clock on the VCR, many people would rather try and fail repeatedly than ask for assistance and succeed.   I'm a female, which apparently makes me more open to asking for directions/assistance/whatever, but I'm also an engineer, which makes me prone to wanting to figure out things for myself.&nbsp; I'll admit, when it comes to electronics and appliances, I'll generally just start pushing buttons and playing around before I hunker down with the instruction manual.&nbsp; The point is, though, that if I can't complete the task in a timely fashion, I  do  use the instructions.   Habits such as these are only a minor annoyance in most cases.&nbsp; Maybe you spend twenty minutes extra in the car, driving in circles, or your guests point out that the VCR is still blinking.&nbsp; In the overall scheme of the world, these things are major tragedies.&nbsp; They're not even minor tragedies.   However, I work for a medical device manufacturer, and part of my job entails processing complaints from customers.&nbsp; It's truly frightening the sheer number of complaints that could be avoided in the doctors, nurses, or clinicians simply  read the instructions .&nbsp; Quite honestly, I find this rather frightening.&nbsp; I mean, if you were in the hospital, having some sort of device attached or implanted, wouldn't you like to think that the doctor, etc. was fully versed in the proper use/installation/placement of said device.&nbsp; Eesh.&nbsp; Scary.&nbsp; Fortunately, the lack of instruction-reading for our devices generally doesn't cause actual harm to the patient, just inconvenience and wasted time.&nbsp; But do you really want to bet that's the case all the time?&nbsp; I certainly don't.

      I know that I said this blog wasn't going to be about fandom, but I've decided that a thoughtful analysis of fandom and its implications is permissible.  &nbsp;  It's only been in the past five years that I have moved beyond being simply a television watcher, and advanced into an active member of fandom.&nbsp; This was caused primarily by my discovery of fanfic when I was a senior in college.&nbsp; Suddenly, here were all-new adventures about the characters I had known and loved for years, often in situations I would have been thrilled to see on the show.&nbsp; I soon began scouring the Internet for good stories, and eventually stumbled across message boards.&nbsp; Things have simply snowballed from there.&nbsp; I started writing and posting my own fanfic, branching out into a multitude of fandoms.&nbsp; I even helped create a fanfic archive.&nbsp; I became a regular poster on a variety of message boards, meeting and befriending all sorts of people along the way.&nbsp; TV has assumed a rather more important place in my life than it probably should have.  &nbsp;  That said, for all my ranting about horrible plot twists, revolting relationships, and cringeworthy characters on my favorite shows (let's not even get into premature cancellations), I have never forgotten that in the end, they  are  just television shows.&nbsp; If a show gets cancelled, or my favorite couple never gets together, I might be disappointed.&nbsp; I might even yell at the TV set.&nbsp; But in the long run, it won't have a very drastic effect on my life.  &nbsp;  I find it hysterical, therefore, to see such vitriol, such threats of violence, as people spew when they are angry over something like a piece of casting news.&nbsp; In the past week or so, there have been important announcements about two of my favorite shows,  Gilmore Girls  and  CSI .  &nbsp;  Regarding  Gilmore Girls , it was published in  TV Guide  that David Sutcliffe, who has appeared on the show several times as Rory's father, Christopher, will be returning to the show in season five for 7 episodes.  &nbsp;  Personally, I was thrilled.&nbsp; I enjoy David as an actor, and the character of Christopher lends an interesting dynamic to the Lorelai-Rory relationship.&nbsp; In addition, Christopher has also had interactions with Lorelai's parents, Emily and Richard, which is&nbsp;another intriguing layer.  &nbsp;  I was rather disappointed, therefore, to see so many posts at a particular message board ranting and raving about how horrible this news is, particularly with regard to the possible impact it will have on the burgeoning Luke/Lorelai relationship.&nbsp; People have threatened to stop watching the show if there is even a hint of romance between Lorelai and Christopher.&nbsp; Others have railed against series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, declaring that she has been leading them down the Luke/Lorelai path with subtext (and not-so-subtext) since the series began, and it would be wrong for her not to allow that couple to be together.&nbsp; Naturally, there have been several rather impassioned posts declaring what a jerk Christopher is.  &nbsp;  Christopher is a fictional character, folks.&nbsp; So are Luke and Lorelai.&nbsp; The goal of a television show is to make for compelling viewing.&nbsp; Happy, steady relationships have been shown time and again to be show-killers.&nbsp; While I'm by no means opposed to a Luke/Lorelai relationship in the long run, I also believe that watching them be schmoopy week after week, with no obstacles to overcome, would be intensely boring.&nbsp; Rory's-study-tree boring.  &nbsp;  And then today, the news broke that  CSI  stars Jorja Fox and George Eads had been fired from the hit drama, reportedly over salary disputes.  &nbsp;  According to many of the people at the aforementioned message board, this is a travesty, and blame rests squarely on the shoulders of Les Moonves, the head of CBS.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to matter that we probably only know a fraction of the story.&nbsp; It's all his fault, the actors are being victimized, and this must spell certain doom for the show.  &nbsp;  I don't pretend to know the reasons for the firings.&nbsp; Am I sad that characters I have been following for the past four years are gone?&nbsp; Sure.&nbsp; Will I stop watching the show?&nbsp; Hell no.&nbsp; In fact, without the ever-looming threat of a Grissom/Sara romance, I'll have less to worry about, but that's a story for another blog.&nbsp; The quality of the show depends largely on the writing, which needs to see an improvement from last year to keep me happy.&nbsp; I fully believe that new characters have the potential to be just as compelling, with just as must cast&nbsp;chemistry, as those portrayed by Jorja and George.&nbsp; In fact, given the destruction of Jorja's character last season, and George's lack of screen time, the injection of new blood with new stories might even make for better TV.  &nbsp;  It just amazes me how much to heart some people are taking this news.&nbsp; Repeat after me: They're. Just. TV. Shows.

      I don't think I'm a prejudiced person.  I don't care what color your skin is, what country you were born in, what religion you practice--or don't, or what your sexual orientation happens to be.  But there is one class of people that I absolutely cannot stand.  Stupid people.  And I'm not talking about people who haven't been given a chance to learn, or people who are mentally challenged (handicapped?  What's the PC term here?).  I'm talking about the people who have the common sense of your everyday doorknob.  And people who are both obnoxious and stupid are going to burn in a special hell all their own.  The speed limit is 45 and there's no traffic?  Don't go 35, moron.  The turn arrow switches to yellow and you're still 20 yards from the intersection?  Don't speed up and take the turn in front of oncoming traffic just because you feel entitled, you self-absorbed ass.  Don't know what you want for lunch yet?  Don't cut me off to get into the drive-through lane first, and then sit there reading the menu for five minutes.  Please don't pronounce "Italian," "Eye-talian."  It's not like they're from Eye-taly.  And it's "supposedly," not "supposably."  Don't "aks" me a question.  There are differences between your and you're; two, too, and to; there, their, and they're; its and it's.  Learn them.  Live them.  Love them.  And if you're a stupid person  stay the hell away from the airport self-check in kiosks .  I only have two hours before my flight.  I don't have time for people like you.  The same goes for grocery store self check-outs.  And finally, for the love of God, if you have more than 10 (or 15, whatever) items, stay away from my express lane!

      Bridesmaid dresses are, by tradition, pretty heinous garments.  I've been a bridesmaid four times so far.  Yeah, I'm pretty much  never  going to get married.  Anyway, up until last summer, I had really been pretty fortunate in the dress department.  That all changed last August.  The dress was red.   Really  red.  And it was strapless.  And it was 90+ degrees out.  Just to make things a little bit more fun, the wedding, which happened to occur on my birthday, was  dry .  As in, no alcohol.  And did I mention that the groom and I had a, shall we say,  complicated  relationship in the summer of 2000?  I didn't want to be in the wedding, and I sure as heck didn't want to wear that dress.  Ugly thing wasn't cheap, either.  Over $200 dollars for what was basically a tube of satin.  Bastards.  But that fiasco proved something to me.  Even the biggest fiasco can have its benefits.  This is especially true when most of the wedding party brings their own booze and drinks in the parking lot.   Classy .  In a true case of making lemons from lemonade, however, it turned out that the wretched dress was the  exact same color  as my kick-ass sleeper sofa.  Can you say "throw pillows"?

      This blog was inspired by the one and only  Ash ; more specifically, her new weekly humor column,  urlLink  21 and Invincible  .  Although that is the impetus for this, my particular seed sprouted in a completely different direction.  Generally, I gush about fandom and other light subjects at  urlLink my blog  and  urlLink my LJ , with the occasional "real life" post thrown in for good measure.  Here, I will primarily be housing my more abstract ideas, whether it is a philosophical musing on the creation of the spork, or a rant about the disciplinary habits--or lack thereof--of parents today.  So stay tuned, and enjoy the ride!

      This isn't going to be a happy post, so fair warning in that regard.  Nearly five years ago, my dad was diagnosed as bipolar. He had been depressed for many years, and never done anything about it. Finally, he went to the doctor and started on anti-depressants. Unfortunately, because he was actually bipolar and not simply depressed, this caused him to enter a manic state. In a very short time, my rational, logical, engineer of a father transformed into a person I didn't know. It was a horrible period in our lives, exacerbated by my own battle with depression. I won't go into details, because that would take too long and hurt too much. The Cliff's Notes version is that he was placed in the psychiatric unit of the hospital twice (once in November, again in December)--once voluntarily and once involuntarily. After his second release (due to some very frustrating state mental health laws), he was still unstable, and was verbally abusive to my mother. We ended up having to get a temporary restraining order. We allowed it to lapse after two weeks, and he moved back in. He'd been on medical leave from work for three months at that point. Long story short, he slowly began to respond to the medication, and returned to work in March. By May he had pretty much gotten as stable as he was going to get, and he has remained that way ever since.  We've been very fortunate that the medication has done its job, and he's not really cycled at all. Sometimes I think he got well through my mother's and my sheer force of will. That's not to say it was an easy experience, of course, but many people with bipolar disorder are never truly stable. Those that do become stable rarely accomplish it in a mere 6 months.   Although it was very traumatic, and there is still the underlying fear that it could happen again, for the most part we have moved on with our lives.  Unfortunately, not everyone is so lucky.  A while back, we learned that my dad's cousin's husband (did you follow that?) is also bipolar.  I haven't been privy to all of the details, but obviously it has been hard on both him and his wife.  I'm sure it wasn't easy for their son and daughter-in-law, either, who recently moved back to MI from AZ, where my dad's cousin lives.  I learned yesterday that the cousin's husband (we'll call him R), is still not doing well at all, and my dad's cousin (we'll call her M) has decided that at this point, they should not be living together.  This is a situation that my mother and I went through, and it's horrible.  Suddenly, the person you've known forever is gone, and replaced by a stranger.  My mom gave M a call, wanting to lend her support, and she learned that R had told M he was going to divorce her.  Again, this was something we experienced, and fortunately, it didn't happen.  But it is devastating for M, and my heart goes out to her.   To make matters worse, M suspects that her daughter-in-law, J, might also be bipolar.  Because of this, her son, B, is currently living with his aunt and uncle, while J, along with their 15-month-old daughter, live at home.  I can only imagine the pain B is experiencing.  He's long been my favorite relative, and even more than his mother's situation, I can relate to what he is going through.  I can't even begin to fathom, though, what it must be like to deal with this illness on two fronts--both a parent and a spouse.  Before my father was diagnosed, I had never known a single person with bipolar disorder.  In the past five years, though, I've learned of a startling number of people who suffer from it.  I don't know if it's because I simply wasn't that aware of it, or if it's because there is less of a stigma these days when it comes to mental illness.  A part of me would like to think that, because I am willing to talk about my experiences, others are willing to confide in me.  Mental illness is such a serious issue, and it's not something that can be callously labeled as craziness, or magically cured after a few therapy sessions.  In so many instances, it's caused by a chemical imbalance.  I can only hope that as time goes by, and we come to understand the brain better, identification and treatment of these illnesses will become faster and easier.
