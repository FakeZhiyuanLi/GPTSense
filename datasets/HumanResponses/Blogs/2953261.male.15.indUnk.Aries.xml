      Is it just me, or does the school population seem to be getting more and more stupid? As ost of you know, I'm friends with a lot of groups of kids, and they all seem to be oblivious to each other. A few days ago, two groups sat at the same table, and one moved away from the other, because they didn't like that the other was takingup too much room. They could have asked them to move, but no.They just moved away, and left me completly torn between the two. What is up with these people. Why cant they just all tolerate each other. I suppose though, if that were possible, we wouldn't be the most hated country in the world. Oh and for those of  you who think that I neglect my blog, let it be known that i plan to update more often, i have been busy lately, and i will soon have haloscan.

      Attention all students and teachers. Ya, well this is my blog link to the class blog for honors 9. Ummm ya. Wow don't those annoncements suck? Right in the middle of the good part of Cyrano. I think if they choose to interrupt class with a stupid announcement they should at least let Troy make it funny. Any way, I don't have all that much to say at the moment, I just figured I'd put something for you all to read on here. So, further bulletins as event warrant. Thank you and have a nice day.

      Well, here we are again. I'm writing in my blog listening to my headphones which help my concentration immensely (go figure). You are reading this random drivel. Drivel. Is that how you spell it? That has to be one of the wierdest words in the dictionary. Drivel reminds me of the word drool. Drool. heheheheh. There's another funny word. Yet another funny word, is cuckold, and shuttlecock, and masticate, and angina. Hahahaha. I'm so FUNNY!!! Not really. Now I'm going to get to the entertainment. You know, the real "meat" of this writing. Oh by the way, those of you who think I'm, like, SUCH,    a perv, when we read As You Like It, Wonderwizard said it is normal to get somewhat of a dirty mind while reading literature. Any way, now for the point. That is such a stupid saying, is it not? it sounds like someone is about to stab you on a late night talk show, or the news. "And now for the point (cue phyco music), now back to Ken for the weather."   Anyway, what else is new... I FINALLY got a job at the speedway. Now The Spanish Officer has a wad of dough. Who decided to call money dough. No one should call it "dough" anymore. In the thirties if you rob a bank I suppose one could have said " gimmee ooll the dough shee. I'll shlishe ya in half wit my tammy gan."  If some thug said that today... It would sound like an NBA star raised by a pack of wild mobsters. Hand over the dough, you punk bitch. I'll bust a cap in your ever lovin ass, you mugs. anyway, i cant talk anymore. Im being overcome by other duties. Later days.

      Hi. It's me again. I'm just stiing here in the library. I should be in my 3rd period science class, but we are doing prestantations on an assignment designed to keep our heads pointed at our desks, which most people didn't even take the time to put together in a logical fashion, so i dont feel guilty. Have you ever heard the Ramones song, "I wanna be sedated?" That is kind of how i feel. I can either wait in here for another half hour, go back to class, and be bored out of my mind, or go to a lunch where there is next to no one thati know. To make matters worse, my cd player ran out of batteries (because i listen to it 24/7). So not only do I have nothing to do, i have nothing to make having nothing to do tolerable. (does that make sense?). Any way, Im going to write randomly for a few more minutes, andthen i will go to lunch, aand then i will come back to the library and type randomly some more. sigh..   The librarian just yelled at me because she thought i wass writing an e-mail.darn. Now i feel like i totally made her feel stupid, and probably guilty for disturbing my writing. Wow. i still have a long time left. And now going to lunch isn't an option. oh look, it's Dave Weaver. maybe he will talk to me for a while to ease my boredom. Darn, now i dontsee him. oh well. Have you ever had that feeling, where you really wantsomething, and you think you might be able to get it, but you aren't sure, and there is something else just as good, that you know you can get, but you want the onbe you aren't sure of just because you feel like ut? I hate that. I know that im not being logical, but im doing it any way. Right now, im totally just letting my thughts drift, and typing them. this is a pretty fun way to think. now you all get some insight in to my mind. Un fortunatly, i get some really good idseas, but i forget them before i can type it. i think much faster than i type. The kid next to me is looking at me like im crazy, because i haven't stopped typing for about ten minutes. my finger are starting to get a litle tiered. who is that that just came in, wow that looks just like that girl from terminator three. hey, how is she meltng like that? oh no, look at the size of those guns! ahhhhhhhh! just kiding, as im sure you'vce guessed. hehehe. wow, i think that this will be my longest entry yet. i suppose because it is the most engrossing thing in the library for the moment. how pathtic for the library. these computers dont have solitare on them. i f0und that out when i got on a few minutes ago. Holy crap! i hagve been typing for 20 straight minutes. no stopping or anyhting. i have 15 minutes left until i get to go to lunch. hey! troy! ehhh, i dont rea;ly feel like to talking to some one any more. any way. darn, i just had something really good to type, but i forgot it. oh well. wait i remember. darn, lost it. nope, back again. i wonder when the room on this thing will run out. there is a girl right next to me readng her friend her letter for her senior project. she has an annoying high pitched voice. wow. i have acyually written quite a bit so far. i wonder how big it will look on my page. i wonder if some one will kick me of the computer before i publish it.  yipee i have some battery life left! babybabybaby loco. babybabybaby mambo. last night emily and i had a conversation online that was entirely song lyrics. just going back and forth. that was a good one. i wish i could start my senior project right now. i guess they have to give me a letter for it. i would do such a good job on it. i bet that i could get into a few colleges right now, over lots of the senior class. Gross, erin and nathan are making out between the book shelves. ewwwwwwwwwww. i have ten minutes left. ok. im done with this for now. i will write mor later. probably meaning a few months. hahaha. im am so bad about updating this. any way. bye (cat)

      I'm soooooo sorry that I haven't been posting. I'm just a terrible human being. I had kind of a crappy day today. It was one of those days where you keep trying and trying to make it good, but you can't squeeze it out. It's one of those days, where you had to wear the shirt that fits a little funny, because all the other ones are dirty, and you took a shower, but you dont feel clean, and you feel pale and chubby, and your throat is sore and makes you cough, but not REALLY sore. You get the boat ready to go to the lake, but it starts raining. You spend all night making your bridge perfect, but it turns out to suck. You sleep late and miss your favorite period. You get the cd with that song you want, but all the other songs suck. You start asking that girl out, but chicken out at the last second. You try that trick you could do on your skate board yesterday, but can't do it today and you fall on your ass. You fall going up the stairs, you  forget your luch money and dont realize until the last second and the lunch lady yells at you. You have a test you know you did bad on. The handle on your bag breaks. That little muscle on your back won't stop twtching. You find the anti-depressants in your mom's purse. Ok. I have to stop now. Later.

      Thanks Morgen for the motivation to update this damn thing. Even though I never really get excited enough to put new posts up, I seem to think about this more during the school year. But when someone asks me to update this while&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;online, from now on, I'm going to do it. Unlesss I'm doing something that can't be dropped. Too many "s"s on that last unless. I'mm to lazy to wait for the cursor to get there though, so I'm just going to leave it and use it for a talking point. The great Elvin Jones died not long ago. About two months. I haven't posted for such a long time&nbsp;I didn't even think about it. He was the first drummer I went to see live. I actually went to see him especially at Jazz Alley in Seattle. He was among my favorite drummers, and I stumbled into his dressing room when&nbsp;I went to see him. He gave me a bottle of water out of his little fridge. We chatted in between his sets, and he was a really nice guy. During his second set, he looked at me while he was playing. I was right down front and he looked right at me, and pointed with&nbsp;one of his&nbsp;sticks and smiled. I was the most self aware moment I've evert had. It would be as if you were watching TV, and your favorite character jumped out and said "hey." I truly idolized Elvin, and now he's gone forever. I will never be able to go to another show of his, and ask if he remembers, of if I was one of many.
