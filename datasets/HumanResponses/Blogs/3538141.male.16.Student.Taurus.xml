      I have no idea how this actually works... can anyone read my posts?  I have enabled browsing or something like that.  I'm confused.  Oh well.  If you are reading this, and find any of my posts interesting, feel free to e-mail me at samuel.wilkin@westminster.org.uk  I did Kung Fu today.  Master Lee was away so Old Jon took it... that was very funny.  We did mainly forms and traditional stuff - Martial Arts can be either Traditional or Modern, or both.  Traditional styles involve mainly forms and workign on low stance-work, whereas a more modern style will focus more on the competition sparring or practical self-defence.  We practise both sparring and forms at our club, but the feel of it is distinctly traditional.  Stance-work, however, is not just to look pretty - they strengthen not only the muscles in the legs, but internally strengthen the bones and joints, producing similar results to Thai boxers kicking trees, without the bone cancer most Thai boxers develop by the time they are 30.  I have heard stories of men in China who practise traditional Kung Fu not as a sport, but as a way of life.  You get 70-year old men who look 50, and 90-year olds who can still run around.  This if nothing else is a reason to practise Traditional Martial Arts, as I have seen the life of a 90-year old through the eyes of my grandmother, and it is not pleasant.  Even the great majority of middle aged people in this country are overweight.  I simply could not live with myself not being in good shape - for me it is essential for my concentration and general happiness.  Perhaps all that will change in a few years, but I hope not.  I intend to live every minute of my life to the full.  What a cliche!  But by that I do not mean clubbing, drinking and smoking, as most people who say that mean, for that is only living the first portion of your life to the full.  I intend to enjoy my early years while still knowing that I am in good shape and have a good outlook on the future, so that old age will be something to enjoy as much as my youth.

      Revised Latin today, for my GCSE on Tuesday.  Involved reading Pliny.  His view of the chariot racing is interesting:  'So I wonder all the more that so many thousands of grown men so childishly desire repeatedly to see horses running and men standing in chariots.  And yet if the were attracted either by the speed of the horses of the skill of hte men, there would be some logic in it; in fact they support a piece of cloth, they adore a piece of cloth, and if in the race itself... this colour were to be transferred to that horse and vice versa, their enthusiasm and favour will transfer as well'  This piece has always struck me as very relevant to football (or soccer to you Americans) in modern England.  I have sat through too many physics lessons where the conversation soon turns to football, and then swiftly to argument.  An Arsenal supporter calls another guy an idiot for supporting Chelsea, on account of their being 'crap', and the Chelsea supporter swiftly ripostes by calling the other a retard.  These are supposed to be 16-year olds.  It has always struck me as unnecessary.  Now I am not averse to watching a good game, in any sport.  However, these people are having fierce arguments in support of clubs to which they have seemingly no relevant connection.  Normally they are not the 'local' club, rather the most local club that is near the top of the Premier League - Chelsea or Arsenal.  The other side of the argument is, of course, that a club is made by its supporters, and it couldn't get anywhere without them.  This I appreciate, but I do not agree that this is the case with glory supporters such as those of Chelsea and Arsenal.  Football seems to have ceased to be 'the beautiful game', and has become a sort of one-up-man-ship.

      Well, here is my first post.  I dunno what to say really.  So much to say, nothing that I can be bothered with.  Currently right in the middle of GCSEs.  As for next year, I still don't really know what to do.  I dropped history for GCSE, but now really regret it, want to take it up again, which my school offers.  I also want to do Maths, Spanish, French and Latin.  I can only do four, unless I do French out of block.  But I am boring you all with details.  University I dunno what to do either.  I would love to study Chinese, simply because I would want to go there and generally love the culture (and the kung fu!).  Also a very important place in terms of world politics etc.  Still, that is a dream, and I still do not know if i can realise it.  In a couple of years, my ambitions may have changed - I had completely different ambitions at different stages in my childhood, although this one seems more permanent.  I probably want to Cambridge University, although apparently SOAS in London is very good for Chinese.  I'm always doing this - right in the middle of my GCSE's and I'm dreaming of the future.  That is all for today, will probably post tomorrow. P.S.  For a pic of me, go to http://www.hotornot.com/r/?eid=OQESNMA&key=HJK where I'm pretending to be 18!  :P

      A couple of days ago I called my ex-gf.  I hadn't spoken to her in 2 months.  In fact, I never really phone any old acquaintances.  All my phone calls tend to be stricly 'business-like' e.g. 'are you training tonight' or 'do you want to go out to dinner' (ok, so not technically business, but they have a motive).  And so I ask myself why, when I am bored, do I not casually call friends?  I have thought of a few potential reasons:  1.  I have only just gone pay monthly.  Calling people used to be expensive.  If this is the sole reason, then within a few months I'll be calling people like there's no tomorrow.  2.  In this impersonal modern age, where texting and moreover IM have taken over, is it worth phoning people?  It seems to me that for casual chatting, IM is the way we go.  The problem is that my ex-gf has been very busy with one thing or another, and so hadn't been on msn.  But as soon as I phoned her, she said 'erm... why are you calling me?'  I didn't take this personally because we then went on to have an amicable conversation.  I did the same thing when picking up the phone yesterday from a friend of mine.  So do phone calls have to have a purpose, even between friends?  Yet how many hours do boyfriend/girlfriend spend on the phone?  Even good friends do not seem to do this.  And that brings me on to my third possibility:  3.  Am I being a pest, or will somebody get the wrong idea?  I've just found something about which I am quite insecure.  And I never knew it before.  I'm scared now.  But it has happened.  I think part of the thing about a phone call is that the timing is unpredictable, and the person on the receiving end has to take the call.  With a text, they can answer whenever, and on IM they are only online if they want to talk.  So I found myself the other day positively annoyed when even a good friend called at a bad moment.  So do people feel the same when I phone?  Is it not just easier to send them a text, or have casual conversation on IM?  And the real problem I had with phoning my ex-gf was this - would she get the wrong idea?  We had never spoken on the phone before we went out, for I asked her out the day after we met.  And our break-up was confused and disjointed.  And I called her a lot during that time, because I didn't want to lose her.  So if I called again, would she think that I still wasn't over her?  Something I must explain here.  She does not have an easy life at home, and I obviously still care about her so I didn't want to cause her any unnecessary stress.  By calling her, would she get the wrong idea and worry about me?  Was this why, at the start of the call, the awkward 'erm... why are you calling me?'  I handled the situation (I had pre-planned it) by saying 'it's kinda immature to just stop talking to someone after breaking up with them.  So here I am'.  We had a nice conversation, and I don't think she got the wrong idea.  And yet I was worried about this phone call beforehand, and I must still care about it to be blogging now.  4.  This one only just occurred to me.  I board in school during the week, in which time I am constantly among my friends.  I see too much of them.  And during the week I don't have a huge amount of time to call any other friends.  Is it that on the weekends, I like a bit of time to myself and my best friend from outside school (who I see every weekend anyway)?  Is it that I have so much social contact during school that I avoid it slightly outside?  Is the phone becoming more formal and less a part of our everyday lives?  Or is it just to do with me?

      This was my question in my English exam (Non-fiction, media and information): 'Describe your ideal school.'  For once I actually positively enjoyed an English paper because it gave me a chance to express my opinion (for that, read 'be excessively opinionated').  This is a cut-down version of what I wrote (it might seem a little bit controversial and weird... but that's just me).  I believe in a school where individuality is important, and the individual pupils' needs are catered for, so that they are each treated like adult human beings rather than simply being a horde of machines waiting to have the relevant syllabus programmed into them.  Teachers, too, should not have constant restrictions imposed upon them, but should be able to teach the aspects of their subject that they consider to be more interesting in addition to the syllabus, in order to cultivate further interest in higher education in their pupils.   Here, I had to avoid bitching about the syllabus, because this was a GCSE exam.  Instead, I wrote about how schools could best take advantage of the syllabus   Obviously not everyone is going to benefit from this extended teaching, and there are plenty of people who know from an early age that they do not like subjects which they nonetheless have to do.  For this reason I suggest that we are setted according to ability for every subject - because I believe that in general, the more we enjoy a particular subject the better at it we will be, and vice versa, because we are more willing to put in extra time, or listen in class to something which we find interesing.  Therefore those in the higher sets will generally be those most interested in the subject, and after covering the syllabus their teachers can go on to teach them more advanced and, for them, more interesting topics.  Meanwhile, in the lower sets, the teachers are sticking more religiously to the syllabus in order that the candidates get good grades in public examinations - which is likely to be the most important thing for them in a subject which they do not enjoy.  To make this work, I think there also needs to be open discussion between teacher and pupil as to which sets a pupil should be in and why, and a pupil can contribute his own opinion to this.  It must be made clear that there is no shame in being in a lower set, but it simply means that your specific needs are being catered for so that you can focus more on the subjects you do enjoy.  While I fully realise that some are born more intelligent than others, I also believe that there is a strong correlation between how much one enjoys a subject and how good one is at it; I therefore believe that in being setted for every subject pupils would be able to more fully realise their potential and enjoy themselves more at school.   As I said, a rather cut-down version, but it gets the point across.  As ever, comments will be gladly received

      My apologies for the jumbled nature of my post yesterday - it was scribble down in rather a hurry, a brain dump of sorts.  Still, I shall leave it as it is.  I got on to the subject of teenage rebellion, and think it's about time I clarified a few things about myself.  I am not superhuman/freak enough not to be having a teenage rebellion at all, rather I am fortunate in that it happened around the year 7 time (aged 11-12.)  I would frequently get very angry with various injustices that were being done to me by teachers etc. - and they were injustices as far as I can remember, just I over-reacted.  I'm not sure what prompted me to rebel so early, I think maybe a certain teacher.  I shall keep her nameless to preserve her and my dignity.  She was my form teacher, geography teacher and PE teacher.  And I didn't like her.  My mistake, however, was to make it quite clear to her that I didn't like her.  Bad move Sam, you should have swallowed that pride.  She then began to hate me, and of course in this hate-hate relationship we had to see each other several times a day, and she held all the power.  And so I was treated unfairly, and I got very angry, and the situation escalated to the point where I actually walked home from school one day because I couldn't face her lesson.  Things started to get better after that, and I've basically emerged on the other side since I came to this school.  The telling factor for me is that I actually live a happy life, as opposed to my constant anger and depression suring year 7.  Kung-fu has helped (Yes you  knew  it had to come in somewhere didn't you?), mainly in controlling my anger.  I still get mildly pissed off from time to time, but it takes a lot to anger me.  However, one time recently I was greatly angered, for the first time in a good few months, maybe even over a year.  I won't bore you with details, but the school was asking quite the most ridiculous thing I had ever heard.  They absolutely  insisted  that I play in a certain concert, on account of my being a music scholar, despite: 1.  I hadnt practised in 2 months 2.  I couldnt practise until the night of the concert because the instrument was being repaired. 3.  I hadnt gone through it with the accompanist at all. 4.  I had 5 1/2 hours of exams that day.  As a musician, I knew that this combination was potential for the most colossal fuck-up the world had ever seen.  Yet they made me do it.  As it was, it went rather well.  I got lucky.  But it still made me very angry.  My housemistress seemed to think it was teenage rebellion, which is the relevance of this topic.  It is not.  That is simply me.  Perhaps it is slightly immature, but I know that for the rest of my life if people force me to do such a ridiculous thing I am going to be angry at them.  She then went on to say that I should talk to people more if i have a difficulty.  I had told various relevant members of staff several times each that I did not want to play in this bloody concert.  And then she had the nerve to talk about me behind my back to the music teacher.  The hypocrisy got to me even more.  But further proof to myself that this was no longer teenage rebellion was that, as well as this anger being a rare event and reserved to very special occasions, I had also got over it sufficiently by the next morning to not let it affect my 4 exams.  Of course, I was still angry inside, as I still am now and will be for a fair while.  But I don't let it get to the surface.  Certainly at the time I showed my housemistress that I was angry with her, but it is easier for everyone if I now contain the annoyance in a small archive file in the back of my brain.  I will always remember it, but it no longer bothers me.  Forgiven, not forgetten I think is the phrase.  And so this is not teenage rebellion but my character itself.  I shall improve my character as much as I can, and try to be the best person that I can be, but I categorically refuse to change who I am, because I am proud of my identity.  My housemistress said at the time that I couldn't go behaving like this in 'the big wide world'.  How right she was, but at the same time I knew that in 'the big wide world' I could refuse to do such ridiculous things, indeed I very much doubt I would be confronted with anything of that nature.  And in 'the big wide world' people might respect my opinion and my decisions, and treat me like a fellow adult/human being, rather than just one of the faceless ranks who can play musical instruments, or whatever it may be.

      I had an interesting conversation yesterday on the way to the local Chinese takeaway, with Charlie, a good friend.  I then continued this dicussion with Giles (my roommate) the same night.  Peer pressure.  Here I am, in one of the more expensive public schools in the country, and supposedly the best.  So what role does peer pressure play?  Firstly, there is no active peer pressure for one to lose one's virginity, or to smoke, for example.  People are more intelligent than to do that.  But there is still a definate necessity with most people to appear 'cool'.  Being cool no longer involves smoking in our year group, thank God, and I have gone out with people who were smoking and I wasn't.  And it was fine.  Yet there seems to be a need to conform - we have a 'string-bag crew' at school, who obviously wear string bags and hang around and laugh at those who don't (not only not wearing string bags, who generally aren't 'cool').  But what is cool?  I know for a fact that there are different groups of 'cool' people each making the others out to be sad.  There are some who positively take pride in being uncool, maybe being a geek.  But I am neither cool nor a geek.  I tend to float around in the middle of it all, speaking to and befriending whoever I wish, regardless of social status.  As it turns out, most of my friends are at the 'uncool' end of the spectrum, because the more cool people do not wish to be seen with them, and me when I have become one of them.  Yet individually they are nice people.  I have had lengthy, deep conversations with some of these cool people on an individual basis, and I have enjoyed their company.  So why this change?  I put it down to two things.  Firstly, a desire to make more friends so that life is not boring.  So you like a guy, and you want to get in with his 'crew'.  So you adopt their mannersisms.  This is where the passive peer pressure comes in.  While these groups are not actively persuding people to do things they do not want to, they are nonetheless having an effect on people and influencing their decisions.  Secondly, I put it down to cowardice.  Plain, simple cowardice.  We all have a choice of who our friends are.  Some of us, including me I hope, choose our friends because of who they are, and we can get on with them and be honest, and be ourselves.  Some however, desire to get in with a cool group, and they will laugh along with everyone else at a less cool person, because deep down they are scared that they will be the next target.  I observed a few weeks ago someone taking the piss out of people with the strength of character to express themselves in an msn screen-name.  He said 'be yourself... comme tout le monde.'  This is utter bollocks.  Everyone is not being myself, they are being themselves.  But apparently being yourself is now being conformist.  And, no doubt sad.  It seems that people in these 'crews' do themselves want to be seen as rebellious, or different.  I felt deeply sorry for the guy with that screen-name.  The above is only my interpretation of certain people, and I appreciate that for many people this is not the case at all.  This is just my view of some, and I may even be wrong about them.  But this is how I see it.  Feel free to post comments opposing this argument.  I shall leave you with one thought:  Isn't rebelling the most conformist thing a teenager can do?

      Here I am, trying to revise for my Biology GCSE in 2 1/2 hours.  And I'm failing miserably.  At least I learnt it all last week.  It took a week to read and understand the GCSE Biology syllabus.  Ok, my teacher taught me genetics, but f*** all else.  And so I wonder why are GCSEs so regurgitative?  Take Physics, a subject which I quite enjoy.  Yet even the exam reuslts can be reduced to a simple formula:  Common sense + A few equations ----> A* grade in Physics.  The other sciences are not so easy - not only do you have to learn the facts, but the bullshit that goes with them i.e. the way of expressing them.  But once again, I'm sure it could be done by a monkey if he could be arsed enough.  This regurgitative exam-style has even made it to Latin, a subject which I really enjoy.  Simply learn the translation of a Virgil or Pliny passage, and a load of bull that goes with it.  Fortunately, I myself quite enjoy reading them for their content (see previous post about Pliny on football).  But I could quite understand if someone were to hate Latin with a passion.  The same spirit, I am sorry to say has the tips of its slimy tentacles clasped around the edges of my favourite subject - Spanish.  Because we can made educated guesses at the content of the writing paper, we learn 'formulae' in the language, impressive constructions for specific situations.  Fortunately I can't see how those tentacles can get much more than a weak nominal grip on Spanish in the near future, Spanish being a subject without coursework.  My maths teacher described coursework as 'a series of hoops through which we must jump'.  She hit the nail right on the head.  It is quite so ridiculously easy to cheat, and it seems the more hours you put into it the easier it will be.  Now how about a GCSE for which there is no coursework, for which it is almost impossible to revise, so the only preparation a candidate gets for it is in the exam room itself.  Let us call it, for argument's sake, Intelligence GCSE.  Now I know that intelligence is impossible to define, so an Intelligence GCSE would be impossible.  I am simply using it as an example.  What if all GCSEs were to move a bit more towards intelligence, and away form regurgitaion: not all the way, as the ability to work hard is a virtue and should equally be rewarded.  But employers and universities themselves are saying that it is hard to differentiate between A grade students.  Oxford and Cambridge themselves give us tests at entry, which are very difficult to prepare for (although we will try!).  An Intelligence A-level then.  Good.

      I went to watch my sister at Tae Kwon Do today.  That's right, Tae Kwon Do.  The Dark side.  She left the Kung Fu club after only a couple of weeks for two reasons: firstly she couldn't understand a word my Chinese sifu was saying, secondly her friends were doing Tae Kwon Do.  I hope that one day she will come back to Kung Fu.  But anyway, I saw this class today, and I was truly shocked.  A huge class in a small gym, performing pathetic little movements with instructors beaming at them.  All the techniques are done with no contact, and once when very light accidental contact was made (due to a lack of control) the Black Tag (one away from Black Belt) at the receiving end doubled up.  How would he fare on the street?  And he was one of the better members of the class.  But the real reason I hate Tae Kwon Do so much is that it pretends to be something that it isn't.  Take something like Tae Bo - it throws in a few martial arts, but its main aim is fitness, most like an aerobics class.  Yet reading the information that the TKD club gives out, it claims to teach people 'superbly effective sefl defense.'  For a great number of reasons, with which I won't bore you non-MAers, I could tell that this was not the case.  In a street fight, they would try to use over-complicated, ineffective techniques that would simply anger a potential attacker more angry and lead to the TKD practitioner getting hurt.  So what does this club do?  Churns out over-confident people, giving out higher belts to anyone who has been going on for long enough.  Sure, the overcrowded classes bring in the cash.  I'm sure they bring in a lot of cash, which is why TAGB is the largest Martial Arts organisation in Britain.  It offers something for all the family, under the pretence of teaching them to defend themselves, whereas in fact with the confidence boost it gives them probably only endangers them more.  There is a lot more I can bitch about, such as the discipline in the class and the ability of their master, but I'm sure it would only bore you.  Do Kung Fu everyone.

      What is society coming to?  I've just been out on my bike and, on stopping at the lights, I had a car pull up to me and two boys hurl random abuse at me.  I have no idea of their motive, I can only imagine that because I was on an expensive bike they saw me as a rich bitch, which I suppose to some extent is true.  They were both younger than me, but unfortunately they were in a car, so I assumed there had to be a driver, who I couldn't see.  It was unlikely that a parent would allow such behaviour, so I assumed it was an older brother.  The only reason I didn't give them all a knuckle sandwich was the situation I was in - at the traffic lights, one of me, three of them, one probably older, and on my bike which one of them could easily have stolen in any fight that may have ensued.  So anyway, having thus assessed the situation I decided there was nothing for it but to sit there for a long few seconds, having abuse and saliva hurled at me until the lights changed.  I now wished I'd hit the little bastards.  But it was probably better that I didn't.  Grrrr.  If I ever run into them again, when not in such an awkward situation, I won't hesitate.  The thing that annoyed me most was the motive.  'Look!  A rich kid!  Wow look at his bike I'm really fucking jealous.  I know!  Lets call him names and spit on him!  That'll make it all better!'  Little shits.

      I watched the second England game of Euro 2004 today.  And once again I didn't cheer at our goals, groan at the worse moments.  In fact, I must be one of the few people who cheers and groans more at the news than at the footy.  Well, who can blame me?  England-France is  sooooo  last millenium!  The real match these days is England-Iraq.  Does America represent Sven, or am I getting pseudo-deep?   A disclaimer - I am not being remotely serious.  Anyone who takes this seriously is Wayne Rooney

          M     Misunderstood       R     Revolutionary       _            J     Judicial       U     Unusual       M     Mystical       S     Spiritual       Name / Username:       urlLink Name Acronym Generator  From  urlLink Go-Quiz.com   I hauled this off a website specifically designed for blogging.  And, for the most part it seems true.  I AM misunderstood, I most certainly am revolutionary, and unusual, mystical and spiritual as well.  I don't know about judicial - am I guys?  What luck.  I typed in another name and it came up with both normal and odd.  Some astrology, however, can outwardly appear very true.  Take my Chinese Zodiac - I was born in the year of the Dragon, and show many of the traits assciated with it.  I also, however, show most of the traits of the snake and tiger, and some of those of the monkey.  And this seems to be what astrology is based upon - make enough generalisations and you are likely to be right for a fair proportion of people.  But the Chinese Zodiac works on a yearly basis - are half the people in my year group at school also going to posess the traits of the Dragon?  I don't think so.  The monthly Zodiac might be more convincing, if it weren't for the fact that I show none of the traits at all posessed by my sign, the taurus.  But is astrology and supserstition utterly useless?  No, I don't think so.  The advice given in horoscopes, or anything of that nature, is always generalised, and every time I read the horoscope section in the Metro (which isn't that often at all), I can identify with any of the star signs.  But while the astrologers can make their advice fit anybody, we too can mould their advice to our needs, and I find that if I have no other option in an important decision I can go and read a horoscope and read what I will from what is there.  That way I try to forget that it is all essentially bollocks, and gain some confidance in whatever decision I am making by the advice it gives me.  That was the daily advice.  But what about having your character defined by what year/month you were born in?  No real use, but good for an ego-trip.

      I think I have low blood pressure.  I can train for 2 hours solid, yet the first second or so when I stand up after lying down I feel dizzy.  Apparently it can be to do with the heat.  Time to start a diet high in sugar, salt and water - apparently that's the best way to deal with it.  Better than going to a doctor anyway.  I hate doctors.  I absolutely hate them (btw the previous bit was not just made up to go on a rant about doctors, I genuinely do think I have low blood pressure).  They seem to be utterly useless.  When I completely fucked up my leg a while ago I had to go to a doctor (torn muscle, put me out for 3 weeks).  Did she give me a crutch to help me walk?  Hell, no.  She just overprescribed Neurofen.  I didn't need painkillers, because I could handle the pain.  I didn't even need paracetemol.  (Apparently Neurofen is a muscle relaxant as well - that would have been useful.  Couldn't she have given me the muscle relaxant without the painkiller?)  So anyway, a crutch would have been really nice.  But no, just prescribe painkillers for everything.  Oh well, I did go and collect the prescribed Neurofen for the hell of it, so I now have an unused box of it ready to sell on the black market.  Anyone want it?  And similarly, if I go to a doctor now and say I have slighly low blood pressure (because it is really a minor thing, it only occurs when I first stand up after a long period of lying down; I don't randomly faint) they're probably going to prescribe something like heroin to get my heart beating faster again... no thanks.  I'll stick to self-diagnosis with the help of friends and the internet until something serious happens.  In fact, on a complete tangent, something weird did happen the other day.  I found a tiny little thing under the skin on my leg.  Only about the size of the full stop.  I very un-surgically removed it with my pen-knife.  It was black, and looked much like a tiny pebble.  But it was soft.  Very weird, thought at the time it might be a cancer or something.  Still, it hasn't come back.  Me and my penknife: 1, Doctors: 0.  :D  Screw them.

      For once I am going to post about myself.  I have just finished my GCSEs.  And I'm happy.  There you go.  YAY!  WOOHOO!  At last all that regurgitative bullshit is over.  8 weeks off, and then A-levels, where I can do only the subjects that I enjoy.  There will, unfortunately be some subjects that I miss.  There are 7 A-levels that I would like to do: Maths, Further Maths, French, Spanish, Latin, History and Physics.  I'm hoping to get 5 in there.  So there will be some subjects that I will be sorry to see the back of.  But there will be some subjects that I will not be.  Least missed subject?  English.  Hands down.  Shall I go on a rant about why we have to have not one, but two core English GCSEs, when the subject is full to the brim of bullshit anyway?  No, I shall resist, but suffice to say that I think English as a core subject is a waste of time and space, and I'd much rather have something like French as a core subject.  After all, being able to speak French is useful in life unless you're one of those xenophobic fuckwits who thinks that the only thing you need to do to get by in France is 'point and raise your voice'.  Well that might even be true, but businesses also have a much greater use for French than English Lit.  Irrelevant subjects is what annoy me.  Take chemistry.  It has potential to be a very useful subject, and I'm sure it is at higher levels, yet at GCSE they tell us how iron and steel are made.  Yes, because Britain is still a great industrial nation.  Keep telling yourselves that.  And the videos they show us at the end of term in chemistry... the biology and physics ones are scientifically fascinating, and might give someone keen on the subject some real ambition to continue it.  Not so with chemistry.  Physicists make rockets and go to space.  Biologists study the human genome.  Chemists grow long straggly beards and sit around in obsolete factories all day, looking at bits of steel and throwing potassium into the boilers in their lunch breaks (I'm not joking...)  I reckon you'd make more money out of the steel industy by learning Taiwanese than by learning chemistry.  And it would probably be more fun.  But anyway I'm ranting, and I said I wouldn't, so sorry about that.  And just in case you'd forgotten: EXAMS ARE OVER! YAY! WOOHOO!  My god I'm happy.

      I read today that the Swiss referee, who disallowed the England goal, has received multiple death threats.  Ok, he cocked up a decision, no questions about it.  It was a big cock up too: disallowing a goal comes right alongside giving penalties as 'things not to do unless you are absolutely bloody certain'.  But death threats?!  IT'S A GAME  So is tennis.  The Sun's headline was worrying.  'Guilty', with mugshots of Henman, Beckham and a couple of others (I think representatives of the cricket and rugby teams).  Guilty of what?  Guilty of being the best we have, or had.  When The Sun finally realises that Henman is not going to win Wimbledon, and England is not going to win Euro 2004, they need to blame someone.  The referee was easy and even justified.  But that didn't go far enough.  So, they attack the players who they have over-hyped the most.  By putting all the pressure on them, and making the nation believe that they really can win, they do not just say that they made a good effort but were beaten by a better team/man.  They have to come up with headlines like 'guilty'.  Apparently Beckham isn't up to it now, it's his fault that we lost.  Hang on, wouldn't we have won without that dodgy decision?  So surely Beckham is up to it?  And what about Rooney?  When he went off injured, the commentator said something along the lines of England being screwed.  Sorry to be blunt, but if the team is relying on a single 18-year-old to win, I'm afraid the team isn't really up to it.

      I am now even more ecstatically happy than before.  I found a holiday job, it pays well and I can work all the hours I want.  Oh, and yesterday also heralded the best Kung Fu lesson I can remember.  Life is sweet, apart from my fear that the better life gets the further it has to fall... but I won't think about that.  Even better, the guy I'm working for has a thing for Jaffa cakes, and his wife makes great tuna sandwiches... so I'm never short of a bite to eat either.  Bad things - well I suppose part of my job involves calling people from a list and asking if they would be interested in our services.  I can't remember the technical name for it, but fortunately I am not working for a double glazing salesman, and the list of people to call is quite specialised, so I get a positive response on about 1/2 the people I call; still the other half's responses aren't always pleasant.  Next time a double glazing salesman calls, think twice about telling him that 'I doubt I've got the same number as somebody else' (NONONO what I meant was that his number was listed twice) or alternatively spelling out your whole address in the phonetic alphabet (alpha bravo charlie etc) just because he didn't hear it the first time.  Then again, they  are  double glazing salesmen aren't they... use your judgement.

      Not only has my comment been accepted by BBC News online, but it has got one of the cool quotey things AND it's the last one before the debate closed.  Hurrah!  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/3878829.stm

      Got my school report back yesterday.  It was the best I had ever got - even the English teacher had nice things to say about me.  The only exception was the trombone teacher... well I suppose it was to be expected because I hadn't turned up to a single one of his lessons.  The problem is, I don't see how this is going to improve.  I havn't been able to practise at all over the holidays because of doing Kung-Fu once or twice a day.  And I'm hardly going to be able to practise when I get back if I'm going to be doing 5 A-levels.  So what to do?  If I were to stop lessons the school would be able to take away my music scholarship.  This wouldn't be a problem because all it does for me is to pay my tuition fees - the school fees are already reduced from the Academic scholarship.  In fact, taking away the music scholarship would be singularly bad for the school because I would no longer be obliged to be part of the orchestra, and my role in it is essential.  So let's weigh up the pros and cons of letting it go:  Pros: 1.  I would not have to attend lessons, which will be very difficult next year. 2.  I wouldn't have to practise. 3.  I would not be obliged to be in the orchestra. 4.  There would be no repeat of what happened at the house concert this year.  Cons: 1.  I don't practise anyway. 2.  1/2 hour committment per week isn't much. 3.  Next year in the orchestra I will play first, it might get a bit more interesting. 4.  If I give up, I stand very little chance of becoming head of house; as it is my chances are qutie good.  What to do?

      I am so busy these holidays.  My Monday-Friday routine looks like this:  7:45-8:00  Get up 8:00-8:45  Train 8:45-9:15  Shower, Breakfast 9:30-5:30  Work  Then eat, and train for another 1-2 hours.  Saturday morning is reserved for sleeping, the afternoon for training and I can socialise in the evening.  And Sundays are currently crammed full with socialising.  Speaking of which, Li earned the Sam Wilkin Quote of the Week on Sunday, with 'Giles... doesn't have tiger written all over him' (I  told  you I'd post it Li).  As a result of all this, I'm bloody knackered.  I've just got to keep thinking of the money from work and the benefits of training twice a day.  Still, work isn't so bad... I'va laready mentioned the abundance of Jaffa cakes at work, and quite often the boss is out, leaving me alone to take payed breaks playing games on my mobile phone.  Still nowhere to sleep though.  The really annoying thing is that when I get home I no longer feel tired.  Very confusing.  But the 3pm slump really hits me hard.  Anyway, I've had the morning off to collect the Spanish Prize at school on the last formal day, but I need to get to work now.  Let;s try to stay awake.

      Work today - payday :D.&nbsp; Went pretty well, although I think I'm just beginning to see what the Chinese are on about when they talk aobut Feng Shui.&nbsp; As soon as I walk into the dark, cluttered study, with about 3 phones ringing at once, I feel stressed.&nbsp; It can't be good for me, I'm getting through a disproportionate amount of muffins.&nbsp; This is not good as my Kung Fu grading is on Sunday.&nbsp; It's the last one before the black belt, and my god is it going to be hard.&nbsp; Ideally, I would have had a little longer to learn my form, but with holidays coming up, and then back to school to do 5 A-levels in September, my fitness wouldn't be up to it.&nbsp; So I'm throwing myself in at the deep end.&nbsp; With muffins in me.&nbsp; In other news, I really really really want one of those Ferrari laptops.&nbsp; They look like Ferraris, go like Ferraris and are actually better value for money than the equivalent Sony, Dell or Toshiba.&nbsp; We'll see how much money I have at the end of the holidays...

      Sorry I have been away a while, I have been staying in the country with some friends, and am going to Barcelona next week with friends.  There were a couple of guys I was staying with last week who made me think: what is a geek?&nbsp; And what is a nerd?&nbsp; They were both rather nerdy, but what made them that way, and why did I define them as such?  It takes more than playing computer games to make one a geek.&nbsp; While I don't currently play any computer games, I'm sure I would if I had a better computer.&nbsp; But that doesn't make me a geek.&nbsp; No, I think that being a geek is a serious pasttime: building one's own computers, programming, and knowing how to run Linux (I only found out last week that it was an operating system; Giles if you laugh I'll just call you a geek :P).&nbsp; There is of course the famous definition that every nerd is either a pizza nerd or a coffee nerd - the pizza ones tend to be spotty, and occasionally fat, and the coffee ones wear glasses and are neurotic (am I generalising?&nbsp; No, of course not).  So I have a rough idea of what a geek or nerd is.&nbsp; But is there a difference between the two?&nbsp; I think a nerd tends to be more professional, a nerd is more likely to be a professional programmer than a geek, and while one might be able to become a geek if one spent  all  of one's time playing computer games, I don't think the same is true of a nerd.  But anyway, this is just my impression, and there will be much conflicting opinion.&nbsp; I welcome it!

      Yay!&nbsp; I just did my grading and it went really well, I am now only one grade away from my Black belt.&nbsp; NOTE (not quite a rant): getting a black belt in kung fu is bloody difficult, unlike tkd... &nbsp; Unfortunately the vicious little cunt I was sparring again kicked the side of my knee (illegal!) so now my tendon is buggered.&nbsp; :( oh well it should hopefully get better soon.

      I am seriously considering not going to work experience next week.  I'm not earning, not learning and have to put up with almost 3 hours of travelling every day.  In fact, the travelling isn't so bad - I avoid the rush hour and have a good book.  The infuriating thing is that I have quite literally spent 90% of my time either pissing about on the internet or doing paperwork (literally copying figures from a sheet onto a computer... fun!).  The only problem is that I have still got the security card that gets me anywhere in the building.  I guess I'll post it back - at least when I have received the cheque for last week's travel expenses (I wouldn't put it past her, I really wouldn't...)

      Next year I shall study Maths, Spanish, History, Latin and Express French.  Then I shall go to Cambridge University and learn Chinese.  Then I will join the Foreign Office, or the SIS if I'm feeling adventurous.  I don't care that it isn't particularly well paid.  So there.  I've finally come to some decisions.

      It seems all that Al-Qaeda has to do is to say the word, and all of America will descend into deep paranoia. I saw pictures on the news of what looks like Seal teams on the New York underground.  The question for me is this: where, if anywhere, will they strike. It could only really be Britain or America, but which?  Britain is the only country of the coalition which has not yet been hit by Al-Qaeda. Are we to be punished for our comparitive apathy? Certainly a terror attack on London would be easy to organise and quite catastrophic and, to be frank, it is our turn.  But on the other hand, Al-Qaeda could mock America's paranoia and hit her again. America is also more hated than Britain, since she is the main protagonist in the coalition, and Camp Delta still exists. Futhermore, the American GE in November could provide a specific motive for anyone wishing to worsen Bush's chances of a second term. That could work the other way as well though, and large numbers of Americans could unite behind him in a statement of patriotism and defiance of the terrorists. That would truly be the last thing the world needs.  On an entirely different note, I think the Americans are hugely overdoing the security. The fact is, if Al-Qaeda wants to attack, it will attack and no amount of special forces can stop a truck-bomb. It has simply served to turn the 'Land of the Free' into nothing of the sort. Of course, even under Democracy we can never have a free country. If we do not wish to pay our taxes, we go to jail. If we attack someone, we go to jail. If we disagree with our leaders, there is nothing we can do, and voting is hardly unanimous. The leader may only get in by a 48% majority, or even a 48% minority in the case of George W Bush. But let's not go there. The fact is a totally free nation would not be a good thing at all. In a state of anarchy, the world would simply not progress. But still, random stop-and-searches and overt special forces operations are going too far. America is answering to the call of Al-Qaeda.  I find myself thinking that fighting terrorism at all is futile. For all our armies, we cannot fight an enemy which we cannot see or contain. Perhaps the 'civilised' Western world could act civilised and try to seek peace. Forget all the cliches that it would be what the terrorists wanted - of course it is! I'm sure they would all prefer a world where they weren't attacking America, as long as America wasn't attacking them either. Ok, there are some inhuman monsters out there - on both sides - but a lot of the suicide bombers are simply those who have lost family to America's attacks, and are probably not entirely unreasonable. As it stands, America is quite rightly hated throughout the Muslim world, but if it did something to amend its reputation even the most extreme of extremists would be powerless without the support of the people. As long as the said fanatic is not in government, his power is from his followers and those willing to lay down their lives in honourable suicide for him. Few people would be willing to do such a thing without just cause. But for as long as Camp Delta stands, and America continues her Islam witch hunt, terrorism will exist. It will not go away on its own, nor can we overpower it.  Perhaps this is just a dream that will never be realised. Both sides may well have become far too proud to make concessions. But one thing to me is certain: if no concessions are made then this war will rage for at least the duration of my lifetime.

      First day today.  They are planning to put me at a different desk each day, so I can generally see what the company is about.  For the first of my ten days, I was put in Postal so I could learn my way around.  All that I actually learnt is that nobody does any work in postal, because there is so little to do.  Oh, and the Postal coordinator or whatever his title is, while being quite a nice guy, is a total Brent.  He even has the same smile, same laugh, same mannerisms as well as the same personality.  Perhaps it is true that there is a Brent in every office.

      Well, I did it.  It was harder than expected.  I walked into reception this morning, and I couldn't get a word in edgeways.  So I ended up at a desk.  This was worse than before.  I didn't even have my own computer, so I was just sat next to a guy, who was putting numbers into a computer and occasionally grunting at me what he was doing.  Oh, and telling me how boring his job was.  Like I didn't know.  Still, about an hour in, I made my excuses to him and the HR girl and left, chin up.  That's the way.  One thing I need to learn, though, is how to walk into an office, or wherever, and tell whoever it may be, in a most polite manner, that I don't like them, I don't like what they're doing and for that reason I'm going and not coming back.  It's a true art, I'm sure.

      I'll go in tomorrow morning.  That way I'm guaranteed to pick up my cheque, and I can hand back the security card.  Whether or not I do the rest of the week I can ponder on the train, or discuss when I get there.  To be honest, I don't think I will; I was expecting something rather different, perhaps being taught something interesting or being given some responsibility.  But perhaps that's too much to ask for an insignificant little 16-year old like me.  Age and qualifications matter so much.  Any qualification I get in the next 5 or 6 years would not help me with the business, and yet they don't trust me with anything.  I don't expect to funcion like a normal employee, because I havn't had the specific training, but I expect them to trust me, maybe even take an interest in what I have to say.  I can't name specifics, but I just wanted to be treated like an adult.  Nothing, and I mean nothing in this world infuriates me more than being treated like a child.  We saw that at the end of last term.  I may only be 16 years old, but I am an individual with my own opinions.  Patronising, that's what it is.  School, work experience, whatever.  Patronising.  Treat me like a teenager, expect me to act like one.  Expect me to be restless, easily bored and bad tempered.  Expect me to give up on things.  Don't expect me to sit in your beautifully furnished offices gawping about for 8 hours a day, dreaming about how when I grow up I'll work for your wonderful company.  Put me in a situation with nothing to lose, and I will happily go and lose nothing.  Why should i stay on next week?  For the sheer enjoyment of 5 more 10-hour days packed with thrilling nothingness?  I don't think so.  The only thing I lose by not going next week is possible future employment in the company.  And I decided earlier this week that I didn't want it thank you very much.  So I shall step aside, let some other poor lamb take my place or, if it is too late for that, relieve the lovely people at Man Group Plc of the burden that is me.  Because that is how they see me.  They are most happy when I am just sitting in the corner reading a book or the online news.  I can do that at home.  But at home I can also look at less reputable internet sites, get up later, practise kungfu, socialise.  This wonderful myriad of options.  As I have been so brutally reminded this week, I am still young.  I'm gonna enjoy it.
