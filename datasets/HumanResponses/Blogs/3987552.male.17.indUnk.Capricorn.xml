      Friday was the biggest waste of a day.  Where to start?  I guess in the beggining:  Woke up way to early.  And why? To go to school for 6 hours.  The mentor training was the gayest thing ever.  I have never done so much pointless "Team Building" in my life.  I have every school year when you have to meet your class mates and all that other stupid "Meeting you new friend" stuff.  When that was over, of course it would be raining.  I don't hate rain (even if i should) BUT I hate when it is bright and sunny and raining. When it rains, it should be dark.  After that I called 3 of my people; talked to one of them, talked to one parent, and talked to some guy that didn't know when he would be back.  But at least I tried.  Only 3 more calls to make.  Friday was the first day I actually wish I add been at work.  The rest of the day just kinda sucked.

      Yesterday was just so much fun.&nbsp; I got to help my cousin move.&nbsp; The only good thing about the day: her two kids weren't there.&nbsp; It wasn't that bad excepted in rained all day.&nbsp; Got to ride around hanging from the back of a uhaul.  Today I add to go get blood drawn, twice.&nbsp; I got to sit around the Methodist Medical place for 3 hours.&nbsp; I actually started the summer reading and it isn't that bad.&nbsp; Still probably wont finish it but the beginning isn't that bad.  Post a comment or you die.

      I still have a headache.&nbsp; I have had it since 5:00 tonight.&nbsp; Didn't do too much today, at least nothing worth writing about.&nbsp; About to go fall asleep.&nbsp; Hopefully I won't wake up for at least 12 hours.&nbsp; You call my cell tonight,&nbsp; you die.

        THE END IS NEAR!!!!! We are all going to die!!!!! SCHOOL IS STARTING!!!!!ONLY 12 HOURS LEFT!!!!!RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!!      Maybe. I can't believe how fast this summer has gone. In less than 12 hours, hell on earth will begin again.          This summer has been different. My grandpa had open heart surgery. I didn't see my mom much because she was always with him. It was kinda of nice. After work I would come home and listen to my music as loud as I wanted.          The End
