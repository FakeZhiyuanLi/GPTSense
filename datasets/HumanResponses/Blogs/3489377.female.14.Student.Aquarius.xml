        Ah! Back from Mississippi..Im tired, hot (the AC was just turned on), and well..bored. I can't wait to get my PS2 back tomorrow! I traded in my Game Cube, (soon to trade in these tomorrow) Gameboy Color, N 64, some controllers, and Xbox. My cousin spilled milk on our PS2 and we were pissed..(we=brother and I) I wanted to kill him. Hopefully I'll have enough store credit at Game Trader to get a PS2. I hope! I want to buy Final Fantasy XI and play with mah boyfriend, Terik. Speaking of Terik..I miss him. I haven't seen him in a couple of days. I'll be gone for a week starting on the 12th of June. His birthday is on the 24th, and my mommeh's is the 28th. Jeez...Too many. Lol. I don't know what to do now..Im just writing this and drawing on a spare sheet of paper I found. I feel like RPGing with someone. I have horrible memories witht hat though. I was fucking retarted because I cheated on my boyfriend with an internet guy. I wish I could take it all back. I hate myself for it everyday. I try to forget but. . .I know I fucked up real bad and would spend the rest of my life to make up for it. I do what I can for him. i try to do everything but im only human. I love him and I guess I didn't see that before. I love him now and I know I always will. Oh well. . .I miss him right now. God it's hot..*sweats*

      Well, my first blog. I figured I should do it sometime to try something new. I don't normally share my thoughts like this but, feh, I don't care. What should I talk about? Let's see if I can remember the things that I like...For my future reference... 1.My better half, Terik 2.My lack of art skills and such 3.My humor..Even though im getting better at it 4.Anime..Who can't say anime? 5.My video games, can't forget those 6.My writing abalities 7.My friends 8.My sense of creativity 9.Sometimes my smile 10.My eyes 11.My music 12.My evil side 13.My lacking computer skills.. Well, I think that is it. Oh well! Maybe when I read this when im older i'll kick myself in the ass for some things. I dunno. I am completely bored as it is. Im leaving to go to Mississippi soon. Just waiting on my mother to get off of work. My hands are cold..I am completely cold. *kicks the ac* It's cold..Anyway..I need to fix up my blog..

      Terik is playing FFXI and im sitting here bored and alone, listening to Sound of Snow Falling from Samurai X..It's my favorite song on there. My hair is frizzy and in the way..I always wonder if i'll be alright when I get older..I think about the people that I will lose and it makes me think even harder about what I would do. I want to play the flute..I know it must be hard. Maybe next year i'll join the highschool's band. I like the way it sounds..so peaceful and relaxing..Sort of sad, but happy too. I guess it depends on what your playing. I think about my art too. If I will keep doing it and be great at it..or just stop and forget. Im depressed sometimes because I start thinking about the future..Im scared and worried that things wont work out or something. *sighs* Im worried about my one true love walking out of my life and never seeing him again. I may be young, but when he is with me..it feels right. I feel at peace with myself and I think better of myself. I laugh and smile, like I did when I was just a small child. I lost my childhood at the age of 8. I can never have that feeling back, but I can feel better knowing that I can act as a child around him. Teenagers go through so many problems in those years of misunderstanding, not doing what other's tell you to do, not careing about some people that are close to you. You push them away and it hurts inside when you realize what you've done. Hurt and pain are some problems today..When we get upset, we think of oneself, we think that all of the bad things happen on only us. That isn't true..But anger is a very different feeling from others, yet they are related and share some sides. I know this is confusing, but not to me. I have learned from my mistakes and learned some wrong from right, but..Im still a child. I am still the small weakling that is in the far corner, hiding from the monster in the closet. Someone saved me from my fears, he is fighting for me and I hope I won't suffer anymore with the past that I had. I fucked up a lot in the past and maybe...maybe I can overcome all of that and be my self again. One day, we can all live in a world of peace..So we don't have to hide anymore..

      Sweat, tears, pain, and aches..Yep, they all equal up to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Flordia..I didn't smile but once. My bag was stolen in Universal Studios. I got it back but I was upset..I missed my Babe and I couldn't even call him..I was there for a week. I thought the food was bad..It was expensive too..$6.39 for a burger and fries. I could buy three burgers with that..The Fantasia Pool was horrible. It was cloudy and looked like ten million kids pissed in it. Yeah, I have the right to complain. I was happy when I could stay up late and walk to the food court for free drinks. I was alone to think about stuff. I wore "color" clothes because it was so hot..Oh well

      Yeah..It's Sunday night and there is nothing to do..Well, there is NEVER anything to do anyway..So I guess mah blog is okido for now. My cousin is over and he is leaving tomorrow morning. I don't ave any ideas for drawing something..I have the depressed feeling but nothing comes to mind right now..Maybe laters. No one to talk to..He is watching Tech T.V. because there is something about video games on. It's not X-Play, which I kind of wish it was...Adam and Morgan are always funny. Neopets is getting old again. Then that time of the month doesn't help either..*cramp* Oh well, maybe I can write some of my novel tonight. I need to find it first o.O Heh..It's a romance...Im so sappy. I can't help it though..Wish I had Samauri X, but it's at my boyfriend's house..Along with Kingdom Hearts. I miss him..GOD DAMNIT! IM SO FACKING BORED! I need a hug..*hugs herself for comfort..like always* Well, I only hug myself when im alone and scared. Switchfoot is playing..It calmns me down. I think they are christan band but who cares..I like some songs. Im Pagan and I don't give a fuck about who says something about me..Im sick of it and I just don't care anymore..It's not something I want to kill myself over anyway..*holds her Neopet tightly* If only you were real..Im still trying to get him from McDonald's..Nothing yet. Im sick of burgers..Greesy..Feh. I need to get ready for the Ren Fair. Im a pirate! Mah name be Luffy..I got it from One Piece. I was reading Shounen Jump and was thinking and there it was! So, I be Luffy..Heh...I feel so tired and bored..I miss my brother o.o

      Fighting again..But isn't that what couples normally do? I mean I love him with all of my heart, everyone can tell you that but...Im just so scared of someone walking by and taking him away. I was the wrong one to go and talk to a computer screen and fall in love with a computer screen. I should have gotten my ass up and told him what was wrong with me..I want to take all that back so many times. I always wonder in my head what would have happened if I would have did the right thing. But, it was my fault and I was the one who messed up comepletely. I mean at the time he was yelling at me and I got a little scared of him but I should have told him something. I hate myself and I always will. No one can make me love someone else. I loves Terik the whole time I was broken up with him. I told him I hated him because I was mad..I was too childish to speak up for myself. Im always sorry for myself and for others..I need more backbone..Well, a lot more backbone. I need to speak up to my mother every once in a while. Im not a child anymore so I shouldn't be treated like one. I always do better on paper than words..I don't know why though. I love to write and read. Anyway, back to Terik..I wish he could see how much I loved him because I don't think he knows well enough. He told me that he was unhappy..He also said that he tried telling me...I don't remember anything like that. If he did, he didn't tell me better. Im only 14..I may not know somethings like he does..He is 16 and a lot mature than I am. But, fighting Babe..It's not going anywhere..I don't want to break up. If we do break up, it would be you breaking us up because I don't want to. I love you..

      Terik and I are in the line of fire...I don't know what to do right now. I have to go 2 weeks without him. No one to talk to is going to hurt for awhile..It's not like it hasn't happened before. I was happy, but I don't know where that went. I will still love him no matter what. I left him before..and I don't want to ever again and I guess he doesn't see that. He said he was scared I would leave him again, but now im the one that is scared. He may have a lot of faults, but deep down..he is my Babe and no one else can ever see how much he means to me..How happy and excited he makes me feel. No one can ever give me those feelings like he can. I miss his arms around me and telling me that things will be ok...Because we are fighting and I hurt inside because im seeing our relationship tear and snap apart. Im holding my hands up high to hold everything together, but I need help..His help. If you do read this Terik...I love you. I have always loved you even though I did leave you. Im cold right now and I wish you were with me..Holding me tightly, saying that you love me more than anything. My tears and my screaming right now will never help anything. Crying helps nothing in this world. I am pathetic and I know I may be childish at times, but so are you too. I take the yelling and stuff that you do. Even though some things are not my fault and you yell or something, I take it and I still love you. Writing this may not help either, but when you don't have anyone to talk to..I can at least type it. Sometimes I wish I could take the pain away, take the hurt and tears..But I am not that strong..I am not the person I once was. My wings are damaged and I can't fly anymore..I think if I did want to fly, you would give me your wings. Wouldn't you? Im trying to think of times I had with you, but im so worried that you are going to leave me forever..I don't want that. I wish that I never have left you and caused us to be this way. I am the one to take the blame for that. If you do leave me, I will be a mess. I'll shatter and fall to pieces..I wish I could talk to you right now..To hear you say that you love me..I always get chills when you say that to me. You protected me and made sure I was safe, but I messed that up. I messed everything up. Love is so weird..It's so great one moment but painful the next. I would give anything up to have him right now..If he knew how much he means to me..Oh! If he only knew! 311 isn't helping as much as I thought it would..My music is always sad..Oh well..I love you Babe..Forever I will...

      I made some new friends today. They are my brother's friends, Adam and Brad, and they are cool. I guess having new friends are alright. I don't like them like them but just to joke around and laugh. Ah well..A lot of Kyle's friends are cool. I hope I get more friends..

      This house of mine is killing me. Im sick and fucking tired of being bymyself. I have no one to talk to...Im sick and tired of being sick and tired..Terik hasn't called me back..He said he would like 2 or 3 hours ago..Im losing my mind! I talk to myself and im trying to stay sane. I try to meditate and im losing consentration. Im scared of being in my house with nothing to do and no one to talk to. That is my greatest fear. . .dying alone. .

      Well, yesterday I was at Terik's house and I was on his comuter. I went to some site with flash movies and funny games and I happen to pick up some spyware. Like I meant to! He freaks out and yells at me.He found out today he had 80 something spyware. I understand that a computer is his life, but I thought I was more important..Am I? His loving girlfriend or a machine? He chose Final Fantasy XI over me yesterday when his mom was taking me home. Sometimes I wonder if he still loves me like I love him...And he tells me he loves me more. Im scared. He thinks im cheating on him again sometimes..*closes her eyes slowly* If he could just see what he does to me sometimes. Im sure he forgets. I know what other people would say to me right now, "You don't need him if he does that to you and you deserve better." Stuff like that, but..I love him. I always will and people can't seem to see that. I can take the shit he blows at me, not many can. Im a tough girl. I may act retarted, but im mature and smart inside. Im not a child like people say I am. I can straighten up when I need to. Yeah, I fuck up..I always fuck up, but im not perfect. No one or thing is perfect. Even if something was perfect, im sure it still won't be that great. I see nothing perfect.Straight lines aren't even perfect...This world, this world is filled with so many great people..and no one can equal up to him..No one. No one can see what I have for him, what I feel for him, what I do for him. Yeah, im still a little depressed, but it isn't because of him. Im scared to talk about friends of mine that are guys because he gets upset. I don't know what to do anymore though..I wish I could fix everthing..But then again, im not perfect..
