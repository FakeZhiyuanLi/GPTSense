      Going from one webmail site to another every morning to check your email becomes an extremely redundant routine after a while. Believe me, I maintain at least 7 email accounts from at least 5 providers. Even if you get all your email accounts from one provider, say Hotmail, logging in and logging out from one account to another could get annoyingly repetitive. And it's not like you can open multiple browsers and login to all your accounts at the same time (Yahoo and Hotmail get quirky when you try to log on to more than one account at a time).  This is where my cool discovery comes in: ePrompter! This nifty utility helps you check all your email accounts (webmail [most popular providers] or POP3). It sits silently (read: no nags, no ads, no spyware) on your system tray and simply signals you if you've got mail. You get an audio signal and the tray icon cycles thru the number of new email that you have in your accounts. Each account has it's own color so you know which account has new mail. You don't have much option for the audio signal, though--you only get 2 choices of sound or set it to silent.   ePrompter isn't just another email notification app. You can read your email from it (plain text only) and in some cases you can reply from it (I found the reply feature a little buggy).  I know most email providers have their own notification apps but those of us who use several providers might want to centralize everything. I know I do. Check this utility out and I'm sure it'll change your every morning routine! Oh, and did I mention it's absolutely free? Coolness!   urlLink http://www.eprompter.com/   Screenie of this extremely useful app:

      If you're like me and you have always wanted a Mac machine for it's cool-looking interface but find yourself buying an Intel-based machine instead all the time then this utility is for you!  Mobydock is an app launcher that emulates Mac's OS X dock. Yes, that cool icon bar usually at the bottom of the screen that gets animated when you mouse over them. It's way cool and people who see it for the first time will surely ask where you got the nifty tool. You can tell them you got it from  urlLink Mobydock . Best of all, it's free!  You can actually hide your Windows taskbar using Mobydock but it's not a complete taskbar replacement. Those of you who use lot of applications may be looking for a way to put your Start button on your Mobydock. You can always put the Start Menu Folder on it but when clicked, it will just open the folder. No cool looking drop-down lists.  Give it a shot!   urlLink http://www.mobydock.com/   Screenie to whet your appetite:    Footnotes: Mobydock only works on Windows 2000 and XP and requires DirectX 9.

      One of my unconscious pastimes, I discovered, is trolling the web for curious stuff. From interesting, unique, and useful websites and services to gears, deals, and apps. I would sit in front of my PC, fire up my browsers and search for random stuff via any search engine I happen to be on. After doing this for nearly 10 years now, I felt it would be nice to share my discoveries with everyone who cares to check out the cool stuff I happen to stumble upon. Well, this is the venue for that. Welcome to Nowdstuff!
