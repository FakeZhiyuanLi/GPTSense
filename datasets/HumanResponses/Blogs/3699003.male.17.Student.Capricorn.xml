      My head is slightly more clear than it was last week. As I probably mentioned somewhere on some blog, Sunday was excellent with the worship. (Three song medley.. woot.) I want to do more of that, and more spontaneous outbursts. It feels SO GOOD to use my talent for GOD!! It's like he's an amplifier, and he has all these wonderful pedals to tweak and refine my sound. OO I'm getting all metaphorical with music.! NOOOOO I've gone new-aged!   Writing.. It will come. I might even trash some former songs.. maybe morph them into one UBER song. ha. I'll work on arrangement and melody (definitely melody... need something unique) Then again, I keep coming back to really old songs that I heard when first a Christian and I didn't fully appreciate them at the time. Now I feel as if those songs have multiplied their meaning by a hundred times. It's wild, it's cool.. It's GOD, babe!! lol.. NOT GODBABE. Two words.  Keep it real, J-Dawg. Never EVER forget about what God has done in your life. (If you forget, you are the biggest asshole that I know!) Woot! Go Jesus, it's your birthday. We gonna party like it's your birthday.. gonna drink Bacar.. Wine like it's your birthday!

      Trying to piece together a pretty little set for tomorrow's worship. However, I've got like 5 superslow songs and only 1 or possibly 2 upbeat ones. Then again, worship shouldn't always be so up in the air. Needs to come down once in&nbsp;awhile.   I GOT THE CORN MAZE JOB!! WOOT WOOT! Found out yesterday. Was told that I did an excellent job on my interview on Monday. Looking forward to starting next Wednesday at 2:00 for orientation (even get to work a little bit and help set up.) &nbsp; My tooth hurts like crazy.. wisdom tooth coming up and hurting like mad! GRRRRS  So now that I have a job, I guess the only other thing I could need is... a girlfriend.. haha hehe hoho.. no. &nbsp; Gonna go play RCT or&nbsp; UT or C3.. something of the sort

      Strange that the second I got home from Penticton, all of the daily pressures and business of normal life took me away from my special time with God. Well I ultimately take myself away from that when I don't MAKE time for God to be speaking something new to me.  I was so frustrated but happy with the results of last weeks practice. Frustrated because some people wouldn't shut their yappers but happy that I could play some pretty music (even if the band wasn't always backing me up like they should). I'm trying to be more direct with what I want to hear (without sounding like an overbearing ass). Jules kept saying "K.. K.. let's go already! Play something!" and after rummaging through the song files for half an hour, I wanted to throttle her. Felt like snapping back, "Well, why don't YOU go through some songs and pick something then!?" but I kept my mouth shut and just made some sort of odd exhaling noise.  We tried to get two of the songs rolling. I wasn't comfortable with the melodies or lyrics for either one. So it was discouraging to see both of my songs crash before they even got off the ground. But I'm not backing out, not backing down.. I'm going to keep writing, keep practicing these songs until they're drilled into my head. Hopefully, something good will come of this.

      "I Will Sing" - by J.J.Johnson  I look around me Wonder what's this all about Some people lift their hands and I just wanna shout  If God's so amazing There should be no holding back This feeling inside me  No, there's no holding back    Chorus: I will sing, my lungs shout I wanna tell them what my God's all about I will dance, my heart raised I will tell them that my Lord's beat the grave I will praise, hands above I will tell the whole wide world about His love

      So I went another writing rampage on July the 3rd... only two days after writing my first two songs. This time I wrote three songs. One of them definitely meant to be fast and make people jump, another to be medium-paced (such as "Light the Fire") and another is "darker" I suppose, definitely needs minor chords and a slow tempo to carry it.   Reasoning, "My Life Will Worship You" Designation: 1 of 3  As usual, I started off with one somewhat catchy line... "My life will worship you".. From there it just goes off.. I was just thinking how I want to worship God with EVERYTHING I've got. (Sorta like that last verse/bridge from "M.I.F.", giving it ALL to Jesus.  I'd like to get out of this similar song writing rutt. Once you see all the songs together, you'll see the similar pattern in phrasing the verses and chorus. Hopefully the addition of music will fix that problem. "You inspire me... You create in me" worked into both verses give some continuity and the bridge is just cute and awesome.  Reasoning, "Vision of Beauty" Designation: 2 of 3  Again, the inspiration for the second song came from stray thoughts while writing the first song. This is that "darker" one I was talking about. I needed a little more "down" so I could lift it up abit more in the chorus. When a whole song is on a "high", it can get fairly annoying. Sorry for all the "words" but it's the best way I can describe the change in feel/tone. Took a chunk from "Amazing Grace" and did the ol' darkness into light bit. It works well here I think. Em, Am were some chords that I was throwing around for the verse. The dead senses bit is cool and asking for Jesus to give that new and full life is MEGA cool.  Reasoning, "I Will Sing" Designation: 3 of 3 (though it's my fave!)  Get up out of your chairs! This reminds me of Acquire the Fire, more specifically the song "Shout it from the Rooftops". The band Desperation does a kick-butt job so I didn't want to rip their song off or anything but I think the words, feel is totally set apart. Even the conservative worshipper should like this one. It's about spreading the good news of Christ by not only singing, but screaming, dancing, praising... all dedicated to God. Two verses and a chorus, seems to be the standard for most worship songs. Tells a little narrative through the verses, something I hadn't done before. Also I got rid of crappy repeatings. So I guess progress is being made there. High-tempo, high-energy but a controlled atmosphere for worship. It's possible.. I know it.

      "My Source" - J.J. Johnson  Defender of truth Protecting the week Lord show me the source of this love It's your heart that I seek    Chorus:  You are my source You are my light I wanna seek your face By day and by night You are my guide You are my start Lead me on this journey I want to seek your heart   Creator of all Choosing the meek Lord show me the source of this love It's your heart that I seek

      Reasoning: So this song was written frantically in the same night that "Most Intimate Friend" was conceived. God was really on a roll that night I guesss. The words "my source" had been floating around in my head as I was writing down my random thoughts. But I knew that "my source" was simply not going to fit into this first song so it needed a song of its own. When I was brainstorming lyrics for the verse of my first song (M.I.F.), I had written down "defender of justice and truth" and "protector of weak". I liked how that sounded and wondered how I could bridge that to "the source". Well, if God is the Defender, Protector, and the Source then there are no problems! I didn't want to make this one too complex. Some of the songs that have spoken to me the most have been only a verse and chorus.   One of the lines that changed was the 3rd line in each verse. "Lord unveil my eyes".. major snore I decided. It's been done too much. Plus, the verse and chorus still weren't tied together. "Lord, show me the source (of this love)" really gave the song a solid feel throughout. If I wanted to make either M.I.F. or My Source, the "faster" or more "upbeat" song, this would be it. I imagine distorted guitars and pounding drums everywhere! Picturing those ten thousand Acquire the Fire teens jumping up and down, singing of God, the source of all life and existence. See why I like it now?  After writing this one, I was mega mega pooped and my sudden burst of energy turned back into a sudden burst of sleep. No more songs for that night, but now I know that God will SPEAK loudly to me and I've got to be ready to jot those thoughts down. I imagine all of the "lost" songs that were never written. I've also realized through this how it's much easier to write the lyrics to a song and THEN compose the music to those words, rather than attempt to squeeze words into a preset bunch of music. Thanks God. Hoping to try these out really soon.  - J.J.

      Note: Work in progress, some words/phrasing may change slightly over time.   "Most Intimate Friend" - J.J. Johnson   You are my friend Never leaving my side Your arms are wide open I've got nowhere to hide This love amazes me  Not backing out Not backing down I'm giving this heart to you    Chorus:  My Savior, Redeemer Most intimate friend Through it all you've been with me You're my beginning and end I have nothing to fear, Lord As you hold onto my hand Oh Jesus you are, My most intimate friend   You are my King Always knowing what's true I'm sorry for lying To myself and to you This grace is over me  Not backing out Not backing down I'm giving this mind to you   Chorus   You are my truth Always shining your light Exposing my darkness You reveal a new life This power lives in me  Not backing out  Not backing down I'm giving my all for you (repeat?)   Chorus    Br. 1   Your love amazes me Your grace is over me Your power lives in me   Chorus    Br. 2  I'm giving my heart to you I'm giving my mind to you I'm giving my all for you   Chorus

      Reason: Driving with family to Penticton over what seems to be endless road on the Hope-Princeton Hwy when inspiration hits. Julia and I had gotten together last week to "make a song". Now, this is the second time we've tried this. The first song we put together a few months ago really... sucked. It was copy and paste from biblegateway.com and the lyrics were impersonal and weak. This time we had the chords all arranged and we sat around for two hours trying to think of words to fit the music. Without words, there was no song. So we agreed to both make lyrics for the same song and then slap them together.   Family driving, me tired and uncomfortable..looking for a way to pass some time. "Hark!Fetch me a pen and some paper!!" I start scribbling down random thoughts of praise and worship. One of the lines that I wrote down was "Savior, Redeemer, Most Intimate Friend"... I thought to myself, "wow, what an easy bunch of words to  describe my love for Jesus". I thought of some big words that could anchor some of the verses.. Healer, King, Truth. So these  words and others were underlined and boxed, scattered across the back of an old grovery list. Also written down was "Not backing out, Not backing down, I'm giving my heart to you. Love amazes me, Grace astounds me, Power takes me, grips me." Most of the chorus was already written down on the sheet of paper but it wasn't until LATE that evening that I woke up and felt the urge to start writing. I was really tired that night, went to bed at 8.. got up at 11, ate some sugar, went back to bed. I tossed and turned for an hour or so before going "WOAH!" I need a pen and paper. Some verses just came flying out perfectly while others required a little more time to work out perfectly. Even now, I consider the song to be "in progress." 3 verses, 3 pre-chorus, chorus, 2 bridges. It could be the next big thing on Friday night/Sunday morning. Fast or slow is yet to be determined. It would sound awesome either way.   The important thing is that the words came first, took first priority.. and the music will just naturally follow that. There may be some changes to arrangement as I work out the bugs with my guitar/keyboard in hand.

      Before I get too heavy into the sappy songs and poetry, thought I'd just give myself (and others) a heads up as to what this is all about.   I've tried writing a few songs in the past without any luck. I put together a sweet chord structure and melody only to find that I've just carbon-copied an 80's pop song. So now I'm trying a different approach to song-writing. With a worship-centred heart, I'll just let God speak to me and keep a pen and paper ready at all times. No "power sessions" can produce the music that God wants me to produce.   God, let this be the beginning of something superbly wonderful. Amen.  Rockin' for Christ - J.J. Johnson

      Yay! Though I didn't write any lyrics down from it, I had a brief period of inspiration this past week. It was alot of "Don't Worry, Be Happy" stuff. I had a rough week at work and was wondering how I was going to get through it but then I found (and heard) a couple of great verses about not worrying about men and worrying more about GOD. Doesn't matter so much what men think of me but it'd better matter to me what God's opinion is! I still need to fine tune the older songs and write some brand new ones down somewhere. I wanna talk about PEACE and REST in God. I feel at peace when I'm with him.. so true. I'm really tired from all the work too so I could always use a good rest.. no doubt. OO.. no doubt,.. if only it wasn't already a band name.. it could make the basis of a good song. Well I'm going to go post on johnsois1 now so I'll ttyl.. k?k? bye
