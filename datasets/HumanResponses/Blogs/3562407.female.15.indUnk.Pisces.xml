      Last night I was reading one of Dave Barry's articles and he said France had two attractions - the Eiffel Tower and the Coliseum (which is not in France, by the way.) I was thinking about Dave Barry and France and somehow my train of thought led me to this observation of French culture: The French don't like to sit. After we had spent several hours in the Louvre my friends and I gathered around one of the rare benches we had found. We didn't all fit, so the rest of us sat on the ground to show off our new souvenirs. Within seconds a security person came, forcing us to stand. We had to lean on the wall. Later, the whole group stopped to shop (shopping was, apparently, the sole reason many of the wealthier females signed up for the trip). Since my friends and I had no money/were saving the very little left/didn't desire to buy clothing, we wanted to just sit and talk. Impossible! We traversed the whole huge block and found onto two sets of benches, both covered with Parisians. We find a building with a convenient ledge and sit on it, but within a minute the man running in the store inside came and shooed us off. Now, since my pants cost less than the average computer, I was willing to sit on the more-than-slightly-dirty ground just for some rest (we'd been walking all day). I sat with my back against a tree, but even that wasn't allowed! We eventually gave up and returned. Even on the metros, only old people seemed to be sitting. There were often at least a handful of empty seats, while many younger people stood. I suppose the point of visiting a foreign country is to see what they do differently, but still. My feet hurt for days afterwards. And then of course there was their strange preference to serve food still bleeding (even the chicken!), but that's another story...

      I went bathing-suit shopping yesterday! Woo. I got four, lol. Two of which were actually bikinis! (watch as I don't wear either of them...) Also some shirts and shorts. I finally have enough clothing to make it through a week without having to do laundry! Now maybe I can go see my friends :) I feel very guilty. I don't really want to see my friends...I just feel like hanging around at home all day. But I won't be here long so I should keep in touch! I can make it til Saturday! Saturday is when I leave for Yellowstone, by the way. And after that we go straight to Canada - I won't be able to see anyone til school starts again. Don't worry, I'll miss you guys by then :) Probably...

      I just got back from the dentist! Whee! Half my mouth is numb! It looks so funny when I talk or smile; the right half of my mouth takes about a second longer to move than my left half. I had some good fun looking in the mirror when I first got back :p That was the only good thing about the dentist, though. It didn't hurt (much), but it was very boring. I hate dentist trips - it's so awkward, lying there as two total strangers poke your mouth with all sorts of funny-looking tools. I hate staring right up into their eyes, so I kept mine closed, and they thought I had some great fear of dentists or something; they kept saying things like, "It's all right" and "You're doing fine" Of course, they ask questions, too. We had a mini-conversation: Dentist 1: That's a pretty dress. Me: uh. (Thanks!) Dentist 1: But it's linen, right? That's so hard to take care of. Me: uh-uh. (No, it's some sort of cotton or..something. I'm far too lazy to wear linen.) ...well, it went along like that for a while. I'm too lazy to try to recall it all, but I'm sure it would be boring. The punchline is, at the very end Dentist 2 says, "You were a good patient. And your funny noises were cute, too." Gee...thanks...I guess.

      My dog may have seemed small before, but we took her to the groomer and they shaved all her fur off. Now she looks REALLY tiny, except her head and tail, which are the same size! She is so ridiculous...I'll try to get a picture to post :) Ahh, but she's still soft and cuddly. :) Yay for dog!

      They fight so much, and over such trivial things, that it's almost funny. Today, it was downright hilarious; I convinced the two to watch  Timeline  with me (pretty good movie, by the way. I didn't like how so many of them died in the beginning, though...) and all of 20 seconds after it's over, David (9 years) has insulted Brian (12 years) and thrown a pillow at him. And then this morning they were fighting because they each wanted to play a different game, and were struggling with the concept of "compromising." Of course, they couldn't go  read a book (gasp!) or anything else not involving each other...!

      I have a...unique method of cleaning my room. I empty all the drawers and cupboards into a huge pile on the floor, and then spend the next week or so putting everything back. The idea is, I'll throw away some stuff while I am putting things away. It must be working, because I've filled three trash bags so far! I haven't been able to read for a while because I've been working, but at last the huge pile is not nearly as tall! I can walk around my room once more! Of course, now it is a thin layer of stuff EVERYWHERE in my room, while before it was merely a tower of stuff in one point, so it looks messier...but I don't care! I get $10 when I'm done! Which I can then use to buy volume 11 of Fushigi Yugi (a manga I collect by Yu Watase). Yay!

      I am now the proud owner or a super-spiffy shiny new iPod! Yay! *does a happy dance* I've charged it and put my songs on and whatnot, and I've been walking around with it in my pocket...just because I CAN! It's so small, and it's not even a mini one! And I can get audiobooks for it, for when I travel. And it plays games! I'm in love...!

      For the past few weeks, I have been very...sneezy. I have had to take Dayquil and/or Nyquil all the time to keep things under control. Finally, today I went to the doctor and confirmed that yes, I do have allergies (mild ones, thank goodness). I return home with many samples of allergy medicines clutched in my hands, and the following conversation ensues: David (my little brother): Where were you? Me: The doctor, seeing if I have allergies. I do. David: What are those? Me: Samples of allergy medicines. David: What for? Me: For me to take, because I have allergies! For the record, David is 9 years old, and very silly. But he's cute...!

      In order to clean my room, I've piled everything I own in the middle of my floor and am slowly putting it all back. It's a fascinating process - I keep finding things I had completely forgotten about and used to love. Brings back a lot of memories...especially the half-filled journals (and there are a lot of those). Of course, then I throw them away.

      I've been doing the Kapman strategy workbook thingie("Guarenteed higher scores!") but I haven't gotten to the actual practice tests yet (too lazy...). Instead I've been doing the mini-quizzes at the end of each section. Verbal: 28 right, 1 wrong, 1 blank. Morale + 50. Writing: 19 right, 1 wrong, 0 blank. Morale + 50. Math: 16 right, 1 wrong, 8 blanlk. Morale - 700. Stupid math.

       urlLink    Sea_02000, a virtual pet from the website  www.neopets.com . I spend far more time than I ought to on that site, mainly playing games to make money. Sea Baby here is a Hallowe'en peophin - I also have a a Disco aisha named Bramina, a Starry shoyru name Shoyru6721, and a Silver zafara named Adriana422. I'm saving money to paint Addy Royal, though :) I spend many, many hours a day playing games and running a shop. If you're a member, send a neomailo my way! Username's blue__joy (TWO underscores). I've been playing about 3 or 4 years...moon_princess was my first account. My elder younger broter Brian shares my account with me. He hates it when I spend our money...

      My dog is even sillier than I am :) Her name is Emma and she weighs five pounds. Five pounds of pure cute! But alas, it is very stupid cute (no room for a brain in all that fluff). She randomly bursts into frantic barking and insists on being let outside (as if to protect us from an intruder), but as soon as she is through the door, she stops and looks back, as if to say,"Well? Aren't you coming?" She can only protect us if we protect her first.

      Hello, imaginary audience of many an varied people! My name is Laura, and I am here to ramble incoherently...I mean, entertain you. I have a great love of hobbits, and all things Tolkein. I also like other stuff. A lot of stuff. I could tell you all of it now, but it would take far too long and it would bore you to death (And trust me, it's not a nice way to go...far from painless). So instead, I will resolve to write often, allowing you to learn on your own through sundry pointless posts. Enjoy!

      I've finally gotten down to actually writing the story that's been banging around my head...sort of. I only have the first chapter done, but I want some opinions before I keep going; if the general concensus is that I suck, I'll start over. If it looks okay, I'll keep writing. SO! I would love it if people would take a look at it HERE: --sorry, I removed the link!--. You can read the story and even leave reviews even if you aren't a member of fictionpress.net or fanfiction.net. To leave a review, you need to select the drop-down menu in the bottom left of the page; it should be one of the options. Please do so, and let me know what you think! :D  ---  EDIT: The general concensus was that I suck. Or at least, the single person who had something to say said it sucked. I've changed it, and it's a  little  better (according to that person), but it still sucks, and it'll probably take a while for me to figure out all the things that suck, fix them, and then continue on in an un-sucky way, since I don't have any other outside opinions to help. Thanks for nothing!

      Yes, this is what I have been doing the whole time I have not been posting: reading! In a moment I am going to indulge myself in publishing my "Books I've Read" list, but before I do I want to highly recommend the author Lois McMaster Bujold to everyone! She writes an amazing sci fi series starting with "Shards of Honor", and has also written a very good stand-alone called "The Curse of Chalion".  Robin McKinley is also a good author; she writes fantasy books, primarily re-tellings of fairy tales. "Rose Daughter", a re-telling of Beauty and the Beast is very good, as is "The Hero and the Crown", which appears to be original fantasy. It has a sequel, "The Blue Sword", which could stand alone, but I am not enjoying it nearly as much as "The Hero and the Crown".  SO~! Reading list! It's not quite in order...   1. "Cordelia's Honor" by Lois McMaster Bujold (590 pages) - oh so delicious; it contains "Shards of Honor" and "Barrayar" in one; the first two books of her series (well, chronologically first, anyway). I love Cordelia. She's awesome.   2. "Doomed Queen Anne" by Carolyn Meyer (230 pages) - a short historical fiction; I hadn't know anything about her previously, so it was interesting. An okay book.   3. "Mary, Bloody Mary" by Carolyn Meyer (227 pages) - still reasonably interesting, but I already knew some, so not as much fun.   4. "Beware, Princess Elizabeth" by Carolyn Meyer (214 pages) - again, only a little interesting. It's sort of faded out of my memory...a sign it wasn't particularly good.   5. "The Supernaturalists" by Eoin Colfer (267 pages) - ooh, this one was a little creepy. I like Eoin Colfer, but he has a bit of a twisted mind. A good book, interesting - sci fi. The setting is unique, well thought out, a bit disturbing.   6. "The Time Cat" by Lloyd Alexander (206 pages) - a very quick read, a little repetitive, but still interesting. Meh.   7. "Rose Daughter" by Robin McKinley (292 pages) - ohhh, such a delicious book! Amazing detail, plot twist, character...gotta love it. And hey! Her two sisters aren't evil!   8. "Dune" by Frank Herbert (535 pages) - didn't finish as completely as I would have liked, so I guess I have to read the rest of the series. Actually, I didn't like the ending at all - the main character's personality suddenly changed, for the worse. But the rest of the book was great! Very well done. Of course. If it wasn't, it wouldn't still be popular! My parents read this book in college.   9. "With a Silent Companion" by Florida Ann Town (171 pages) - Interesting idea; it's the true story of a woman who disguised herself as a man and became a doctor. It didn't read like a novel, though, which disappointed me, but I forgive the author because apparently she kept her secret very well, and this was the first time anyone had been able to come up with a complete history of her life.   10. "The Day of the Triffids" by John Wyndam (198 pages) - AMAZING book. Loved it. So very good! Just...just read it. The opening line is, "When a day that one knows to be Wednesday starts out by sounding like Sunday, something is very wrong somewhere."   11. "Pilot's Choice" by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller (598 pages) - an omnibus of the first two books of an AMAZING sci-fi series. I love these authors! Love love love!   12. "Partners in Necessity" by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller (846 pages) - another omnibus, of the next three books. It is delicious! Oh so delicious!   13. "Plan B" by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller (331 pages) - just one book, next in the yummy series.   14. "I Dare" by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller (467 pages) - last book of the series. I didn't want it to end! It's so great!!   15. "Balance of Trade" by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller (453 pages) - it appears to be the start of a new, and equally delicious, series set in the same universe as the last one. I love these guys!    16. "Cordelia's Honor" by Lois McMaster Bujold (590 pages) - yes, I read it twice. It's good! Good!!!   17. "The Hero and the Crown" by Robin McKinley (246 pages) - quite good. Highly recommended. Fantasy; well-thought out, and I love the gradual release of information - it mentions things casually a few times before they're fully explained.    18. "The Curse of Chalion" by Lois McMaster Bujold (442 pages) - Mmm. Such a delicious book. More fantasy than sci-fi, which is new for her, but she does it well. I love Iselle! And Caz, of course. All the characters are real and lovable, actually. Even the "evil" ones have redeeming qualities. So read it!!  This list will be updated as I read more, just to give fair warning. So far I've read a total of 7,003 pages. Woo!

      I just finished a game of scrabble with word-masters Mother and Great-Aunt Marion. I love playing with them, even though I usually have to ask for help and rarely get anywhere near their scores. However, tonight, things ended as follows: Mother - 122 points Marion - 169 points Me - 182 points. And I used up all my letters first! It is a proud, proud day in the world of Laura. Not only did I get very close to a score of 200 (a milestone I have not yet met), but I also won! Against my mother and aunt Marion! Marion especially I consider to be a master at scrabble. She has, after all, been playing for eighty-some years.

      Sob! I called Betsy, the secretary at school, this morning to clarify some of my class choices - and it turns out the spiffy nre Newspaper class will be at the same time as Art and Drama.  (Insert cry of agony here: "Noooooooooooooooooooooooh!")  It's unfair! I already had a hard time choosing between Art and Drama, but now I have to choose between them  and  Newspaper? Come on! I was really looking forward to newspaper - and not just because my boyfriend is the Editor. I like writing, but I have trouble setting aside the time to do it. This would have been perfect! But alas, it was not to be. I chose Art in the end, seeing as Art is my one true passion in life, even though I suck. Not to mention my dream is to be a real manga-ka, which kind of requires some handle on art skills, and I desperately need to improve said skills if I want to even be able to produce sketches worth looking at. I suppose, on the bright side, that's one less thing that I'll  have  to do. Newspaper, Yearbook, and three plays  were  threatening to be stressful....

      Cookies! Yes, cookies. Chocolate cookies. With white  and  milk chocolate chips! And two full teaspoons of almond extract! Deliciously soft and surprisingly sweet homemade still-warm cookies! (Well, okay, they're cold  now ...) I made them last night, with Wyn's help. She just showed up and we hung out for a few hours, and talked, which was fun. I was a little surprised, as I hadn't seen her for quite a long time, and we had never hung out much. I was starting to think our friendship had died out, but I guess it hasn't! Yay! Cookies!!!
