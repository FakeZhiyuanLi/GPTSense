      Work On Rest Day....    I feel so sleepy.  Tonight, after years of waiting, finally, we are going to  urlLink Intramuros  to visit  urlLink WOW Philippines!  Uncle is going abroad next next day. This will be his "despedida party".  I hope that everyone in the family will have a good time.   Ruthie and I went to Grand earlier. Hahahaa...Amy did a very funny thing today.  She went home leaving her bag  to us!

         DOMz caught me  browsing my geocities. She told Aya i was sarcastic when she  asked me to close it. Was I? Anyways, what else happened today? Oh, I saw Dao Ming Si on tv last night. He was really charming! His tarpauline poster along Edsa (in front of SM) looks like my friend in Doulos. Mao-er pictures are developed already. She's really really cute! I wish mother can visit us now. I miss maui.  I think Topel will come a very long way! He applied for a CHED scholarship just last week and I think he got it. Well, at least it'll lessen my load...i promised to get him a cellphone this December. What else?  I miss Pink Smelly. I also miss Lovesky...i will email her tonight.  That's all for today. Lesson I learned today???  Careful! Take a lot of precautions......people are watching you and before you knew it...they have stabbed you on your back already. Now...where did I get that? don't know.....just thought it would be a sensible thing to write hehehe be back...if i have time...i'll have to update my geocities again. mwah

      Forgot to log what happened yesterday..... amy bought a keyboard worth 15,000++......i like to buy one too...it's beautiful rochele treated us brunch at KFC....what else happened? Oh....i never look at SKANK anymore  as for today.....i knew it...either amy will be late or absent........well, she's not here right now.  our pics on mt.tarak are in the web already...take a look! it's so wonderful up....i remember how we struggle for 6 hours to be there....... i thought i've almost break my right leg!  stargazing on top of a mountain along with people you love is definitely  a wonderful experience  it happens once in a while.......so u really have to cherish it for who knows, you might not do it again i love every seconds of my stay on Mt. Tarak...it was tiring but fulfilling.... i couldn't explain what i felt coz it was a mixture of all emotions! dizzyness, hunger, thirst, lumbago, cramps, stress, headache,burden, anger, passion, excitement, challenge, victory, triumph and everything! i don't know if i'd be able to come back to this mountain again....i could still remember how i hated to continue the trek but wouldn't want to be left out, so since  i've no choice.....i really have to go with them! along the trail...you will feel all bad about it but on top...it's different....you wont feel tired....you'll love the cool breeze that embraces your body.....it's so refreshing it feels like going inside the refrigerator after long hours of exercise!  this december...they plan to go to Mt.Pulag....truth is, i'm excited about it but i'm not sure i can join them.  be back!

      I hope mother and Maui can come with Topel this November......I miss them terribly. Especially Maui. ( Maui is my baby sister and she's a year and a half only) They say we look so much alike.  Well, Uncle is going abroad this afternoon. I forgot to blog about our trip to Intramuros....unfortunately, as we were to go out from the compound already......with all our stuffs and foods.....there poured a heavy rain! Everybody was excited...we ended up eating our BAON in the canteen. It rained so hard but most of us were still willing to push the plan...except for the elders. Back home, i decided to continue my sleep! while the rest of the family sang videoke selections and played poker games.  I was kinda little upset because a good friend whom i'll call "Pink Gorgeous Smelly " doesn't know how to appreciate little efforts....little kindness.  What else......I hate BEAN PANCAKE SKANK/Rabbit-ear Frisky Tongue ! I don't know why it turned so bad this time when few weeks ago...i thought he was charming! But now.......it's different! Well...PINK LONG NOSE is having her rest day....I am beside PLASTIC FAIRY EYES right now.   check this out  urlLink nickname generator   that's all for today!  always, Fairy Plastic Spunk

       I watched this program earlier on TV. I was really touched. I couldn't help myself. I was crying along with  urlLink Bernadette Sembrano  . The story pierced my heart. I forgot the name of the sender who was suffering bone cancer and before God takes her life, she wish to see her family...her children particularly, 4 of them. The sad part of the story was that she left her husband and their children in Bohol without telling them where she'll be! Her wish was granted. The staff of WISH KO L ANG went all the way to Bohol to look for the family....they were teenagers already. Her husband was happy and declared..."salamat nman at may dumating na grasya". He didn't know that her wife has been living with her boyfriend since the moment she left the province....all the more, he didn't know that her wife is dying of bone cancer. The staff had him  read the letter her wife sent them...so as not to shock him when the moment of truth comes. He was trying hard to hold the tears but he couldn't stand it. He cried as he was reading it.  I knew how he felt. I haven't had that same kind of heartache but i knew just how it felt.  And so they came, 5 of them.  Oh God! The scene was so moving it made the rest of us watching cried! She kept on asking her children to forgive her. The eldest son embraced the mother first and the rest of them followed. All of them crying so hard. The husband could only offer a handshake...the strange boyfriend was beside the wife. I admire her husband for having the courage to forgive her as well as the boyfriend. He even told the boyfriend to never stop taking care of her wife....and he was crying while telling him all these things.  For a moment I realized how valuable one's family can be. When you're on the downest point of your life, no one and nobody will love you more than your family could! I hope all of them will be happy in the end. They looked happy on TV....especially the wife. But it's hard to be happy in this kind of situation...money was scarce and they live on a shabby neighborhood. At least now that she've seen her children....she'll be more at peace with herself. She is so thin that i think she'd die any moment now.  I wish none of these happen to me in the future. I don't know how i can handle these things if I were in their place. I have learned a lot from the story. First thing, the importance of family - a husband to love until the end, children to take care until they learn to stand on their own.....in short...A FAMILY to love and to hold forever. Second, Life is short and anytime God can take it away from you.....so you try to live it well and make the most out of it.....Third, learn to forgive...no matter how painful it is to your part!   As I was watching the show, i feel blessed. I now appreciate the pay i'm getting from my job because it helps me sending my brother to college. I thank God for  the home i have because it keeps me warm and safe everyday. I thank God for my family because with them I feel my sense of belonging and security. I thank God for all my friends and those people i've met along the way because they bring out the best in me. And for all the problems and trials I've had, I thank God.....because they made me the kind of person that I am now..wiser and stronger. i thank my officemates...RUTH who has been  with me since time immemorial...and for making life a lot easier!Also,  AMY for not asking too much about this job...coz it inspires me. JANIS, for all her never ending stories that made me laugh most of the time. PRING, for being there when I'm in NEED. L2SUMMIT people for bringing me to mountains I  never could have imagined to conquer......DOULOS family for letting me see what my purpose in life is....YOU PEOPLE ARE ALL NECESSARY TO ME!    God has blessed me with so much..... Haay.....Life has many twists and turns. You'll have all the money but not a loving family...and vice versa. Sometimes, you"ll have no money and no family at all!   I thank God for whatever I have now.....nothing I could ask for any greater thing... But let me still have my own WISH........  Or i'd say wishes...  Family.....faith, hope and more love! Madam.....Lots of Yen from Migz Mitch...a boyfriend  Migz.....lots of Yen to give Madam Owen....a graduation certificate  Ruthie.....a happy life with Jun and their children! Amy.....truce between her kuya and hipag.....also, a lovelife with somebody who's the like of Abe and a keyboard Janis....a new high-paying job  Pring...the most hightech computer in this world Rochelle....lots of love from the man he loves  Myself.......a life full of joy, peace, abundance and love  Be back later.....need to find something in the web

      I'm so tired of being here Suppressed by all my childish fears And if you have to leave I wish that you would just leave 'Cause your presence still lingers here And it won't leave me alone  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  [CHORUS:] When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears I held your hand through all of these years But you still have All of me  You used to captivate me By your resonating mind Now I'm bound by the life you left behind Your face it haunts My once pleasant dreams Your voice it chased away All the sanity in me  These wounds won't seem to heal This pain is just too real There's just too much that time cannot erase  [Chorus]  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone But though you're still with me I've been alone all along

         KOTSE  Itong si Joaquin, bata pa lang ay meron nang obsession sa kotse. Nagsimula ito noong regaluhan siya ng tatay nya ng Matchbox na racing car. Gustung-gusto nya yung regalo at halos oras-oras ay nilalaro nya ito. Sa kanyang paglalaro pinangarap nya na kapag lumaki sya, bibilhin nya ang pinaka-magarang kotse, katulad ng laruan nya.  Pumasok si Joaquin sa Elementary. Siya ay napakatalino. Nagto-top sya parati sa klase. Consistent sya sa pag-aaral. Valedictorian siya nung graduation. Sa kanyang isipan, ginagawa nya ito hindi para sa kanyang mga magulang, kundi para sa kanya na balang araw, mabibili nya yung gusto nyang kotse.  Matapos ang Elementary, pumasok sya sa High School. Tulad ng dati, siya ay palaging Honor Student. Napakagaling nya sa klase. Isa lang ang motivation nya. Ang makabili ng gusto nyang kotse.  Sa college, ganun din. Kasam a sya parati sa Dean's List. Halos tangurian siyang genius. Marami ang humahanga sa kanya. Simula first year hanggang graduation, wala siyang mababang grade. Sa kanyang pagsusumikap, parati nyang naiisip ang kanyang pangarap na makabili ng kotse. Dahil dito, very inspired sya.  Nakatapos si Joaquin ng pag-aaral. Madali siyang nakakuha ng trabaho. Ang trabaho na pinili nya yung merong car incentive. Ginalingan nyang magtrabaho para ma-qualify sa incentive. At dahil sa kanyang mga merits, nakuha nya ito.   Birthday niya nung matanggap niya ang kotse. Honda Civic, kahawig ng laruan niya nung bata pa sya. Very excited sya. Pinandar niya ito kaagad. Nilibot niya yung Metro Manila. Maghapon siyang drive ng drive. Nakalabas siya ng Metro Manila ng hindi niya namamalayan. Drive pa rin siya ng drive. Hanggang dis-oras na ng gabi, drive pa rin siya ng drive. Tuwang-tuwa siya. Sa wakas natupad din ang pangarap nya.  Hating-gabi na ng namalayan niya na hindi na niya alam kung nasaan siya. Masyado ng madilim ang paligid at rough road na ang dinadaanan nya. Naliligaw na siya.  Dahan-dahan na lang siyang nagmamaneho nang pigilin siya ng limang lasing na lalaki.  "Pare, naliligaw ito. Wow, bagong kotse." sabi ng isa.  "Baba... baba..." pasigaw na inutusan si Joaquin.  Bumaba si Joaquin ng takot na takot.  "Gulpihin natin 'to, mga pare." sabi ng isa.  "Huwag, pag-tripan natin." sabi naman ng isa sa lasing.  Takot na takot si Joaquin. Hindi malaman kung ano kanyang gagawin.  "Natataranta pare. Anong gagawin natin dito?" patawang sabi ng isa.  "Alam ko na, halika dito." nakangising sabi ng isa kay Joaquin sabay guhit ng pabilog sa baku-bakung kalsada. "Tumayo ka sa bilog na yan at huwag kang lalabas. Kung hindi, papatayin ka namin." sabay tawa.  Tumayo si Joaquin sa ginuhit na bilog . Takot na takot na nakatingin sa mga lasing.  Nagtawanan ang mga lasing sabay basag sa side mirror ng bagong Honda. Tiningnan nila ang reaction ni Joaquin. Nagulat sila ng makitang nakangiti ito.  Binasag nila ang windshield at binutas ang gulong. Tiningnan nila si uli Joaquin. Nagulat uli sila ng makitang nakangiti pa rin ito at pinipigilan ang tawa.  Nagalit ang mga lasing. Pinag-papalo at pinag-sisipa nila yung Civic. Tiningnan nila uli si Joaquin. Ngayon, hindi lang nakangiti si Joaquin, tumatawa pa, tawa ng tawa.  Ang ginawa ng mga lasing, sinunog ang kotse. Pagkatapos, tiningnan nila si Joaquin. Laking gulat at pag-tataka, tawa ng tawa si Joaquin. Halos ma-iyak na ito sa kakatawa.  Lumapit ang mga lasing kay Joaquin at nag-tatakang nagtanong: "Sinisira na namin yung kotse mo, bakit tawa ka pa rin ng tawa?"  Sumagot si Joaquin na ma-ngiyak-ngiyak sa kakatawa: "Kasi habang hindi ka yo nakatingin, hi..hi..hi (hindi mapigil ang tawa) lumalabas ako sa bilog..ha.ha.ha.ha!!!"

      The Reason Lyrics Hoobastank   I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You  and the reason is you  and the reason is you and the reason is you    I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you
