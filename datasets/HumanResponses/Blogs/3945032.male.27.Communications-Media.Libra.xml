           I listened to this score for the first time while watching the film, then for the first time on CD last night and then again this morning at work and I must say that I am impressed yet again with Beltrami's work.   Hellboy, IMHO, is one of the best comic-book scores since Elfman's Batman and I, Robot is right up there with one of the best Sci-Fi scores in the past few years.   It has been reported the Beltrami had only 2 1/2 weeks to write and record his 90 minute score after Trevor Jones left the project, so the pressure was on Beltrami to deliver the goods. Well, after hearing this score I guess the pressure didn't get to him.   It's great to see Beltrami getting a chance to move away from the horror-slasher films that dominated his earlier works. It's not that his work in the genre was bad... but it easy for composers to get type cast (i.e. - John Debney - The Comedy Composer) With Beltrami's work on smaller independent films and now these large action blockbusters we are starting to see what kind of potential Beltrami really has. There was no doubt in anyone's mind Beltrami was talented, it's just that we had never heard him score anything other then a horror film.   Anyway, back to I, Robot.   Beltrami's action music has always been strong (Scream, Mimic) and it's getting stronger in works like Hellboy and I, Robot. The Jerry Goldsmith influence is apparent as Beltrami employ's similar timing and rhythms that Goldsmith use to use. Cues like "Tunnel Chase" and "Spiderbots" employ Goldsmithesque driving rhythms, electronics and interesting orchestrations.   Beltrami also showcases his epic side with a cue called "Chicago 2035" which is an awe-inspiring piece that is played over a breathtaking shot of a futuristic Chicago where The Sears Tower is no longer the tallest structure.   And finally, "Round-Up" features a powerful orchestral and choral finale that is a perfect end to this impressive score.   The only thing that bothered me was that just as I was really getting into the score the 45 minute running time of the CD was up. Now, I applaud Varese for releasing more then just 30 minutes of score... it's just me personally who was craving for more. I guess I'll just have to play the album again or re-visit Hellboy!   This is another impressive score by a composer who is finally getting the respect he deserves. Congratulations Marco!!!       &nbsp;   urlLink

      The following was published on the  MusicfromtheMovies.com  web site and I thought you would be interested in reading it.   A note to Jerry Goldsmith's fans from his agent, Richard Kraft   The last time I saw my friend Jerry Goldsmith was with Bob Townson as we presented him with Varese Sarabande's "Jerry Goldsmith at 20th Century Fox" boxed set.  Though he was not feeling well that day, Jerry's spirits lifted instantly as he pulled the booklet from its black slipcase. Slowly, he poured over every title like he was exploring a photo album of his children, each one dear and special to him in a different way. He shared memories of working on those scores which spanned several decades of his life.  He was surprised and delighted when he was told that its entire run had sold out within days of its announcement. It meant a great deal to him that his fans continued to appreciate him so strongly.  Jerry cared deeply about his fans (I should know, I was one who first met my idol by stalking him as a rabid nine year-old armed with overstuffed shopping bags crammed with soundtracks for him to autograph). Jerry was also a very private person and extremely shy.   Even though it would sometimes embarrass him, I would often share with him tidbits from his supporters on the various film music sites. All of your love and appreciation gave him great comfort and pleasure.  The last opportunity Jerry had to connect with his public was two weeks ago when John Mauceri cell phoned him from the podium of the Hollywood Bowl smack dab in the middle of a concert so Jerry could hear the "Goldsmith Television Medley" he was about to conduct. At the final downbeat Mauceri hoisted his cell phone towards the audience so Jerry, lying at home, could take in the monstrous applause of 19,000 of his fans.  Jerry Goldsmith wrote music, not for himself, but to connect with others. He was very blessed to know that he succeeded in doing just that for so many years with so many people around the world.  Thank you all for letting him know how much you cared.  Richard Kraft Kraft-Engel Management

      On July 21, 2004 Hollywood lost one of its greatest legends in composer Jerry Goldsmith. In honour of his great career I have created a special Jerry Goldsmith page at the CINEMATIC SOUND web site. There, you can listen to 3 hours of Jerry Goldsmith’s greatest scores ranging from THE BLUE MAX to LOONEY TUNES: BACK IN ACTION. The show that you will hear is a re-broadcast of Jerry Goldsmith’s 75th birthday show that aired in February of 2004 and presented close to 40 of his greatest themes, cues and concert works. To listen to the show please click  urlLink HERE.   There are two options for listening to the program. By clicking over each "hour box" on the page you can play the high-bandwidth version. Or, if you have a slower connection, you can click on the low-bandwidth option.  This program will stay on the site until August 31, 2004.  If you want to play the show in the external Real Audio Player click on the embedded player and select ’Play in RealOne Player.’   If you have any problems listening the show please e-mail us at cinematicsound@yahoo.com.  Enjoy!

           Well, I'm giving this one a try and so far I like what I hear. I'm not a huge fan of Zimmer's but occasionally he surprises me... and King Arthur is a score I could see myself going back and listening to again. The score's main theme is bold and epic with a powerful Zimmer patented all male choir underneath it all for added power. The action cues are thunderous as Zimmer employs an army of percussion overtop his orchestra and synths. Some of the action cues remind me of Horner's battle music from Braveheart which begin slowly but build up stream towards the end of the cue.   Now, with all this praise there is one thing that I am disappointed with... and that would be with the song at the beginning of the album, "Tell Me Now (What You See)." These types of pop songs in medieval epics have got to go!!! Besides that, the score is a loud and muscular work that Zimmer fans salivate over and the non-Zimmer fans might actually enjoy! 31/2 out of 5.       &nbsp;

           I was never a big fan of Craig Armstrong's work and his score to The Clearing is not going to convert me into one. The score is written for droning synths, moody strings, delicate piano, harp and minimal woodwinds. The score is monotonish (is that even a word?) with no real melody or theme to speak of and doesn't really do anything interesting orchestration wise.... although, this effect might work perfectly with the picture. But, on a stand alone listen I don't think this score will have many people singing it's praises. Now, I did mention that there really isn't a melody in the score... well, that's not entirely true. There are about four or five of the 25 tracks that have some sort of slow building melody to speak of which is performed on piano in one cue, violin in another and then with full orchestra in the other. It's a nice theme but I don't think anyone with me humming it walking out of the theatre or after listening to the CD. This isn't a disappointing score as I didn't really expect much when it came down to listen to it. I just feel that film music fans might have a better appreciation for this type of score while watching the film rather then listening to it by itself! 2 out of 5.       &nbsp;

      Welcome to my new Blog... everyone has one so why can't I? So, just what in the world is the point of this. Well, basically, if I have something to say, I type it here and let the rest of you read it! Actually, this is kind of a replacement for my old news section which was hardly updated... and this page won't be any different. However, there is the occasional time that I do have something important to say and will publish it here... like a new score review, some film music news, and excuses as to why I will not be producing a new show during a certain week.   Anyway, enjoy reading my random thoughts and please ignore the terrible spelling and grammer.   -Erik-
