           Sitting in an airport in Cincinnati waiting for a flight to Champaign.  Im excited because in under four hours ill be with bubby and I havent kissed him in so long my lips have nearly forgotten the feeling. Hold on... I need a second to think about it... his warm moist yummy pink lips pressed against mine.... his body close enough for me to press myself against him... I try to slip him some tongue and he says ive gone too far and pretends to slap me and then giggles to himself. Why do my fantasies about him entail his play-rejection?  He does it too often its offending my psyche I think. No actually its adorable but still I should tell him to take his hamster seriously or she will take her roller ball elsewhere. We are so gonna make out and im totally gonna try to have my way with him when I get there. Its been almost 6 weeks and I think im getting carpal tunnel in his absence.       Havent slept yet and its almost 9 am- spent last night out in the city at a place called Le26 which falsely advertised as having Vietnamese food. Lets just say I had ravioli in this 'fusion' restaurant. Places are taking fusion too another level- I saw a guy getting a steak and French fries at another table. A funny food story (well as funny as i can be when I have yet to sleep) was a few weeks ago at Sushi Samba- We are slightly trashed by the time our table is ready and I keep ordering their raspberry Mohitos  and get to the part of the night where  I can barely see- let alone order food. Somehow I manage to decipher the wavy lines of scribble and order something made of little fishie (im a terrible person and definitely going to hell). My food gets to the table and im soOOoo excited (the kind of excitement you can only have over food when drunk) Well, about halfway through my meal I turn my plate a bit and let out an 'OH...Oh...oh... I think im gonna be sick' as I stared eye to eye with the poor little being whose flesh I was devouring. Salivation immediately- parasympathetics going wild- stomach starts to get funny. What have I become? Poor little animal. The guilt of being a carnivore is a discussion best left for another time... Back to Le26 (promise to stay more on track)- Heres a look at their normal clientell: theres a couple consuming eachothers faces at the table behind us; on the other side of us was a table or 25 year old- wanna-be-ballers... Suddenly I thought I was back in Miami. Once at BED I was making fun of the peoples snotty attitudes- I said something along the lines of  "these people take two hours getting ready, arrive, look fabulous, walk around being stuck up, and going home alone..." This guy says to me 'yeah but what you dont know is that half of these people are models or actors' to which my roommate deepa said 'well you can tell these models to bring me my next spinach salad at their real job.' I think you had to be there. Le26 ill try to start again.  Our waiter comes over to us and leans down next to me getting really close. I think hes going to ask us to move tables or ask me to ask my roommate to stop smoking- SOMETHING to show displeasure at having a table full of kids in his section. He had forgotten my drink order- no big deal but  after he leaves my friend says he thought the waiter was going to ask me out because of how close he got and how he looked at me... Funny how different my internal and external realities are. I still think I your typical punk-rock princess and anticipate peoples prejudices before I give them a chance to form an opinion... gotta remember I wear the studded belts on the inside now and people may be looking at me for reasons other that just to stare at "that girl."  On a completely unrelated note I think I want to have an RV instead of a first home, that way whenever I want to take off and travel to Disney world I can do it without a second thought. I wonder what my bubby will think of that- how he'll feel about parking his super-cars in front of a rv lot. Should I be offended if he says he wont come over? I think my plane just got hereÂ

      Scroll down to where he begins making lists of the kinds of girls he wont date. Thank you to contraversion.com for making this guys ad public...   http://www.craigslist.org/sfc/m4w/33208956.html  heres a preview of the infinite wisdom he has to offer:  3- Miss Romance  This type of woman lives in a fantasy world of Lifetime Channel movies and romance novels. Every night she goes home alone to spend hours flipping through her bride magazines, imagining that, at any moment, Prince Charming will ride up on his white horse, sweep her off her feet, and offer her a problem-free existence for the rest of her life. The Miss Romances of the world have been coddled by parents and family, told they are "princesses," and have absolutely no idea that real life consists of paying bills and cleaning toilets. Miss Romance will expect to be taken care of, will be a dud in bed, and will, almost overnight, turn into a shrieking nag. Run.   I wonder if posting this makes me a 'miss-bitch'

      Besides the obvious reason of his ability to put up with my little idiosyncrasies, these are some of the reasons I think I have the best Bubb-bee ever...  1. He has an amazingly cute everything- from the little freckle on the tip of his button nose (he has a ton of child-like features and will never look over 18- this makes me feel like a rockstar robbing the cradle-YEaH!) to the fact that he cant grow facial hair (you can count them they are so sparse- maybe i should verify his age now that I think of it) to the fact that his pants sit just above his butt and if you lift his shirt you are certain to see his little booty (i hear butt-crack is the new cleavage, and hes got great cleavage)... and he has the prettiest skin ive ever seen which complements his dark hair and hazel eyes in ways i shouldnt get into now cause it drives me crazy and im trying to keep this PG-13 for the kids...yeah, my bubb-bee is just hot in general, nuff said.  2. He makes being a stoner kinda cute and named our first 'love-doll' Resin... hot pants is soOoo cleaver.  3. Hes alergic to alcohol but drinks through the pain- turning the brightest shade of red you could imagine a person being- my hEeeRO!  4. Hes one of the only responsible boys ive ever met who still mangages to be kinda cool. He used to make a line of skate/snow-bro clothes and when we have time before residency starts up im sure he'll start up the company again cause he's a go-getter and even his hobbies are more productive than other peoples jobs... i want him to make me a shirt with his face on it so I can show him off even when he's not around.  5. I can never get sick of him and he doesnt seem to get sick of me either... which is really strange in itself... and even when i get 22 out of 24 hours of his day- im left wanting more. Boy put a spell on me or something.  Next set of 5 soon to come....

      Christmas has become a really tough time of the year for me. My parents put an end to the mystery of Santa Clause when I was quite young. My fifth Christmas promised to be the best one I could remember (when you're five im not sure you actually compare holidays much but hey this is my story so ill tell it like I want to). Me and my dad spent Christmas eve putting together my shiny pink and purple HOFFY bike- training wheels and all- the exact one I wanted and it seemed like all my holiday wishes were coming true- WHO ONLY KNOWS WHAT SANTA WOULD BE BRINGING TO ADD TO MY FESTIVE JOYS. I could barely sleep that night- thoughts were racing through my head- did I place the milk and cookies where Santa could see them- would the milk spoil- maybe I should have just had mom write a note saying where the milk is kept in the fridge... will Santa get dysentery and stiff me on a gift next year (okay this seems far fetched, ill admit to it before you accuse me- but hey, I was a sharp little cracker at that age- Ill remind you that this was the pre-drug phase of my life- although not by much). Somehow I made it through the night of anticipation without giving myself a panic attack (these would plaque my undergrad experience) and emerged from my bedroom Christmas day with hope and joy overflowing from my very being... Thoughts of THE TREE and THE PRESENTS hit me and before I knew it I was running down the hallway smiling ear to ear. Everyone else was awake- the bastards were starting without me. I started unwrapping my presents- tissue paper and wrapper flying around my face as I speed through the predictable family gifts- WHERE WAS SANTAS PRESENT?? I turned to the bike- eager to ride it- but still confused about the lack of Santa gifts... what was going on- had Santas milk gone bad like id feared- was his punishment starting this year instead of the next- ARGHHH it was too much for my already neurotic little brain to take! My mom took the card off the bike and began to read. By the end of the last line my stomach was on the floor. It was a present from Santa. Apparently there had been a lack of communication between my parents and my mom didn't know I had helped put the bike together. At the time I just thought Santa was a cheap bastard who was trying to pawn off my parents presents as his own, but later in the day my older brothers would explain what had happened to me. We didn't celebrate Christmas much after that. Im sure by the time I was 10 we stopped even having a tree. I was ashamed that my family had no Christmas spirit and to this day I still hold a grudge about it. When I have my own family, Christmas will be a huge event. For now I continue to make up for my lack of Christmas with amazing new years eves and halloweens- the two holidays you dont need your family to celebrate. I expect boys I date to make a big deal of valentines day and my birthday- when they dont, feelings I have towards my family and the holidays emerge and I displace those feelings towards my then bo. 6 of the last seven Christmas' have a story. One of shacking up with an ex-boyfriend in an empty house in London. Two others of laying in a bed in the middle of BFE Scotland with the first boy who ever made me feel 100% adored. One of trying to get back to the US while the trains were all down in England to get to my father who had had an emergency triple bypass (the event that made me go to medical school in the first place) and breaking up with said boy who adored me in the process. The next of being in Paris with my best friend and Swedish rockstar boyfriend- on our way to Amsterdam where I intended to have my first girl-on-girl experience/ first paid-sex-act experience (which never actually happened). One uneventful Christmas (im sure im just blocking whatever did happen out), and the last one- where I realized the boy I had been going out with for the last year didn't really love me, or did but didn't know it. It was ironic because he was the first boy i had ever 100% adored and the experience ended up setting off a string of events that would leave me spending Christmas in south beach at a gay bar on a double date with three other straight people- enjoying the night immensely. This Christmas seeing as I have no plans to leave the country (those seem to be the only Christmas' that work out for me) ill take extra shifts in the ER or pediatric ward. Maybe I can help make someone else's Christmas a bit more tolerable.

      If you want to think like a hamster you have to speak like one. Lesson one:  1. Use the word 'chonchie' in describing a vagina- as in 'put that thing away adonie- you're not getting any chonchie.' 2. Call everyone a 'beetch' especially when totally inappropriate. 3. Growl and grunt- expect others to know what it means. 5. Always call your computer a 'pooter-' it makes others uncomfortable which pleases 6. Refer to cats as 'pussies.' when they are far away yell out 'lit-tle- puss-see come here baby'(refer to number 5) 7. Talk incessantly about your animals- it makes you seem intriguing 8. Say 'boo-ger shoo-ger' with a big grin... see who gets it. 9. Always insist you are right- even when its ridiculous. 10.yell 'am I loud' when you have on headphones, look around confused when others scour. 11.Practice your most innocent look in the mirror for hours, look up at your boyfriend/girlfriend and say in the smallest voice possible 'fuck me pwease... daaa-dee....pweEEeease dadddy- pwease!' ignore their look of disgust, giggling to yourself with confidence and proclaim line number 12. 12.Say 'im soOooOo funny' every time you make a joke- look to others waiting for signs of approval.

      a friend of mine is starting a company that rents out dates for men- not in an escort type of way and without the option of buying a happy ending...  Let me explain. YOu purchase a womans company for the evening at a rate of 50 dollars an hour- she is guaranteed to be charismatic and to catch the attention of those around her. You take her to a club or bar where you hope to meet OTHER women. Her attentiveness and charm catch the eyes of those around you. This leads to both men and women checking out WHO IS SHE WITH... This works because there is something in our second X chromosome that encodes for competitiveness- or maybe its just thousands of years of learned helplessness that keeps us looking for the best provider- but reguardless of the reason- we want that man who shes with! Ill explain the reasoning further because i think its really fucked up but kinda funny at the same time- if the guy isnt so good looking the women are thinking - hey, is he the next bill gates or something to have such a charming companion who by looks alone and charisma is way out of his league? Suddenly a guy who they would hardly have accepted a drink from is the new prize of the bar/club... she starts imagining what his life must be like and inserting her face into the daydream... hes probably an incredible lover. If shes gutsy she'll make a move then, if not, next time she sees him out without the companion he will still have the same draw he had that night because she'll remember the fantasy she had of the two of them enjoying the lavish lifestyle he can provide for her. The drawback- these are the kind of women youll attract- which to me is not attractive AT ALL- but hey- if hey if you are enlisting this service you probably want to attract trophy women/glorified bracelets and are having difficulty doing it on your own- and who am I to judge. This works best because he is doing this in Miami- if you've been there you'll know what im talking about. God I hope this makes my friend rich.

      i remember the first day i saw my little yellow prince. He was sitting in the library on the phone. Conveniently there was an empty computer next to him and I sat down (no eye contact ofcourse- id have died if he had looked up).  I was having dificulty with a setting on the computer and he turned and asked me if I needed help. Thank you electronics for making me the damsel in distress on this occasion- its not a position i like to be in normally but when a guy is so cute I can barely look at him- ill take any help I can get. He got my computer working and returned to his conversation while I typed away- all the while listening in on what he was talking about. So i gathered he was from LA- how excitting that the hottest boy i had seen on campus was also a southern califonia transplant and from his band-propaganda-t-shirt and haircut- also obviosuly one of my breed. Hello scenester- hear me meow. Here comes the catch- what a BORING conversation he was having with the poor girl on the other end (who i gathered was his girlfriend). You know the kind of conversation that makes you want to pull your hair out and scream- or just HANG THE *#@! up. So cute and yet so dull and soOoo taken. =( My ears practically bleed from listening and my heart really went out to that poor undoubtably bored girl he was talking to... that was until i thought about the fact that she got to bang that cute little boy with the band t-shirt and button nose.  Fast forward a few weeks and insert lots of stolen glances and timid smiles. We're now at a party and I was being accosted by this frat boy about my tatoos (i have a half sleeve and a lower back tatoo that catch the boys eyes when i sit a certain way in the library). He was trying to pick me up but failing miserably- to my surprise who should introgect into the conversation to help me- my little atlerna-teen savior. If i hadnt have been drunk i wouldnt have known what to say to him. The thing is- we had a very close mutual friend and we should have met SOoO long before this. Maybe it was better that it finally happened this way- I was really pleased with the circumstances- the liquid courage was pumping through my veins and i decided to screw the fact that i had a boyfriend and he had a girlfriend- i was kissing those shinny pink lips if it was the last thing I did. So we talked music and who knows what else until we realized 'we should get out of here' and decided to go back to hot-pants' house. And when we got to his house- wrong as it was- we kissed and kissed and kissed... Such soft sweet kisses- tenderness with a stranger is so confusing. Guys, if you really want drama in your life, treat all strange girls you make out with like your girlfriend. I broke up with my boyfriend the next day but ignored the boy i had done it because of as much as possible- hed walk one way and id turn to avoid his path. I knew i was in trouble because im not shy with people normally. Actually under normal conditions im out going to a fault. Its just that I had this huge huge crush and didnt know what to do. Halloween came around and he invited me to a party at his house. I dressed up as a kitty and wore the highest of heels and tighest of shirts I had. God was he adorable and not too long into the night I was on his lap and we were stealing kisses once again. I wanted him to be mine- all mine and then it dawned on me- hitting me like a ton of bricks... he wasnt single. SoOo wrong of me to be doing this!  In a drunken stupor I left- but not before yelling about how 'i stopped chasing boys with girlfriends a long time ago,' turning, nearly falling off the high horse id been screaming from, and marching out of his kitchen. It was our first official fight. I think it should have been seen as a bad sign that we started out by cheating- were fighting before we were dating- and I was already convinced he was the dullest boyfriend ever. But have you ever just had a feeling that you'd be missing out if you paid attention to your better judgement? Thank god I ignored what my brain was saying....
