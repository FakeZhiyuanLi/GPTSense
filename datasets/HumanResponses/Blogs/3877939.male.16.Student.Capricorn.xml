      Hola todos!  I have just returned from Mexico. Well, yesterday, but anyway....It rocked!! Lots and lots of small children running around and making amigos with you....que bien! I won't write all of it here, cause theres alot to share.&nbsp; There were, however, crazy old people that had no idea how to navigate to Chigago's O'hare airport. Good stories, and I missed out while riding in the other car. How sad.&nbsp; Hopefully, I can post some pictures of all if this good stuff sometime, hopefully in the "Pictures" section that I want to create.&nbsp; With my crafty idea of making this blog a webpage, I can do just that. We'll see.  Moving on to a slightly more phycological note, I ran across a commentary in my bible this past week that I thought would be good for sharing.&nbsp; It went something along the lines that society tells teen guys to absorb everything and not fellowship with others about feelings, problems, whatever, But that we should not pay attention to this because we are not created in the image of society, but in that of God.&nbsp; That makes a whole lot of sense, and frankly, makes me want to not be involved in society.&nbsp; Given that people make up society, I suppose thats not a living option. But avoiding societies trends....now thats thinking.  Well, thats just about all thats on my mind. Goodnight.

      Hola everyone! This is totally new, but sounds fun. Hopefully i'll pick up a few readers but who knows...? This is the result of a late night decision, so not sure where this one is going. I've never really had a 'log', for lack of a more common and manly word (meaning diary or journal I suppose...). Hope you like what comes out of here...whatever. Enjoy, if you will!    So here goes nothing....   I decide that I should go to Wal-Mart (more commonly referred to as Wally World) and that some friends should come.   After that I go to McDonalds with Chuck while taking him home and his girlfriend, Guisante, calls me and says that she has something to talk to us about, so she comes to McD's (she was also with us at wally world, just had to take Anna to a friends house so she could go to a concert. we go swimming at Guisante's, watch a movie after that (during which I keep a close eye on them...) and go home.   Goodnight.

      El Scorcho, Rock n'Roll! *BLEEP* you half-Japanese girls do it to me every time Oh, the redhead said you shred the cello And I'm jello, baby But you won't talk won't look, won't think of me I'm the epitome of Public Enemy Why you wanna go and do me like that? Come down on the street and dance with me   I'm a lot like you so please Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting I think I'd be good for you And you'd be good for me   I asked you to go to the Green Day concert You said you never heard of them How cool is that? So I went to your room and read your diary "Watching grunge leg drop New Jack through a press table" And then my heart stopped: "Listening to Cho Cho San 'fall in love all over again'."   I'm a lot like you so please Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting I think I'd be good for you And you'd be good for me   How stupid is it? I can't talk about it I gotta sing about it And make a record of my heart How stupid is it? Won't you gimme a minute? Just come up to me And say hello to my heart How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too Or maybe you just don't know what to do And maybe you're scared to say "I'm falling for you"   I wish I could get my head outta the sand 'cause I think we'd make a good team And you would keep my fingernails clean But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize 'cause I can't even look in your eyes without shakin' And I ain't fakin' I'll bring home the turkey if you bring home the bacon  I'm a lot like you so please Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting I think I'd be good for you And you'd be good for me   Ahh, what a good song! Goodnight!
