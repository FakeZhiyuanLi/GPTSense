      Well this is it. I've got to go travelling now. I've had 8 jabs, bought a rucsac and boots, plus I've started this weblog.  My official leaving date is 17 September but I'm hoping to get gardening leave so I won't have to do much more work. Don't know when that'll be, I've heard dates from the end of July to the middle of August. Who knows?!

      Well I still don't know when I'm going to be leaving work. My leaving date started as the end of July, migrated to "maybe the middle of August" and now is dependant upon when I finish an assigned task. No mean feat seeing as I'm being thwarted at every turn as I try to complete it!!  And to top it all off, I'm decorating my flat - I absolutely hate painting and all other forms of DIY. Why can't I just ride my bike instead?!

      The Streets are Number One. The only problem with this is that 'Dry Your Eyes' is just another break up, love ballad kind of affair. It's hardly representative of the album. I reckon the individual songs on the album only really work when you listen to the whole thing, hear the full story being told. The Streets aren't my favourite band in the world but I quite like the album.  But the good thing is that now the bleedin' Busted song is off Number One!!!! I hate Busted, they're just a poor excuse for a band - they seem to have 3 lead guitarists for God's sake. They epitomise everything I hate about pretend bands who simply play to the kiddy-pop market. I'd much rather listen to proper bands who make up their own minds about stuff and don't aim for the 10 year old market.

      I just got offered a contract extension until 22 October. Which is great because it'll mean that I don't have to spend my travelling money living at my Mum's house until I leave. It also means that I'll get to stay in Edinburgh for another few weeks (there may be reasons for this you know...). The only problem is that    I might actually have to do some work now!  I'm sick fed up of decorating. I've spent the last few weeks painting, filling and sanding in preparation for selling the flat. I can't put into words how much I detest DIY. I don't know how people can do this for fun. How many people do you see who spend their weekends in B&amp;Q? I've got far better things to do with my time - and far more fun things too.

      Booked my air ticket yesterday. Leaving the UK on 16 Nov for Rio. Then Sao Paulo to Bueonas Aires, Santiago to Auckland, Christchurch to Sydney, Sydney - Perth, Perth - Alice Springs, Darwin - Singapore, Bangkok - London.  I'll have to get a few internal flights in different countries and definately do some overland travel but the basis of my trip is there now. It's all becoming quite real now.

      God bless America! They've given us so much. McDonalds, for example. The right to invade another country just because we don't like the way they do things over there. The American Way.  I'm not sure if this is why I'm expected to really give a toss about completing all my work before my leaving date, for the good of the company of course. While I don't want to drop my friends in it, I could just swing the lead for another 6 weeks, take some holidays and do as little as possible. They're not going to keep me back after my leaving date are they? Some kind of perverse, grown-up detention....
