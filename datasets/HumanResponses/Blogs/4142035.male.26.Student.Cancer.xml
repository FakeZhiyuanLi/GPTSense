      1. Fill pan with ONE layer of eggs.  2. Fill pan with cold water until it just covers the eggs.  3. Bring to a rolling boil and let it boil rollingly for about 90 seconds.  4. Remove from heat and let it cool in the pan until it's cool enough to pull out an egg with your fingers.  5. Let cool on the counter until warm and not hot.  6. Eat while eggs are still warm.  Starting eggs off in cold water and then warming them up to a boil prevents cracking and also ensures that the yolks are cooked through.  The eggs continue to cook after the pan is removed from the heat but do not overcook due to some scientifical things I ain't done understood yet.  See the explanation  urlLink here  if you want.  I did this tonight.  Delectable.

      Where do dogs get their friggin' energy???  I played with my friends dog tonight and intentionally tried to tire her out.  After about 200 throws of the ball, finally, she plops down for a breather.  After a five minute nap, she's rearing to go again.  Meanwhile, I got a new case rotator cuff tendinitis.  She eats like twice a day!  If I ate twice a day, I'd just barely have enough energy to watch the ball go flying away and then to go back to sleep.  "Huh?  You threw it.  You get it."

      I hear a lot today about "If you don't support the war, you don't support the troops."  There's a lack of logic in this thinking.  I disagree with the war because of how it's been conducted and how the president has been jerking the troops around.  The troops are being abused by Executive actions to manipulate them into staying longer than they have to.  I support the troops in their fight to get home unscathed.  Their risk of being hurt or killed increases when their term of service in Iraq is extended.  I do disagree with the orders they've been given.  But I don't disagree with their willingness to follow those orders after they've sworn to protect their country and fight for what's right.  And again, because so many motivations for engaging and continuing this war are highly questionable, the troops are, at best, being ordered to fight for things that only  may  be right.  This is unacceptable.  If you are going to risk your life for something, the person who tells you to do it sure as hell better have a good reason.  The majority of the reasons are vague, full of  urlLink glittering generalities  , and are frequently just lip service to keep Americans complacent and willing to give up their   urlLink civil liberties  to defend against an overblown perception of the threat of terrorism.  This is the reason that I am not in the military and wouldn't go even if I was drafted, save the threat of an intergalactic invasion.  And I owe an unpayable debt to those who go to war in place of me who refuses to take part.  They are literally saving me from the risk of death associated with active duty during war time.  It is OK to support military personnel without supporting the war that they are fighting.  It just takes a little more thought.  And it ain't even that complicated.

      Is it just me, or are viruses and infections getting harder to fight off?  I used to have a cast-iron immune system and now it takes a solid week or two to completely rid myself of an ailment.  I'm at home right now instead of working because a cold/flue that I "got over" about a week ago has come back and now I'm vomiting phlegm in my sleep.  I'm not scared of germs.  Folks these days are way too easily spooked by the latest virus that the news has decided to report on more than once for no real reason.  Bird flu is something to avoid, but not something to freak out about.  But taking three weeks to kick a cold is, well, stupid.

      I post regularly on  urlLink drsquat.com , a forum for weight training enthusiasts, powerlifters, and athletes.  Weight-lifting folks have a bad wrap.  Mostly because the guys who are serious about it often make a lot of noise when they train, are big and scary-looking, and are  urlLink brutally strong .  Some are using steroids, some are not.  Some truly are obnoxious assholes.  But the majority are either misunderstood because of a lack of social skills or simply mistreated because people tend to judge them based on a stereotype rather than actually getting to know the person.  Hug a powerlifter.  Ask him if it's OK first, though.  If you're a   urlLink hottie , just jump the guy and hug him to death.  We don't get a whole lotta action most of the time.  Too busy lifting weights.

      Why does my  urlLink phone company  insist on calling me repeatedly in attempt to get me to buy more stuff from them when I've already procured their services?  Do they think I forgot to order part of a calling plan when I first signed up?  "Yeello."  "Hello, this is Jenny, from Qwest.  I just wanted to keep you posted on all our various exciting offers..."  "Oh, no, that's OK, I'm good."  "But wait!  We have an option here for just $80 a month that you'll want to check out!  Pay a flat fee of just an additional $80 per month and have free long distance, at any time, and from any of your phones!"  "I only have one phone."  "Well, you can use your cell phone, too."  "Cell phones are Satan's spawn and the harbinger of evil and doom to all who sign a calling plan contract."  "Uh..."  "On the other hand, sounds like a good idea.  I'll take it."  I want to know how many people actually buy more services from their phone company when their phone company calls them, even though they've already signed up for the services they want.  It must be a pretty big number, considering all the junk phone calls I get.  Here's a more accurate translation of the above conversation...  "Yeello."  "Hi, this is Annoying, Phony, Wanna-Be Perky Pants Even Though I Hate My Job And I Hate You, from Quest.  I want to sell you more stuff despite the fact that you don't need it.  Also, we have some, quote-unquote, deals we'd like to offer you where we say that you save money by buying a particular service that actually costs more than what you're paying now and pawnning it off as a  urlLink bargain  because it costs less than the other services we advertise purposely at a higher cost in order to manipulate you into buying the one we've presented as being some sort of savings opportunity."  "Fuck off."  "Fuck you, too, sir.  And thank you for using Qwest."  The least people could do is be honest.

      OK, time for Derrick's totally unrealistic aspirations for the world.  Let's just stop with the whole  urlLink war  thing.  Is it not getting frickin' played out?  Thousands and thousands of years of killing and torture and anguish at our own hands.  I often thought of what would happen if everyone just refused to fight.  Know what would happen?  My guess is that the leaders of countries at war would either be forced to find another solution to their conflicts, or at least those who wage war or terrorize other coaters would become completely impotent.  What if everyone put down their gun, stepped away from the command console, and put the cap back on the big red buttons they push to set off all them great big ol'  urlLink WOMD's  and just said "Nope.  Not gonna do it.  Not this time.  No, you're nevah gonna git it."  America, the strongest country in the world, is declaring war on other countries?   It's the strongest country in the world.   Is it really necessary to blow other countries up to get things we want?  Is it even necessary to wage war to just effect some sort of world-wide foreign policy?  No way.  We're fucking America.  Not only should we be helping other countries maintain peace; we should be setting an example of peace to the world by not propagating the farce of "freedom fighting."   Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity. -Saw it on a bumpersticker

      Saw Fahrenheit 9/11 today.  A total anti-Bush propaganda film.  The movie was set up to show Bush at his absolute worst.  But the info in the movie also spoke for itself.  I used to think that Bush was down-right evil.  After seeing the film, I think he's more just inexperienced and a little afraid to do what he thinks is right.  I actually think that, with more experience in politics and less presidential coaching from his dad, he could have been a mediocre president.  But that's all oil under the bridge now.

      A very good friend of mine with loads more experience in teaching English as a second language gave me some reasons on the importance of teaching people how to use a VCR in America.  To the best of my understanding, English and American life skills need to be taught through the English language, which is the whole point of ESL (as opposed to teaching EFL, English as a Foreign Language). Thusly, separate testing, state regulated or not, is needed to make sure that students are understanding the American environment by way of American English. This is the difference between teaching a language through translation and teaching a language through concepts that are shaped by the language itself.  An example might be the way Spanish speakers refer to things that they like. English speakers will say "I like this." Spanish speakers say "Este me gusta," or literally, "This pleases me." This shapes attitudes by expressing how things serve us to our liking, or how things contribute to our own good. The difference is subtle but powerful in that syntax can help to express either our need for things to serve our desires or our appreciation pf things that serve our desires.   Apologia:   Have separate classes for life skills. Or, have classes that teach both. I'm guessing that these classes exist but my lack of experience leaves me ignorant. Obviously, in either case, there is a lack of congruence between state mandated testing and what is actually taught in ESL classes in this state.

      Pro 1: The juices collect in the middle of the cupped beef instead of running off into the pan to be fried into oblivion. Later, collected beef juice can be poured over your sweet potatoes. Good times.  Con 1: The juices don't get to the pan, which means that you don't get that cake of black, burnt meet juice on the bottom of the pan, which I like to scrap off the pan with a spatula and eat. Gross? Yes. Possibly a cancer risk? Sure. Absolutely delectable? Absolutely.  Con 1 Remedy: Pour the juices out of the beef cup, into the pan.  Con 2: The medallion cooks unevenly.  Con 2 Remedy: The bacon press now is applicable to more than pork products.  Con 3: Beef should be flat.  Con 3 Remedy: Celebrate diversity.

      I have been seriously weight training and competing in the sport of Powerlifting for about 7 years. Recently, the father of one of the greatest lightweights in the history of the sport, Rickey Dale Crain, has died. My best wishes to his father's survivers.  Below is a cut and paste from Drsquat.com, at  urlLink http://www.drsquat.com/index.cfm?action=viewtopic&amp;forumID=2&rootthreadID=146735&amp;context=11 , which was taken from Goheavy.com's forum board.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Donald Neil Crain 1927-2004 My memories of my father, Donald Neil Crain 1927 - 2004  His love for weightlifting as a teenager in the early 40â€™s started in the small town of Clayton, Ok. His love later turned to a passion that stayed with him his entire life. It was fueled by reading all the weightlifting magazines and along with Dink Dollens, his childhood best friend, they trained constantly to get as big and strong as all the guys in the magazines. Dink carried his passion on to become the first Oklahoma bodybuilding champion in 1951.  He joined the Coast Guard after a year of college at O.U. and his passion for weightlifting continued to grow. His buddy, Pete Moale, and he traveled to York, Pa., the eastern mecca of Bodybuilding and Olympiclifting. He watched and visited with all the great bodybuilders and members of the U.S. Olympic lifting team that trained under Bob Hoffman at the York Barbell Club. While there, he bought a small weight bar and two 50 lb. plates. This became his traveling gym for the next few years for Pete and him, as they traveled in the Coast Guard. Making it all the way to Anchorage, Alaska, training on their Coast Guard Cutter, you could tell he was serious.  After getting out of the service, he returned and graduated from the University of Oklahoma. Playing trumpet in the marching band and going to the Cotton Bowl was indeed one of the highlights while attending O.U.  After graduation, he married Mary Nell James of his hometown. Everywhere they moved he trained. He sought out the best places to get serious with the iron. First the San Antonio YMCA, then the Phoenix YMCA, Berkeley YMCA, Denver YMCA, his own small gym in Colorado Springs (the first real gym there), Rapid City YMCA and full circle back to Oklahoma at the Shawnee YMCA; and the past number of years his own home gym in Clayton. Each place is a story in itself. Training with and getting to know, some of the better Bodybuilders, Powerlifters and Olympiclifters in the country. He had a few favorites and always had a story about each of them. Paul Anderson, John Grimek, Steve Reeves, Bill Pearl, Dave Draper, Tommy Kono, Sergio Oliva were just among a few of his idols.  I can remember when he used to take my brother and I to the Berkeley YMCA on Saturdays. We would do all three Olympic lifts and all three powerlifts; then it was off to get our weekly Nutty Buddy ice cream for our reward (and even if the workout was not a good one, we still got it-and all for 12 cents). One time at the Berkeley YMCA my brother and I were misbehaving after a workout and after several warnings he pulled out his weightlifting belt and gave us each a spanking (we never did that again). Sometimes he would take us to the park and he would get other kids in the park to race us, most of the times we would win. This helped us both to be better athletes in high school. He was very adamant to show coaches in the 60's how weight training would make you faster, and not to believe the rumours of the stereotype muscle-bound ideas floating around and being taught. And he was successful.  He was an IPF Master World Record holder in his own right and his legacy included the only brother-sister IPF World Champions ever, Rickey Dale Crain and Gayla Crain In the early 1980's all 3 Crain's held IPF World Records at the same time; This has "never" been duplicated. Randy Lee Crain, was a state and regional powerlifting champion and Mr Wyoming in bodybuilding. Rickey Dale's son, Rickey Lee and daughter, Samantha Jo, both became youth national and world champions. CRAIN was their name and IRON was their game.  He wrote many articles and sent in many pictures and results for numerous magazines, Strength and Health, Muscular Development, Iron Man, Lifting News, Powerlifting News and PLUSA. He was an IPF International Referee in Powerlifting, an AAU National Referee in Bodybuilding and Olympiclifting. He was involved with all aspects of the Iron games. In the 40 years I competed, he attended and coached me at almost every powerlifting meet, always offering encouragement and advice.  In each place he lived he left a legacy of friends and champions in the Iron game. You know who you are and what he did for you guys. Even though his master lifts at 165 pounds of 490 squat, 380 bench press and 580 deadlift were pretty spectacular lifts, he was more famous for coaching all of his world class children as they lifted. Weightlifting was just the common bond he would use. Once he shared your interest in weightlifting, he would then share his faith in Jesus Christ. Many believers are scattered around the country because of his servant hood to the Lord. God, family and weights were his 3 loves in life and he always kept them in the proper order. He was a loving father and a devoted husband without question. He pushed us to the limits to succeed and we did. His influences on my life, his familyâ€™s lives and his friendâ€™s lives will be felt for many years to come. Truly his last wish would be that not a single person he knew would leave this life without knowing Jesus Christ as their Savior. That was what he lived for and what made him happy.He taught all of his kids to have a serious commitment for God through not only their lifting but their music and reading of the WORD. He took education seriously (He graduated from high school at age 16) and produced a legacy of children and granchildren who all have college degrees.  He was my father; he was my mentor; he was my inspiration and spiritual guide. I miss you dad. I miss you so much it hurts. I have cried for many days and will for many more to come. As Jesus said to the thief on the cross, "Today you will be with me in paradise." Dad, you are in paradise right now with Jesus. And someday I will be in paradise with you kneeling and worshipping at the feet of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  Bye Dad, Your Son, Rickey Dale Crain

      What's the big friggin' deal???  I've heard all kinds of arguments against gay marriage. A child needs both a father figure and a mother figure. Gays aren't able to love each other like straight folks, so they can't offer a child the same love a straight couple could. Marriage is a heterosexual institution, and them homos are edgin' in on our territory!!!  And my personal favorite: They're just getting married for the TAX BREAKS! What kind of freakin' idiot would dedicate him/herself to another individual and work to live out the rest of their days with them just to get a fucking tax break? The pay off is not worth the effort! Even the supposedly morally-devoid gay population of the world knows that. And if certain gay folks DO get married for the tax breaks, I doubt the validity of their existence.  When are people going to drop this? Here's my argument: Homosexuality isn't the problem. Marriage is. Marriage is a great example of government support of the crossing of church and state, which is a big no-no in America. And the religious ritual of marriage is encouraged by financial support from the state to the married. There are other ways to support people who want to have families or be married.  Derrick declares: from this day on, there will no more marriages! (note: not official law in the United States)

      I don't know about other guys in their 20's, but the libido causes some problems. First, the good stuff:  1. Erections are neither difficult to establish nor maintain, and frequently occur for no obvious reason at all.  2. Sex is pretty easy to get. Just go to sleep.  3. Being in shape is almost automatic as long as you eat decently and stay away from the Segway Human Transporter.  The challenges:  1. Getting along with women is difficult when you're pretty much willing to have sex with anyone born with a vagina (or who has a surgically placed one. Whatever floats your boat). Consequently, conversations with women are either hard to follow because of various distractions, or it's awkward because the sexual energy is hard to temporarily turn off.  2. High testosterone makes sleeping difficult.  3. One of the reasons I like older women is because their drive is more on level with mine, but a lot of them have finally given up on game playing. On the other hand, getting them to take you seriously is a challenge. Or, they are attracted to you, but are not available to you because they buy into the stigma of dating someone much younger than them.  4. The majority of guys my age are still emotionally 12 years old. Gives guys with half a brain a bad name. And makes having legitimate guy friends a bit of a challenge sometimes.  5. I do enjoy the company of women in non-sexual contexts. But having your libido constantly set to warp 9 interferes constantly. Professional and platonic interactions are always at risk for becoming sexual in one way or another.

      What the fuck is this  urlLink shit ?  Doesn't anybody just take a freakin' walk any more? If things keep going this way, people are going to end up dependent on these things to get around. Everyone scooting around on Segways and Lark scooters because their legs don't work right anymore.  America is the fattest, laziest and most spoiled country in the world. Wonderful country in many respects. But people need to get off their asses and go jogging.

      Why on Earth is everything set up backwards? All the foods that are good for you taste horrible. All the really good-tasting foods are horrible for your health. Doing good for the world takes a helluva lot of work. Being good to people runs the risk of being taken advantage of.  Wouldn't it make more sense to have things be  easy  to do when they're also the best thing to do? What gives?  There is no God.

       urlLink http://www.japantoday.com/e/?content=news&cat=4&amp;id=307692   What exactly is a "suspicious traveler" anyway? Makes me think of the term "domestic partner" or "person of color."  From Webster's  Domestic: 2 : of, relating to, or originating within a country and especially one's own country   3 : of or relating to the household or the family : devoted to home duties and pleasures  Partner: 2 a : one associated with another especially in an action :  urlLink ASSOCIATE ,  urlLink COLLEAGUE  b : either of two persons who dance together c : one of two or more persons who play together in a game against an opposing side 3 : either of two people living together; especially :  urlLink SPOUSE 3 : a member of a  urlLink partnership ; also 4 such memberships : one of the heavy timbers that strengthen a ship's deck to support a mast -- usually used in plural  So, if I live with someone, that would mean that I am that person's domestic partner. Though I have always been pretty sure of my heterosexuality. Also, a straight man and woman are domestic partners. But none of the stuff in Webster's Online Dictionary suggestions anything related to gayness.  Suspicious:1 : tending to arouse  urlLink suspicion  :  urlLink QUESTIONABLE 2 : disposed to suspect :  urlLink DISTRUSTFUL   3 : expressing or indicative of  urlLink suspicion     Traveler: 1 : one that  urlLink travels  : as a : one that goes on a trip or journey b :  urlLink TRAVELING SALESMAN 2 a : an iron ring sliding along a rope, bar, or rod of a ship b : a rod on the deck on which such a ring slides3 : any of various devices for handling something that is being transported laterally.  I see. So they're talking about those untrustworthy containers used to move things around to and from various places.  Just the phrase "suspicious traveler" makes it so you can pretty much attack any body who moves around and doesn't look right to you. Just like the word "terrorist."  Let's hear it for persecution!

      You wouldn't believe what Washington State BOE puts these ESL students through twice a quarter. They have to take these "life skills" language tests. They're tested on things like what "FF" means on a VCR, what day the abbreviated "Thurs" corresponds to on a calendar. Shit like that. And the higher the language level, the harder the test. There are 10 levels of intro ESL classes before you can take English 101. For the higher level students, they gotta know what it means when their medication bottles say "Take one pill by mouth, twice daily" and even tougher things like reading an analogue clock. Twice a quarter, they have to take these TWO HOUR tests, once in the beginning and once toward the end of the course. And they have no effect on their grade or placement into future classes. However, if students, overall, are not passing the tests adequately, the state can sanction the school. The lady who I am volunteering under doesn't even teach the material.  "Welcome to education," she says.  I have very little patience for that kind of crap. More tolerance will come with experience, I assume. But damn. What a jerk-off session tonight's class was. Most of them couldn't even figure out where to put their name because they use fuckin' scantrons for the damn tests.  If the state really wanted students to learn how to use a VCR or how to read a the directions on a prescription med bottle, they should make a multi-lingual book and give it to them at the beginning of the quarter. There. Problem solved. In the four hours per quarter that students have to take these ridiculous, asinine, pointless exams, they could be taught enough English to do all the things that the test wants them to do. Or, they could (gasp!)  figure it out for themselves.  Or even (no!) ask somebody they know! But no, that would be WAY too rational an approach for the educational administrators in the this state. And, as George Carlin said in his lecture about the impossibility by eliminating sex crimes by simply outlawing religion,"We don't have time for rational solutions."

      I don't know about this whole 8-hour day thing. I finish work and I'm too friggin' tired to do anything. In college, all my professors and advisors stamped into me the importance of doing something I love. Now I know why: cause when you're finished working for the day, you ain't gonna be doing anything else!!!  Thank the powers that be that I'm motivated enough to pursue a career that I care about. There is no chance in hell that I could live out the rest of my days as an office assistant.  There. Content.
