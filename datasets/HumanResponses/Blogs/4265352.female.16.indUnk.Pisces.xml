       yeah that may sound extremely corny, but it's from my favorite broadway musical "RENT." good good GOOD show. the best. it's from "seasons of love." i have been listening to this song NONSTOP all day (except for the 4 hours i was at drama) but other than that, it's been on all day. i love it.      i am slowly starting to remember why i am an actor and singer.   i am slowly starting to remember why i love the stage so much.   and how bad i really do want it in life.      that may sound corny as well, but it's so true. there is something about it that is so....LIBERATING.      i wouldnt say that i'm happy...i'm a long way from happy...   but i'm in a good mood right now.       i am talking to david about how we're "getting back together" lol and we're gonna raise llamas to have kinky sex. horny llama farms. hahaha.      i'm in a rare mood. i say "rare" and not "weird" because this hardly ever happens...but i dont see it as weird.   i'm in a - philisophical - mood?   i dont know if its the right word.       i can't really talk right now though...i'm in la la land....see what broadway does to you?   i love emory.   i love matt.   i love david.   i love sally.   i love winny.   i love ryan.   i love reanna.   i love cory.   i love ciara.   i love christie.   i love you all...       525,600 minutes 525,000 moments so dear. 525,600 minutes how do you measure a year?

       that is what matt told me. i am past the retarded stage but not completely to the point yet where they yell for that patty wagon and want to put me in a straight jacket.       it's cuz i told him if i were to drive to his house without directions i would probably end up somewhere in canada. he said if i drive straight east and end up in canada, somethings GOT to be fucked up.      if you didn't already know, or perhaps are simply just retarded because you CAN'T READ the "about me" portion of this whole thing, i am completely in love with dashboard confessional.    one of my favorite songs is  THE PLACES YOU HAVE COME TO FEAR THE MOST .      "you can't fake ir hard enough to please, everyone, or anyone at all..."      and i can NOT fake it that well. i may put on a facade. because i hear it all the time.      "you're fine. you're a teenager. you're SUPPOSED to go through this..."   i am...?   since when...?      tell me when YOU lost all of your friends because of conformity?   tell me when YOU had someone tell you that you deserved every bit of pain they put you through?   has an entire group of people ever made u feel like u dont deserve to live?   have they told you that you are worthless?      i wake up every morning to a constant reminder of what i don't have...and what i never will have...      "and the grave that you refuse to leave, the refuge that you built to flee, the places you have come to fear the most, it's the place that you have come to fear that most..."      the world needs more people like matt. yes matt. i love matt. he is my hero. no one can make me laugh quite like he can.      the world needs more people like sally. sally can put fun into anything.      the world needs more people like winny. not many people understands like she does.      the world needs more people....like every person i have ever turnt to...and by that i mean every person i met this summer.   i would die for you all.   i would give anything to spend forever with you guys.      the world needs more people like emory...    beautiful, soft eyed, caring, funny, wonderful people like emory...    ...i need more people like emory in my world...but i will settle for the original.   i dont like knock offs.    i want him.      the boogie man lives in mine and matts closets...mine irons my clothes...matts burns em for fire and make him get supplies for smores...me and that boogie man are gonna have a duel for the closet when i get there...    DIE BOOGIE!!!

       we've decided that everyone in LCP has ADD: advanced drama disorder.   we were sitting there today discussing our first performance, and all of a sudden breanna and aaron were fighting over a tennis ball.      20 minutes later...   a shoe went flying across the theater...   makes you wonder why MORE people aren't in drama...      we're finally getting somewhere though: we have a skit to do friday morning for the frosh. yah fun.      i got my schedule today.   english with burhman, LCP, history with taitano, art with yori, algebra with deruse, chem with rice...   at least i didnt get moses. that old asshole. all i did in that class was text brad....anywho...      i have started formulating my "dillenger escape plan" and i found today that it will cost quite a lovely chunk of change. this is bad news...      however...      i get to live with winny...next to ludacris...thats right bitches...fuck you.   also...chrissy and i are moving to - thats right -  CANADIA        ..............eh?.............

       a stand still romance. yet there's no sure way to be so true. no sure way to stop from falling into you. no sure way to know that you play your words so well. pick them wisely, not a soul to tell. perhaps who knows what's going on tonight. i see another facade of myself putting up a useless fight. useless to be that this could be real. useless to be that i couldn't feel. a stand still romance in my eyes you are. i shake my head in a pitiful attempt to not think that far. a stop and go feeling is whats going on. nothing to stand still for nothing to linger on. a broken view of everything she could have here. and a stand still vision of everything that there is to fear.        i love a boy from texas...        apparently there's this thing called distance.    apparently there's this thing called being hurt.   not being able to trust again when someone says "i love you."      apparently, they tell me  i need you...

         all hail mr. leo mcbride, for he is the shit.         i am extremely bored right now, for there is not one thing to do. damn.   matt left me. to go to bed or something. it's only 3 am in DC. he can make it another hour or 2...Winny is sleeping she has soccer tryouts tomorrow...emory is in germany...sally is grounded and god knows where the hell ryan is. holly is sleeping as well. bastards. suck it up and drink some coffee.      so i have this thing for LCP (learning curve productions) all this week at school. we thought it was supposed to be fun. barrett and i have found that to be just a tad bit short of true. we just kinda of sit...while he yells...it's entertaining though.      i have directions on how to get to washington DC for my "dillenger escape plan" and i plan on stopping in nebraska to pick up some rocks and a stuffed jack rabbit. stuffed for safty percautions of course. i love matt. he is my god of fuck.      i have decided that this escape plan of which i speak will go through sometime soon if i stay here. i do not like it here. i wake up everyday knowing that when i look at everything in this world some like to call "home" i am reminded of everything that has been fucked up for me. i hate you people. if you are my friend, you know it. if not, suck on this. i really wish i could also move to DC...or Texas...or Miami...i just want to be with the person i love...      ooh...and i have a new crush...but i won't tell...    C'MON...  you really can't be THAT stupid?
