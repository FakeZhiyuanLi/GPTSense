      So I did more than I expected yesterday. I actually managed to shower, wash my hair, and met some work friends for a late afternoon of much-needed beautification. Luckily, there were summer associates there, so I got a manicure, pedicure and eyebrow wax all on the firm (gotta love tax write offs). It felt good to get out of the house and talk to human beings who were not obsessed with the duhig doctrine or holders in due course. I also had alcohol for the first time since May--needless to say this morning is all about the headache.  So now I get to spend the days between now and September 13th vacationing and getting ready to start work, then the days from September 13 to November 5 working while anticipating the bar results. I actually think I passed, and feel better about it as the days go by.  I've got to get used to this blogging thing, I'm gonna go catch up on months of missed sleep now, but I may blog later!  Until next time, -Carliss

      So the best way to describe the day is quasi-comatose--I move from the bed and end up right back in it.  I know there's food somewhere in this place, but I'm far too lazy to retrieve it.  A shower will be nice too. I'm gonna go pass out now, maybe I'll blog more later.  I have no idea what to do with my new found, short-lived freedom!

      So I survived 3 days of hell and have emerged pretty much in tact.&nbsp; I'm not sure how my stomach and muscles are going to be affected in the long run, or if I've started a chain of reaction that will result in a death from an anurism and/or heart attack at 40.&nbsp; Either way, I'm never doing this again.&nbsp;   The only thing more cruel and unusual (I'd file a habeas petition, but I don't think it counted as custody, and my claim would now be moot or unripe) than the exam itself were the instructions.&nbsp; Imagine this: 800 type A personalities who've been studying for months for an exam that will determine the fate of their lives in a room, sleep deprived at an ungodly hour.&nbsp; Now ask these people, some high on caffeine and others on illegal substances to spend 15-20 minutes listening to instructions printed on all of the study materials they have memorized for the past months and wait while all that information slowly (or so they believe) leaks out of their brains.&nbsp; Then tell those people that for an additional 30 minutes after actual testing begins, they will not be allowed to move, come hell, high water, anxious diahrea or the urge to vomit.&nbsp;   I'm amazed I made it through the experience without ending up in a padded room.&nbsp; I guess tomorrow I'll start giving my random commentary and musings on life.&nbsp; For now, I'm slipping into a coma (partially natural, partially drug and/or alcohol induced).   Until next time...

      So, I'm taking the first day of the Texas Bar tomorrow, and ironically I'm not nervous at all.&nbsp; I spent the day resting and doing some last minute reviewing.&nbsp; I neurotically organized my office supplies, and planned my route to the testing center.&nbsp; It's been a trying experience--I cry randomly, have moments where&nbsp;I feel brilliant and others where I feel like a total idiot.&nbsp; But at least I've survived so far, and I have vowed that I will NEVER do it again.

      Ironically, my first entry is two days before the Texas Bar Exam.&nbsp; So obviously, I don't have much to say. I'll post later to let you know if I survived the three days of misery.

      From my great friend Stanley:  Oh, did you hear? 'Method and Red' might be cancelled due to low ratings.  Clutch the pearls, Carliss. I'm shock n' awed.  ...and from Daria:   For some reason, i continue to opt for honesty (despite mounting evidence that it's inexoriably turning me into an old woman alone in a one-room apartment filled with 30-year old newspapers and cats).

          That being said, I just don't see how John Edwards is "sexy." Obviously, he's a lot more attractive than Bush and Cheney, but who isn't (OK, John McCain, but who else)? If John Edwards is sexy, I now understand why Republican wives all have that "special" look which some refer to as "a hot mess" and others refer to as "ugly". Clearly politicians and the people who work with the them and love them have blinders on.

      As my cousin is getting ready for her first day of school next week, I have had the most profound revelation--I never have to go to school again!!!  It's so exciting.  I got a flyer in the mail for discounts at the bookstore, and it was so refreshing to know that I don't need to make room in my budget for books.  Unfortunately, my glee was dashed by a letter about the interest on my Perkins loan, as I suddenly realized that the last 7 years of education haven't been paid for yet.  I now realize I should have tried that whole "living like a graduate student" thing they told us about the first day of law school.  Oh well, at least I have some great clothes and sheets to show for it (and lots of useless books, of course).

      Don't you just love it when you make a to do list, the day's half gone, and you've done none of it?  It's the "story of my life" at least recently.   It's hard to do even the most mundane hygenic tasks, so I have to add them to the list--which usually means I don't do them.  For example, this morning, as I lay in bed watching  Cybill  on Oxygen and realized that Karen Walker on  Will and Grace   is just a knock off of Cybill and Mary-Ann, I had to say to myself "1. eat breakfast; 2. take vitamins; 3. brush teeth; 4. shower at some point today, cause I don't think you did it yesterday, but you probably did on Saturday, since you went to that wedding; 5. switch pajamas, or maybe put on work out clothes to fool people into thinking you went and/or are going to the gym."

            So I didn't manage to start smoking cause my mom was out of cigarettes.  Guess I'll have to find another way to shorten my life expectancy.   It's amazing how fast time passes when you really don't have much to do, and how easy it is to occupy almost every moment of your time. I had such lavish plans for catching up on reading, cleaning, doing laundry, cooking, etc.... only to end up running around most of the weekend. On Saturday I went to a wedding that was sweet but had an extensive bridal party--35 NOT including the bride and groom. I actually felt sorry for the bride because she had to coordinate all that. I also did some grocery shopping and cooking. I never realized how hard it is to be truly domestic full time, while attempting to run all the other errands and stuff on your plate. It almost seems easier to do a half-ass job in your spare time. Maybe because it just seems more special when home-cooking is rare.  I'm feeling better overall these days, maybe it's the drugs. Don't worry, they're legal. I actually had a conversation the other day with some people I will be working with in the future about how none of us have ever used illegal drugs and how it makes us very lame and quasi-republican (or maybe democrats, since now republicans admit to using drugs, but whatever). I feel like I am one of the last 20 somethings on earth who have never smoked a joint. I'd try it, but I'm afraid that I'll have an asthma attack and die.

      ...and I haven't done much of anything except complain and take some psychiatric drugs to get over my "the bar really sucked and so does my life" state of mind.  I did do some shopping on Thursday--all gift certificates and suits for work--so no fun.  I wish i was independently wealthy.  I spent a big part of today in a xanax induced coma. I also spent a day pissed off cause my New York trip fell through.  But now i'm going to chicago.  Whatever.  I've decided I'm going to start smoking.  Because i want to be supported by the government in my later years, and I'd rather die of lung cancer than a stroke.

      So I spent yesterday being very domestic--cooking, cleaning, grocery and other shopping, etc....  It's amazing how it's nice to do the basic things when you haven't been able to for months.  I'm slowly easing into a relaxation pattern, even though  my to do list is a mile long.  However, I've decided that at the top of the list is catching up on my Tivo and Netflix, and working out.  I might also read if my brain can work its way up to it.   I must say that I'm very happy that I didn't start my bar travels immediately.  I'm still recovering physically and emotionally.  It's hard to believe this time last week I was hyperventilating and sleepless, and now the nightmare is over.
