        I'm in such a bad mood today. I hate it. I hate today. I just hate it when a nobody is trying a somebody. I've been in SGS since pra-sekolah. I actually liked it then but I'm starting to hate it this year. I'm not saying the school sucks. I'm just saying the community that makes the school sucks. I'm not saying anyone in particular but everyone is just following what the other person does. It just gets on my nerves. There's this particular person who really steps it. Shit. I hate him. No, it's not Binoy.   Gosh and there's Miss Bheng. What the hell is her problem ?!! When I steped in the class, she was already looking at me like shit. Askin me to wait outside until she finished her "speech". watever man. Calling me a bad influenece in front of my face. Sheesh. If I was a bad influence, why make me the freakin monitor ?! And what's with her accent ? Bloody wannabe British.   And somebody in my class, it doesn't mean you're get good grades and is good in sports, that you can boss people around. sheesh. And those wannabe some rap stars girlfriend. WTH ?!! And that group, sing sing sing only, your voice so horrible still wanna sing. Think you're one of the originals but you are  NOT . And what's with the cock touching and the alubas. crap man. and the Muhammad Ali teacher is so biased. I got a reason why. I'm not gonna tell it here cause someone might snich on me here.  I just wanna shout out loud man. I should put a password on this site so I can say what I wanna say. Don't hate me because you  THINK  its you.

         The best day of my life. Feel so colourful   Saturday was the funniest day of my life. And the funniest. It all began after church. Rachael came to church with me. Wow. You should have seen her hair. PINK. My goodness. I was like "What happened to your hair?!" when she came to my house before church. But that's not the funny part. Yea, after church we were telling jokes in the car. I don't think she can tell jokes very well. Not good. INDIAN AIR. haha. Then droped her off at Kuilap.   Then I went to Gadong. I msged Fiz she asked me to go to the old coffee bean. And I was at McD. Lucky not that far. So yea anyway, I think i had a stalker. Shit man. I was at the dark alleyway. then the dustbin fell and made like a weird sound and then I got a miss call from someone I don't even know. Then when I reached the place. Fiz, Clinton, Watson, Larrie, Jasper and Chun were there already. When I came, Clinton said "Ey, Motorcycle boy". Ahaha. Oh. There's a story behind that name. Then I ordered fries. Everyone else food came earlier. Then I'm like how long does it take to make fries ? Then I said to the waitress "Um, Can you check my fries?" Then Wei Chun started laughing. Shit. Not that funny la. Fiz, Serves her rite. Hahah. Remember. Then my fries came and everyone was already done eating. celaka. Then I asked for sauce like very rude. haha. I'm so spoiled. After&nbsp;that we went to the mall, met up with Ade, Rach, Eddie his friends. then more people come. whee~ Vk, Ronald, Raynal, Heng Lee and the rest came. So we were basically there for a while, talking to everyone we met. So cool. Like just talkt o anyone who passes you. Then we the original people we came with, went to Rigs. I didn't play tho. Just kacau. On the way to rigs, Fiz was telling me the she was afraid to walk in the dark parts cause she got stalked and molested once. I was laughing my arse off. But I'm nice. Chun is such a pokleng. "Yo wazzap my nigga". Yea, in Rigs Fiz was telling me that we need to meet Joo. So when Vanessa came in I asked her. So off we went to find him. We were searching for him for abou 30 minutes. On the way, we saw Siew and both of us were like "omg" after she want to follow. So we quick walk. past them. shuushh. In searching, both of us really needed to pee. I went to Centerpoint to pee. Babes didn't want to pee cause she was scared. Ahaha. Then, we went to the mall and met up with Ade they all. We jalan jalan for a while. Then we went outside. The Vanessa, Joo, Randy, Natasha and all the F5 people came. Then after that Wei Chun came. So it's the big group thing going on again. We were outside for awhile making few calls. Then we went we went in. Now most of us has already left. So it was Fiz, Joo, Chun, Eddie, Ade and me. We were outside of the ticket booth. Laughing our arses off. I tell you. Not like your ordinary laugh. This laugh was like hurt your stomach but you cant stop. We kept laughin for like ages. Shit. The whole mall could hear us. But what we laugh about was a secret.  Flat arse and big mouth.  AHAHA. OMG. HUGE MOUTH. =O. That was me and Chun's funniest moments. AHHA. Then we went to the food court which was completely empty. Cool. I think we were the only few people in the mall. Then our last minute decision. We went to watch movie. We got tickets from Carrie. In CINEMA 4 . Shit. Fiz scared the shit out of me. That was the cinema with the ghostt. OoOoo~ In the cinema, me and Chun were shouting. ahaha. Funny arse. Since we were the only 2 who watched it already, we laughed at the known funny parts. AhAH. After the movie, when we were going down, at the main entrace there was this shop rite. So many manicans. We looked at them rite. Then Chun BoO'ed me. Scared the shit out of me. Ahaha. So i ran out of the mall like in a rush. Freak. Then Chee Ming, Jin Ping and William came to pick Chun up. they waited for us to go home first. Nice rite. So yea. Came back bout 3. Forgot the rest. Go to   urlLink  here   ,   urlLink  here   &nbsp;and   urlLink  here   &nbsp;for the rest. ahaha. Ciouz.   NIGGA PLEAZE

I'm gonna try the sex thing soon. So yea. At Gadong, empty. Went at bout 11.30. Met with my sis. She went with "her" friends. Yea. Me and Han went around the food court. He hasnt seen the mall in like 5 months since he came back from Australia. Yea. Joo is back too. whheee~ Yea. Nothin much to say bout gadong that saturday night. came back bout 2 in the morning. We all slept in the same room cause Han slept over. We were makin stupid jokes. "You want some Prawns ?", "You just realised you ass was yellow?" HAAHAH. SO FUNNY. Didnt sleep at all cause laughing too much. So cool to see a sunrise. Like noone else is awake but you. So peaceful. Then went to somewhere near Gadong for breakfast. The lunch 10 minutes after breakfast. So hungry. Spent the whole Sunday "workin" in Gadong. Then went to the airport for dinner. Came back bout 9. Nothin to do there. Now online. Bah, here's the pictures.        Me and my sis at the airport. stupid pic.        We were bored in the plane so we compared your eyes. Mine nicer rite. Greennn..        At Fuji. The Japanese restaurent.        Ahaha. Stupid random thing. Linkin park was in Bangkok too. :P         On the huge chair in the giant house thing.        In the boat thing. It's like bumper cars on water. And the boat thing has a motor. So cool. So fast too.        In snow city. So cold. The giant snow man was so cool.           Another snow man picture. Just closer and my eyes were closed.           At the ginger bread house thing in snow city. It was fun in snow city.  Throwing snowballs and stuff.           Our swimming pool at Pattaya resort. So cool. The hotel had it's own  amusement park and a monorail. Like Jerudong park at the back of the hotel. It was so huge man. All the pics of the pool and stuff were taken from the SO BLODDY high restaurant. We were on the 60th floor. Scared me man. Then we went to the roof of that building which was 4 more floors up. So windy up there. You could see everything. So nice.    &nbsp;        Another angle of the pool. The rollercoaster and part of the giant drop is  there too.   On our last night in Pattaya. We went to the gay show. Seriously. They looked  like real girls but they were guys. The pics here. ALL of them are guys ok.         &nbsp;

        I'm going to be nice to everyone today because I'm gonna be in a bad mood tomorrow. Tomorrow is open day. My parents are going to meet my teachers. I'm so damn scared. Miss Bheng didn't give our whole class our report books back. Maybe she wants to see all our parents. I think I will get bombed tomorrow. Tonight I will lecture my parents about tomorrow.  Anywayz, today I didn't shout at anyone. I didn't scold anyone. I'm nice. I think I'm in the mood to create a new layout.  Well, Gladys leave this site already. I'm gonna find a new blogging partner. I don't like blogging alone.  Oh Shit. I just remembered. Binoy wants to see my parents.

         I feel so pathetic. I've been sleeping really late and waking up between the times of 2 and 4. Yesterday I woke up at 4. Gosh man. I think this will be another emosi blog. uh oh. =) Yea, talk about enthusiasm.      I don't like people who think that because they're fans of Simple Plan or D12 or watever, it  makes them punk rockers. watever. And I don't like people who just try to fit in but they just can't. Just like following a group around, just to be seen by people. Then coming back to class and telling everyone about the adventures when, clearly the group NEVER talked to them. They are just like tails. Moving on. OH. AND there is akademi fantasia people in friendster. SO AMAZING.  AHAHA. SHOCK ME.

WHHEEE~  oK. My day yesterday, I got up at about 7. Then I got to school. When I got out of the car, Irish and few other people shouted across the street Happy Birthday. In people were ahah. HORNY. >=) Didnt learn much in school. Was laughing my head off. After school, I went home. Was suppose to go to Escapade but no jadi. Kasian. So I went online. Then the net was starting to get boring. So, I think I played the piano from 3 to 6. Woah. So long. I got bathed, changed and stuff. Then I went to the Gala night a bit late. Clinton met up with us at the lobby to get his ticket. We went up. Err. Got a bit a hold up at the reception. We got to our table. Then got out. then got in. Stupid no? Then we went to talk to  urlLink Yan . Then when we got in they were singing the National Anthem already. So like we pretended to stand still yet we were walking. I dunno how to explain it but time went really fast. By the time I was concious, it was disco time. Didnt really want to dance so curi curi go to  Mall. Talking bout ghost and stuff. So takut to go to the toilet cause scared of Lady Gadong. Dont know why I think this shit is true. I dont believe in ghost but I dont know why I belive this. Yea. We went to Coffeezone while everyone was in Centerpoint. Away from the crowd. And SOME people thought the crowd was cool. Oh watever. Running to the dance floor when they danced like retarded people. Yea, since I didnt get a cake. They got me a cake. So sweet no? Went home bout slighty before 1.50. Guess wat. I think Timon and Pumba are funny. HAHA. Oh I wanna say sorry for my VERY little post lately. I think I've lost the willingness to post. I think I'm going to make a layout of timon and pumba now. go to  urlLink http://unangelic.org/underaged/index.html  in a bout 1 hour of reading this. Thank you.
