       It just occured to me that I should do some hw for art in my book, we went on to 'lino printing'...and I really don't like it. I know, I know, you can't always do what you want, but this..it totally  sucks  and I simply hate it. If its art, which is supposed to be expressing yourself, then why can't you go and express yourself instead of messing around with this small piece of carpet and putting paint on it like a complete  retard.   Here comes the professional answer: "Well, the reason for you havig to mess about with some random stuff is that you have to "learn" art just like Picasso and the other geniuses like him, since of course, they "learned" art aswell, they went to proper art schools and did art as a subject, just like Michael Angelo. Before you start expressing yourself you have to learn how to do it!"   AAARGH! NO!  I HATE IT!   1.) You don't learn art, you know what you have to do, and how you have to do it, if they would 'teach art' then everyone's art would be the same 2.) Not every Artist went to real art school, I really doubt that  Who cares about analysing art?huh? does every artist sit down and 'PLAN' before they paint or draw? NO! So why do we have to do that? Does that make us more professional? Or is it only that we are students? Well, I'll tell you something; even now, after analysing many artists' works, I still draw/paint in the same way, and it hasn't changed anything on my style at all, that I know the elements of design.  GCSE art is a failiure  and it is that way because they try to teach every subject in the same way. analysing with history and maths is completely alright..but ART?! NO!    I mean, look at this, do I care about this? What the hell is this? I don't wan to analyse it! Jeeeez. Does analysing a naked woman with big breasts in a wheelchair with some random shapes make my view on art different? Well, I think that you should be focusing as much as you can on NOT changing how I look at the things I don't like, because I am I and you won't force your views on me.  This is crap . I can't feel anything when I look at it apart from being disgusted, I am sorry, maybe the person who created it felt something, but probably it wasn't anything more than a "Friday night out, and drinking too much". I am gonna leave this for now and go on. I still need to do my art hw, and collect some lino prints.    I am listening to a Hungarian rap song, one of my all-time-favourites, wow it sounds so good, but what matters is not the rythm, but what it says. And what it says it very true indeed..."There's no way out, you are staying down in the dirt, no one helps you here, there is nothing left but burlgary and theft, but if you get caught, then that totally sucks!"...Doesn't make much sense in englsih does it? heh

       Here are a few pictures from last Friday, I loved last Friday, it was awsome. And why? You might ask, well, it's because I was with the coolest and best people I could be with, not movie stars, not astronauts, but with my friends.    Wow, is he an eating champion or what? Well, he sure is rich if he can order 3 Aquas and 4 dishes stuffed with the best Mexican food around. great, let's go on...    And who is this in the foreground?! Oh, this is just a crazy Aussie guy giving head under the table.    And this is me of course, in my awsome shirt :DDD HEIL PUCCINI!  And the last picture...well, I just had enough of hearing G-Unit in the radio, seeing G-Unit in the tv reading about G-Unit in the papers. So I made up my own crew, coz "we are the real players around the block", not them.      Hey, ignore the TehBotol on the table, it's not ours.  Sophie's Website

       I went to 'Mal Ambasador' today, which is a local low-class mall, but the good thing about it, is that you can get anything that's illegal. Pirated music CDs, movies, games for all platforms, BB pellet guns and even stolen hand phones. Of course, I spotted a KFC restaurant, so I decided to go in. Based on earlier experiences, I knew that KFC was not the place to have lunch in...but oh well, I still went in. As I stepped in, I noticed that behind the 4 cashiers there were huge lines, so I stepped into one. After waiting for about 20 minutes, I finally got to order.   "1 O.R. Burger and a large coke...with NO ICE!"  The response to this was "do yu want to wait 5 minutes for the burger? I said, screw this and went off. KFC SUCKS!

       You know, I had enough of being nice. I'm nice all the time, to every one. But I had enough of being nice, I sat down, and I started thinking. How has being nice profited me? Friends? What, people say that they are friends with me? I bet you that if I had any real problems they wouldn't give a shit about helping me. I know that, and I knew about it all along. WTF do you need friends for anyway? Some one to hang around with you so that u pay for their movie ticket, or their meal? Nah. I don't want any of that. Maybe I should try making people fear me, that would be another option, no one hanging on you for ur money, no one screwing about with you when they don't need anything special from you. All along, when I thought some one was my friend, I got screwed over, no matter if it was about a girl, or about something else. I realised that I don't need any support from other people, because I didn't get it all along.   If you are nice, then people will make use of you, and they will use you.   I stopped being nice to everyone, anyway, its just wasted energy, I had enough of people saying how much friendships are worth. They aren't worth anything, because you are  dependant  on others. I don't want to be dependant on some one, I want to be independent, and be strong, alone, so that I am more responsible. I started clicking around on google, and I found that there is a disorder which is related to this...  urlLink Dependent Personality Disorder   Wow, jeez, you know what? I might consider climbing the ladder on the FBI most wanted list, it must be fun, after all, you get to be on their website. I'll email them and say how evil I am nowadays, then they might label me an evil spirit, or a terrorist, or a marxist or something. Damn George Bush and his retard "axis of evil". Those good old Ukrainian citizens who lived in Hungary nearly all their life but got chased out by the FBI probably noticed the same things I did. Life is not about how much good you have done, its about how much you enjoyed it, and about how much you got out of it. There is no such thing as re-incarnation, we are animals just like the animals in the wild, why are we any different?  If you pass away, you will ask yourself what you have done in your life that you were so lucky to posess, and if you have been good to every one and then got screwed over all the time, then I think you won't be so happy after all.  Enjoy life untill you can.    urlLink    ANATOLI TSOURA, my new role model. Click on the photo to follow the link.

       I dunno what's wrong with me right now, I guess its just that im in a bad mood. This might not really interest you guys but oh well, usually I write my best posts when Im in a sarcastic mood. So I'll start writing and then see if it actually makes sense. Where should I start?...   Iraqi beheadings . I have recently noticed that beheading people is becoming increasingly popular, especially with our Iraqi friends of course, who killed a Korean hostage lately. The reason I felt sorry for (not because normally I wouldn't) the Korean hostage, was that he knew the same thing was going to happen to him, as with the other hostages (Nick Berg etc.). I mean, being a hostage and not knowing about what a terrible death you will have is alright, compared to being a hostage, and wating for the moment when they'll drag you infront of a camera, say a few words like "Get out Americans" and slowly cut through your throat. I simply can't stop thinking about this, I'm not shocked by the video, its just the thought of what he was going through; just imagine being there, in the same orange pyjamas Nick Berg was in, infront of the same people who killed Nick Berg, and in the same situation. Oh well, I guess I'll just leave it by saying "life is unfair".     I just wanna add a morbid comment, that I got from my friend when I was talking about the same thing with him. He described this phenomenon as probably being "peer pressure" (hahaha), and that the method of persuasion probably worked something like this "come on Ahmed, every one is doing it! Just give it a chance and try it!" As an outsider, I really could think of this whole thing as a new 'trend', afterall it is quite affective, isn't it?   Lesson learned:  Iraq is not a tourist destination

       My chemistry teacher, Dr.Stewert really is one of my favourite teachers. Not because he's an outstandingly good teacher, or because he's a genius, but because of his ability to pop around, down and up. I managed to record one of his magic disappearances, when he crawled into his magic hiding cave, right under his desk, then after a second or so, he re-appeard, and the lesson went on. Maybe he quickly had a shot of Scotish Whiskey? Who knows.. I really can't imagine what's under there, but I might go and explore tomorrow.

Then, at the end of the e-mail there is some bullsh*t, similair to this "send this to 10 of your friends, or you will have a terrible death, you will die of cancer, in great pain and agony, however, if u send it on, you will have great success in your love life!"  Wow, u guys must have loads of time if u think this is fun. "Lets go screw some one's day up by sending them 20 dumb emails!", you know what? I'm gonna take my revenge on all of you idiots, and publish your e-mail addresses, I'm sorry for the innocent ones. Anyway, here goes the list!  urlLink CLICK!   By the way, you guys have to realise that I'm being nice to you, because I could sell these email addresses off, instead Im gonna publish them for free. :)

       I'm tired of people whining about drugs and how they affect society. Their dumb and useless protests and attempts to stop international drug trade are pathetic. Guess what morons, you won't stop drug trade, and you know why? Because there is an  industry  behind it. Whatever makes money and profits  cannot  be stopped. Of course, these people are willing to help humanity by placing infront of themselves the impossible task of completely erasing drugs from the planet. I do not have anything against them, it's just that they don't realise what they are trying to stop.  I've been on a website lately ( urlLink drugfreeamerica ) which is obviously aimed at upsetting the parents even more, who have already been brainwashed by the media about how drugs can "kill, and destroy". I am not doubting that, since it really is true, however, it is  exaggerated .    This banner especially annoys me on the site. It's supposed to show the "innocent schoolboy" who is still naive and doesn't know much, so requires his parents supervision at all times. Obviously, the 'donate' section cannot be left off, after all this is a "non-profit" organisation, isn't it? Pff, yea sure!    They could name the above "guide" "nerdy parents' guide" or, "pester your kid if you are bored". What is this if its not stupid anti-drug propaganda?! I have to laugh at how this reflects the authors inexperiencedness. Look, if you have kids, and this makes you scared, then here's something you might not have heard before. If you're kid wants to try drugs, then he/she  will  do so, nomatter how often you check up what he/she has been watching over the internet, or on the TV, after all, the tv programs "have a bad influence on the youth", don't they? Well good luck with you're propaganda, I'm gonna go watch scarface and pulp fiction now...and guess what?! I won't smoke crack!! WOW!   urlLink

I was relaxing when I saw this huge cockroach crawling around. Since I like being cruel and I like seeing how unfair life is, I got my cat and made it mutate the insect. Uhh, I hate damn cockroaches, u can see its only got 3 legs haha, my cat did a good job.    Ahh, I guess that was a good form of entertainment for tonight. I'll go now.

       An Underground video came out, called Bum Fights, around a year ago if I remember correctly, which got critisized by both the American media and the government. Surprisingly the first volume got the makers millions of dollars in profit, so did the second one, and now, the third one is about to be released. Banning the series didn't work...should I say fortunately or unfortunately?   urlLink     The makers of Bum Fights are now not only making street fighting videos, but other stupid stuff aswell like special films with the different characters who were in the original Bum Fights. My favourite one is "Bling Bling", a crack junkie, who got first noticed when he was a cleaning assistant. He has his own website now, to promote the newly released DVD about him, its hilariously stupid.   urlLink     I recommend both sites, and the trailers, however they  do  contain offensive content.

       You know, I really had enough of those pussies, who leave anonymous comments on the right side, in the message board section, with all kinds of gay names, like "mishima" and "ass", because they have nothing better to do. If you have anything to argue about with me, then e-mail me dumb sh*t, don't waste my time, I don't want to read your gay comment that doesn't make any sense at all. I'm gonna say it again, e-mail me you pussy, thats why I left my e-mail address on the right side, just above the shout box..  I inserted a shout box onto my site, so people who are not registered can make (sensible) comments more easily. It is possible for registered users to leave comments directly under the posts. If I would write down my true feelings in this post, then probably half of you would start whining about how prejudice I am...oh well

       I wasn't intending to publish anything special, so I'll just upload a few funny photos for those of you who are interested. Some of the photos are adverts, from a stupid computer game (GTA III). I found most of them really funny, but you might not get them if you haven't played the game.    You decide on what this is, I just feel like eating it. Looks so delicous. :D (jk hahaha)    An advert from GTA III, some of you might not get it, but just go on in that case.    My dream car, wow, it even has a steering wheel!    Spit in my hand, b*tch!    Another advert from GTA III  Sorry if this wasn't up to the normal level u guys, I'm just really busy revising, as you could have noticed from the earlier posts, I have seom hilarious stuff left for next time though :))

I was feeling bored (always use that as an excuse if u do something lame) so I took a picture of my desk..AGAIN...just to show you how the amount of work I have to do increases.     Oh yea, and here is a fake Gucci watch I bought for Rp. 50.000 ($7), cool isn't it? I will take a few photos of the shops that are filled with pirated CDs aswell. I love pirated software.

Now that I checked up to see what its like, I found it quite usefull. This screenshot is hilarious     This guy can be seen at the videos section of the site, chemistry of course.

       Yeayea, I had loads of work to do, revising for end-of-year tests and doing coursework that has been left over. I am having a biology test tomorrow, on digestion, which is an exceptionally pleasant part; after all, every-one has an anus, right?     Biology is ok, but art is going on my nerves again. Doing these dumb pastel drawings, oh, sorry, not pastel Clich√© or something like that. I got corrected today, because I said pastel. Nvm...art is the only subject hippies are allowed to teach anyway. I discovered an online radiostation which broadcasts rap music, it is Hungarian so it has some Hungarian rap on it aswell, which can relax me especially, since I don't get to listen to much of that out here.  Click  here  to listen to it. You should have WinAmp to listen to it, but I think it works with other players aswell.(download the small file and play it with winamp)       This is the most hilarious website in the world, and  no  it is not porn, though it really does have a strange name. Anyways, what it does, is that it fills pages up with swearwords, so instead of "The man", you would see "the assf*cking man" you have to check it out!(just switch the language to the language of the site you want to change and enter the address of the site eg. www.hello.com...I often do it with www.bbcnews.com)   Enjoy.

       Yes, the day has come, and I am actually packing my bag, which is unbelievable. I hate to pack, so when the time comes, and I simply can't say "oh, I'll do it tomorrow" then I usually just get a few of my most important belongings and chuck them into a handbag. The only thing I'm worrying about is (because that of course is my style) the pirated DVDs and Audio albums I have. Will they stop me at the airport? Nah, I simply can't imagine that. Here are the following reasons:  -The X-Ray machines are only meant to search the bags for weapons and harmful objects that might cause accidents or might be used to cause damage.  -Even if they noticed 200 disks, and thought it was unusual, it's none of their business, after all, they are not there to check if I payed the taxes on them, or just copied them.  -They are really good quality copies, perfectly printed colourful covers which are just like the original ones, and labelled disks aswell..so its hard to tell if they really ARE fake.  Yea, so you might ask, "what if they do find out that they are pirated? What then?" Well, you know what I1ll say? I'll say I didn't know and that I got tricked over, nice lie, ey?...yea..(not)    This post kinda relates to the previous one for the reason that I was talking about how good it is to pirate things, well, maybe not always. Nevermind, I think this is my past post from Indonesia, I'll write to you guys when I get back to Hungary (yeaaa!).  I also wanted to share something strange with u guys, I have noticed that when I am a bit more than tipsy I start just staring at things, this quite funny actually when you see some photos of me and see the similarities.    Well I hope u enjoyed this post, I'm exhausted but I tired to make u smile. Have fun whatever you are doing in the summer, oh yea, and READ MY BLOG! :D

       I went out last night, and just so that u guys don't read about my monoton-sounding speeches of how much I had to drink, I'll tell you about how life is right now. Now that the end of the school year has come, many people are leaving, some of whom were friends of mine, I guess its just frustrating that people who I was hanging out with and saw as my friends are leaving now, of course, that still leaves us as friends, but its just not the same. Oh well, I guess I wnet through this many times before so I won't get emotional, somehow being emotional doesn't work out with me. I'm trying to explain this without going into too much detail, I want this post to make sense. Anyhow, this was my last going-out-getting-pissed night for this school year. I'm sure Sophie will have a few photos up on  urlLink her site .  Another thing that lately came up was "downloading mp3s = communism". It's not supporting communism if you download MP3s from the internet, it's just having fun, ruining the record companies' business. After all, we don't want those loser G-unit idiots to get rich, do we?!    Oh well, I guess the "red monster" is being picked on and blamed again. Comrade.

       I noticed all the stupid blogs that are around on the internet. I searched for a proper definition of blogging, and I found this:    A blog is basically a journal that is available on the web. The activity of updating a blog is "blogging" and someone who keeps a blog is a "blogger." Blogs are typically updated daily using software that allows people with little or no technical background to update and maintain the blog.    Well, i guess it's just too bad that what I saw was something more like this:  " sleepiness  work was so long today omgod and i sewar people like to come in at 10 right when we close... jeez, stayed till almost 1045 cleaning.. and i can't sweep.. BLAH i dunno how to sweep, then raymond mopped teh floor for me, so i washed the dishes bleh tired"  Wow, how interesting, that really contained so much information! You know what? I'm gonna start writing about every single thing I did on a normal day, jackass. Jeez, what's wrong with all these people?! oh well, here's my version   Today  Today I woke up, and my ass hurt. I got out of my bed and my ass hurt. I had a shower but my ass still hurt. I didn't have lunch coz I couldn't be bothered. So i just said, bleh, whatever, can't be bothered. Then I went to sleep again, coz I couldn't be bothered to keep my eyes open. Bleh. Wtvr. Cant be bothered.  Heh, I swear, u guys are just slowing search engines down, delete your shit off the internet, don't leave waste around! The funny thing is that these guys actually get comments aswell, which sound exactly the same. Anything else..? Oh yea, the perfect example is  urlLink here .

       The new Spider Man movie has been released and can now be viewed in cinemas around the world. Every one (nearly every one) who I know has seen it, just because "it looks cool". I don't think there's anything cool about it. This f*ckin idiot jumping around probably for a hot chick who look as if she was still a virgin despite the fact that she is 34. Just for that, I'm gonna watch Scarface ALL day. Guess what? I haven't seen Spider Man, and I'm not gonna see Spider Man 2 either. What's even 'worse' is that I haven't even seen one episode of "The Lord Of The Rings", because it is  gay . Yes, just incase you don't believe what you just read, I'll confirm it for you; I said  I haven't see any one of the LOTR episodes!   I swear I'm afraid I'll be publicly executed by the gathering of gay film directors. This pressure I feel whenever all the people start talking about a gay new film that has been released is tremendous. But, oh well, I'm not gonna support any film studios that make crappy films that have the same plot over and over.    The Tattoo that is on my backside  I have reached the point where I don't blame u guys who go on and on, bragging about how u were the first person to waste $15 to get into the premier to see the film. Really, I don't. I came to realise that you just have such boring lives, that u need something to brag about, and  perfectly understand you, don't worry.  Nevermind! I created my own action star, whats better is that he has more powers than Spider Man, he can hipnotise any one, because he is Ukrainian, and he was created in the tragic accident of the nuclear reactor melt-down. He is around 2 meters 30cm high and has a face that doesn't remind us of anybody. ... ...    Attention! If you see this horrible creature anywhere, do not attempt to disarm it.

       I was having lunch today, like a normal, straight person, when I reached for the coke, and lifted it up. I tilted it slightly, and I saw this homo on my coke bottle. MY COKE BOTTLE! I didn't wanna throw up onto my plate, so I quickly put it back on the tray and got some water instead, to have a 'homo-free' lunch. I simply can'T give a damn about homosexuality, so I simply don't give about people who choose to be f*cked up the ass, it's just that when it reaches the table where I have lunch..thats disgusting, sorry. This was what I saw:   urlLink    (click on image to enlarge!)  I mean...look at that, wtf is that? A girl or a guy? I don't want gay men on my coke, all right? I don't care about your new marketing strategy, and no, I am not gonna gel my hair and wear tight jeans and shirts!  YOU WILL NOT TURN ME GAY!   Jeez, I swear, some day, these faggots will turn being heterosexual illegal! To show how much I am against advertising products with gay men, I designed a new logo for coca-cola light, which is a bit more clear, and doesn't have any 'unnoticable details', so here it is:   urlLink     Hehe, I love making fun of large companies. :-)   Lesson learned:  Do not attempt, turning us, normal people into faggots!
