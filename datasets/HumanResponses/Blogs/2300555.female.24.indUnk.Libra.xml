      today is better than yesterday... the annoyin customer came back!... *hehehe* and I did the sale... eventhough i had to run around and around and around..... aniweis... have u ever learned how to fly? Me my self... i believe i can fly.. coz all my dream is always about flying.. but today.. i watched a lil birdie - which was found by Daniel - learned to fly... *we really dunno if she or he is a gurl or a boy* we named her or him UWI... so cute...  aniweissss... found out sumthin... that it aint easy to learn to fly... even for a bird... needs lotsa practices.. and guts as well.... i guess that is sumthin that we can copy... any new things we try to do... no matter how hard it is.. if we put our effort into it and keep on tryin ... we will be succeed! * thx for UWI*

      There is only one kind of successful negotiation......it is the kind where both parties come out ahead..... I really do not like using the word "win" because that implies a game of some sort where there are winners and losers......  negotiation occurs everywhere in life and life is not a game....2 be a successful negotiator....you must have the other person's interests in mind as well as your own.....

      To all my dearest friend..... when it comes to the other person's character and personal habits, make sure you can live with these as they are now..and if u cant be happy with the person the way he or she is now, dont pretend that ur happy with him or her... one of the biggest crime in this world is being cruel to ur own feeling...!

      feel like cryin....!!!!....being so nice to people sumtimes can be really hectic.. coz what happen is.. they will easily muck around with ur time.. and feeling...... and after a whole day dealin with all this matter... and what u wanna do is just take a deep breath and relax for a while.... they still expect u to give them the best u can give without knowing that what they do to u is a waste of time...  and CORRUPTION OF EMOTION!... i dunno what the hell is that.. but it's just dat.. i feel like im being used..... *huaaaaaaaaaa* hiks hiks...  but this wont stop me from being nice... i know sumtimes it feels fake when u have to be nice while u're actually feel sick of being nice... but at least by being nice.. will make the world be friendly back to me...!

      Happy Eid!!!!!.....The winning day for us!!!!.... Just like what i have forwarded to every number in my add book... Let's push rewind, reverse and drive away and see all the mistakes disappear in our rearview... Let's start forgivin b4 we'll be running outta time..  but wait a second... is it only bout forgiving and being forgiven..??? it's more than that.. coz that is sumthin that we can do everyday without waiting for this holy day...It's about EATING! *LOL* naaah not that one as well... what i like about today... the gathering... laughter and joy.. all blends togetha... forget all the sadness for a moment...  well it's sumthin that u can also do everyday though... is just that this time has a different meaning.. i cant really explain what sort of feelin i have that make this day is so special to me... maybe tomorrow... too tired to think..... to selfish to share? hehehhe ;P

      been workin hard lately.. take ova the shop... bit hectic... lotsa fun.. especially if u reach the target... aniweis.. satisfaction and happiness... which one comes first? and which one u after? to me... they should come togetha.. but i know that sumtimes i have to be realistic... that sumtimes happiness and satisfaction do not come togetha.... and sumtimes they dont even get along!.... ok u feel happy because u pass the exam.. but u're not satisfied with the grade... that's one of the example..or... u can feel that ur body is shakin bcoz u're experiencing an enormous satisfaction... but then at the end u dont feel happy at all...  well for me happiness and satisfaction comes togetha is like when i feel so bad about sumthin that i say or i do to sumone and i feel so bad so that i have to ask for an apologize.. and then when u say sorry from the deepest of your heart.. and the person that u feel bad to... trully forgive you and say "I forgive u" with a smile... and that smile warms ur heart.. that's when i feel both satisfaction and happiness.. that's one of a small example...there's a lot more.. Afterall, life is all about risks and it requires you to jump. No matter which one should come first...don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have done, or could have had *hehehe nyambung ga sih*.... btw topic taken from the convey between Mr. SokTau and Mr.TakeiTEasy... hehehehhe thx guyz....

      just finished all the exam! finally! it's time for holideiiiii... :) yippee *alangkah senangnyah* hehehehe.. but wait.. lotsa people think that this is not the right time to think about holidei.. it's too sooon they said.. it's actually the moment of waitin... waitin for sumthin that doesnt even exist.. ? hehehe... they'll kill me if they know i make fun of this... i guess what they're tryin to say is that... we'd better prepare ourself for the worst thing that might happen.... which is FAIL from the exam!!!!... hmm i kinda agree though... but it's just that what's wrong for having some fun after exam week... it's sort of the way of releasing stress... let's not forget the minimum sleep hours during the exam week..red eyes.. numb brain.. COME ON!!!... i need to have some fun!... we did what we could... we did the best we could do.. just dont forget to pray... but dat doesnt forbid us from getting pampered? rite? live the life today as maximum as u can... u're free to do anything!....AND "fuck the pesimist!" (quoted from pearl jam).. excuse ma language

      have u ever felt really uncomfortable in front of the person u just met? it's not an okay feeling i guess... no matter how far u try to get to know her/him... it just doesnt feel right.. then it makes u feel unsecure..  *sigh*... so the question is... how d'ya deal with it? just do what u have to do and dont take everythin she or he does personal?.. or take her/him to the arena? and do the one on one battle.. let some of your kungfu styles out.. :)  i choose the last one.. the worst likely scenario... there will be an argument.. but then u just dont wanna be a hypocrite...and again all i want is just tryin to be honest by sayin what i really feel.. and hope that it will sort everything out...

      hello world?:) sumone's bday today.. gettin old.. is that what everybody wants... old = mature? i dun think so...it has got nuthin to do wit age i suppose.. it's bout experiences and backgrounds... pasca divorce.. tends to build some internal strenght... a resistance of reality might as well occur but at the end.. it's a process of being ourself... we tend to develop ourself... infected by the condition that surround us..

      Laughin at people.. that's easy and probably sumthin that we do everyday.. if sumthin's funny we laugh right? i suppose we should laugh.. but laughin at ur stoopidity.. YOURS not theirs.. sumtimes isnt funny anymore.. admit it.. if u do sumthin funny (accidentally).. ppl will laugh at u.. and u'll feel ashamed.. angry probably? Somehow, it's hard to laugh at ur own mistake... but i found out that laughin at urself means u will be able to see urself from other ppl's view.. and that helps u to build a positive energy..

      It's nearly nu yer now..  Hope u guys spend it with those u love!  The New Year has always been a time for looking back to the past, and more importantly, forward to the coming year. It's time to reflect on the changes we want, or need, if we're to have the motivation move forward.  It is having sumthin old.. and making it a lil bit better.. or way so much better.. or to have sumthin new.. and decide to keep it and believe in it..   if u have nu yer's resolution, try to stay with it.. or if u have to break it, break it with pride..  aniweis.. stop talkin too much yacko! heuheuehhe HAPPEEEE NU YEEEEEER!!!!!!!

      yesterday... a deep convey about sum theory of relationships...  everyday we learn sumthin bout love... everyday we're tryin to figure it out.. to know what love is...  is it like life and death experience? why use the word life instead of birth? birth is the opposite of death... not life... life has no opposite!... life is life... and live ur life to the max... !

      here i am again... in front of the monitor.... wondering that it's funny how people sumtimes can easily change their mind without thinkin any further... that any other person involve in their decision can be really affected... in a positive way and in a negative way...

      Hello there, the angel from my nightmare..The shadow in the background of the morgue...The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley....We can live like Jack and Sally if we want ....Where you can always find me....We'll have Halloween on Christmas....And in the night we'll wish this never ends....We'll wish this never ends.....Where are you and I'm so sorry....I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight.....I need somebody and always.....This sick strange darkness comes creeping on so haunting every time......And as I stared I counted webs from all the spiders.....Catching things and eating their insides....Like indecision to call you and hear your voice of treason....Will you come home and stop this pain tonight.....Stop this pain tonight.....Don't waste your time on me you're already The voice inside my head (miss you miss you)

      it's funny how people have set up a plan on their mind.... but at the end all they can say that "hey it's just a plan!" and there's no realization at all for the plan... but hang on... it's not becoz of them... it's sumthin that we actually dont think about... it's what u call destiny...*i guess?* no matter how good the plan u have but if ur destiny says that the plan doesnt work... then it doesnt work... it's unavoidable!... it's sumthin that's just not meant to be... it's not that we choose not to be... but it's just have not to be!... so not be it!... and that we can not do anythin about it...

      *sigh* nevermind... there's always a good reason behind all of this.. it's just that try to find a positive side while u're in the middle of negative things is not always easy... perhaps this is the way that God reminds me of sumthin... to get sum rest coz last year was a bit hectic for me.. to realize that we are not always surrounded by happiness...  and the important thing is that we are nuthin in front of God...

      why too good to be true? is there such thing like dat? coz to me it has a sarcastic meanin.. nuttin is perfect in this world.. nuttin.. anythin on the surface can be so perfect but nobody knows what's in the inside.. no one knows.. unless they try to find out... and learn... only wif ur heart would u truly see coz da most important things are not visible to the eyes...
