      I got my schedule!  Adv. (179) 1 - Lifeline (FH) 2 - CPU Diagnostics (T190) 3 - AP English 3 (361) 4 - Japanese 3 (344) 5 - Lunch 6 - AP Chemistry (162) 7 - AP Chemistry (164) [ Tuesdays and Thursdays] 8 - AP Calculus BC (T290) 9 - AP US History (354)  Wow, my transcript is gonna look awesome.  I'm also going to die, but that isn't as important.  My mornings are pretty easy, so I can sleep in quite a lot and not miss anything.  That makes me happy.  On the other hand, my afternoons are suicide.  Whatever, I'll deal with it.  At the moment, I have no classes with Sarah, no classes with Ilana, gym and lunch with Alexa, and because Adrienne's schedule is fucked up I don't know if I have any classes with her (aside from Japanese).  I'm bored.  - Brian

      Welcome back Ilana!    I don't have to much to say, other than I think its good that I'm leaving for two weeks. I'm not really sure what I'm thinking at the moment, so maybe it will help me clear my head.    - Brian

      New post time!    Today was quite the party.  Before I get any farther, there is a piece of information I feel I should share with you.  Halle Berry is  hott.   I saw  Catwoman  with Carolyn.  The plot was a piece of shit, but the leather costume looked very very good on Halle Berry so it sorta made up for it.  Of course, you've got to wonder why on earth she would decide to make such a crappy movie...    After watching the movie, Carolyn and I stood outside of Northbrook Court calling people and generally being bored.  We wound up going to Blockbuster and rented  Scream 2 , which we watched at her house and caused me to arrive home a wee bit past curfew.      Umm...I don't really have anything to say, so I'm going to end this entry.  Good night everyond.    - Brian

      Actually you shouldn't, because then you wouldn't be able to watch  I Love the 90's , and that would be sad.    Blogger got a makeover and now has many more text options to use. I like the options, but the text I'm typing in (right now) is showing up larger and is harder to read. I can now bold, italicize, colorize, align, spellcheck, change fonts, and change sizes without having to type in annoying tags.       I made a CD!  Yay for me!  For those of you who care, this is what is one it:      Float On - Modest Mouse    Hit the Floor - Linkin Park    What Are Friends For - Reel Big Fish    Cherry Lips - Garbage    Who Runs This - Angel Demar    Soul to Squeeze - Red Hot Chili Peppers    Get Free - The Vines    Purple Haze - Jimi Hendrix    Everlong - Foo Fighters    Drive - Incubus    Control - Puddle of Mudd    You're so Damn Hot - Ok Go    Throw Away Your Television - Red Hot Chili Peppers    Get What You Need - Jet    I am the Highway - Audioslave    Reptilia - The Strokes    The Way We Get By - Spoon    Aerials - System of a Down    Get Over It - Ok Go    Do You Like It - Our Lady Peace      Had a family dinner tonight. I wasn't in the greatest of moods, so I got annoyed with them quickly and was quite happy when we finally left. We ate at L. Woods, the foods okay. The fries are great though.      I just recently started talking to an old friend again, which is nice. I was actually up until 4 in the morning talking to her, but then I forced myself to go to sleep in fear of my parents. Of course, then what happened was that I was past the point of sleepiness and couldn't fall asleep. I think I finally dozed off at 5:30, but I woke up 10 so the sleep wasn't even really worth it.       Umm...nothing else to say.  Well, there are a few things I   could   say, but these thoughts of mine are not for the general public.  So I'm not posting them.      I think this entry was boring (as usual), so I apologize if you feel that I have just wasted your time. I'll try harder next time. I promise. (Well, not really, but whatever).      - Brian

      I derive a ridiculously large amount of pleasure by creating pointless titles for my posts.  This one is the first name of a hip-hop artist who had a free song on iTunes (which I naturally downloaded...it was free!).  I also think its well suited to follow after the title "God Damnit."  Life has gotten better since last Friday, so I'm currently quite happy.  How I'll be after tomorrow's test...well, we'll just have to see, won't we?  I'm hanging out with Jack all day tomorrow, and then partying up it with Lelia friday.  I'll probably be hanging out with Quinn and Carolyn on Saturday, but thats not set in stone.    We're dissecting a fetal pig in Bio.  I probably could write a good post about death and mutilating the corpse of a baby pig, but I'm too tired to write up something that requires as much thought as a topic like that would require.    I might get to visit Andrea!  If I can get my act together I might actually be able to go, which will definitely make this summer awesome.    In Andrea's most recent Xanga entry she wrote about how she wanted to be "young" again.  Its strange because I really really  really  want to be 21, out of my house and generally out of my current life.  Only another 5 years 'till I'm 21.    Umm...nothing else to say.  Got my ticket-deal sorted out.  As I said before, my brain isn't functioning well enough to write anything of substance.  Good night.  - Brian

      I started another entry earlier today, which I had the complete intention of posting, but then my computer decided to be a bitch and I had to restart the damn thing.  On the other hand, the post was quite boring (as will be this one), but at least I like the title of this post more than the title I originally had: Another Uninteresting Post.  Of course, this title has no meaning while the other one at least warned you that you were going to waste your time reading this.  I'm listening to a Maroon 5 CD through iTunes.  I think they're much more talented than just about all other pop bands; they have a unique style which I haven't heard from any other band.  My liking of them may just stem from my deprivation of all other pop bands and as a human I happen to need some crappy addicting music in my life, but I prefer to think that I like their music for the original reason.  They also remind me of Explo, so I can't really  not  like them.    Its weird to think that its been just about a whole year since I was last there.  I still remember everyone (well, everyone worth remembering anyway).  I still miss just about everyone and everything, it sucks that I haven't talked to Ava, Kelly or Jenna for such a long time.  And even though I've talked to Andrea quite recently I still miss not being able to hang out with her and not being able to talk to her so often.   I miss being with Ava in the computer lab while she typed up some of the best Poems I'd ever read while I messed around on the computers.  I miss wandering around New Haven with Kelly.  I miss going to that ice cream place with Andrea.  I miss running through the rain with Jenna.  Wow, I really know how to bitch and whine, don't I?  I would have said "don't answer that," except as a blog you cannot respond to my comments and I don't really need to worry about you reaffirming my ability to bitch and whine.   In other news, my life continues to be boring as Hell.  'Cept Hell probably isn't boring, just immensley painful.  My mom and sister are out of town looking at colleges, so its just me, my dad and my brother.  I like it better this way; neither one of them really cares what I'm doing; I feel much more free.  I'm really glad that I'm not a social person, it would suck if I couldn't enjoy being alone for long periods of time.    Adrienne and I may possibly hang out tomorrow.  I invited her to hang out tonite, but I called at around 9 and she said that she still had homework to do.  It sounded very much like an excuse to avoid me, but I don't particularly care too much.  I took the first step to try to re-establish a friendship between the two of us.  I'll just have to see where things go.  Well, I'm done for today.    - Brian

      Today was the 4th of July!  Tomorrow I do not have summer school!  Exclamation Point!  So, my day:  I woke up at 11:45, which was a party.  Ate a bagel, read the comics, did nothing, the usual.  I went to Five Seasons at 1 and returned home at 2:30, unfortunately finding out that Planet Smoothie was closed during my return trip.  Took a shower at 4, then proceeded to put in my contancts and attempt to sculpt my hair by means of a good-smelling wax which my hair-cutter-person had me buy.    The real action started at 5.  I arrived at Carolyn's hizouse and played poker with Quinn, Ellen, Liz and some of her friends.  I got second, but we ended the game prematurely so I easily could have won in the end.  But the highlight of the game was when Quinn got out on the second hand, the first time I'd ever seen him do so poorly at poker.  I ate a delicous - orgasmic, actually - cupcake for desert.  Nicole and her friend then left to go to the Winnetka fireworks.  Despite my persistence that the rest of us follow suit, we wound up goign to the beach.  Rachel was at the fireworks.  Despite the fact that we had been close freshman year, I felt disconnected from her tonight, so I'm pretty sure our friendship is down the drain.    After the fireworks we met up with a drunken Jake and Jeremy, which was very annoying.  Jake overplayed the whole thing, and was being very attention-whore-ish; Jeremy was fine about the whole thing.  Jake and Jeremy both wound up riding away on their bikes despite the girls pleas for them not to (and then they worried the rest of the time), Ilana walked home, and Caroline walked me back to Carolyn's to pick up my car.  I dropped her off and Jakes and then went home.  We were supposed to call Nicole, but we never did...she probably feels betrayed or something, but she wasn't missing anything.    I talked to Carolyn for a while over AIM, nothing really came out of the conversation.  We decided that I should go out with Caroline (I gave her and Ilana the task of getting me a girlfriend, just for the hell of it).    I found out that Garbage is a  really  sketchy band.  They have songs about hermaphrodites.  I don't know about you, but I consider that sketchy.    I'm gonna go now.  Good night.   - Brian

      Well, the title of this post has nothing to do with anything aside form the fact that Andrea just said it in an IM.  This weekend has been good in a number of ways.  Well, just two, but screw you.  1)  Its a four day weekend!   Fuck, now that I think about it, the fact that I care how long the weekend is means that I'm not having a real summer.  But its still a four day weekend, so I can still feel happy.  2)  I talked to Andrea!  She might be coming to visit, which would make me uber-mondo-happy.  Yesterday was fun.  I missed out on some poker playing and Nicole's house hanging out at stuff because I decided to stay in and talk to people from me online website and then have a 3-hour phone convo with Andrea.  I haven't seen Nicole all summer, so its a little sad that I didn't get to go to her house, but talking to Andrea made missing out on that worth it.  I visited Ilana at treats and picked up some food at Vernons for me to eat...party in my room, haha.  Today I slept 'till 11:30 yet managed to be tired by 5 (and I'm still awake at 1:15 in the morning).  Dinner at my Grandma's house was pretty boring, and I wasn't very hungry, but I don't see her too often so I didn't mind.  After that I hung out with Ilana and Alexa at Caribou, Carolyn and Steve turned up eventually.  We then went to Blockbuster, but they were out of Scream 2 and despite my insistence of renting "Club Dread," we wound up getting "Murder by Numbers," which was really good 'cept I had to leave Carolyn's house halfway through the movie to get home by curfew.    Umm, fireworks tomorrow!  Hopefully it won't rain, because I've got a commitment made for Monday night which I don't want to have to drop out of last-minute.    Okay, time for me to go to sleep.  G'night to everyone.  - Brian

      Its Friday morning.  11 minutes into Friday, to be exact.  Blogger seems to be a much more sophisticated program than Livejournal, so I decided to switch.  I also have nothing to write about, I just created this because I was bored.    I saw Spider-man 2 tonight with Alexa, which was quite fun.  We tried to find other people to come with us to ease the assumed akwardness (which there was none of), but it turns out that people do things on Thursday nights, so we went to see it as just the two of us.  The movie was good, an enjoyable experience as a whole, and in the end my Thursday night was well spent.    And just a note to anyone who wants to park at Old Orchard on a busy night: Don't even bother looking for a space.  Just park on the roof of the lot and be done with it.  Besides, chances are you could use the exercise.    I got a haircut!  My hair is now short.  Like, normal-guy-haircut short.  I miss being able to run my hands through my hair, but on the other hand I do not have a psuedo-fro type thing going on now.  (Which is a good thing).    I don't know if anyone I know is going to be finding this, but just incase someone does I probably won't be posting too much personal information in this thing.    This was only an opening entry, hopefully things will get more interesting in the next few ones.  I'm not making any promises though, you'll just have to hope/pray/make virgin sacrifices to a shamanistic diety.  - Brian

      Hello my dear readers.  As most (or all) of you know, I am at camp right now.  Its called "The Digital Media Academy," and it's located at Stanford University.  I'm taking a course on learning how to use the program 3d Studio Max.  It's fun.   Okay, now that I mentioned all of that, I can write something more interesting.  Unfortunately, there is a problem.  There really isn't anything interesting to write about  So I guess I'll ramble on about camp some more.   Just about everyone in the camp left today, so there are only 5 of us left (there were only about 20 people to begin with).  We have the same amount of freedom I had at camp last year...they don't really care where we are or what we do as long as we are at class when we're supposed to be and we're back at the dorm by 10:15.  Of course, this place doesn't compare to my experience at Explo in any way at all, because last year's Explo was the Jesus fucking Christ of summer camps.  On the other hand, I didn't come to camp this year for the same reason I went to camp last year; last year the focus of being there was the social aspect (although I was interested in the courses), but this year I am completely focused on learning the program, for it is of great importance that I know if I want to leap into the gaming industry when I am older (and knowing if I like this stuff or not will also help me determine my college major).  The food at the cafeteria here is sub-par, but food at any summer camp I've been to has always been like that (it may just be my mentality).  So, instead of forcing myself to perform the masochistic act of eating cafeteria food (even though its not freally masochisitic because there are no sexual implications associated with the eating of bad food), I have eaten just about all of my breakfasts at the cafe in the bookstore and I try to make eat either dinner or lunch at subway (but not both).  I think I use parentheses too much.  I mean, seriously, look over the last two paragraphs.  I used like 10 fucking parentheses or something.  I also enjoy throwing in random curse words, it makes me seem more like an angry, angsty teen, which you all know I am.  I'm also quite sarcastic when I type these things up, which may not be one of my brighter ideas seeing how I cannot type the inflections of my voice over the internet.  Hmm, well our resident dorm person, Lizette (I really like that name) (gah! parentheses!), went to rent us Euro Trip and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, so I'm going to end this now and go watch those with the 4 other dorm mates that I have.   Good night.  - Brian
