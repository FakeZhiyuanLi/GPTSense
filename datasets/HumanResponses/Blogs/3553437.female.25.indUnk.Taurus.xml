      Why is it that I still think about them and wonder WTF they are doing?  Why can't I just leave them well enough alone.  For example - I logged into my old college email account and saw that my hs/college boyfriend had logged in the same day.  I haven't checked that email account in 4 years - and yet the second I saw that - I just HAD to send him an email - WHY WHY WHY - he is effing married.  He was going to marry me, but I was too scared and young to committ.  But why can't I just leave well enough alone - why did I have to send the email - i am sure he is super happy not talking to me - And another one of my ex's is married already and expecting a baby - I am only 25 - and so are they - Granted all my ex's live in Texas and I live in DC - but is it so wrong to contact them - I really don't want to see them, I just want them to know I still think about them.  Does that do any good though????  I wonder........

      Well today has been crap so far... Its raining.  Got in an argument with the BF.  It was totally my fault.  I am so effing moody - I actually just got all my stuff and left his house.  I have never done anything so irrational to him before.  Then as I am driving home, I decide to call him - he decided he didn't want to talk to me.  SONOFA - I hate when I get a dose of my own medicine.  So as I am driving home, I think to myself why I have not filled my paxil RX lately.  Screw not taking it - my sanity is worth drug dependancy.  So I decided that my I would pay my other aniexty ridden friend DM - or poison - a call.  So I go over and watch Coupling and get a Wellburtin to even me out.  It is working.  He is currently at a Crawdad party with another friend.  Now I am sitting at my house debating whether or not to call BF.  We have dinner reservations tonight, but honestly I am not sure I even want to go.  I am still in a funky ass mood and I don't want to get into another fight. I think I might go smoke now.
