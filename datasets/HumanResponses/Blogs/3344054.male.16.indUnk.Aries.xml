         Hello and Welcome to my Stories page. This is about the stories I have made and I'll tell why I've written it. So far, I have made three and I'm planning to make a forth. The first three are based on horror and I love horror cause you can really do anything with horror.  My first story is "THE NIGHT OF THE WOLF", this is about a teenage boy who is enjoying life and has a beautiful girlfriend that he really loves. One night he gets attacked by a werewolf but his friend Michael gets killed and he only gets scratched by the wolf. So after he recovers, he realises he is not himself and he feels strangely. Then he gets visions and also gets warnings. He doesnt take any notice and on the second night he turns into a bloodthirsty wolf. After the massacre, he gets like newspaper articles about the gory and terryfying blood bath. He realises that he must run away from his friends and his girlfriend so they wont get any harm. He goes to the woods and then he realises that he must have control of the wolf inside him, so he controls the transformation and learns how to survive the wilderness. Time has passed and things havnt really changed, except the relationship of his girlfriend. He then meets a stranger who says he is the very first werewolf of time. He learns that the stranger's plan is to make the whole Earth a breed of werewolves and so the werewolf race wont go extinct. The teenager realises that he must stop him and fight for the Earth's sake, even though he is one of them. He is also sacrificing his life to save others and his friends. I have made this story because I am a werewolf lover and I loved such movies that had werewolves are An American Werewolf in London, Dog Soldiers, Underworld and the new film by Stephen Sommers Van Helsing with Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. I love how when they get bitten or scratched, they start to feel different and they then transform into a bloodthirsty wolf. In Van Helsing, a new kind of transforming was newly introduced. In the film, the character would have his skeletal structure move to place into a wolf but they also rip their skins apart so they can have the fully wolf look.   My second story is "DRACULA RESSURRECTION", this story is about a vampire slayer who hunts vampires because his parents were killed by vampires and he seeks revenge on trying to make the vampire race gone. He then realises that the legendary Dracula has awoken and comes back from the dead to complete his task. He brings back his full power and only the slayer has to stop him. I had to make this one because I love Dracula and the films that are related to him. Dracula I think is pretty good looking guy but not really attractive but he has a power that brings women to his seduction. My third story is "THE SHADOW HUNTER", this story is about a group of teenagers goes on a road trip. Their van breaks down and they go in a facility they dont even know. They dont even know what some disturbing things has happened in the facility. They even dont know, that a serial killer is set loose and is on the rampage, killing whatever he can kill. The teenagers must survive and out-wit the killer to be smart. I wrote this story cause I loved the game "Manhunt" and it about a serial killer that must killer other crazy serial killers. I also I loved the new re-make "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", about the teenagers going to a house that has a dark secret. Thomas Hewitt or known as 'Leatherface'. You get horror films such as 'The Night of Elm Street' (Freddy Krueger), 'Friday the 3th' (Jason Voorhees), 'Halloween' (Michael Myers) They are all created horror characters but Leatherface is a real man and it is based on a True Story.
