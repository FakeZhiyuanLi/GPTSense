						   Rather than post lyrics to my regular blog, where untold numbers of random people might read them, I thought that this specific project deserved its own location, where some random people might find it, and that would be okay, but that this would also serve as a place I could send specific people whose advice I sought on lyrics and other matters of importance to the budding career of a country musician.   So this site's for you.  And me.  Both of us, I guess.  I hope you enjoy, as I know I will.

						   This one doesn't have a title yet, nor a bridge (PB, near the bottom), but I'd appreciate any feedback anyone can offer. (including suggestions for the title) I realize also that the meter isn't immediately clear, but assume that it makes sense with the melody, and judge from there.  -*-*-*-*-*-*-  V1: 	Warm summer breeze blew through the window 	Cooled the sweet sweat of two lovers who were tangled up in bed; 	He was lost in peaceful, dreaming slumber 	While she stared at the ceiling, thoughts running through her head. 	Not so long ago, as high school sweethearts, 	Laying out in grassy fields, watching stars at night; 	Back then it seemed they'd go on forever, 	But lying there right then, she knew something wasn't right.  PC1:	And she laid there trying to figure out just how she'd make him see 	Cuz she knew in her heart this was the way it had to be.  C:	Sometimes a woman needs to leave the comfort  	of her lover's hand, 	Sometimes the melody has got to stand alone 	without the band, 	It doesn't mean that I don't love you, 	cuz babe, y'know I do; 	I'm doing this for me as much as 	I'm doing this for you.  V2:	Next morning he woke up to find her sitting 	On the corner of their bed, her face pressed in her hands;  	Said, "Baby, what's the matter, why you crying?" 	What came next was something he just could not understand. 	She told him bout her late-night revelation 	How she needed to try living by herself in someplace new; 	He just sat and stared and watched her lips move, 	And wondered aloud if there was something he could do.  PC2:	She said, "Baby, there ain't nothing that you've done or could've changed, 	I think it's time some things in this girl's life got rearranged."  (REPEAT CHORUS)  PB:    (REPEAT CHORUS)  (c) 2004  -*-*-*-*-*-*-  **About the Song/Process** This was a first attempt at writing a song for a female artist, in something vaguely resmbling a female voice.  Thanks to the people who provided kindling for this one, and special thanks to Candace for the line she contributed.    Started with a vague story, started brainstorming reasons a 20-something woman might up and leave a comfortable relationship--reasons that might initially seem enigmatic to the guy in the story.  Thought then that I might take it in the direction of Terri Clark's "I Wanna Do it All," but decided against the laundry list of things the woman in the story wanted to accomplish before settling down.  Thought I wanted to write the bridge as the guy's revelation and final understanding acceptance of her reasons for leaving (which still will probably be the way it goes), and then follow it with a chorus specific to the guy, indicating that he chose to take off from the small town, do some growing for both of them, and leave the whole thing up to fate.  Lyric writing instructor thought that was a bit too epic, and I think he's absolutely right.  Decided the opening scene (bedroom, summer night) and some sensory things to include (breeze, sweat), then wrote the second prechorus.  Next day, went to the media center at Berklee and wrote the entire song in the hour before it was due.  A new record. :)

      i just talked to a computer-genius friend of mine who i went to school with at unh.  told him about my very exciting duties as casa ambassador for boston, and let him know that my final un-done duty was to set up a web page.  and he told me to send him the info and he'd take care of me.  wow.  nice.  and now my dear melody has signed on, and she's bubbling about kenneth branagh's "hamlet." (mind you, the only tolerable movie version of "hamlet"... surprise, surprise... the infallinble kenneth branagh does the impossible.)  i hate babbling.  especially when i'm just doing it for the sake of babbling.  no i love it.  and particularly when i'm doing it for that purpose.     i swear i'll not let insomnia rob me of another perfectly good night's sleep.  oh fine... i will.  i know i will.  i just reminded myself in talking to melody that i haven't seen kenneth branagh's "much ado about nothing" in far too long.  gah... that just roped me into 2 or so hours...

      yesterday i didn't write anything.  sorry about that.  alright, so lemme talk about yesterday a bit...  first of all, last night i went to the semifinals of the ICCA at boston university.  i judged two of the three quarterfinal rounds that fed into it and i saw the third.  anyway, the show was... decent.  it was.  my problem is this- the amherst zumbyes were robbbed.  that's all there is to it.  consequently, so were the bc acoustics.    there's a strict 15 minute limit on your performance set, and judges are instructed to rate the groups, then are told if any went over the time limit, and if anyone did, they're demoted a spot.  k?  k.  anyway, zumbyes went over, so they got demoted (it deserves mention that the director of the zumbyes took a moment during the set to wish one of the guys in the group a happy birthday, after which the audience applauded... i wonder how much they were over by?)    the demotion of the zumbyes meant that the second place group gets to move on to the finals in nyc.  problem #2... the group who was awarded second place gave, at best, the 4th best performance of the night.  at best.  i mean it.  and said group, for all their energy, will get slaughtered at the finals.  so the acoustics, who were placed third, gave what i considered either the best or second best performance of the night, and as such, should have moved on... IMHO  ugh.  i hate sour grapes, and i hate being the guy who runs around crying foul after a competition, but damn.  talk about dropping the ball, judges.  then i came home, kinda disappointed, and found myself flipping through hotornot.com.  two hours later, i still found myself flipping through that damn page clicking 1-10 ratings for people i didn't even know... and i'm not sure at that point i was even looking at the pictures.  tragic.  melody, i missed you last night, dear.  thank you for checking in from girls' night.  made my night :)  i woke up this morning and i'm fairly certain my fears have been realized: i have strep.  yep.  i do.  i woke up sounding like joan rivers after a carton of newports, and realizing i had to be at the studio today.  or did i?  i checked the session note in my email and as of wednesday, there was no session scheduled for sunday.  ::crosses fingers::  he said stay tuned for an update, but an update never came.  called the studio manager's cell- no answer.  called the studio manager's office- no answer.  called studio a- tyler, the other intern answers.  tells me no worries, he's got the fort held down and will be heading home soon.  what a beautiful sunday.  i'm serious.  it's a beautiful day in boston.  maybe i'll go out today... the fresh air would do me good.  still waiting on the results from icca's quarterfinal in buffalo.  i have a couple friends in the buffalo chips, and rellz and i have been anxiously awaiting the results, which were handed down over 12 hours ago.  why don't we know?  iiiiii dunno.  that's all for now.  i've done nothing interesting and thus have little of interest to say.  but it sure was fun talking at you. :)

      i'm in san francisco.  i'm very excited to be here, although i'll be completely honest here... for as much as i love people and believe strongly in the inherent good in them, i was mothafuckin' freaked out in oakland.  and the trains here make no sense.  none.  you can't get anywhere from where you are.  that appears to be the motto by which the bart (bay area rapid transit) abides.  at least in boston, the trains make sense... red line is red cuz of harvard, blue line is blue cuz it goes underwater, green line is green cuz of the emerald necklace.  orange line... is ghetto.  and orange is a ghetto color.  so yeah.  but the trains here don't have colors.  not external ones, anyway.  it's stupid.  so yeah... got out of the station at 24th and mission and followed jamie's directions to his house.  he had written in the email about "walking all the way up the hill" and "happy quad workout."  so i get on to 25th street eventually, and start hiking up the gradual incline, suitcase in tow.  i think to myself "self... this isn't so bad."  then, that evil bitch, irony, slapped my across the face, hard.  i looked in front of me and could think of nothing more articulate to say than "you've gotta be fuckin' kidding me."  the road jamie lives on is between 45 and 50 degrees, depending how far up the hill you go.  it's friggin' insane.  so yeah.  i'm here.  and my legs... they be none too happy.    i'm looking forward to getting out and doing things in the city.  because right now, i'm looking at this amazing view out jamie's window, and the only two feelings i can associate with this city right now are sheer terror and muscle pain.  and possibly cramped muscles, as well, from my 6 hour flight from newark.  somehow i managed to get suckered into watching all three in-flight movies and sleeping not a wink.  except during the 49 minute flight to newark.  go figure.  so i watched "behind enemy lines" which is yet another predictable "bad enemy kills good person and other good person is in danger of being killed so commanding officer has to risk his career to save a soldier nato won't save collectively" movie.  *yawn*  then it was "picture perfect" from a few years back.  great movie.  loved the movie.  the first 9 times i saw it.  it still has its moments, but while sometimes those moments are heightened by one's ability to quote them verbatim, in times like these, you wish your memory lapsed on the exact dialogue.  finish it up with "serendipity" which i first saw on my flight out to oregon the end of january.  great movie.  love it.  john cusack.  always a winner.  kate beckinsale.  always a hottie.  winning formula right there.  some great dialogue, nice moments.  it's all good.  my apologies to two people in particular, and several others in general...  katrina, i'm sorry i wasn't around to hear about your interview, but thank you for emailing, and i'll write back very, very soon.  i'm glad you can't see yourself as a new yorker.  you're not one.  and the charleston offer is still open, to my knowledge.  mary, i'm sorry for not being around to engage in prolonged vineyard-bashing and other fun activities.  your blog and away messages seem rather bitter, so thought i'd make mention ;)  seriously though, i'll catch you soon.  and if not, you know where to email me.  it may be easier.  heh.  by the way, i'm sure the weather on the vineyard is great right now, so i can't imagine my telling you that it was 55 degrees at 11pm here would have any effect on you.    that's all for now.  more later.  much, much more later.

      tomorrow i'm going home and wednesday i leave for san francisco.  i'm very excited.  although right now, i'm about knee-deep in dirty laundry that needs to be done so i'll have things like clothes for my trip.  not that i normally wear clothes, but i figure i should at least wear them on the airplane and to the auditions.  so i'm doing laundry.    my stomach hurts.  i hate my stomach, and evidently, it's none too fond of me, either.  and i'm tired.  and i'm clearly whining.  stop that, jim.  i guess today's just a funk day.  understandable considering the weekend i just went through, but ill-timed, nonetheless.  i need to get my act together for san fran.  i can't wait to get there.  it's supposed to be in the low-mid 60's the whole week i'm there, which i certainly appreciate, as i just saw a few snowflakes through my drawn blinds.  i wish new england weather could make up its mind.  the "lion" part of march is over... time for the "lamb" part.    more later.  blah.

      I... am exhausted.  We saw a bunch more auditionees today for the Sound.  Brings our weekend total to within a couple of 50.  And we trimmed the weekend's worth of auditions down to 5 contenders.  It's going to be a really hard decision.  They sure aren't making it easy on us.  So after my week in San Fran, I'll return to a hellish night of decision-making.   Week in San Fran, night of decision making.  Week in San Fran, night of decision making.  I'll survive.  A couple days of duty and a week's vacation during which I'll see a city I've never seen, an ocean I've never seen, an old prison I've never seen on an island I've never seen...  Yeah, I'll take it.  Free vacation.  Had a really frustrating conversation with a friend tonight.  Brought up a topic that has all of a sudden become very touchy for me.  I'm such a winner.  Gahd.  So the Harmony Sweeps finals are lining up.  I won't say much about the NYC regional except to say there was a huge collective sigh of relief from Groove when neither Duwende nor the Exboyfriends won in NYC.  However, I'm told the group that won just blew everyone away.  Was incredible.  So now we're looking at Chapter 6, who won the ICCA finals last year; 2x2, the new incarnation of the Georgian Six who made a strong showing in Boston last year and won in NYC this year; III of a Kind, a trio from the Phillipines; the Tone Rangers, a group from the DC area about whom I know very little; and Groove.  Woo.  Gon' be a fun time.   I'm off to bed.  Melodia just got home and we got a chance to talk for a bit, which was nice, because I've missed her dearly.  But now I'm really exhausted.  So I'm off.  But I'll leave you with one final thought:  My arrangements are going to be performed at Lincoln Center.  Who wants to touch me?  (can y'tell I'm a little excited?)  lates.

      Much to relate, not a whole lot of energy.  So here comes the SportsCenter highlight reel of the last... can it really be 13 days?  Gaaaaaah  So Groove competed in the Boston regional of the Harmony Sweepstakes on March 9th.  Groove has only been together (or had) for about 6 or so weeks by the time competition rolled around, so we certainly were the dark horse in this competition.  We won.  We're going to San Fransisco for the national finals May 4th.  Word.  I can't really get into explaining the competition here or talking about the show much.  I'm sure I'll be in better shape to do so at a later date.  Right now, my stomach's killing me, so less is more, I'm afraid.  If you want more info on what the Sweeps is all about, click the link to the left.  Groove's pic is finally up on the Boston page, so drop in and check it out.  Speaking of Groove... our new website should be up and running soon.  Click the link to the left, or point your browser to www.grooveshouse.com and check out our web-crib.  Life's good.  I went home for the last 2 days to see family and ended up watching 4 movies with my sis.  What were they.  Um... (sorry... momentary annesia) Zoolander (awful), Princess Diaries (coulda been cute if they'd cut a half hour off), Save the Last Dance (I'm evidently the only person who hadn't seen that one), and Bridget Jones' Diary.  Yes, there's a heavy chick-flick influence there.  Deal.    My sister is amazing.  'Nuff said for now.  That girl is incredible.  And single.  And beautiful.  Guys?    The OTR boys are competing in semifinals tonight.  At this time, they've already completed their set.  I'm really excited for them.  They've come so far.  I want them to do well.  I'm nervous.  They drew the #1 spot in concert order tonight.  Ew.  No one wants that.  Especially a group who has a legitimate chance at winning.  Well, it remains to be seen what the judges think.  *crosses fingers*  My stomach hurts.  Screw you, stomach.  Who asked you, anyway?  We auditioned about 27 guys for the Hyannis Sound today.  What a looooooong day.  There were a bunch of really solid candidates.  Really solid.  This is going to prove to be a really hard deliberation process.  And the total for auditionees this year has hit 90.  And it's loking more and more like there are only going to be 4 spots open.  Those aren't good odds.  But two guys are already pretty much selected.  (ssshhhhhh...)  And tomorrow we see another 20-something.  And next weekend in San Fransisco, I see another 13 or so.  And after that, everyone's just gonna kinda blend together.  I was kinda bummed that at the end of today, we decided to pare the day's auditions down to a shortlist of 5.  NYC sent us 4 out of their 13.  So we've got 9-10 guys to consider with another 35 live auditions and a bunch of videos left to evaluate.  Waaaaahhhhh... anyone wanna be us?  C'mon.  You know you wanna.  I was supposed to go see this really fantastic band tonight at the Chopping Block near Mission Hill... but I didn't have the energy to.  I know, I know... waaahhh... whatever.  The band is great, though.  They recorded at Renaissance Wednesday.  Ben Folds with a slice of Soundgarden.  Kickin' songs.  They're great.  Mechanical Shark Head.  Check 'em out if you can.  Last week I saw Time Machine with Groove the night before competition.  The only advice I can give to people considering seeing it is not to.  Your money would be better spent on pretty much anything.  The movie was quite possibly the worst I've ever seen.  All of us nearly walked out.  Bahhhh...  I think that's going to have to be it for now.  Katrina's calling me.  Ohhhhhh my goodness.  So yeah.  Couple long phone calls.  I never do that, but tonight I was in a talking mood.  So talk I did.    OTR is going to Finals.    WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?  They got second at the semis at Stanford tonight.  BYU Vocal Point got first.  Finals are at Lincoln Center on Sunday April 28.  Sunday.  BYU is a Mormon school  They're not allowed to take part in events of any sort on Sunday.  Hence, the school-affiliated Vocal Point boys cannot take part in the finals.  So On the Rocks goes in their stead.  My boys are going to the Finals.  I... have no idea what to do with myself.  Very excited.  I'm listening to Jeff Buckley.  Amazing.  "Everybody Here Wants You."  Beautiful.  When I think of the unwritten music that died with him, I can't help just being so saddened.    Dyl just came home and we talked about the auditions from today.  I think some of the "finalized" decisions today should be reconsidered.  We were tired.  Errors may have been made.  There's one kid in the final considerations from today who I will not be able to live with, and one who was eliminated who had perhaps the best ear of the day.  And a pretty kickin' voice and personality, too.  Whatever.  I'm tired.  I need to go.  Thank you for calling, Melody, dear.  I've missed you.  I'll talk to you soon.  For now I've got to get sleep so I can catch that blasted bus over to BC to sit in on day 2 of auditions.  Second day, same as the first... little bit longer, little bit worse.  Nah.  It'll be... fun-ish.  Enough.  Kristin, I hope you're feeling much, much happier.  I don't like it when you're not.  Margot, I hope you're feeling much better, as well.  I'm so sorry about today's... incident.    I'll talk to you all tomorrow.  Happy St. Patty's Day!

      aaaaaand we're done with auditions.  thaaaaank goodness.  i've seen all the auditions except nyc, and i've seen some pretty great stuff.  thursday night should be really tough.  but i'm excited.  can't help but be.  hs 2k2 is within days of finalizing.  cape fever is very much in the air.  take me now, cape cod.

      is it summer yet?  can it be?  please?  i get back to boston in 4 days, the new hyannis sound is chosen the day after i get back, and they're notified probably that night.  after that, i just wanna move back down to the cape and get things moving.  if we assume that the new sound guys are notified on the night we told them (4/1), then there will be 54 days left.  ohhhh my goodness.  so the selection process is down to one guy from new york, 5 guys from boston, 2-4 guys from sf, and whoever sends in a good video.  and returning members must make their intentions known today, so soon enough, we'll know how many guys we're taking.  this is really exciting.  i wonder what rellz and roo finally decided.  it's so strange living in the same city as these guys and not knowing whether they're coming back to the cape or not.  although it's also pretty exciting... or will be when the email comes out.  fozz, slick, me... possibility of rellz, roo, and/or dyl.  it'll be a good summer, regardless.  we've more or less chosen two guys for sure... one from nyc, and one from boston.  the others are up in the air.  hmmmm... so the two guys tomorrow are the last auditionees in a reeeaaaaaally long audition process.  huge sigh of relief at 1pm tomorrow.  rest assured, there will be much rejoicing.  sir duke.  fuckin' right.  talk about a song i can get into.  word, jamie... word.  that's all for now.  i wonder if the email's out yet.  hmmmmm.

      The Sox are 31-13.  Sayin'.  Beat the Yankees 3-1 last night, bringing the season series to um... 4-1.  The boys of summer are playing over-.700 ball, which is, simply put, in-freakin'-credible.  Pedro is a beast.  D-Lowe is a beast.  Burkett is a beast.  Our top 3 are a combined 19-1.  Derek Lowe hasn't given up a home run in about 80 innings.  Is there anyone in the majors whom the Red Sox can't beat?  No.  Save themselves.  This season is very much in their hands.  They're off to their second-best start in history and the Yanks are still trailing but a paltry 2 games.  Granted, we can bring that to 5 games   if we sweep the series.    7-4 without Manny, who'll be back in 2-4 weeks.  When he was injured, he was the league's top hitter and RBI man.  One can only conjecture what his return will bring to the team, who is already destroying the field in the majors.  I'm crossing my fingers.    It's a beautiful day and at the end of it, I'm moving to the Cape.  I'm not sure it could be more perfect if it tried.  Summer #2 with the Hyannis Sound.  Game on.

      Hair is cut.  Clothes are not packed.  Laundry is not done.  Nothing is, actually.  Today has been a really crummy day, overall, but Derek Lowe pitched 8 2-hit innings, and lowered his ERA to 1.90, and raised his record to 7-1 and the Sox dropped the White Sox 9-0, so that took some of the edge off.  I'm not really sure what to make of all the things that went on today, but I think I'm okay with pretty much everything, with the exception of the last little bit.  I can let a lot of things slide... I do on a regular basis.  I can deal with people talking about me, casting aspersions, being petty and whatnot, but I won't tolerate people lying to me... especially people I trust.  No one should stand for that sort of thing.  And though it hurts and part of me would rather just forget it happened, I think I'd be doing myself an injustice if I just forgave this person.  It was a very deliberate lie that carried on for a year, and even now, she's denying it... but the honest to goodness truth has been corroborated by several people who know this person, and there can be no denying it.  SO... I'm just very... let down.  I trust people too easily.  I let people in too easily.  And now I see why everyone told me to be careful.  I'm planning my road trips for the coming year.  Two 2-week trips, if all goes well.  The first one to Cape Breton, London, Amsterdam, and Prague.  The second, to Moscow, Geneva, Athens, and Istanbul.  Hopefully the first will be in mid-September, and the second in... probably early April.  Right after HS Tour.  That will be amazing.    I'm going to go for now.  Don't be surprised if I write again... i'm trying to get back in the habit, and the best way to do that is to go nuts with it at first, then ease off.  At least for me.  I dunno.  Til next time.  May the Road...

      Ready?  Go.  Sorry I've been absent for a long time... things have been happening too fast to document.  Quick capsule update, and then onward...  Hyannis Sound took 4 new guys.  They're all amazing.  Victor Sandman from BU, Greg Binstock from Tufts, Mark Manley from UVA, and Aithan Shapira from Brandeis.  This is going to be an incredible summer.  Countdown, for the record, is 4 days.  Speaking of the Sound, an abridged version of the 2K1 group did 2 shows this past weekend in Falmouth with the Falmouth Mostly Men's Chorus and Notescape.Cod  We had a lot of fun, and it was the last show any of us will perform with Jason Taylor (JT) for 2 years and 3 months, as he leaves June 18th for a stint in Belize as part of the Peace Corps.  Amazing party for Heidi/Bonk's birthday on Friday night at Coogan's Bluff in Faneiul Hall.  Considering the number of Hyannis-types who live in the Boston area, we don't get together NEARLY enough.  4 days til the reunion of the century.  Year.  Whatever.  Groove went to SF to compete in the Harmony Sweeps finals.  The competition was incredible.  The people were some of the most genuine and wonderful I've ever met, and I've developed a new love affair with San Francisco. (although I don't think I'll ever develop a similar love affair with the plane ride out there until the Concorde is in my price range)  We did not win.  And I don't think any of us cared.  It was an incredible show to be a part of... a career experience for all of us, I think.  The audience?  I defy you to find a better one.  They were so energetic and supportive and... just... wow.  Speaking of competition, I went to the ICCA finals in NYC on April 28th.  On the Rocks, the group I worked with in Oregon placed 3rd in the nation in their second year of existence.  Another career moment for me, hearing my arrangements sung in the indescribably beautiful Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center.  The show was amazing; the groups truly rose to the occasion.  And the record-shattering audience was again, wonderfully supportive.  Speaking of the ICCAs (this string of transitions is truly masterful, is it not?  No Jim, it is not.  But carry on...), I won the job I was interviewing for.  I'm producing the Northeast and New England/Central Canada regions for the ICCA next year.  8 shows, and interest from hosts and competing groups who've never shown interest before... I'm very excited.  All in all, it looks to be an exciting year for me and the ICCA. ::knocks violently on wood::  I'm also in charge of selecting the performing groups for the two biggest a cappella shows in the Eastern US this year: the Collegiate Showcase and the Gala Concert at the East Coast A Cappella Summit.  Stay tuned for more details, but don't be surprised if you see Australia's finest, The Idea of North, and Juno-winners Cadence in the Gala lineup. ::grinning ecstatically::  4 days til the Cape.  That means lots of packing to be done here.  And I need a haircut.  And to do laundry.  And to go home and see Mary, because she's going to be gone all summer and I'm going to be gone all summer and I'm going to be busy all fall and she's going to be in Moscow all spring and... see?  Need to see Mary.  I'm planning a trip to Cape Breton.  I can't wait to go.  It's been a secret little dream of mine since spring break freshman year at UNH when I met some folks from Cape Breton at a pub on St Patty's Day in Quebec City.  It seems like paradise on Earth, and I can't wait to escape up there for a week or two in the fall.  Early indications are that my good friend Jesse will be joining me.  She'll be studying in Montreal in the fall and Geneva in the spring.  Looks like I'll be travelling to Russia and Switzerland in the spring.  Woohoo!  Hopefully I can squeeze London in, too.  Oooooh... Bobbie will be in London in the fall.  Bingo.  World traveller, baby.  World traveller.  I think that's all for now.  I'm about ready to burst.  To the people of San Francisco, I love your city.  To the people of Cape Cod, oohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh my goodness 4 days.  Get ready.    May the Road...

      Alright, so things are better.  I don't know how they are, they just are.  I had a profoundly mood-altering conversation with a new friend, and it sorta put things in perspective for me again.  Yes, I'm sick of being weak and predictable.  I'll get over it.  I always do.  Today is our second day off of the summer, and it's... raining.  Gah.  Well, not raining yet... but overcast and on the verge of rain.  Oh well... plenty of good stuff to do while it's like this.  Tonight, I'm going to the Barnstable County Fair.  I've never been to a county fair, but I'm told they're fun... and I'm definitely up for fun.  We might go deep-sea fishing, too... that could be fun, as well... but I need to go to the mall.  Anyway, that's all for now, I guess.  The wine and cheese party at the Sound house last night was fantastic... my new favorite party of the summer.   And apartment hunting is turning up some fun prospects.  That's all from me right now.  I'll write more later, I'm sure.  Hope all is well with you.

      I'd love to get out of this funk.  Any thoughts?  Anyone have news that might revive me?  Blah.    Chatham tonight.  That's pretty great.  We did a free show for 450 people there this past Sunday, so we're hoping that packs our Thursday night Chatham show, as well.  I'm out.  Just wanted to check in.  Grace = gone.  Ooh... cool Kierkegaard quote---  "And the people crowd around the poet and say to him, 'sing again soon'--in other words, may new sufferings torture your soul and may your lips continue to be formed as before, because your screams would only alarm us, but the music is charming."  I realize the last 24 hours worth of entries have made it seem as though I'm unhappy.  I'm not unhappy.  It's a weird thing to describe... everything in my life is as I want it to be.  I'm doing the things I want, I'm moving ahead at my pace and doing the things I need to do.  My friends are wonderful.  But there's that one little thing that's missing, and that not-so-little thing is really becoming crucial now.  Whatever.  I'm done.  I'll write more later.  Call is in an hour and I haven't eaten yet at all.  Save two Dole raspberry popsicles.  Mmmmmm.

      "Excuse me please, one more drink.   Could you make it strong  Cause I don't need to think She broke my heart My grace is gone One more drink and I'll be gone.  One more drink and I'll move on." --DMB "Grace is Gone"  The tricks your heart plays on you when all you need to hear is "I'm over her this time."   So it tells you what you want to hear.  Then it drops the truth on you all at once.  Fuck.  Same old situation, same cast of characters.  You'd think at some point it'd get old.  Game on.

      Few things fill me with more anger than seeing a perfectly wonderful young person be tormented by his/her parents.  Case in point, a good friend of mine from... not the Cape, but soon to be Boston (the vagueness is intentional, of course, to preserve anonymity)... IMed me today and asked me to do her a favor:  "Tell me I'm a good person and that three weeks will pass quickly."  The fact that said person could ever need reassurance that she's anything but wonderful is heartbreaking to me, and the fact that her need to be reassured comes from her shaky relationship with bitter, malicious parents is a predictable but immensely frustrating addition to the plot.  This girl has, in 5 short months, managed to become a very close and trusted companion, whose words have been a comfort to me when I needed to hear that  I , too, was a good person and that things were going to be okay.  And so needless to say, I felt the need to come to her rescue tonight.    Luckily, I was able to reassure her that in three weeks, she'd have a support base the likes of which she's never experienced at her fingertips, as well as being smack-dab in the middle of a vibrant, wonderful city that's perfect for a girl like her to figure herself out in.  If you're reading this, dear, I promise you everything will be okay.  Do what we talked about and let me know the result.  Ignore the notion that money is an obstacle and do what you need to do.  If this opportunity is indeed only for this one semester, sign up immediately and don't think twice or apologize for it.  And then tell me.  Everything's going to be fine.  As for me, I can't be so sure.  But that's another story.  Mary J, sing it, girl...  "no more drama in our lives."

      I... don't know what to say/do/think at this point.  My frustration at this point comes equally from the realization of my situation's baffling parallel to the story of Sysiphus and the fact that I should grow up and be happy with everything in my life that's going exactly as it should.  Plenty of people have it worse than I, and yet I find it necessary to continue letting one person dominate my entire emotional state over the course of 3 or more months.  And it sucks... because time has proven that there's absolutely nothing in this world or any other that I can do to change my situation aside from getting the hell over it.  For once, you'd think I'd just do what's right for me instead of being the idiotic dreamer I insist on being.  Everything works so well in my mind that I can't imagine things happening any other way.  "The predictable is the thing I am incapable of predicting."    I quoted that in my livejournal back when I used to keep one.  It's a quote from this book, "The Fundamentals of Play" that was billed as the Great Gatsby for the end of the 20th century.  It was a great book, and the paragraph surrounding that line rang bafflingly true to me.    Whatever.  I'm done.  Today's been one of the weirdest in recent memory.  It's time for it to end.  And I've got rehearsal in Boston at 1.  So yeah... time to roll.  G'night.

      I'm going to collapse.  This past week has been so exhausting.  I've been moving my stuff from the Cape to NH and to Boston, and from Somerville to Winthrop, and sitting in traffic from NH to Boston and the Cape to NH and everywhere in between... and today, we moved Mary down to Wheaton before continuing on to the Cape, when I loaded up the remaining pieces of my Cape Cod life into a UHaul truck that dad and I are taking up to Winthrop tomorrow, then unloading, then driving back to NH.  Then (yes there's more) I'm taking stuff from NH to Winthrop one last time before settling in at my new apartment at 1 Coral Ave, Winthrop, MA.  So there will be a giant sigh of relief followed by several days of sleep once I reach Wednesday.  I don't know what to do with myself right now.  I'm no longer talking about packing/moving/cleaning.  I'm talking about guy-girl stuff.    First off, no one who knows me would ever accuse me of being a relationship guy.  The sad irony of that is that I crave that closeness and that feeling of belonging and all that good stuff... it's just that right as I get to the point where I could enter into a relationship with someone, I shut off.  I lose interest, or at least I tell myself I do.  It's awful.  So first of all, I'm not over this pre-existing situation that's been such a giant let-down for so long.  I understand that once again my friendship gets to take a backseat to the guy of the moment, and I'm starting to deal with that.  In the process of getting hurt myself and realizing that I'm forever locked into this cycle, I managed to hurt someone I hold very dear to me.  She and I need to talk.  We're gonna talk, you.  Very soon.  And now there's Christina.  The situation with Christina scares me because I can't find a thing wrong with it.  Every time I get close to a girl, I find some way in which she can't stand up favorably to the one I always use as the standard (is this making sense?  please bear with me, as I'm well past exhaustion and into delerium).  Well I've caught myself trying to find excuses... those little unconscious processes I go through to give myself an excuse not to fully open myself up to someone.  And for once, I haven't found any.  And I'm thrilled.  And frightened.  Because now I'm really on the verge of something wonderful, and I'm terrified that I'm going to mess it up.  Gah.  I want to be in 3rd grade again.  I want to give a girl a piece of paper that says "Do you like me?  Check one: __yes __no __maybe" and have her check yes, no, or maybe.  Then I want to go with her to a junior high dance and dance slightly less than arm's length away from her while making awkward small talk and trying my hardest not to step on her feet.  Is that too much to ask?  I miss Mary.  And I love my friends.  Slick is moving to Boston.  How cool is that?  Now we just need to get Fozz and we'll almost have the whole Sound there.  More later.  I'm thinking a quick nap wouldn't be the world's worst idea.

      I am the most masochistic sonuvabitch who ever lived.  I'm serious.  Fuuuuuuuuuuck.  I hate her.  And I think I really do this time.  I'm not bluffing.  I'm not going to get all sentimental and weak.  I'm pissed.  Really fucking pissed this time.  And to hell with the Boston Ballet, too.  Picked a bad fuckin' week to mess with my friend, y'bastards.  The boat's great, though.  Workin' a lot, lovin' it... new apartment's amazing.  As soon as I get over my deeply-rooted fucking hatred, I'll be able to fully enoy it.  No.  I'm fine.  Really.

      This from the bipolarity file ::looking at last entry::...  Last night was one of the best in recent memory.  Seriously.  Wow.  Here goes...  So this past week, I worked a lot.  a whole lot.  Ended up doing 4 straight doubles, Thur-Sun.  Lots of fun, lots of money, both of which I enjoy greatly.    Saturday night was an interesting night.  On deck 1, there was a 21st birthday party for this girl.  The party consisted of 5 very attractive girls and one very lucky guy (who quickly became the envy of the boat).  About midway through the cruise, I went down into the bathroom to wash away the sweat that was pouring down my face.  In walks the guy.  "Hey.  Y'see those girls I'm with?"  "Everybody's seen those girls you're with."  "Well one of 'em, it's her 21st birthday.  D'you have a girlfriend?"  "No."  "Well, she... she mentioned you.  Would you dance with her sometime tonight?"  "Yeah, of course."  And thus began a really interesting night (made even more interesting by DJ Dan's relentless effort to make a love connection right there in front of everyone.)  So at the end of the night, we exchanged numbers.  Dyl and I walked to Gov't Center so I could head home, and she called.  So we went out last night.  It was fun.  She's fun.  We had 3 and a half hours of interesting conversation, a nice, filling dinner, and a nice walk back to Gov't Center from the North End.    It was a great night.  Helped take my mind of the things that have been bothering me lately.  Entirely.  Well, here's hoping it keeps up. ::crossing fingers::  We may go out again tonight.  Say a prayer... this could be good.

      So yesterday was perhaps my most productive in recent memory.  I think because I thought I had to work and found out I didn't have to, I felt compelled to do some sort of work anyway.  Well, whatever the reason, I got pretty much everything done for my Berklee application, and so I'm really excited.  I had to call the College Board to have my SAT, SAT II, and AP scores sent, and had a rather disappointing experience.  See, because I took them more than a year ago, they were in the archive.  Archive.  They told me my scores were in the archive and I couldn't help picturing my scores on yellowing, dust-covered pages.  I know I'm not that old, but I felt old.  Having your College Boards forwarded in what should be my senior year in college... eh.  Whatever.  I have no complaints about the way things are right now.  It was just... amusing.  So the really exciting part was writing my personal statement.  That was my favorite part of applying back when I was in high school, and it's still the best part of the application.  There was no open response option, so I answered the question about career goals and how Berklee's curriculum and environment will help me attain them.  Woo.  And I wrote a song yesterday.  That was theraputic.  All these emotions that have been building up over the past 4 or 5 months, and little snippets of songs floating around... I sat at my piano yesterday and got it all out.  I think that helped, too.  lyrics, lyrics, lyrics... I love lyrics.  Here's a good set...   Moonlight Serenade- Kurt Elling Understand the night, when she flashes her sparkling eyes at dusk, she flirts with twilight. When the noise of day dies away, the night and twilight stay and stay making quiet love up high over the clouds. And the gentle twilight gives his light, making a queen of night. If I could, I would write a sonnet of the night as a rememb'rance of your eyes, And if you'd promise not to tell, I could whisper the words in the dark like a lover. We could count the stars--the shooting stars--and talk of lovers through the ages who had lived out of their dreams. Such will and spirit, courage they needed to live in a dream. To burn with every breath so serene, as if they had been the first to find love at all, Like night and twilight--they were the first of lovers ever. Could we be like them?  Hold on to one another until dawn comes?   Then we'd fly off and dream until night and twilight kiss again...  My love, my one and only love,  let me take you out under the moonlight, and show how the twilight loves the night,why he lives for an hour of loving through lifetimes of longing, and sings his moonlight serenade.    Good song.  Kurt Elling, man.  That guy...  So I'm worried that a friend of mine is upset with me.  I'm not sure whether this feeling is based in any way on facts, it's just a feeling I've got.  But I get that feeling a lot, actually, without there ever being a reason for it.  Blah.  Today's weather is disgusting.  It really is.  It's the kind of weather that could kill your motivation entirely, but it won't kill mine.  I'm going to go out and do... stuff.    For now, I'm also going to close this blog entry.

      Hmm... evidently I only feel the need to express myself once a week.    Now we all know  that's  not true.    So yesterday was interesting.  I was accused of trying to shoplift (oh yeah... me... really.)  I'm not going to go into that one, but believe me, there will be a strongly worded letter to the kind folks at Strawberries in Downtown Crossing.  And after that, I went to Borders (yes, I'm weak) and bought yet another book.  Yeah.  I know.  Stop me.  But this was excused, and let me tell you why.    So there's this Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer named Edmund Morris who wrote "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" (which is the book he won the Pulitzer for), and the new installation, "Theodore Rex," which I bought the other day.  So he's legit, right?  Right.  Turns out he also wrote a biography of Ronald Reagan.  ::gasp::  He... he.. what???  So this biography, "Dutch," was on sale at Borders for 7 bucks.  How can I, who loves these things so much, and even more, idolizes Reagan, not buy "Dutch" by Edmund Morris for 7 dollars?  Sayin'.  So then I went to the register, and while the young gentleman behind the register handed me my book, he said "Help stop the war in Iraq.  Have a nice day."  Excuuuuuuuse me????  Did you just spew your political thoughts from behind the counter of your employer's building?  I don't care what your politics are, that's unacceptable on every level.  And he said it in that obnoxiously smug tone that's come to characterize the self-declared intellectual liberal college movement, which made me almost reach across the counter.  But I didn't, because it took me about 2 seconds to register what he'd just said.  And I'd already started turning away.  But what the FUCK?!  You can't do that.  I'd like to think that he was saying it to everyone who bought a book from him yesterday, but I have this suspicion that he said it to me because I was buying a book about a conservative.  Either way, his manager will hear about it.  If the sides were switched and I, from behind the counter, noted his longish curly hair and he happened to hand me a copy of  The Nation , and as I handed it back, I said, "Help stop the hippification of America" or "Woodstock was 30 years ago, have a nice day," you can rest assured I'd hear about it in no uncertain terms.  As well it should be.  There are places your politics are irrelevant and inappropriate.  Your place of employment, especially if you're in a service or retail industry, is one of those places.    So I'm almost done reading "Whe Character Was King," Peggy Noonan's biography of Reagan, which will be followed by "Theodore Rex," and then either "Dutch" or "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt."  Haven't figure it out yet.    That's all for now.  Time to shower and get ready for work.

      Alright, look.  Let's be reasonable.  Philadelphia's too damn far away.  ::looks at map.  notes positions of Boston and Philly.  nods.::  We're just going to completely ignore this whole situation and be nice and reasonable for once in our damn lives, okay?  Okay.   I got my deployment assignment from the RNC, and I'm headed to NH to help Sununu beat the hell outta Jeanne "Do Nothing" Shaheen, and Jeb Bradley beat Martha "Income Taxes for Everyone" Fuller Clark, and Craig Benson beat What's-his-name (t.i.c.), and Charlie Bass beat Katrina-the-intellectual-midget-anklebiter-Swett.  There's work to be done, folks, and I'll be in NH from 10/26-11/6 doing the aforementioned work.    By the way (and I swear this is tooooootally unprompted.  heh)...  Meredith is the coolest girl--ever.  To explain that a bit further, Meredith knows--personally--Mike Port, the 2002 Interim GM of the Red Sox.  Meredith loves the Red Sox and the Patriots.  She actually knows what she's talking about when she talks about them.  She does like BC, though, which is far inferior to Notre Dame, but we all have our faults.  There are maybe a couple other things about her that are cool, too. (again, t.i.c.) Although she lives in Philly.  Which while a great city, is, as noted above... I digress.  So I bought more books.  Cripes.  "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt," by Edmund Morris (this is the volume that precedes "Theodore Rex," and the one for which he received the Pulitzer Prize), and "The New Thought Police," which is a scary book by the former chairperson of the Los Angeles chapter of NOW, who finally got sick of the sensitivity training and thought control bullshit the left has been using for the last 40 years to advance its agenda.  It's a rather heroic undertaking for this woman, having left NOW when she finally realized that the organization was too ugly and out of control for her to associate herself with anymore.  Anyway, I've decided to catalog my books so that I can keep track of them.  And oh yeah... Stacey (my roommate) and I are joining the Conservative Book Club (based in Louisville... that's right, Melody... they're coming to get you!)  Today I got to listen to 3 great radio shows (hold on to your skin)... got to listen to almost all of Rush Limbaugh's show, listened to the entire Howie Carr show, and got to catch the tail end of the Sean Hannity show.  Hat trick.  That's a really great day for a guy like me.  The left may have tv and movies, but we own AM radio, and that ain't bad.  So I don't know what I'm gonna do about these books.  I've got 'em lined up, and my birthday's coming up in a week, so I'll probably get a couple more then... which will back me up until New Years.  Well no, cuz I read rather quickly (and incessantly... on the T, on the boat, on the street...), so I'm sure I'll be okay, but damn... I've got 1200 pages of Theodore Roosevelt to read before reading about 500 more on Reagan, before finishing "Slander" and "The New Thought Police," before re-reading "The Shadow University"... get the picture?  Anyway, at least I'm filling my free time constructively, right?  Not slinging crack rock or gambling my life away COUGHRooCOUGH, so all in all...  I rewrote my personal statement for Berklee.  And I feel great about it.  The first version was really two-dimensional.  I was being foolish, and certainly not being nearly open enough.  And a guy who's been where I've been can afford to be open. (in fact, it'll probably benefit me even more to be open about my past, present, and future anyway)  This weekend should be fun.  A friend from the Cape is coming up and rowing in the Head of the Charles (actually, she's not rowing... she's a coxswain.  For Villanova.  That damn Philly connection again.), so the weekend should be fun, no doubt.  I'm also going down to Wheaton for a presentation on careers in music.  Hey, no matter how certain I am of what I wanna do, it can't hurt to hear more, right?  Right.  I'm worried about my Yia Yia.  The day after her 89th birthday, she had to go to the hospital.  They weren't sure if it was cancer or some other disease I can't remember or pronounce... but the woman is incredibly strong for her age, and knock on wood, doesn't suffer from the slightest bit of senility.  The woman's got spunk is all I'm saying.  And I adore her for it.  Know what the problem was?  They said her blood is too weak.  Know what they prescribed for this 89 yr old lady?  Steak.  hehehe.  That's my Yia Yia.  My family has all these incredibly strong people in it.  I'm happy to say that I'm pretty sure it rubbed off on me.  And okay, look...    Policy of the day: Election Law Evasion    Plaintiff: Honest and Decent People Everywhere.    Defendant: New Jersey Democratic Party (note for once I'm not indicting the whole damn national party)  The Defendant is charged with gross negligence of conscience as well as complete and utter disregard for the law concerning party nomination deadlines in the state of New Jersey. (which I'm tempted to refer to as a foreign country as it is.)  The Plaintiff will show that the defendant is guilty of the following abominable abuses of election laws in New Jersey:  1) The Defendant, after its candidate for US Senate withdrew from the race after the 51-day pre-election period, lobbied the Sumpreme Court of NJ to get a new candidate put on the ballot in the former candidate's place.  2) The Defendant, after being awarded the "right" to replace the now-resigned candidate, put in said candidate's place the candidate they believed was most electable.   3) The Defendant's new candidate has refused to participate in debates with his Republican rival.  The Defendant claims it is unfair to force its new candidate to debate when he has only been a candidate for 2 weeks.    4) In the Defendant's plea to the New Jersey Supreme Court, the Defendant cited the fact that "the voters of New Jersey deserve to have a choice in this election."    5) Though the Defendant has absolved its candidate of the responsibility to debate, it nevertheless has sounded the charge demanding that alternative party members seeking election to the US Senate in New Jersey be allowed to debate the Republican candidate.    In regards to 1), the candidate only withdrew when it became evident that the immorality with which he conducted himself put him at risk of not being re-elected, and thus put his party at risk of losing its majority in the Senate.  In regards to 2), their chosen replacement is a former US Senator from the state of NJ, who resigned from the Senate some years ago, deciding that politics was no longer something he wanted to participate in.  In regards to 3), evidently, the candidate is not expected to have positions on the issues in advance of election day, and is to be elected only based on his name and party affiliation.  In regards to 4), a) the Defendant ignored the 4 other candidates from smaller alternative parties who are also running for the US Senate seat in New Jersey; and b) What of the idea that the Defendant forfeited its opportunity to have a candidate on the ballot when its legal candidate resigned from the race?  In regards to 5), these alternative party candidates apparently did not exist in the original plea to the Supreme Court, but exist now, as the candidate wishes to play the equal rights card.  What about NJ's right to a fair and legal election process?  We, the people of the United States find in favor of Honest and Decent People Everywhere.  The New Jersey Democratic Party should be ashamed for its double-speak and law-dodging tactics.  How long will they wait to replace Lautenberg if he's elected?  A week?  A month?  And what of the precedent the court is setting with regard to the legal deadline for placing a candidate's name on the ballot?  May God have mercy on your souls.  Clearly democracy is dead in the toxic water in New Jersey.   That's all for now.  I'm exhausted.

      I'm heading back to NH soon.  I'm a little... nervous... about driving again, but it's a beautiful, warmish day and the roads are clear, so at least people won't be freaking out about driving on snow again.  I woke up this morning to find that the password I'd used for my aol account for 7 years suddenly is invalid.  Yeah.  Weird.  And every time I called AOL, I got disconnected.  I think there may be some sort of conspiracy going on here.  Bat Boy was phenomenal.  Sara was fantastic (and can we talk about the leaf bikini?  heh clicklicklicklick), as was the rest of the cast.  THey've been extended and will be at the Boston Center for the Arts again from January 3-January 25, so I'll be checking it out again, and you should, too.  I'm looking for internships in Boston right now.  Arts administration internships.  I've got a list of internships that the ART Institute has (bless their hearts- they number about a billion), and I'm going to look at the Wang Center, Boston Ballet, Boston Lyric Opera, Boston Symphony, Huntington Theatre Company, and whatever else I can find.  A wrench in the works with my Berklee-ness.  I got a letter saying they'd received my application, but that the spring semester is full.  I'm hoping I can talk them into admitting me for the spring.  Otherwise, I'll have to wait til summer semester and pull a Roo, commuting from the Cape to Berklee 3 or 4 or 5 days a week.  Fun, eh?  Not so much, but I want in now, and if that's what it takes, that's what it takes.  I haven't had time to read in the last 3 days.  Ew.  Gotta get on that.  Teddy Roosevelt awaits.  Funny conversation with Meredith last night, who was, shall we say... just a liiiittle bit tired.  Not funny "ha ha" mind you, just... funny.  Well yeah, sometimes it was funny "ha ha." :)  The next two days will see me jumping from NH to Boston about 5 times, followed by the start of my deployment assignment in NH for a week and a half.  Hopefully a little R&R, but what are the chances there?  Anyone out there a gospel fan?  I'm looking for some good gospel music.  Lyric time.  This one's Josh Groban's "To Where You Are" Talk about it.  Who can say for certain  Maybe you're still here  I feel you all around me  Your memory's so clear   Deep in the stillness  I can hear you speak  You're still an inspiration  Can it be That you are mine  Forever love  And you are watching over me from up above   Fly me up to where you are  Beyond the distant star  I wish upon tonight  To see you smile  If only for awhile to know you're there  A breath away's not far  To where you are   Are you gently sleeping  Here inside my dream  And isn't faith believing  All power can't be seen   As my heart holds you  Just one beat away  I cherish all you gave me everyday  'Cause you are mine  Forever love  Watching me from up above  And I believe  That angels breathe  And that love will live on and never leave   Fly me up  To where you are  Beyond the distant star  I wish upon tonight  To see you smile  If only for awhile  To know you're there  A breath away's not far  To where you are   I know you're there  A breath away's not far  To where you are  -----  And I'm spent.  Driving home in a few.  I'll write again soon.  Cait, call me if you read this and let me know if we're still hanging out tonight.

      This afternoon I went to lunch with Amanda and Danny from the boat.  We went to Cheesecake Factory in Cambridge, which is always a good thing.  Alright, I've gotta get something out, because it's really been affecting me lately.  It'll sound strange, but I can almost guarantee it'll be the last I speak of it.  I am in a rough spot right now for some reason.  Emotionally, that is.  Y'know those tests they did way back when they took two groups of newborn babies and gave them lots of attention and lots of physical contact and took another group of babies and just fed them and gave them what they needed to survive, minus the human contact and those babies like, died or something?  Yeah.  So I'm absolutely starved for physical closeness.  Sounds dumb, right?  But I'm a really huggy-type guy, and I like being physically close to people.  And I guess it's just not happening right now, and it's really affecting me.  Ugh.  It sucks.  OH!!!  And I almost got in what could have been a really horribly greusome car accident this morning.  No kidding.  I'm late for work (I work in South Boston), and I took South Boston Bypass Road off 93, and turned on to D Street in Southie and I'm driving along in the messy, freezing rain and muck, and this pickup truck pulls out across traffic (he had a stop sign, I didn't) from a street on the right.  And I'm inside 100 feet from him.  So I slammed my brakes and yanked the wheel all the way to the left.  I missed the moron, thankfully, and my dad's car did one of those 360's you see in like, Nicholas Cage movies... which would have been really cool if I hadn't nearly lost control of my bodily functions and watched my as-yet-not-terribly-long life flash before my eyes.  Holy frig.  And the guy just kept going.  Fuckin' a.  I'd have followed the bastard if I wasn't already 15 minutes late for work.  So that was my mortality moment for the year.  And that's all I'm writing for now.  I'm going to go see the lovely Miss Sara Chase in Bat Boy tonight at the Boston Speakeasy.  Should be fun.  I'm glad I got the chance to go.  She JUST called me this morning to let me know that she had two tickets available.  Bless her heart.  An early birthday present.  I was going to try to catch the matinee performance on my birthday, but this is even better.   Alright.  I'm really going now.

      Tonight I did a workshop for Not2Sharp, the new all-male a cappella group at UNH.  It was fun.  I got to hang out with Jamie (my freshman yr roommate and one of the most loyal friends I've ever known) and Danielle. (a good friend who now has a really badass job with the government while she's still a student at UNH.)  I'm arranging "Grey Street" for them, and sending them my arrangement of "Neon."    I went to a really great rally in Manchester last night.  It was an NRA rally and Charlton Heston spoke.  It was incredible.  I have not fel that energized in... forever.  And yes, Meredith, I know you're jealous, but it's all the more reason to stick around me during election years is all I'm saying.  Giuliani, Heston... c'mon now.  I've got someone on my mind, and she's not going away.  Gah.  Not that I really want her to... it'd just make things easier for right now.  Eh... whatever.  It's nice to feel like this.  So my time with the NHGOP starts this weekend.  It's going to be a good weekend for a bunch of reasons.  1) NHGOP, 2) Ellis's party, 3) Nate's cocktail party, 4) Sunday's an extra-special day :)... and 5) I get to spend time with my whole family, as Mary's coming to Boston for the party Friday night and will be home in NH til probably Sunday night.  Life's... nice.  I'm going to bed now, as I have to work a double tomorrow, and have to drive home after that.  Sooooo...  Oh yeah.  Thanks, Jamie, for my very exciting presents :)  They'll be on my computer shortly.  Muahahahaha.  Talk to you all soon.  IM me (JazzmnJim) if you read this and don't know me.  Since I have no other way of knowing how many people read this and my curiosity is... well... I'm curious.  That's all.  G'night all.  J

      Alright, this is going to seem tacky.  Maybe not tacky, maybe I don't know the word for what I think it's going to sound like.  Enough explanation.  Onward.  There's this girl whose blog I read, and it's so filled with passion and depression (y'know, she was just saying the same thing about someone else's livejournal, which is why I think this risks sounding tacky)... and it's painful to read.  Painful in that really helpless, cathartic sort of way.  It reminds me of all the angst I've been through over girls, just praying that the right one would finally come and find herself on the same page as me when she does.  But hers reaches a new level that I haven't had the chance to reach... this connection associated with a real relationship, and then having to say goodbye to someone for an undetermined amount of time.  I don't know how I'd do it, but I suppose first thing's first--finding that relationship.  She's also been through a very similar situation to me, and has similar regrets regarding it.  Only she was one of the participants in the relationship that was subsequently destroyed, and I was "the other guy."  I consider that moment my greatest regret.  My greatest failure of character.  My greatest disgrace.  And there's not a day that I don't think about it and wish I could take back the pain I caused.    On to something else that's been troubling me.  What politics does to people.  And there's something deeper that troubles me about it.  And by deeper, I also mean harder to explain.  Bear with me as I try.  So there are Republicans, there are Democrats, and there are a bajillion other "third parties."  For now, I'm going to stick to Reps and Dems, but I will say that I think some third parties have valid points to make.  Here's the problem from my standpoint.  Democrats in this country are vicious.  And they teach young democrats to be vicious, and hence, completely disrespectful of other views.  And that's the hypocritical thing about them... they say that Republicans aren't accepting.  They say they're all about inclusiveness, but it turns out that they only accept you if you share their point of view.  Which to even the dumbest person on earth smacks of hypocrisy of the highest and most shameless degree.  Intolerance?  Democrats are the kings and queens.  And they're conniving and manipulative, too.  They prey on emotions.  They prey on minorities.  They've got the minorities of this country convinced that Democrats are their saviors.  But what have the Democrats done for minorities?  Nothing.  Who made the big push to end slavery?  Republicans.  Who made the big Civil Rights bill push?  Republicans.  Who forced reform to the oppressive and destructive welfare system on minority-savior President Clinton at the risk of his re-election?  Republicans.  And have democrats elevated minorities to high office?  Not high enough.  Clarence Thomas and Antony Scalia are justices in the highest court in the land.  They're conservatives appointed by conservatives.  Colin Powell is Secretary of State, and Condolezza Rice is the most powerful voice on our National Security team.  Appointed by a conservative.  And the important thing to note here is that it wasn't BECAUSE of their race... it was because they were, hands down, the most QUALIFIED people to do those jobs.  That's another difference between the two parties.  Republicans seek a colorblind society.  Democrats seek a striated, color/gender/creed-aware society which rewards and punishes based on those categories.  They'll tell you otherwise.  They'll tell you that people are inherently racist/sexist/credist/elitist, and that in order to guard against the evil nature of these people, we need quotas, and entitlements and regulations on the books that "protect" minorities from discrimination.  The suggestion is as ridiculous as any of their claims, but perhaps is the most destructive of them all.    Anyway, as part of this elitism democrats subscribe to and pretend to abhor, they make a habit of berating conservatives for their beliefs.  Being a Republican is like a running gag with these people.  There's a huge stigma.  And there's a reason so many people subscribe to that mode of thought- it's easy.  It doesn't take any effort.  It doesn't take any courage at all to be a democrat.  You wanna be a radical on your college campus?  Don't be a druggie, a punk, a hippie, an anything else.  Try being a Republican.  That's where real courage lies.  It actually takes thought to be a republican.  It takes willingness to research issues and an ability to look beyond rhetoric and emotions and into the heart of issues.  It takes the ability to realize that emotions don't make effective policy, intelligence does.  Pragmaticism makes effective policy.  Tax cuts give more money back to people to invest in the national economy.  Small government allows people individual liberty.  National defense is crucial, and underspending on it leaves us vulnerable.  Welfare and affirmative action are demeaning and serve only to perpetuate people's circumstances.  The rich aren't evil.  They use their money to create companies which create jobs.  Denying that is ignorant and counterproductive.  The democrats have tried to turn this country against itself in terms of class warfare, and it's really an abysmal situation.  Jobs don't materialize out of thin air.  They are created, and not by the government.  They're created by the private sector.  So there's a choice here, and it's a hard one for dems to swallow, because it goes against everything they've been fed:  a) you can give money back to wealthy businesspeople so that they can invest in companies and create jobs, or b) you can take that businessperson's money from him in the form of higher taxes and give it out in the form of welfare.  One of those helps people reach their American Dream, one leaves their life a living hell.  (for those who would seek to evade this conclusion the correct answer is A equals American Dream, B equals Hell.)  And one thing I want to say to people in America who may be doubting the wisdom of a military strike on Iraq.  If we listened to the pacifists in the 1770's, we'd still be a British Colony. If we listened to the pacifists in the 1860's, slavery may still be alive in America. If we listened to the pacifists in the 1940's, Nazi Germany could have infected the whole of Europe and Asia. We learn now that the North Vietnamese were on the verge of pulling out of South Vietnam in 1968, but they decided to keep moving because they knew that the US was fighting dissent back home, and assumed that we'd cave.  They were right, and tens of thousands of soliders paid with their lives. If we listened to the pacifists in the early 90's, oil and gas prices could be triple what they are now.  Pacifists in this country are convinced that no one ever has to fight for freedom.  Now more than ever, the amount of freedom we enjoy here is the bete noire of tyrranical despots the world around.  Freedom is worth fighting for and it MUST be fought for.  Thomas Jefferson, who had to argue defiantly in the face of those 18th century pacifists, warned us, "The tree of liberty must from time to time be refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants."  He wasn't endorsing war for the sake of war.  He was acknowledging the reality of the righteousness of our country's purpose, and the hatred it would inspire from other nations and other leaders who fear the rule of individual people.   That's all for now.  I want to change the world, and I want to make them conservative, because the democrats as a political machine have been wrong on every major policy decision since the Great Society, which itself went a bit overboard.  Their track record is awful, yet they continue to gain support through devious political strategy.  Vote tomorrow, and vote Republican.  The Democrats are destructive and irreverent, and have no bloody clue how to run a country, state, grocery store, or anything else.

      So much.  The past few days have marked perhaps the most monumental moments in my life, 4 days that have been nothing short of miraculous.  A friend from quite a while ago re-entered my life.  When I met her somewhere around 6 years ago, she became the picture of everything I wanted to be, musically.  She remained very present in my mind for the next 4 or 5 years, and every once in a while would pop up somewhere I was- American Eagle when I worked there my senior year, a Hyannis Sound show my first summer in the group-and when she didn't know I was part of it, Hyannis Sound's alumni tour in Burlington, VT.  She spent this past summer in Tennessee doing music stuff, so she didn't visit the Cape.  Our mutual friend Sarah provided me with periodic updates on her status, and gave me her contact info (which, per usual, I promptly misplaced) and then she ended up reading my blog and getting my screen name and IMing me just last week.  And so it began...  She came to visit on Wednesday--my father's birthday--and we spent about 3 hours talking and walking up and down the beach near my apartment.  To attempt to describe the events of the last 4 days past that would be a complete and utter failure... it's impossible.  But I've been blessed with a new and overwhelming clarity in my life, and I have her to thank.  So thank you.  Thank you more than words can say.  "I'm so grateful for every heartache, and everything that came my way that I didn't want to happen at that time.  I thank God Almighty for getting me out of my own way."  In unrelated news, Meredith, you're in my heart and my prayers tonight.  And when you're ready or you need me, I'm here.  You know how to find me.  "You always told me what it is I needed to hear.  Not always what I wanted to hear, but what I need to hear..."  So grateful...

      This from the "Bald-Faced Dishonesty" File...  My sister is taking a class in International Economics at Wheaton College.  She showed me her textbook while we were home for Thanksgiving.    Now textbooks are technically supposed to be filled with fact upon which you can formulate your own opinions, and through which your professor can teach you all that is known to be true and theorized to be true, and debated over, and whatever else.    But in order for honest opinions to be formed, honest facts need to be presented.  The first line in a certain chapter in that textbook... this is not an essay, mind you...  is as follows:  "There is nothing inherent or natural about free trade."  I read it, and looked further, hoping to see, "...in our opinion."  I did not find that.  I found instead an elaboration upon this theme.  In order to teach a subject and have students for their own educated opinions, one must start with fact, no?  Evidently not.  The author of this extended opinion essay (which is all that book can be classified as now), evidently doesn't have any moral misgivings about disguising his or her opinion as fact for the purpose of educating students.  This troubles me deeply.  To say nothing of how troubling that one particular line is...  "There is nothing inherent or natural about free trade."  So tariffs are naturally occurring?  They fall from the sky, like rain?  So old alchemic practices should be revised to include tariffs as one of the base elements?  I don't get it?  When you import something, at what point does it absorb tariffs from the atmosphere surrounding it?  This author (or these authors) have purposely deceived students of international economics.    Free trade  IS  natural.  Tariffs aren't natural.  Free trade is the basic form of trade.  Saying that free trade is unnatural is akin to saying chocolate milk is milk in its most natural form.  Sure!  From chocolate cows!  Of course!  Cripes, people.  Open your eyes and ears, because people like this are writing your textbooks and your kids' textbooks, and they're teaching their opinion as fact from the pulpit of their lecterns.  Be aware, read the fine print, and don't let anyone tell you that taxes are naturally occurring phenomena.  If you believe that, you deserve to be paying 60% of your gross income, or whatever they want to take from you eventually.  Have a wonderful day.  It's beautiful here in Boston.  I think I'm going to run on the beach.  See ya.

      Read 60pp of Teddy today.  Really kind of a shocking amount, considering how little time I actually had to devote to it and two other intertwined factors: the density of the material and the chaos around me during the time I was reading it.  Nonetheless, I've followed young Theodore through his Harvard years and up to his engagement to Alice Lee.  Great stuff... he's really fascinating.  I'm looking very forward to the next 650 pages in this volume and the 800 that await me in  Theodore Rex .  Muahahaha.  Can't figure out what's wrong in my head right now.  Troubling.  Stop affecting me, you.  Jess is home!  Which means... I dunno... I suppose it means we'll get a chance to hang out soon.  Hope so.  It's been... well... too long... in actual months it's roughly 6?  *counts in head "June to July, July to August, August to September, September to Oct... yeah.  6"*  Gotta get up in waaaaayyyyy too few hours.  But it's going to be a fun day.  I'll cope :)  Talk to you all later.  Or some of you, anyway, as I have no idea who reads this thing.

      So tomorow starts a really long streak of work, which is great, because work = money, and that means Christmas presents and whatnot.  Anyway, tomorrow night and Saturday morning I'm working on the boat, then I'm heading off for three straight nights with Pure Energy... Saturday night at Gillette Stadium and Sunday and Monday... IIII dunno.  I guess I'll find out soon.  Then Tue AM on the boat, then Wed-Sat nights, and the Sat night cruise on the 21st is NOT one of the mutant 830-midnight cruises... it's 7-1030, so I can actually catch the T home.  How nice. :)  Still crossing my fingers about the Inaugural Ball, but my wonderful friend Jess has said she'd accompany me should the person mentioned in the previous blog be unable to come with.  Either way it's gonna be a great time.  Jess will, without a doubt, be a fantastic date.  Those friends of mine who spent this semester in London are home now.  So Bobbie, Steph, Court- call me, yo, so we can party in Beans.  My roommate Dawn and I talked for a little over 2 hours tonight, which is the longest time we've talked by a factor of 10, I think.  It was a great talk.  She invited me to come to her holiday party at the State house next Wed.  I'm working, but I'll see how this weekend goes, money-wise, and see if I can't afford to skip one cruise worth of pay to party with Jane and company.  Dawn, by the way, is a sweetheart.  Incredible sweetheart.  Both of my roommates are.  They're just great.  I hate crises, especially because I am one who is so NOT prone to panic over ANYTHING, and now it's becoming apparent that the ICCA is something that deserves to be panicked over.  Two host groups backed out of hosting the same show, and another group backed out of hosting another show, so unless in the next couple of days, two groups step up to host those shows, I have to cut 18 friggin' groups out of the competition.  Not fun.  Not fun at all.  Hence my away message tonight.  Why am I up right now?  gah.  Errands tomorrow, plus the ICCA crisis to deal with, and all of that needs to be done in the morning and afternoon because I'm working at night.  And I have to call Johnny.  DO NOT let me forget to call Johnny.  I don't care who you are or whether you know me.  IM me, call me, email me... DO NOT let me forget to call Johnny.  In related news, I spent part of today trying to figure out whether I want a Navi or an Escalade.  Any thoughts?  This is, of course, contingent on how frequently I work for Johnny... but I'm allowed to dream.  Especially when this position pays so bloody much.  *calculates how many round trip plane/train tickets to Philly he could buy with a single night's pay* *smiles*  Life is good.  And oh yeah- I got my acceptance to Berklee on Tuesday, for those who I haven't told.  So life really is very good.  Alright.  Bed.  After about 10 more pages of  The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt , that is.  Talk to you all soon.  DO NOT let me forget to call Johnny.

Only problem?  A certain someone who I'd have loved to accompany me there is leaving on a family vacation  that day .  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to This is Your Luck!  Heh.

      Things are going well, despite this crappy weather we've got in Boston right now.  Not sure that it's cold out, but it sure is rainy and gray and all that.  I'm coasting right along in the Teddy biography.  He's just made his freshman presence felt at the New York Assembly at the tender age of 23, showing deep contempt for and butting heads on a regular basis with "machine politicians" of all affiliations.  Someday, I'd like to be able to do the same thing.  I... will probably explain my thoughts on that later.  Suffice it to say, it takes a shit-ton of guts to do what Sen. McCain (a self-described T.R. Republican) does.  Not to say I agree with his particular positions (especially on restriction of 1st amendment rights), but I have a hell of a lot of respect for the fact that he does take a stand against both parties when he feels it's warranted.  Not to be confused with Sen. Jeffords, who's just a political asshole. (I don't know him, so I can't speak to his actual personality.)  So I work tonight.  I think it might be fun.  I dunno.  At least it's not an 830-midnight cruise.  And I'm going home, I think, on Sunday, which will be great.  I've got a lot of Christmas shopping to do... which reminds me- I have to call Maria.  I can't wait to get home... Jess, Jesse, Bobbie, Steph, Jeff, Corey... they'll all be home.  Feels good listing Jeff on there.  We haven't hung out in forever.  I don't think I really had confidence that we'd ever hang out again after freshman year... and I haven't stopped thinking about that whole situation since then. (It's mentioned in an ealier blog... can't remember when, but it's in there somewhere)  Every day.  I know I've changed so much, and I hope that some sort of friendship can still be forged, because he was the best friend I ever had.   Alright.  Enough.  It's Christmas.  Christmas is happy... and it's time for renewal and forgiveness and all that... and things in my life are  so  good right now.  So I'll just hope for the best.  The power of positive thinking...  Speaking of renewal, forgiveness, et all, after work last night, I stopped in at The Point in Faneuil Hall where a few Gent alums had sung earlier in the night, and were hanging around, getting ready to leave.  I got a chance to talk to Shawn Wagner, Mike Michaud, Brian Bouvier, and Jon Villeneuve.  Shawn and I had a really nice talk... he and Kristy are getting engaged soon, which is fantastic.  It felt good to talk with him again.  It had been a long time, and I can't even remember if the last time we talked was pleasant or not.  For a while, anytime I talked to either Shawn or Jason, I had severe filters on, and I think I forced everything into being negative.  But I've been thinking a lot about my time at UNH and with the Gents lately, and realizing that as part of that period of my life, which was the pinnacle of my self-hatred, I made it impossible for either of them to reason with me.  I wasn't open to hearing what they had to say, which in retrospect, were things I needed to hear.  But at the same time, because of the stuff going on in my head at the time, I  couldn't  have heard them if I wanted to.  I had too much going on up there to allow anything like that.  I was in a severe self-preservation mode, and with all the things crashing into eachother in my head, I was incapable of just playing along with things.  What a mess.  I hope that this is the beginning of those things being cleared up, because I'd really love to be connected to the Gents again.  Shawn invited me to come play poker with him, Jason, Jim Tremblay and a few others, as well.  Not that I have any idea how to play, but I can learn, and I think it would be fun to get together with a few alums and reconnect.  Alright, that's enough for now.  Weird feeling going on for me in regards to the Sound right now.  Something sort of brewing that I shouldn't have a problem with, but yeah... I do.  I dunno.  Maybe I'll talk about it with a couple of you to figure out whether I'm out of line or not.  Also looking forward to hanging out with a couple other people who are coming home to the Boston area from school.  Off I go.  More Teddy, then work.  Yay work.  Heh.

      (Well, since I said it to her, and it would really be dishonest if I ever forgot it, I want to post it here, so that you all can hold me to it...)   My friend Kat is really great.  Really, really, exceedingly great.  I'll tell you more about her once I take care of what I was talking about in the introduction...   JazzmnJim:  if I ever develop the temperment necessary to hold national office, Kat, I'll have you to thank for it  So yeah... if, in my acceptance speech somewhere down the line, I neglect to thank Kat Murdough, call my office.  I'll buy a 15-second commercial on TV specifically thanking her for sanding down my rough edges.  Okay, so besides her propensity for grounding me when I'm on an irrational political rant, Kat is a really spectacular poet.  And me saying this... this sort of thing doesn't happen often, and I'll tell you why...  I love poetry.  Love it.  But, in my splendidly biased mind has always been the unyielding opinion that everything that could/should be written in the poetic genre has already been written.  Longfellow, Whitman, Keats, Yeats, Byron, Frost... they did it.  They understood it.  It has always been my opinion that poetry written by people I grew up with, or who were around my age, was cursed to be either overly saccharine or histrionic, but undeniably a cheap knock-off of something that was already written a hundred times better by the aforementioned types.  That is to say, I don't like reading poetry written by people around me.  I stand corrected (is someone making a note of this?).  When Kat and I met through our mutual friend Melody, Melody told me that Kat was a poet.  "Great," thought I, as I rolled my eyes, "I'll try not to hold that against her."  Then Kat gave me something she wrote.  And then sent me something else she wrote.  And something else.  And to say that I've loved reading every word that Kat has sent me may  almost  do it justice, but probably not quite.  Kat understands me... probably too well.  And she doesn't let me get away with things she knows I'm too smart to try to get away with.  I won't explain that, but she knows what I mean.    All this to say, I've been blessed with many wonderful friends, and I'm forever thankful that Kat, to mention one specifically, is among them.

      Ahhhh... back in Boston.  I have my internet back, my city back... just in time to leave again. :)  I'm heading out into Boston today to try to find a day job.  I realize this will reduce my free time to absolute zero, but at least my bank account won't be there, as well, right?  Right.  So yesterday I scouted airfare to Louisville (yeah, Kentucky Derby!), Belize (yeah, Jason!), and a few other places.  And I had no way of knowing at the time, but after watching the video of Sasha in Kenya helping the Lost Boys, I really want to go there for a while.  Yeah, I know... me.  In Africa.  Weird.  Anyway, it won't happen, I'm sure, but it's a fun thoguht to entertain, no?  Mary's doing well so far in Moscow.  She's met up with a couple friends from the Middlebury program, and they're giving her, I'd imagine, valuable insight into what to do while she's there.  She's living with an older lady, much like our Yia Yia, who loves to feed her at all hours of the day.  Heh.  My friend Katie introduced me to some really great music last night... Joey Eppard.  Really awesome stuff.  I've been listening nonstop.  Check out "Static."  And anything else you find, for that matter.  Went to the Cape this weekend with Nate after the BU show.  Hyannis Sound board meeting was this weekend, so Slick, Rellz, Dave Petrelli, Judd, Rob, Townsend, Bonk, Mikey B, Largay, Dawg, Wrobz, and Fozz were all in attendance at Rob and Damia's house.  Great, great weekend.  Nate and I got there too late to catch Fozz and Largay, but were psyched to find Garvey, Garvin, Becky and Caroline there.  100 days to go.  Tomorrow we hit double digits.  Whaaaaaaaaaat?  Hyannis Sound audition info, FYI:  NYC:  March 15-16.  Contact Townsend Belisle-- townsend@hyannissound.com Boston: March 29-30.  Contact Jim Harrington-- jim@hyannissound.com  Thought I'd throw that out there for posterity.  Hanging out tonight with Bain and someone I apparently worked on a campaign with in 2000.  Should be fun.  I love amnesia... you meet so many great new people.  heh.  Alright... fairly recent additions to the good listenins list:  Joey Eppard Great Big Sea October Project  Enjoy those.  The current reading list:  The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt-- Edmund Morris (I swear I'm gonna win this one) What's So Great About America-- Dinesh D'Souza Bias- Bernard Goldberg Telling the Truth- Lynne Cheney The War Against Boys- Christina Hoff Sommers The 48 Laws of Power- Robert Greene  And various periodicals-- The Economist (for an invaluable global foreign policy and economic view... shattering the myths we've all become accustomed to believing), Reason (Free Minds and Free Markets), National Review, Weekly Standard, Atlantic Monthly, Insight... a few others, but those are the biggies.  Dunno why I put all that in here, but just in case any of you are trying to keep abreast of what I'm reading at the moment, there you go.  Okay... time to shower and go find a job.  Hope you all have great days... and evenings, if I don't talk to you.

      Y'know how everyone always says there's no such thing as a sure thing?  And y'know how you still believe that there really are sure things anyway?  Like sheer will can create situations that are agreeable to you?  It's time I get over that childish notion and accept reality.  There are no sure things.  Only luck, and hard work.  And even then, some things are left up to intangibles.  Call it the affirmative action maxim or whatever else you feel like calling it.  Sometimes, regardless of how many ducks you have in your proverbial row, you get it stuck to you.  And that's where I am right now.  Me, the optimism poster child... the "take 'em as they come" guy (at least in talking with my friends... never so much in my own dealings)... And this really sucks more than I can say.  Anyway, um... on the same day that this swift punch in the gut came, I got a really incredible email from someone I don't even know.  She reads this blog, and enjoys it... and took the time to say so.  And so V, thank you for making this day sting much less for a while.  I've spent the last 24 hours doing almost nothing but reading up on grad schools.  It's torture, because I have to wait to go... but it's great to know there are all these great programs out there when the time comes.  And come it will.  And I don't really hate snow.  I've been lying.  I want to go skiing.  heh.  But I need to go away for a while.  Away away, not ICCA road-trip away, because those aren't relaxing.  Cape Breton away.  Jesse, you with me?

I wanna be consequence free and just sing, 'nah nah nah nah nah nay ah nah nah'"  -Great Big Sea "Consequence Free"  Why aren't my full archives posted?

      A friend of mine had a great quote in her away message, and I thought I'd share it:  "In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends." -MLK  So important to keep your eyes and ears open... your real friends show their stuff when you're in your worst times.  You see too often that people lack the spinal solidity to do the right thing when they potentially have something to lose by doing so.    And you see the same thing on the global level, as well, although I shudder when I hear people talk about countries being our "best friends."  As I've said before, we don't have friends, just strategic alliances, and as strategy and national interest changes, so do alliances.  This is the way it is and always has been, with everyone, not just the US.  Global interests are addressed when it becomes clear that they overlap national interests, as with Iraq.  It is in everyone's national interest to get rid of Saddam.  But back in the whole MLK quote vein, this is what France and Germany are failing to see.  They're refusing to back us up, refusing to confront evil because, at least in France's case, they know that in the debris of war, the international community will find evidence of their arms sales and oil interests in Iraq.  Fine, France... we saved you from Hitler, we saved you from the rest of the world, and now you stick your nose in the air?  Don't be surprised if the next time you need help, you get a giant centrally located finger raised instead.  Sayin'.  I've been listening to Toto and Steely Dan nonstop for the last 24 hours.  "Rosaaanaaaaa, Rosaaanaaaaa"  Heh... Someone grew up in the 80's, and iiiiiit's me.  Okay, there's laundry to be done, and IIIII'm gonna do it.  I'll leave you with this bit of zen from last night's Hannity and Colmes...   Hannity:  The PETA people, the animal rights people, they hate you, don't they?   Ted Nugent:  Oh I'm so proud.  I couldn't be more proud.  Every time they speak up, I kill a dozen of something just for them.   God love Ted Nugent.  The man and his sporting association provided 20 million meals to homeless shelters last year... 20 million protein-rich meals through their hunting.  That's 20 million meals that the government didn't have to pay for or that a shelter didn't have to get grant or donation money for.  If that's not citizenship, I don't know what is.  God Bless America.

      Really weird right now.  Something's not right.  Anyway, lots of inquiries for Hyannis auditions, so I'm psyched... lots of talent coming in, and we're pretty sure 5 spots available, so that's... outstanding.  Looking at having to add Thursday and Friday evening auditions to the Saturday and Sunday all-day auditions just to see everyone.  Outstanding.  The Guru.  See it.  This weekend, ICCAs at Elms.  My last quarterfinal.  Then two semis and I'm done til April 26 or so.  Praise de Lo'.  The weekend of the 8th, an old friend from high school may be staying with me while she does an audition at the Boston Ballet.  Should be a lot of fun.  I'm really excited.  Something's definitely wrong.  My paragraphs are 1-2 sentences long.  Got more grad school info today... Florida State and Oregon.  The top 5 right now: 1. UCincinnati 2. Southern Methodist 3. NYU 4. Carnegie Mellon 5. American  ...with Indiana and Wisconsin coming in right behind those.  Really psyched to have stuff to look forward to right now.  Too much time out of school has left things feeling a bit stagnant at times.  But there's always the Sound to go back to every 9 months. :)  This weekend was a long one.  Drove to Burlington, VT on Saturday in a snowstorm for the ICCA show there.  Had a blast, hung out, met some great people, and stayed up there with Ky.  Was supposed to drive to UMass after the show, but the weather was too freaky.  Sorry, Seb... I was really hoping to see you again.  Anyway, Sunday morning, with my cell STILL blacked out (because the state of Vermont hates me), I drove the length of Vermont in freezing rain (took 2.5 hours) only to find out that the show in Northampton that Nate and I were singing in was about 5 hours earlier than I'd thought.  So Nate had cancelled us.  So I made it to the Pike and met Nate for lunch (after a bit of confusion), and we had a good laugh.  Then I drove the length of Massachusetts in freezing rain and got home around 6.  Then I laid down to take a nap at 7:30 and woke up at 8:30.  AM.  Today.  So 13 glorious hours of sleep, which is just about what I netted ALL of last week, then I drove home to NH and my father drove me back to Boston.  And that brings us to right about now.  Cait, hon, you're in my thoughts.  You know where to find me if you need me.  Ky, thanks for keeping me company for the drive to Burlington, and for letting me crash there.  Seb, sorry about not making it down to Amherst.  Weather sucked.  We have to hang out soon.  IR, yeah.  Miss ya.  France, shut up.  Notice how no one asks you your opinion on anything important?  That's because you're clueless.  And oh yeah, maybe if you weren't holding $4bn in IOUs from Iraq for the arms you sold them and hadn't succeeded in securing exclusive drilling rights to 2 of their largest oil fields, you'd be able to remove your 'tete' from your 'deriere' and do the right thing for once.  No such luck.  And I think that's it for me right now.  Nothing important is going through my brain right now, and that's a sign that it's time to count my losses for tonight and try again tomorrow. :)

      http://www.humanevents.org/articles/04-14-03/jeffrey.htm  France is positioning itself politically alongside Libya, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria and other hostile nations.  Villepin is doing more than harmless elbow-rubbing with his "counterpart" in Libya, again blurring the lines as to who he hopes will prove victorious in the Iraq War.  It's so hard to even picture it in this day and age, but continued conduct in this direction could eventually position France and the US as enemies.  Enemies?!?!  France and the US?  Can you imagine us going to war with France?  It makes me ill to have to think like that, but what the hell--it's their funeral.  For countries like France or Germany who have seen and been overcome by true evil at points in their recent history, to only a generation later be completely unable and unwilling to identify evil... a fool's error, to be sure.  They'll pay a severe price in the long run.  Frankly, I hope they choke.  I'm surprised at Germany... but deeply saddened by France.  They're just plain moronic.

      I'm sitting in the studio right now, mixing "Thriller" for the Hyannis Sound's new album,  Cape Standard Time .  It's beginning to sound startlingly like the original.  This is the part of the process that makes me really happy.  Well, I suppose this part and everything that follows.  I think holding the finished product in my hand will be the ultimate.  Tomorrow new guy Micah is coming into the studio to hang out and hear how it's all going.  Made me think about my first day in the Sound.  I drove up to the house at Long Pond, and "Billie Jean" was blasting out the windows and doors.  It was a beautiful day, and I walked inside and heard that playing ( 110  had just been mastered and sent off to the printer) and couldn't believe my ears.  Big, goofy grin.  Can't wait to see Micah's reaction to this new cd.  Or anyone else's, for that matter.  I've still got to redo the Vincent Price monologue at the end and do some funky spoken word stuff for the end, but the list of stuff left to do to "Thriller" is getting really short.  5 down, 2 to go.   Two thank yous are in order:  Abby, thank you again so much for IMing last night.  I've missed you and it was, as I said, really nice to know someone cared right then.  V, many thanks for your email.  I don't think I ever expected to hear from you again, but hoped I would.  Thanks for sending up a flare, and keep reading.  I'll try to keep writing for both of us.  Ha.  There are only 24 days left until I head back to Cape Cod for the summer.  Last summer was not the best summer of my life, even though I thought it would be.  My first summer in the group was by far the best, and I doubt if the range of emotions that helped fuel that summer will ever be duplicated--such a delicate chemistry, to be sure.  But I'm becoming increasingly convinced that if any summer had the potential to rival that first summer as the best ever, this one is it.  Our new guys are ridiculous, we've got a new house, new cd, new attitude, and what promises to be an almost entirely new repertoire. (bringing back only 10 songs out of 40 from last summer, and looking to add 40 new songs to those 10 to round out the summer repertoire)  So welcome, new guys, thank you, friends and mostly-anonymous readers, and fasten your seatbelts, Cape Cod.  We're back in the house on May 24.  Holy...  "In a world full of people only some want to fly isn't that crazy?" -Seal  Talk soon.

      I'm a masochist.  But I feel like I'm having fun otherwise.  I've never met anyone like me in that regard.  The pain is like this undercurrent that almost sustains me... it's as though it was the energy that keeps me going.  I'm exaggerating a bit.  The pain has sort of subsided on the issue I'm referring to... just every once in a while I flirt with the possibility of going back to the same old situation... it's like the movie  The Shawshank Redemption  and how they characterize the people who get out of jail after spending decades in it.  They are afraid to live outside those walls, outside their security blanket.  Well, for a long time now, that fear and pain and insecurity has  been  my security blanket, and I feel a bit like those freed men who wonder in their freedom whether they're better off where they were in the first place.  So much is going well right now, including this girl I'm sorta getting to know.  I worry that maybe the fear of trying something new (i.e. non-painful and reciprocated) might be causing me to subconsciously sabotage it.  That sounds familiar.  I think maybe I've done that once or thrice.  This girl, she's adorable.  If adorable were a person, adorable would be this girl.  She's just the sweetest person ever.  And she has the greatest away messages and profiles.  And the same two favorite books as me.  Crazy.  And then there's the other girl... who just doesn't go away.  It's not her fault she doesn't go away, it's mine.  Hell, I wonder if she even knows she's back.  I wonder if I'll make her stay around or let her go.  I guess I wonder a lot of stuff.  The new Hyannis disc is ridiculous.  Ri.  Dic.  U.  Lous.  I can't even describe it.  It's just some of the nastiest stuff I've ever heard.  24 days.  Lord help me.  So much is happening between now and then.  I hope I make it through relatively unscathed.

      SBG.  IR.  WTF?!?!  Ha... that'll make no sense to anyone who doesn't know who those abbreviations pertain to, but that's okay.  I'm only typing them in here because felt that I needed to at least acknowledge the confusion.  Today (er... yesterday) I had lunch with Christina, who I haven't seen or talked to in SO ridiculously long.  We had a great conversation, and I played her the new Hyannis stuff along with Roo's new demo.  Thanks, Christina, for feeling like you could talk to me about everything.  I'm always here. :)  I'm heading up to NH so that I can go with my family to my cousin Eleni's graduation.  My aunt is the commencement speaker... quite a controversial figure she's been of late.  I hope the crowd treats her well.  They probably will... Maine likes her a lot.  I'm relieved that she and I don't talk politics when we get together, though, even though something inside me is always dying to ask her a question about something political when I see her.  I love and respect her, and love that she's doing what she believes is right.  I just don't believe it's right... it's a tough thing.  But I do so admire her, and that's the important thing.  More later.

      Happy 5 de May.  Tonight I celebrated the Mexicans kicking france's ass.  Even I'll drink to that.  Sidebar: I think the US needs some sort of pseudo-official drink for its independence day.  I propose something foofy.    Cape Standard time is about as done as done can be (aside from "I Feel Good," but we knew that was gonna be the last one done.) and I couldn't be more relieved if I tried.  The track listing for Cape Standard Time (in no particular order):   Thriller Bohemian Rhapsody I Feel Good 72-Hour Daze On and On Fields of Gold 1000 Miles Sailing Your Smiling Face Fly me to the Moon Last Goodbye Walkin' Away A Parting Blessing L-Y Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay   Sounds pretty solid to me.  Can't wait for all of you to hear it (and you will all hear it... oh yes... you  will  hear it...)  It pretty much blows my mind.  So tonight I was out celebrating the national independence of our neighbors to the south and Jess called.  So random.  But I heaven't heard her voice in forever, and it was really, really nice to hear from her.  Thanks for calling, hon :)  Saw "A Mighty Wind" last night with Cait, Mark, Sara L., and Cait's roommate Jess.  Funny movie.    Chickened out today.  What's new there?  Per her request (and an incredible need deep inside me):   There's this super cool girl named Katrina Who's super fly--you shoulda seen-a She keeps me in line (At least some of the time) and I'm glad it's her, not someone mean-a.  Sank you, sank you... I am be here all zee veek.  Confused.  Thoughts?  (ha... notice how I didn't tell you what I'm confused about and still asked for your thoughts?  I'm good like that.)  Clearly tired, and with throbbing headache, I bid you all a fond...  zzzzzzzzz

      Last couple days have been crazy.  Fozz left to head down to Baltimore.    Friday night I went to the Simmons Sirens' concert, and met Wrobs there.  He convinced me (lots of arm twisting there...) to head down with him and Roo to Foxwoods to meet up with Mark Manley after the show.  Met Mark down there, watched Roo, Mark, and Wrobs kick serious blackjack booty.  We headed back to Boston, and crashed at Roo's place.  Saturday, got up and Mark and I headed back to my apt, where my roommate Dawn was busy moving out (anyone need a phat beachfront apt in the metro Boston area).  Wrobs came over, picked us up, and we went to Suffolk Downs to watch a little horse racing (most importantly the Kentucky Derby).  Then we met Greg Binz, John Clark, Dana Semmell, and Christy and Irene from Six Appeal at Vinny Testa's on Beacon.  We all had a great dinner and headed to Bonk's for a little get-together.  Vic showed up there, along with Matty Lane, Ed Boyer, and a whole bunch of BC Acoustics and Bostonians.  Great night, definitely.  Saw Kaitlyn again... wasn't sure I'd ever see her... turns out her comp was stolen (that's what I get for not using my phone).  Heh.  Night ended, Mark and I crashed at Roo's.  Got up this morning, had breakfast at Tufts with Greg, Mark, Ed, and Mike Flynn and spent most of the rest of today driving around between John Clark's place and Tufts.  That brings us to now.  Mallory, thank you.  Be in touch.  Everything's cool.  Mom and Dad, you're amazing.  I'll charge my phone and talk to you tonight.  Mary, you're in my thoughts every minute.  I hope you're safe and happy.  20 days.  The disc is incredible.  J

      Girls are not cool.  Well, ok, they're cool, but they suck a lot.    That's all I have to say about that.  Well, not really.  I'm pretty sure the person I'm writing this about doesn't read this anymore, so anonymity isn't of the utmost importance.  Anyway, I hate when feelings exist between two people and then over a not awfully long period of time, they cease to exist between those two people and instead one person is left doing all the feeling and the other gets to forget there was anything there.  That's the greatest.  Anyone out there want to not be confusing?  Give me a call at 617-...  Honestly, though, I've gotten more than enough signs this week alone that the person in question isn't meant to be anything more than a friend to me.  So word.  Whatever.  Onward.  To that which was already working in my life anyway... not sure why I let myself get distracted... probably b/c "that which was already working" is out of town.  That'll soon be remedied.  Angst angst angst angst angst... 10 days til I'm on Cape Cod for my third summer with the boys of summer (click the link for Hyannis Sound at left).  And then nothing's allowed to be bad.  Ever.  SBG, IR, whoever else... not gonna mess with my summer.  Hear me?  I feel so assertive.  Ha.  That'll be short-lived.  Alright.  Bed.  Now.

      two gigs in two days.  both college graduation parties.  the group is sick, the gigs are great, the weather sucks momentarily, but that will pass.  lots of conflict bouncing around that head of mine.  luckily none of it is about the group--this group is coming together like 2002 never did, so I can't help being absolutely beside myself at that.  new songs, new arrangers, great soloists, new house, new attitude, new beginnings.  we went to Micah's house in Randolph after the gig tonight in Canton.  he has the most beautiful, vibrant family I've ever seen.  gigantic smiles on everyone who entered the house--smiles that made you understand where the one he always wears comes from.  so much love and appreciation and good humor and craziness.  they're truly wonderful people.  his father painted (and I don't mean ran down to Sherwin Williams and tossed two coats of "antique white" on the walls) the kitchen and living room himself.  he was an art major, and in the kitchen, thee was this really great mural of a white fence, a shrub of some sort, and on the ceiling, clouds and blue sky.  last night, Ed, Collins, Vic and I had a really intense debate on just about every possible bad topic of discussion between friends, but we came out of it with an immense amount of respect for eachother.  then Collins, Ed an I talked about our college groups and our hopes for this year, and the flawed spectacle that is the Hyanis Sound audition process.  certainly food for thought.  then today, Vic, Collins and I went to the gym.  willy's gym.  what a great place, and literally right around the corner from our house.  we did legs and shoulders and abs and holy crap I'm in pain.  because what did we do after we worked out? the three of us sat crammed in the back seat of Micah's car for two hours to get to our gig.  cramps galore.  thank goodness there were no stairs involved in this gig.  i had a post the other day that i wanted to put up, but my computer froze.  i'll post it retroactively in the next day or so. (it's not a positive one, but i swear i'm over her.  no, really.)  right now, i'm off to bed so i can finish the arrangement of "the best things happen while you dance" and teach it tomorrow.    sorry for my sporadic capitalization tonight.  i just really didn't feel like pressing 'shift' a hundred times.  how's that for lazy? ;-)  may the road, jim

      I am a uniquely fortunate person, this I know.  I have led a fairly charmed life for the last 2 years, but something has always been missing.  I've always been stuck on the same old hangup--can't get her out of my head, that sort of thing.  It has caused me to waste a lot of time.  That's not the case anymore.  There's this other person, about whom I've written in these pages before, and she... well, she has changed me, whether she knows it or not.  She has made me care about a person so deeply and so consistently that it makes the labored feelings of the past few years seem an utter waste of time and energy.  This girl is amazing.  The other night I called her just because I needed to hear her voice saying something--anything.  I don't use the phone.  I hate the phone, which is why I've become an utter IM addict.  But that didn't matter, because I had gone through the whole day thinking about her and when I'd see her next, and I finally was at a breaking point and just needed to talk to her.  And I did.  And it felt so good.  I don't know if she knows I'm talking about her.  I don't know if she's writing about me in her blog.  I don't know if she reads this or knows I read hers.  What I do know is that there is something truly wonderful growing between us.  So thank you, you, for being.

      I wish I knew whether it was me you were talking about.  If it is, I'll be really, really happy.  If it's not, well, I suppose I'll just be.  How do you like that?

      I've got a confession to make.  I think about you far, far more than I ought to, and that scares me.  I suppose, then, that I had two confessions to make--the thinking and the anxiety.  Aren't you special?  You got two confessions out of me.  A party's about to start here, the first party this summer that I haven't been really excited about.  Maybe I'm too anxious.  Anxious about you, yes, but also my voice.  I think it's broken.  Yay for oversimplification.  You'll be here in not so long, and I can't wait for that.  Well, I can, but I'd rather not.  I like taking single thoughts and giving them two parts, or had you noticed?    There's so much I feel like I want to tell you, but I'm never really sure I should, or that you want to know about it.  I think that getting over self-doubt would be an important step toward not worrying.  Natch.  Party time.  More later, perhaps.

      V, are you out there?  I assume you like the anonymity that dropping in at random provides, so you don't have to respond, but I'm just curious.  I feel like I want to talk to you about stuff.  Off to sing at Bridgewater State.  Skydiving reservation has been made.  Need to grab a quick shower.

      I wonder now if I did the right thing.  I worry a lot, but feel like I have a lot to lose now.  So many question marks.  A week from today, I'm jumping out of a perfectly functional plane at 13,000 feet with Jess.  So much symbolism, so little literal translation.  At least she's made mention of it.  That's got to be good, right?  Or at least not bad?  What's important is she's thinking about it.  Oh, you thought I was talking about the Jess/skydiving thing?  The old jazz song was wrong.  It's not spring, but summer that can really hang you up the most.  Or at least for me.  Part of my world goes on pause while I spend three months 100 miles from Boston in a place that may as well not exist the other 9 months out of the year.  So strange... people, places, feelings, that can never be duplicated or fully explained outside the context of the Cape.    I hardly ever notice the part of my world that goes on pause for the summer.  I mean, I notice, but I don't worry about it, until this year.  This year, in the months before hitting pause, important and cautious developments happened.  I wish I'd had one more month before suspending it all in midair.    Maybe I don't need to wish things were different.  They're all as they should be, or so the theory goes.  How to accept that, though, when it seems like there's more that can be done?  I'm oversharing because it's late.    I got your "goodnight" IM tonight... missed you by a minute or so.  That's always the way, but that's no matter.  We'll talk soon enough.  Theme party in 4 days.  4 days?  And me with nothing but my mixers purchased.    Goodnight.

      I'm not sure why I'm up right now.  I'm really tired.  It's been a long day, and a generally emotional 24 hours.    There are many up-sides, though.  Like the fact that I spent today in Boston on Newbury St., and came home with new jeans, cd's, a backpack, and a day in the city I love behind me.  Dylan turned on the rebroadcast of tonight's Red Sox game after informing us that they won.  Then he watched a bit, then left, and now I'm here, watching the rebroadcast of a Red Sox game whose outcome I already know, and writing in my blog.  Those cd's, though, are great cd's.  I got them at Mars on Newbury St.  Two of them were used, one new.  They are, in no particular order--  Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Songbook Bill Evans Trio--Waltz for Debby Bud Powell--The Amazing Bud Powell, Vol. 1  Did I  mention  I'm addicted to jazz?  This guy I know who's going to Berklee in the fall with me brought me a little gift last night, a gift which saved me over $600 in sheet music for the next couple years.  Life is good.  Especially when you're saving money.  Speaking of money, which I don't often do, I'm fairly certain I've got my job on the Spirit of Boston back when I return to Boston in the fall.  I'm reeeeaaaally crossing my fingers, because I need to pay rent.  I'm going to go to bed.  Hoping for a phone call, but I'll live either way. :)

      I don't get why you won't let me just hate you and be done with this.  Miss you, yes.  For the same reasons as always, no.  It still hurts a lot.  Expectations are dangerous things.  I didn't expect to have to say goodbye this soon.  But good did come out of it... there was no downward spiral into the feelings of the past.  Instead, the time was slightly marred by some bad news that neither of us expected, but that nonetheless affects both of us very much.  Unfortunately, it means that now I have these other feelings of sadness about you, and that's fucking me up.    I miss you.  Thank you for coming.  It'll be okay.  Three years will pass, and our friendship won't be any different.  At least I hope not.  That's what's getting me through the initial shock.

      This week was an incredibly busy and very exciting one at Casa de Hyannis Sound.  This is our 10th year on Cape Cod, and so this week was our reunion week, with the 10th reunion show happening on Wednesday night.  We had 9 of the 10 original members, including 2 all the way from Kenya.  A total of 35 men took the stage that night, of the 43 who have been through this experience.  It has been a rather incredible week of storytelling, debauchery, and once in a while, even singing.  I've had a wonderful time, especially because, as I've noted at one or two shows this week, it's the one week this summer where my position in the group (historian/alumni coordinator) is relevant. :)  Samrat just called me.  He got a small speaking role on the Sopranos.  Dr. Singh.  The lip smack that Danielle and I endorsed so enthusiastically on Wednesday night was the clincher.  No joke, says he.  There are still so many people crawling all over this house.  We've had 7 visitors from Buffalo camping in our back yard for the last week, and it's gotten to the point where everyone in the house is generally frustrated, because there's no place to go in the house where you can be alone.  I like company sometimes, but mostly I just like being alone, or with one or two other people.  That's just how I am.  It's hard to think with a lot of people around, and I spend a lot of time living in my head.  Steph and Dre are coming to visit tonight.  Steph is a friend from high school and Dre is one of her sorority sisters from UNH.  The three of us are living together in Boston starting this September, and I'm very excited.  I've decided that I want to start working on my first jazz album.  Yes, my album.  I've been writing during the last week, and it's a lot of stuff that I'm actually really excited about for once.  Jazz.  Yay for jazz.  A few standards I'm dying to record, too: My Foolish Heart, Detour Ahead, Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most, Waters of March, Wait Til you See Her... it'll be fun.  Just gotta find some guys to play.  That's where Berklee comes into play.  Game on.  Tomorrow, you're coming to visit.  You already know I can't wait, but I'll say it again--I can't wait.    Tonight, Hyannis show and party, but first, we're playing mini golf and having dinner with the remaining alumni.  What a great day.  Choppy thoughts, choppy sentences, choppy blog.  Thanks for reading.

      "Now when I think of that broken-hearted fall, I'd give my all to have that moment      to speak again, to thank you for chasing a bluer sky--and to kiss again--      and to say goodbye...  Moments live in forever once they live, so we can give away our forever day, and it's no regret to say, 'that was yesterday' when we give away our forever day...  Time to say goodbye, to see what time can bring to love, It's time for me to try to see what life is really of, It's time to say goodbye..."  "Time to Say Goodbye" - music by J. Zawinul, Lyrics by K.

      I'll admit it.  I hate change.  I like it when I plan on it, but not when it just happens.  I'll go ahead and list that as perhaps my biggest shortcoming: the inability to cope with sudden change.  And so I'm affected.    But we're all affected... it's not like I'm the first person to be adversely affected by change.  So onward.

      The past couple days have been incredible.  Orientation at Berklee.  Sitting at the first orientation session with my dad, we were both bowled over by the number of students... all there to make the most ridiculous music the world has ever heard.  Not a bad goal.  That first day, among the many awesome people I met, was a jazz singer from LA.  She came from the same performing arts high school as Sara Lieb, who's this badass Berklee alum (a ripe old 21 yrs of age) who's got an album on Berklee's jazz label, and has sung with Kurt Elling (GAH!), Kevin Mahogany (GAH!), et al.  Anyway, she and I will be working together a bunch.  She was all excited that there was an entering male jazz singer.  Well okay then.  And yesterday was the day I was stressing about like mad... auditions.  Had to audition for ensemble ratings.  They rate you on a scale of 1-8 in 4 areas: vocal proficiency, sightreading, improvisation, and rhythmic interpretation, with 1 being entering student and 8 being Charlie Parker.  So after watching several really good singers come out with straight 2's, I was a liiiiittle scared.  Then I went in and fucked up the sightreading part.  So much for the part I  kneeewww  I'd nail.  Then I sang.  God, did I sing.  I was impressed.  Apparently they were, too, because I got a 3-2-4-4 (in the category order stated above), with an overall rating of 4, which landed me with my first choice of teachers, labs, and hopefully a badass ensemble.  AAAAHHHHHH!  So we're off to a good start.  Today, I bring stuff to my sis at Wheaton, drop off a financial aid form at Berklee, and move my stuff out of the Rock Harbor Estate.  *sniff*  I sure will miss that house.  Classes start next Mon, and I'm really excited.  Also have to move into my apartment and get a job soon.  Like tomorrow.  Hehe... this sure is fun.  Berklee is the grestest place on earth.

      I may never fully understand myself, which doesn't leave much hope for other people either.  I'd be sorry about that, but I'd have to want lots of people to understand me for me to do that, and I just don't.  I like it when they try, and take no real pleasure in their inevitable failure.  It's just reality, and I'm a realist.  But that's old news, and I'm here to say something relatively new.  I say relatively, because it's an old theme, new way of looking at it, maybe.  I dunno... maybe I just had a narcissistic need to post my thoughts online.  Whatever the reason, I'm posting.  I've been giving some thought to the girl who never goes away.  I'm never going to not think about her.  Ever.  8 years I've been thinking about her, and now we're really great friends, and she's not going anywhere. (well, aside from halfway around the world, but what's a few thousand miles between friends?)  I've recently been giving thought to the disturbing idea that we'll never be together... sure, for a while, I harbored delusions that she'd come back from her time away, older, wiser, ready to find 'the one' (these may all be true), and realize that 'the one' was right there all along--her faithful friend through thick and thin. (that part is utterly ridiculous) The boy who wrote her letters while she was away.  I fantasized that all that I was going to make of myself in the coming years was going to somehow be exactly what she wanted when the time came.  I also told myself that I really wasn't thinking any of this... I'm a fantastic liar, at least when dealing with myself.  So the thing is this, and I realized this when I was talking to a dear friend at school (I passed it off as though I had realized it some time ago and was just reiterating the point, but the fact is, I only realized it right then.), she and I can't be together because neither of us wants to marry/be with the kind of person the other is.  That... was poor English.  But stick with me here, because I don't think the thought itself was incoherent.  Our value systems work together really well.  Very important.  Lots of other stuff works, but she's really athletic and outdoorsy.  She's going to want a guy who's like her... uber-athletic, who wants to go camping and biking, and stuff like that.  I am very definitely not that guy (even though I spent this summer working out to get myself back into that kind of shape, and while I'd love to deny that she was the motivation, consider this my confession.)  I, on the other hand, am artsy, and I love doing artsy things.  Not absurd lame-ass artsy stuff... but I love music, and museums, and art, and history, and dance, and all that.  All of it.  That's what I want to surround myself with for the rest of my natural life.  I want to be with someone who not only feels the things I do, but feels them the WAY I do.  That is, if I want to be with anyone at all. (that's for another entry)  She would never write in a blog.  I don't know that she goes through complex emotional phases, or that she ever feels the need to sort them out in any sort of journal.  I assume these things at my own peril, of course.  I may be totally wrong, and then what kind of friend am I?  But whatever.  We're never going to be together.  She doesn't want my type, I don't want hers.  Unless it's her.  See why this never ends?  She's always the exception to every sweeping generalization designed to bring me comfort from the destruction she wreaks on my emotional state.  That's why, 8 years later, I'm still making stupid excuses as to why I don't care whether she'll ever love me.  I don't need validation from anyone else in my life, but I need it from her.  And that pisses me off, because I've spent the last 4 years building myself up from the worst self-esteem in the world, to where I finally don't really care about what anyone thinks of me, because I know that I am a good person, and a talented person, and a lovable person.  And there's this one person who throws a hammer through that whole idea, and I'd love to hate her for it, but I can't.  Maybe I'm not strong enough.    Or maybe this is just the great enigma of my life.  The one great tragedy.  He's come so far, but he can never be totally free of her, and how awful is that?  Poor boy.  But I am not a poor boy, and that's why this enrages me, and why I cannot lay the issue to rest.  It's like Steph's problem with Slick.  No one gets to her, and he did, and WHY?  But he'll never tell her what he said that made her react the way she did, and she can't remember, and that is tragic, because she's so strong.  Why is there always that one person who won't let you be as perfect as you want to be?  All I want is to be a goddamn brick wall.  No flaws, no gaps.  One door that I open when and only when I feel like it.    She called me on my birthday, you know that?  From halfway across the world, because she "didn't want her birthday wish to me to come through IM."  That's a great friend.  And that's why I refuse to take the one step that could put me on the road to forgetting her forever.  I love to hear her voice, and I love to know she's smiling, and I love to love her in whatever capacity I can, because when God puts someone that wonderful in your life, you'd better be grateful.  And I am grateful.  Thank you, God, and thank you, you.  Because without your friendship and your smile and your laugh and your voice, and "Bedtime Magic" with David Allan Boucher, and "In Too Deep", and "Name that Composer", and "Right Now", and power ballads in the Wendy's parking lot at 1am, and your soft french fries and my hard ones, and losing arm wrestling matches to you, my life is so much less colorful and vibrant.  And that's why I'm always going to love you with every cell in my body.  I hope that's okay.  I miss you.     "the moon's a fingernail, and slowly sinking, another day begins, and now I'm thinking that this indifference was my invention when everything I did sought your attention. you were my compass star, you were my measure, you were a pirate's map of buried treasure. if this was all correct, the last thing I'd expect,  the prosecution rests, it's time that I confess:  I must have loved you." -Sting, "Ghost Story"

We'll get lost on this dance floor, spinning around and around and around and around. They're all watching us now, they think we're falling in love-- they'd never believe we're just friends. When you kiss me like this, I think you mean it like that. If you do, baby, kiss me again."  Yeah, Toby.  Yeah.

      Lyrics for you again today.  This song is by a guy named Ben McKay who graduated from Berklee recently.  Country singer (of course)... this song was written as an assignment for his lyric writing class. (Write a song using the lyrics "Ashes, ashes, all fall down" from the nursery rhyme.) Wrote it outside the classroom right before class, ended up winning the John Lennon songwriting competition for it.  Great, great song.  "All Fall Down" - Ben McKay  So hot, early August-- first grade old news by now. Just a-runnin' and a-playin', next door neighbors, the best of friends-- We hide and seek til the day's end, singin'  "Ashes, ashes, all fall down," and we laugh and tumble to the ground, singin' "Ashes, ashes, all fall down,"  in the summer's warm embrace-- There's no better place than next to her as we all fall down.  So hot, early august-- senior year comin' up fast. As we stand in the doorway I see her eyes different than before-- Our hearts longin' for somethin' more, singin'  "Ashes, ashes, all fall down," and we laugh and tumble to the ground, singin' "Ashes, ashes, all fall down," in the summer's warm embrace-- There's no better place than next to her as we all fall down.  Fall in her arms, Fall through the years, Fallin' from laughter, Fall into tears. A husband and wife, joined together in joy-- a man and a woman,  a girl and a boy. Singin'   "Ashes, ashes, all fall down," and we laugh and tumble to the ground, singin' "Ashes, ashes, all fall down," in the summer's warm embrace-- There's no better place than next to her as we all fall down.  ----  If you wanna hear it, check out www.benmckay.com, and download it for yourself.

      I wrote my first country song last night/today.  The title is the title of this post.  I've hardly been able to not tell people, so a bunch of you already know.  It was a really exciting thing, though.  It got a little scary when I got to class and people started looking over the score... something about classmates reading intensely personal lyrics unnerves me.  But it was okay.  They were impressed, and I am pleased, especially upon going back over the song a few hours after turning it in.  It really is the lyric part that's so hard.  Maybe that's why I feel more comfortable with the idea of jazz composition... the idea that I can spend all my time writing for a couple of horns or a big band or something.  Maybe there are words, maybe there aren't... only I know.  The vulnerable feeling isn't there, though.  Says the boy who posts his inner conflicts to an online journal. *sigh*

      I was 0 for 3 today on football games.  I hate the Packers.  Packers win.  I HATE Peyton Manning.  Colts win.  Love Oklahoma.  LOVE.  LSU wins.  Mother%$%#^@!!!!  Anyway, I'm updating because, as Allison very astutely observed (and I agreed, before I knew what she was getting at), December 10th was a long time ago.  Surely stuff has happened since then, right?  Right.  I got a chance to go hang out with Jess's family for a little while a couple days after Christmas.  Talked to her mom and dad for a while, met their new dog, got bitten by the new dog... Do I need any more signs?  heh...  But it was really nice to see them and talk to them.  I haven't done either in so long.  Am still making Christmas present for the girl who never goes away.  I figure I've already missed Christmas and New Years (thanks, finals.  thanks, Mary and your stupid project), so why rush now?  I'm also redecorating my room at my apt... painting, adding new furniture and decorations and all that good stuff.  I reorganized all the furniture in my room on New Year's Eve, which was the beginning of the redecorating.  New year, new point of view.  The moving of the furniture made for a really funny New Year's morning experience when my roommate Steph rolled into my room wasted to wish me a happy new year.  She opened the door and started walking toward where my bed used to be and fell on top of me, lying in my bed where it is now.  I woke up, startled and a little drunk still, wondering who this girl with the purple wig who just jumped in bed with me was.  Confusion proceeded when said girl kissed me and wished me happy new year.  Ah.  It's you, Steph.  Happy new year. :)  Nice, though, being awakened by hot roomie falling in your bed and kissing you.  Difficult to complain.  The last couple days have been really low key, as days in New Hampshire inevitably are.  Got a call from Yvette today who asked me to help her work on a jazz piece because she's going to be SINGING WITH LES FUCKING PAUL SOON.  Singing with friggin' Les Paul.  Jeez, I sure wish I had something like that to worry about.  She also let me know that she's sending in her Berklee app tomorrow.  How exciting.  She belongs here.  She's not meant to be a music teacher.  She's meant to be a music doer.  It's in her veins... UMass Lowell just ain't cutting it.  Welcome to heaven, Yvette.  I'm very near giddy about returning to school in a couple weeks.  Only thing I'm nervous about is getting charts done for the Berklee Method.  Set's gonna be ridiculous, but I've gotta get the damn thing on paper, or it's not gonna be much of anything.  Katie Bank is my hero, and the best acamanager on the planet.  Sister jut hooked me up with a workshop at Cornell, a series of workshops at Harvard, an arrangement at Harvard, and a possible CD production gig at Bowdoin.  Holy phatness.  Katie, you're the shit.  I also got a call from Katrina today.  Katrina is the only person on the planet who I'll admit comes really close to understanding me.  It's amazing... and a little comforting.  Which is why I wish she hadn't moved to LA, because I miss her a lot.  (If she reads this, she'll tell me I'm being an idiot because we've never been in the same place anyway)  It's too bad she had people in the car, because I'd have liked to talk to her a lot longer... and without my mother in the same room as me, because I'm sure as hell not gonna talk about the girl who never goes away with my mother in my room.  The girl had my mother for freshman english in high school, after all.  It's also unfortunate that she let me talk the whole time, as I'd rather know what's going on with her and her new boy.  Why do you all need to know this?  Gah.  In 2004, I resolve to exercise discretion when writing in my blog.  Which implies that I'm resolving to write in my blog, too.  Enough from me.  More to come at a later date.  And believe me, there's plenty more.

      I'm sure this is getting boring for you all, but what the hell?  The girl who never goes away signed on right as her new song came on, so I thought I'd share it. :)  "I Can't Be Your Friend"  (Rushlow)  This might come as quite a shock, but I've given it a lot of thought. This thing that's come between us can't be ignored I've taken all I can, and this is where it's gotta end, cuz I can't be your friend anymore.  And I can't be accused of not being there for you How many nights have you shown up at my door? I hope you understand that this wasn't in my plans, but I can't be your friend anymore.  And it's killin' me to know you  without havin' a chance to hold you, and all I wanna do is show you how I feel inside. Now you can run to me,  you can laugh at me,  or you can walk right out that door. But I can't be your friend anymore.  So baby now it's up to you--do I win or do I lose? Will my heart fly or like broken on the floor? Well take me as I am,  cuz I wanna be your man, but I can't be your friend anymore.  And it's killin' me to know you  without havin' a chance to hold you, and all I wanna do is show you how I feel inside.

We can't be just friends anymore.  ------  Who are you, Mr. Songwriter, and how the shit did you get in my head?

      So here's what...  Lately, I've been really stressed and really confused and really disappointed in myself.  Stressed because I got sick and overextended and have been trying to play catch-up at school since spring break.  Confused because I finally decided that I wanted to like a girl and I ended up liking two.  And one exists in two levels of consciousness, I've found--one that's incredibly sweet and kind and interested in me, and one that's entirely focused on herself, material/superficial things, and uh... I dunno.  The other is a good friend who could probably be more, but I'm awful at reading signals, and probably doesn't want anything more than the really awesome friendship we already have.  Nice.  Disappointed because I've let stress and distraction win, and I've let my grades slip this semester.  Granted, I let them slip in two classes that were associated with a major I'm not going to do, but still, it's on the GPA, and it'll look an awful lot like I'm falling back into old habits.  First semester, I was unstoppable.  Second semester, supremely distractable.  Fuck.  Also, and consider this Confusion Part Deux, is I'm sorting through this haze of doubt as to whether I should be coming back to the Sound.  I know that what I have to offer, and my beliefs about the group, need to be present one more time to secure it in the consciousness of the new guys.  And man am I psyched about the new guys... I can't wait to sing with them.  BUT, I'm experiencing a bit of what Roo was telling me about: the resentment toward the little gigs we do--schools, community centers, sundry little gigs that take up precious time; as well as feeling entirely too old to be doing this one more time.  That sounds ridiculous, and I hope it is.  I'm 23, Samrat left when he was 27.  I've got time... but it's not just about numbers... I want to keep moving forward, and I keep fearing that this summer is just a distraction when I should be taking 20 credits at Berklee and getting my ass to Nashville as soon as humanly possible.  Maybe this will fade when finals end.  No more.  I have to go to a recording session.  I'll write more later.  Like September.

      Yeah, done spazzing, done caring what happens from here.  I want our friendship back to what it was.  If we never have anything more than that, so be it, but I will NOT lose a friend over this.  Two days ago, I got a random email through match.com.  Yeah, I'm on match.com.  I've had a profile up for 3 years, and was recently thinking about the futility that is finding someone on that site.  Figure, I get 3 emails a week with about 20 "matches" in them.  Plenty are repeats, but whatever.  So, 3 emails a week for 3 years, that's 3 x 156, which is 468, I think.  So 468 emails, with 16-20 people each, and over the course of those years and those emails, I've found fewer than a dozen, probably fewer than 8 people who I found interesting enough to even consider dropping $25 to email and open up a line of communication with.  I met one person, we went on a couple dates, wasn't quite right, we remain friends.  Met another person, immediately wasn't quite right, we're uh... occasional IM friends, but really have very little in common aside from a general hope that the other is alive, healthy, and happy.  Staggering odds, no?  So back to this email.  Girl who wrote it is gorgeous.  And articulate, and unique (oh my goodness... someone whose profile says more than "nice girl looking for the right one.  I like going out and having fun, but am equally happy curling up on the couch and staying in.")...  So I bite.  I drop the cash for the membership so I can respond to her email.  And she responds almost immediately.  And I respond again.  And she IMs me.  We talk for a couple hours, then both need to go to errands and be productive.  Get back from errands, talk for another 4 hours.  Good conversation, covered a lot of ground.  I'm not saying this is a match made in heaven, or that it ever will be anything, but my faith is renewed in my ability to find people who actually might consider wanting to be with me, ever.  And hell, that's a start.  And an important one after this weekend then the unpleasant surprise waiting when I called UMass.  I shouldn't be surprised.  It was an a cappella hookup.  Those things don't last.  Anyway, I retire to bed this evening a changed and slightly happier man.  God has been good to me in so many ways, and I'd have to be a pretty selfish, clueless SOB to think otherwise.    I have a hard time believing anyone reads this anymore anyway.  I've taken so long to update and all.  Am I wrong?  Go ahead, prove it.  Leave a comment. ;)

      I am SUCH an idiot.  So when you really like someone a lot, and you have an incredible friendship, and things seem like they're on a fast track to where you want them to be, the best step to proceed to is definitely:  a) Keep things the way they are, keep spending time together, and hope that you get some clear sign as to how to proceed; b) Make a move, hope it's received well; c) Get drunk and sleep together.  Again, I'm a complete idiot.  Conventional wisdom is completely lost on me, apparently.  Things were going SO well... I had even decided not to rush things, to believe that if they were going to happen, they were going to happen.  I'd actually reached a point where I felt it was inevitable, and so I was even MORE okay with holding off.  A date here, a date there... maybe soon we'd be dating legitimately, and wouldn't that be nice?  Then I got a phone call at 2:30am, which was innocent enough.  Then I made it something it wasn't, and though it was something I wanted to happen, that's not how I wanted it to happen.  We both deserve better, we deserve to have things happen under circumstances where we both know exactly what's happening and the consequences.  I'm afraid that she thinks I've lost some amount of respect for her, and I'm terrified that she's lost some for me.  I'm not safe anymore.  Fuck.  She's not to blame for this, and I'm not entirely to blame, either.  I'm not a bad person, and I think that if I'd not been drinking, I would have showed more respect for both of us, and stopped things at innocent making out.  I'm so scared right now that it's never going to be the same.  So, so scared.  V, could use your help right now.

      (click post title for link)  To all those who would use Michael Moore's pithy propaganda film as kindling for their own ill-conceived vitriol against President Bush (and even worse, try to rope their naive friends into similar ludicrasy), I highly recommend this article from a reliably uber-liberal website, by a man who writes for a handful of uber-liberal magazines (including The Nation and Vanity Fair).  Even reasonable people who have their own legitimate bones of contention with the current President can't tolerate Moore's baseless, irresponsible, and blatantly dishonest mockumentary, and indeed his entire method of operation.    Otherwise, la vita e bella.  There is a truly amazing woman in my life now who is, against all odds, everything I've ever wanted.  And the great thing is she's crazy about me, too.  I suppose the tables had to turn sometime.  Alright, enough.  I'll drop in again soon with a post that's entirely non-political.  This one just had to happen.
