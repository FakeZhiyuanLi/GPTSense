      Today I booked my flight to Manila. Okay, it's still a long time to wait as I'm going in November, but cannot help being excited. VERY excited! :-)

       Helsinki is a cutting-edge Scandinavian metropolis  As the capital of Finland, Helsinki is a melting pot of people of all nationalities, genders and sexual orientations. well-known for its tolerance, the town offers a wide range of attractions for gay tourists. The night-life is vivid and the amount of gay and lesbian clubs is astounding for a city of little more than half a million inhabitants. During the day you can enjoy the brilliant views of the Baltic sea and the city's breathtaking architecture. Not to mention that Helsinki is very safe and, thanks to the excellent public transportation, easy to get around.   In Finland, homosexuality is legal and widely accepted.  Since 2002, gay and leabian couples have been able to legally register their relationships. The age of consent for both gay and straight is 16.   Enjoy your stay!   source: Helsinki Gay Guide 2004    urlLink HELSINKI PRIDE 2004

        We walk in a fog that forever surrounds us  And hark to the sounds of the moonlight night,  We tread on a treacherous moss that confounds us,  And darkness of dusk human hearts does blight.   But two lonely hearts when join in singing  And calling each other in night's confine,  Two shadows entwining and lovingly clinging -  Oh wouldn't, oh wouldn't that be divine!    (Sung by a Finnish  urlLink Vocal Ensemble Rajaton  based on a poem by Eino Leino, music by Jussi Chydenius, translation by Jaakko Mäntyjärvi. The song can be found on Rajaton's album 'Boundless'.)

       (Please read  urlLink part 1  before continuing to read this one.)   The year was 1997, of which I spent 330 days in the military. During that time I had a steady girlfriend and we had moved in together in Helsinki. For me this was not a happy relationship as I was still fighting my feelings towards guys. I also had a small crush for my girlfriends brother, which  really  helped our sexlife. Not.  The fall of 1999 was a hard patch in my life:   1) I finally admitted to myself "You're GAY girl!" (imagine me snapping my fingers while saying that) 2) I broke up with my girlfriend and rented my own apartment 3) I started my first real job 4) I attended my grandmother's funeral    By December 1999 I had moved in my bachelor pad and had my first gay sex experience. Was I moving too fast? Just play George Michael's  Freedom ... You might get some idea of my state of mind back then. I was totally loving it! I was making up the lost time. Big time.  At this point I should probably let you in on the Finnish gay scene. A significant amount of it revolves around mobile phones, believe it or not. We have TV-chat shows where you can send text messages (SMS) to be displayed on the TV screen. Most of those are "clean", at least during the day, but come night time and it's all   "big masculine bear (30yo/190cm/100kg/22cm) looking for small submissive btm to blow me in my car. no older than 22. pls text to...".   How vulgar, eh? Then there's the internet. The dating services there. Chat rooms... These are the places where you'll find 80 per cent of the Finnish gay and bi population accompanied by the married men who get their kicks from fucking guys.  The gay bars and clubs are a fairly popular hang outs amongst the "openly gay" people. I'm a frequent customer myself. The people there are, unfortunately, the same year in year out. It's quite interesting to see the couples form and break up.  Long term relationship  seems to be a myth among the (male) gay population here. I am, however, blessed to know a few of these exceptional LTR-couples. I wish nothing but the best to you. You know who you are.  The Finnish society in all its glorious conservativeness seems to  still encourage us to hide our homosexuality and confine ourselves indoors, in front of computers and TV screens with our mobile phones in our hands. Okay, I have to admit that allowing same sex couples register their partnerships was a quantum leap in the right direction. Gosh... Now I feel sad for all those people who were protesting the act... Okay I'm better now.  Public display of affection. Hmmm... Now there's something you don't see around here. How often do you see a gay couple walking hand in hand in Helsinki? Hell, how often do you see a  straight  couple showing any kind of affection in the public? Compared to the other European countries, NEVER! It really breaks my heart. My husband and I  do  walk hand in hand around the city. Sure most of the people are looking at us like we're wearing clown outfits at a funeral and that's ok. I don't mind. We don't mind. One time a guy (part of a bigger group) shouted "fucking homos!" as we were walking past them. I was tempted to shout back " fucking bi-curious! ", but managed to keep it to myself. The fact that the guy had the "need" to shout just shows that he is insecure about his own sexuality and that he needs to make a huge scene about his  alleged straightness  to his friends. A good fucking would straighten him out! Well, you know what I mean. ;-)   to be continued... maybe...

      Finland is perceived as a liberal, progressive and sexually open country compared to many of it's neighbors in Europe. Okay, we  do  have next-to-equal rights for straight and same sex couples regarding marriage. Finland  was  the second country in the world (after New Zealand) to give women the right to vote. And yes, Nokia is a Finnish company.  When I talk to people from different parts of the world, there always seems to be a misconception about the degree of liberalism in the Finnish culture. Maybe it's the worlds perception of the  "free-spirited blonde haired and blue eyed Scandinavians"  in general. You know, the fact that we all run around naked... We've all seen those movies, where busty Swedish blondes frolic in the hay and engage in inconceivable sexual acts that a straight man might have wet dreams about. (I actually shudder when I read that sentence.)  I have to admit, that going to  sauna   naked  with family, friends or even prefect strangers is not something we (or at least I) would consider strange or unpleasant. Tourists find this  amusing  and some people I know are extremely timid and would not enter a sauna without a towel wrapped around their weists. Cultural differences... Hmmm...  It all starts in childhood, the way we are brought up. Some parents teach their kids to be bashful and will not let them run around the house naked in between diapers let alone outside in the summer.  Good God! How unhygienic is that?!  Then there's the other bunch of parents who have their kids sit butt naked on a public beach for every passing pedophile's amusement.  Living in a rural city for the first 11 years of my life I had the opportunity to do almost anything I wanted. Added the fact that as the youngest child my parents just didn't have the energy to fuck up their other child with over protecting. In the late 70's early 80's the concept of free upbringing, i.e. not setting strict boundries to your child, was the thing of the moment. This was great, though I was always getting myself into trouble.  I have to admit that most of my childhood memories have long since been erased. For example I cannot recall my friends in kindergarten, the name of my teacher in 1st grade or what I wrote in my letter to MacGyver - from whom I never heard back.  (Damn you Richard Dean Anderson! Damn you!)  I do remember the first time I started checking out other boys. This was in the 1st grade too in the showers after PE class. A bunch of us were messing around in the shower, showing our pathetic little weiners, playing them, pretending they were guitar strings.  After those wonderful prepubescent years the interest in guys never really went away. When I was a teenager I struggled with the idea of being gay. There were (to my knowledge) no gay men in our family or among my friends, so I didn't really have a gay role model around. All the pressure from friends, family and the still very conservative society pushed me into  "getting a girlfriend" . It was so exciting at first and I almost forgot about my curiosity towards my classmates. Couple of girlfriends later I was doing my military service. Being surrounded by over a hundred young, lean, testosterone oozing guys is really not that easy for a guy who's insecure about his sexuality. Way too much candy for the eye. And walking in on a couple in the middle of what looked like a real suck fest was probably the last straw that broke the camel's back...   to be continued...

      Okay, here goes... This is the  first  time I'm writing to my blog. I have to say I'm a bit excited. But I can't help thinking   "Do I really have something to write about? Is there a story to be told?" .  Despite my near-fatal-sceptisism about  actually  having something to write about, I will continue to write about my life - past, present and future - for those who seem to care (as well as a reminder to myself of what really happened).

      What is life without love and what is love without life.  A simple phrase in itself but in itself a simple praise.  That love is all accepting in accepting that love is all.   One looks for a true heart and from a true heart one looks.  Emotions only play a role dont play a role emotions only.  Thoughts need guidance as guidance needs thought.   Is love what we share or what we share is love.  We share what love is and love is what we share.  Lets make love very simple&nbsp;so very simply lets make love.      A poem by Andrew James Boon, 5th January 2000      &nbsp;   "Thank you, Andrew, for allowing me to post this poem."

       Okay... It's been over a month since my last update. My deepest apologies to all of you who have been egarly waiting for more news on this crazy thing we call life.    &nbsp;  My three-week vacation has come to an end and the reality of&nbsp;going back to work&nbsp;hits me on the head with a shovel. I really don't feel like dragging my ass to the office tomorrow morning, sitting by my desk, browsing through the 500 or more emails that I've received during the past three weeks, updating my calendar(s) with meetings with Graphic Designers, Art Directors, Project Managers, print houses, advertising agencies etc., starting to organize a seminar for 250 people with invitations, catering, music, security and speakers to attend to, writing texts for our new website which should be opened on 1 Sept. etc. etc. etc. *sigh* Less than 4 months to go until my vacation in the Philippines... Less than 4 months to go...    &nbsp;  I haven't really done anything productive during my vacation. Well, the first week was a hassle because I still had to finish some work with web designers and our ad agency. The last 2 weeks have been basically time for myself, re-charging the batteries so to speak. I'll post some photos from my vacation and let you in on some of the events.    &nbsp;  Catch you later! Ciao!
