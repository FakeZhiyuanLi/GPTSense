      	Sanctity hangs upside down from the dock, with her hair fanning out above her and her eyes pointed upwards but sideways at the water and the trees and the sky.   	“You ever wonder how long this is going to last?” she says, paddling her arms in the water slowly.   	“What do you mean?” My name is Euphoria and there is a stick in my hand. This dock is attached to nothing, but we are attached to this dock. Forever and ever amen. I push the water away with my stick, getting us as far away from ‘there’ as possible.  	“I mean… this,” A leaf floats by her head and she almost misses it, but goes out of her way to grab it from the easy current. “This.” She says, turning the leaf over and over so that the sunlight catches it and casts a shadow on our wooden sanctuary. It reminds me of autumn. The leaf, I mean.  	“Well, when winter comes around, that leaf will crumble and die. That’s the cycle of life, I suppose. At least, that’s what they told me.”  	“Who is ‘they’?” She cocks her head to the side and bites her bottom lip. The freckle in her right eye is quite apparent against midnight blue and springtime sky. At least, that’s what I’ve always said.  	“You know…’they’. The School, The Church, The World, ‘they’.” Another sturdy sticks floats by and I pick it up with my free hand. Shaking the water from it, I lay it in front of her on the dock’s surface. “Help me,” I say.  	“Oh,” She takes the stick in her hand and manipulates the currents with me. “Okay.”   	By now, we must be miles away from our origin. The overbearing presence of her father, my overwhelming lack thereof, the bottles and the taffeta and the roses that they liked to think we loved. There, she was Annie, and I was Louise. Annie Sophia and Louise Marie. And we lived together under the crescent moons that turned our mothers into whores and our fathers into cowards.   We ran away from the boys who grabbed at our chests and dug their fingernails into our necks when we tried to pull away from their venomous lips, and we went to The Cornfields. Sometimes we’d snap the stalks in half and pull them over us to keep us warm. As long as there were Annie Sophia and Louise Marie, there was always something to keep us warm.  	But now, we are Sanctity and Euphoria. The children told stories about us sometimes, and they called me Saint Patience. She was The Angel with the pretty mouth. The Angel and Saint Patience, forever and ever amen.

      Meet Jezebel.        After I made last night's post, my dad picked me up and we went to the Music and Arts Center. I played some of the others (including a Flying V, which felt more like a piece of ... equipment ... rather than a guitar), but I fell in love with this one. She is an Ibanez AM-70, and I love her.  That's not to say that I will be neglecting Emily, though.  The only reason I am making this post is because I am excited. I'm excited that The Glory and The Fire now has seven members instead of six. Now, we are made up of Chy, Ginger, Kimber, Alexis, Emily, Jezebel, and I.  Yeah, it's probably a little corny. But I love them all so much...

      There's really not much to say lately. Not even in  urlLink livejournal  have I posted anything relevant to real life. It's always either too personal or not personal enough. That, and I really don't think that anyone cares. But, after reading  urlLink Michael's  blog, I decided to post here. Let's see how this goes.  What's really been going on with me, you ask? School. School, school, and more school. The funny thing is, there's only been four days of it, so far. On Monday we did grammar. On Tuesday we did grammar. On Wednesday we took a grammar test and then started in the literature books. And yesterday we listened to the radio all day and read  Marigolds  and  Plainswoman . Poetry paraphrasing and creative writing. It's really not that bad. I don't hate it. It's just not Ritchick, though.  Yesterday I went to Columbia with Paul, Jessica, and Matt to see  urlLink Dashboard Confessional ,  The Get Up Kids ,  Thrice , and  urlLink Head Automatica  play at the Merriweather Pavillion.   It was an awesome show and I really don't have much to say about it, other than Thrice rocked my face off and Dashboard played for an hour and a half. I went in hating Chris Carraba, and I came out loving him. He really is a cocky bastard, but a really nice guy. He has an amazing presence and really knows how to work the crowd.   Also, the fact that he sang "I Will Play My Game Beneath The Spin Light" in the middle of "Remember To Breathe" was amazing and I will admit that, yes, I cried a little.  I got home with threatening notes all over the place and I've been a wreck ever since. Breathing is such a chore, anymore.  I'm supposed to be getting some pills later, and then going to look at guitars. That is, if everything goes as planned. Which it won't.   I miss him.
