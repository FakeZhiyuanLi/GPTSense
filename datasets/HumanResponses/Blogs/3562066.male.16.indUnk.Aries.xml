      Hey, all, all three people who will be reading this as it is. I'm Toaster_Rancher, and this is my life. Right now I'm in the midst of studying for a bunch of finals that I will be taking in two days, and preparing for Speech and Debate nationals. As of now I am top 48 in the nation, I think I can improve on that. But whatever, Utah is going to be crazy fun, and I'll see what happens. Reagan died yesterday, its sad, but it was his time to go, don't particularly agree with his fiscal policy, but the detente that man restarted with the Soviets probally saved our respective asses more than we could imagine.

      Ugh! What an immense waste of time. I knew I was a shoe in for Peer Ministry at my school, but unfortunately for me, good old head of the SFC and Peer Ministry program decided to do a points system. Of course the problem that lies within this system is that the kids with the best grades, always get in. I do not have the best grades, but I am a good student. I also have a great deal of leadership experience, which many of the kids who were elected to Peer Ministry, by this nutty points system, do not! This whole week has just been terrible for a litany of reasons. Well actually more like the past five days but still. Life just seems to suck, well, the life out of me right now. It's really quite disheartening. Well, to those Peer Ministers who deserved to be where they are (and you know who you are), good luck in your endeavors. To those who don't shape up, because you have taken on a serious amount of responsibility.

      Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I have two days to study for a French Final, this is nuts. Honestly I think I can pass it as is, but I'm going in with a real strong GPA. I don't want to blow it on a big fat sixty five. I'll see how it goes, but its going to be a struggle. Although, my teacher is a real moron, and I think he is reviewing specifically with questions from the final. If he is, I'll be in luck. If not, I'm screwed. Anyhow, beyond that, I have a disfunctional counselor, who is so old he can't get anything done. Honestly I feel pretty disadvantaged at this school. But there really isn't anything I can do about it. Deciding to nerd out as of late and blowing a fat five hundred on a Warhammer 40K army. I've gotten away from my nerdy roots in years past but sometimes those old urges still spring up.

      Only now has the enormity of the task that I have in front of me truly dawned upon me. THIS IS CRAZY. I have two days left to study for four finals, I am going to go nuts. But I guess thats how life is, Nuts. Well I have to go figure out how the hell to do a redox problem and relearn my entire Chemistry Curriculum in one day. Wish me luck folks.

      Well, I have my French and Religion finals at 9:00AM and 11:00AM respectively. I haven't studied at all for Religion, but if you've read my other posts, i've obviously done some serious work for French. We'll see, plus its going to be a bit weird to have my forensics coach proctor my final, but I guess it doesn't matter. I am really looking forward to getting to nationals and seeing this year through. Speaking of, this whole thing is going to be one massive party, even though its in Utah. Hoping that something will happen there, i'm looking for semi-finals, and if i'm really lucky finals. Ten four hour prelim rounds over five days is going to be tough, and so will the eight remaining hours of semis/finals. Besides winning something worthwhile I need to have some fun there, its supposed to be one big party, I don't see how considering how tired we will be. But maybe I can get some action, if not I am just going to be pissed. But thats how life goes I guess.

      Sorry I haven't updated in a bit folks, well in any case here goes. I finished four finals in two days and besides my French (failed it). I know I did very well in English, Religion, and possibly Chemistry. Beyond that on Saturday I woke up at 5 AM and went to my school, where we cut it within like 10 minutes of our final boarding call by the time we got on the plane, cause we gave ourselves two hours (including driving) of time before it. That was nerve wracking. The four hour flight had some of the smallest seats I have ever sat in. I was next to this really fat person too, so that was just annoying as hell. Agh, it was so bad for me. The second flight was great, I had plenty of room, because I was up against the bulkhead, so I could sleep. The only annoying part was that the FBI agent sitting next to me, decided to get talketive. Talk about a "nod and smile" situation. Well, the weekend has been decent so far. The desolation of Salt Lake City, the non exsistant sites. But a really great, mall, thats ridiculous. Of course, there was a big outdoors store, that completely violates my views on camping. I do not take a house with me, apparently some people think camping means bringing everything,   including the kitchen sink  . But now, I'm in my hotel room doing research, and writing a big ass blog. Congress I feel, is the only catagory that caries beyond the room, in a social and a sense of true office work, its not a badge of honor, but I think it tells you something about the kind of people who do it. Thats it for now if I rank at all i'll tell ya.

      Great day today. Well first off, lets deal with nationals. I came into semi-finals, which makes me top 60 speakers in the nation. Fairly solid, but I can do better. Well I have two years. In addition I just found out that, I will be doing a college interview at Whitman in the Northwest. Well I suppose that I need to start getting used to these things. I guess its a bit new. Also meeting with a debate coach there. Hopefully Student Congress is on thier radar. Ok moving on from that great day today. Hooked up with this girl for like an hour saw brests for the first time, It was great. Of course bumbling idiot would describe my experiance. But it'll get better. Oh and finally, finals are over which is great. I'm sure by now that I bombed french but i've stopped worrying. Thats it folks, Peace!
