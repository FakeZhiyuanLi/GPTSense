          I need models for photoshoots!      The only requirement I have is that you must be 16 or older!    Most of you guys are, so this shouldn't be a problem.  I'm looking to do some beach shots, some studio ones we can set up with white sheets and some good lighting, as well as posed glamour shots in different situations.   Girls that I have asked already are Bean and Mia, so I need a few more, possibly one with  dark hair , one with blonde.  I definitely need guys . Looking for  skinny and/or built guys  that are  attractive  for posed shots and glamour shots. I know this seems superficial, but I want to try this area of photography.

      I definitely have been bugged online by some people lately. Some of these people I know, some are random middle schoolers from Arkansas or wherever. I made a never Screen Name for my special & closest friends, which I told them not to give to anyone. My screen names are linked so I will get those occasional annoying IMs, but now its easy to just turn them off.

      Here are some pictures for your viewing pleasure.  I wish I could have captured the smell of the nail place. God, I thought I was going to get high.  Here is Mia, getting her nails done.  urlLink Click for Mia    After I told Mia to ask how much a French manicure is over a regular one, she got one. They look so much nicer than acrylic nails do on most people.    Process:   The highlights in the hair were intensified, and I made use of the channel mixer to bring out her skin and get rid of the fluorescent light glow it reflected. I also toned down the light a big and corrected the color on the ladies shirt.    Edit:   There wasn't much color on her hand due to the light, so i am going to start over from the original tomorrow and fix the image.    Beth however, looked great in acyrlics.  urlLink Click for Beth   They are both smiling because the lady was laughing at me taking pictures.   Mia made me!    Process    I left the nails in color to make them stand out. I used quick mask to isolate the nails, then used channel mixer on the rest of the picture in monotone. Then I fine tuned using the desaturating sponge tool and quick mask to desaturate around the nails.. I booted saturation, contrast and brightness around the nails to show them off a bit more, and got rid of the lights reflection on the white part, which made them look yellowish. Took me 15-30 minutes. General unsharp mask applied as always to make the subject pop out a bit more. I'll add my borders/logo in a few.    Later I'm going to make a crop of Mia and turn it into a b&w glamour shot.  I think these would look good as 8x10s, so if anyone wants a copy tell me! I have the high resolution copies.

      Mia, Beth and I went to the beach yesterday! Holla! Haha shirtless college boys running around... Mmmmm. Megan Bowman was supposed to come, but she didn't have time before work so she went tanning instead. Mark was supposed to come, but he got seen by his tennis coach and couldn't.   To all my juniors and seniors at Prom, Have the best time of your lives!   To all my friends going to an afterprom party... Party like is yo' Birthday!     You know I party like an animal guys >;), but please remember to get a DD! You could hurt yourself or other... Or get your license taken away like half the other kids I know.       Be safe         I

      These past 36 hours have been some of the worst of my life. After a mediocre day at school, it was followed by some gossip spreading by a certain unnamed junior. What she said I didn't say, and I'm sorry for the trouble it caused. I cried for over an hour about that and another issue that came up within five minutes of this happening. Luckily for me, not all hope was lost when my trusty friends such as Mojo, Kate & Virginia. I couldn't have pulled through without you guys. I didn't feel like sleeping, so I stayed up till 5:30 then basically passed out for an hour. At school I immediately ran to Megan who calmed me down and talked to me, so the day improved. I'll post about the beach in a few

      You know that Avon door-to-door selling program for teens called Meet Mark. It ends with 'Have you met Mark?' Well the other day, I did met my 'Mark' and DAMN, is he Fineeee! Damn Sexy Beast. I haven't really talked to him, to shy, but tomorrow i'm just gonna act like I've known him all my life and get the fuck over it. Mia and I looked at clothes with Nicole. I love Ralph Lauren, they have some really sexy shirts, for guys and girls. Mia and I are applying everywhere, so we won't be broke for much longer. I want to go clothes shopping next weekend with Bean & Mia, and want to invite Megan, Sarah and of course, 'Mark'. (Provided he likes shopping!) AP exam in a few weeks, dreading it, gonna flunk it, who the fuck cares!?

        You have an entrancing kiss~ the kind that leaves your partner bedazzled and maybe even feeling he/she is dreaming.

      I couldn't sleep... Again. I fell asleep at 2 Sunday night, but I went to bed at like 11... WTF!?!? My mom tells me its because I sleep in late on weekends, catching up all the sleep I've missed. BS. Didn't sleep last night either. Took some homeopathic shit the rents bought it didn't work, I actually felt more awake. I think I basically passed out around one something, but woke up at 2:30 and then again around 4...My doctor probably wont put me on anything next time I see him either, and the rents wont buy Nytol or nyquil of anything... I'm so grumpy at school, sorry... If I'm bitching at you its just because less than four hours of sleep two nights in a row makes me pissed as hell.

      So yeah, I have this friend, I've known her for a couple years, and we shared some good times. Lately I'm really worried because she got caught up in the whole drug shit. Not pot either. Narcotics. She got busted at school because some people told a guidance counselor that they wanted her to get caught because she had a problem. So, in rehap after trying to commit suicide, she got more drugs from all the burnouts there, namely ritalin, she dropped out of school and she cut herself and its infected like woah. WTF does she have to do this. I   Rant over...

BTW I now have two dates because I'm such a pimp! Mia is my 2nd date! Holla! I am getting all beautified before ring dance with Bean and Mia I guess now LOL. Beans mom rockas.

         Party Hard         The plan:   I bought my clothes, they are sexy man. Hopefully Bean and I are gonna make ourselves super pretty for the dance. This means exfoliating mask, facials, the works. I have to check with her on this, but I think that's the general idea. Mia is gonna come along afterwards and party, hopefully along with Beth and mark, Mia is gonna ask if we can party at his place. We might invite a few more people for a chill party on the beach and watch the sunset. The plans could change at any time, but I really want to be on the water and watch the sunset so I hope it works out. Definitely need to find someone special to share that moment with, hopefully a guy, but I have always got Mia! :D

      Beans Away Message: rubbing my hands all over its smooth surface, caressing it, gently stroking at first, then going harder and faster. I take my shirt off because it is so hot. Now I'm on top, going harder, I want to touch every inch. I'm out of breath, my hair is disheveled, but yet I keep going. And then I wax my car after washing it. Get your mind out of the gutter.  Good thing she told me she was gonna wash the car before hand, or I woulda had some really dirty thoughts...  Speaking of dirty, this guy who got my sn from someone else keeps hitting on me, and I know he's not my type. Bean, I think I'm gonna need your help getting this bugger away... :(

      So Chrissy and I decided that we were going to make a video documentary of this summer, starting with me  speaking at graduation (if I do) and then progressing to me getting wasted that night. Then right before we all leave for college we're going to watch it. I think the final product will be a  mixture of a comedy and porn with a plot. 18 fucking days left.

Since grandma found out i can't sleep she has tips for keeping my energy up and sleeping, which include lettuce sandwiches and coffee. News flash. Nyquill knocks me out, coffee keeps me up...  I'm setting up an image gallery. Yeah, its gonna be badass once i get eveything done. Once they update everything will run much better as well.

      So, yeah this week sucked... I can't stand people, there's only about 10 people I can stand to talk to. Bean, our mutual friends and a few others. Oh, I forgot her Mom, who I am going to have an in depth convo with later...  MY MOMS an ass, and I told her that this morning. She's totally unsympathetic to my life in general, as well as life this week. I will be acting very British this week while the grandparents are in town, and my mom expects me to act like her perfect lil' bitch. NOT HAPPENING DUMBASS! I had lied to her  so I can get out of grounding for tonight. Lindsey is teaching me cosecants and shit for trig. FUUNNNN! I also have to apply at Aromas! FUN! I hope I work there, it would rock. This is true, the other half isn't.  Bean is tired, me fucking 2! Ledger Sucks, Life sucks, and I just feel like dying. I need a cigarette... How many humps does a camel have on the camel pack?

      So there I was at Ledger, editing some pictures. Megan is behind me and starts to read the back of my shirt, which says "It's not how big you are, it's how big you THINK you are" and kyle thought megan was just randomly saying it, and he got all excited and was like "Really!?" Hmmmmm...maybe someone should compensate his small penis for a jeep with very large tires, or a hummer with a lift.

      So I didn't go to school today, I was out till 6:45 then my mom woke me up and I remember my dad yelling Ricky in the most annoying and obnoxious voice ever when I'm trying to sleep 5 more minutes so I wouldn't pass out in math gain. Ass. Hearing is voice before 12:00 makes me want to cry... My mom said I had 5 minutes to get ready and she wouldn't take me if I wasn't up and id have to stay home. Again, another Ass living in the house. Hmm, so being gay, of course I couldn't get fucking ready in 5 minutes so I stayed home. I was out again 10 minutes later and woke up around 2.   I don't know why I'm so tired.  Bean, did you give me Mono when you took the Tic-Tac off my tongue!?! You already gave someone an ear infection and me a sinus infection!

      Ricky is in the shower right now, I'm at his house and bored out of my mind, and it's not like I can smoke a cigarette with his mom. He's getting prettied up because he smells like shit and I refuse to go out in public with a bad smelling fag. Now he just walked downstairs in a towel. I should rip it off of himm but I might have to go to six weeks of therapy. Either that or rehab...AGAIN. Naked ricky just doesn't appeal to me. Today my sister called and bitched me out because she said I stole her tampons. I told her to take a roll of paper towels with a rope attached and use that instead; she's loose enough. ;) For some reason this made her angry and gave her the urge to incessantly call me, propting me to not answer my cell phone. Stupid, stupid girl. She wonders ehy I cut up her american eagle jeans; maybe because the bitch does things such as dumping my $70 bottle of whiskey down the drain. The $70 UNOPENED bottle of whiskey. Stupid, sstupid girl. Don't girls know not to be bitches to Beans?

Oh yeah, you arn;t that afraid of her... Hmmm, how about Kizza Kate? Yeah, you'd piss yourself if I did. How about I haul my own fat ass over to personally put you in your place? I swear if I have to deal with you till 9 o'clock at night this week, don;t get on my nerves. Remember what I did to Kelly? Yeah, Imagine that 20 times worse. I'll shove my camera so far up your ass you can't breathe lil bitch. Have a nice day :)  On the other hand, Ledger is cancelled tomorrow or at least till 7.

          Hmmm... Some people are so fucking naive and immature. I wish (insert name here) would grow up and stop encouraging stupid high school bull shit. This is the reason I have never dated anyone younger than me, and I intend to keep it that way.      On to a more positive note...I get out of school in 11 fucking days. Hmmmmm...now just what can I do to shock everyone at graduation? Any suggestions?       Note: I thought I was in love when I was 15 and 16, but I was actually getting emotionally abused. Now that's love. I have still never been in love and look at how many relationships I have been in since then. Point expressed.

      Saturday rocked, I had a lot of fun hanging out with friends like Bean. But Damn, as soon as it reached Sunday ( I fucking mean 12:00:01) the day took a bad turn. Around 12:20, Bean pulls up with Beth, who BTW called twice when no one picked up after 20 rings, which woke momma cat up. She was pissed because she had told Beth not to expect Lindsey to be her Taxi. (I   Bean, You remember what you and I talked about in the car, so please do that, even though you may not want to because of your feelings or whatever, but it's for the best.     P.S. I'm sorry for asking you for a ride at like 12 something, i'll call you later.

      This was one of the funniest things I've ever read. Mojo and Kate got to meet him and pretended to be his groupies, so i decided to post a link his speech. This is my favorite part:  And the other thing….that I will say is, when I spoke earlier about the world being broke, I was somewhat being facetious, because every generation has their challenge. And things change rapidly, and life gets better in an instant.   I was in New York on 9-11 when the towers came down. I lived 14 blocks from the twin towers. And when they came down, I thought that the world had ended. And I remember walking around in a daze for weeks. And Mayor Giuliani had said to the city, “You’ve got to get back to normal. We’ve got to show that things can change and get back to what they were.”   And one day I was coming out of my building, and on my stoop, was a man who was crouched over, and he appeared to be in deep thought. And as I got closer to him I realized, he was playing with himself. And that’s when I thought, “You know what, we’re gonna be OK.”    LOL! That was great!

If you need the server info for ws ftp it should be saved on yoru comp and be default once you open ws_ftp, if not, im me or emai me for it bean.

NO USABLE PICTURES EITHER...  I need my clothes back bean... Stop dressing like a gay guy!  Filed trip tomorrow = loads of pictures of my friends from 3rd block on the bus and in Richmond.

My moms a bitch and so are other moms, I wont go into detail, so I hate moms too.  I want to go dancing in the rain...

Let's just hope she doesn't go out on a whim and ram the navigator into the side of the statue of liberty or something of the like. I need to work on my graduation speech; I at least need to think of a title by tomorrow. How does "Aiming Higher Every Day" sound? or "Having the Absolut Best Time in High School" Or how about "Putting a Little Perc Into Every Day" Hmmmmm....any suggestions?

       My cologne should not have to be used to cover up the foul scent of old. I think theres even a glade plugin running in the bathroom. Time to replace it... My bathroom SHOULD NOT SMELL LIKE OLD! There are towels everywhere, like over the shower railing, on all the racks, door handles. PLUS, the decide my sink is the best one to use. All my shot constantly gets moved around by my brother an my mom when she decides to 'clean' and now i have 2 other people doing it! Dinner last night sucked, we have a new table and i couldnt fit without hitting my legs on my grandma and my elbows on my mom and dad. This meant that I had to wait for my dinenr or have my mom bitch about im too big. If this was my friends i wouldnt care because they ar nice, but my family seems so artificial and im barely even talkign to my grandparents because i just dont like this many people in the house. I havent seen them in over a year, and barely talked to them, and now my whole world is raining down because of  them...   &nbsp;   Bean, the ledger sleepover is a go for monday i think... My dad was liek no, yoru coming home and i was like i dont have a choice.. Yeah. Im saying like to much. Mom didnt say much, but i told her how late we could be so im just going.    &nbsp;   Burnt you a cd&nbsp;called LEDGER DANCE PARTY!   --- Cheers, Ricky  	  Edit: So when i post by email, i have to get rid of yahoo ads still.

      HAHA! I loved his speech so I decided to post the transcript! be sure to watch the video after the speech to see will use a beer bong.  My favorite part is the Bush Speech, especially the part about WMD.  Warning long ass Post!     352nd Harvard Commencement Thursday, June 5, 2003  Class Day speech June 4, 2003 Will Ferrell This is not the Worcester, Mass Boat Show, is it? I am sorry. I have made a terrible mistake. Ever since I left "Saturday Night Live," I mostly do public speaking now. And I must have made an error in the little Palm Pilot. Boy. Don't worry. I got it on me. I got the speech on me. Let's see. Ah, yes. Here we go.  You know, when Bill Gates first called me to speak to you today, I was honored. But when he wanted me to be one of the Roxbury guys, I -- Sorry, that's Microsoft. I'm sorry about that. Star Trek Convention. No. NRA. NAACP. Dow Chemical. No. But that is a good one. That is a good speech. The University of Michigan Law. Johns Hopkins Medical School. I'm sorry. Are you sure this is not the boat show? No, I have it. I do have it on me. I do. It's here. Thank you.  Ladies and Gentlemen, Distinguished Faculty, Administrators, Friends and Family and, of course, the graduating Class of 2003, I wish to say hello and thank you for bestowing this honor upon me as your Class Day speaker. After months of secret negotiations, several hundred secret ballots, and a weekend retreat with Vice President Dick Cheney in his secret mountain bunker, a Class Day speaker was chosen, and it was me. You obviously have made a grave error. But it's too late now. So let's just go with it.  Today's speech is going to be a little different, a little unorthodox. Some of you may find it to be shocking. I'm not going to stand up here and try to be funny. Because even though I am a professional comedian of the highest caliber, I've decided to do one thing that a lot of people are probably afraid to do, and that's give it to you straight.  As most of you are probably aware, I didn't graduate from Harvard. In fact, I never even got a call back from Admissions. Damn you, Harvard! Damn you! I told myself I would not get emotional today. But damn it, I'm here, and sometimes it's just good to cry.  I'm not one of you. Okay? I can't relate to who you are and what you've been through. I graduated from the University of Life. All right? I received a degree from the School of Hard Knocks. And our colors were black and blue, baby. I had office hours with the Dean of Bloody Noses. All right? I borrowed my class notes from Professor Knuckle Sandwich and his Teaching Assistant, Ms. Fat Lip Thon Nyun. That's the kind of school I went to for real, okay? So my gift to you, Class of 2003, is to tell you about the real world through my eyes, through my experiences. And I'm sorry, but I refuse to sugarcoat it. I ain't gonna do it. And I probably shouldn't use the word "ain't" during this day in which we celebrate education. But that's just the way I play it, Homes.  Graduates, if you will indulge me for a moment, let me paint a picture of what it's like out there. The last four or, for some of you, five years you've been living in a fantasyland, running around, talking about Hemingway, or Clancy, or, I don't know, I mean whatever you read here at Harvard. The Novelization of the Matrix, I don't know. I don't know what you do here.  But I do know this. You're about to enter into a world filled with hypocrisy and doublespeak, a world in which your limo to the airport is often a half-hour late. In addition to not even being a limo at all; often times it's a Lincoln Towncar. You're about to enter a orld where you ask your new assistant, Jamie, to bring you a tall, non-fat latte. And he comes back with a short soy cappuccino. Guess what, Jamie? You're fired. Not too hard to get right, my friend.  A world where your acting coach, Bob Leslie-Duncan -- yes, the Bob Leslie-Duncan -- tells you time and time again that you will never, ever be considered as a dramatic actor because you don't play things real, and are too over the top. Amazing! Simply amazing!  I'm sorry, graduates. But this is a world where you aren't allowed to use your cell phone in airplanes, during live theater, at the movies, at funerals, or even during your own elective surgery. Apparently, the Berlin Wall went back up because we now live in Russia. I mean just try lighting up a cigar in a movie theater or paying for a dinner for 20 friends with an autograph. It ain't that easy. Strong words, I know. Tough talk. But more like tough love. Because this is where my faith in you guys comes into play, Harvard University's graduating Class of 2003, without a doubt, the finest, most talented group of sexual beings this great land has to offer.  Now I know I blew some of your minds with my depiction of what it's really like out there. But if anyone can handle the ups and downs of this crazy blue marble we call Planet Earth, it's you guys. As I stare out into this vast sea of shining faces, I see the best and brightest. Some of you will be captains of industry and business. Others of you will go on to great careers in medicine, law and public service. Four of you -- and I'm not at liberty to say which four -- will go on to magnificent careers in the porno industry. I'm not trying to be funny. That's just a statistical fact.  One of you, specifically John Lee, will spend most of your time just hanging out in your car eating nachos. You will all come back from time to time to this beautiful campus for reunions, and ask the question, "Does anyone ever know what happened to John Lee?" At that point, he will invariably pop out from the bushes and yell, "Nachos anyone?!" At first, it will scare the crap out of you. But then you'll share a laugh with your classmates and ultimately look forward to John jumping out of the bushes as a yearly event.  I'd like to change gears here, if I could. Talk a little bit about "Saturday Night Live." Now, during my 18-year stint on the show, I had the chance to play or impersonate some very interesting people, none more interesting than our current President, Mr. George W. Bush. Now in some cases, you actually have contact with some of the people you play. As a byproduct of this former situation, the President and myself have become quite good friends. In fact, I might even call him a father figure of sorts, granted a dim-witted father figure who likes to take a lot of naps and start wars, but a father figure nonetheless.  When I told the President that I'd be speaking here today, he wondered if I would express some sentiments to you. And I said I'd do my best. So, if you don't mind, I'd like to read this message from the President of the United States.  Students, Faculty, Families and Distinguished Guests, I just want to take time to congratulate you on your outstanding achievement as graduates of the Class of 2002. The great thing about being the Class of 2002 is that you can always remember what year you graduated because 2002 is a palindrome which, of course, is a word or number that is the same read backwards or forwards. I'll bet you're surprised I know that word, but I do. So you can suck on it.  Make no mistake, Harvard University is one of the finest in the land. And its graduates are that fine as well. You're young men and women whose exuberance exude a confident confidence of a bygone era. I believe it was Shakespeare who said it best when he said, "Look yonder into the darkness for knowledge onto which I say go onto that which thou possess into thy night for thee have come with only a single sword and vanquished thee into darkness."  I'm going to be honest with you, I just made that up. But I don't know how to delete it from the computer. Tomorrow's graduation day speaker is former President of Mexico Ernesto Zedillo. Ernie's a good man, a deeply religious man, and one of the original members of the Latino boy band Menudo. So listen up to Ernie. He was at the beginning of the whole boy band explosion.  As you set off into the world, don't be afraid to question your leaders. But don't ask too many questions at one time or that are too hard because your leaders get tired and/or cranky. All of you sitting here have the brightest of futures ahead. Many of you will go on to stellar careers and various pursuits. And four of you -- and I'm not at liberty to say which four -- will go on to star in the porno industry.  One of the challenges you will be faced with is finding a job in our depressed economy. In fact, the chances of landing a decent job are about as good as finding weapons of mass destruction in the Iraqi desert. Slim and none. And Slim just left the building. In fact, the closest thing I found to looking like a weapon of mass destruction is the turd that Dick Cheney left in the Oval Office toilet about an hour ago. Man, that thing is a WMD if I've ever seen one. On that note, God bless and happy graduation.  You know, I sincerely hope you enjoy this next chapter of your life because it's really going to be great, as long as you pay your taxes. And don't just take a year off because you think Uncle Sam is snoozing at the wheel because he will descend upon you like a hawk from hell. Let's just put it this way. After some past indiscretions with the IRS, my take-home pay last year was $9,000.  I figured I'd leave you today with a song, if you will. So, Jeff, if you could come up here. Jeff Heck, everyone. Please welcome one of your fellow graduates. Jeff is, of course, from Eliot House. You know what you guys? You guys at Eliot House, give yourselves a nice round of applause because you had the head lice scare this year, and it shut you down for most of last semester. But you didn't mind the tents they set up for you, and you were just troopers. You really were.  Anyway, here's a song that I think really captures the essence of the Harvard experience. It goes a little like this.  [SINGING] I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone, All my dreams, pass before my eyes, a curiosity. Dust in the wind, all they are is dust in the wind. Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea, All we do, crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see. Dust in the wind, all we are is dust in the wind.  Okay, you know what? I'm just realizing that this is a terrible graduation song. Once again, I'm sorry. This is the first time I've actually listened to the lyrics. Man, it's a downer. It's bleak.  Boy, I want to finish this. Just give me a minute, and let me figure out how to fix this thing. Okay. I think I got it.  [SINGING] Now don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the Harvard alumni endowment fund. It adds up, has performed at 22 percent growth over the last six years. Dust in the wind, you're so much more than dust in the wind. Dust in the wind, you're shiny little very smart pieces of dust in the wind.  Thank you. Good luck. And have a great day tomorrow.

      Hmmm... Since I am deemed irresponsible by my parents (BTW, do they know how much shit I've dealt with without help from ANYONE this year!?) I can't get my permit. I want to go down the street to Walmart to get my photos printed in time for seniors leaving. Now she wants to finish her TV program, which is eight hours long. ASS. If she wants to watch reality colonial shit, she can get her ass of the couch and walk around CW and if your watching TV for that long, it better NOT be PB fucking S! It ends at eight, when the one hour photo center closes which is what the Fuji machine runs from. It is a holiday tomorrow (memorial day) so I can't get them done as the booths close.  Argh, so I'm going to use priority shipping from EZPrints so they get here quick enough. At least they wont be shitty quality. I still have to wait forever so my mom will type in her credit card number. She doesn't trust me with it as I could steal the numbers and buy stuff. Yes, because I'm that dishonest and could never get caught as it wouldn't come on her credit card bills from the bank I would do it. Yes, I am one dishonest dumbfuck. She can suck Beans left boob. Now to configure the ezprints info for the 50th time today so I get all the prints I want.   ASS   Rant over...

      I found a birdie! He flew in through my garage and kept running into windows. I picked him up after he got stuck under some shelves. I sued a towel because birdies have nasty thingies in their feathers. Then the bird wouldn't fly away, it kept tweeting at me. Then it started hovering above my hand before landing on it again. Finally it flew straight at my face and all was good.  I would have some pictures but my mom wouldn't take them and she definitely wouldn't hold the bird...

I can't even hang with my best friend because i work so much, and now some emotionally unstabled ass walked into my life. Apparantly he is a wreck and he deserves it for making other people feel bad for him, molesting me, and being antisocial.  Argh I hate my life, why the fuck cant i just get out of this house  one day a week  for reasons other thant work?!?  Bean, call me tomorrow, i forgot to talk to you about something.

F) Tried to watch TV G) Why the fuck do you think those hickies were on my back!? H) I could name a million more  Please refrain from calling my best friend... She doesn't like you either...

      SO i made 77 bucks in tips yuesterday, Damn relious bitches from church didnt tip in the AM. I took out 52 fucking dollars of fast food and got 46 cents that a lot ofr food specially the XL drinks for the obese man in the front seat.  To all you obese fat dumbasses, ordering 44 ounces of soda is not good for you, adding 25 packets of salt to your fires isn't good. Ordering 3 combos for youself but topping it off with a DIET coke isn;t going to help much either.  My boss got a call from the putsourcers and i have to get some immigration shit copied :/  We have to figure out which of 20 diffrent numbers he needs.   I learnt how to take orders today... It's better than makign drinks...  LIME IS NOT GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN! It burns in your eyes too...  Bean, How was UVA? I might be carhopping 2morrow (Tuesday, it starts in 10 minutes so stop by from 11-5, request Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... Call me 2morrow if i don't see you or I will call you     I have Wednesday OFF!     I'm so fucking bored. Time for a bubble bath!

       WTF!?!    Why do Bean and I keep getting nasty ass people hit on us!?!. Dude, i had a 40 year old im me from a personals site looking for 'conversation' It was a gayy teen personals. I called him a pedophile and teased him. He was ugly. This is Beans E:mail            I teach Physics in a high school and I am very interested in science, philosophy, political and social issues, as well as in women's and gay people's rights. Love movies, theater, music, to dance, to swim, to travel, to make and meet friends. Good food and wine, and also good sex. I am not into any steady relationship right now but not closed to it either. I am rather flirtatious (in person and also on the web) and quite adventurous sometimes. I look very feminine (I am told that I am sensuous too) and I feel often attracted to women who are quite older than myself (that does not exclude younger ones, though). Rather on the fem side but enjoying the active role as well. Looking for friends and pen pals I could meet if we click (I travel quite a lot!).   HAHAHA!

      So, I worked a whole shit load this week. My paycheck gives me money from the last 2 weeks so in my first week of work I made 241 bucks ($205.68 is mine after taxes)  This Saturday I worked  12 fucking  hours with one break. Yep, and I bet I lost some money because my tips sucked...  I originally planned to buy a $1,500 computer because my dad said he'd pay half. Since my brother already bought a cheap one that he replaced already cause it sucked, my dad told me he wasn't paying that much. So, I;m buying a barebones system because then all I need is a video card, but the asshole wont pay 350 now that I make money. If this were my brother he would have gotten it. The barebones system is really good though and is 682 total + shipping.  Bean, I'm calling you, be ready.

Bean is in some random place in Maryland... Fun. I'm stuck in the burg.  Bean, do you want to plan a trip to DC or Nagshead for a weekend maybe?  I am saving for my $1,300  camera, along with a UV filter for it and Nikon Capture 4.1. Overall, this will cost me around $1,450 with shipping. Then i have to insure the Bitch on the rents homeowners insurance in case i drop it. Not good.  It is a sexy Camera. The Nikon D70.

      So, after leaving work (i got cahsed out in under five minutes) I was told to go to the hospital. I am peeing blood with my urine (UGH!) and might be passing kidneystones. :( I'm like 16, can i get Kidney stones?  Now I have to strain my Pee... Great.  My second load of computer parts aren't here yet. Yesterday, I ordered some speakers too and a new sound card. 5.1 =  Fucking awesome   I can't wait for my skates to arrive... They might actually fit and not bruise my feet.  No work tomorrow( and probably Monday) because I have a doctors note!

        time for an update! So i realized that i haven't really done anything productive this summer...this came to my attention when my father asked why i don't have friends or a boyfriend..haha...he really needs to get over that boyfriend thing, i'm intent on staying with  amanda  for as long as humanly possible :) i also just realized that i totally forgot to do my video documentary of this summer, starting with me speaking at graduation and proceeding to get wasted that night and then jumping into college creek while wearing my cap and gown.....how could i have forgotten such a monumental moment in my life? haha. So my UVA departure is nearing, I can't wait until i am away from bitch and my father for a while..maybe we'll start to like each other when we're all away from each other for a while...at least my dad won't be around to tell me i can't go see my significant other (i felt like using a different word there haha) i got a brilliant idea to make soy milk ice cream and market it to the lactose intolerant population of the world, but maybe soy milk ice cream already exists...if it does i'd probably be a dumbass and put whipped cream on it anyways, thus defeating the purpose of soymilk ice cream. i envy people that can freely enjoy milk without the devestating effects of being lactose intolerant. I would like to eat ice cream for just one day in my life without throwing up; i'd probably eat like 6 gallons of it and throw up anyway haha...i think that's enough of my random as hell thoughts for now, although i could go on forever, but i'll wait until i write my bestselling book, Spilling the Beans, for that haha

      So, I'm now going to the hospital next friday for a renal ultrasound for my kidneys. Thjats fine. I'm also going to get a catheter stuck up my dick. Great! I'm so excited... NOT! I told my Mom I'm not doing it unless they knock me out. Oh God, this is going to hurt.  My mom is also bitching me out BECAUSE I'm CLEANING my room. She's afraid i'm going to take the color out of the carpet where the dog peed. Hmm, you wont lemme shampoo it so i'm putting pet stain remover down bitch, like it or not.  I'm off work again because I can't work 9 hours... I told him I'd work the Lunch Shift.
