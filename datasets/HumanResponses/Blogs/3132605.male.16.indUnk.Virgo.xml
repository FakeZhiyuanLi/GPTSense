      I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you   THE REASON by:hoobastank  urlLink

      Man, i hate this, i need a girl back in my life. they just seem to fill an empty void that nothing else can fill. I just miss having it in my life. Its just for some reason my whole being happy depends on it and i dont know y. mabey its because girls always were a big deal in my life and they were the only thing that made me happy. I dont know. but hopefully that one will find me and make me the real me again. some thing that doesn't happen very often

      Well, i have to say rain changes my mood... its weird, i seem to think more clearly when it rains. I feel like i can just sit and stare at the rain with out feeling i have anything else to worry about. I just imagine that i sitting there with my girl alone together just watching the rain. it sooths me to know that there is one girl out there that can fulfil this stupid day dream. Hopefully i may have just met her, butt ne way.... rain can be amazingly beautiful and incredibly depressing at the same time. i feel as though i slowly slipping back to thoes places i dont want to return to. and now with this new person i dont know how my life is goin to change.    hopefullly it will be a good change but i desperatly need something to cheer me up during this rain......   Also i have found my love for barbershop music grows. i know weird, bu i dont know i just cant get the amazing harmonies out of my head and its driving me nuts my group doesnt want to work to be good. If you could get past the cheezey old songs you would find some of the most amazing four part harmony songs ever created recently. I just cant get them out of my head. and their harmonies are sooo sooothing..... but w/e  MEH, Joe

      sleepless nights have come again. Once again i am kept awake by many thoughts running through my head.  about anything and nothing and they keep me awake.  they come to me but i have nothing to do with them.   hummmmmm...      i wonder......     why???     this is what is going on inside my head and it drives me nuts!!

      Well i thank Zach for showing me this journalthingyhooblamadoodle. But ne way, i find that... well...WOMEN SUCK.......though some of u are ok the vas majority just screws with me haha.you will come ot find that most of my journals will be somewhere along these lines. I just cant figure it out though... how does phil mickelson have such an incredibly hot wife. i bet it just the money.,.,.,. oh wait hes a really nice guy haha thats oh and mabey u girls should think about that now. the hott guys are not always going to be the most sucsessful and nice in life. that guy thats going ot be the one u want to marry might be slightly over weight or slightly nerdy but has a  huge heart. try looking at them from a different angle because a lot of times they get tierd of hearing about your problems because they want you to themselves sooo bad(and no im no the only one in this situation so dont im me and complain)

      well i guess im more popular than i thought. people have my sn that i dont even know. right now im in the process of watching the matrix. i dont even like this movie till the very end when neo finds out hes the chosen one. but ne way, im having mixed feelings right now. im really really happy cuz i get to see jessi this weekend, but on the other hand i have a research paper (rough draft) due on tues and im not doing to well in english. w/e the thing that gets me through the week is getting to hang out with jessi cuz she is just soo layed back and doesn't care. she just likes to have fun which is very comforting

      well i went out with jessi for the first time last night . we went and saw mean girls. Man when did that red head lindsay w/e her name is grow boobs. That whole movie was based on her boobs. well ne way. i had a ton of fun which suprised me cuz we really didn't do to much. i think this may end up being something good, one because her parents trust me to drive her after only meeting her once and she actually want to go out again(even though my car smells like mildew because my window broke and of course it rained right after it broke) but we are goin out next weekend too and i cant  wait. thanks jessi

      okay so today my dad woke me up at 5:30 so that i could take out the trash. now usually this would be ok, but i had gone to be bed at 3:30 sooooooo i was quite pissed.  ne way after that i went back to bed until 12:30. when i was awoken again this time by my mom as she started with her daily nagging. clean the house she says. so im in the process of dooin this now.   of course i serinade my self with the wonderful stylings of barbershop groups such as BSQ, Acoustix, and 12th street rag. the one thing about barbershop is you can always sing along with it cuz most of the chord changes are the same. w/e i like it  hum i wanna go away to like new york or something ne one wanna come with me??
