      Now that I've started blogging I must remember to take my mobile phone camera out with me more often.  It's amazing what you miss sometimes.  I'll try and remember for work tomorrow.

      I love Pratchett's books.  A great combination of black humour, social satire and delicate humanism.  Mort, which I think was the third Discword book, is one of his best.  In it Death, the Discworld's slightly reluctant grim reaper, decides to take an apprentice.  I won't go further into a synopsis; instead read the book - it's well worth it.  I found out about the radio play on the off-chance and in fact missed the broadcast.  Happily the BBC have a 'listen again' feature online which lets you, erm, listen again to the latest episode of certain shows.  I'm not a huge fan of the BBC and their wretched licence fee but 'listen again' almost makes up for it.  You can catch the latest episode of Mort at: http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/comedy/mort.shtml  *SPOILERS!*  As always with dramatisations, the book is abridged.  A shame, because you miss out on Pratchett's little asides where he goes off on a tangent or fills in some back story.  A shame, but necessary if you want to keep it to four, half-hour slots.  You won't notice this in a skillfully abridged show (or if you've never read the book) but unfortunately it's not the best.  I expect newcomers would be lost after about five minutes while  Pratchett fans would really spot the gaping holes where great writing used to be.  So: deterring newcomers and Pratchett fans alike.  It kind of makes the whole exercise rather pointless.  Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh.  It's certainly well acted; Mort's father, Albert and Ysabel sound as you'd expect.  Unfortunately the king who's assassination lets Mort know exactly what he's let himself in for sounds predictably like Prince Charles.  They all have good comic timing though.    The stock sound effects are excrutiatingly cheesy (horse neigh #4, squeeky door #2).  I'd have expected something more realistic from the guys who came up with the effects for Doctor Who and the Goons.  Ultimately the dramatisation succeeds or fails because of Death.  Death's voice is supposed to sound like it arrives directly in your head rather than through your ears.  It should be deep, like the slamming of coffin lids underground. Hell, in the books everything Death says IS IN CAPITAL LETTERS.  I always imagined it as a more British Darth Vader, you know.  A deep, resonant voice which makes some of the things Death says even funnier (OH, BUGGER.).  Wht we get instead is a voice strikingly reminiscent of Jon Rhys-Davies' Treebeard from Lord of The Rings.  It's well acted, but it ain't Death.  I don't think I'll bother with the other episodes, but if you're a fan of Terry Pratchett then it's probably worth the curiosity value.  Find it at www.bbc.co.uk.

      ...to see.  Ah ha ha.  Just kidding - hopefully it'll last a bit longer than these two posts.  Frankly, if I have trouble keeping myself interested in this God knows how anyone else will be.    I doubt there'll be an overall theme to the blog but perhaps that'll develop as time goes by.  I expect it'll be one of those streams-of-conciousness things with maybe some profound insight stuck in there by accident.  I don't know how private/personal the blog will be either; I'm always acutely embarassed about showing my true feelings to people - hence the 'Ironclad' moniker - but we'll see how it goes.

      In an effort to improve my geek credientials I thought I'd start one of these blog things (come on - as soon as you say to someone, "Hi, I work in IT" they mentally superimpose your face with a pair of jam jar specs and a big greasy beard, so I might as well embrace it).  I have no idea how long this little experiment may last as every other diary I started ended after about three days.  So we'll just have
