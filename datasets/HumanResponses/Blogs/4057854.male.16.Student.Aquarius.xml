        urlLink Major security holes found in Internet Explorer   A WHOLE TRIO  or troika of security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, Secunia reports.  The problems apply to Internet Explorer 5.01, 5.5, and to IE 6.0, said the security firm late today.  But Microsoft has plugged the holes, which allow alien surfers to mess with your machine.  The "exploits" include bypassing the so called "zone restrictions" and there's a boundary error exploit too. Microsoft has patched the patches, and there's more information at the Secunia website, here, as well as at Microsoft.com.  The list is lengthy. Patch as you must.   Thanks to  urlLink The Inquirer  for the info   Some more reasons to stop using Internet Explorer and start using alternatives such as Firefox.

I personally don't believe many of the articles writen in there, but who knows, maybe google is trying to get money by selling your personal searches to a third party advertising company.   urlLink   http://www.googlefight.com/  this site offers a cool service that lets you enter 2 search terms and gives you the number of google results for each term and tells you who is the winner.  One of the best search term to try is "Microsoft vs. Linux" the results are pretty close, see for yourself who wins ;-)

         urlLink     urlLink           REDMOND, Wash., July 28, 2004 In preparation for the launch of Nintendo DS in North America and Japan later this   year, Nintendo today announces major global developments for the innovative dual-screen, wireless, hand-held video game system.              Nintendo DS, originally chosen as the code name, has been selected as the official product name. The Nintendo DS name evokes the idea of a portable system with "dual screens," providing the rationale for the final name. T  he hardware also has been redesigned to sport a slimmer, sharper look. The retooled Nintendo DS features a thinner, black base and an angular platinum flip-top cover. The face buttons and shoulder buttons are larger, and some have been reconfigured for optimum use. The unit includes a new storage slot for the touch screens stylus, and the speakers now broadcast in stereo sound, with or without headphones.             "The Nintendo DS will change the future of hand-held gaming," says Satoru Iwata, president of Nintendo Co., Ltd. "Dual screens, chat functions, a touch screen, wireless capabilities, voice recognition-- these abilities surpass anything attempted before, and consumers will benefit from the creativity and inn  ovation the new features bring to the world of video games."             Software companie  s worldwide have more than 120 Nintendo DS games in development. Nintendo alone is developing more than 20 titles, and in excess of 100 companies have signed on to create games for the n  ew system.             "The innovative functions make Nintendo DS a superior game device, while the chat feature and ability to detect other DS units make it a social device as well," says Reggie Fils-Aime, Nintendo of Americas executive vice president of sales and marketing. "Weve figured out the magic of what makes po  rtable game play so attractive to consumers. Weve defeated nine challengers and once again were prepared to win."                    Nintendo will announce the launch date, price and game lineup for        Nintendo DS at a later date.          Thanks to  urlLink Nintendo.com  for the pictures and information.

       Over 60 people join Cinefour's 'Halo' tourney  NORTH LOGAN -- Parents beware: If you didn't think video games could get more addictive for your kids, think again.  Cinefour theaters in North Logan started a new trend Friday night in video gaming in Cache Valley. Theater managers took four video projectors, set one up in each of four theaters with a Microsoft XBox video game system connected to it, and then let the fun begin for more than 60 people.  "Tonight blew our minds," theater co-owner Calvin Timothy said afterward. "We're definitely going to keep doing this."  The game Friday night: "Halo" -- a first-person shoot-em-up game in which four people can play on a team against four others. The evening was set up in a tournament format where 16 teams battled each other until the wee hours of Saturday morning to find out who the kings of gaming are in the valley.  Rick Shurtliff said he drove to Logan from Bountiful just to play in the tournament. He said he often plays four to five hours a night with his friends anyway, so to play it on a huge screen makes it that much better.  "This is going to revolutionize game play," he said.  If playing video games on a movie screen is going to revolutionize game play, Timothy said, Cinefour will be one of the first in the country to do it.  "According to the gal at the licensing company, we're the first theater ever to license XBox with them for a theater," Timothy said. "It took an act of Congress and a blessing of God (to get the license)."  To accommodate large gaming crowds, the theater purchased eight 34-inch televisions to put in the theater lobby.  The idea for the gaming came from Brady Walker, son of Kelly Walker, part owner of Cinefour and owner of Walker Cinemas in Brigham City.  Brady Walker said he brought a video projector home from school one day and asked his dad if he could take it to the movie theater and play video games on it.  The idea turned out to be a good one, and Walker said he wanted to expand it.  "I tried multiple ways to get money, then talked to Calvin, who put up the money for it," Brady Walker said.  Based on Friday's turnout, the idea is a success for Timothy and the Walkers.  Timothy said he would like to see the game tournaments expanded in the future, both within Cinefour and to the Brigham City theaters. When the sequel to "Halo" -- "Halo 2" -- debuts in stores later this year, Timothy said, it would be possible to connect the North Logan and Brigham City theaters and have the two battle one another over the Internet.  The best part of playing on a large theater screen, said gamer Anthony Stocks, is that you can actually see what you're doing.  "You've got room to move when you can see a bigger picture," Stocks said. "When you have (multiple) people playing on a small TV screen, you can't tell what's going on."  Timothy said tournament entry fees are $60 for a team of four. There is a $3 charge for spectators to watch the games. Right now, tournaments are scheduled for Friday nights at midnight, but preregistration is required. For more information on gaming tournaments at Cinefour, contact the theater at 752-8377.   urlLink Source

       WHILE MICROSOFT and AMD are suggesting it will be well into next year before the final version of WinXP 64 is released, yesterday it started offering a fresh preview edition of its up-and-coming software which now supports both Intel and AMD 64-bit microprocessors, it appears.  It has also done some wizardry in the back office and changed the name of Windows XP 64-bit for Extended 64-bit Systems to Windows XP Pro X64 edition - certainly less of a mouthful.  The beta will take you fair time to download, even if you've got broadband, and includes support for Bluetooth and extended language support.   urlLink Source

       Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked beans. He loved them, but they always had an embarrassing and somewhat lively reaction on him. One day he met a girl and fell in love. When it became apparent that they would marry, he thought to himself, she'll never go through with the marriage with me carrying on like this, so he made the supreme sacrifice and gave up beans.  Shortly after that they were married. A few months later, on his birthday and on the way home from work, his car broke down. Since they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her that he would be late because he had to walk home. On his way home, he passed a small cafe and the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him. Since he still had several miles to walk he figured he could walk off any ill affects before he got home. It was, after all, his birthday. So he went in and ordered, and before leaving had 3 extra large helpings of baked beans.   All the way home he putt-putted. By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe. His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited. She exclaimed, "Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!" She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the table and made him promise not to peak. At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on. Just as his wife was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang. She again made him promise not to peek until she returned, and away she went to answer the phone. While she was gone, he seized the opportunity. He shifted his weight to one leg and let go. It was not only loud, but ripe as a rotten egg. He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned the air about him. He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on. He raised his leg and RRIIPPP !!! It sounded like a diesel engine revving, and smelled worse. To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms a while, hoping the smell would dissipate. He got another urge. This was a real blue ribbon winner, the windows shook, the dishes on the table rattled and a minute later the flowers on the table were dead.  With his blindfold still on, when he heard the phone farewells he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded his hands on top of it. Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of innocence when his wife walked in. Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner table. After assuring her he had not peeked, she removed the blindfold and yelled, "SURPRISE!!!"  To his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated around the table for his surprise birthday party.

       A SURVEY conducted by support firm the Geek Squad claims that Americans are more scared of losing data on computers than death, the taxman or public speaking.  The telephone survey of 1039 adults living in private households claims that two thirds of US citizens think computer technology is a necessary evil, but four in 10 say they can't live without their computers.  And if a fire affected their houses, after they saved their family and friends, 40% would choose the computer to save next.  Not, apparently, the pooch, the pussy, or the budgerigar.  If this survey really reflects the opinion of your average American, there's something wrong somewhere, surely? After all, if you die, your PC isn't going to be of much use to you, is it?   urlLink Source

       A former child-care worker is facing a child neglect charge after she helped her 5-year-old son smoke crack cocaine in her home, authorities said.  Her son told an interviewer that he had taken his mother's "medicine" three times.  Andrea Wilkey, 40, 700 block of East 93rd Street, was arrested after the boy tested positive for crack cocaine on Aug. 7.  Marion County Prosecutor Carl Brizzi said the boy told his grandmother what he had done and she took him to St. Vincent Hospital.  According to police, she told health care workers that her grandson was "acting funny." After a toxicology report revealed cocaine, a Child Protection Services caseworker was assigned to the case.  Brizzi termed the case horrendous.  "Sharing a crack pipe with your 5-year-old is no way to bond," he said.  The good news, he said, is that the boy appears to be OK.  At the hospital, the boy was taken into custody and then released into his grandmother's temporary care.  The caseworker and Marion County Sheriff's Detective Julie McHenry interviewed Wilkey on Sunday.  She admitted that she had smoked crack cocaine on Aug. 6 from a homemade "bong," a baby food jar with a glass pipe and tubing.  Wilkey said she left the room. When she returned, her son was sitting at the table before the bong. He said, "Come on. Let me do it," according to Wilkey.  The mother said she then used a lighter to ignite the crack cocaine, turning off the lighter after she saw smoke coming from her son's mouth.  Wilkey said she took her son to her mother's house the following day so she could go to a job interview.  Wilkey told investigators that she had been using cocaine "on and off" for about 10 years, and that her son had seen her using the bong before.  A spokeswoman with the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, which oversees CPS, could not be reached for comment.  When the boy was interviewed Monday, he said his mother took her medicine by placing white powder in a bowl and lighting it. The boy said, "I did it, too."  Brizzi said Wilkey had been employed as a child care worker at the Julian Center, a shelter for battered women. Ann DeLaney, executive director of the center, could not be reached for comment Friday night.  According to bail records, Wilkey had been working for about a month for a medical firm before her arrest.  She was being held in the Marion County Jail; bail was set at $25,000. An initial plea of not guilty was entered on her behalf during an initial hearing this week.   urlLink Source

       A policeman who was determined to protect a royal oil painting from thieves accidentally tore a gaping hole in its canvas.  In the best traditions of the Keystone Cops and Inspector Clouseau, the unnamed officer is reported to have toppled from a chair while trying to close a window at St James's Palace.  The chair is believed to have collapsed and as the policeman fell, he grabbed some curtains and landed in a heap of fabric and oil painting.  A source quoted by the News of the World said: "He then saw the hole in the canvas. He still doesn't know how he did it. He either stuffed his hand through or a curtain hook ripped into it."  Fortunately for the officer, early reports that his fall had ruined a £1m painting by the Queen's favourite painter, George Stubbs, appeared to be incorrect. The damaged painting is believed to have been by a little-known 19th-century artist called G. Morley. Its value is unknown.  A spokeswoman for St James's Palace said it would be possible to repair the canvas by re-weaving it. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that a police officer damaged a painting at the palace at 8.30pm last Tuesday. "There will be no action taken because it was an accident," a spokesman said.   urlLink Source

        urlLink PhysOrg: Breakthrough Nanotechnology Will Bring 100 Terabyte 3.5-inch Digital Data Storage Disks     Have you ever dream of 100 terabyte of data per 3.5-inch disk? New patented innovation nanotechnology from Michael E. Thomas, president of Colossal Storage Corporation, makes it real.  Michael invented and patented the world's first and only concept for non-contact UV photon induced electric field poling of ferroelectric non-linear photonic bandgap crystals, which offers the possibility of controlling and manipulating light within a UV/Deep Blue frequency of 1 nm to 400 nm.  It took him 14 years to find a practical conceptualization that would work to advance the storage industry; 3D Volume Holographic Optical Storage Nanotechnology, for which Michael holds the patents. He was invited to present this fascinating discovery to the National Science Foundation in February 2004.  This invention and patents on a technique for changing matter at the molecular level is one of the World's only new enabling technologies, having many hundreds of electro-optic applications.  Atomic Holographic Nanotechnology will allow for the first time a functional method for programmable molecular lenses that will allow incoming light to be rejected, modified internally, or allowed to pass unaltered through a transparent lens known as disk, tape, card, drum, film, etc.  By being able to program optical lenses, many applications based on light and color can be developed, such as holographic storage, bio-terror detection devices, optical electronics, security products, and hundreds of other products never seen before on the world's markets.  The small size of ferroelectric transparent structures makes it possible to fabricate nano-optical devices, such as volume holographic storage, having both positive and negative index of refraction that will allow molecular particles of an atomic size to be modified, controlled, and changed to perform a specific function, desired task, used for low cost accurate chemical / biological matter detection, and reprogrammed to accept new non-volatile data and molecular functions.

        A man went to his doctor and asked him how to prolong the lovemaking experience. The doctor told him that masturbating before sex often helped men last longer, extending the pleasure for them and their partner.  The man decided, "What the hell, I'll try it."  He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it. He couldn't do it in his office. He thought about the restroom, but that was too open. He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe. Finally, he came up with a plan.  On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck.  Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to masturbate. He closed his eyes and thought of his lover.  As he grew closer to orgasm, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants. Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, "What?"  He heard, "This is the police. What's going on down there?"  The man replied, "I'm checking out the rear axle, it's busted."  Came the reply, "Well, you might as well check your brakes too while you're down there, because your truck rolled down the hill five minutes ago."

        urlLink AppleInsider | iTunes coming to Linux  While Apple Computer has not yet decided to bring its iTunes jukebox software over to the Linux platform, a start-up software developer from St. Paul, Minnesota claims to have accomplished the task.  Advertisement CodeWeavers, a company which specializes in software that lets Windows programs run on Linux, told CNet on Monday that it is developing a new version of its software that adds support for Apple's iTunes.  The company said CrossOver Office 3.1 will add support for iTunes and is currently in preview form. The preview is being made available only to existing CrossOver Office customers, though a final version is expected later this year.  Apple's iPod also works natively under Windows and the Mac OS, though the company does not officially support Linux.  "iTunes has been our No. 1 most requested application," CodeWeavers CEO Jeremy White said in a statement. "We remain confident that by the end of 2005, the majority of Windows applications will be supported by CrossOver Office. Until then, we're pleased to be bringing the appeal of iTunes to Linux users through the development of version 3.1."
