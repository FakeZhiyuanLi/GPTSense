      Whoo hoo!  Yay Blog!  I have to make this short because Scott and I are off to the west side of the state for a wedding.  Its actually for the other OC couple from our year.  Well, I'm off.  I'll write all about it when I get back.

      So why does WSU have to mow all the lawns on the same day?  And why do they have to start at my building?  I have been sneezing all morning with no signs of stopping!  WAH!  I want my Claritin!    On the plus side, I get to have a bridal shower!!  Its on June 11th and I can't wait.  I didn't know if I was going to have one or not.  The only sad thing is that Hana won't be able to be here for it.  I miss my Hana! :(    Wedding planning is so crazy.  I had no idea all the little things you have to deal with.  Its kinda driving me nuts!  I'll be lucky to come out of this alive.  The invitations go out this week, and then I think all hell breaks loose!  Oh well.  Two months and it will be over and I will be Ms. Jennifer Carson (I am not going to be a Mrs. if I can work it right!)

      Wow, quite the weekend.  We went to Annie and Quinn's wedding.  It was nice.  If we hadn't changed our wedding colors, it would have been the same wedding.  We got to see lots of people that we hadn't seen in a while (a few that could have stayed that way).  A lot of people asked about our wedding, and I felt bad because we weren't able to invite any of them.  Money is just too tight to be inviting an extra 40 people.    After the wedding, we went to the Mariner's game and watched them lose...what a shock.  They really suck this year, but that isn't too big of a problem, because when or lose you still gotta love the Mariners.  Dan Wilson played in the 9th inning, but we had to leave a little early so I only got to see him catch about 10 pitches.    The weather was weird this weekend.  Pouring rain all over the state, super gusty winds in Eastern Washington and tornados...yes thats right, tornados, in Spokane!  Check it out:   urlLink Tornado 1   and  urlLink Tornado 2   Craziness!  Pure craziness!

      Well, there is nothing on TV (except the Stanley Cup...big deal though) and the Rec Center is closed, and Scott is gaming, so its a very boring night.  I did make Black Cherry Kool Aid which is quite good, and maybe I will watch a movie.    My fingers hurt too, because I went to ADPi today, and spent a couple hours ripping old contact paper off particle board furniture...thrilling, let me tell you.  But things were looking a lot better when I left.  I was kinda pissed though because the house was TRASHED.  If I didn't know any better I would have said it was a fraternity.  I am disappointed the sisters didn't clean up before they left.  Now we have to spend a lot of time cleaning before we can start with the painting and everything.  Oh well, it will look beautiful when we are done.    Scott and I got our engagement pictures done today too.  I'm sure they will be super cute!  There were some of us in front of a barn, in a field of daisies, and in a tree among other things.  It started pouring while we were out, but I'm sure they will be great anyway.  And I might have the proofs by Friday so I can show people at the shower.  That would be cool!

      So last night Scott and I got a free pizza from Papa Johns.  It was good.  I love free pizza.  They sent us some post card that apologized for their service and offered us a free large two topping!  We would have been crazy to pass that up!  So we got free pizza.  How many times can I say that?  Free pizza free pizza free pizza...ok I'm bored now.  THEN today I got a free T-shirt from Central Stores.  I had to go CS to get Reverse Transcriptase (an enzyme that turns RNA into DNA (kinda)) and RNase Out (na enzyme that eats stuff that eats RNA).  They are both made by a company called invitrogen.  Invitrogen was running a promotion that if you bought to of their product you get a free t-shirt.  So now I have had a free pizza and a free T-shirt in about 16 hours.  Life is cool!

      I really really really REALLY hate allergies.  It seems that the warmer it gets the worse my allergies get.  Its supposed to be 83 today, so you can guess how miserable I am.  I can barely think clearly.  I may have to avoid work if at all possible.  The last thing I need to do is to spill Ethidium Bromide on my legs.  That would suck.  I need to go buy more Claritin!  I am also excited because our first gift has been purchased off our registry!  Yay!  I guess it begins, since the bridal shower is in a week.  It will be fun to see everyone!     I think we are getting pizza for dinner.  Mmmm, pizza!

      I am tired.  I hate three dayt weekends becuase it is always so hard to get back into things.  It was a great weekend though.  Scott and I went to Spokane on Saturday to see his parents.  We went to Bostons....mmm, Bostons.  Then Sunday and Monday we completely goofed off.  We even played tennis yesterday.  Yay for tennis.    I have managed to get myself sucked back into ADPi.  Not that that is bad, I am glad to have some female friends, even if they are all on the internet.  (I love all my real life female friends too, I just never see them...stupid Pullman)  I am making my ADPi paddle because I always wanted one.  Unfortunately I just found out that ADPi doesn't like paddles, so I am doing a bad thing.  Oh well, it will be done tonight and no one will know that it is brand new.  I "get" to go paint the house this weekend.    And thanks to Hana, I have a cool  new game to play...Civ III.  Its really fun, but really addicting.    Well, I am off to lift weights.

      Here is the deep question of the day:  Was Bingo the name of the farmer or the dog?  Its a good question I think.    Scott and I went to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban tonight.  It was good, but I was slightly disappointed.  I miss the old Dumbledore and the old director.  We then went to wingers.  It was nummy!  Tomorrow is my bridal shower.  I can't wait.  Apparently there is a chance 20 people will be there!!!!  Thats crazy!

      I had steak for dinner tonight.  I had steak last night too.  Steak is good.  We had a couple in the freezer that were left over from a BBQ we had a few weeks ago.  So I BBQd them with Mrs. Dash.  It was soooo good.  I haven't had any red meat in a couple weeks, so it was a nice change.    Now I need ice cream.  I'm not sure I can convince Scott to go to Dairy Queen though.  We went yesterday and I think two days in a row might be too much, but I LOVE DQ.  I especially love the Pecan Mudslide.  Its so good.  Last night I wanted a Whopper blizzard (Malted milk balls, not the hambuger) but they don't make Whopper blizzards.  So I had an M&M blizzard.  But now I need a pecan mudslide...yes I NEED it!!!  MMM, mudslide!  Scott and I are going out to dinner tomorrow night though, and going to see Harry Potter.  Yay for date night!

      So I would like to know who took our summer, and when they are bringing it back.  It is all windy and rainy here today. I got rather muddy walking to work this morning.  I'm all better now though.  I met with the florist yesterday and got our wedding flowers all figured out.  My bouquet is blue hydrangeas and white gerber daisies (same with Amanda and Hana's) and then the other three just have the blue hydrangeas.  All the bouquets are going to be hand-tied, and mine will even have several little violets in it!  Yay!  Now we just need to get tuxes, and a cake, and meet with the minister.  We're coming down home stretch now!

      I'm broke.  I hate being broke.  This wedding is going to make me go in debt before we are even married!  All I want to go buy is a new bra and some shoes, but I can't afford that!!  GRR!  I think I may get a job at Subway or something next fall.  Just something to help make ends meet.  If I worked about 8 hours a week, that would still be an extra $100 or so every pay day.  That $100 could go into savings so we could actually have money when we graduate!  I like this idea.  Plus I could work during band, so then I would have an even better reason for not being there this year.  So far there are 33 people coming to the wedding (official RSVPs).  I can handle 33...but I think it will end up being a lot more then that.    I'm tired and want to go home.  But really, what would I do at home that I can't do here?  All I do either place is surf the web, except here I get annoyed by my coworkers, and there I can watch TV and/or nap.  I think I answered my question.  I should go home.

      Its been in the eighties all week, and today we will be luck if we break 60.  That sucks.  I get to go back to ADPi again today.  Hopefully there will be no more contact paper for me, my fingers still hurt!    We have to mail out the last of the invitations today, and go to the rec center.  We may also need to go to the tux place, and get some food.  We have no food here.  Well, we have food, but nothing that you would want to eat on its own...like shredded cheese.  We also need ice cream.  Yum...ice cream!!!

      I really don't have time to be sick right now.  This is my only week without Marion, and so I want to enjoy every minute of it.  Plus I have orchestra tomorrow, and I am supposed to be helping paint over at ADPi.  At some point we need to look at tuxes, and the new Alive session starts on Saturday.  I don't have to do anything for that until Monday, but still.  Why can't I just sleep in and not feel gross?  Hopefully my experiment will work today.  I would like to have an "in your face" moment when Marion comes back.  I'mn a horrible human being.    I REALLY want McDonalds!  It sounds sooooo good right now.  I love greasy bad-ness.

      Why OH why can't I find my DVDs in this town.  I want the first season of Dead Like Me, this totally awesome Showtime tv program.  Unfortunately, you can not get it anywhere in the Pullman Moscow area.  We also couldn't find the 2nd season of Aqua Teen Hunger Force (some weird cartoon Scott likes) but I don't mind that one as much.   I think I am getting sick, and I am NOT happy about it!  I don't have time to be sick.  I have orchestra this week, and we are painting at ADPi, and I am enjoying having the lab all too myself.  Its so nice not to have to answer to anyone for awhile.  Unfortunately it will only last for two more days, but I will totally enjoy those days while they last!

      This has been an awesome weekend.  On Friday I had my bridal shower which was sooo much fun.  There were 15 people there and lots of food and games and punch.  It was awesome.  I will be posting pictures on my website either tomorrow or Tuesday.  I got all sorts of gifts including a picnic basket, a quesadilla maker, and a huge pyrex set!    Yesterday I had my dress fitting.  $150 to bustle and hem it!  I couldn't believe it! AND THEN they want me to come back on a Wednesday in July to try it on again.  I have to see if I can change the date on that.  If not, Mom will have to pick it up, and we will just trust them since I won't be able to do a final fitting.  After that, Mom and I went to the ballet.  We saw Midsummer Nights Dream.  It was really cool, and Scott agreed to go to the ballet with me if I wanted him to!  I bet he will try and get a job in some god forsaken place like Chewelah just to avoid the ballet.  No, he wouldn't move us to Chewelah because everyone knows that Chewelah is the den of all evil.

      Wow, I think I am officially a band geek!  Last night Scott and I went to a Drum Corps competition in Spokane.  (Drum Corps is like marching band without woodwinds or trombones, and freakin amazing choreography for the band and guard).  I have to say:  I LOVE DRUM CORPS!!!  It was so cool.  I wish I had known about it in high school because I think it would have been so much fun to be on the color guard for one of them (it would have been cool to be on the brass line too, but I don't think I could have learned my euph that fast back then).  I even bought a shirt for the Santa Clara Vanguard, who were definitely my favorite.  We also saw the Blue Devils, who are the defending world champions, but they weren't nearly as good.  Unfortunately, the Blue Devils still won by 0.1 points!  Oh well, maybe tonight will be Vanguard's night.  So in honor of my new love and respect for drum corps, I have added a link to Vanguard's website on the side of my blog.  Check it out!  While in Spokane, Scott and I also went shopping (got a movie and a video game) and went to Boston's, a great sports bar/pizza place.  It was a good night!

      I have a week and a half with absolutely nothing to do at work.  Marion proved that Lee's experiment didn't work (which is what all of my research is based off of).  Well, Lee is out of town, so he can't run a new experiment for me, and he took Marion's lab book, so I can't even starting writing up what she did in the research.  So I don't exactly know what to do.  I wouldn't mind just skipping work this whole week, but I don't think that is right.  Ah well, I'll keep myself entertained somehow.  Like writing in my blog...  Its really hot today.  It was yesterday too.  I think its supposed to be in the mid 90s, which isn't bad by itself, but I have to walk home still today, and 2 miles in 90 degree weather is not my idea of a good time.  But I am drinking lots of water, and I actually ate lunch today, which is kinda unusual for me.  OH!  We don't have to walk home.  I forgot Scott drove today!  YAY!!  So, tomorrow is another Alive session. After advising Scott and I are going up to Spokane for a band competition.  I am having visions of my future dancing in my head.  Actually it should be pretty cool.  Plus we are going shopping and out to dinner, which makes me happy!

      So poor Scott has to take this evil class that meets from 7:30-10:15 every morning.  Luckily its only for three weeks, but I still think it will be a long three weeks for both of us.  Its supposed to be almost 90 here today!! And its supposed to be over 90 tomorrow.  I don't like 90s.  90s suck!  The 1990s were cool though, and VH1 is going to have "I love the 90s" on starting next month!  YAY!    I found $10 on my way to work today.  I know I should turn it in to someone, but I don't know who.  I found it under a small bush in a parking lot.  If I found it in the building or so, that would be easy, but under a bush?  Maybe I can keep it...  I just don't know what is the right thing to do here.

      I hate being sick.  I hate it even more when I can't seem to get better.  Just when I think things are looking up, this cold hits me with something new.  I have been through coughing, wheezing, sore throat, runny nose, headache, dizziness and just plain icky feeling.  Now I have a stomach ache and fever.  Great...this is not what I need.  Well, I just got told to go home!  Whoo hoo!!!

      We are getting out of town!  Whoo hoo!  Scott and I are leaving for the Tri Cities later this morning.  I need to go pick him up from class soon.  We're going to come back here so he can take a short nap and we can get something to eat.  Then we will be off.  I am very excited.  We haven't been down to visit his parents since Spring Break, so it will be nice to see them, and be in a town that actually has stuff to do.  AND, I'm going to get new shoes while down there!  Vanguard got 2nd last night, so I am beginning to think this may not be their year.  They were .25 behind the Blue Devils last night.  However, this may not be the BDs year either considering the Cavies (from Indiana or something) is about 5 points ahead of everyone else competing right now. It will be interesting when they finally get to compete against each other (I think in the middle of July).

      Ok, so she's not dead...and she's not a witch, but Marion is on a plane back to Germany, and with any luck I will not hear from her again.  I think she may have changed the password on my computer before she left too because I can't get on it anymore.  Bitch!  (Am I allowed to write that?  I guess we'll find out)  Lab was so nice today, back to the way it is supposed to be...just me and Lee!  Whoo hoo!  One and a half months of peace and quiet, and then the new grad student starts.  Oh well, I will mold her in my image...poor Lee!  Today at advising Brianne actually told Don she would bring him cookies if he made her drum major!  I couldn't believe it.  I almost choked on my diet pepsi (which is bad enough without choking on it...)  I'm pretty sure the cookie bribe won't work though.  I think a decision has been made and really, Don can buy his own cookies.    On the drum corps front, they compete in Modesto tonight.  I will try and update the scores as soon as they are posted.  GO VANGUARD!

      Since no one reads this I can write this and nobody will know!  I think I want to do band again.  I really liked marching and super duper liked playing an instrument.  I will miss my euphonium if I am just sitting on the sidelines next year.  I wish there was a way I could play in the stands and play a halftime or pregame here or there, but I know that I will have to do all or nothing.  Plus with Scott as the Graduate Assistant, I don't know if this would be a good idea or not.  Maybe I need to talk it over with him...

If they don't read this then, well...they will never know.  :)  Ok, just kidding, but if you have a comment on my blog, please write it.  I get bored reading only my own ramblings all the time.  I am super duper hungry.  Its only 10:15 so it seems a little early for lunch, but I forgot breakfast, so it may be a long day.  I guess I could just eat my chips or something.  That would work.  I really want a cookie.  MMMMM...cookie!

      Only two more days of Marion and I am FREE!  She leaves on July 1st (Thursday) and then I will have a month or so of being the only person in the la again.  I realize I am spoiled, but I don't care.  I don't like sharing the lab with anyone but Lee.  And he is gone until next week.  Wow, lab is going to be quiet Thursday and Friday.  Of course, I won't be there Friday (Scott and I are going to the Tri Cities for the Fourth).  So instead of putting daily SCV updates up (they came in second yesterday in Kelso) I think I will just put them off to the side of the blog so people can keep up to date, but won't have to read anything unless something really cool happens.

      My eyes are itchy.  I think it may be time to go invest in some more Claritin.  I am tired of being a snotty mess.    Mom bought her dress for the wedding today.  Its dark blue with a chiffon coat that is dark blue and purple.  I guess its floor length.  I think she is going to be hot, but she said its perfect, so I believe her.  :)  I think the wedding is really starting to fall into place now.  All we need to do still (of the major things) is order the cake and go talk to the CUB witch lady.  I don't like her, can you tell?  I really want to go play with flags, but I don't have any.  I wonder if the band still has some under Bryan Hall?  Maybe Don and Scott would let me borrow on to play with...that would be so much fun!

      So the Drum Corps we saw on Friday competed again last night in Seattle.  SC Vanguard beat the Blue Devils this time by almost a point.  Much better then the 0.1 that the Blue Devils won by in Spokane.  Screw the Blue Devils (ok not really, I just got REALLY tired of hearing about them this last year).  I went and watered all the plants today.  I almost killed them last time I was left in charge, so I am trying to be REALLY good this time.  So far, so good, but its only been 2 days.    I had too much to drink last night.  We went over to Layne and Renee's place to hang out with them and Brian and Katharine.  It was tons of fun, and I heard Layne talk more then I ever have before!  It was crazy.  It was also crazy that all three couples will be married within 6 months.  Heck, 2 of the three will be married within 2 months!

      Sea foam green (well a sagey sea foam) to be exact.  I went to ADPi today to help paint and get the house all spiffy before rush...excuse me, recruitment starts.  The house is looking amazing, but they repainted the beautiful blue fireplace because at night it looked like a "big dark presence" in the living room.  Isn't thats what lights are for???  Oh well, it looks ok, but the blue was better.  Today we were painting the 1st floor lounge.  It looks tons better.  And the library just looks amazing.  It was painted "dill pickle" and is going to be the new TV room...who needs a library anyway?  I think Scott is mad at me, but I don't know what I did so I am not going to worry about it until he tells me whats wrong.  We went out to dinner though, so that was nice.  Now we will be eating pizza for the next 2 days!

      What is a wedding reception without food?  Not much, thats for sure!  In about an hour we will be sure that our wedding will have food...and lots of it.  I think there will be 12 "pieces" per person (if 150 people show up...which I think may be wishful planning).  Oh well, if there is too much, hopefully we can take a plate to the hotel, though Scott is still quite fond of going through the Wendy's Drive Thru in all our wedding gear!  What a great first meal as a married couple!  We also get to order the cake today...we better get to taste test it, or I am going to be cranky.  I have been looking forward to cake all week.   Oh yeah...and....ITS FRIDAY!!!!

      From now on, I will forever be known as "The Emperess of the Donut Coalition, Jennifer Ann Buren XVII"  Following the wedding, my new title will be, "The Great Winged Goat Person of Man-Cheap Canadian Beer Love, Jennifer Ann Carson"  Scott is  "Über-Footsoldier of Things That Go "Bump" in the Night, Scott Edward Carson"   urlLink What is your title?

      The wedding is really coming together.  We are meeting with the CUB on Friday to figure all that out.  I have the program almost done (just deciding which Moulin Rouge! love quote I want to use on the bottom of it).  Three of the groomsmen will be at the rehearsal for sure, and I think most of the bridesmaids, though I haven't heard from most of them yet.  We are one month away and counting!!  I wish the computers at work were functional, but maybe the techies will come fix them today.  That would rock.    I need to get back upstairs to the lab.  Lee should be getting there soon, and I need to find out if I actually have work to do.  Its nice, because we are running an experiment that I came up with.  This is a first for me, so I kinda hope it works, because that, too, would rock!

      Scott and I went to Moscow and bought our wedding rings today.  Mine is beautiful.  Its so unique, I've never seen anything like it.  It looks gorgeous with my engagement ring.  Everyone is going to be SOOOO jealous.  Scott's is really nice, but there aren't diamonds on it, so its not as cool as mine! :)    I also think we found the gospel reading.  I can't believe how hard this has been.  I am so an Old testament kinda girl.  But the reading we agreed on was John 13:34-35("I give you a new Law. You are to love each other. You must love each other as I have loved you. If you love each other, all men will know you are My followers.").  Sometime this week we are meeting with the CUB to figure out the food and such that we want.  Whoo hoo!  They actually called today and asked if we still needed it or if the event had already passed (considering its July 6, I am pretty sure we haven't gotten to August 7 yet....sigh)  Oh yeah, and GO VANGUARD

      Scott and I had a good time in the Tri Cities this weekend.  We got to eat lots of good food, see tons of fire works, and just hang out.  We went to a minor league game (the Tri City Dust Devils), but they lost.  We also got lots of shopping in.  It was a good weekend.

      C2 really isn't that bad.  I didn't know what to think from the "low carb Coke" commercials.  We weren't going to buy any since we are boycotting this whole "low carb" fad.  However, we were at Best Buy and they gave us a free one.  I figure no harm no foul, we didn't buy it so its all good.  And the thing is, it IS good!  I couldn't believe it.  It only has about 70 calories per can, and tastes just like RC Cola...and I love RC Cola.  Life is grand!

      VH1 is showing "I love the 90s" all week.  I, personally, do love the 90s and so I will lose about 10 hours of my week watching this horribly addicting show!  They have already talked about Family Matters/Urkel, "I'm too sexy", Ross Perot, and slap bracelets...and we're only 1/4 of the way through 1992.  We still have most of the 90s to go! Yay!!    I got my pretty new tiara yesterday.  Its gorgeous.  The announcements shipped today, so I think I know what I will be doing this weekend.

      The bride is starting to panic!  We have only had 70 people RSVP for the wedding!  Why aren't more people coming?  Why don't they love us?  I realize its in Pullman, but still!!  I want people there with us.  Its one of the most important days of our lives!  AHHHHHHH!  Another freak out...not many people have bought us gifts!  I am a little worried by this.  I always try to buy the gifts early, but apparently there must be something wrong with me.  AHHHHH!    I just need to keep repeating:  I will not become a bridezilla!  I will not become a bridezilla!

      I am soooo tired.  It is bedtime as soon as I am done with this.  I didn't get to sleep until after 3am.  Couldn't make my brain shut off.  We didn't do anything today.  It was awesome.  Well, we went and talked to some parents with the Alive program, but that was it.    I made strawberry kool aid.  Yum!  I don't want any caffeine because I want to be able to sleep.  We have to get up early to do Alive advising.  7:30 on campus comes really early, and the 6am alarm comes even earlier.

      Scott and I went to Seattle for the last few days.&nbsp; We went to the Mariner's game on Thursday and got to sit at the Hit It Here Cafe.&nbsp; It was sooo good.&nbsp; We had buffalo wings, two entrees (chicken strips for him, clam chowder in a bread bowl for me) and a big ol piece of chocolate cake.&nbsp; And the two best parts:&nbsp; Dan Wilson actually played and the Mariners actually won!&nbsp; It was a great day all around.  The next day I got my wedding dress back from alterations.&nbsp; Its beautiful.&nbsp; I almost cried when I put it on.&nbsp; I really can wait to be Scott's wife and for him to be my husband.&nbsp; It will be great.&nbsp; Now we just need to pay for everything!  We got a beautiful new coffee table today.&nbsp; Its our first "real" piece of furniture (not a handme down or a dumpster special).&nbsp; Its awesome!  Ok, its really hot in the office so I am going to go into the living room for awhile and cool down!&nbsp; Ciao!

      Ok, so I have been a slacker the last few days.&nbsp; We've been having car problems.&nbsp; The ignition tumbler is shot, so we had to take the car to Spokane.&nbsp; We went all the way there to be told they don't have the part and we will need to come back in a week and a half.&nbsp; Grrr.&nbsp; So that took care of Friday.&nbsp; Saturday and Sunday I really don't have an excuse other then I was lazy and had nothing to talk about. &nbsp; So we have almost all the RSVPs in and it looks like about 100 people will be at our wedding.&nbsp; Its smaller then we were expecting, but I think it will be good.&nbsp; Scott is kind of upset about it, but I think he is looking at it all wrong.&nbsp; With less people its more intimate, there is more food, its cheaper for us, and it will be less of a hassle.&nbsp; The people that really want to be there will be, so that is what matters.&nbsp;  &nbsp; We are going to Seattle on Thursday.&nbsp; I am excited because we are going to the M's game that night and get to sit at the Hit It Here Cafe.&nbsp; It should be tons of fun!&nbsp; I also get to pick up my dress and do other cool things like that! &nbsp; The wedding is now 19 days away!&nbsp; I'm going to be in Disneyland 3 weeks from today!&nbsp; YAY DISNEYLAND!

      Current Weather Report for August 7, 2004:&nbsp; High of 81, 0% chance of percipitation.&nbsp; Looks like it will be beautiful for the wedding.&nbsp;   Scott and I yet again have to drive to Seattle today.&nbsp; This should be the last trip there for awhile.&nbsp; We are marching with the band in the Torchlight Parade.&nbsp; I have to use this freakin' huge euphonium.&nbsp; I am not at all happy about this, but what can I do?&nbsp; Its not like I own my own horn or anything.

      So the wedding is 11 days from now!&nbsp; Oh my!&nbsp; I am so freakin excited, but it doesn't feel like its actually going to happen.&nbsp; We've been planning this way to long for it to only be about a week away.&nbsp; We have about a gazillion programs to work on (i have 22 of 120 done) and lots of other little things to do as well.&nbsp;   I really wish I could go to the rec center next week.&nbsp; I think it would be good to be able to use it to release some stress, but it will be closed for updating before school starts.&nbsp; Grrr

      The updated weather report: high of 78, low of 49, partly cloudy, 10% chance of precipitation.  Awesome!   Hana is on her way to Seattle as we speak.  Jenny flies in tomorrow with Amanda and Carol arriving Thursday.  My family gets here tomorrow night as well!!  YAY!   I don't know how we are going to pay for everything.  At the moment I am short about $300.  Hmm, I guess we'll figure that out when we get there.  There is always the credit card I guess!  Well, I am off to address some announcements!
