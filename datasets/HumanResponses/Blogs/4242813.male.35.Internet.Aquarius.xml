      okay - It was my first day at work at my new position at register.com.  It was a long one, but the bus ride to and from the city made it lower stress than fighting the traffic on the NJ Parkway.  No time tonight to write more - gotta go.

      Allright - so i have officially made the move to home depot to outline what i am going to have to do to paint the apartment.  It is pretty apparent that I am not going to get much helf from my roommate, even though he and his former roommate completely screwed it up.  They had a descent Idea, and a shitty plan from what I understand.  The materials will cost me about 150 dollars, and Ollie wants to help me for aboutr 40.00.  Not a bad deal if he doesn't screws up what I am trying to accomplish.  Anyway - I think the colors will be a cool contrast, and I can make it look pretty smooth.  I also want to have the couch steam cleaned, and I wonder what a cover will do for it???

      I have to say that I am sorry that this is the first post.  In fact I'll follow the previous statement up with - I'm generally a happy guy.  But right now I am so infuriated, that well, I would have torn my apartment apart - If I didn't have to put it back together.  Anyway, here's the story. . .  I have this roommate. . .  No first let me say - I am trying to rebuild my life, and it has been a long frustrating process.  Lost job, move to a new state, yadda, yadda, yadda, making a long story short.  So with all that said - back to my original statement. . . .  I have this roomate.  I have this roomate who originally was a good friend of mine who is pushing the envelope of the friendship.  We have been roommates for about a year now.  Just enough time to get to know the quirks of the friend/roommate and really let them get under your skin.  Hope you can relate to what I am saying.  My mother has been in the hospital, so I have been home in PA with my family.  She's fine now, but I have been gone for about a week.  Now I only had one real request when I moved into my buddies apartment.  Simply, "Don't touch my food.  I buy it for me to enjoy, no one else."  Now if I offer him some, that's one thing, but it's not an invitation to eat everything I buy.  As you may gues, - yes he eats me out of house & home.  So - back to the story.  I have been gone for a week.  I come home to NJ, tired, a bit frustrated, and stressed out from the previous few days.  I wanted a cocktail.  And I wanted a cocktail relaxing in my apartment.  I got home, put all my shit on the bed, went to the kitchen for a coke, and to the closet where I keep my booze, and guess what all my booze was gone.  A bottle of spiced rum I brought back from St. Thomas, and a bottle of expensive Khaluha that I receved as a gift.  Gone!  I was so pissed off I wanted to flip out.  I am Still pissed off.  So I pouted my way accross the apartment to the kitchen, opened the freezer to find all my chicken, steak, and pork chops gone!  This F'ing lazy MotherF'er - ate all my food!  Oh, and a bottle of my wine was also missing.  What the fuck went on for a week while I was gone?  It's a good thing this guy wasn't home when I got here.  I didn't know what to do.  So I went on Craigslist and started to look for new apartments. . . But then came to the realization that my roommate is moving out in a month and a half, so I think I can put up with it for 45 days.  Should I approach it.  He knows I'm low on cash, and that I am rebuilding my life.  What the fuck is he thinking - other than being a lazy bastard.  And, I truely believe he is just a lazy bastard at this point.  How does one approach the fucking drama (sorry for the F bomb so much - just very pissed off) without getting everyone pissed off.  What bullshit will he pull out of his ass as an excuse for drinking my booze and for eating my fucking food?  If it sounds petty - it may be, but right now in my life, every dollar counts.  Now I may not have enough food to get through until I get paid, which consequently could be two weeks away.  One of my closest friends and I HATE him for this stupid bullshit.   HATE HIM!  Need to make more money, need to live by myself again.  Much happier that way - no drama on the home front. . .

      For the shits &amp; giggles of it I am going to start the ball rolling with a DLR: "What I represent is attitude, point of view. What I represent is some sort of spiritual neighborhood. If you hate me then you hate your most favorite parts about yourself. Ozzy is the Prince of Darkness and Iâ€™m the Patron Saint of Larceny. Who would you rather be?"
