      there is a baby robin perched on a branch outside my window here at work. it is obvious that baby has not yet learned to fly. it's also obvious that baby had better figure out how, because it's a third-floor drop down to the ground. i have a feeling i'm going to be keeping an eye on baby bird all day.   update:  after some poking and prodding by mamma bird, baby bird is hopping and fluttering around all the branches, getting the hang of it. baby will be ok. yay!

      today, when the tampon machine in the office bathroom spit out my 25-cent tampon, it also accidentally spit back out my 25 cents, causing me to giggle with glee, because there's no "sold out" indicator, and that machine has stolen  so many  quarters from me in the past, i feel completely vindicated.

       say my name   i've always thought it was weird how radio stations make callers--those making a request or winning a contest or just chatting--say their call letters.  it goes something like this:  dj: what station gives you the best music  and  the most free concert tickets? caller: 98.5XYZ!!  and, i always think,  what if  the caller forgot the call letters? or said the call letters of a  different  station (entirely possible since clear channel owns everything and every corporate station is pretty much the same)? or said something entirely off the wall, like "free pancakes at the jiffy lube!"? what if?  i realize it's free advertising and name repetition equals recognition and all that, but to me, it always seemed threatening and somewhat sexual, like the dj should just scream "what's my name, bitch!?" instead of asking the corny leading question.

      some people are born naturals. watch people like the williams sisters, people like connor oberst, and you'll see what i mean. those people--those prodigies--they have a calling, and they found it, and they excel at it.  and finally, i have found my calling.  it's not going to change the world in large ways, nor is it going to make me rich, but i finally realized what i am here for, and that's carrying bags of groceries.  seriously.  i go to the grocery store, and i buy whatever i want. i don't worry about having to drag the cart out to my car and then back to the cart corral. i  know  i can handle as many bags as i can afford groceries to fill them. buying a case of beer and a gallon of milk, plus chips and toilet paper and a five-pound resealable bag of frozen chicken? not a problem.  take tonight, for example: i laughed in the face of seven bags--milk, bananas, pasta sauce, popsicles, and other heavy items included--and two boxes that arrived in the mail that day. and i did it all  with a free hand to open doors .  i'm thinking about quitting my regular drone gig and applying for a job at a grocery store. qualifications: well-equipped for carrying lots and lots of bags. and if the grocery store doesn't work out, i'd probably be the richest bag lady in america.

      my brother is getting married on saturday, and in this production, i get to play the maid of honor part, and accordingly, i'm feeling a wee harried.  lately i think of everything i do in terms of how it could possibly screw up the wedding. when i tripped earlier today, i could have fallen and broken my ankle, and then hobbled down the aisle, screwing up the entire procession, or even more frightening, had my foul cast forever marring the wedding pictures.  the pain in my stomach isn't a leftover manifestation of last night's post-game nachos bell grande--no, no, it's appendicitis, meaning i'll be hospitalized all weekend and there will be no maid of honor, no one to fix the bride's train or hold her flowers.  then  what?  and every car on the road during every commute is out to wreck my car, rendering me immobile and carless and without transportation to pennsylvania--and worse yet, depriving the procession of my seemingly fabulous car, which just  must  be used!  but hey, it's my big brother's wedding. it's a big deal, and all the work and fittings and phone calls and shopping trips and sheer panic are worth it.  and, when i'm completely off-my-ass wasted at the reception, i will slur to my disapproving relatives, "fuck you. i  earned  this shot of vodka. and this one. and this one. and this one..." and then i will grind to "celebrate" and cheer, because my big brother's getting married.

      tonight's a big one: the nhl season is over, but my new season begins.  the cool thing about this season is that the boy and i are on the same roster in the beginners' league (the boy has no business being in that league...but i pulled some strings and signed us a ringer) and we're rostered on  opposing  teams in the advanced league. this summer will be the best of both worlds...we get to play together one night a week, and then beat the crap out of each other in the other league.  i plan to shut him out. i really do. but, whenever i start thinking about shutting him out, i remember that time, long ago, before we were dating, when he scored  two  hat tricks on me in  one  game. that's six goals, kids. scary.  however, i have a weapon now that i didn't have back then, and that's the power to say: "score a lot now, and you won't be scoring much later, if you catch my drift..."  i think that will be an effective goaltending strategy.

      two things you should definitely, definitely not do while hungover:  1. try taking  urlLink this iq test . by question nine, i had to rest my head on my desk for several minutes, while breathing deeply through my nose and rubbing my belly. i even cried a little.  2. pretend you are a coyote-ugly barkeep and toss your freshly purchased powerade bottle in the air. you will not catch it; you will watch helplessly while the restorative orange tonic spills all over the office cafeteria tiles. people will stare, and the manager will have to get out the mop, and you will know he is considering sticking it up your butt.

      i realize that i have not posted much this week other than the occasional sentence, but i will ask your understanding; from monday to wednesday i logged almost forty hours at my desk, and that doesn't leave a whole lot of time for writing, it leaves just enough time to lay in bed for about a half hour and maybe read a book--and since i read all day long, reading is pretty much the last thing i want to do at night--before i get up and do it all over again the next day.  but i promised a recap of the wedding, so here, in abbreviated list fashion, are some highlights:  --we got into an accident on the way to pennsylvania. luckily, i choose to hit another volkswagen: tank on tank action, no damage, and small towns rule, because the woman i hit gave me a huge hug.  --the priest was totally fucking mean and fussy, he mentioned the bride's annulment during the actual ceremony and i wanted to get up out of the pew and slit his throat  --apparently, my brother has a favorite "hymn", which coming from a member of my super-non-religious family, is hilarious, and i almost burst out laughing during the ceremony  --the first two hours of the wedding day were spent performing an absolutely crucial task: watching the  jackass  movie with the bride  --i have never before in my life had  that many  bobby pins in my hair, or that much hair  lacquer  sprayed on my helmet  --most common things the best man said to me: "don't you think it's strange that we never dated?" and "it's a shame, because i really like your boyfriend"   --amount of shots taken at the wedding: unknown  --dancing with your dad is always the cutest thing ever  --people saying "you clean up nice!" constantly is not all that flattering  --i got food poisoning on the way back on sunday, and spent two hours throwing up, then some more on monday, while i was working ridiculous hours as mentioned above.  --i really only took that one picture, but there were photographers everywhere, like paparrazi, and as soon as i get some prints and cds, i'll post more and let you have a look, promise.  ok, i'm sure there's more but i can't think of them right now, and i should really get back to work, because tonight is date night and i really, really don't want to miss a single second of it.

      the wedding, oh the wedding. it was amazing and beautiful and harrowing and illegally fun, at times gut-wrenching and at other times heart-wrenching, meaningful and hilarious, and i shouldn't tell you this, but i broke the cardinal rule of shampoo solo, and there wasn't a whole lot of time for sleeping so i'm going to eat some cake and put myself down for bed, because all i want to do is just put on some warm pjs and lay on a bare chest and doze away. in the meantime, i took one photo during the entire weekend, late during the day on saturday as we were relaxing after the wedding but before the reception, and after i took it, i decided i wouldn't take any others, because there was no possible way i could replicate anything as cute as  urlLink this picture , which you must all look at immediately. that's all, for now.

      if your brother gets married, it is a requirement that you have your picture taken together, in front of the altar, after the ceremony. evidence of this requirement is  urlLink here . incidentally, yes, my brother is hot. it runs in the family. and while we are big, bulky, strong hockey players, the dress also contributes to making me look extraordinarily fat.  also, if your brother gets married, it is a requirement that you dance with your father at the reception, because, well, actually you always dance with your dad at weddings, he's got some moves. evidence of this requirement is  urlLink here . as a side note, my dad has two different color eyes: one blue and one green. when i was a kid i decided to nickname him "the husky." my brother got very cool hazel eyes from the mix; however, my mom's genes dominated and i got poo brown. fitting, though, as i am the poo.  during that very same dance, my mom decided she would cut in on my dad and me. and i took a picture of them. evidence  urlLink here . yes, i know...i look like her. a lot. sometimes, when she's not driving me completely crazy, i'm kind of pumped that i'll still be  that  hot when i'm fifty something. i'm going to bed, but first i will remind you that MILF comments are strictly forbidden. have at my dad, though.

      last night turned itself into an impromptu date night--interrupted, unfortunately, by another craptastic hockey game that led me to seriously entertain thoughts of quitting, until i was reminded that it is the first week of the season, and perhaps i'm being too hard on myself--that involved a visit to the neighborhood swimming pool (and i'm not lying when i say that i laughed uncontrollably for the entire hour we were in the water, because, for some reason,  everything  is funnier at the pool, especially slapping the surface of the water with that big red noodle) and later a cookout with steaks and zucchini and more noodles and a cd he wanted to hear, and then we sat outside, still damp, and talked about the coming weekend, making plans for fishing and boating and more swimming and cooking out.  and i caught myself in that moment and realized i was  happy , and more important, that the night was  exactly  how summer is supposed to be.

      i don't mean to make it sound all bad, because it's not, there are other moments lately when i'm so filled up with happiness and  safe  and warmth, but lately there's been a lot of despair. i spend so much time thinking i'm utterly fabulous, so the moments when i'm down, i'm  down . and it's one of those things i have to snap myself out of. i'm working on it.  there was good and bad in the weekend. i don't want to sell it short.  there were sweet little baby ducks and a hissing turtle and laying on a dock and butterscotch sundaes. there was and is the new harry potter. a pinnacle was reached. erotica was laughed at, and it was decided that i need a text-only (no dirty pictures) subscription to penthouse letters, just some cocks and cunts, no fancy stories, please. a promise was kept.  but there was also work hanging overhead. and i tried painting again, a painting of moths, and it's terrible and really hurt me a lot for some reason. and last night, i made my humiliating debut in the intermediate league, and to say that i am out of my league is an understatement. i belong in the beginners league. i've never been hit so hard before in my life; i'm going to stick with it for as long as the team will have me...i don't know how long that will be.  a lot of things added up; though none of it seems so bad now. the catalyst is mostly work, weeks on end of nothing but work have caught up to me.  i'm dealing by planning a vacation, in mid-july. i hope it happens, because i need an escape, i need a vacation, i need to feel alive again. and everyone knows how fucking much i  love  vegas.  but thank you for your kind words. i'll go back to being my normal fabulous self soon. pinky swear.

       meeting cameltoes   highlights from the most boringest meeting ever  --"doug, give her back the koosh ball  now  so we can continue."  --writing "i have awful gas" on doug's notes  --an accidental "bow bow...chick chicka" escaping my mouth  --battling cardboard minicoopers  ***  one of my roommates is away on a cruise for the next week. she took her boyfriend with her. this means that, whenever i want, i can walk around the house in my underwear.  of course i am taking full advantage of this.  however, constant underwear-only means i have gotten caught in front of the bathroom mirror on multiple occasions, giving myself extreme cameltoe and laughing myself silly.  the boy caught me doing this last night after our games, as i was brushing my teeth.  he was not amused, not at all.  ***  laying in bed later, i'm reading a trashy women's magazine, he's glancing over my shoulder. i'm looking at a feature where a reporter stopped couples on the street and asked what they would change about their partner.  "what would you change about me?" i ask him.   he knows this one. "i'd make you worry less," he answers. "you worry too much."  i nod. "i know, i do."  "what would you change about me?" he asks after i have turned the page.  i think about this. there really isn't much, to be honest. and then finally, it dawns on me: "i'd make you think my cameltoe is funny."

      sometimes i worry that the only reason i've gotten so far at my job, or lasted this long, is that i'm hot. not to mention that i offer tantalizing glimpses of my rack with skimpy shirts several times a week.  but then, then--on days like today--i hit the wide open man  all the way down the hall  with a projectile touchdown pass when i'm quarterbacking in corridor football, and i realize it's my athletic prowess, not my stunning good looks, that have gotten me this far.

      i am at home today, working from home and laying in bed a lot. last night my stomach was seized by cramps and i deposited the tuna sandwich i'd eaten several hours earlier in the toilet, bits and pieces out my nose, then crawled back to bed shivering and shaking.  today i am feeling a bit better.  aside from the "unfortunate incident" last night, the rest of the weekend was very nicely done, with a trip to a beer festival, a hat and sunglasses were worn to avoid the paparazzi, a first, darts, porn, french toast, a kitty sleeping outside in the sun,  urlLink a scary movie , a hockey game, showers, and sleep, lots of cozy, dreamy sleep.  now i need to rest.

      --my car inspection is overdue. by almost two weeks. can i wait to have it done until after i get back from vegas? i'm lazy.  --i almost had my first career shutout last night. blew it with three minutes left in the game. it felt good to win, though; it was also nice hearing "that was the best game i've ever seen you play" from the resident rinkrat/goaltending expert, too.  --my entire right upper arm is covered in a dark purple bruise. i should take a picture. i played five games the past three days; apparently, i took a lot of shots in the arm.  --a thunderstorm hovered over the rink and my house last night from 9 p.m. until 1 a.m. it was the longest, loudest, fiercest storm i've ever seen.  --i am probably going to get fired before i have a chance to decide what i want to do. which is fine.  -- urlLink the fabulist  might be the worst book ever, yet i can't stop reading it.  --  urlLink lxg   is getting awful reviews, so i might ask the boy to see   urlLink pirates of the caribbean   instead.  --i have a little post-it note in my pocket with one-word prompts on it. the prompts are for pirate jokes. the boy  hates  pirate jokes. this makes me like them more.  --i'm going to pawn my acoustic guitar this weekend. i have no musical talent, and i would rather have the $50 to spend on blackjack next week in vegas.  --i still can't believe i didn't win the damn lottery.  --it's late friday, and i can't wait to go home.

       crossroads   i started off having the best lunching meeting ever today, with a 65-year-old hustler with a knack for blackjack and the slightest hint of a boston accent--for some reason, i adore the way their Rs slip away.   i woke up this morning feeling really nervous; i'm not big on dressing up, having meetings, acting professionally. it's like at any moment, i  know  some sort of fart or boob joke is going to slip out and ruin everything. the boy, however, advised me to pretend like it was a  sports night  episode, which may have been the best advice ever--because the meeting went awesome.  we talked business, i wooed him with my fabulous idea, and he went for it. he may or may not have gone for it because i accidentally nudged his leg during much of the meeting, or because my boss piped in and offered him a chunk of cash.  regardless, it went so well that i designated Mr. Business Meeting my New Favorite Person; i actually had to excuse myself to the ladies room at one point so i could giggle uncontrollably for a few minutes.  but then i used my Corporate Card to pay The Bill, and we all parted ways, and everything went downhill on the drive back to the office, as my boss started in about how i'm "too quiet" in meetings, and how i need to step up and handle things more, and how very soon he needs me to take over his position as manager, and work on my "strategic thinking."  and i'm thinking,  oh, shit .  i don't want to do that, any of that.  so here i am at a crossroads, a forced crossroads. do i give up doing what i love--editing--to become a strategically thinking manager who makes a lot more money?  basically, the way i see it, it comes down to this: should i sell out?  i don't really have an answer yet. i know that being a manager was never part of my life plans; and i don't want to get forced or pushed into a career that isn't my dream, or at least closely approximating my dream. i don't want to look back in ten years and think, "shit, this isn't what i wanted to do  at all ." and i don't measure happiness and success by money.  i know that i have a lot to think about, and luckily i have a whole chunk of time to think about things next week. this might be one of those situations, though, where i already know the answer; i just have to get to know it better before i climb into bed with it.

      today, i am thinking a lot about the place where i live, and how it isn't anything like the place i'd  like  to live.  i want sparse and modern and functional and uncluttered and clean.  if you walked into my home now, you would see an attempt at that. the ikea furniture, flanked by dusty green carpeting, and covered in the debris that accompanies life: bills, books, laundry, photos, and 8,945 different tubes of chapstick.  does anyone actually achieve that ikea catalog crispness, does anyone actually live in apartments like the ones in movies, the huge open spaces and spotless floors and chrome tables? does anyone  actually  have a bulletin board in their kitchen with a deck of cards carefully tacked to it?  i don't have these answers, and frankly, i don't know what the hell i'm talking about today. i know that i've let things slip recently--it's as if, while i was working so much the past month, my possessions decided to take over, to take me hostage, and now  they're  in charge. and they've decided to sit everywhere, on top of everything, and get as dirty as possible, and i'm pretty sure they're snickering at me, too.  tonight, when i get home from work, i'm rearranging the furniture and cleaning and piling up a whole lot of things for goodwill. i'm reclaiming control. maybe it won't be exactly what i'd like it to be, but maybe it will be  closer . and i need that.

      i woke up from a nightmare--one of many i had last night--this morning at 7 a.m. i called to  urlLink indy , who was at the foot of my bed, to come up closer so i could pet her.  she wouldn't.  groggy, i squinted to see her a little better--normally she's not one to refuse some good lovin'--and noticed that her tongue was hanging out of her mouth. actually, pretty damn far out of her mouth. (please note that indy is a dog, not a cat, so tongue-hanging is rather unusual).  now, slightly worried, i sat up and noticed a thick line of drool extending from indy's tongue to my blankets.  drool mixed with blood.  and, in various patches around the bed, bloody drool stains.  and her two front paws, soaked with drool and blood. soaked, i noticed shortly thereafter, because every few minutes, she'd put a paw into her mouth, attempt to extract something, and mew miserably.  right about now is when i started panicking.  first, i consulted our usual vet, who didn't open until 10 a.m.--three hours away. mildly hysterical, i phoned the boy and, despite being well aware that he was sound asleep after a late night with his brother, demanded that his voicemail come to life and wake him up. then i contacted the parental support network, who expressed extreme dismay at the apparent illness and pain of one of their grandcats.  finally, after little other than sympathy from the parentals, the boy called with the number of a 24-hour emergency vet clinic just up the road.  cat carrier was produced, indy was loaded up, and off we went.  luckily, the whole vet process didn't take very long; at this point i couldn't take much more of witnessing my kitty in obvious pain.  the culprit: a broken molar that had to be sort-of extracted, but not really, because it was already most of the way falling out. apparently, the rest of her teeth are in bad shape--most likely because she was abandoned by her birth mom (and thus didn't receive teeth-strengthening nutrients, or something) and fed soft food at the shelter i rescued her from.  poor kitty.  all is ok now; she's got a week's worth of antibiotics to take and a shot at the vet. right now, she's curled up next to me, knocked out and seeming pretty much back to normal. she gets to be pampered for awhile, at least for a week or two in until the missing tooth spot heals, with special soft fancy food. i've been hanging at the house all day, just keeping an eye on things, in case the medications make her sick. so,  urlLink cait , if i don't make it to new pornographers tonight, that's why. i'm kittysitting.  after this, i'm wondering, do any of you pet owners in blogdom have pet/vet insurance? i see ads for it a lot, maybe it's something i should look into.

       risk   you could run away.  you could get lost.  you could choose someone else.  you could get angry and never speak to me again.  you could disappear and i'd never know where you went.  you could get mangled in a horrible accident.  you could get suddenly ill.  you could get tired.  you could stop loving me.   you could change.  you could get kidnapped.  you could leave.  you could die.  you could do anything, anything could happen, and so many of them would hurt.  fearlessness is a requirement to live; live fearlessly, love fearlessly, open our hearts and live and love, day by day never knowing what could or will happen in the future--being brave enough to open our hearts to the happiness of  right now  and pushing ahead, ignoring but acknowledging the dangers to ourselves, to our hearts, to those spaces we've filled up with you--only knowing that there are no guarantees, and that ultimately, everything ends.  i'm still learning to be fearless.

       this cat brought to you by rolling rock   by  urlLink indiana mousekowitz    ....mmmmmmurrrrrbbbbb...ppllllllluuuuubbbbbbb...bbbbbbbbbeehhhhllll.....  that's what it sounds like when i try to make noises.  maybe  urlLink reno  was lying about the whole buttraping thing, because i definitely don't think i got buttraped (though there was this little orange kitten named sport who i didn't like very much at all, he kicked litter at me!!) but i'm not even kidding around when i tell you this: i'm missing  four  of my fucking teeth!  i go to the vet, i'm short one tooth because of that time one fell out recently. but now i'm missing four more, and i don't know where they went! i'm serious when i say, what  the  fuck?!  it's a totally weird feeling, too, i keep putting my tongue in the spot where the teeth used to be--especially where one of my big fang teeth had been!--and there's nothing there. i can't stop doing it, i'm just lick-lick-licking and sticking my tongue out and there are no teeth! they're gone! fucking gone!!  anyway, shampoo keeps saying that i'll get used to it in a few days, but i don't know (it doesn't help that she keeps giggling at me when i stick my tongue in the empty tooth hole because my tongue hangs out the side of my mouth like i'm a leering lech; i  could  blame her for this, but i choose not to). what i'm most worried about, though, is that i won't be able to bite reno as hard i used to. that would be a serious problem, because i am eleven-time defending champion of cat-battle throwdowns. (reno cries like a girl.)  apparently, when i got home yesterday i wasn't acting like myself, shampoo says i was walking around like the really drunk girl at a party, the one who's always slurring "i love you guys" and hugging or headbutting everything and everyone. however, i seriously doubt this is true; this doesn't sound like how i would behave at all. perhaps shampoo has us confused;  she's  usually the silly drunk girl! ha!  anyway, i just thought i'd let all you weird internet people know that i'm at home and i'm doing better. (have i mentioned that i'm missing four fucking teeth?!) i have to get all this pain medication for a few days, and antibiotics for a week and to tell you the truth--i'm a little tired of shampoo sticking syringes down my throat. but it makes her feel needed, you know? and all your little comments were really flattering, i swear to ra.   however, i overheard shampoo say something about chipping in for my vet bills if you think i'm so great, but i'm not sure she's serious about that. she's always making fun of people who ask for money on their websites, so wouldn't that be a little hypocritical? yes, it would.  but, before she left for work this morning, she instructed me to find a corporate sponsor--someone to sponsor my vet bills, for real--and i'm thinking she isn't kidding on this one. i'm going to approach nike first; i could get free nike gear, some shoes and sweatbands and i  am  eleven-time defending champion of cat-battle throwdowns--talk about just doing it! or maybe i could get a sponsorship with a beer company, and get free beer all the time. we all know  that  would make shampoo happy!  so i better get going, thanks again. i've got some phone calls to make.

       how i tried to get out of going to the dentist/vet   by  urlLink indiana mousekowitz    i have to go to the dentist today. i found this a little upsetting when shampoo told me last night; i mean, she had just gone away on vacation, leaving me and reno with her vapid roommates all week, and now i had to go to the  dentist ? are you kidding me? i thought it was quite unfair, to say the least.  apparently, i have to go because of that time not too long ago when my tooth started falling out and  urlLink shampoo had to take me to the emergency vet  (that was fun! it was like the tv show! i liked all the attention!! everyone said how pretty i am!). so anyway, because of that, i had to have a teeth cleaning and some extractions, or something. i don't know what "extractions" means, exactly, but i'm not very good at math so if it's anything like subtraction, i'm in big trouble.  anyway, it didn't help when i overheard her on the phone talking about the anesthesia, and how she was worried it would make me sick or worse.  i don't know exactly what she meant by worse, but it didn't sound good. she seemed worried, which isn't necessarily uncommon, because let me tell you, i see her all the time, and shampoo worries more than any normal person ever should. it's ridiculous. one time, for about a week, she was all worried that the neighborhood kids were going to throw a baseball through the basement window, and that reno and i would run away through it. no lie. i mean, first of all, consider the odds, lady.  so  unlikely. not to mention, reno and i aren't going anywhere: we get more science diet, fresh water, pillows and toys than you can imagine. shit, no, we're sticking around.  anyway, back to my story. where was i? oh, yeah, the anesthesia. so that got me worried, and then it didn't help when  urlLink reno  started telling me stories about the time he had to go to the vet to get  his  teeth cleaned. apparently, when he was under this anesthesia, he got buttraped by a bunch of other cats. scary stuff, i'll tell you what. (however, i found out this morning, when shampoo woke up, that reno has  never  had his teeth cleaned. so he just made that all up to scare me. i swear to ra, that guy is such a jackass sometimes.)  but even though he's a jackass sometimes, he did help me last night. see, we overheard this message on the answering machine from the vet, telling shampoo not to feed me after midnight (which reminds me, what's a gremlin?). sure enough, she threw away all the food in our cat dish before she went to sleep.  well, we figured, if i ate something after midnight, i wouldn't have to go to the vet.  so, we faked shampoo out, laid on her feet for a little while, and when we were sure she was asleep, we went upstairs to the kitchen and kicked Operation Eat Something To Avoid The Vet into motion.  we started with the cans of soft food, but my teeth aren't that great (i need dental work, remember? pay attention, for chrissakes.) and reno couldn't figure out how to work the can opener.  urlLink the rats of nimh , we ain't, i know.  but then, while i was walking around on the kitchen counter, i found it: an unopened bag of pounce tartar control.  we spent the next three hours chewing the corners of the bag. when we got it open, i ate a few and reno ate about fifty, because he's a fat slob who will eat pretty much anything (popcorn, cereal, cheese, vomit--mine or his--dog food, celery). and then, as a finishing touch, we left the chewed-open bag right in the middle of the living room floor--shampoo would literally have to step on it the next morning when she went to take a shower!  the plan went perfectly. shampoo found the bag, took a shower, called us bad cats, and we could see that she wasn't sure what to do. she wanted to think that maybe it was just reno who had eaten the pounce--and i can't really blame her, because if there's someone who's going to misbehave, it's going to be him.  but then everything went terribly wrong: shampoo called the vet, explained what had happened and how she wasn't sure if i had eaten anything, and then she listened intently for a few minutes, and hung up.  at this point, i'd decided i was off the hook. reno and i high-fived and did some butt sniffing. his was not good; i'm certain mine was in its usual tidy-cats-fresh condition. after a few minutes of puttering around, though, shampoo pulled out  the cat carrier . the purple cat carrier, which is mine. reno's is blue.  and in i went.  and to the vet we went.  it only took a few minutes for me to figure out what happened once we got to the vet; they had told shampoo to bring me in anyway, and that they'd do the dental work later in the morning, in case i'd eaten anything.  shit fuck fuck  shit .  so, yeah, i'm at the vet now with a whole bunch of extra time on my hands, waiting for them to come clean my teeth and do this whole anesthesia thing. i'm a little nervous. i also heard something about implanting a microchip in my shoulder. huh? is this the fucking matrix? how do i get it through this girl's head that i'm not going anywhere? she seriously has no idea how damn comfortable her bed is.  however, maybe this microchip will make shampoo worry less, which i won't complain about. her pacing makes me nervous, and she can't pet me as well when her hands are all shaky.  even better, i don't see reno getting any kind of microchip put in  his  shoulder. now, you tell me, who does shampoo like better?   obviously.

       actual things spoken by members of my family today   "wow, there are  a lot  of shoes in here!"--my mother, after walking into a gigantic shoe outlet store  "ok, who wants to be handcuffed!?"--my 10-year-old nephew, screaming, after opening up some army toyset my dad bought him in a futile effort to get him to settle down  "holy shit, i can't believe he's going straight for the half-pipe!"--my dad, as we stood and watched my nephew try out his skills at a nearby vans skatepark.  we essentially spent the whole day there, where there are empty swimming pools and ramps and railings. i'm sure all these things have official names i don't know despite my love for all things x-games (they start august 16, yay!).  he fell a lot, which i expected. what i didn't expect was how he kept trying and falling and trying and falling. there's no way i would ride a skateboard into a 10-foot deep swimming pool. unless there was water in it. then, maybe.  there's an eight-year-old girl who hangs out at the skatepark who is an absolute prodigy. i've seen her there before and i was pretty excited when i saw her arrive today. i could watch this kid skate all day. in ten years, she'll be on the circuit or whatever it's called. seriously. i wish i had been that good at something other than masturbating when i was eight years old. the girl is my idol.  and, my nephew is totally in love.

      i have a lunch meeting today.  it's another one of those step-up-to-the-plate-and-be-a-manager meetings.  i historically do not do well in these meetings.  this morning, i thought that perhaps wearing new extra-skimpy underthings would help me feel more powerful and assertive in the meeting.  however, i now fear that i'm going to break into giggles throughout the meeting, because i can't stop thinking,  "there are YELLOW HUMPING MONKEYS all over my thong!"   i'm so screwed.

      look, i didn't want to tell you this, but i can't keep it a secret any longer.  last weekend, the boy and i did our usual friday-night-too-tired-from-thursday-night-to-do-anything-requiring-showers-and-clean-clothing trip to blockbuster. except, we went really, really late--close to 10 p.m.--and all the good movies were taken. we were actually looking for a sports movie (neither of us has ever seen   urlLink slap shot  , can you imagine?), but everything good was taken.  and, for the love of god, i don't know  why --but somehow, after a good 30 minutes in the store, we ended up in the kids' section.  and i'll admit it, it was my fault.  i pointed to the   urlLink air bud   tape and giggled, "we should get this!"  that's how it started. we rented  air bud .  i mean, it filled the requirements--it was, theoretically, a sports movie and a comedy, if unintentional. i haven't laughed that hard at a movie in a long time. ten minutes in, the dog's carrier, stuck in the middle of a road because its former mean owner has been careless, gets hit by a car.  hit by a freaking car.  and the dog just stands there and wags its tail,  wearing a clown costume .  approximate amount of time this scene was rewound: 16.  predictably, toward the end, the boy tosses the ball to the dog for him to make a basket, with all these people gathered watching, and the dog totally freezes and  takes it in the face .  approximate amount of time this scene was rewound: 57.  the worst part of the ball-in-face scene is that the dog winces before the kid even lobs the ball toward him, and you can tell the poor thing is thinking "pleasepleasejustletmeshoottheballintothebasketthistime iamsogoodatitiamairbudiamafreakingdogwhoplaysbasketball pleasepleasepleasepleaseletmemoveorgetoutofthewayifigethitintheheadwiththat fuckingballonemoretimeiamgonnagnawoffthatlittlebastard'sfaceiswear!"  (yes, i know that the dog had to have a leg amputated after the movie, and that sucks, but from what i understand, it wasn't related to the basketball playing or the ball-in-face scene; plus, that dog probably has more money than me...a dog with three legs has more money than me, so....he won't be getting my sympathy anytime soon.)  the best part, though, is that the fun won't end with  air bud .  apparently, it's a franchise.  and with a little luck, tonight i'll be watching   urlLink air bud: golden receiver  .  then it's on to   urlLink world pup ,  urlLink seventh-inning fetch  , and   urlLink spikes back  .  i won't be ashamed any longer.

       ways i could have just fired my assistant   "i'd like to say how good it's been working with you, but it really hasn't. clean out your desk."  "i can't stand your glasses. they're horribly out of style. and because of that, security will be escorting you out of the building now. don't attempt to come back."  "it really, really meant a lot to me that--even though you dicked over the company by only working here two months--you offered to stay an extra three weeks and do nothing but fuck off. seriously, it meant a lot. so much so that i'm firing you."  "you're really not attractive enough for me to sexually harass, so please leave."  "give me your security pass and get the fuck out of the building."  "goodnight, see you tomorrow...oh, wait, i won't--you're fired!"  "you're fucking fired, motherfucker."   how i actually did fire my assistant   "at this point, you're a liability and you're only encumbering my productivity. we'll mail your last check. give me your security pass."  i never fired anyone before. is it wrong that i thought it was fun?*    *the general consensus around the office is that i'm a bitch for doing this. a bitch! can you imagine?!

      i shaved the boy's head on sunday.  for the record, it was not my idea. i figure, i have the rest of my life to spend with a bald guy, whoever it may be, so i'm not real keen on hanging out with one now. but he's been talking about it off and on for awhile now, and ultimately, it's his head. hair grows back.  he went to a hair cuttery to get it done while i did the grocery shopping. he found me in the baking goods aisle, mostly shorn--but not completely.  apparently, he couldn't express "nearly bald" to the hairdresser, who could only manage broken english.  he was a disappointed boy, but he helped me unpack the groceries anyway.  "i could finish it for you, you know," i said finally, tomatoes in hand.  "really?" he asked.  i sent him out to the back deck with the cat, and joined them a few minutes later, trusty  urlLink remington bikini trimmer  and heinekins in hand. (yeah, i used my bikini trimmer on his head. whether this makes me a good or bad girlfriend, i'm not sure.)  the head was shaved; not completely, but as close as i could get it. i wish i had pictures; maybe tomorrow.  the best part, the part i don't remember at all, is that apparently, he asked what i thought when it was all finished.  i gave him a close look, and answered, "it will look good...when it grows back."

      shampoo is unhappy.  shampoo is miserable.  shampoo is sick and tired of doing the work of two editors. shampoo has been doing the job of two editors for more than four months; shampoo will continue having to do two editors job for another two to three months. shampoo's boss is also constantly on her case about taking on extra management responsibilities.   shampoo's boss is mean.  shampoo went away to a work conference this weekend, where day-long conference activities needed to be accomplished, as well as the work of the two editors back in the office.  shampoo's boss would call her hotel room constantly, and tell her to get back to the conference. (shampoo ordered expensive room service in retaliation, but  still .)  shampoo cried a lot yesterday.  shampoo got really sad last night, reading through some of the old things she'd written, about how she never writes anymore, because she's doing the work of two editors, and so she never has time to write.  shampoo is constantly exhausted these days.  shampoo is thinking about looking for a new job, a job where perhaps she would only have to do the work of one editor, minus the overbearing boss, if that's really possible anywhere.  shampoo has noticed that there are a lot more jobs in california than dc. shampoo is torn between her family and friends and the west coast. shampoo is also too broke to seriously move across the country.  shampoo is feeling guilty and missing some friends she had a falling out with.  shampoo is lonely.  shampoo doesn't know what the fuck she's doing.  shampoo can't work up the energy to write a half-decent post anymore. shampoo is in such a bad state, she is writing in the third person.  shampoo should be shot.

      i have a bunch of old-school photos i swiped from my parents ages and ages ago, with the intentions of doing photo retrospectives (idea blatantly stolen from the lovely and knocked-up  urlLink jenandtonic ), but then the photos sort of sat around for six months.  however! i have gotten off my ass and scanned a few, so i will be posting young shampoo photos off and on in the next few weeks or months, depending on laziness. bear with me, most have accompanying stories.  in scanning, i figured i'd start at the beginning. and, as far as i'm concerned, this is how i started:     when i was a few weeks old, my family was hit head-on by a drunk driver as they were taking me to visit my grandmother for the very first time. witness the car-carnage. my brother and our old dog, buttons, were in the backseat, they hit the window. my dad came out pretty much unscathed. my mom broke her nose and her collarbone. according to the local hospital, i was fine. i stayed with my grandmother while my mom recovered in the hospital for three days.  she came right to pick me up when she was released; my grandmother remarked about that i was an especially quiet and well-behaved baby. i was only a few weeks old, but my mom  knew  something was up. i was, apparently, not a well-behaved baby. she called my pediatrician.     my pediatrician immediately recognized what the hospital had overlooked: a fractured skull, the reason for my mom's broken collarbone. because this was before the time when carseats were mandated; she was just holding me in her arms, like moms do, and on impact, her collarbone and my skull pushed together and both cracked. you can see where they drained some fluid from my head in the above picture; i'm constantly touching my head in that spot to find the scar but i've never been able to. i'd probably have to shave my head to see it.  anyway, it (obviously) worked out ok. another day or so, and reportedly, i would have bit it. lucky my mom acted so quickly--though, in what's typical for my family, she really blamed herself for the whole ordeal, and became super overprotective of me, to this day. it must have been hard for her.  my family loves to tell this story at holiday dinners, and i always find it a little uncomfortable.  "you almost died!" "you scared your poor mother so much." "we almost lost you before we even had you."  it's all sort of sad. i'm here now, though, for whatever reason. when i was younger i thought it was because i had some grand purpose to accomplish, but i don't believe that anymore. it was just one freak thing that happened in a lifetime of freakish events. i've come to believe, though, that when i die, i'll die in a car accident: basically, because it seems like i  should  have died in this one, and i'm a big proponent of life going full-circle. i suppose i don't really have a say in the matter, but if you were going to make a movie about my life, kill me off in a car accident at the end. it will make me happy.     i ended up a happy baby after that, too. i started doing the things i love now back then, as you can see from the above picture. these include wearing wife-beaters and laying around on the floor in my underwear, as well as being mildly overweight and having the most stylish haircut in the world.

       is it two holes-in-one or two hole-in-ones?   last night's date night was sheer fabulousness.  it began with your protagonist and her love interest visiting the bestest curry place in all of northern virginia (cafe taj). we sat down for a nice dinner; the sweet host asked me where i'd been the past few months (busy at work) and then guessed--correctly--that we wanted butter chicken and daal and samosas. we each tried indian brews, split the bill, and brought home a ton of leftovers.  post-dinner, we mini-golfed. after shooting twos on the first three (par-three) holes and getting a hole-in-one on the fourth tee, i was accused of hustling. however, since we were the only ones on the entire course--what the hell do people do on thursday nights? sleep?--things got a little silly after the fifth or sixth hole.  new spins on mini golf involved hit-it-as-hard-as-i-can-into-the-water-and-splash-that-bird, as well as the ever-popular let's-tee-off-at-the-same-time-while-staring-at-each-other no-looking-down-and-whoever's-closest-wins. there was also a lot of jimmy-tapping with golf clubs, as well as skirt lifting with golf clubs, and the unforgettable riding-the-golf-club-like-it's-a-horse.  we eventually managed to get back on track, and i hit another hole-in-one on the 18th hole. two in one night has to be some kind of mini-golf record. however, it stinks to get a h-i-o on the last hole because you don't get your ball back. i threw the boy's ball into the water in retaliation.  post mini-golf, we returned to the chateau, where my roommate had been kind enough to tape the first episode of  temptation island  for us. oh dear lord. did anyone else see this? could that michael guy be more of a dork? did he really ask that girl, "do you want to see my abs?" i'm embarrassed to admit that when i wasn't laughing at that dork or screaming "why would anyone go on this show?!" i was hugging the boy and saying "i don't  want  you to go on dates with other girls!" and he would reply "it's ok, we're  not  on  temptation island . we're  smart ." i take television too much to heart; i am a writer's dream audience, though--i gasp when i'm supposed to, i laugh when i'm supposed to, i cry when i'm supposed to. my visceral reactions are the main reason i try to only watch television programs that involve a referee. i hate being played, but i'm such a sucker.  i've digressed.  after temptation island, there was  sportscenter  viewing and reading and curling up and sleeping. i woke up in the middle of the night to a raging thunderstorm--which normally would keep me up the rest of the night, as i am a wimp about storms--but instead i turned my back to the window, stole a spot on most of his pillow, and drifted back to sleep.  and, in the unlikely event that you're still reading and wondering what's up this weekend, i'm psyched for COLLEGE FOOTBALL KICKOFF DAY, of course. the return of sports that don't suck is a glorious thing.  p.s. someone really really  really  has to go to  urlLink tony hawk's boom boom huckjam  with me.

       i am a sport drink gastronome   on occasion, prior to hockey games, the boy will stop by the local grocery store and pick us up some sports drinks. i'm a powerade girl at heart, though i'll pretty much drink any sort of red thirst quencher.  however, lately the boy has adopted the habit of purchasing the grocery store discount brand, called winners.  winners is total crap. i've tried to convey this fact many times, to no avail.  recently, the boy pointed out that winners and gatorade, not to mention powerade, all taste exactly the same.  "not so," i replied tartly (as i am a tart). "my sports drink taste buds are so finely attuned, i can tell the difference between gatorade, winners,  and  powerade."  and with that statement, the  sports drink blind taste test  was born. pictures and results are below.     above you see our dedicated experimenter, formerly known as the boy, who actually at one point spoke, "we take these things very seriously at the sports drink institute; we've been around for...fourteen minutes now."     above is the test subject, carefully hidden behind a cat named reno. reno was supposed to help me in case i ran into trouble, as he has been known to dip his paws into misplaced glasses of water, milk, and gatorade/powerade.     the taste test table setup. from left to right, powerade (we actually drove to three different stores in search of red powerade), winners, gatorade, and a cup of water, which i was instructed to use "to cleanse the palate" after sipping each of the others. no joke.     the actual taste test; while i look ready to vomit, i assure you that it was laughter--no shampoos were harmed in the process of this experiment. i started off the test by smelling each of the drinks. the experimenter tried to coax me into telling him what i thought about each drink after trying it; however, i knew what he was up to--he was attempting to trick me into admitting that i  liked  winners. unfortunately, i said that it was "good" by accident. dammit.     the cat who was supposed to be assisting with the taste test eventually got bored and retreated to a high shelf to watch and meow plaintively. he was no help at all, and will not be asked back to assist with future experiments. also, we didn't give him the $25 we promised him if he helped.     the results: A was winners, B was powerade, C was gatorade. not only did i get this undeniably correct without a moment's hesitation, i got it correct on the smell test. here, i show winners what i think of it: you're crap, winners, CRAP!     the experimenter, dejected after his doomed experiment failed, and failed miserably. don't feel too bad for him, though--i gave him my phone number, a little what-for, and a place to spend the night.  my only regret was refusing to bet $20 on my taste buds' ability.   appendix :  shortly after the experimenter learned i planned to publish the above report, i received the following press release:   The Sports Drink Institute does not support this study; certain conditions existed within the experiment that likely contaminated the results. Therefore, we do not recognize this study as valid. Additionally, we think Shampoo is a doodieeeehead.

      --my team got eliminated from the playoffs last night; game two, must-win. it was probably the best game i've played all season: it was 3-3 and went into OT. three minutes in, i made the initial save--i shouldn't have--and then someone chipped in the rebound from an impossible angle. a defensive fault, not mine, but it keeps replaying over and over in my head.  --it's fall. the change seemed to happen suddenly over the weekend; now everything has a new crispness and the sunlight falls in a different slant. last night we slept with the windows open and i laid in his arms listening to a bullfrog in the yard and the sound of his breath steadying as he fell asleep. it's fall, and fall is my favorite.  --something good is coming; i feel it.

       nobody writes to the bloggers on weekends and holidays   and because of that, i'm going to finally answer the pressing questions  urlLink ms. styro  put to me at least a week ago as part of this strange internet interview phenonmenon that's been going around.  there is a list of rules and instructions one is theoretically supposed to post before answering, but i'm not going to bother, because i am quite possibly the last loser on the internet to participate and it's nine p.m. on friday night and i really need to get to blockbuster before the next air bud video is rented. just in case you're more lame than me (unlikely), basically, someone asks me five questions, i answer them, and if you want me to ask you five questions, you leave a message stating such desire in the comments. except, comments are currently down, so if you really really really want me to ask you questions and you want to go through all the trouble, you can  urlLink e-mail me  instead.  let's get this over with, then.    urlLink reno , colin farrell & your boyfriend are in a fire. who do you rescue first?   the answer here is blatantly obvious; no moral dilemma is created. i would, of course, grab reno. you will immediately assume that i am a horrible person, saving my cat instead of my darling boyfriend or the illustrious colin farrell. i will be doing myself a disservice by allowing both to perish, you say--with my boyfriend gone, who will i steal all my jokes from? who will keep me warm in the upcoming very-cold winter? and with colin farrell gone, who else will fake an american accent in a pitiful attempt at an imitation of brad pitt in cheap knockoffs of brad pitt movies? i assure you, i have considered both of these consequences, and i'm doing this for my boyfriend, as i have no doubt that if he was ever trapped in a room with colin farrell, he would not only be trapped, he would also be making out with colin farrell. and he'd die living his dream.   what was your all-time favorite halloween costume (yours or someone else's)?   i feel the same way about halloween that a lot of people feel about the  harry potter  books: for the love of god, it's for kids. unfortunately, i felt the same way about halloween as a kid as i do now. given my distaste, i can't say i had a particularly favorite costume--they all run together in one big blur of humiliation and motherly guilt, from the plastic raggedy-ann mask that gave me a rash at age four, to the flower-printed and sweat-stained sheet  that turned me into a ghost at age eight, and to the unforgettable gray tracksuit stuffed with couch cushions to make me hans (of the  saturday night live  skit hans and franz) at age 12 (good idea, mom, make a kid who's already religiously abstaining from self-confidence look  fat !), i don't particularly have a good costume memory of my own. one time, though, i reluctantly attended a halloween party sans costume (i put on a caps jersey and said i was a "hockey player") a group of girls showed up wearing tube tops and leather pants with vodka bottles in holsters around their waists. they spent the night playing coyote ugly and pouring alcohol down victims' throats. now that's the kind of costume i can get behind.   president bush sends you to the chair for being an enemy combatant. what's your last meal gonna be?   the real issue at hand is not the meal necessarily, it's why little bushy took so damn long to find me! i thought this country was turning into a police state! i thought johnny a. was taking away all of our civil liberties! i thought we were losing our freedom of speech! i expect to see faster action from dictators, and i've been a bad, bad girl for a long, long time. anyway, my last meal would most definitely have to be a warm serving of dick cheney's heart, sauteed in hollandaise sauce, served with a thinly sliced side of president bush's left nut garnished with red pepper. neither item is in high demand or heavy use, so procuring said meal request shouldn't be difficult.   tell me about your happiest memory.   july 4, 1988. my brother and i and the hnat twins from down the block are setting off fireworks on the street in front of our house. i'm 11, they're 15. we've just lit approximately seven snakes, nine spinners and three m80s  at once  in a feat of pyrotechnics that no group of four troublemakers has ever rivaled since. we're watching with glee, savoring the moment, the lights, the FIRE, until all three of the m80s change course and head directly toward our father's car, which he has, inexplicably, left parked in the street. in one instant, i glance at the car, the fireworks, and lastly turn to my brother, and say, very softly so the hnats can't hear, "i love you, mike" because i knew then, and i knew it completely, that we were dead fucking meat. my brother looked at me dumbfounded, burst out laughing, and then told me to shut up. we went to bed before dark the rest of the summer, but that was a great moment.   i hear that you're a transsexual hermaphrodite with a boob job. wanna talk about that?    and, this interview is over, as styro was very much warned that my operation was off limits.

       we choke our pets   in part two of the shampoo retrospective, i intend to completely ignore the fact that i promised some sort of chronological order. in fact, i lied, people lie, the world is bad, and that's that.  also, i don't think there will be as many photo retrospectives as i originally thought; looking through the photos, a lot are discolored, out of focus, and just not internet-ready. so there.     this round, we start with the front porch. that would be me and my big brother. on the front porch. it looks essentially the same now--still covered in the mini-golf fake grass carpeting, but those shrugs on the side are about four feet taller. also note my bulging belly. while i put this photo circa 1981, making me about four here, i was already rocking the beer gut and the slutty clothes. we start early in pennsylvania.     next. the same day, in the family backyard, which now has a pretty split-rail fence instead of that shoddy white-picket garbage. and that's our old dog, buttons, a miniature schnauzer who my brother appears to be choking in an attempt to get her to look at the camera. she was a really, really, really good dog, and technically  his  dog. she died suddenly of cancer in 1989, and ever since, my brother has kept her red collar in his nightstand drawer. i know this because i am a sister who snoops.     me and cotton in 1989. cotton was sort of a buttons replacement, but not really. my mom accidentally fell in love with her at a pet store one afternoon and brought her home; it was just a few weeks before buttons died. in retrospect, maybe my mom did that to soften the blow because she realized buttons was old, maybe she had a feeling what was coming.  anyway, it would also appear that i am choking cotton in this picture. i will say this: that dog  deserves  choking. i adore her (she's still alive and acting like a puppy at 15, living with my parents), but when she was a puppy, i wasn't too keen on her. puppies bite. a lot. so my cotton choke-hold was no doubt a preventive measure to keep her from gnawing off my fingers. she's much better now; whenever i visit my parents, the last thing i do before returning home is kneel down, give cotton a hug, and whisper, "don't die." it's worked so far, but sometimes i'm seized with panic when the phone rings, worrying that it's going to be my dad, telling me she died in her sleep.      this is a more recent picture of cotton, attacking a carrot. she is a bad ass. and that's really all i have for this installment.

      i took a zillion photos of last night's date night, and then i unloaded the photos to my laptop, and then i totally* left it at home, so the only picture i have access to is the one i immediately loaded on  urlLink shutterfly  to order a print of, so instead i'll just tell you that date night involved a ton of fried cheese, beer, a pickup attempt by a construction worker named dave who was wearing a big pecker t-shirt and who turned out to be from pennsylvania, and who we invited, along with his construction coworkers dave and john, to play us in darts. we totally lost. pennsylvania construction workers staying long-term in northern virginia are very open, about their salaries, their wives, their 10-month-olds, their mortgages, their daily food allocations, their love of red-headed sluts, and pretty much everything you'd ever want to know about their lives. so open, in fact, that you'll totally find yourself wishing they would shut the hell up already and also hoping that the target they are helping to build is finished right quick, so that you can return again to your favorite bar without fear of running into them.  since i don't have photos, i give you quote highlights:  "it's not an angry homophobic dmx bear...it's more of a sweet hilary duff bear."  *  "but...i don't  want  you to disappear for a year and then turn up dead!" "this is a totally hypothetical situation." "i hate this hypothetical situation!"  *  "i always know to wear my cup when i'm playing against (shampoo's) team! she gets me right in the nuts, every time!"  *  "you guys married?" (heads shake vehemently no) "have any kids?" (glances exchanged) "well...not  together ."  maybe i'll add the photos when i have a chance, tonight, or this weekend, but i totally wouldn't count on it if i were you.  and i totally wasn't going to link to  urlLink this picture , because, come on, how completely tired are you of seeing my mug and my gushing about the boy and hearing about how damn cute he is? you must totally want to puke, and yet, i can't resist. puke! and if you aren't tired of that yet, you are totally tired of hearing about my guns, which someone is no doubt going to comment on below. go ahead, do it. i dare you.    *the first person to correctly count the number of times "totally" appears in this post will one day receive a very special handmade by shampoo present in the mail. with heavy emphasis on the "one day" part.

       bite me   last night, the boy and i decided to purchase harnesses for the cats, to take them out in the backyard to play in the grass and sunny weather. this, as you might guess, was an ill-advised decision from the start; there was a lot of fleeing the leash and harness, a lot of jumping at the door to get back inside, but mostly, a lot of flopping over on the ground and simply refusing to budge.  defeated, humans and felines returned indoors, where i began to notice a number of mosquito bites around my ankles. as we sat and read, i noticed more bites, on my calves. then up my thighs. then on my stomach, arms, and back.  panicked, i began searching the room for the mosquito, which by now i realized had accompanied me indoors. i finally located it on the wall next to the bed, and the boy smashed it with his open hand.  blood smears all over the wall. the ensuing conversation went something like this:  me: oh my god, did it bite you? boy: um, no. i killed it. me: but you're bleeding like crazy! boy: no...that's your blood. from inside the mosquito. me: (dumbfounded) wow...that's.....disgusting... boy: (glancing at the mangled mosquito on his ring finger) yeah. me: you should probably go wash your hands.  to summarize, mosquitos are nasty, disgusting creatures. also, i have somewhat sensitive skin that reacts very, very poorly to mosquito bites. by a poor reaction, i mean that the area surrounding the bite swells up to about three times normal size.  so, today, i have a total of  twenty-three  mosquito bites all over my body (yes, even one on my rack, if you must know). mosquito bites approximately the size and roundness of coke cans.  the moral of this post: i am very fucking itchy today.

       i hope nhl players cry, too   game three of the playoffs last night. series tied 1-1. a must-win for both teams. tight game the whole way.  regulation ends in a 6-6 tie.  game goes to a five-minute overtime.  overtime ends, still 6-6.  game goes to a shootout situation. four shooters each side. one-on-one with the goalie. i.e., a shooter with a breakaway, no defense, just me.  my team goes first. no goal.  me and the first skater next. he goes wide, stick side, and i poke check the puck away from him, going down on my ride side and cutting open my elbow on the knob of my stick. smarts. i ignore it.  my team's next skater goes. no goal.  my turn. next guy pulls the same move, wide stick save, i poke check again, fall on the elbow again. ouch.  my team's next skater goes. no goal.  me and the next skater. this guy can't even skate, so i'm confident, i butterfly, make the save with my left pad and hear someone yell "oh, great save!" from the bench, and then watch as the puck bounces off my pad and into the goal.  we're down one, with one skater on each side left.  our last skater goes, dekes the goalie, and lays in a sweet wrister.  we're tied again. 1-1.  and it's just the last skater and me. no pressure, nothing on the line, just potentially the end of the season.  he skates in, dekes, and goes high glove. i'm too slow. i let it by.   game over.   and i won't lie, i cried. i skated right to the locker room while my team faked the end-of-series handshake. i took off my jersey, buried my head in it, and let the big ugly sobs come until i heard the locker room door open and the team come in. i pulled it together as best i could, to take off my gear and go home, where i lay on the gravel driveway and cried some more, while the boy told me other gruesome OT shootout stories.  you can say whatever you want here. it's a team effort. there could have been better defense in regulation. more goals. a goal in the OT. more goals for our side in the shootout. there are plenty of ifs.  but, ultimately, what it comes down to, is failure. i failed. i choked. i lost the game. i got us eliminated. this is the reverse side of the glorious feeling of winning and advancing...the feeling of despair and just plain failure. i failed.  that's all there is to it, and i remember it every time i stretch out my arm and my elbow whines in discomfort, i  failed , and it's hard to take.

       rock you like a...regular windy night   i made it through the hurricane just fine. it wasn't that bad where i am; mostly just wind and rain, and a little bit of green lightning, but that was about it. the power flickered three times, during  temptation island , annoyingly enough, but that was about it--the satellite didn't even go out, and i stood in line at blockbuster for an  hour  renting five movies just in case. of course, when i got up for work this morning, there was no water--and it's not supposed to return for 48 to 72 hours--so i'm feeling a little stinky. i saw a ton of broken trees and debris and such on my way into the office, but overall this area didn't seem to get hit too hard.  i'm one of only four people who could "make it" into work, though.  i'll be leaving shortly. i really hope the malls are open. yesterday the boy and i went to best buy to look for the new mates of state cd around 5:30 p.m., and the moment we walked into the store, the power went out and we got thrown out of the store (probably because i yelled "grab whatever you can, loot, quick!"). hurricanes make me want to shop!  i don't feel very clever or witty today, just tired and wound up and altogether distracted, but,  but  i have some good news coming. on monday. see you then.  love, the poo

       temporary insanity  or  proof that i am definitely going to hell   i did something awful this morning.  so awful that i very, very much considered not writing about it publicly, because i'm honestly ashamed and embarrassed of my behavior. sort of.  i have a roommate who is very inconsiderate. she is a personal trainer and much too involved in fitness; she is currently participating in some strange body-improvement challenge that requires her to eat at least 36 eggs per week. for breakfast.  as i'm sure i've complained about previously, my bedroom is directly below the kitchen. i hear every movement in the kitchen upstairs, and i am generally more than patient about it.  i've asked this roommate, repeatedly, to please please please please be soft for me in the mornings. she is either very stupid or very inconsiderate, because she wakes me up every morning between 5:30 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. regardless, stomping around the kitchen, banging the chairs, slamming dishes, pounding the dishwasher shut, etc., etc., as she makes her eggs, turkey bacon, and oatmeal.  every  morning.  this morning, she entered the kitchen at approximately 5 a.m. and cooked for the next two hours, as the boy and i kept fitfully waking and dozing off again.  two hours.  two hours. seriously.  when i heard her finally finish in the kitchen and go upstairs to her bedroom, something inside me snapped. i gave up on asking nicely.  i threw the covers off and padded upstairs to the kitchen, thinking about how much i would like to hurt her, and saw her gallon can of oatmeal sitting on the kitchen counter.  i didn't think twice.  i opened it, collected all the foul morning-breath reeking saliva from my mouth, and chucked it into her oatmeal.  a good shake, and she'll never know.  ok, i  know . i'm evil.  i'll get home before her tonight and i'll "accidentally" spill it, throw it away, and get her more (even though  urlLink rob  thinks i should let her eat one bowl). i will then ask her, again, politely and maturely, to please try to keep the motherfucking noise down in the kitchen in the morning.

      in all the fuss over the new job, i'd almost completely forgotten that i signed up to take an introductory screenwriting class. it started last night.  as far as screenwriting goes, i have zero experience and some interest. i'm mainly just curious, and it seems like the class will be pretty interesting. at least, the instructor seems interesting and knowledgeable (though i completely disagree with some of the things she said, most notably that "people  never  change"; i think i may have sniggered when she said that)--though several of my fellow students seem a bit too talkative, including one who rambled on and on about how her kids make fun of her for writing. if i could have put a voiceover on that scene, i would have quipped, "lady, this isn't therapy. shut  up ."  the class is going to be a decent amount of work, writing a scene every week (that should be the easy part) and seeing a number of movies every week, at least one rental and one in theatres. this would be fine if the instructor just encouraged us to see any movie at all, just so we were watching, but she wants us to see very specific things:   urlLink the secret lives of dentists ,  urlLink tape ,  urlLink catch me if you can  , and   urlLink in praise of love  . that is just a wee bit much; luckily i've seen two of those movies already, but i doubt i'll be so fortunate in the future--the odds of my slacking off are very, very good.  also, at the end of class each week, the instructor will hand out scene guides and select two people from the class who then have five minutes to block the scene and create some dialogue, in order to convey some "mission" to the class. and oh, i knew immediately, from the gleam in her eye, that she was going to pick me. and she did, along with a swedish boy named tobias. it was...interesting, and the worst part is that participating in it once doesn't exempt you from doing it again--plus, each week people can cast class members to act out scenes that they've written, though that might be a little easier, having the dialogue to work with already. anyway, it went sort of like this (keep in mind that we had five minutes, so the bulk of dialogue was ad-libbed and what's below isn't an exact replica by any means):  INT.OFFICE.DAY.  MR. ANDERSON and ALICE, his secretary, arrive at their office doorway simultaneously.  ALICE good morning, mr. anderson.  MR. ANDERSON good morning. did you enjoy the rest of your weekend?  ALICE (settling in at her desk) well...yes, yes i did. sir, i -  MR. ANDERSON could you get me some coffee, please, alice?  ALICE yes, sir, of course.  alice crosses the office to prepare a cup of coffee, glancing back nervously over her shoulder as she stirs. she hands him the coffee, fidgeting nervously beside his desk.  ALICE look, mr. anderson, about saturday night, i, um, i, i--  MR. ANDERSON alice, please, it's completely forgotten. we all have our momentary lapses of judgment.  mr. anderson watches as alice nods, still embarrassed.  MR. ANDERSON (continuing) besides, my wife didn't suspect a thing.  FADE OUT:  THE END  yeah, pretty silly, right? that's what i thought. at least i was able to easily translate my natural nervousness (acting is yucky!) to the nervousness of my character. and the class seemed to get our "mission"...did you?

       for j.p.f., who will never read this   imagine arriving yesterday for a last weekend of vacation, before the weather starts changing, before the water gets too cold.  imagine setting up your blanket and umbrella on the sand; imagine rubbing spf 45 across both your arms and face--even if it's late september, you'll still burn. you both always did.  imagine kissing his nose.  imagine playing in the surf together, laughing and chasing each other, still full of the bliss of newlyweds, even if it's been longer than the usual year. it always seemed longer with you.  imagine raising your head up off the blanket when you hear the noise from the water. he raises his head from your arm, where he's been napping.  imagine hearing him say, "i'm going in."  imagine trying to stop him: "we're on vacation. don't."  imagine wishing he'd look back one last time as he swims out. he's a firefighter. he's done this danger before, so have you.  imagine standing on the shore, watching.  imagine meeting the youngest one after he's dragged her to the surf, and wrapping a towel around her.  imagine watching him go out again.  imagine watching and watching. and he doesn't come back. not for minutes. and more minutes. and then, hours.  imagine waiting alone, on the shore, shivering. the sun sets. people have crowded around. you're on vacation. you're hours away from home. you brush away offers to be taken to the hotel, to the hospital, to the ambulance.  imagine refusing, imagine being stubborn, imagine insisting. he will come back.  imagine, then, when he does come back, on a coast guard stretcher, that he looks asleep and calm and they must be wrong,  this can't be .  imagine returning to the hotel room and gathering his things. the things he packed for this weekend, a romantic weekend with you.  now he's gone. and you're alone. abruptly, unkindly, suddenly, without a warning, without a goodbye.  i can't even imagine.

      i have nothing much to say lately, because things have been going wrong left and right for the past few days, including:  --a serious miscommunication  --the death of a family friend, recently married, who swam out into the ocean to rescue a drowning child, and drowned himself  --the discovery of a number of mysterious lumps, to be investigated later today  --my parents seriously considering putting  urlLink cotton  to sleep  --the proliferation of vague symptoms that suggest i may have inherited a debilitating family disease  --an act of petty and hurtful immaturity   --penn state lost  again   i have a lot on my mind and that makes it hard to write. sorry.   update : the lumps, at least, are nothing to worry about. whew. maybe i can get some sleep now.

       i knew raoul bova was trouble   sunday morning, 9:15 a.m. the boy and i begin imitating raoul bova's flop-on-the-bed routine from the previously mentioned gap ad.  sunday morning, 9:30 a.m. the boy and i are on our way to the emergency room after i, unsuccessfully, tried to grab his jeans pocket in mid-flop. i missed the pocket and instead took heel to lower chin. i can't close my mouth and we know immediately there's some jaw issue. i cry a little, but mostly i laugh at the utter ridiculousness of the situation, though both cause extreme pain and it's best if i not talk and show no facial expression.  sunday, 10:30 a.m., 11:17 a.m., 2:34 p.m. we are humiliated by "how did this happen" inquiries and further questioning along the lines of "was this domestic violence?"  sunday, 3:30 p.m. we emerge from the hospital with a diagnosis of "almost but not quite dislocated", follow-ups scheduled with oral surgeons, prescriptions for painkillers and steroids, xrays,  and instructions to eat only a liquid/soft diet for two weeks.  sunday, 3:45 p.m. i cry while attempting to eat mashed potatoes.   how's your weekend been?

      one of the huge bonuses of working for a Large Company: sweet employee-only gym facilities with state-of-the-art equipment and posh locker-room facilities.   one of the huge negatives of working for a Large Company: stepping out of a hot shower post-workout, still red-faced and huffing but thinking 'this is a Large Company, i don't know anyone here!' and then noticing that one of your bosses is standing right in front of you, staring at you, and you're naked, and you wonder exactly how you're going to get any work-related answers from her ever again, now that she's seen the massive stretch marks on your ass and how you wrote "BUY SOAP" on your stomach three days ago with a thick black sharpie and it hasn't washed off yet. and have i mentioned the part about being naked?

      that's right, motherfuckers, i'm back.  ***  i stopped writing for three reasons:  1. i started a new job and i thought i needed a breaking-in period to concentrate fully on work, no bloggy blogs, just behaving myself.  2. i wanted to concentrate my writing on some other ideas i had.  3. i got overwhelmed by a barrage of hatred, including some slander on other websites and the occassional pissed-off e-mail.  however, over the past two months-ish, several things happened corresponding with my three reasons for stopping:  1. i noticed an excruciatingly large number of very, very funny things happening in my new day-to-day life, and it really bugged me that i had nowhere to share them. plus, i settled in pretty quickly at the new job, and while it's demanding and difficult, it's also fun and interesting and i pretty much adore it. for you, this means: funny work stories!  2. i didn't work on the other writing ideas i had, because i was too busy working. this meant that i stopped writing almost completely. and that sucked. for you, this means: i'm back!  3. i started getting really bothered that i had let certain people's negative opinions of me, my writing, and the life that i choose to live stop me from doing something that i, for the most part, really enjoy. in one long talk on this subject with the boy, he pointed out that i shouldn't let other people control what i do, whether they love me or hate me. very good point, boy. for you, this means: if you like this place, great! thanks for coming by! if you hate this place, and by association, you hate me: FUCK OFF!  and with that, i have returned.

       things i forgot to mention   1. remember  ghostbusters ? it was the "stay-puffed" marshmellow man. not the state-puffed marshmellow man as i thought. the discovery blew my mind.  2. i am moving into a brand-new place on saturday; no more loud roommates, no more stomping in the kitchen above my head, no more living in a basement. we're talking top-floor apartment, cathedral ceilings, a fireplace, a walk-in closet, my own bathroom, the works. i couldn't be more excited. or busy.  3. as of saturday, i will have high-speed internet at home. bye-bye dialup! more important, i will also have wireless high-speed internet. i can't wait to sit on the toilet and update this site. life is going to be real, real good.  4. it's supposed to snow on saturday. moving + snow + 26-foot uhaul = disaster.  5. wish me luck.

       snob doctor   driving to work this morning, i was behind a black toyota four-runner. i wasn't particularly paying attention, but eventually i took notice of the license plate:  SNOBDR  "snob doctor?!" i think to myself. "what an asshole! what a complete jerk...i mean, i realize doctors are pretty snobby in general, 'oh, i went to med school, look at me!' or does this doctor only administer to rich people? so he'll only take rich patients...what does that say about the state of insurance, if, if--"  right about then i noticed the extreme sports sticker on the back left windshield.  and then i realize it means snowboarder. not snob doctor.  honest mistake.

       please read only if you really care what color my bathroom towels are   i have some pictures; just a few as we are still somewhat incomplete. the living room is not finished. it will, however, in approximately a month, be comprised of  urlLink this chair , in red, with  urlLink this couch , in the blue that's shown with red pillows, and a 36-inch flat screen tv. however, that stuff comes next month, once i finish all the stuff i got this month.  let's start with the  urlLink bedroom . it's dark already, so the pictures aren't great and i couldn't get a good shot of the window or the view. the comforter is the same i've had for awhile, but i love it. as you may guess, i like colors. props to the boy for assembling both those night stands. i wanted something with drawers to hide most of what, on moving day, was tucked away and hidden in the "sinbox." oh, you  wish  you knew.  the cats are having a hard time adjusting to the move. they spend most of their time in  urlLink the walk-in closet  for some reason. i imagine they feel safe because it is so tiny. or, maybe they're just waiting near their carriers until it's time to go home. i'm hoping in a week or so they'll adjust and come out of there more than to eat and poop.  next,  urlLink the bathroom . like i said, i like colors. i'm not sure how much this works, but i love the shower curtain. it is colorful, indeed.  perhaps the most boring image of them all,  urlLink the kitchen . not really much to see. except the kick-ass chrome wine rack and the colorful knife block. yes, colors.  next,  urlLink the mantle . yeah, those are stocking hung by the chimney with care. and a tree. and you can see the red lights i strung out on the balcony when i got home from work earlier tonight. i froze my ass off. the mirror is awesome, but the boy can't stand that weird bird/fish thing. it works, though, i swear; or at least it will once we have a blue couch and a red chair. remember, people,  colors .  and the best part of the whole place, la creme de la creme, is  urlLink the dining room . i have a feeling  urlLink a fellow red lover  will especially like this. that's my grandmother's 1960s kitchen table, and four bastardly chairs i assembled on saturday night. it seems that i have a habit of talking trash while putting together furniture. a lot of "yeah, what's up now, bitch?"  that's all for now. perhaps more when the camera battery recharges.

       good things about moving in the snow   there are none.   no, really, there aren't.   but, the move is mostly done. all the furniture and belongings and cats are in the new place. all the new ikea furniture is slowly being assembled. there will be another ikea trip, with truck, next weekend -- and then we'll have a couch.   i'm not sure how to express how much i love the new place. i've lived in a basement for six years. and now i'm on the top floor. i have a view. in the old place, i had five lamps in my bedroom; i've narrowed that down to two because the room is so bright. i have more closet space than i can fill.   i have a rainbow-colored shower curtain, a blue rug, some green towels and some yellow towels. i have a bright-colored duvet with not one but two night tables, complete with drawer and shelves for books. i have an entry way. i have a washer and a dryer. i have a vintage 1950s kitchen table that my grandmother gave me, with chrome legs and a black and white speckled top, and yesterday i spent an hour assembled four red chairs to go with it. i have a breakfast bar and a spice rack and a chrome dish rack and a chrome wine rack and a fridge and a freezer and everything is clean and neat. as of next weekend, i will have a bright red chair and a turquoise couch and a red polka-dotted lamp. someday soon i will post pictures.  i am excited, and happy, and about to run to target for a few essentials, like a trash can and a can opener, and then i'm going to help the boy (who deserves a majorly huge 'thank you' for all his help, all weekend long, from carrying heavy boxes to asking the cable guy to wipe his feet to installing a firewall [oh, yeah, i have wireless high-speed internet now!] to paying for pizza) hang a pan rack, and then i think i'll relax.  moving, despite the snow and the cold and the ice, is definitely kick ass.

       things the boy and the poo have done today   --attended a two-hour, painfully uncomfortable dentist appointment involving extensive drilling, choking pink goo to make molds, and plenty of gagging. oh, and a near $1,000 bill. cha-ching! (her only)  --thought about hot dogs (surprisingly, both).  --discussed the cute commercial with the hot dog girl.  --argued over whether or not it's really jack white in that electric six song. (he says it's not, she says it is.)  --considered plastic surgery (him).  --played online blackjack for approximately one hour (her). watched (him).  --donated a sack of clothes to goodwill (him; the clothes were hers).  --visited the homes of several strange men (both).  --saw 'the return of the king', mutually agreed that we liked the second one the best and this one was  kind  of a letdown. oh, and viggo doesn't do it for us (her) anymore. also, intentionally went to the bathroom during the big scary spider part, because spiders are  already  big and scary enough, and was upset to learn that the big spider part wasn't  really  over yet (her).  --decided that the newest death cab for cutie cd really is pretty good, after disliking it for many months. the sudden turnaround has  nothing  to do what seth on  the oc  thinks of it. (her.)  --wished  the oc  was on tonight (definitely her).  --wondered what ben gibbard looks like shirtless (her: pale, skinny, hairless; him: hot white chocolate).  --reiterated that  adaptation  is a shit-tastic movie, yet watched it anyway.  --insisted that college basketball sucks until march madness (her) and completely disagreed (him).  --suggested that opening the christmas presents tonight was a good idea (her) and completely disagreed (him).  --screamed "FUCK" very very loud for no real reason (him), startling someone (her).  --attempted to retrieve beer from fridge using mental levitation skills only to fail again (him). laughed at, not with (her).  --grabbed the other's boobs (her).  --willingly followed barked instructions such as "go get the laptop power cord!" and "get me a beer!" and "you forgot the coozy!" (him).   --considered getting up to plug in the christmas tree (both); didn't (both).  --proudly showed off samples of work that will be published tomorrow (her), sarcastically said, "you really  love  your job" (him).  - stopped with this goddammed two-hyphen indentation crap (him); gave him a dirty look for referring to her writing as "crap" (her).  - attempted to hide boner (unsuccessfully) (him).  --complained that, 'i never write anything on my website....please help me." (her.)  --helped her (him).  --realized that it was getting close to 10 p.m. and there was probably a bar to go to instead of screwing around on the internet for hours and hours (both).

       observations from my morning commute   1. patriotic/flag stickers are  over . people of america, e-fucking-nough. give it up already.  2. initial stickers. for the love of christ, i don't give a shit if you vacation on hatteras island or in nova scotia; the truth is, unless my hood is lodged entirely in your trunk, i can't tell what the fuck the initials on your sticker stand for. case in point: this morning, i was behind a minivan with an LV sticker. i figure that's for las vegas; upon closer inspection (i.e., a near rear-ending), i see that it's really for  latvia . come on. no one is impressed.  3. people who don't tailgate. newsflash: when you're only moving 10 m.p.h., there's no need to leave two cars lengths between you and the vehicle in front of you, there's not even a need to leave a half car length. see, if you creep up on that car in front of you, the car behind you can creep up on you, and so on and so on, and everyone can get a little bit closer to where they're going in a little less time. of course, i haven't done any research into the physics of this statement, so perhaps, as an even better idea, you can all just get the fuck out of my way.  4. people who give me dirty looks for putting on make-up in the car. yeah, you. i've seen you a thousand times, talking on your cell phone in traffic and not bothering to use a signal when you swerve into another lane; don't shake your head in disapproval at me because i'm applying mascara while stopped at a traffic light.  5. suvs:  urlLink you know how i feel about you . more specifically,  urlLink fu, h2 .

       poo, on christmas   so, it turns out, the cold i've been complaining about for the past week or so, maybe it started as a cold earlier in the week but at some point in time it shifted into something more, until i slept zero hours on christmas eve because of all the hacking and spitting and the ever-present feeling that i was drowning in my own lungs.  christmas morning, instead of driving up to give and receive presents with my family in pennsylvania, instead of having a huge italian-style stuffed shells/lasagna/wine and meatballs/pepperoni extravaganza, complete with annoying banter and moments when i wanted to annihilate my mother's very existence, instead of that, the boy and i waited patiently for an urgent care center to open, and then waited for two hours to see a doctor.  around 2 p.m., the doctor officially declared that i had acute bronchitis, wrote me out prescriptions for antibiotics and some kind of codeine-laced cough syrup (which, if i swallow one teaspoon of, i can function like now in a sort-of woozy way, but if i take two teaspoons, i turn into some kind of david foster wallace prodigy girl, everything running through my head in the format of a clever footnote and i can't remember any of what i was thinking when the codeine wears off four hours later).  so now i'm propped up on the couch, in the company of cats, just cats, missing my family and wondering, i mean really  really  wondering, what i got for christmas, and also wondering how pathetic it is that i'm sort of excited for this  world idols  show at eight, but ultimately, i'm not sure how much more pathetic it can get. so, no matter how annoying your family is being, no matter how much you wish you hadn't eaten all that pie, and no matter how much you wanted _____ instead of _________, it's not all that bad. you could be drugged up, lonely, and trying to download the original summer season episodes of  the oc  from soulseek.  there's no way i can write all this and not sound all 'oh, poor me' and i apologize for that. it's not my intent to curry sympathy, but let's face it - this sucks. i know nobody wants to be in this position, i know nobody would wish this on anyone (well, maybe some people would). so yeah, it sucks, and i know it. i'm ok with it, though. for me, christmas will come a few days later, probably on saturday or sunday, when i'm feeling a little better, my parents will drive down from pennsylvania bearing all the gifts that are still sitting under the tree  unopened  (the poor gifts!) and with luck, they'll also bring some leftover italian feasties and leftover mom's home-made cookies and we'll pretend it's christmas. or something.  so yeah, i'm ok with this.  except for the hacking and the spitting and that drowning in lung-sludge feeling. but i have codeine for that.  on the bright side, i've only been able to exchange gifts with one person so far, and that's the boy, and just based on that one exchange, which made me cry because it was so sweet and thoughtful, it was one of those things that you always want to get for yourself but you never do because it's too extravagant, and you don't even know anyone knows you want it, but you mentioned it in passing once and he tucked it away in his memory and that's what was all wrapped up under the tree all this time, well, that in and of itself means this isn't so bad, and makes for one damn good holiday.  p.s. the boy gave me a subscription to   urlLink mcsweeneys  , back issues eight and eleven, and this weird thing, i don't know what it's called, that embosses "property of ________ ________" on the pages of books or any kind of pages. i told you it was awesome. and why the hell is jc chavez on  the osbournes ?

      i had the best-laid plans for the week before christmas. i was going to bake cookies from scratch to mail out and to give away as gifts. i was going to handpick songs for a mix cd, then design some snazzy liner notes along with some snarky title, then write a snappy quiz in order to give it away. i was going to handmake bright-colored mirrored picture frames for my coworkers. i was going to plug in the christmas tree  every  night.  but then, almost exactly a week ago, the cold from hell settled in my chest and each day got progressively worse and worse and worse until, suddenly, it's 3 p.m. on christmas eve and i haven't done  any  of those things i wanted to do, and in fact, i'm not sure i feel well enough even to drive to pennsylvania to visit my parents and open gifts and such (though i'm pretty sure i'll suck it up and make the drive, probably early tomorrow morning).   all of you, enjoy the holiday, the time off from work, the eggnog -- whatever your favorite part of all this is. basically, what i'm trying to say is: merry christmas, you bastards.

      my office holiday party was a few days ago.  i think someone, the day of the party, played a fun little game of telephone with the thousands of employees.  early in the morning, one of my coworkers mentioned that he'd heard no doubt was going to be playing at the party. ridiculous, yes. impossible? no. they are  sort  of connected to our company, through tangles and tangles of incestuous mergers. and i did some checking: they weren't on tour, so maybe, just maybe, they'd show up at some luxurious marriott in northern virginia to play "it's my life" and some other greatest hits.  oh please. who were we kidding? gwen was no doubt (pun intended) off somewhere in england with gavin, plotting to make babies or planning another six weddings in countries they might have missed the first time around.  i heard the rumor from another sixteen or so people throughout the day.  the party arrived.  no sign of no doubt. but, on the other hand, the  smithereens  were there.  the smithereens.  the poor, poor smithereens.

      i wish there was a quick and concise way to explain what i do for a living. i could just say that i write, which would suffice, but it inevitably garners the question "for whom?" the answer, of course, is the Large Company, and then people will ask, "well, what do you write for the Large Company?" and that's when it gets complicated.  because in order to understand what i'm writing, you have to be familiar with what the Large Company does, and more important, it really helps if you have used their service. what i do is a fairly noticeable part of the service. in fact, it's sort of scary how noticeable it is. something like 24 million people noticeable, which i try my best not to think about.  of course, the service is divided into six different "experiences," which is really only three "segments" because we then split up those six "experiences" into one, three, and two small "segments," and for each segment there are two writers. each day, each segment runs four spots. and that's what i do! i write those four spots! every other day, i write four spots. sometimes more, sometimes less.  on days like today, when there are four days off coming up (we don't get to pretend that saturday and sunday don't exist, we write for those days as well), when i'm writing every other day until next wednesday and i have to get them all done  pronto  and that means i'm writing tuesday, thursday, saturday, monday, and wednesday and that's four promos give or take for  each day  and the people i need info from about spots on saturday and monday aren't answering me and really, how am i supposed to write a spot when i don't know what the spot is  about  and it's drawing dangerously close to the daily 2 p.m. review meeting, which is supposed to last an hour but on days like today lasts a little more like two, i'm a little bit stressed out and i just wish, i wish i wish i wish, i could explain just how busy and frenetic this job is--and how much i adore it for all this insanity.  and i'd be able to do a much better job of it if i didn't have the worst cold  ever .

       why soccer moms and hockey practices don't mix, part one of an occasional series   when i started my new job three months ago, i took a hiatus from hockey. i thought i needed some time to settle into a new routine, get used to the work i'd be doing, get over the morning anxieties, and get comfortable with coming to work exhausted after an 11 pm.  new season has started; i sat out the first game, this past tuesday, to give myself an extra week of bronchitis healing.  earlier today, my team held a practice at the rink, which also features an arcade, a teen dance club, go-carts, and now, it seems, local indie-rock bands on thursday nights. it's also a pretty common place for soccer moms to organize birthday parties for their overspoiled offspring.  we had rented out the rink from 2 to 4 pm, the majority of which we spent scrimmaging with some of the more senior players in an upper division. at the same time we were practicing, a birthday party was going on in the arcade, and at 4 pm, the party was to take over the rink for skating.  (at one point, very early in the practice, the boy was fixing his skates, and a little boy from the party ran up to the boards and asked him, "do you play for  america ?" and proceeded to beg him for an autograph. the same boy told me after practice, as i was undoing my leg pads, "you're a really good hockey player!" and then ran away all shy. it was marginally cute.)  the practice itself was pretty uneventful and even a little boring. the team i'm playing has a lot of new players, so there was a lot of working on positioning and such, and not a lot of shots on goal.  at about 3:45, as the scrimmage was starting to heat up a little, a party-attending soccer mom wandered over to one of the benches to put on her rental skates.  what happens next, happened in slow motion.  puck moves down the ice.  skater looks to make a pass off the boards.  skater misjudges, misses the boards.  puck goes high.  puck goes high, flat-side, into the soccer mom's eye brow.   thud.   it was horrible, to say the least. one of those situations where it's nobody's fault - not the player's, not the woman's, if anyone's, then probably the rink's, for allowing people into the skating area before their allocating time - but still, one of those gut-sickening moments.  ice was gotten, kids were ushered away, tears were dried.  the rink was silent, and then, my teammate justin barks, "well, we still have ten minutes left. let's go."  and play continued.  (last but not least,  urlLink hockey erotica . um,  urlLink liz ,  urlLink snowy , you know anything about this? regardless, enjoy...)

       in the morning LIGHT   i love my new apartment. i do. it's so quiet i sometimes mistake it for a deserted island, my own private paradise, it's so clean it sparkles, it's so cozy i can never decide if i want to curl up in bed and look out the window at the sky and the trees, or if i want to nuzzle up on the couch with a book or maybe have a snack at the breakfast bar, or, well, you get the point.  signing the lease, we had a choice of three apartments; we picked this one for three reasons: 1) it's on the top floor, but because it's built on a hill, there's only one flight of stairs to reckon with, a huge plus when moving in (and, ultimately, out); 2) it's on the very outskirts of the property, meaning we won't be subject to too much foot traffic/dog-walkers/overexcited, screaming children at play; and 3) it faces away from the leasing office, which we continue to hope means we can get away with breaking certain property rules (no bird-feeders?  please. )  however, it took only one night and subsequent morning to realize the downside of our choice.  it faces east.  which means, since moving in, i have yet to spend a weekend morning sleeping past 9 a.m.  at the latest , which so far has been ok because i've been sick and in bed early for the entire month i've lived here, but i think that eventually i'd like to sleep until, i don't know, maybe eleven or something, like  normal  people do on saturdays and sundays after getting up before dawn on working days, instead of waking up bright and early and feeling like i should drop the kids of at the library to do their homework while i meet magda for brunch.  i realize the answer to this predicament -- and, really, it's not a predicament at all, i wouldn't trade this apartment for anything right now -- is a pair of heavy curtains or some wooden slant blinds, but i've been sick and all that,  ok ? plus, i like the unfettered look of the windows, i like the big open feeling of the room when it's daylight and i'm already awake, like now, when i can look outside and just see trees and sun. in the meantime, i've experimented with one of those silly eyeshades no real person ever actually uses, and found that they don't actually block out any light, they just make it completely impossible for you to open your eyes, thus blocking out the light anyway.  so it's bright, i will fix it, but first i complain about it. such is the way of the world. in the meantime, it's allowed the boy and i to invent a new game, in which one person attempts to drift back to sleep, while the other feigns sleep, until the real sleeping person starts to really really fall asleep, and then the feigning sleep person yells, "DOOOT!" as loud as they can, making the real sleeping person jump and wake, once and for all. and then, the feigning sleep person must go to the kitchen and make breakfast, but only if that person is male.

      at some point in the extra-long meeting i just escaped, i got the sudden uncontrollable urge to stick my pen cap up my nose.  i mean, all the way up my nose.  i don't know why it happened or where the urge came from, i do know that i had a very hard time concentrating for the rest of the meeting, because all i could think about was leaving the meeting, and sticking the pen cap up my nose.  back at my desk, i have managed to resist the urge this long, and i've decided that the cure for this sudden intangible insanity is copious amounts of alcohol, to be consumed immediately upon leaving the office, which, at this rate, should be around, oh, tomorrow sometime.  the super bowl is kicking my ass.

      dear ashton kutcher,  you, and whoever the studio it is behind the atrocity that's soon to be  urlLink the butterfly effect , are a serious bunch of ass clowns.  see, because your movie is so ass-tastic, your studio didn't release it for critics to see.  meaning, there are no critical reviews of your big dramatic debut.  that's generally a good indication that the movie is utter crap (but i think most of us who aren't demi moore guessed that just from watching the trailer, anyway.)  and, the suckiness of the movie and the whole not-releasing-it-to-critics thing has effectively rendered a large amount of work i did today  useless . meaning, i'm stuck here late tonight, and there's a minor chance i may miss some quality entertainment, like, say,  urlLink the oc  or even the premiere of  urlLink newlyweds .  and for that, and also, a multitude of things i don't have time to detail right now (though, seriously,  dude , stop with the screaming--maybe rumer and scout like it, but most of us over the age of 18 aren't having it) you suck.  ass clown.  love, the poo.

       you, also, will want these shoes   i haven't exactly been the best about updating or writing to this site since the big "return" and i can assure you, you're not the only one who's frequently caught themselves wondering why the hell i bothered coming back at all -- and i promise you that between now and the super bowl, it's only going to be worse than usual, because, apparently, someone decided that it was a good idea to put the new girl in charge of all the super bowl stuff, including in-game live updates and all the news and trivia leading up to the game, and while this is good news, really damn cool news if you think about how i've always sort-of wanted to work in sports, it pretty much means no life of my own for the next two weeks (by the way, nfl, thanks for the extra week off before the game this year!) -- so, like i was saying before the big digression, it's not going to get much better as far as writing and posting go.  and as much as i've wondered recently, really, why i bothered, i know, right now, that this site exists for me to share the awesomeness of the new shoes i bought today. and, despite poor lighting and a digital camera that was just about to run out of battery power, here they are, in all their glory:     and they are unbelieveably awesome, so awesome that they sort of make me  want  to go to work. and also, they make me want it to be spring, so i can wear them.  hurry spring, hurry.

       observations on telecommuting, day two   --it's really not even  that  bad outside.  --it's very fun to spend 70 percent of a conference call trying to get one of your cats to meow really loudly, so that when you succeed, everyone on the call stops to say, "awwwwww," and realizes, just for one small moment, that there are other goddamn things in life besides the super bowl.  --it's a lot easier to take an hour off and go over to the gym when you're within walking distance of it, and no one can pop by your pod and notice you're missing. unless you live with your boss, which is a whole other can of worms.  --there are no real boundaries of time when you work from home. at the computer at seven, still at the computer at seven. but...wait...  --my cats can be really annoying sometimes, with all the jump-on-lap and knead-knead-knead and head-butt-head-butt and please-please-please-pet-me and oops-i-knocked-over-the-water-dish-again and the mee-mew-meow-meeee.  --i've been taking some notes from  urlLink sarah b.'s  playbook; as i told her today, listening to the old 97's for the first time made me feel like i was crawling in to my old comfy pjs. and, i've been spending a lot of time reading in the bathtub. that girl knows what's up.  --it's not just cats that get the night crazies. last night at about 11 p.m., i got an uncontrollable fit of giggles that lasted 45 minutes. the boy, i think, wanted to smother me.  everything  was funny. except, nothing was.  --there's a big difference between bad quiet and good quiet.  --i can never, ever, ever,  ever  be a stay-at-home mom. i'm going crazy. i need people. i need conversation, and i need the roof to stop dripping.  --hyper hyper hyper need people  --alkjw oeiurpq owjlknv lireo  piwl lasko qwielka  oiu2rn .oaoia n pwo8el mn a;oi[ 0u324rna lia;nf n[; oiwera,,nz'ao OL ;oh O O OI Oa j OL   lhjasmdnfo  aiehdfna   yeah.

       that's the end   at approximately 5:10 p.m. yesterday, the madness ended. the last super bowl copy was written, perfected, and published.  after logging over fifty hours in the office over a period of just a few days (most of them days that normal people, like, take off), i worried, as i drove home, that i might start feeling a little deflated, a little dejected, a little sad that regular life doesn't live up to the huge-campaign madness.  was i going to get depressed? what would i do with the adrenaline? the anxiety? the thrill of the moment, the pressure, the success, the endless all-hands three-hour-long conference calls, the boob -- for the love of god, the boob and the madness it caused -- the dear-god-please-let-the-game-go-into-OT, so-i -have-extra-time-to-finish-writing but then it didn't, the constant announcements of just how tired i was. would i miss it?  i crawled into bed and fell asleep immediately (i slept something like four hours of the past 48).  and i woke up this morning, the boy's birthday and my first day off in ages, to the sound of rain against the window, and then a sudden in-bed water gun fight broke out, and there was some kissing and breakfast and plans, and i realized, it's good to be A Normal Person again.  and right now, A Normal Person would totally go shoe shopping.

       her grandmother   mary. half italian, half czech. gorgeous. her husband died twenty-seven years ago. she never remarried, she never even glanced at anyone else. she loved, and without doubt, she was lonely. she never cried, not that anyone ever saw.  she adapted to a life with her eldest daughter, an overweight diabetic agoraphobic of nearly four decades, accepted the routine and comforts of widow and spinster, a life of cleaning and cooking and sneaking cigarettes in the basement, sneaking off to the convenience store, and sneaking off for just a little fun.  she favored her one and only granddaughter. it was only natural. she was the youngest, and the one in closest proximity. she'd take her to lunch at the local restaurants, to beauty salons while she'd have her hair done, to the shops over town, where she'd buy little trinkets--crayons, coloring books, puzzles--to keep on hand for any whim that might strike.  she'd take her granddaughter to bingo, sometimes three nights a week: thursdays at st. paul's, saturdays at st. ann's, and sundays at st. mike's. sometimes, she'd pack up books and crayons and tapes and a walkman to keep her granddaughter occupied while she'd smoke and play her vast array of cards. as a child, she'd been blinded in one eye by a boy with good aim who'd disguised a chunk of brick in a snowball; her family was poor and without insurance, so the eye became infected, and eventually, useless. but she always knew how many numbers she needed before she had the four corners, or the letter 'h', or cover-all.  she could never get her driver's license, because of her poor eyesight, so they walked everywhere, or they'd take the community bus, which only had two stops--the local jamesway shops plaza a town away, and the local swimming pool, and only the shops plaza in the winter when the pool was closed. they'd wander around the shops together, more often than not returning home with some sort of small fish, or a hamster or gerbil, merely to aggravate her daughter and her mother.  she'd teach her to knit, to weave carpets and placemats, to create festive ornaments, to cook pasta, to write on the driveway with chunks of coal. for years, she'd point at the splotch of blue paint on the porch banister and laugh about the day her granddaughter had spilled it.  a few years later, her granddaughter dropped a brand-new gallon of milk on the kitchen floor, and panicked, called her grandmother asking how to clean up the ocean of white fluid covering the wooden floor. she was out of paper towels, out of dish towels, and moving on to toilet paper when she showed up at the door, having walked the two blocks to help as quickly as she could, armed with as many paper towels and rags as she could carry, and together they mopped and scrubbed for hours so that her daughter and her mother never knew.  when her granddaughter went away to college, she knitted her a heavy blanket in school colors to keep her warm. one summer, before classes started, she visited campus--a three-hour drive for someone with stiff legs and a small bladder--and marveled at the size, the enormity, and patted the statue lion's head and smiled for a photo that to this day sits prominently displayed on her granddaughter's dresser.  later that year, after the campus visit, in the middle of the night she had a stroke that suddenly made obvious the need for open-heart surgery, a triple-bypass, and during the surgery a stray blood clot extracted itself from her heart and moved to her eye--her good eye--and left that one, too, almost completely blind. for a time, she was ill, and immobile and lifeless and her granddaughter couldn't stand coming to visit, she couldn't stand how things had changed, how different she was--she hadn't yet realized that things would never be the same.  family holidays, once held at her home, were no longer. the family fragmented, each with its own celebration, hardly ever all crossing paths and reuniting, not even once a year, not anymore.   two years went by, and she got better, little by little. she started sneaking cigarettes again, sneaking off to the convenience store again -- mostly blind but familiar enough with the sidewalks and the streets and the intersections to make it home and back ok, at least in the good weather. but there was no more fun, at least not much of it;

she's ill, and she forgets, and she can hurt herself. the house will need to be sold, a home will need to be found. changes will have to be made.   tonight, this very night, her granddaughter will sit awake, heart heavy and sobbing, wishing for a redo, not to change things, not to fix things, but to relive it all: the bus rides, the fish, the bingo nights, the holidays, the hugs, the whole of it; not just for herself, for her own mother, who is broken and lost in the face of losing her mother, piece by piece by piece.  her granddaughter sits awake, crying for the beauty and the strength and the caring and the love and the luster and the  life  and the glory that oozed from her grandmother's every action, that now, slowly, without fail or remorse or pity or even the slightest shred of dignity, dutifully fades, and the only thing known is the fear of the end, when there is nothing at all left.

       oscar-meyer weiners   through no fault of our own, the boy and i have been invited to an oscar-themed party, whenever the oscars are being held.  neither of us is particularly big on the whole award-show thing (i'm pretty satisfied by reading over a list of who won in the following day's paper), so we won't be attending.  however, we mostly won't be attending because the party requires guests to bring some sort of oscar-themed dish.  given examples were "pirates of the caribbean: the curse of the black pearl black bean dip" and "charlize ther-onion rings" and "seabiscuit tripes."  for the LOVE of god.  give. me. a. break.  if we were going to attend, however, i have no doubt that we would be the jackasses who would show up late, holding a ripped grocery bag full of "21 grams of coke classic" and "cold mountain dew" and constantly asking for a "sofia coppola-of-tea."

       enough. with. the. cold.   my saturday night.  me: i am so tired of the winter. it's cold, and there's nothing to do. winter has created a rut.  the boy: it's not  that  bad. there's still stuff to do - we could go to a movie, or over to the bar to play darts, or out to dinner.  me: it's too damn cold to leave the house.  (five minutes pass)  me: i'm BORED.  the boy: let's go out and do something.  me: it's too cold outside!!!  (five minutes pass)  me: this sucks.  the boy: want to go rent a movie?  me: that's all we ever do.  the boy: but...if you don't want to go outside...  me: you're right, it's TOO COLD OUTSIDE.  (five minutes pass)  me: maybe  urlLink  bring it on again   is in...  (it wasn't.)  (i am a JOY to deal with right now.)  the bulk of the weekend was spent doing fun house-type stuff. the boy found a new place to live--his previous roommates were getting to be a serious hassle (*cough* stupid inside joke *cough*)--and he can move in pretty much anytime. yesterday we hit the usual--target, bed bath & beyond, etc.--for sheets and towels and comforters (side note: why must *all* guys insist on decorating their bathrooms [and whole places, for that matter] in either black or navy blue? i managed to talk him down to charcoal gray, but it was tough). saturday night we tasted our first foray into  urlLink home brewing  and ended up very drunkenly satisfied. also, seth myers' ZING skit actually makes it worth staying up past  snl's  weekend update these days.  today, while we waited for his new mattress to be delivered, i mopped and he did boy-style drilling, installing new toilet fixtures and such. once it was delivered and set up, we attempted, unsuccessfully, for the second time in less than a week, to get a table at  urlLink the lost dog , which has the absolute best onion rings and gourmet pizza and is now within walking distance of home. instead, we went to some dive and had 3 p.m. omelettes, which made me viciously ill, so i opted to test out the new mattress (a+) instead of going to see a matinee, and he continued to do fixer-upper stuff.  life is boring, but good, and i'm ready as all hell for summer.

       friday   if i had to guess, i would say that 95.7 percent of this country eagerly awaits fridays. the last day of the week! the harbinger of the weekend! two days of freedom! fun!  on the other hand, around here, the general consensus is usually summed up as "i hate fucking fridays." mostly because fridays are the worst day of the week; we struggle to accomplish three days of work in the amount of time we normally need to get one day done.  it's not fun.  it does, however, make us so much more eager to drink.  chocolate martinis, be patient -- i'm coming for you.

       tired   i am on call this week, which means the possibility of any-hours phone calls from people asking me to fix broken stuff.  normally, the calls come between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m., which is a high mistake time; i got a call at 6:15 a.m. this past saturday-- when i wasn't actually on call --and i'm pretty sure i was still drunk as i fixed some weird flash issue that i've never seen before.  i have a hard time sleeping when i'm on call; i generally stare at the clock and wonder when or if i'll get a call, if someone's looking at something broken that needs to be fixed and it's only a matter of seconds before the phone rings, and before i know it, it's time to get up and go back to work.  that's what happened this morning. i was restless, and my tossing and turning i woke the boy up. he looked at the clock and said, "it's six-thirty. sleep another half hour, you're home free." and then four minutes later the phone rang.  tonight, i'm tired, and i need as much sleep as i can get, so i'm about to get up from the computer and go fix myself another chocolate martini.  oh, i'll sleep tonight, you little fuckers.

       mystery #1,892, solved   sometimes, after i pee, and i turn around to flush (i do the kick-flush in public places, because i refuse to touch the flusher with my hand, even though i'm going to wash it immediately afterward), i wonder if other people in the bathroom see my feet facing the toilet and if they think i'm peeing standing up, like a guy.  today, i was washing my hands, and i glanced at the stalls behind me. a girl was standing with her back to the stall door, facing the toilet. and i thought to myself, "gross, she's standing up to pee. maybe she's a guy!"  so, i guess i don't need to wonder anymore.

       no need for alarm. no.  really.    i went to the library today, to pick up  urlLink a book i've been wanting to read . while i was there i grabbed a few other books, mostly just travel guides (the caribbean, hawaii, and san fran), as the boy and i are trying to plan a summer vacation, but we can't really decide where we want to go...nothing really jumps out at us (suggestions?).  so, as you've surely realized if you've been reading this website for longer than five minutes, i have a few minor neurotic tendencies. these mostly include obsessively washing my feet, collecting lamps and shoes, and not being able to leave the apartment without first getting a visual on both cats (this is not a complete list). and somewhere between my neurotic tendencies and my irrational fears is my security theft worry.  sometimes when i go shopping, mostly to malls, i get a little panicky when exiting stores that have those neck-high shoplifting detectors. i don't know why, exactly, but occasionally i'll get very panicky about setting the detectors off as i'm leaving a store, even though i haven't shoplifted anything in years. i hate the loud noise and the people turning to stare and the clerks coming over to eye me suspiciously. i have been known to hold my breath as i leave stores; i have also been known to abandon mall missions because of an overwhelming fear of setting off a detector. other times, i don't even notice it.  lately, i've been in a place where i haven't really noticed the detectors. which is good -- mental illness runs pretty long-distance in my family, so i try to keep whatever minor instabilities i notice in myself under control as much as i can. so tonight, when i was leaving the library with my book and travel guides in hand, i didn't notice that i had walked through a security device until i set it off.  EEEHHN. EEEHHN. EEEHHN.  in the silence of a library, my most irrational fear came to pass. at first i truly panicked, wondering what i had stolen by accident, maybe i am one of those people who steals things  without even knowing it , trying to subtly check my pockets and pants for books i might've copped without knowing it. then the nice clerk (well, at first i thought she was nice - but afterward i realized that this was her fault, somehow, and i'm not quite as keen on her anymore) called me back to the checkout desk (and to get there i had to walk back through the security device, setting it off again in the quiet of the library, and all the people continued to stare at miss stealsbooks) to confirm that she had, indeed, checked out all the books i was holding, and she had, and wasn't that funny, they should have been demagnetized. and then she had me walk through the detector again, and THANK GOD i didn't set it off this time, and then she handed me the books to the side of the detector, so we could sneak this one by it, and wished me a good night.  i almost started crying as i walked out to the car, even though i was wearing my favorite shoes  and  my favorite jeans, because when does your most irrational fear really, really happen? maybe it's not that irrational of a fear, maybe it's just silly, which it probably is, i admit, and it probably isn't even my most irrational fear, but it's still something that worries me and makes my heart pound and makes me worry that i am going to turn into some kind of monster without having any kind of control over it, which makes me want to melt into the floor and disappear forever.  i decided that the best course of action following this unfortunate incident was an hour soaking in raspberry-salted bathwater, reading  urlLink a good memoir  and listening to the new norah jones.  and now i feel mostly better.

       WARNING   it is rapidly approaching the time of year when every post on this website is guaranteed to involve at least some mention of brackets, bragging, drinking recaps, and ncaa basketball (i will remind the jury of this point in time last year, when the boy and i spent an entire saturday drinking and watching basketball, except for extended pauses for other sweet diversions, [and, in case you've forgotten, the end of this day of delights culminated in perhaps  urlLink the best picture of myself i've ever seen  {if i do say so myself}], not to mention how last year i got totally obsessed with that craig kilborne commercial, where he's filling out his bracket and he murmurs  urlLink 'the huskies, the big-boned team'  to himself [and if you suspect that i am totally, completely hoping and almost praying that this commercial makes a triumphant return for this year's tourney, you are 139 percent correct] and all this past evidence ought to make you see that i adore march madness).  and even though this year i will have to do a bunch of work-related tasks (something like the super bowl but hopefully one-tenth of the stress and involvement) during one or two of the games -- and can you believe, i even asked my boss last week if i could take off on the friday of the dance, to stay home and watch and drink and enjoy, and he said, flat-out, 'no, we need you here,' but i'm going to ask again, just in case he changes his mind -- i am still planning on enjoying every single moment of basketball, bracket bragging, and beer as i possibly can.  so, all i'm saying is, if you're not huge on college basketball fan, and you can't stand march madness or drinking stories or complaining about gonzaga losing when i was certain they'd go all the way or pictures of drunk girls on the verge of passing out with hand-drawn 'DAD' tattoos on their biceps, you probably want to come back a little while later.

       tv guidelines   incoherent observation #1. i saw a trailer for   urlLink jersey girl   tonight. in an effort, i suppose, to distance itself from that other jlo/ben movie, she isn't in the trailer  at all . not once. zero. zip. zilch. nada. this comes after word was released that jlo dies very early in the movie, making it more of a ben affleck/liv tyler movie. regardless...it seems pretty strange--and almost juvenile, as if affleck and kevin smith met behind closed doors about cutting her out--to have her completely absent when everyone definitely knows she's in the movie.  incoherent observation #2. having a headache (of course) i watched an episode of  will & grace  tonight; i haven't seen this show in several years. debra messing is, i take it, very pregnant in real life. and very visibly pregnant on the show -- no trick camera shots, no carefully placed flower arrangements to hide the bump, just a few baggy shirts but not a whole lot else. the whole half hour, zero mention was made of the character grace being pregnant despite the actress' very obvious way, and i'm assuming that's the standard line -- as she spent a lot of the episode drinking wine, and i'm guessing there are rules that disallow television networks from irresponsibly showing pregnant women consuming alcohol. and thus,  will & grace , i give you an official, super-sized What the Fuck?  incoherent observation #3. the one championship week game that i wanted to watch tonight (usc vs. arizona) doesn't come on until 11:45 tonight; i thought it started at 8:45. so i'm stuck watching clemson vs. uva. i've decided to cheer for uva, only because i often borrow the boy's bright orange uva sweatshirt, and the last time i borrowed it, we stopped in jcrew to look around and three different people asked me if i went to uva. the fact that i can still pass for a college undergrad makes me very pleased. the same time we were in that jcrew store, they had set out a breakfast spread of juice and donuts, and i made an accidental mess by spilling a large quantity of juice everywhere. as the boy and i were mopping it up with the provided napkins, i saw not one but two jcrew employees nervously notice our mess and our cleanup, then look away as if they couldn't bear the thought of stooping so low as to clean up spilled juice in their crisp khakis and spring-fresh crewnecks. at least we didn't spill anything on their precious clothes, though we did consider it.  really really random link #1:  urlLink espn interviews liz phair . i still like her.

"it's almost seven," he says. "listen," i tell him, "you can try to wake me up all you want, you can even rustle that damn plastic bag some more, but there's No Fucking Way i am getting out of this bed before my alarm clock goes off!"  exactly 6:57 a.m.: just as the word 'off' escapes my mouth, my alarm clock rings. i scream, "FUCK YOU, ALARM CLOCK!" then throw it against the wall, get out of bed, and take a shower.  i (heart) mondays.

       entertainment, weekly   1.  i went to see  eternal sunshine of the eternal mind  over the weekend. i can't say enough good things about this movie (and i'm so tempted to quote the christopher walken line from  america's sweethearts : 'i can't talk about this movie without crying'); it was the most gorgeous, stunning, moving, and heartbreaking movie i've ever seen. i don't remember ever watching a movie and concentrating  so much  on keeping my sobs under control. seriously. go see it.  2.  i watched a lot of basketball this weekend. on saturday morning, i said, with confidence, to the boy, "there were too many upsets in the first round. there won't be a single upset in the second round." um, i was a little wrong. bye, kentucky! bye, stanford! lucky for me...i'm still sitting pretty in two of the three pools i joined: first place in one, tied for 11th (but tied for third in terms of points possible) in the other. let's just hope uconn keeps it going.  3.  the new wilco album is all over the file-sharing services. it's luscious, and you should really get it. and then buy it once june comes.

       smokey joe, smoke smokey joe   it was a random seventy-degree day here yesterday, so after work the boy and i decided it was time for the first barbeque of the summer. more important, a foods-shaped-like-penises barbeque, which means we had hot dogs and zucchini, cooked on the boy's new weber smokey joe.  the hot dogs were specially purchased fat-free hot dogs, which made it totally acceptable for the boy to eat three. where i come from, we break most foods in half -- cookies, for example -- before eating them (so that all the calories fall out), so i can totally get behind his mode of thought.  while slicing up the zucchini (am i spelling that write? what a freak of a word) i sliced open my thumb. i would like to say it is cut down to the bone, but it's not, only really about halfway, but it required immediate attention and there was a lot of blood and bandaging and grimacing (he did the bandaging, i did the grimacing). i can feel it throbbing inside the band-aid right now, as blood seeps out. not real keen on blood.  during the last bit of  american idol  (was i not paying attention, or did ryan not say 'seacrest out' last night, making it an even bigger waste of time to have watched?), some friends called and we changed, heading out to meet them at a bar. as i stepped out of the apartment, i just barely avoided falling -- the boy had placed the smokey joe right in front of the door to keep an eye on it as it cooled off.  "smokey joe!" the boy yelled, throwing his hands up in frustration. "i told you to go home! get out of here!!"  this was the funniest thing i have heard in a long, long time, and created a stream of debate about whether or not smokey joe would make a good, sustainable tv show -- if  alf  could, why couldn't a serious about smokey joe, i argued? -- at the culimination of which i decided i would learn to draw, use photoshop really well, and completely ripoff  urlLink giraffes and elephants  with a daily smokey joe comic.

       stupid pet tricks, volume one   the boy got a new digital camera with all of his march madness winnings.  he had a game last night.  while he was gone, he left the camera in my possession.  and this ( had to take it down, went over my bandwidth - oops!  ) is what i needed to prove to the world. please note the glare he gives the camera, as if to say "i can't believe i am getting away with this." also note my poor cameramanship, and admire my fun capri pajamas.  the fact that i am able to share this makes me happier than pie.

       diet watch    south beach, day one (monday)   i eat some eggs for breakfast. immediately after finishing, my stomach yells, "ok, i'll take some cookies now!"  i make it through the whole day carb-free, but i feel like i spend the whole day thinking about cake. and french fries. and bread. and cookies.  did i mention cookies?  i go to bed completely starving, with a plan to go back to the grocery store for things like yogurt and ricotta cheese and cottage cheese, which i didn't think i'd need to snack on during the original run.  four different people tell me that after a few days the craving will go away. oh yeah? how about the dull aching hunger? will that fade, too? i wonder.   south beach, day two (tuesday)   i have turkey bacon with the eggs. it's the most delicious thing i've ever tasted. when finished, my stomach asks for some thin mints.  at approximately 11 a.m., i am on the verge of tears. hungry. it's too early for string cheese! i quit. i go to the cafeteria and find 'carb control' yogurt, which i immediately decide is ok. it is the most delicious thing i have ever tasted.  at 3 p.m., i offer to cut off my pinky for an oreo. just one.  after work, i go to the grocery store. i make the quiche to-go cups, which my brain for some reason thought would actually be spongy like muffins, but they are in fact, just eggs and cheese. (i know this from eating four.) fine.  i move on the the cauliflower mashed potatoes. i don't think i've ever eaten cauliflower in my life -- i find it's whiteness suspicious, like it's hiding something behind all that innocence. after prepping the recipe, i realize i don't have a blender. a juicer, a hand mixer, but no blender.  i decide to go with the hand mixer (the juicer does not belong to me and i feared cauliflower's lack of juice would break its will). the hand mixer is a poor choice; even on the lowest setting, CAULIFLOWER FLIES EVERYWHERE.  undettered, i place a colander over the bowl to catch the flying cauliflower and go back to mixing. IT STILL GOES EVERYWHERE. i tuck the unmashed faux-potatoes into tupperware, resolving to buy a blender tomorrow.  next up is dessert. i have some really good "allowed" fudge pops in the fridge, but i decide to try one of the ricotta desserts from the book, which the boy last night said "looked delicious."   i make the chocolate dessert: ricotta, some cocoa powder, some vanilla. i mix it, and the cats come running into the kitchen. i realize that what i've made looks EXACTLY like the soft food they get now and then when i'm feeling especially guilty about neglecting them. after some consideration, i realize that the boy is blind, because this dessert looks disgusting.  as i type, the ricotta dessert is beside me. i can't eat it. in fact,  urlLink reno  just came up to sniff it and stalked away angrily when he realized that it wasn't his food. this can't be right.   for future reference   this is the first and only time there will be an all-diet post. this will not be a diet site.  more important, i urge you to start a pool; whoever comes closest to my exact date and time of failure gets something, maybe a mix cd.

       help, please   the boy gave me a sewing machine for my birthday.  i've never sewed, except for long-ago afternoons with my grandmother when she expertly handled all the controls.  i know nothing.  i've just always had this passing desire to make my own clothes, skirts and pink pants and original, fun stuff. and i'm super-excited to start.  i have no idea where to start -- except maybe the cd-rom that came with the machine.  i know  tons  of you blog people are very creative -- help! where should i start? are there any good books i should look into getting? any good websites to visit?  and most important, is my dream of making a super-cute bright blue skirt with a see-through pink overlay (i don't even know the names of these materials...) completely unattainable?

       interesting things that have happened in the last few days, many involving poop   -- kill bill volume two  was pretty good, though my claustrophobic ass almost had to leave during  that  part  --i went to a fabric store and almost pooped myself while looking at all the gorgeous colorful fabrics. the clothes i want to wear are simple, but colorful. it was frustrating to admire but have no idea how to create. so, i signed up for a class. it starts in a few weeks.  --i had a really bad monday, which was made abruptly better when the boy made a surprise visit bearing salmon and pistachios and flowers, and we had dinner and went for a long walk, then fell asleep watching the chris rock special (so. damn. funny.)  --i went to a bbq at a friend's apartment high above the city. there was rocking out to classic liz phair. i didn't get drunk.  --i've been 27 for ten days.  --i stopped doing the hard-core south beach diet thing, but have kept on with the low-carb, low-fat, low-cal diet, plus tons of exercise. and i've only lost three pounds. harrumph. i expect results NOW.  --i caught  urlLink reno  unexpectedly in the bathtub, and he was so startled that he pooped a little. i wanted to be mad, but it was just too damn funny. "oh my god i don't want another bath!!" (yeah, i gave him a bath once. it was sooo fun.)   --the o.c. is on tonight, and while that didn't *technically* didn't happen yet, i am certainly anticipating it with glee.  and that's about it. exciting, i know.

       sixth grade, all over again   i've recently encountered a situation that bears striking resemblance to the sixth grade. and anyone who's ever been in sixth grade, and especially anyone who was female while in sixth grade, would empathize.  you remember: a group of friends decides to go horseback riding one weekend. you love horseback riding, you love horses, you love these friends.  alas, you're not invited to go horseback riding.  so, the sixth-grade you, you probably feel really hurt and left out, you probably even cry a little bit to your mom -- maybe you even go so far as to plan something really extraordinary, like getting a moon-bounce in your backyard, and then you make it a large point not to invite over that specific clique. ultimately, you forget the slight, you move on, and eventually, more than likely these people disappear from your life like baby fat and acne (if you're lucky) and you grow up.  but then -- as a supposed grownup -- a similar sixth-grade situation arises, and you're feeling a little bit of deja vu.  but you're a grownup, right?  you know how the sixth-grade you would respond. hurt feelings, a few tears, a little revenge. right. but how would a grownup respond? (think how glorious of a revenge you could craft now, with your strong arms, disposable income and collection of knives.) do you just brush your shoulder off, or do you face the situation, point out the hypocrisy and sixth-grade-ness of your counterparts? or do you just take the high road, and wish them a good time and smile, knowing that there are more important things--not to mention people--in your life?  i'm not sure, honestly. but i don't appreciate feeling reverted to the sixth-grade, i don't appreciate immaturity, i don't appreciate, well, any of this. yes yes, it's my responsibility to control my feelings, and i'm doing a pretty good job of it, i think; i'm just...curious. looking back through history; yes, this has happened before, and no, the people in question never managed to become  good  friends. and that tells me something.  so what would you do?

       battle of who could care more   every night, on my way home from work, i have the exact same battle with myself.  i should go to the gym. i don't want to go to the gym. you ate like a pig today. i didn't. you had frozen yogurt. it was non-fat! you had too many carbs. i ate plenty of carbs for years and i'm still alive. you're going to get fat. i don't care. yes you do. ok, i do. but one fro-yo won't make me gain 800 pounds. it could. eventually. it won't. plus, you want to have a glass of wine tonight. so? more calories. true. oh, and there's no wine at home. i don't want to go to the grocery store. good! don't! no extra calories. a glass of wine would be delicious. i had a shitty day. you have a shitty day every day. and most days i don't have wine! i beg to differ, alkie. i don't feel like going to the grocery store anyway. good. i do need hummus, though. you eat too much hummus. hummus is ok. you're too lazy to go to the grocery store. maybe i shouldn't go, and just go to the gym, and not have a glass of wine. exactly. but wine would be so good. and hummus and pita and cheese. fattie. i can still squeeze in the gym and the grocery store. no you can't. i can. you want to watch wasteland tv tonight. true. i think i can make it. you can't. ok, well then i'll just skip the gym. don't. i went the last two nights. so? i deserve a night off. but you ate like crap today. i'll make up for it tomorrow. and you're going to want wine tonight. i think it's ok. shouldn't i be good to myself once in awhile? no. why would you deserve that? because i work my ass off, i'm tired, and ultimately i'm a good person? whatever you say... ok, i'll go to the grocery store, then do the gym quick, it's not like i have anything else to do, really. you could write. when was the last time you wrote something worthwhile? i don't know. you're a hack. i write for 10 hours a day at work. that doesn't count. it doesn't mean anything. it's hard to have more creativity for me at night. i'm always so tapped. maybe you just didn't have any creativity to begin with. i don't deny that possibility. and you'll probably never make anything of yourself or write anything meaningful. i'm coming to accept that. so you're laying down and dying? no, i'm just living. i'm doing my best. you're doing terribly, then.  and...so on and so on over the course of the 40-minute drive.  is this normal? does everyone have this sort of battle of wills with themselves (not to mention running dialogue)? or am i just completely fucking crazy as i've always suspected?  the truth is that i just don't know how to be good to myself. i don't know what it means to relax, to take a night off, a night to myself, because i'm always wondering what i should do next, and what i should be doing right then and there because don't i need to be doing  something ?  i'm harder on myself than any person who cares about me would be. and i really don't know how to stop. does anyone?

       no more pencils, no more books   i stayed home from work today thanks to some persistent and worrisome symptoms i've been having. not real keen on discussing, but the seriousness of today's issues moved me from "i hate doctors" to "yeah, i should look into this." so, i go to the doctor on monday. which i guess is good.  staying home for work unfortunately doesn't mean not doing any work, but i did take a short walk this afternoon, upon which i came across a boy walking a bulldog puppy, who threw himself into the grass at my feet, rolled over, and demanded that i rub the buddha. i could not resist. bulldog puppies look exactly like grownup bulldogs in a strange way i can't explain.  i spent a lot of the day thinking about things i would never do again if i never had to do them again. follow? there are no genie tricks in my alternate universe; if you pick 'never clean the litterbox again' (which i did consider) the cats don't die immediately of unable-to-poopness (which i did fear, but like i said, this is  my  alternative universe and tricky genies have been seriously disallowed because I Don't Have Time For Their Shit).  so, here are my three things i would like to never have to do again:  1. work (obviously) - and of course i continue to make a rising stream of income that allows me to live very comfortably.  2. gain weight - the goodness of this one is remarkable...remain the same weight as i am right now...eat whatever i want...drink hoppy goodness every night...cake, cookies...caaaaaaake...never go to the gym. there is a loophole here which could prove difficult if the situation arose, but i prefer not to think about it.  3. blow-dry my hair - 90-degree heat plus extra-thick wavy hair that needs straightening equals why-even-bother-taking-a-shower-because-i'm-completely-sweaty-again. in the future, my hair will instantly dry *POOF* in the exact style i want as soon as i step out of the shower.  i considered adding cleaning and laundry to the list also, but i am ashamed to admit that i sort of enjoy those things, as well as recently gaining an affinity for sitting in traffic. at least i'm not at work, right.  so what are the three things you'd like to never do again?

      1. i went to one of those large, impersonal universities where you spend your first few years in classes unrelated to your degree along with thousands of other students, and then you spend your last few years in degree-related courses with twenty or so other students, all of you slowly realizing you have made a terrible decision about your future because your major sucks, and some of you will get out in time and switch to something else, something meaningful, and others, like me, will be too chickenshit to admit a mistake and spend more time and money on a different degree that i probably would've realized was bullshit as well.  in one of those thousand-student classes, in a large amphitheater-style classroom, i took a film analysis class and later, and even more pointless, a biological sciences class. being a public relations major officially and incapable of adding numbers larger than 16 in my head unofficially, science and math were not so much my things.  the bi-sci instructor was a short little blonde woman, unfortunately i can't remember her name, and i can't forget something she said one day during a lecture about nerves. it went something like this:  "i'm sure some of you have stepped into a tub of hot water on a cold day and stimulated both your hot and cold nerve receptors at the same time and gotten that awful tingly feeling. i bet you  never  want to do that again!"  i find that i think about this statement almost every time i take a shower, because i just don't understand what the fuck she meant. does she mean the feeling of not wanting the water to touch you at all? i've been cold under hot shower water, sure. but she said "some of you" and hasn't everyone done that? daily? and if we do it daily, do we really daily think "i  never  want to do that again!" because honestly, is it really all that fucking bad?  2. far more painful is another professor's echoing statement, this time an english professor with whom i had a long, long love-hate relationship. as one person on  urlLink rate my professors  put it, he was an old school, ivy league educator.  he walked into class on the first day of class -- every class, because i was so intrigued that i first took his fiction writing class and then his 400-level drama course, which was the largest amount of coursework i managed all through college and also seriously the most i learned from any course, hands down -- and taught. expected answers, expected readings to be done, expected books to have already been purchased. expected your interpretations and thoughts, and fully berated you when you were incorrect.  that's not to say he wasn't rewarding. in the ficton-writing class, the first story i wrote of two assignments, he was so celebratory he brought copies to the next class for the whole class to read. he pushed, and he gave back for what he thought was a solid, creative effort. after i graduated, i continued to keep in touch with him for awhile, and now that i think about it maybe he had some big  dead poets society  hopes for me, as he was always pushing grad school and the writing life, and i guess i've gone and ruined that for him, becoming a corporate whoremonger who spreads her legs for any advertiser over $300K at the bidding of her boss' boss' boss' boss.  but, when he was bad, he was bad. the second story assignment from that class, it's right here, i could reach into a drawer and pull it out with only a slight arm movement. the first story earned me an a- and the second story a d -- the worst grade i think i ever received all through eight zillion years of schooling, dropped classes not counted (the fact that i'm a big nerd should really not be shocking to anyone reading my  website ) -- and i can recite the comments he typed on it (in all caps) verbatim, without reaching into the drawer:  "this story represents a sharp falling off in your writing. your first story was pointed, developed, and thematically significant. when we met to discuss your progress, you indicated that you were unsatisfied with the direction it was taking. yet you continued to push along an idea that was stillborn from the start. D."  stillborn.  there are times, daily even, when i'm writing on something at work, muddling along, tweaking, can't get it quite right, that those words flip through my mind. is this idea stillborn? am i pushing it along? do i totally and completely suck?  3. i think perhaps this post was stillborn, and  american idol  is starting.

      i don't think i have ever wanted to go to bed so badly before in my life.  but. i'm stuck. i'm working. it's midnight.  people need their avril lavigne, though. oh yes, they do. and there's no sleep until avril is ready. avril is a bitch. and she wears too much eye makeup. though she is canadian so she gets points for that.  so. anyway. i went to the doctor today. preliminary neurological tests were normal. i'm being "aggressively treated for carpal tunnel" just in case that's the problem (which is doubtful because i really spend hardly any time at all at the computer). and the doc is setting me up to see a neurologist who specializes in ms, but that appointment probably won't be for several weeks.  so we go back to normal, and stop thinking about it.  so.  today, when i was driving to the doctor, i drove by franklin farm park, and they had a sign outside that said "new baby." and as i drove by one of the paddocks, i saw a little black cow and i thought, "ooh, the baby" and then i realized it was just a regular grown-up little cow, it was just my mind, it was just that i wanted to see the baby cow because i wanted some cute.  seriously.  and i'm sober and  working  right now.

      my dad has  urlLink it .  when i started having similar symptoms, he asked his neurologist if it was possible.  only a five percent chance, the neurologist had said, of it running in families.  extremely rare.  that was four months ago.  the symptoms continue.  i skipped work last week; when i woke up in the morning, my arms were numb. driving to work seemed unnecessarily risky.  i made a decision ... it was time.  i will see a doctor, i will have the mri, i will undergo any test they ask.  but.  i will  not  have a spinal tap.  you don't have to, my dad reassures me, you can refuse it.  i will  not  have a spinal tap.  worried, yes; overly, no.  only a five percent chance.  until.  my first cousin, michelle, mother of five, is diagnosed on friday.  my paternal cousin.  my dad tells me the news on saturday.  five percent doesn't seem right anymore.  five percent seem way off.  five percent seems really low.  doesn't run in families?   bullshit.   i'm not worried, i tell my dad. it's too early to worry. on monday, they'll look at the symptoms, the history, send me to some specialists.  it's too early to worry, i repeat.  but i'm lying.  i'm worrying.   **quote new unquote site design is owed to the quote not worrying unquote. purely a diversionary technique.

(this item may also have had something to do with the first item.) and it's perfect really, because now the boy can have his little crush on maggie, i can crush on jake, and it's almost like incest, but not quite.  --a trip to the swimming pool  --sunscreen applied to all cicadas that were passed on the way back to the swimming pool  --randomly waking up at 5 a.m.  --do i really need to go on? it's only sunday morning, and today i'm totally going to see my boyfriend jake in  the day after tomorrow  (which  ew  calls  dat  through the entire issue, which made me smile every time i saw it, because it reminded me of the time me and l. beat the boy and b. at 'battle of the sexes' on the last question "what does d.a.t. stand for" [and they were soooooo confident we wouldn't know it] and i screamed, "digital audio tape!!" and l. was so excited, and then i had to confess that the only reason i knew that was because i'd seen  the blair witch project  one too many times, and then i started yelling, all-heather-like, "get the fucking dat!" and then i went home and threw up many, many times on a morning that just happened to also be my birthday, but it was totally worth it.)  --after the movie, there may be bowling.  --and last time i went, i bowled a forty, so Watch The Fuck Out!

      conference rooms are for conference calls.  see?  CONFERENCE room = CONFERENCE calls  they go together! it's that simple!  or, you know, you could have a conference call with eight freaking people in the pod right across from me, talk loudly for an hour and prevent me from doing anything other than finding a new buddy icon that looks EXACTLY like a penis, and only a little like a thermometer, and also laughing loudly and disrupting your meeting. but see, i wouldn't be bothering you if you were in the CONFERENCE ROOM.

      i am perhaps more relaxed at the moment than ever before. tired, after waking last night every hour on the hour because of a dream that would stop and then start right up again, but perhaps the most fun, most relaxing, most do-nothing weekend ever.  we went  urlLink here , but we spent most of our time  urlLink here  and when enough beers were consumed, it started to look more like  urlLink this . there was a lot of sitting in rafts sipping beers and talking, but not a whole lot of sunlight as the entire weekend was one big, long cloud.  yesterday we rented a boat, and there was a lot of  urlLink this  (that's me) and  urlLink this  and all parties involved are so sore today that walking and carrying bags and groceries have proven difficult.  there are also a number of videos, including one perfect pump fake and fumbled pass during a leap off the dock, as well as some brutal of tubing wipeouts where the victims skim across the water for five or six frames, but those are just too big to upload.  i'm beautifully relaxed but exhausted, and i'm going to watch the last bit of hockey i can, get drunk, and pretend i don't have to work tomorrow.

      the boy and i have been playing racquetball pretty frequently these days. i use the term racquetball loosely, as neither of us has played before and therefore neither of us actually knows the real rules of racquetball.  instead, we play by a variation of made-up rules (that we assume must be pretty close to the official rules, because how complicated can it truly be?) that we call charcoal briquette ball. actually, it's mostly me who calls it that, the boy mostly just shakes his head and rolls his eyes.  when we first started playing, i'd get my ass completely kicked. i've never played a racquet sport before in my life (except for a few rounds of topless badminton at  urlLink styro's  bbq, which totally doesn't count), while the boy was once Intramural Badminton Champ in college. i'm a little too competitive, but how can i compete with that?  at first, i couldn't. he'd destroy me, 15-1, 15-3. i had nothing.  except, the last few times we played, i've gotten better. a couple nights ago, i was down 13-6, then went on a scoring streak to make it 13-11 -- but then lost 15-11. the crowd was going nuts, though, and i couldn't help but feel proud when al michaels interviewed me after the match. i'd make it on the pro charcoal briquette ball circuit yet.  then last night was the same situation...down 7-1. start a comeback. actually went ahead, 8-7. and then he started beating me again. and then i started making rookie mistakes. and then he starting making really tough shots, really intentional showing-off type shots.  and i got pissed.  and i threw my racquet.  and i shouted, "who are you, johnny fucking racquetball?"  and tense, angry play continued. (credit must be given to him here...he didn't laugh, he didn't get angry, he didn't do  anything  except continue to play, knowing that i'm only emotionally capable of being angry for 10 minutes at a time, and then this would pass.)  and then, after 10 minutes, i asked:  "did i just call you 'johnny fucking racquetball'?"  "you did."  for the next five minutes, there was a time-out taken as we both laughed our asses off.   johnny  fucking  racquetball.  i ended up losing, 15-11 again.

      i go for an MRI tomorrow. have i mentioned that? i can't remember. i'm focusing on the actual test, worrying about the skinny tube, feeling claustrophic, flipping out, but, hey, i've got some valium, right? right. or maybe i'm just focusing so much on the logistics of the test so i don't have to think about the results, which i'm not even sure i get that day, or if i have to wait a few days, or how that works.  there are plenty of things in the world that are statistically unlikely, but that happen anyway.  why not this?  i'm making plans like nothing is going to change, not knowing what's on the other side of thursday. it's a strange feeling.  i'm going horseback riding on saturday.  i'm going to see  urlLink this movie  on saturday night. in fact, i may buy tickets to a 10 pm show right now. because no matter what, cute tiger cubs always fix everything.

      straight ahead: guy with awesome sneakers who hums to himself all day long. random humming. i can never place the tune. humming. humming. humming that makes me want to rip off my ears and shove them down his humming throat.  to my right: blonde about-to-be divorcee who talks on the phone all day long, and is JUST SO HAPPY, EVERYTHING IS GREAT! at least until she breaks down sobbing for the third time that day. a.k.a. the girl who turns her speakers up really loud and talks to someone whose buddy sound is a baby crying all day long. no, not annoying at all.  to my left: little miss nature girl...french braid, hiking boots, save the wolves calendar, completely impossible-to-say consonant-on-consonant name. wears a headset and talks on the phone all day long, getting more and more agitated until she's finally screaming. then, usually hangs up and calls a friend about how hard her daughter is taking the divorce.  across the row: really important guy with a double-wide pod and too many phone lines. will not hesitate to answer his cell phone while on his office phone, or vice versa, and always asks, almost angrily, "can i call you back, i'm on the other line" as if it's the fault of the person who's calling that he's a jackass who answers call waiting AT WORK. this is what voicemail is for. welcome to 1981.  two rows over: useless goober who talks really loudly on the telephone, most of the time to his mistress. "if my wife finds out, she'll divorce me!" i hope she cuts off your head and skullfucks it with her dildo before she divorces you.  also two rows over: bushy ponytailed misogynist who does not make eye contact with any woman he passes in the halls. i test this by crossing my eyes, grabbing my boobs, or other such things. he does not notice. to him, women do not exist. someday, i am going to cut off his ponytail and strangle him with it.

      i have a bad habit of telling little white lies to people i think i'll never see again, so that the little white lies will never come back to haunt me. approximately 98% of the time, these people are shop clerks.  i fully realize that i'm setting myself up for disaster; that at some point down the road i'm going to tell some ridiculous lie to a stranger who ends up being my new boss, and then she'll remember how i once told her that i have a steel plate in my head from a freak snowboarding accident, and then after she constantly asks if i have a headache or need time off, i'll have to confess that no, really, i don't have a steel plate in my head, i just like playing with strangers' minds.  i'm not entirely sure why i do this, but i have a theory about why i find it so enjoyable -- i do my best to be constantly honest with the people in my day-to-day life (a policy i only started following at age of 21, when i no longer had to swear to my mother that i caught some kind of stomach flu, when i could finally officially and legally say i drank a 12-pack of rolling rock totally by accident and  that  was why i was puking every 20 minutes), so it's kind of fun to make up a ridiculously untrue fact about myself on occasion.  previous little white lies have included:  --i have a steel plate in my head from a freak snowboarding accident (see above) --i am picking up this micro-touch trimmer for my mom, she's hoping it will weedwack all the hair on her chin --i'm allergic to raisins, chocolate, banana-scented candles and conditioner --i own a parrot whose name is, inexplicably, captain bo-bo midway meatpacker (he was already christened when i inherited him from a failing uncle, and he can only speak the phrase "i need more syrup, NOW!") --i need the perfect dress to wear to upstage my older sister at her bridal shower, because i've upstaged her my entire life and i'm not about to stop now  part of me hopes that the shop clerks leave work that night thinking about the girl wth the steel plate/hairy mom/random allergies/oddly named parrot/huge chip on her shoulder, and the other part of me knows that they're not listening to a word i say.  which means i can just tell a new and completely improved lie the next time i come back.

      so, the mri went well, once the valium kicked in the urge to start kicking and screaming "let me the fuck out of here!" went away.  it turns out i have a      (a brain with a balcony inside of it.)  i go back to the neurologist on monday for diagnosis, look-seeing for lesions and whatnot. i've sort of given myself over to fate. it's out of my hands now, and i'm done worrying about it.  after the mri, the boy took me for ice cream, some new place called cold stone creamery, where they have cake batter ice cream. it was a life-altering experience, despite senses dulled by valium.  my favorite part of the day was when he tucked me into bed, kissed my forehead, and closed the door. he went back to work, and five hours later i was still asleep.  nobody is better at sleeping than me. i've gone weeks without because of insomnia, but when i'm on, i'm  on .  yesterday, we went horseback riding. i haven't been in years, and it was the boy's first time.     my horse's name was franklin and i loved him as much as you can love a horse that constantly stops to eat branches and enjoys ramming riders' legs into saplings.  it was very good fun though, and the boy and i both decided that, looking as good on horseback as we do, if ever offered a part in a movie that requires a lot of riding, like  hidalgo  or something, we would definitely take the role.  the farm was teeming with     it was hard not to take one home, but they were all very spooked and non-people friendly, which surprised me.  last night, we went to see  two brothers , several times during which i leaned over to the boy and said, "i hate this movie so fucking much."  tiger cubs = cute.  a 40 percent tiger mortality rate in a movie = really fucking annoying.  today, my back hurts something fierce from the riding yesterday. every time i rolled over in bed last night i did so with a low moan.  and, just for fun, here's a photo of me in my underwear, a good example of what you'd probably see if you walked into my bedroom any weeknight around 10 p.m. or so.     sike!

      --at the hotel room friday night, i played in my very first texas hold'em game against real people instead of a computer, and in a predictable stroke of beginner's luck, i saw two flushes, two straights, pocket aces, pocket jacks, and a ridiculous ace-eight full house on the flop...dominating the boys i was playing against and taking all their money, which was really just all the change that i'd emptied out of my wallet for us to play with. at some point in time, i started pretending that i was playing on  celebrity poker showdown  (which is on tv  right now ), and i'm fairly certain that i'm never happier than when i'm playing in a game of cards, much less winning. i am now determined to start a girl's poker night; i just need to convince the girl with the right apartment to host us.  --just for fun, i yelled a ridiculous insult at my mother as the boy and i drove by her and my father on the main street of the university, to which she waved at me blankly, then said to my father, "you know, i should have flipped that stupid bitch off instead of waving!" to which he responded, "that was your daughter." she didn't believe him until we met for dinner a half hour later, and i verified the story.  --i ran into the harsh english professor i wrote about in   urlLink this post , and he had no recollection whatsoever who i was. nothing jogged his memory, and then i realized -- it was five years ago. if he didn't remember me, why was i still letting his criticism flutter through my head?  --i have long been a detractor of abercrombie and their ridiculously jacked-up prices, ass-ugly tattered clothing, and the character, style, and sub-culture it pushes. but when i reached for the size ten that would've fit me had i been in the gap, and found it too big, and the same for the eight and just barely the six -- the  six  -- i sort of loved abercrombie, just a little. i still didn't buy the skirt, though.  --i've also long been a detractor of motorcycles, and today witnessing a horrifying crash in which the rider swerved to avoid the braking car in front of him, hit a patch of gravel, pitched forward over the handlebars and bounced three times before landing prone in a heap, unconscious confirmed my absolute hatred, and i hope anyone who's every thought of even just riding one will now reconsider. despite being broken and twisted, the cyclist was awake and breathing when we finally drove off; and i hope to hell he gets well and takes the insurance check for his destroyed harley. (side note: isn't there some kind of federal tax on every cell phone bill that will direct your call to the nearest 911 call center when you dial? and if that's the case, why, when i called 911 today, did the phone just ring and ring and ring? [luckily, there was an volunteer firefighter in the car directly behind us who radioed in the call])  --on a fourth of july whim -- after months of hating my hair to an extent you couldn't possibly imagine, the way the top layers curve down and the bottom layers flip out, you can't  possibly  imagine the horror -- i went walking around the little college town to find a place i could get a haircut, found four closed salons, and gave up. but i did wander into cvs, where i bought a straightening iron, and had the biggest, most important life-changing experience of my life. technology can erase the horrible not-curly not-straight wave i was born with. I CAN HAVE STRAIGHT HAIR!  --pint glasses stolen, an albino deer patted on the head, cows counted & buried, tears of the lion consumed, cigars smoked, amber bock n/a invented, kill-marry-fuck enjoyed,  tombstone  watched at least 1.5 times.  --do i really have to go to work tomorrow?

      i got a gmail account. and, stupidly, i registered my entire full name, instead of trying to get just my first name. rookie mistake. so, in order to get invitations to give out (to myself), i've been trying to use it more.  i've basically just been emailing the boy, whose email address is his_name@blahdiddyblah.com. except, instead, i've been sending mail to hisname@blahdiddyblah.com all this time. (see! underscore! big difference!) hisname, a professor of pathology from california, has been forwarding all my messages to the boy.  these are messages that link to raunchy ebay auction items or say things like 'I OWN YOU ON THE RACQUETBALL COURT, BITCH!!'  hisname is undaunted by my crassness.  "do you know this girl?" he writes to the boy. "she's feisty."  eventually -- and this discourse goes on for  over a week  before i'm actually informed about it -- they turn to genealogy, seeing as they have the same name, might they not be related?  hisname writes, "alistar came here in 1737 from the palatine area of germany via rotterdam and settled in philadelphia. they later left pa, going first to indiana, then to oklahoma which is where my great grandfather settled. i had long talks with his daughter, portia; she was three when they drove their covered wagon and nine cattle to buffalo, ok."   (aside: is it just a given that, once you reach a certain age, you become interested in genealogy?)  after a few emails like this, the boy and hisname decide to start a club, the HisNameClubofAmerica or some shit, and hisname's wife, who is a calligrapher, starts working on a logo for them.  and this is the point at which i've sort of had enough. there are certain things in life that just aren't supposed to happen, certain people that you just aren't supposed to meet. sometimes, fate takes a wrong turn and needs a little guidance.  so i compose an apology.   dear hisname,  let me first apologize for my misdirected mails, and thank you for forwarding them on to his_name for me. i appreciate that.  i have to admit to a special brand of embarrassment. to be quite honest, i've long been a fan of your work. when you first patented the method of attaching the soluble form of the rh antigen to flailing blood cells, i was floored. to this day, when i read your paper on raccoon blood chromosomes and types, i get so hot, so, so hot, you have no idea.  accident or not, i'm glad we met. i've had one hisname, maybe someday i can have a second...if you know what i mean.  best, feisty chick   and that's the end of a burgeoning friendship between two people with the same name who fate should have  never  brought together.

       friday night , after working late, the boy and i went out to eat at a little indian restaurant down the street. apparently, we eat there a lot, because the owner asked us to go online and fill out some positive user reviews on restaurant sites, but we forgot right after he asked. when we got home, me, the boy, and his roommate played some poker. as is to be expected, i won. i don't know why, but when i play cards, i go for the boy's throat. i'll put him all-in whenever i can, and it just isn't nice.   saturday  i woke up thinking it was late, but it was really only 10 am. i had a bunch of prep work to do for this west coast josh groban concert i had to "cover" for work. i did that for a few hours, then made terrible pancakes that were still uncooked batter on the inside. the boy ended up eating them (THEY WERE  NOT  DELICIOUS). bored, we wandered down to georgetown, where i fell in love with a gray puma track jacket, price tag $55. too steep; it was not purchased. we eventually wandered back to my place, where we played racquetball, during the course of which i somewhat injured my thumb (left thumb hit by right hand swinging racquet, blood was involved), then out to dinner, then played a little poker, this time against unknowing online folks who had no idea we were in the same room telling each other what we'd folded after we'd folded. it's a small percentage, but  still .   sunday , the boy got up at six a.m. and went golfing. do you hear that? six a.m. that's earlier than we get up for work. i slept late, then cleaned, he came home really smelly, showered, then we went to see  anchorman , which, i wanted to like, but it had such an obvious lack of plot that i just couldn't bring myself to, however funny steven colbert was (that  was  steven colbert, right? who is steven carell?). it was just thin. i got a little irritated during the jack black cameo, not so much about the cruelty to animals, which i actually -- surprisingly -- laughed at, but because the woman behind us brought three ten-year-olds to the movie, all of which started to cry at that point. after the movie, there was more racquetball and some swimming, then a pizza arrived, and afterward the boy left. and then i worked this josh groban bs, and now i'll probably go to bed. lame. the best part is, i get to skip work on  monday . i might get a manicure before attending the first ever bimonthly Girls Poker Night, where all the attendees dress up like celebrities. i'm going as jlo, so i'm thinking a manicure and a big fake diamond are a must.  p.s. here is something i don't understand: street vendors selling purses. are they stolen purses? imitation? pretend? nothing like the designer originals? i don't get it. i just got that awesome new blue purse you see over my shoulder...but a pink prada bag is tempting. if it's real. or stolen. in fact, only  if  it's stolen.

      i spent the weekend in a small maryland harbor town, celebrating in beautiful style the engagement of a pair of spectacular friends, with boating and a pretty candle-lit tent and fresh-cut flowers, and just absolute breathtaking and lovely gorgeousness.&nbsp; &nbsp; after the party ended and families had left, we took a jitney to a super-packed bar, where we did shot after shot and danced to a reggae bank until closing time, when we realized it was pouring rain outside and we were going to have to walk home in the pouring, pouring rain, in our dresses and ties and white pants and michael kors shoes. &nbsp; halfway along, walking past darkened homes, we gave up. we stripped down to underwear and splashed in puddles -- all except the boy, who found a discarded bike in the street, and began riding it in circles around us like the wicked witch of the west, carrying all our clothes and shoes in the bike's front basket -- and then we broke into a private suite at a swanky hotel, bonded in the jacuzzi until one of the sleeping guests woke up and tossed our asses out of the hotel, but then we simply broke back in and swam in the pool in the pouring rain as lightning flashed overhead. there is photographic evidence of the entire evening in existence, but i have no doubt the photos will be destroyed very soon.

      it' s a struggle to keep myself from walking up to the boy, grabbing his crotch, and asking, "this thing got a hemi?"
