      Today was really an eye opener.  Working for Champion Sports Wear was a unique experience. In terms of working with ppl and in terms of getting to know puneites (as i am from delhi). The work itself was not that informative, but the people whom i spoke to made it interesting. eg i spoke to Sachin, who had been working there for the past 10-12 years and was the head of the childrens department. Never once had the thought of settling in Mumbai crossed his mind  - even though he was so close to it.  The shop itself, was started about 40 years ago by Subash Madan  (020 31013490)and today has his brothers, son's and nephews are running it and have expanded from one shop (4014118) to three shops (two in Deccan Road and one in Camp) and has also expoanded from sports wear to  include exercise equipment and accessories.His daily average turnover is about 30,000 -35,000 with about 20%-25% profit margin.  The most admirable quality about Mr. Madan was his down to earth attitude.The fact that he listened and took me in proves this.  Even though i have about one year of work experience in Citicorp, this is the first time i had the oppurtunity to meet a self made man. Someone who started something because he wanted to be different.   I  just hope that he is not the last.
