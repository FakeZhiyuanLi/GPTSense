      ok, so first off i have to talk about last nite. i hate stupid ppl. i hate mean ppl. and i hate pyscho ppl. so last nite i am talkin to one of these ppl and omg he is such an asshole i cant even explain how much i wanted to hit him in the face. so anyways, he was bein very mean to me and i am already very touchy right now anyways, i think its cuz i havent smoked in 8 freekin days. omg its only been 8 days? so anyways yea i am on the edge and he put me in an even worse mood so i totally like bitched out my sis last nite and she was like wtf mandy. but yea anyways movin on, today was our first day of part tryouts in choir. i hate this part of the year. bein that i am in mixed choir, there are guys in my class and omg omg omg, they just sit behind on the stairs and watch while the girls go. what u do is all stand in a circle and take turns singing BY URSELF. and i hate singing in front of ppl alone anyways, but all the guys just listen and i get all nervous and screw up everytime, i think i did ok this time, but yea we have ot finish tomorrow, and i cant wait till its like over. they can never find a part 4 me either, every year they r just like mandy since u have such a wide range, just go were we need ppl. and so i am always like the center of attention and everyone is like let me hear u sing really high and im just like no. so yea that is how the beginning of the year with choir goes. and on other news, my friend isnt mad at me anymore we talked today and were good now. then their is other problems that i am dealing with that i wont talk about online cuz i dont wanna bore u guys with all my shit so ill go eat lions choice now and then come back later and chat with y'all.

      omg i had the WORST day ever today!!!  i just wanted to hit someone.  ok, so all during work was hella boring cuz we werent busy at all and brad didnt come in till 12 so i had no one to play with.  and then while im at work, my mom calls me and asks me to pick up something from the store.  so i hate goin out in public in my work clothes. and so does my sis, well my sis was like omg i dont wanna do it, and she was bein such a bitch about it.  so we finally get to the store, and me and my sis start fighting and stuff, and i am so pissed, and then it is also very very very bad for me to drive hen im angry. omg i was doin like 70 on baxter on the way home, and i had my music on all the way to block out my sis.  and then i figured out that my checking account is prolly gonna bounce cuz i thought i had more money in there then i really did and i have written way to many checks, and then i figured out that today is sunday and i have to go back to fuckin school tomorrow and i still havent even done my homework from this weekend, i am soooo stressed right now and i just need time to stop and i need to just sit and have a break from the world.
