In addition to this, Ton, Jer, Jas and I went to the zoo... yay.. bleh.. it was fun but my joints hurt (yes, I'm getting old).. we Metro Surfed (standing up on the MetroLink instead of sitting down and not holding on to anything- good times), got quartz crystals that would have cost us a bloody fortune elsewhere, meandered around the bird house (found a really cool bird- the Superb Starling- shockingly blue with a red chest and brilliant yellow eyes.. he kept chirping at me and hopping up to my side of the cage when I'd whistle at him... hehe.. he's a cutie.. lol.. what? I love birds..) and then crashed on the Metro on the way home... at home I tried some sushi *an aquired taste to find out.. I can only stand so much before the seaweed gets to me.. bleh*  and now I'm sitting here waiting for 11 ish to roll around so I can talk to Mr. J... (we talked today about our relationship- which caused him to cry.. I hate it when I do that.. makes me want to cry.. I feel like such a rat.. ee.. sucks bigtime- so I hope to be able to cuddle with him to make up for it.. ) ((sighs)) sorry about the disjointedness of this post.. I'm tired and want to go back to my book   The Kite Rider .. it's interesting..  Down Blanket Wishes and Cappuchino Dreams, ~Megs

        Ade, I know this isnt going to come as quite of a shock to you, and I'm sorry you have to hear about things like this if it offends you..really.. any quesitons, email me, k's?   Since I was about ten years old, I've delved into the world of naturalistic religions and things typically associated with them.. (My parents allowed my brother and I both to find a religion that best suited our souls.. what just felt right to us - granted, of course, that we could legitimately defend it. We couldnt use the excuse 'well, everyone's doing it'.. which is perfectly legitimate and a rule I respect completely).. and for a time, I put these religions aside to research others... none of which, however, quite felt like home.. but an Old Religion -commonly called "Green Witchcraft" by some, although many frown heavily upon the term 'witchcraft' purely for the fact that movies and other media *children's stories, books, etc* have painted a certain picture of it..  although, most involved in this religion tend towards positive things- it's a common rule to 'harm none- fits like a glove.. Thus, I've decided to do a semi-dedication to the green aspect of Wicca.. *non-formal is more my style.. just to get a sense of being complete.. not a fancy show for everyone.. I dont want to be part of a coven anyway.. solitary seems to be more my thing.. although, I dont mind coming together with friends during celebrations like Litha and Beltaine, I dont want this to be for everyone else..* Some things  have  been bothering me though... Alot of people here- and where I've been to be honest- really dont approve of Wicca.. or anything besides the 'mainstream religions'... I just dont want to upset an angry Podotian mob by mistake... it's sad.. I cant even feel comfortable practicing a religion that I feel close to. I'm not forcing other people to believe what I do.. I'm not dancing naked in my back yard under a full moon *sounds fun lol.. kidding.. it isnt even done in most extreme covens anymore..* I'm not even going on the 'dramatic' side of things- a few of the small group of Podotian Wiccans  are extremely proud of what/who they are.. and I wish I could be that way.. they wear all of their symbols proudly (pentacles *luck and fufillment, btw*, ankhs, celtic crosses, Isis pendants, etc..) and all I tend to wear is my Gypsy bell anklet and a Green Man pendant.. (Pagan God- counterpart to the Green Lady *Goddess* ).. Things are just incredibly different here in Podot- if you say anything people make death threats.. (not kidding- someone here heard that a friend was Wiccan and wanted to know who she was so he could 'beat the snot out of her'... its sad)... ((sighs)) I just wish I could practice without people looking at me like I've grown three heads.. I've always believed in what I do.. I just have a name for it now....  ~Megs

      The other day Mr. J and I were laying in on the couch, just enjoying eachother's company before eating a dinner of my mum's infamous home made nachos and hopping off for a show in Bllvlle, a town about 20 min away from Podot... Throughout the past month or so we've been so busy with jobs, friends and other potentially hectic things, that I havent really gotten to participate in my favorite past time in a while- staring at him.. he's beautiful.. and I love looking at him.. some dont really tend to look past the facades he's put up.. but he really is.. I never really noticed untill now how perfectly he's built.. strong, but not too strong.. he's lean, but under all of that there's a startling strength.. like a panther almost.. and has beautiful skin.. its startling once you look past the slightly geeky facade he likes to keep up at all times to ward off people.. I also noticed his eyes.. I've noticed them before, but I havent gotten the chance to just sit there and stare into them in a while.. they really are beautifull.. a wonderful, ever-changing brownish green.. or is it greenish brown?.. I can never tell.. they're just beautiful.. more striking is the look in his eyes when he looks at me... (I never really noticed it untill now, though, to be honest..I suppose I just wasnt looking..) its so incredibly loving.. and happy... he gets the same look in his eyes when he makes me laugh.. or when I amuse him.. they just light up.. he says he enjoys making me laugh.. and thats all he wants to do- be with me and make me laugh.. for as long as he possibly can... despite the fact that I can be an uber scary biotch from the black lagoon and have an odd combination of fears: abandonment and commitment at the same time.. although, I suppose the commitment shtick didnt come about untill I fully felt the grasp of the abandonment thing.. most people dont tend to stick around and I've learned to harden myself against it.. I mean, c'mon, there has to be something wrong with me for boyfriends and friends alike to leave so frequently.. then again, that could also be me pushing them away anymore.. ((Sighs)) I can be such an ass to him... when I look into his eyes, and even just looking at his mannerisms, I can tell that he truly loves me.. and he wants to make me happy.. and, despite my fears, I want to do the same for him.. but I dont know how.. sometimes my moods get so out of wack that I snap at him.. and I, sometimes intentionally, make him feel like less than he is.. and he  doesnt  diserve that.. at all.. I love him.. and I really need to learn how to show it... ((sighs)).. he's so incredible.. more so than I could have ever hoped for.. it's strange.. I never thought I'd want to stick around for anyone because no one will stick around for me (leave before being left theory).. and here I am wanting nothing more than to be with him.. today, tomorrow, and perhaps even further on down the road- who knows?... all I know is that, when I'm with him, nothing matters.. at all.. I love laying with my head on his chest and listening to his heart beat.. it's a simple pleasure.. but it's so incredibly amazing none the less..

       ((sighs frustratedly)) ..  as the title so aptly states- Grr-ness of doom.... Mr. J popped over this morning before he had to go to work and we were canoodling on the couch (minor kissing and I was tweaking his leg hair to get his attention- the usual tame stuff) when my brother waltzes in and says "oh for the love of god I really dont need to see that".. not so bad.. it was embarassing as hell though, considering Mr. J dislike doing things on the off chance that we'll get caught (I mean, c'mon, what person enjoys having another person, let alone a family member, walk in on them??? it's weird and we try to steer clear of it) I immediately hid my face and said "i'm just going to crawl up under the ottoman and die now if you dont mind".. which my brother chuckled at... a few minutes later, though, the shmuck and my mother pulled me into the kitchen (which, mind you, you can still hear EVERY freakin word- the rooms downstairs arent exactly soundproof- duh) to chew me out about it.. saying i was a whore, and that i had no respect for them.. that I actually thought it was funny..   hell no. those words never left my mouth   grr.. it just irritates me that she a) calls me a whore, when, if she actually took the time to talk to me in the days we've had to spend together instead of avoiding me like the bubonic plague, she'd know that I'm not and Mr. J and I talk about not going further than we have because its too soon and neither of us are ready.. period.. end of story.. we're not that stupid.. and what's more, I've told her that I'd talk to her about it prior to doing anything of that sort.. which, if you ask most teenagers, isnt exactly common place.. and b) has the nerve to just barge in while I'm trying to explain myself (not give excuses mind you- it was wrong and we'll tone it down.. both for their sake and ours) to tell me that I dont respect her or this family.. well, how can I when  they  dont respect me??? I mean, they always sit there and tell me that I cant be respected untill I respect them.. I do what they ask, and what do I get? nada, zilch, a big fat goose egg... grrrrrrrr!!!!!!! Respect goes both ways.. I'm a human being and I'm not going to just blindly follow them.. A good friend of mine, Cass, once had a saying, "be blindly loyal like a dog and be prepared to be treated like one"...  ((final frustrated sight)) ..grr.. Even worse than them embarassing me though, they embarrased Mr. J.. They claim to care about him and respect him, but then she goes and yells that we're being promiscuous (which, FYI, we're not.. ) which completely insults his morals and made him feel horrible... GRR!!!   ((breathes))   sorry about that everyone, but I just needed to get it out...  ((takes a breath))  This has been a test of the emergency ranting broadcast system. This is only a test. We will now return to your regularly scheduled programming.. thank you and have a nice day..  ~Megs

         this was meant to be posted last night, but I got interrupted and had to get offline..   ((Yawns and stretches a little)) Well, I sucessfully went almost a full day before making yet another spectacular entry in my new found obsession; blog... its slighlty evil and addictive, but fun none the less.. lol.. I suppose you could say that I thoroughly enjoy having a place to just sit down, type and let everything hang loose.. a place where I can be me.. without the fear of everyone and their brother in my hometown looking into it and bombarding me over the phone the next day about what I typed... To be honest though, I'm slightly tempted to tell Mr. J about all of this blog goodness... or a number of my other friends... While it'd be a nice place for all of us to converge at the end of the day and read about one anothers thoughts, it'd also rob me of yet another place where I can just be myself.. no walls.. no barriers... ((looks out at you all.. or few)) you all dont know me.. and even if you did, I dont think you'd be able to place a face with the words which seem to spill endlessly from the tips of my constantly moving fingertips... no offence, but its not like I'm going to post a wee bitty pic of myself anytime soon.. (lol.. I hate haveing my picture taken.. I always either look like a complete and utter goob or like I just rolled out of bed, hit the wall and fell to the floor in a blanketed mess- drool abound and hair akimbo... lovely no?) anywho though, today was a semi-uneventful day in the life of the currently unemployed Ultimate Cynic Woman... I rolled out of bed this morning at about 11 (yes, I  finally  managed to roll out of bed before 1pm.. what??? its summer and I'm unemployed... give me a break here people) anywho though, being the lazy bum that I am, I pulled on my favorite pair of levis (note- so favorite it might be time to retire the poor dears... they discontinued the style though!! fuzzy shmucks... grr) and a red cami.. (ooh- lacey  and  silky... seexay.. rrrow... kididng) no makeup.. nada.. which is odd for me considering I view myself as a horrid pale mess without some sort of foundation on... ((laughs slightly)) yeah, I know, I'm odd.. but you probably already guessed that by now, havent you? In any case though, I wound up stumbling downstairs after whipping up my hair into a semi-decent bunish thing (my skills with hair are nill.. its either up or down.. always a slight mess- which is sad.. I have nice hair..) I walked outside after spying my mother standing out by our 1989 Ford Festiva and looking at our house like a psychotic rennovation nut (not saying that she isnt one or anything) to find Mr. J stumbling across the street to say hey.. heh.. he had woken up about 30 minutes before I had and was still groggy.. ahwell, he's cute when he's groggy.. all scraggly hair and brownish green eyes.. ((smiles)).. Anywho though- I feel like the uber paranoid spaz queen of the universe now.. to find out he got off at 4 yesterday as planned, and then spent time with his  family ... oy... and here I was thinking he just didnt want to say hey.. eck.. yes, I felt like a wee bit of a rat.. after that little explanation we elected to go on a quickie bikeride to the store and back for green onions..nearly collided a couple of times, but it was fun.. he then went to work and I lounged about the house for the rest of the day untill I decided to go on another bikeride before he got home from work.. ((smiles)) come to find out, there arent many streets in Podot.. I wound up going down many of them twice.. it's sad.. really really sad.. it was nice though- being out on my own and being able to decide where I wanted to go by myself.. mostly on a whim.. at about 10ish Mr. J got home and we spent the rest of the night on the couch watching cartoons (one of the many things I love about him- 10, 15, 20 years from now I know that when I walk into the living room in the mornings, I'll find him on the couch watching cartoons and eating a bowl of cereal..I love the fact that, while he knows when to be serious, he also isnt afraid to still be a kid at heart) he wound up going home at 11ish (an hour- I know... but to find out you can do alot in an hour.. ((smiles)).. man alive.. lol.. no, I'm not telling you what we did- I'll leave it to your imagination) ((yawns slightly and stretches again)) overall though, it was a pretty good day.. ((looks up at the entry)) eck.. this is getting long and I have to be hopping... sorry about the babbling.. ~Megs

          ((sighs)) ... Has anyone ever noticed that A) this blog shtick is quite addicting and B) just when you think everything in life is going peachy, karma comes back to laugh maniacally in your face despite the fact that your daily good deeds outweigh your bad? ((props head up on hand and looks at you))... I suppose I should describe a wee bit about myself before launching into this entry, though... how rude of me to babble long before I introduce myself...  As you can tell from my previous entries, my name is Meg, and I seem to live a very bored and highly uninteresting life at the moment { c'mon.. who else posts 3 times in a night? } I moved from my semi-native home of Eielson AFB, Alaska about two years ago to the one-streetlighted town of Podot, USA.. middle of the midwest.. yay for me.. Anywho though, since moving to this wee little town (Podot is the kind of place that, if you sneezed while driving, you'd pass it up completely) I've not only found a more cynical, sarcastic side to my otherwise outgoing personality (hence the title 'Ultimate Cynic Woman'... bow in homage.. kidding.. if you want to though, yay! I have more victims... er.. followers.. hehe..) but also joined my town's Winterguard Troupe *yes, you people out there.. I'm still a lowly highschooler* and found an absolutely amazing man.. we shall call him Mistah J, master of spider squishing for his uber-aracnaphobic girlfriend, and keeper of all things squishy.. (Mr. J will do though) thus far he hasnt run screaming for the cornfeilds yet, and has stuck around for a whopping four and a half months.. (I said it was the midwest... we dont have hills.. just cornfeilds.. its sad) Besides all that, superficially speaking, I'm a pretty average chick *with exception to my height*.. I come in at a rather petite 4'11", with blue/green eyes and ever-changing reddish hair (that reminds me- note to self- dye hair.. again..)  Moving on to the key subject of my entry today- Mr. J-  ((sighs))  Simply put, he said he got off work at 4pm... it's 11:05pm.... we usually meet up after he gets off work because he tends spend his daytime hours working on his car and flipping burgers at the local McDonalds *dont worry- just a temporary job.. he plans on going into aeronautical mechanics.. yes, we're  both  in high school... gasp..* and I tend to spend my daytime hours bumming around the house and hoping a job will miraculously fall into my lap.. (hey, atleast I'm kinda looking.. ish..not really..) In any case though, we meet up and talk to one another during the few hours we can actually be together... end of work till about midnightish... unfortunately though, he's not here... and instead of talking to him, I'm on Blog babbling about him not being here.. again... yes, I am odd.. and have probably irritated you all ((maniacal laugh)) ahem.. sorry.. In any case though, I have to be hopping... perhaps he'll decide to come over... perhaps..  here's to wishing  ~Megs the odd Irish chick who is insanely odd when alone at night..

       Tentatively Titled- "Breathless"      ((She smiles and sighs gently, intertwining her fingers softly with those of the man who has so nonchalantly laid claim on her once shattered but still entirely too fragile heart. Standing there, souls interlacing, hearts beating louder and faster than the thunderous hooves of a thousand wild horses as they race gracefully across the fields, the entire world seems to stop its eternal wanderings, and gently comes to rest on the tranquil pair who stand silently in the shimmering moonlight. Her hair, blowing gently in the icy cold night, brushes across her seemingly fragile porcelain skin and momentarily blocks her silver-blue eyes from his sight. With an equally gentle movement, he reaches up with one incredibly strong but beautiful hand and brushes the silken strands from her eyes, revealing a gaze so warm and loving, it makes the very sun burn and seethe with complete and utter jealousy. In her heart, however, an infinitesimally small fear still lingers; the fear of her inadequacy... her inability to love after the utter torments of past loves have left her torn and broken... a fear that lingers in the dark and desolate corners of her mind despite the sheer beauty and tenderness of his eyes... his touch... of his very soul... In a single moment, however, these fears are scattered to the ever-turning winds of time and fate, as he tenderly runs his fingers over the soft skin of her cheek, and leans to kiss her with a passion that's as warm and gentle as a summer's breeze... In that moment her fears no longer exist... her heart is finally complete… and in the sheer beauty of that moment, which is entirely too brief, he has succeeded a thousand times over in leaving her completely and utterly...   breathless....  ))

        This was an entry that I was going to post in my TOD, but the thing is being a royal pain in the arse... sorry to start this out on such a heavy note, but ah well.. ((small shrug))   very few people… with the exception of a select few (you know who you are).. already know to some extent what this entry is going to be about… although, no one, not even the few who know, know everything about what I have to say… I know I probably sound like a hardcore nutcase right now, and, after this, will probably lose a lot of people I consider friends… but this is my choice.. people would have to know at some point in time... ((sighs)) just please.. bear with me people and hear me out completely before leaving uber worried notes.. this entry isn't about pity, attention, or worry.. I just want to get something off my chest that's been weighing me down for quite a while now…  I was randomly hunting around TOD today, bored out of my mind and trying to find something to do to keep myself occupied (my uncle is here and I don’t particularly have anything to say to him… sorry, but we're not exactly close..) and I happened upon the diary of a cutter… these diaries, as anyone who's been using TOD for a while knows, are extremely common…but something about this dairy made me want to say something… more specifically, it was a couple of quotes I found that really made me think- "Self injury is not a way to die, but more an attempt to stay alive" …I'm not condoning the usage of cutting as a method of gaining some sort of control over one's life, don’t get me wrong… all I'm saying, is that I related to this quote.. I've been cutting since my eighth grade year.. most of you probably know about it, and I'm sorry if I'm stating the obvious, but I need to get it out… cutting for me has never been something light or easy.. some say that cutting just comes naturally and that it's a simple cry for attention.. I beg to differ.. I first saw what cutting was long before I actually knew that there was a term for it.. a close friend of mine began it as a method of coping with boyfriend problems… and, at the time, I thought it was a little disturbing and worrisome.. but another, deeper part of me thought 'what if..'  after a time I forgot about cutting and continued to talk to people about my problems in a rather free manner… eventually, however, I began to realize that all I was doing was burdening other people with my simple problems… and I didn’t want to do that.. my entire life, I had been taught not to unload things on other people because a lot of people have it so much worse than I do.. which is true… in comparison, I have things extremely easy… my parents support me, they've never been divorced, my brother and I get along at times, and I have a couple of close friends… I have no room to say I have it bad.. I don’t.. but some things… just get  to me, to put it simply… Unlike my friend, I didn’t start cutting because of boyfriend problems… I began doing SI *self injury* as a way to escape my family… my mom more specifically.. don’t get me wrong, I love my mother… but there are times in my life when I've just wanted to simply cease to exist if it would please her… every time we have ever fought, she has felt the need to bring up the fact that she wanted to have a little girl so badly.. (my parents tried for about a year to have me).. and went through some hard times in the process… although she never completes this statement, some small part of my mind always returns to the same thing 'you tried to hard to have a second child and all you got was me' its an extremely self-depreciating comment, but I cant help but think that somewhere in her mind she thinks this thought everyday of her life… returning to the quote though, many people think that SI is a way to simply cry out.. and in a lot of ways it is.. (although, it's become so common now that very few people actually say something to stop it..) thinking back on it, all of my cutting seems to have been a way to tell my mother that I was sorry for being such a disappointment.. for being a loser, a dreamer, a whore.. (all of which she's told me I am) a way to kill a part of myself that I've never been proud of…in other ways though, SI has always been not a way to die, but a way to get from point A *depression, pain, angst, etc* to point B *happiness, contentment, etc*.. many people, myself included, don’t know how to get between these two points without unloading problems on other people.. without being a burden.. often times people who don’t cut say that cutters should find a healthy outlet… drawing, writing, singing, etc.. and, for many circumstances, I use these but, as many can attest, sometimes this doesn’t work… these feelings simply become bottled up inside until there's no room left for feeling.. and everything explodes…and in exploding, you take the risk of hurting other people… personally, this has never been my goal… I don’t want to hurt other people in the process of making myself feel better… ever…I have a very loving boyfriend and several friends who care that I cut… but I've never wanted them to know that I hurt this badly… I've never wanted them to worry…  so I found a method of erupting silently… something that seemed to affect no one… I began to cut… every time my mother would scream at me that she could no longer stand the sight of me and that I was absolutely worthless, I'd retreat to some solitude, grab whatever I could find and press it against my skin… as sick as this sounds… cutting has become one of my only outlets… in cutting, I can focus on another pain besides whatever pain I’m feeling inside.. it helps at the time,  but afterward, I’m left with the responsibility and burden of  bandaging and hiding the wound… initially I had to think about how I was going to relieve internal pain… but as of late, I'm sorry to say that it's become a bit of a reflex… the bandaging and hiding have become just another element of pretending I’m absolutely okay… many people who don’t cut also seem to think that many cutters simply don’t want to stop their cries for attention… but, again, a lot of the time, this isn't true… personally, I'd love to stop cutting… I'd absolutely love to be able to wake up one day and instantly know what to do when something bad happens… but I cant… I've tried for the past two years to stop cutting… and I'd be so incredibly proud when I could say that I hadn't cut for a month or so… but as soon as something would happen that was bad enough to make me want to stop breathing, I'd go back to it… I'm not saying that I don’t know what to do instead of cutting.. sadly, I do..  but when push comes to shove, it all comes down to the fact that these have always been my problems… my mother, my family, my life.. why should anyone else ever have to deal with my problems?.. they're mine and I have to deal with them, as simple or as difficult as they may be… and cutting has always been a silent way of packing everything down into that tiny emotional bottle.. when things feel as if they're going to erupt, I cut… In essence people, I'm sorry… again, I'm not condoning cutting… I actually really rather dislike it… and don’t want anyone else to go down this road.. it's addicting simply put… and can ruin your life… I'll always have scars and I'll eventually have to face explaining to my husband and children their meaning… but until then, all I can do is try to stop… I’m not guaranteeing that it'll ever happen but I can try… unfortunately, though, I seem to be in deeper than I had originally thought…
