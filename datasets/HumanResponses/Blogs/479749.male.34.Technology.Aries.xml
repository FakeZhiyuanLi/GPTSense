      New blog which i'm hoping will be easier to maintain between my home and work comupters. So where is the story so far?  - 33 years old  - Married 3 years - First son born on April 29 which is also my wedding day - work as a software quality analyst at a large library collective - Dad died Dec 12, 2002 at age 54  - estanged from Mom, Sister and brother in-law over money  And that's about it from the 100,000 foot view. Of course things get stickier the closer you get to the surface.

       urlLink My Way News : "Red Lobster to Trim All-You-Can-Eat Deals"  I've seen my Dad flat out break the back of the wait staff on "crab Monday" when Jean and I were dating.   See Jean was a waitron at the Lobster in college and taught my Dad the proper way to chuck the crab legs. I think they pounded down close to 5 pounds before my Dad started to wonder aloud if he was starting to feel the effect of his shellfish allergy.. Needless to say Pop's spent the night at the ER and Mom forbid him from eating crabs ever again.   During my Dad's showing when my Mom and Sister didn't invite us to go to dinner with them, I looked at Jean and said "We're going to the Lobster" since that was the one place I knew they wouldn't go that Dad would have liked to have had one last time.

      Wonderfalls Funniest show I've seen on a network in years. Jayne works at a gift shop at Niagara Falls. She's a cynic and strives to disappoint her very successful family. But she has a problem, things like a deformed wax lion are now talking to her and urging her to get involved in people's lives.   Exchange of the night: (the setting, Jayne is driving, her sister Sharon is in the back seat. Sharon has just come out of the closet after Jayne (who hates her) tried to set her up on a blind date with a guy.. who by the way is also in the back seat struggling to breath after eating peanuts. Yes their taking him to the hospital.   Also the reason she tried to set them up was that the deformed wax lion kept her up all night singing until Jayne 'finds a mate' for the guy who's gasping for air in the back)  Jaye: Your Gay? Sharon: Yes Jaye: Does Mom know? Sharon: No, she'd unwind Jaye: Can I tell her?   urlLink FOX Broadcasting Company: WONDERFALLS

      Got this from one of the guys at work.. Will be interested to see which one Cheney will pick..  http://atrios.blogspot.com/2004_03_21_atrios_archive.html#107999847741730837  Out of the Loop   Moe Blues over at Bad Attitudes has the best take on Cheney's bizarre appearance on Big Pharma's show:   So Dick Cheney is making the rounds claiming that Clarke was "out of the loop" in the administration's counter-terror efforts. Therefore, Clarke doesn't know what he's talking about and anything he says should be instantly discounted.  It's amazing that Cheney does not seem to realize what he is actually saying: That the Bush administration's top expert on terrorism was not consulted about their counter-terrorism efforts. This presents several unpalatable choices:  1. Cheney is lying for political gain. If the public picks up on this, the backlash could be out of all proportion to the damage Cheney is trying to control.  2. The administration deliberately ignored its in-house expert, with September 11 being the result. This eliminates one more scapegoat, since the White House cannot simultaneously blame Clarke for failing to stop 9/11 while claiming he was "out of the loop" on counter-terrorism.  3. Assuming Cheney speaks the truth, it actually bolsters Clarke's claim to Cassandra-hood. Cut out of the loop, his warnings went nowhere and were ignored. That, too, is pretty damning of the administration.

OK, while I like Keira a lot, she's a bit too young unless it's a reto Bond set in the 60's (an idea I really, really like). Brittany would also work in a very small roll, with no lines..  Monica Bellucci would be a PERFECT choice to be the first Woman Bond villain. Not henchwoman or mistress but the full fledge Bad Woman Bond would have to take on.

      It is sad to rad such words as former diplomat Kiesling: The policies we are now asked to advance are incompatible not only with American values but also with American interests. Our fervent pursuit of war with Iraq is driving us to squander the international legitimacy that has been America’s most potent weapon of both offense and defense since the days of Woodrow Wilson. We have begun to dismantle the largest and most effective web of international relationships the world has ever known. Our current course will bring instability and danger, not security.    urlLink U.S. Diplomat's Letter of Resignation

      Oh that must have been a fun meeting. It's sad that while NPR tries to figure out the grant from Mrs. Krock, the member stations are suffering the backlash the timing of this move has caused.   I mean, I stopped giving to my station, WCBE, since it's broadcast license is held by the cash strapped and missmanaged Columbus Board of Education. They have cut 'CBE's budget to nothing (which I can understand) but as the holder of the broadcast rights for that FM signal, they could just up and sell it without any imput from me since I live in Gahanna (about 3 miles from the Columbus line).   urlLink Stormy days for NPR : " Kernis and Edwards have known each other since both were in their 20s, building the collaborative intimacy the studio fosters; Kernis was Edwards producer when Morning Edition was just starting in 1979.       That long history adds poignancy to Kernis role as the one who decided Edwards� fate.       Kernis stressed how he's been long devoted to Edwards. Edwards speaks of Kernis as his former producer, pushing me to try things I didn't want to do. A picture of the men together in the old days hangs in Edwards' office. Yet, recalling the meeting that marked the end as public radio's leading morning presence, Edwards said: "You don't do this to your friend."       "He may be right, he may be right, Kernis said, his voice trailing off. But I still have enormous affection for him."       Asked if this was a painful thing for him to do, Kernis said: "I can tell you it was difficult."       "Oh, great, said Edwards, with his typical wry wit. "He got the difficulty and I got the pain. Wanna trade ? "

       I was flipping channels for background noise and heard part of a talk by Karen Armstrong about her new book, THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE: MY CLIMB OUT OF DARKNESS. She had some interesting quotes:  "I like to considered myself a freelance mono theist"  "I hate the term 'teach tolerance'. It as if you have to put up with them. We should try 'teach compassion and understanding'."  Here's a link to the talk: http://www.booktv.org/PublicLives/index.asp?schedid=259&segid=4425  From Union Theological Seminary in New York City, Karen Armstrong discusses her new memoir, "The Spiral Staircase: My Climb Out of Darkness." Karen Armstrong became a nun at the age of 17, but left the convent seven years later, in 1969. She went on to write several books on religious subjects, including "A History of God," "The Battle for God: A History of Fundamentalism," "Islam: A Short History," and "Buddha." "The Spiral Staircase" tells the story of her personal search for God and for her place in the world in the years after she left the convent.

      This would have been the opening of my assignment but I'm afrade that it would get dinged as fluf:  Author’s preamble: The impact of war upon a people is difficult to understand. For the historian, impact of war on a nation or a region can be effectively measured in many different ways. A few of these measures are the redrawing of boarders, the rise and fall of governments, the building and shattering of alliances. Yet when the historian seeks to measurer the cost of war on a culture, little is left. What is left tends to be either a statistical record of the people (such as the number of people who died or left the area) or a global statement such as “they once spoke “A” but after years of post war occupation now speak “B”’. Such measures do little in the way of teaching us about the individual lives and a people’s culture that have been forever impacted.

More recently, amateur "camgirls" have used cheap webcams and broadband connections to broadcast performances from their own bedrooms.   Now comes subservientchicken.com, a website that mimics the look of an Internet sexcam show to promote a new chicken sandwich from Burger King.   Instead of starring a busty young woman or a porn stud with rock-hard abs, the Flash-powered site features an actor in a chicken suit, dressed in lingerie.

      I've come to love Powell since he, Richard Armitage and Larry Wilkerson are the only sane people in the Bush White House.    After escorting the minister to his car, Powell returned to the microphones. "Anybody else wants to dipstick me?" he asked. "Give me a break. Come on, guys."    urlLink washingtonpost.com: Magazine Article Raises New Questions About Powell's Role   Magazine Article Raises New Questions About Powell's Role    By Glenn Kessler Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, May 6, 2004; Page A27    For the second time in a month, the State Department yesterday found itself fending off questions about Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's role in the Bush administration, after some of his top aides gave interviews to GQ magazine suggesting he was frustrated and isolated.  Three weeks ago, the release of Bob Woodward's "Plan of Attack" prompted similar questions, but that book about the administration's planning for the Iraq war was based largely on interviews with unnamed sources. What is striking about the GQ account is that everyone was quoted by name, including Powell and two of his closest advisers and friends, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage and chief of staff Lawrence Wilkerson, as well as his mentor from the National War College, Harlan Ullman.  Powell's quotes generally were run-of-the-mill and upbeat -- though he may have raised diplomatic hackles by referring to an island that nearly led to war between Spain and Morocco as a "little stupid island" -- but his allies painted a much different picture.   "This is, in many ways, the most ideological administration Powell's ever had to work for," Ullman told the magazine. "Not only is it very ideological, but they have a vision. And I think Powell is inherently uncomfortable with grand visions like that."  Wilkerson, who offered tart and colorful opinions on Powell adversaries such as Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, said Powell was tired "mentally and physically" and would be unlikely to stay with the administration if President Bush is reelected.   "He has spent as much time doing damage control and, shall we say, apologizing around the world for some less-than-graceful actions as he has anything else," Wilkerson said, referring to Pentagon and White House missteps.  Powell has publicly defended his 2003 speech to the U.N. Security Council, which alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that have never been found. But Armitage said that the speech was "a source of great distress for the secretary."  State Department spokesman Richard Boucher was peppered with questions at his daily briefing about the lengthy article, and he repeatedly stressed that the statements contained in it did not reflect Powell's true feelings.   "The primary source is the secretary of state," Boucher said. "As far as I'm concerned, this is the man that demonstrates the power of positive thinking, a man who knows his direction."   Boucher did not dispute the accuracy of the quotes attributed to Powell's aides, which the author, Wil S. Hylton, said he tape-recorded. But Boucher said that Wilkerson believed he was speaking "on background," meaning any quotes would not be attributed to him by name.   Hylton insisted it was clear the interview was on the record, as were almost all the conversations he had with Powell's aides. "It was really weird," he said. "I didn't have a particular hunger to interview these guys," but the State Department press aide working with him kept setting up interviews and insisting he meet with more people, he said.  Powell told reporters he had not read the article yet. "I've spent an enormous amount of time answering questions about articles and books," he said after meeting with the Bulgarian foreign minister. "It's too bad we have to spend time on these kinds of issues. Let's get on to the substance, and I don't want to answer any more questions about these kinds of things."  After escorting the minister to his car, Powell returned to the microphones. "Anybody else wants to dipstick me?" he asked. "Give me a break. Come on, guys."    © 2004 The Washington Post Company

      Like this will happen.. granted this would be the way to go but this is the administration that went to war without an exit plan, something the Sec of State called for from the start. To do what Thomas is talking about would require too much thinking.   urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Restoring Our Honor  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   e are in danger of losing something much more important than just the war in Iraq. We are in danger of losing America as an instrument of moral authority and inspiration in the world. I have never known a time in my life when America and its president were more hated around the world than today. I was just in Japan, and even young Japanese dislike us. It's no wonder that so many Americans are obsessed with the finale of the sitcom "Friends" right now. They're the only friends we have, and even they're leaving.  This administration needs to undertake a total overhaul of its Iraq policy; otherwise, it is courting a total disaster for us all.  That overhaul needs to begin with President Bush firing Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld — today, not tomorrow or next month, today. What happened in Abu Ghraib prison was, at best, a fundamental breakdown in the chain of command under Mr. Rumsfeld's authority, or, at worst, part of a deliberate policy somewhere in the military-intelligence command of sexually humiliating prisoners to soften them up for interrogation, a policy that ran amok.  Either way, the secretary of defense is ultimately responsible, and if we are going to rebuild our credibility as instruments of humanitarian values, the rule of law and democratization, in Iraq or elsewhere, Mr. Bush must hold his own defense secretary accountable. Words matter, but deeds matter more. If the Pentagon leadership ran any U.S. company with the kind of abysmal planning in this war, it would have been fired by shareholders months ago.  I know that tough interrogations are vital in a war against a merciless enemy, but outright torture, or this sexual-humiliation-for-entertainment, is abhorrent. I also know the sort of abuse that went on in Abu Ghraib prison goes on in prisons all over the Arab world every day, as it did under Saddam — without the Arab League or Al Jazeera ever saying a word about it. I know they are shameful hypocrites, but I want my country to behave better — not only because it is America, but also because the war on terrorism is a war of ideas, and to have any chance of winning we must maintain the credibility of our ideas.  We were hit on 9/11 by people who believed hateful ideas — ideas too often endorsed by some of their own spiritual leaders and educators back home. We cannot win a war of ideas against such people by ourselves. Only Arabs and Muslims can. What we could do — and this was the only legitimate rationale for this war — was try to help Iraqis create a progressive context in the heart of the Arab-Muslim world where that war of ideas could be fought out.  But it is hard to partner with someone when you become so radioactive no one wants to stand next to you. We have to restore some sense of partnership with the world if we are going to successfully partner with Iraqis.   Mr. Bush needs to invite to Camp David the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, the heads of both NATO and the U.N., and the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria. There, he needs to eat crow, apologize for his mistakes and make clear that he is turning a new page. Second, he needs to explain that we are losing in Iraq, and if we continue to lose the U.S. public will eventually demand that we quit Iraq, and it will then become Afghanistan-on-steroids, which will threaten everyone. Third, he needs to say he will be guided by the U.N. in forming the new caretaker government in Baghdad. And fourth, he needs to explain that he is ready to listen to everyone's ideas about how to expand our force in Iraq, and have it work under a new U.N. mandate, so it will have the legitimacy it needs to crush any uprisings against the interim Iraqi government and oversee elections — and then leave when appropriate. And he needs to urge them all to join in.  Let's not lose sight of something — as bad as things look in Iraq, it is not yet lost, for one big reason: America's aspirations for Iraq and those of the Iraqi silent majority, particularly Shiites and Kurds, are still aligned. We both want Iraqi self-rule and then free elections. That overlap of interests, however clouded, can still salvage something decent from this war — if the Bush team can finally screw up the courage to admit its failures and dramatically change course.  Yes, the hour is late, but as long as there's a glimmer of hope that this Bush team will do the right thing, we must insist on it, because America's role in the world is too precious — to America and to the rest of the world — to be squandered like this.

      Last blog entry of the night.. Really.  After 6 weeks slaving in the class with the homework assignments from Hell, I thought my stress level would go down just a wee bit... So I thought wrong. John picked up an ear infection a day after his trip to the ER after he fell and whacked his mouth on Grandma Willamson's door. Kid turns one and falls apart on us. Dr. Sara hooked him up with the antis to cover the ear and to prevent something from forming in the mouth.  Also I found out my brother-in-law got popped from his gig out in MD. They had been talking about maybe heading back to Cleveland but Bob had both the gig and strong ties to the DC area which had kept them there. But with another little one on the way and no gig, it's going to be tough since his family is 3 hours away, Virginia's family is almost 8 and the cost of living sucks. Hope his passes his cert test since that will give him some marketability.  As for me, the class with the homework from Hell is over and I'm looking forward to my graphical communication class this summer which should be cake given I know at least one of the programs (preventing) that we're covering. I was going to treat myself for getting an A even while going out of town 2 of the six weeks to getting the DVD's from season 1 of " urlLink The Protectors " but the biding got too high and I while I was in a position to pull the trigger, I just couldn't given our budget is tight and Mother's Day is coming up. So while Jean went to put John down for bed, I ran up to  urlLink ComicTown  at Easton to pick up my monthly haul of comics. The results were grim:   urlLink Previews  catalog of upcoming comics: OUT   urlLink Powers  - Law and Order except the Cops investigate superhero on super villain crime: OUT   urlLink Kiss Kiss Bang Bang  - 1/3 James Bond 1/3 Advengers 1/3 Austin Powers: OUT   urlLink Bite Club  - Vampires who run the Miami mob: Last copy. But the good news is that it came with a free poly bag and board   I was going to run to the library and pick up a book on teaching John sign language to help him communicate before he can talk but I got yipping with the manager at ComicTown about  urlLink Bendis moving to Marvel's new creator owned line this summer .  I had a creepy dream on Sunday night. The thing that might have set it off was watching a special on child actors and how in many cases their parents spent all of their money. One guy's folks put his sister thru college yet it was his money. Jean asked if this felt like my family. So that night I dreamed that I had thrown a big party at the  urlLink Ohio Theater  with food and an open bar. My parents along with my sister Ann and her Husband Doug came and invited all of their friend despite this being just for family. My Dad wasn't feeling good and left (kinda like at my rehearsal dinner) and my Mom was about to leave when I got the check for $28K. Now I knew I had $10K in the bank (how I got these numbers I don't know) but my Mom started telling me things like 'Well, you should take care of this" and "You should have not invited so many people" I couldn't say what I was feeling.. Like "I didn't invite them, you did" I woke up midway thru drinking a martini that tasted like GatorAid (remember I have a tiki bar but don't drink). Quick someone go get Sigund!  Last but no least work. My plan to use  urlLink Wiki  died a quick death. First was the harsh assestment from the Doco folks who of course saw it as a threat to all they hold near and dear. My boss liked the idea but since throwing it into our doc control system kills about, oh say, 99% of Wiki's strengths, she couldn't see upper management wanting to look at it.  The Excel spreadsheet is looking most promising but I'm not holding my breath on this. No wonder I feel like my career is at a dead end.

      A great Op-Ed on the price of war and who's childern pay for it..   urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/04/opinion/04BROY.html?th=&pagewanted=print&position=   May 4, 2004 OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR  A War for Us, Fought by Them By WILLIAM BROYLES Jr.   ILSON, Wyo. — The longest love affair of my life began with a shotgun marriage. It was the height of the Vietnam War and my student deferment had run out. Desperate not to endanger myself or to interrupt my personal plans, I wanted to avoid military service altogether. I didn't have the resourcefulness of Bill Clinton, so I couldn't figure out how to dodge the draft. I tried to escape into the National Guard, where I would be guaranteed not to be sent to war, but I lacked the connections of George W. Bush, so I couldn't slip ahead of the long waiting list. My attitude was the same as Dick Cheney's: I was special, I had "other priorities." Let other people do it.   When my draft notice came in 1968, I was relieved in a way. Although I had deep doubts about the war, I had become troubled about how I had angled to avoid military service. My classmates from high school were in the war; my classmates from college were not — exactly the dynamic that exists today. But instead of reporting for service in the Army, on a whim I joined the Marine Corps, the last place on earth I thought I belonged.   My sacrifice turned out to be minimal. I survived a year as an infantry lieutenant in Vietnam. I was not wounded; nor did I struggle for years with post-traumatic stress disorder. A long bout of survivor guilt was the price I paid. Others suffered far more, particularly those who had to serve after the war had lost all sense of purpose for the men fighting it. I like to think that in spite of my being so unwilling at first, I did some small service to my country and to that enduring love of mine, the United States Marine Corps.  To my profound surprise, the Marines did a far greater service to me. In three years I learned more about standards, commitment and yes, life, than I did in six years of university. I also learned that I had had no idea of my own limits: when I was exhausted after humping up and down jungle mountains in 100-degree heat with a 75-pound pack, terrified out of my mind, wanting only to quit, convinced I couldn't take another step, I found that in fact I could keep going for miles. And my life was put in the hands of young men I would otherwise never have met, by and large high-school dropouts, who turned out to be among the finest people I have ever known.   I am now the father of a young man who has far more character than I ever had. I joined the Marines because I had to; he signed up after college because he felt he ought to. He volunteered for an elite unit and has served in both Afghanistan and Iraq. When I see images of Americans in the war zones, I think of my son and his friends, many of whom I have come to know and deeply respect. When I opened this newspaper yesterday and read the front-page headline, "9 G.I.'s Killed," I didn't think in abstractions. I thought very personally.  The problem is, I don't see the images of or read about any of the young men and women who, as Dick Cheney and I did, have "other priorities." There are no immediate family members of any of the prime civilian planners of this war serving in it — beginning with President Bush and extending deep into the Defense Department. Only one of the 535 members of Congress, Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota, has a child in the war — and only half a dozen others have sons and daughters in the military.  The memorial service yesterday for Pat Tillman, the football star killed in Afghanistan, further points out this contrast. He remains the only professional athlete of any sport who left his privileged life during this war and turned in his play uniform for a real one. With few exceptions, the only men and women in military service are the profoundly patriotic or the economically needy.   It was not always so. In other wars, the men and women in charge made sure their family members led the way. Since 9/11, the war on terrorism has often been compared to the generational challenge of Pearl Harbor; but Franklin D. Roosevelt's sons all enlisted soon after that attack. Both of Lyndon B. Johnson's sons-in-law served in Vietnam.  This is less a matter of politics than privilege. The Democratic elites have not responded more nobly than have the Republican; it's just that the Democrats' hypocrisy is less acute. Our president's own family illustrates the loss of the sense of responsibility that once went with privilege. In three generations the Bushes have gone from war hero in World War II, to war evader in Vietnam, to none of the extended family showing up in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Pat Tillman didn't want to be singled out for having done what other patriotic Americans his age should have done. The problem is, they aren't doing it. In spite of the president's insistence that our very civilization is at stake, the privileged aren't flocking to the flag. The war is being fought by Other People's Children. The war is impersonal for the very people to whom it should be most personal.   If the children of the nation's elites were facing enemy fire without body armor, riding through gantlets of bombs in unarmored Humvees, fighting desperately in an increasingly hostile environment because of arrogant and incompetent civilian leadership, then those problems might well find faster solutions.   The men and women on active duty today — and their companions in the National Guard and the reserves — have seen their willingness, and that of their families, to make sacrifices for their country stretched thin and finally abused. Thousands of soldiers promised a one-year tour of duty have seen that promise turned into a lie. When Eric Shinseki, then the Army chief of staff, told the president that winning the war and peace in Iraq would take hundreds of thousands more troops, Mr. Bush ended his career. As a result of this and other ill-advised decisions, the war is in danger of being lost, and my beloved military is being run into the ground.   This abuse of the voluntary military cannot continue. How to ensure adequate troop levels, with a diversity of backgrounds? How to require the privileged to shoulder their fair share? In other words, how to get today's equivalents of Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney — and me — into the military, where their talents could strengthen and revive our fighting forces?   The only solution is to bring back the draft. Not since the 19th century has America fought a war that lasted longer than a week with an all-volunteer army; we can't do it now. It is simply not built for a protracted major conflict. The arguments against the draft — that a voluntary army is of higher quality, that the elites will still find a way to evade service — are bogus. In World War II we used a draft army to fight the Germans and Japanese — two of the most powerful military machines in history — and we won. The problems in the military toward the end of Vietnam were not caused by the draft; they were the result of young Americans being sent to fight and die in a war that had become a disaster.   One of the few good legacies of Vietnam is that after years of abuses we finally learned how to run the draft fairly. A strictly impartial lottery, with no deferments, can ensure that the draft intake matches military needs. Chance, not connections or clever manipulation, would determine who serves.   If this war is truly worth fighting, then the burdens of doing so should fall on all Americans. If you support this war, but assume that Pat Tillman and Other People's Children should fight it, then you are worse than a hypocrite. If it's not worth your family fighting it, then it's not worth it, period. The draft is the truest test of public support for the administration's handling of the war, which is perhaps why the administration is so dead set against bringing it back.    William Broyles Jr., the founding editor of Texas Monthly, wrote the screenplay for "Cast Away."

      John McCain is about the only person in the GOP I could vote for right now:  Sinclair Broadcast Group's decision to pre-empt Friday's edition of "Nightline," devoted to airing photographs of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq, drew a sharp rebuke from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., while non-ABC affiliates and radio stations in Sinclair markets stepped in to carry ABC's broadcast. "There is no valid reason for Sinclair to shirk its responsibility in what I assume is a very misguided attempt to prevent your viewers from completely appreciating the extraordinary sacrifices made on their behalf by Americans serving in Iraq," McCain, a decorated Vietnam veteran and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, said in a letter to Sinclair president and CEO David Smith. In a swift response to McCain's comments, Smith attacked the "Nightline" special's objectivity. " 'Nightline' is not reporting news; it is doing nothing more than making a political statement," he wrote. Sinclair prepared its own news special to replace the banned "Nightline" special "addressing what has gone on in Iraq as well as addressing (the 'Nightline' pre-emption) issue," Sinclair general counsel Barry Faber said. Following requests from KTRS-AM in St. Louis and WHNS-TV, a Fox affiliate in Greenville, to broadcast the special, ABC News on Friday made the program available to the markets affected by Sinclair's decision. Other stations that aired "Nightline" on Friday included WPXS-TV, a Pax affiliate in St. Louis; Ohio News Network; WJTC-TV, a UPN affiliate in Mobile, Ala.; the New England Cable Network; and KWBM-TV, a WB Network affiliate in Springfield, Mo.

      Pre Workout notes: My feet were bugging me today before I started my workout and they didn't feel much better after my 5 minute warm-up on the treadmill. So I opted for the stationary bike for my 20 minute cardio workout.  Treadmill 5 minutes  Stretch Shoulder pull 10 reps Shoulder pull down 10 reps (bar NEVER goes behind the head) Shoulder pull 10 reps Shoulder pull down 10 reps Bicep curl 10 reps Sit-ups 10 reps Bicep curl 10 reps Sit-ups 10 reps Stationary bike 19 minutes on level 2  		1 minute on level 3 Stretch  Post Workout notes: I was feeling OK after the workout. I was very hungry so I grabbed my lunch and headed back to my office. Then it hit me. My right knee is not happy and my arms and hands are a bit shaky. Must be due to the curls. Also just as I sat down, I got the feeling like water had gone up my nose. Sometimes I would get this feeling just before having a nose bleed. It kinda freaked me out since my Dad got a nasty nose bleed one time while I was at the hospital due in part to his blood pressure. Now I know when I have it check that my BP is fine but those family fears still have a way of sneaking up on me.   I also remembered part of the reason I stopped working out with weights. My Mom told me that my legs, arms and shoulders were getting too big and that it would be harder for me to find clothes. Just think of the power I gave to just one sentence from my Mom.  --- Posted via email

      I find it very disturbing as a Christian that communion could be withheld like this.  This quote alone upset me the most  The bishop wrote that Catholics who vote contrary to church teaching "jeopardize their salvation."    To imply that a vote contrary to Church teaching could jeopardize one's salvation is spiritual abuse. As if the Church hasn't had enough problems on its own. I wonder if the Bishop's issued any such warnings to those clergy involved in sexual abuse of their parishioners?   urlLink The New York Times > National > Bishop Would Deny Rite for Defiant Catholic Voters

I thought it was just British and Dutch dishes)  I love Bakithi Kumalo and have longed to learn his bass style.. It's so fluid and smooth. Fig is a treat on the drums. Goldberg and Cedras I don't know that well but they've got to have skills.  BAKITHI KUMALO -- Bassist, Vocalist: Grammy award winning Bakithi Kumalo gained international recognition as a featured bassist on Paul Simons Graceland album. Bakithi Kumalo has recorded and toured with several great musicians including: Gloria Estefan, Chaka Khan, Jon Secada, Harry Belafonte, Laurie Anderson, Cyndi Lauper, Grover Washington, Jr., Hugh Masekela and Paul Simon.   ANTON FIG -- Drums: Anton is presently a member of the "CBS Orchestra" appearing nightly on "The Late Show" with David Letterman. He has played with scores of great artists including Miles Davis, James Brown, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Winwood, Bonnie Raitt and Tony Bennett, Little Richard, BB King, Al Green, Gloria Estefan, In Sync and Eric Clapton, David Bowie, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, Madonna, Eric Clapton and Buddy Guy, Macy Gray, and James Taylor, as well as Sharon Katz & The Peace Trai.  MORRIS GOLDBERG -- Woodwinds, saxophone, pennywhistles: Goldberg won popular acclaim through his featured performances on Paul Simon's Graceland album, and subsequently the tour. Goldberg performed on Abdullah Ibrahim's albums and featured in Hugh Masekela's spectacular homecoming tour. Morris is currently a member of the hugely popular Rosie O'Donnell Show.   TONY CEDRAS -- Keyboards, Accordion, Vocals: Cedras is a multi-instrumental performer and composer whose talents are as much in demand in the studioas they are on stage. Cedras has recorded with: Paul Simon, Masekela, Makeba, Belafonte, Threadgill, Ziggy Marley, Joan Baez, Milton Nascimento, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Cassandra Wilson, Samite, Jonathan Butler .     urlLink i-Shebeen Madiba…

      I forgot to mention last night that I took a well hit ground ball to the gut which left a nice size welt on my gut. Because of that, ab work has been pushed to Friday.  Walk 5 min @ 2.2 mph pace Stretch Squats with no weight 10 reps Deadlift with 12lb dumbbell 10 reps Toe rases with unknow weight 10 reps Squats with 10lb weight 10 reps Deadlift with 12lb dumbbell 10 reps Toe rases with unknow weight 10 reps Walk 15 min @ 2.9 mph pace  Stretch  I was to have walked for 20 min but my ankle was cramping on me. I also kinda had the start of a panic attack in that I felt this chill sensation travel from the back of my neck to my arms. I could feel myself becoming uneasy yet I tried to stay focued on something else. I jumped into a conversation about the Gahanna Lion sightings and pointed out that its starting to look like a hoaks plus chimed in with the theary that death of the businessman in Iraq might be related to the government since the guy was arrested by Iraq Police and was turned over to the US officals in Bagdad before he was kidnaped. In a few minutes the feeling went away and I was able to get to the 15 minute mark before haning it up due to my ankle.

      Tonight's game was bitter sweet.   Sweet in the sense that I hit the ball really well. Part of this was due to my former high school coach pitching for the other team (I hadn't seen Tom in almost 13 years) and kept giving me nice pitches on the inside for me to drive. The other part is that I did some of the stretches that Amy taught me and that really helped me feel good turning on the ball.  The bitter part was that we lost. We had chances but you can't go 4 innings without scoring and hope to win against a good team. Also one of our better players was having a rough day and just wasn't himself.  Afterwards the team hit the sponsor's joint  urlLink BW  for brew (Sprite in my case) and wings and talked about how we need to score more runs. I was happy in that I hit well and that the team did have a good game for the most part. I'm learning to enjoy the trip as much as the destination.  I did have a bit of a spook before the game in that when I was changing John, I noticed little pinhead size dots on his chest and back. Given that he's on ampicillin and I'm allergic to anything with cillin in its name, I was worried that he was having a reaction. Come to find out it was a normal side effect and that we shouldn't worry unless he broke out with hive like rashes. I thank God it was nothing more than a side effect.

      I've always been a fan of Peter's ideas. I've always wanted to do a research paper where I would survey a subject's faith and value systems and then would have them play Lionhead's  urlLink Black and White  to see what kind of a God they would be then compare the results.   Fable is another game that challenges the player's value systems in that as you play the game, your actions do have consequence later in the game.  But with "The Movies" Peter has managed to blend into one game three different elements. A character based sim game, a business based sim game and an interactive movie maker. Now blended games tend to be weak since just trying to pull off one of the elements above is tough. However, this is Lionhead and if any develper understands their gamer, its them. So this game will be great just because they won't ship unless it is.  Check out the trailer @  urlLink IGN      urlLink PC: Lionhead's Peter Molyneux on The Movies

      I have just finished my first Adult Happy Meal also known as the Go Active Adult Happy meal. Inside one finds the premium salad of their choice (I picked fiesta), a 16.9 oz bottle of Dasani water and the 'prize' in the form of a 'Stepometer' and the 'Step with It!' walking program created by Oprah's trainer Bob Greene.   Now while I'm not a big fan of McDonald's I did want to support them as they encourage folks to eat better and I really, really wanted the Stepometer which was oddly enough copyrighted by Coca-Cola.   They also have a nice website up to help people start walking and keep walking @  urlLink http://www.goactive.com/  plus Bob Greene's site  urlLink http://www.getwiththeprogram.org/ .

      Pre-workout Notes: Amy sent me an email with my workout plan for the day since she got called to a meeting and won't be able to keep the appointment. Today's joy will be  Workout: hit some racquetball shots 5 min stationary bike Stretch Bicep curls	3x12 Push ups	3x12 Tricep pushdown 3x12 Crunch		3x12 Leg raise	3x12 15 minutes stationary bike  Post-workout Notes: Arms feel weak yet again after today's workout. But my recovery time appears to be doing better since I'm not as shaky afterwards.  Anthony Moore and Jordan Rusher stopped by my cube which was a nice surprise. Anthony just landed a 10 week internship at NASA Langley working on a database after getting his degree. Jordan is finishing up an internship with one group here and will be working for the Dewey group starting in July. Hope things go well for both of them.

      Pre Workout note: I'm tried. John didn't sleep well and having him in a high chair for most of the night at  urlLink BW  while we waited for our food on wing night didn't help. The up side is that the game was rained out last night so I'm not very sore.  Workout log: 5 minutes lifecycle level 2 Stretch Squats 15 reps (5 no weight 5 with weight 5 without weight) Shoulder pull 8 reps Crunches 12 reps Squats 15 reps (5 no weight 5 with weight 5 without weight) Shoulder pull 8 reps Leg crunches 12 reps Stretch and rest Bends and toes raises 10 reps Shoulder pull down 10 reps  Back stretch Bends and toes raises 10 reps Shoulder pull down 10 reps  Bends and toes raises 10 reps Shoulder pull down 10 reps  20 minutes lifecycle  Post workout notes: During the workout I had almost a bout of hyperness after my stretch break. Amy asked me to slow down during a set of the shoulder pull which was a first. I'm big on slow and controlled movement on the machines as a hedge against cheating. Even as I type now I've got that feeling again. Its like I want to run to get the built up energy out. I'm still tried in a way but feeling is strange for me and make me wonder if something is wrong. Like this is a high before a crash. I'm going to eat my lunch of chili and Jell-O with pineapple (I love that stuff) and relax.  BTW my shoulders are tight and my legs are like lead. Also I had to stop mid cycle to stretch my lower back since the bends were bugging the lower right side along the hipline.

      It was for the most part an uneventful day at casa de Leslie. Sure we had a rude wake up in the form of John rolling off our bed after we brought him in with us when he woke up at 5 am screaming as he does most mornings. The fall managed to scare all of us but thankfully John was unhurt.   I sent out an All Staff email for work about corporate challenge softball. Result: 3 responders. Not looking good. Also set up a  urlLink team management website .   After dinner, we ran up to Wal Mart to return some of the gifts John got for his birthday. Right now the little guy has more toys than he know what to do with. Along with that I also returned some shorts that were the wrong color. I should say here that I need to put $21 in John's account since that's how much his returned gifts were worth.  Walking into the Easton Wal Mart is always a bit unnerving for me since I always half expect to run into my Mom or my sister and brother-in-law. Part of the fear is how such a meeting would go down. Would they ignore me or say something backhanded as they walked by? Would they want to tell me off and cause a scene?   With Jean with me I have some degree of safety since she'd be more than willing to dish out anything they would try and throw at me. It's when I'm alone that I worry about getting bullied or shutting down while I get hammered with guilt.   While we didn't run into them (its been over a year since we last saw them)I still don't quite know the answer to what I would say to them if I would see them.  We did some shopping where I picked up egg beaters southwestern for my breakfast, tape for my weighted bat, a minor so we can see John and a replacement for the cell phone clip I broke. Towards the end munchies got to me and I grabbed a jar of Southwester spicy hot snack mix and some smoked almonds plus Oreo ice cream. This was stress getting to me.   Got home and put John to bed.. Here is where the title comes from. I started working on my  urlLink Freud  site for school. I started about 11 and got done around 1 but I felt like I hadn't really done anything.

Post Workout notes: My arms are like jelly. Amy jokingly said as I was leaving "Hope you don't have to type much today." At least I thought she was joking. The last part of the workout I could feel a big burn in my shoulders. I just hope Jean doesn't want me to do any lifting tonight.. I'm not even sure if I could pick up John at this point.   I also need to start dropping the carbs from the diet. It's going to be hard but worthwhile in the end.

      By the time I got to church this morning the practice for worship ws already over. I did go over the transition for the childerns message from PP to a DVD which will help make it look smoother. The DVD is for a song called Superhero. It's the kinda thing that makes me cringe. Very bad CGI charatacters and lryics that come off as smug. Yet a few parts had as a backdrop the artwork of  urlLink Alex Ross  as a background. Given Alex's background with his Dad being a preacher, I wonder if he gave them clearance but I'm not sure DC would and most of the images were from  urlLink Kingdom Come .  I also talked to one of the guys about Islam. He didn't seem to get the fact that we have gun toting radicals in Christianity who do evil under the banner of God who are just as nasty as those who claim to follow the teachings of the Koran. I need to get off my duff and post up my notes like I said I would.

      Pre Workout: Didn't sleep much again last night but what else is new. John was really fussy around bedtime and woke up a few times in the middle of the night. Plus Jean was really tired which = snoring. So I slept in the guest bed for part of the night.  Workout: 5 min Stationary bike 10 bicep curls 10 triceps pull downs 10 Sit-ups 10 bicep curls 10 triceps pull downs 10 Sit-ups 8 bicep curls 8 triceps pull downs 1 'huge set' of 5 crunches 5 leg lifts 5 crunches 5 leg lifts 10 min stationary bike 10 min treadmill  Post Workout Notes: Kind of a light day which was good given I was tired. Amy told her vacation fill-in that you can tell when I'm tired and that I wasn't afraid to let her know.   I opted to do 10 of treadmill just to mix things up. It was good since at the point my feet started to bug it was time for me to stop. I also talked Kathleen Q's ear off while she tried to do her interval training next to me. It made the time go faster.  Need to take a big walk on Monday to get my work in. Sounds like I'll be pushing the boy around the 'hood.

Back of the knee and the hamstring were ablaze while I tried to keep my heals on the ball as I pulled it in. Amy tells me in time I can move my hands in to work the abs but for now their out reaching as far as I can in an attempt to keep the ball centered.  My hamstring cramped up into the bike so I opted to stop. I'll take John for a walk to make up for the lost time if it doesn't rain.

Turn the heat back up, add back the chicken, sherry, sugar, stock, soy sauce, cornflour mixture. Bring to the boil. Watery consistency should thicken with the cornflour mixture.    6. After a few minutes once reduced and sauce of medium thickness remove from heat and serve with steamed rice.   I got this recipe from "More Long-Life Chinese Cooking" by Madame Wong and Silvia Schulman, "Jade Chicken" - that recipe had grapes. You might think I'm commiting some sort of crime by not listing grapes here, well, I'm only listing things I've tried and I didn't have grapes so I didn't make this with grapes. You're free to add them!

      Its never good when a pop millitary guy like Tom Clancy is now questioning the war.   urlLink CNN.com - Tom Clancy wrestles with Iraq war - May 25, 2004 : "A brand name author with many admirers in the military criticized the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, citing it as proof that 'good men make mistakes.' That same writer said he almost 'came to blows' with a leading war supporter, former Pentagon adviser Richard Perle. The author is Tom Clancy."

      Pre Workout: Strange day in the sense that I took the morning off to watch John while Jean was at a conference plus I had a Doctor's appointment to get some blood drawn to check up the cholesterol levels. So the workout was after work and without Amy's coaching. On top of this, I locked Jean out of the house so she had to come up to work to switch cars in order to take John home. Needless to say she wasn't happy.   Workout: Stationary bike for 5 minutes Stretch Bench press	3x12 Chest press and fly machine	3x12 Pushups	3x12 DB shoulder press	3x12 Side raise	3x12 Crunches 3x15  Leg raise 3x15.   Stationary bike for 10 minutes  Post Workout: My arms died midway into my first set of Side raise. Just would not move. Plus I could feel myself cheating so I opted out. I was also pressed to get home to help Jean with John so I did just 10 minutes on the bike but at level 3 rather than 2.  I learned today that until I'm feeling more comfortable, I need to work with Amy since it is much easier to work out with a trainer keeping you honest.

      Pre Workout: Something about Thursday's and John not wanting to sleep all night. I didn't really get to bed until almost 2 am.   Workout: 5 min Stationary bike 10 bicep curls 10 triceps pull downs 10 Sit-ups 10 bicep curls 10 triceps pull downs 10 Sit-ups 10 bicep curls 10 triceps pull downs 1 'huge set' of 5 crunches 5 leg lifts 5 crunches 5 leg lifts 5 crunches 5 leg lifts 20 min treadmill  Post Workout Notes: Arms are bugging me a bit. Especially my left shoulder but that's my weak side anyway. I got a little lightheaded after getting off the treadmill but that could be me just being tired from the lack of sleep.   Also I switch my workout shoes from my  urlLink Nike  walkers to a pair of  urlLink Reebok  hightops. The hightops helped with supporting my ankles as I walked on the treadmill but the DMX Light cushioning in the sole of the shoe gave me this strange feedback. Almost like walking on a pillow that wasn't helping the lightheadedness if I was really having any.

      Pre Workout notes: Amy's on vacation so I'm working with the trainer who is out of Verizon. I couldn't remember her name but she was a big help in that she would give me a countdown as I closed in on the end of the set.  Had another strange dream about my Mom which left me not exactly ready to face the day. Plus I was sore from not stretching after softball last night.  Workout 5 min stationary bike Stretch Bench squat 20 no weight 15 crunches  urlLink Bent over delta rises  12 Bench Squat 15 no weight 15 crunches  urlLink Bent over delta rises  12  urlLink Supine leg curls  12 Knee lifts 10 Supine leg curls 10 Knee lifts 8 Pull down 12 Seated Row 12  10:00 min stationary bike	   Post Workout notes: The Supine leg curls just flat out kill....again. I did better with keeping the ball under control but man it is not fun.  I caught a burst of energy midwork out but half way into the bike my heart was pumping so hard I thought I was going to drop. So I backed off and took a long shower in the handicap shower that has a seat in it till I was able to bring my heart rate down to a dull roar. I'm feeling better over all but the weight is still not moving which is a downer.

      We tried every way you could lose tonight.  1. Not enough players 2. Bad glove work in the field 3. Poor hitting 4. Ticking the other team off  Yet we won. I played the first inning at first but moved to 3rd since our sub, a fellow named Vincent, was a really good pitcher. I made a good pick / throw for an out but got handcuffed on a ball with bases loaded. I got the force out at third but we could have been out of the inning had I picked it clean.  At the plate I was 2 for 5 with 2 doubles. First one was after I ran on Doc's arm in right who had sub'ed for us last week. Doc is a shorter, older guy who can still play but who shouldn't had been in the outfield since he's better at 2nd.  The other was in the 7th. Down by two runs we had runners on 2nd and 3rd when they put Vincent on since he could flat out mash the ball backside (right field for him). He had a new  urlLink DeMarini Vexxum half and half 26 oz . that I had been eyeing so I asked him if I could swing it. Vincent said sure and I drove the 2nd pitch two hops to the fence to tie the game. Another free pass to Rick to load them back up when Dan drove Vincent in for the win.  My other AB were two weak grounders to 2nd and a line drive to 2nd. I need to get in the cage.  Also we had some nasty feelings since one of our guys kept driving the ball up the middle on the pitcher after a first inning walk. Words were said after the two were in a play at the plate but mostly it amounted to nothing.   I also dropped off to Chip Miller  urlLink Don Cherry's Lucky 13  DVD since he said last week what a big  urlLink Slap Shot  fan he is. I played with Chip at  urlLink Columbus State  and against him for years in the Northpark Church of Christ league. Northpark are now in the Westerville league on the same night as my league. I'm not sure Don's views on Slap Shot but I know the man love old time hard hitting hockey.

      - Headed up to Marble Head to visit my Aunt and Uncle, my cousins and their new  urlLink boat  which they have docked at  urlLink Bay Point  just across from  urlLink Cedar Point . We didn't get to take the boat out since my Aunt's eye is still bugging her but my Uncle, Ally and I went out for most of the day on the  urlLink See doo's  which were addicting once I got comfortable with skipping along the water at over 40 knots. My arms were dead from the vibation plus the action of pushing and pulling the controls as the water got choppy. While it was chilly, I didn't get cold until I got splashed by a wave on the way back to the Harbor from one of the private islands near by. That island (name I can't recall) had some of the most interesting homes I've seen in a long time.  John wore a life vest the whole time which was cute since it broke his fall when he would stumble.   - Sunday we just sat around  - Monday we hit the  urlLink Utica Ice Cream Festive  at the Velvet Ice Cream Factory and Mill. What started to look like a crapy rainy day was quite nice as we had lunch at the Mill and let John feed the goats.

      Forget Reagan.. Ray Charles was a national hero.  Elvis Costello had better send flowers.. He's still a shmuck in my book after the events reprinted from  urlLink http://www.elviscostello.info/faq/general.html    Q. What was the Bonnie Bramlett/Ray Charles incident? A. Elvis back in early 1979 made some not-so-politically-correct comments about Ray Charles (calling him a 'blind, ignorant n***er') while drinking with Bonnie Bramlett and Stephen Stills in the bar of the Holiday Inn -Downtown in Columbus, Ohio. He also called Stills 'steel nose', in reference to Stills' one-time cocaine habit.  A fight then ensued between the Attractions and Stills' backing band. He was later forced to make a  public apology at a press conference.  >From an interview with Greil Marcus in Rolling Stone, September 2, 1982:   'What actually happened was this: we were in the bar--Bruce Thomas and I were in the bar after the show in Columbus, Ohio.  And we very very drunk. Well, we weren't drunk to begin with--we were reasonably drunk.  And we started into what you'd probably call joshing.  Gentle gibes between the two camps of the Stills Band and us.  It developed as it got drunker and drunker into a nastier and nastier argument.  And I suppose that in the drunkenness, my contempt for them was probably exaggerated beyond my real contempt for them.  I don't think I had a real opinion.  But they just seemed in some way to typify a lot of things that I thought were wrong with American music.  And that's probably quite unfair.  But at the exact moment--they did.'  '...What it was about was that I said the most outrageous thing I could possibly say to them--that I knew, in my drunken logic, would anger them more than anything else.'

      Ok, here's a few things I've been reading, watching or jamming to of note:  Books:   urlLink Footprints of God   by Greg Iles The story was kinda lame but it did have some interesting ideas about the ethics behind uploading someone's conscience into a computer.    urlLink Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom   by Cory Doctorow Just started reading this on my Palm m105 as an experiment into just how enjoyable an ebook would be for me. Keep in mind the company I work for owns the largest ebook collection in the world. So far it's been just OK (screen size sucks) but the book has given me that culture shock as a reader that comes from only the best science fiction. Last time this happened was with  urlLink  Futureland   by Walter Mosley.  Comics:  urlLink  Bite Club   has been a fun read with its vampires meets the  urlLink Sopranos  in  urlLink Miami Vice  (or  urlLink Vice City  for those who aren't kids from the 80's) I loved the first cover they did.    urlLink Kiss Kiss Bang Bang  : I'm a sucker for anything  urlLink Bond  or spy related and this has been par for the course. However I noticed that it wasn't listed past issue 6 so it doesn't look like CrossGen is going to keep the title going.  Tunes stuck in my head: Switchfoot's  urlLink Meant to Live    Nina Simone's Feeling Good as heard in the new  urlLink Six Feet Under  preview  Hoobastank's  urlLink The Reason   A Perfect Circle's  urlLink The Outsider   TV:  urlLink The Saint  is on  urlLink BBC America  everyday!

Quick, can you name the 4 left out with a bonus to name the one he added?   "For some reason, the most vocal Christians among us never mention the beatitudes. But, often with tears in their eyes, they demand that the Ten Commandments be posted in public buildings. And of course that's Moses, not Jesus. I haven't heard one of them demand that the Sermon on the Mount, the beatitudes, be posted anywhere."   - Kurt Vonnegut   Taken From  urlLink http://www.inthesetimes.com/site/main/article/cold_turkey/

      People lose their freaking minds when a foul ball heads their way. The worse I saw was when a ball was fouled back and some shumck tried to catch the ball, which was going about 90, only to bail at the last moment allowing it to clock the kid behind him who was sitting down and never saw it because bro blocked his vision.  Another classic was when a kid had gotten up with his Mom to go under the stands. Their seats were in the 3rd row from the diamond and should have waited for a stop in play rather than get up in the middle of an at bat. A line drive foul ball drilled him just under the ribs with such a force that one of the players said he thought the kid  At least the kid in this story got some love. As for the dude who clocked him, said to be a former youth pastor, hope it was worth it.  urlLink ESPN.com - MLB - Fair shake for 4-year-old: Trove of souvenirs

      I loved Augie's comments on bunting during last night's USC / Cal State Fullerton game.  When asked why he brought back the bunt, Augie noted that hitting a baseball is hard and that if you wait to congratulate a kid for getting a hit, you might wait a long time. Yet if the kid bunts, even if he makes an out you can boost him up by congratulating him on getting the bunt down and helping the team. In the long run, Augie feels this helps the kid to be a better player. I couldn't agree more.  urlLink www.TexasSports.com : "Augie Garrido"

      I want the Gamecock's fornula for "Durple" Gamecocks find recipe for success By Wayne Drehs ESPN.com  OMAHA, Neb. -- Go ahead, tell the South Carolina Gamecocks that you don't believe in baseball superstitions.  Tell them that age-old baseball rituals like drawing pictures in the dirt in front of their dugout, shaking their caps upside down like homeless beggars, or refusing to step on the foul lines, is all nonsense. And then watch them turn around, walk away and laugh.  	Chad Blackwell Chad Blackwell and South Carolina are one win from the title series. Nobody wonders how Ray Tanner's team has rolled off three wins in a row with their backs firmly pressed against the Rosenblatt Stadium wall -- they've put up some offensive fireworks that would impress even George Steinbrenner.  But beneath the 47 hits, 35 runs and three straight victories -- all in the face of elimination -- sits two rarely talked about motivational themes. They couldn't be more baseball-ish. And they couldn't be more different.  One side is serious. The other side is not. One side touches the heart. The other side makes people shake their heads.  In one corner, there's the story of 6-year-old Charlie Peters, an Omaha boy the team met at the Omaha Children's Hospital during last year's trip to the College World Series.  Charlie was in "rough shape" when the team met him a year ago, but he clicked with the Gamecocks, played catch with a couple of them and became a die-hard fan. When the team returned home, Charlie sent them a giant poster covered with his handprints and pictures of him in South Carolina garb. They put the poster on the door of the clubhouse, the last thing they see on the way to the field.  But prior to this year's visit to Omaha, team members hadn't heard from him. There was concern. But then Charlie showed up at the South Carolina hotel Monday morning prior to the team's game against LSU.  His cancer is in remission. He's playing Little League. And he gave the team a giant banner that read, "I won my battle, now you win yours." He also passed along a mini beanie baby that he said brought him good luck during his darkest days in the hospital, which he thought could bring them luck for the rest of the series.  Carolina catcher Landon Powell hasn't let the bear out of his sight since. It sits on the Gamecock bat rack, with every player touching it for good luck before heading to the plate.  Since Charlie's hotel visit, the Gamecocks have 47 hits and 35 runs and are 3-0. And with a win Thursday against Cal State Fullerton, they could advance to the national championship series this weekend.  "There's no question it's had an effect on how we play," South Carolina closer Chad Blackwell said. "We want to win not only for ourselves, but for him. It's such a great story. He's such a motivator. He won his battle, now we have to fight for him and win ours."  Powell even brought the bear to the postgame news conference Wednesday.  "It's worked so far," Powell said, shrugging his shoulders. "I don't know what else to say."  As for the Gamecocks' other area of baseball superstition, well, be prepared for the outlandish.  It's called Cockade. And before you start giggling, before you start worrying about another run of male enhancement commercials during next year's Super Bowl, understand it's a drink. A performance drink.  In big games, instead of drinking straight Gatorade, which was created in 1965 by four Florida scientists, the South Carolina baseball team drinks its own special concoction, created by team trainer Brainard Cooper.  	“ 	Baseball is a game of superstitions. Any time you find something that works, you go with it. We're going to go with this as far as we can. ” 		— South Carolina closer Chad Blackwell  The whole idea of a special concoction started two years ago, when the Gamecocks were facing Florida in a critical SEC game. They decided they didn't want to drink straight Gatorade, which the school has made more than $90 million from since 1970, in that game. So Cooper mixed several flavors of Gatorade with some other secret ingredients and covered the label with the word "Cockade."  "I don't remember what happened that day, but it must have been something good," Cooper said. "Because we kept doing it."  In the years since, Cooper and the Gamecock players have developed about six different flavors, ranging from "Durple" (Dark Purple), "Ectoplasm" (a neon green colored drink), and "Not Water" to "Cockade."  There's another mixture the Gamecocks pull out in dire straits. After last week's 2-0 loss to Cal State Fullerton in the CWS opener, the players went to Cooper and specifically requested it.  "I didn't even bring the ingredients," Cooper said. "So I had to run out to the store and buy them."  He's had to do it before every game since.  "When our backs are against the wall, that's the stuff you want," Powell said of the unsettling brown-colored drink. "It's delicious. And if you think about the name, the color fits."  Cooper refused to reveal his magic potions, only saying that it involves several different Gatorade flavors. But whatever is in the drink, it's worked. So too has the lucky little bear passed along by Charlie Peters. Now if they can just get it to work one more night, the Gamecocks will be playing for the national championship this weekend.  "Baseball is a game of superstitions," Blackwell said. "Any time you find something that works, you go with it. We're going to go with this as far as we can."

      Yesterday I pulled out most (90%) of all the magazines I own and with Jean's help, sorted them by title, bundled and counted them to be sold. Without counting the top two titles held (Entertainment Weekly and Sports Illustrated) I had over 400 magazines. SI is well over 100 and EW would be close. So in fact it's closer to 600.  Magazines were the one thing I kept more than anything else. It was almost compulsive in the fact I would keep them in piles in both my room and in the basement when I lived with my parents. Never really sorted but in piles that only I knew.  Once while I was at school my Dad 'helped' me by gutting half of my collection while I was at Columbus State for class. I remember feeling violated but there was nothing I could do. He was my Dad and I was living under his roof. I took comfort in the fact he didn't get them all pitched had I stopped off on the way home.  Now I look at the piles with guilt. For being such a pack rat. For placing such importance in something so temporary as to haul them around, some as long as 20 years. For spending so much money on them at a time when I had little to spend and when now I'll get little if any for them.  I'm going to post the list online sometime this week

      You've got to be kidding me...  President Bush, seeking to mobilize religious conservatives for his reelection campaign, has asked church-going volunteers to turn over church membership directories, campaign officials said on Thursday.  In a move sharply criticized both by religious leaders and civil libertarians, the Bush-Cheney campaign has issued a guide listing about two-dozen "duties" and a series of deadlines for organizing support among conservative church congregations.  A copy of the guide obtained by Reuters directs religious volunteers to send church directories to state campaign committees, identify new churches that can be organized by the Bush campaign and talk to clergy about holding voter registration drives.  The document, distributed to campaign coordinators across the country earlier this year, also recommends that volunteers distribute voter guides in church and use Sunday service programs for get-out-the-vote drives.   urlLink My Way - News

      In an effort to cut back on our budget as much as possible, I switched our cable service from  urlLink TimeWarner  to  urlLink WideOpenWest  this weekend. The upside is that WOW's digital cable is cheaper and offers all of the  urlLink Starz channels  in addition to extra  urlLink Nick channels  and  urlLink Telemundo . The downside is that the channels are all over the freaking place. Forget the fact that we had our favs pretty much memorized from the TW lineup but you need the interactive guide to even have a hope of finding anything since the lineup doesn't come in logical blocks. For example,  Starz! is next to ESPN News on WOW. Also I had to drop RoadRunner which runs at a blazing 1.5 mbps vs.. The 500bps that I've got with WOW. I could jump to the 2 Mbps plan but that would nuke the cost savings. I'm going to give it a month and if it doesn't improve, I'll call TW back out.  BTW: For just $60, WOW ran the line to my attic with two outlets coming out of the cealing for my soon to be wall mounted TVs.

           Corporate Challenge Softball tournament got washed out by today's rains killing Pete Insabella's hopes of ever being a weather forcaster. The upside is that we get a few more workouts in a as team. Downside.. Well there is making sure who we have committed can make the rain date, then there is the gorilla in the room, what to do about those players who bailed but who are now available? Do you offer them a slot and bench someone who was coming out? Do you roll with who you have an not take the opourtuity to impove the team? I tend to lean with roll what I have. I'm also kinda bummed about not getting this in since this means more work for me arranging practices while trying to get my own workouts in and playing fall ball.          Went to a birthday party for Sammy Longo, who is 4 years old. I was talking with her Dad Angelo and asked if he played softball since Rick is getting up a fall team and we might need someone. He said yes and added that he has a  urlLink DeMarini . If anything indicated that he's played some ball, it's the fact that he's carrying a DeMarini in the bag. I was always on the fence with how much difference the DeMarini had vs other high end bats from  urlLink Easton  and  urlLink Louisville Slugger . Sure I've seen balls carry farther when they were hit with one but everytime I tried to swing one I just couldn't tell the difference between what I've been using (a Nike Bataboom) and the D until I hit a 26oz 34 in. Vexxum this year. The Ball just jumped off that stick with for me was a slow swing. Lord knows I've could have gone yard had I got into it. Made me very temped to try and snag one when they change models in the spring. Still it's hard for me to drop over $200 bones for a bat.     Got an invite to my niece's birthday party. Given that I haven't seen her, ever, I was kinda surpised. I mean I haven't talked to my Mom, Sister or Brother-in-Law since my BiL go into me over the whole money issue after my Dad's passing. Needless to say, we'll send a gift but not attend. Still too much junk inside of me on this and I'm not at a point to be the one to reach out. I did have a dream that we managed to patch things up but even if we did, they would have to make the first move.

      As the subject line reads, it's been awhile since my last post. Things have been busy between getting the house ready for 4th of July, John's visit to Cleveland, getting the house ready for the playdate,  urlLink school  and last but not least, this frigging cold that's been traveling around my body like a tired tourist camping out on the  urlLink Disney World train  ride.    So I'm tired and while sick, I'm not sick enough to stay home. In short, I'm really grumpy and I can't sleep.    So with this in mind, here is a list of thing currently ticking me off in my grumpy-ness    1. Corporate Challenge softball: I've lost 3 players (2 female and 1 male) in 24 hours. Given this rate of attrition, I might be like my man Charlie Brown, alone on the mound getting my clothes knocked off by come backers.     Given that we have  urlLink IBM  in the first round and we'll have to roll with just nine in the field plus take an automatic out when the 10th batter comes up, I'll talk some  urlLink OS/2 Warp  /  urlLink Linux  smack as a way to save face.      2. Comp 107: Things had better pick up once we get to  urlLink Photoshop  or I'm going to be really, really pissed.     3. Work: I could say something but then I wouldn't stop   4. This cold. I've got a low grade hack that brings up just enough flem to be called flem. Throw in a touch of something that has me feel like I'm walking on ball and you get a nice idea of my state. Oh, wait, I have no energy from the lack of really good sleep.

       The Weebel has done it..   She has pissed me off for the last time.   Allow me to back track. The Weebel is the woman who runs the cash register at the cafe in my building. Rather, she sits on her milk crate throne and bitches about everything. Too big of a bill to pay for your lunch? Weebel bitches. Pay with too much in coin, Weebel bitches. Make the Weebel get off the milk crate throne..Bitch.   When the Weebel needs something from one of the staff in the back, she yells. If they fail to answer then she'll hobble the whopping 5 step from the throne to the grill, bitching with each step. See the Weebel has every known aliment known to man yet all it does is give her even more fodder to bitch about. I'm now convinced that Death is afrade of the Weebel.   So what did she do earn my scorn?    Lunch time today   I go for the chicken tortilla soup 95 cents a bowl. I have $1   The "to go" bowls are gone so I use an "eat in" bowl.   Weebel gives me the total of $1.02 having charged me the "eat in" tax on the item. Rather than agruge with the Weebel I agree to pay but ..  I say "Sorry but I just have a dollar."   Weebel stares    Now I was expecting "Don't worry about it" or "Get me next time" especial after I paid the Weebel last week for a Sprite fountain drink that she thought was water. I mean, I told her after she gave me the total and I even had to show her the bubbles to prove it wasn't water!    I say "I've got change at my desk. I can bring it down later."   Weeble huffs with an exhale "Just get it here by 3"   Me "Thanks"   Weeble "mumble mumble Jesus Christ mumble mumble"      Over 2 Lincoln, 2 copper brothers, 2 pennies. You've got to be kidding me.      Oh the Weebel is going to get her 2 freaking cents. And that it.. I'm never giving the Weebel a cent... ever. Not like I'm a big spender in the cafe but I'll walk across campus to the other cafe before I put any money in the Weebel's palm.

Both were discretionary wars entered into under false assumptions, and you could argue that both initially had worthy goals. The Iraq adventure, however, was crippled by a fatal arrogance from the onset.

      Now that it was explaned this way, I've got new respect for the guy which is up from boy in my book and not close to Man.  From ESPN's vengeance scale    8.0 -- Justin Timberlake's "Cry Me A River" video.  (Note: The most underrated example of vengeance on this list. After Britney cheated on him, not only did he dump her, he put out a best-selling album fueled by a song about their breakup in which he basically destroys her with the lyrics. Just an unbelievable piece of work. It's devastating. I can't even imagine what she did when she first heard it. And if that wasn't enough, he made a well-received video about the song, starring a Britney look-alike. And if THAT wasn't enough, he immediately started going out with Cameron Diaz. By the time he was done, Britney's career was in the tank -- she was chain-smoking and hanging out with backup dancers and white trash guys from her hometown. Now that, my friends, is vengeance. Bravo, Justin. Bravo.)   urlLink ESPN.com: Page 2 - Welcome to the Vengeance Scale

       Last night marked the official end of the softball season for the Buffalo Wild Wings team.    In our 4th meeting of the season with the Master Batters, we got pounded. Everything they hit found a gap. Everything we hit found a glove. By the time the ball cleared the fence for their grand slam that was apart of an 11 run inning, we as a team, were done.    &nbsp;  Me, about the only highlight of the day was a triple I hit to lead off the 4th. My first at bat I got on top of a ball that I should have drove into next month which became a line drive out to the first baseman. The triple was in part thanks to the left fielder moving way in and giving me the line. The 2nd pitch I was able to drop step and drive it over his head. It also helped that I think the guy in left is an asshole so I wanted to burn him.&nbsp; For the record I would like to note that&nbsp;I used Bill Miller's 26oz    Milken Freak.   &nbsp;That stick had a nice feel to it.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  It was a disappointing year for the most part but I did have fun playing. The team never quite jellied and we struggled to get the same guys out week after week. We also had a skill level issue vs the rest of the league. While we could compete if we had folks there, we just had too much inconstancy on who would be there from week to week. In a men's rec league, this would not be a big deal. But in a men's open league in a place like Westerville, it's a great way to get beat and beat bad.   Still I want to tee it up for fall ball. To do that, I'm going to need the following items for which I'll be hunting the closeout bins for at the local sports megamarts:     Cleats. I have blown out my  urlLink Adadis  on both sides. Not bad after almost 5 years of heavy use. I'm thinking Nike MCS Slams would be a nice replacement.   Bat bag. Zipper is almost blown and there's a hole from what looks like a mouse. Given that it's over 12 years old, it's due.

      Most people hate them with a passion but the political ad sadly is how most people get their information on canidates. If anything, check out the  urlLink Bush 1988 ads  where Lee (the slinger) Atwater turned the Attack Ad into an art form.  urlLink The Living Room Candidate  urlLink

       Illinois Senate Candidate   urlLink  Barack Obama    Must be heard to gain it's full impact.    urlLink NPR audio   urlLink DNC Video      If there's a child on the south side of Chicago who can't read, that  matters to me, even if it's not my child. If there's a senior citizen somewhere  who can't pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the  rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it's not my grandmother. If there's an  Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due  process, that threatens my civil liberties. It's that fundamental belief-I am my  brother's keeper, I am my sisters' keeper-that makes this country work. It's  what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a  single American family. "E pluribus unum." Out of many, one.      Yet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the  spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes.  Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative  America-there's the United States of America.    There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian  America; there's the United States of America. The pundits like to  slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for  Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We  worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents  poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the  Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States.     There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it.  We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all  of us defending the United States of America.

       Friday:   Almost a total waste of a day. I had opted not to go out with Jean, Patty and Jay so that I could work on some screen grabs for my group's preventing presentation. The plan was I would watch John, put him down for bed then get to work. Jean could have a nice dinner with her sister and brother-in-law while I pounded out my homework.   Things went south about an hour into Mama walking out the door. First, my copy of PhotoShop Elements had expired. Granted I have the full 7.01 version of 'da shop' but I need the grabs since the class is working with PS Elements. I did have a copy still valid on my work machine but that meant trugging&nbsp;40 min round trip&nbsp;to do something that would take 10.  Next, John woke up. While I was able to get him back down, he wasn't in that good deep sleep. This meant when Jean got home. Boy was up.. and When he's up..he's up. Kid didn't go back down til 1 am.    Saturday:   A great day to play golf.. Except I'm going to work to do homework. Get the homework done and sent to my team, stop at the library to pick up my copy of the  urlLink Complete Peanuts 1950-1952  (stunning collection and a must buy) and then to Meijers to grab supplies for the Mom's Club picnic (three boxes of shells and cheese, 1 gallon of milk and a plastic tray)   The park for the picnic was another of Gahanna's hidden gems. It had a nice play area, a lake, shelter house, softball and baseball diamonds. It also had a set of railroad tie steps going up a hill that John fell face first into while I was watching him. Man did I feel guilty. The damage to the little man was a cut chin, scraped lip and some bleeding from the mouth. We had a good time eating with the  urlLink Maxwell's  and talking about different things like the Tiki party they went to and different forms of fighting arts. I just hope I didn't talk their ears off.    Sunday:   Went to the &nbsp; urlLink zoo &nbsp;after Jean had gone to church (John and I slept in after he was up again). A nice lunch and it was off to the  urlLink petting zoo  where John got to take his first pony ride. We also hit the  urlLink merry-go-round  before heading home since I had a showing to attend in Delaware for a co-worker who had lost his wife in a car accident while on a family vacation in California.&nbsp; I had never been to something like this before...where the lost was instant. So I struggled to find words and just didn't try when it was my turn to meet with the family.   On the way to Delaware is my Dad's grave&nbsp;at  urlLink Kingwood . I haven't been there since he was laid to rest there in Dec 2002. I stopped on the way home. No real reason other than to see if the stone was there. I didn't even get out of the car. I did stop and have one  urlLink White Castle  for Dad on the way home.

          It just hit me in class tonight that I've been working in the online sector of Information Technology for 10 years.  I got my start working 4pm to 1am for CompuServe in the membership sales department. We would take inbound calls from people interested in joining CompuServe and we would fill their request for information while trying to get them to join the service. We would also pitch them CompuServe's  urlLink WinCIM  software, books on the service and gift certificates. Here I learned that Z was Zead, what a postal code was and that I had found that my hobby was now my profession thanks to those few months on the phones at Ticketmaster.  When membership sales was outsourced (I got a trip to Denver to train the call center replacing us on how the CompuServe's Internet services worked out of the deal) I was moved to tech support and started an internship with the new Internet Marketing group. This was a time of almost pure Hell. I was suffering from  urlLink panic attacks , working under the last Intern who was on my case for not being as techinal as he was then having to take tech calls that I was barley trained to handle. I also played a small roll in the infamous  urlLink Christmas Eve raid on the CompuServe Munich office . See we were using Open Relay with our Usenet servers and in that relay was every form of porn known to man. German government raid the office, arrested the Felix Somm on site and we in Columbus pulled all of the alt.sex feeds off the relay. Knowing how popular these were, I gave customer service a list of what Usenet Newsgroups were pulled so that they would know not to bug the Supervisors and me asking what was up. Thing was, the morons sent the list to members, which then make it onto the net. The only saving grace was that I still loved to geek with the newest stuff on the service like the  urlLink CompuServe CD Magazine.  This would help me build up enough momentum to punch out and join the QA team. I also found out that part of my panic attacks were due to a  urlLink heart rhythm disorder  which had the exact same symptoms.  Over the next few years I would work with some really great and smart folks who always outnumbered the handful of major jerks. I learned a lot, bugged the crap out of people with my simpleton 'ideas' (I'm still think those  urlLink shopping bots  are going to hit someday) that never made it out of email, testing first products, then channels and finally web pages while surviving the               urlLink Spry Internet In a Box     Rise and Fall of  urlLink WOW!        Getting sent to do software      code level testing without any training        urlLink CompuServe's 'deal' with      Microsoft        urlLink CompuServe's 'deal' with      TimeWarner for Magazine content  (Question: What does Prodigy (more on them later),  urlLink Pathfinder       and CompuServe all have in common? They all hosted TW magazine based      content)      The Fall of  urlLink C       The trade between  urlLink AOL and      WorldCom       The  urlLink purchase of Netscape               I had stock options (something no one in my family understood) . I was 'reviewing' games with FedEx every week dropping me off games from Microsoft like  urlLink Crimson Skies  and  urlLink StarLancer  a month before they hit the shelves. Free magazines from publishers trying to get us to buy ads where on the shredders all the time. Got to help with  urlLink Mozilla.org  to find how to handle the .ART files AOL used.. OK so I gave them an email of someone who knew someone but they still owe me a Zilla doll! Life was good.  Then the TimeWarner deal hit the day my Mom had surgery and my now wife totaled her mini van in a wreck. A few weeks later I got a nice goodie box from TW with  urlLink Casablanca  on DVD and  urlLink The Matrix  on VHS (huh?) plus a Soprano's t-shirt. The day after the deal closed about a year later, I was told that the company did not have a roll for me.  Two months later I had cashed out my stock (except for  urlLink 80 shares  that, like those bots, are going to be bank someday) landed a gig at  urlLink OCLC  thanks to my boss taking a chance on me and bought a house (something my parents never did).  Now I'm learning about the joys of  urlLink ISO , had a little guy with the partner, and headed back to  urlLink school  since the whole CompuServe thing was just to get some money so I could get my History degree.  I've also grown a ton. My life, like Computing 10 years ago is so different yet still maintains connections to the past that brought it to where it is.

      I must admitt that this hit me between the eyes. My current record for keeping a DVD from NetFlix was  urlLink The Animatrix  at just under one year.  Question for you library folks? Do you see the same trend with your patrons when it comes to longer borrowing limits ?  From  urlLink http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/002236.html   In practice, it’s different - at least in my experience. Movies that we’ve rented sometimes sit there for two or three months before we watch them, or eventually, reluctantly, decide to send them back without seeing them. To my shame, this happens most often with the interesting, difficult films with sub-titles. I suspect that this is because we’re accustomed to thinking of DVDs as stocks rather than flows. Because we have physical possession of the DVD, we’re disinclined to give it back until we’ve actually watched it. Of course, this means that we face substantial costs - we may very easily end up paying more money to rent the damn movie than we would have to pay to buy it and keep it forever. Meanwhile, Netflix is laughing all the way to the bank. It’s much smarter to think of the rental service as a flow - you’re likely to be happier if you keep the movies coming along in a steady stream, even if you don’t watch them (the latter may be useful information about your actual preferences, as opposed to the preferences that you would like to have). I suspect that virtually any reasonable decision rule along the lines of ‘send the movie back if you haven’t watched it within two weeks’ is likely to produce better results than our current policy of watching the movies whenever we get around to it. Or, more typically, don’t get around to it.   urlLink Hacking NetFlix : The Crooked Timber Blog Discusses Netflix

       As you may or may not know, I work for  urlLink OCLC  where we maintain one of, if not the largest bibliographic catalog in the world,  urlLink WorldCat . Keep this in the buffer since I need to digress a bit and show you how 4 things completely unrelated to each other fuse into what I hope is an interesting question for folks in the information sciences.        N ow the other night I was sitting back and thinking about the conflicting advice my wife and I had gotten about our son's tongue.      S ee, John is  urlLink tongue tied  (yes, its not just a figure of speech) and the question was one of cut it or leave it be. We got nurses telling us to cut or he won't be able to breast feed while the Doctors are telling us if the cut isn't done right, his tongue could be paralyzed. So we opted to wait since he could in fact breast feed. 15 months later, this question is still nagging at us, especially since he's starting to make sounds and being tongue tied could lead to a speech impediment. So we took him to see  urlLink Dr. Darryl Willett , one of the best Ear Nose and Throat surgeons in Columbus and the man who stopped my snoring thanks to his "el grande" surgery that laid me low for two solid weeks. Doc said if he was still an infant, he take John in the back, snip the tongue in about 3 sec, 2 minutes to stich the cuts and off we go. But now since John is a toddler, we'd have to knock him out. So the best thing would be to wait to see if the speech is impacted and if it is, then we snip.        L ater I got to thinking about this whole mess with all its conflicting information, lack of a clear place to turn to for knowledge and how these decisions would impact my son's life. I saw this as fodder for a science fiction short story that has been kicking around in me for years about life post bio weapon attack. I wanted to do it as a blog with links to web sites which would pull the reader deeper into the world that the story takes place in. Then I remember that something like this was done much in a much cooler way that I could ever dream of.       F or the movie  urlLink A.I.  one of the visionaries in gaming,  urlLink Jordan Weisman  and the folks at Microsoft developed project code name  urlLink 'the beast'  to promote the movie. It was a collection of websites seeded across the web with registered domains, working email and voice mail addresses for people and companies based in the world of the movie. The entry point was a strange job title next to a name in the credits for the A.I. trailer. Google that name or that job title and you got the first site which had the basis for the mystery and the first clue / puzzle. The 'game' was to find out why a developer at an AI research center was murdered. Figure out the clues and puzzles that pulled you deeper into the world by opening up other sites. At one point they hired an actor to answer one of the phone numbers and give clues since the team never bet on people working together to  urlLink solve the thing .           N ow this is where OCLC and cataloging fit in. How would you catalog something like 'the beast'? Snap shot of the web page? Won't work since it could be in constant update mode. At the end of the project? Maybe or maybe not. It could go on with another writer or team. Now throw in blogs for a moment. With more and more mainstream writers turning to blogs like Dave Berry, how does the information sciences preserve this kind of writings for future generations? So feel free to kick in your ideas in the feedback.
