      Well, I found my pen. It was on the other desk, the one behind me. It's a nice Papermate pen I bought a while ago because I needed one and it was, at the time, the cheapest I could find, at Â£1.25 from the Post Office shop. It's a nice pen, and I quite like it. I tend to get emotionally attached to pens, especially those that go through exams with me. This pen is really comfortable, unlike those 15p things that cause my middle finger to blister after only half an hour of writing. Not very good in 3 hour exams.  Damn, I've just had a nosebleed, and now there's blood all over the keyboard. I'll have to clean that up with a toothbrush, just like in that advert I saw once, for an Aquafresh brush, I think. But the guy in the advert was cleaning up deodorant, not blood. And I've only got Oral-B toothbrushes, and my sister's cheap Tesco ones. I'll use my one, for hygeine reasons, of course. Ugh, the number of different substances that must have found their way onto this keyboard...  I don't know if anyone's reading this at all, but has anybody seen Troy? If so, why? I really don't understand it. It's an ancient story, and everyone knows how it ends. It's like Titanic, or the Passion of the Christ.   !!!! Trojan horse, Troy falls; Titanic sinks; Christ dies on cross, forming a somewhat popular cult. !!!!    So bored..

      This is my first post on my first blog. I'm very bored, and I've lost my pen.  OK, so a few things about me. I'm 17 years old, and I live in Chesterfield, England. I live with my three sisters (all of whom are younger than me) and my two parents, imaginatevely called 'Mum' and 'Dad' (both of whom are older than me). I have a job at McDonald's, which I am trying to quit, but my pleas fall on deaf managerial ears. Therefore, I've decided to take a 'holiday of unspecified duration', basically meaning I'm taking my holiday pay and not coming back until such a time that I'm sure I won't find another job. And I will find another job, simply because I'm great.  So, yeah, as I was saying; I live with my family. Hehe... a semicolon. You don't see many semicolons these days. I'm one of those people that likes good grammar and correct English. Bad English pisses me off. I dislike txt speak, I can just about tolerate H4xx0rz, but people who use bad English out of sheer ignorance and poor education get on my tits. And those American people; they don't know how to spell anything, and I have to endure this Americanisation, this bastardisation of such a lovely language. Yes, that's '-isation', not '-ization'. I mean, wtf is wrong with the word 'sweets'? Where does 'candy' come from? In fact, I'm going to check that etymology. It comes from the Arabic qand, meaning cane sugar. Well, I guess I can accept that, even though 'sweets' is 876% better.  Wow, for a first post this is really starting to get long. I'll end it here, and make another post tonight, if I can be arsed.
