      Saturday morning, at home, busy line when trying to access the internet, what can I do then? Asked myself. Well, turn the TV on, on MetroTV channel, there was Oprah Winfrey's Show, inviting Tobey McGuire and Kirsten Dunst from blockbuster movie “Spiderman 2”.  Oprah, her guests, and the audiences had a discussion about “real hero in our lives” (well, I thought that was the right topic for the discussion. And she invited some of the heroes.  One of the guests—the real hero—that interested me most was a little girl, named Alex.  (I pasted  urlLink this ):    urlLink Alexandra "Alex" Scott  is the 8 year old founder of Alex's Lemonade Stand For Pediatric Cancer Research. Two days before her first birthday she was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, an aggressive  urlLink childhood cancer . Since that time Alex has continually fought her cancer, with doctors and researchers still trying to achieve a cure. At the age of four, Alex decided to do something to make that cure more likely. She opened her first lemonade stand in July of 2000 with the idea of donating the proceeds to "her hospital." Each year since, Alex has held an annual lemonade standing her front yard. As word has spread, donations have poured in from around the world, and she has raised over $850,000 for  urlLink pediatric cancer .   OK guys, this little girl is dying! But surrounded by facing-her-own-death, she still do for others! I saw on TV (I haven’t searched the website address for Oprah’s Show yet) how she was physically. She looked weak. But she knew how to encourage others. Well, you can find many of her links in the internet. Here I show you part of her  urlLink journal :   Wednesday, July 14, 2004 0:29 AM CDT  Dear Friends and Family,Well, once again I have waited so long to update that I do not know where to begin…We are still very busy with Alex’s demanding schedule, lemonade stuff, and family life in general. Looking back on my last entry, I would say that things are basically the same but she has had some setbacks this week. When I last updated, she was in the middle of her second round of oral Temador/Irino and we were hoping to see some signs that it was working (specifically her belly getting smaller). We did see some improvement in her belly, although not as dramatic as we saw after the first cycle. However, her mood was good and she reported that she was feeling well for most of her week off of chemo. Unfortunately, her counts have been suppressed quite drastically and she is requiring 3 platelet transfusions a week and 1 blood transfusion a week. She is also requiring Neulasta (a growth factor for her white blood count) in between rounds of chemo to help her white blood count recover. So, needless to say, we have been spending quite a few days at the hospital but we have managed to avoid overnight stays thus far.The counts have probably been the most obvious side effect from the chemo but she is having some other issues at the moment. She was successfully treated for a common GI infection (C-Diff for those who want the medical details) most likely caused by the antibiotic she must take everyday as part of her chemo protocol. Things seemed to be going okay last week, but over the weekend she took a turn for the worse, complaining of stomach upset, looking very bloated, and finally throwing up on Sunday night. She has not vomited since but has not been able to eat or drink more than little bits at a time due to a “full” feeling in her stomach. Also, over the weekend her bilirubin, once again, went up-- most likely due to progressing tumors in her belly or liver. So, here we go again… it appears that the chemo was working to some extent and it may still be, but we are worried that the tumors in her belly are growing again. She has started on another round of the oral Irinotecan but we are holding off on the oral Temador, hoping to give her low counts and upset stomach more time to recover. The plan, as of tonight, is to wait and see how things go over the next couple of days. If she continues to have these vague “belly symptoms”, she will probably have a scan to check things out; if things improve, we will continue with the chemo, adding on the Temador next week. Again, we wait and hope for the best.&nbsp;

       I’ve just watched “2001:&nbsp; A Space Odyssey”, a phenomenal movie that I’d been eager to see for a long time. I found the DVD coincidentally, inside one of my DVD’s-collector-friend’s drawer.   Well, I have to admit that.. it really was phenomenal. I still can't imagine how a 1968-movie-maker could make such special effects. Especially those with people-able-to-walk-on-rounded-wall-things and other beautiful computer graphics. Still I can't imagine its effects' making. Wish I could get information behind the scene or the making of this movie.   When I browsed in  urlLink google , I found about 631,000 links to this movie, and 314,000 links to Stanley Kubrick, the legendary movie director. The toppest search is  urlLink this .
