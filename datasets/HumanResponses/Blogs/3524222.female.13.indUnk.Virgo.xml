      Awaaaay from the darkening sky-!  Jewel. Yay. I like the way her voice sounds almost entirely different in her songs.  Haha Maxine's bugging me to get you to buy her stuff for no reason at all. And Leona wants Borrowed Heaven too. x) Nyaah.  I love you! Randomness. Don't you wish Friday would come sooner, hahaha.   Oh great. There was this wound thingy on my leg and it was healing. I just ripped it open again by cutting my leg against the cupboard. Joy.  I'm booored. Hope you're doing okay with your work.  I miss you. I won't be going for training tomorrow, so unless you aren't I guess I'll see you on Friday.  Love you baby. (:

      Such that cold sweat is running down my thigh in rivers. Oh shudder.  Haha. I want to go for the match tomorrow, don't think my parents will ask where I am or call back or anything. Even if they do I'll just tell my maid to tell them I'm in the toilet or something. Your school's so close to my home anywayyyy.  Oh the food at Ariel's place was heavenly. Her mother got this huuuge plate of sushi and stuffage. Chicken wings, beehoon, OH YES AND THE CHILLI WAS SOOOOO GOOD. It was really spicy.  Gasp once again, you have sordid love affairs with electronics. Oh blah, just as well anyway. I think I'm hopeless around them. ^^"  Am still somewhat sore and pissified over the Zhu Ting thing, but whatever. I never liked her since sec 1 anyway. Pbbth.   Gawdth. I feel half like going to sleep right now and not waking until tomorrow and half like staying up to watch soccer and talk to youuu.  Yay Eunice is nicee. Our resident ahgua. Ehehe. Oh man I hate it when people try to lesbian-seduce me.  Okay there's nothing much to say nowww, since I'm online and talking to you on MSN anyway. Squee.  Love you baby. Oh yea, and boo-! xD

      Hello.  Hi baby, I miss you so much you know? You're having training and the match now so I guess I wont be getting a reply yet?   kay I got up at 1040, my mom asked me why i didnt change and didnt make my bed. Weird feeling not brushing teeth, little disgusting too. SO YEA, NEW RECORD. Ive never been on the phone for so long, and never been up till so early either. Staying up with you was great, I guess its a whole lot better when I miss you and we're talking? especially when you were laughing alot and its just so much nicer to hear you happy.  Laugh more? I love it when you're happy and all you know? I feel bad for making you upset time and time again.  Im trying so hard. sigh and I dont know why I keep forgetting? Im just stupid I suppose.  I really love you. I really really do, so don't ever be unsure about that okay? I know I shouldnt make you upset in the first place, but when I do, its not that I don't love you. I just want you to know that.  Oh and the crazyness from this morning has gone away. I just smelt you again and Im hoping so badly that I can see you tomorrow. Just sit together some place and talk. Im never going to give up alright? I'll always be your birthday present, and I'll always love you alright? I know things dont seem to be going right? but theres so much to look forward to, dont give up okay?  oh and when I change my plan? Id choose 7pm to 7am so we could have another one of those long talks like we did last night, or rather this morning. Im kinda tired but I guess its worse for you, next time dont stay up when you've a match alright? you really must take care. I don't want you to die, if you do it wouldnt be worth living for me. sigh  kay I was getting depressed but your message made me smile for some reason. See, only you have that effect on me.   I love everything about you. (:  Kay I guess thats all for now, might be back later but Ive got tons of work.  catch you later my dear. I love you (:

      I don't know why I'm posting again here; I suppose it's 'cause I can't exactly tell you all this by messaging and I'm not going to talk to you until quite some time later. And even if I wrote this in a message it'd just spoil your mood for a movie.  I suppose I don't have any right to stop you from going out for a movie with your friends, and I ought not to anyway. But I really miss you a lot now, and I guess it's selfish of me to think so but I wish you'd stay home and talk to me tonight. It's alright if you want to go watch a movie badly though.  I probably can't go online later, so I won't be able to talk to you. And tomorrow I'm having a friendly against AES, followed by training, so I won't be online until 8 or so. I'll be doing work, anyway. Don't message me so much, 'cause your bill's getting really high and you might get scolded or something. I don't know if I'll be able to go out on Friday? but I suppose it doesn't matter. The worst is that I'll see you sometime after school reopens.  About today, I guess thank you for bothering to come over? and see me or something. I reckon it's kind of my fault that you went home late and got scolded by your mum and stuff so, sorry.  I miss you so much that I'm crying again. Heh you've got yourself some crybaby for a girlfriend. Kay nevermind.  Hope you enjoy the movie, then. I love you.

      You know yesterday, I commented on that poster thingum of the Jap guy at the back of Coachie's van. Something like, "he's quite good looking for a Jap"? Then Coachie said that since I was so concerned with looks I'll wind up marrying some guy with lots of pimple scars. -.-  Oh anyway when the others heard it they burst out laughing. Pbbth.  I really, really think Coach knows about us. But nevermind.  Yay Meowmeow smells so clean now. I just bathed her, and now she's dropping fur all over the house. o.0 dustmite feast. Eek.  And I suppose we shouldn't message so much? Because of your phonebill and all. Oh this sucks. Change your plan soon. >.  Gross. My right arm's all dry and peely 'cause of sunburn. You're supposed to come over today after the match and all? But since it's cancelled I don't know if you're still coming. I miss you so much. Bah this sucks.  Oh about the pics of the wedding? I like the designs on your shirt. At least your mother's willing to spend cash on an outfit for you, even though it's just for one occasion. Eegh I need new clothes. And my mother insists on buying skirts for me, so I'm evading shopping with her for the moment. Your sister looks like Nicole Ann Leong, you know? The girl we saw sitting at the bus stop after Dance Night.   AAGHH SHIT WHY DOES ACS(I) ALWAYS GET TO DO FUN STUFF LIKE *SWIMMING* AT TRAINING?! Urghh. You know it makes NY training seem utterly boring. But nevermind.  Did you know that Coachie's so proud that his paunch went down-! Ahaha yeaaa. He's been doing that ab roller thing and sit ups. Supposedly 15 of the roller thing, and 20 situps. Three sets everyday.  Damn. No wonder my stomach hurt. I did 6 sets in a row, without the situps though. Aack.  I wonder how long it's been since he last saw his toes. But nevermind. Haha.  We're having a friendly match with AES tomorrow, 9 or so. Blegh. Hope we trash them. Our sec 1s got squished by a bunch of little boys that aren't even into puberty. It's tragic I tell you. It was like, every hit was followed by error after error. The running was also terrible, they didn't know how to steal bases unless the base coaches screamed at them.  Oh ohhhh. I umpired too, you know? AHAHAHAAA. So retarded. The Chongfu batters kept talking to me, and saying stuff like "are you sure that's a strike?" and trying to act cute so that I'd let them off. Pfft.  Gawdth. I'm really scarred now. Aagh. At least my complexion doesn't look that bad. Whatever.  ...  Am having fun irritating my cat. She hates her tail being prodded. Ahahaha. It's like, it'll twitch from side to side if you keep poking it. Heeh. ^^"  Shall stop now. I shall try to finish some work before you come, or so. Urk backloggg.  I love you-!

But I want you to know that I really love you and all. Kay?  Sigh Hols coming to an end, we didnt watch mean girls, we hardly saw each other and Im just dreading the return of school. BAH. Come sunday night I shall drown myself in alcohol and skip school because of the huge hangover that I will have.   I Love You  I still have quite a lot of work, I'll do everything on thursday, if I dont, Im dead. Oh, I dont know whether to get dead letters or borrowed heaven. And and IM SEEING YOU TMR YAY. somethings wrong with me, Im not structuring my paragraphs. Everythings just coming out.  I Love you so much  WE MUST WE MUST TAKE NEOPRINTYS OKAY? Its like, Id like a picture of you with me. Its like those war movies where the soldiers look at pictures of their loved ones before they die. shrug kay nevermind.   I love you so so much  Oh yea.  MARRY MEEE. haha, and erm. We shall have LEX LOH AND ERM. KYNA? I cant remember the rest.  kay thats all.           I love you so so so so much.

      I'm baack. Still alive, but I think my body's falling to pieces. I'd make a list of injuries I have right now, but I'm too lazy. Haha.  Bah. Our timing's just so perfect. I come back from camp and you leave for Sebana. Kay nevermind. At least one of us is having fun, driving around in a little yellow car and whatnot.  I'm so hungry. And tired, I think I could sleep for more than 12 hours. Gaaah.  OH YEAAAA. Coachie's letting our sec 1s play against the Chongfu boys on Tuesday morning, 9.30. AHAHAHA. Let's go bully little boys ngwahahaha. Eek that sounds so wrong. >.  Anyway. Andre waited outside my school around 6.30 or so today, but he never saw us come out. Arghhh. We were let off around 7.15 'cause the seniors and Ms Ong happily decided to criticise us to no end about our behaviour and whatever. I'll tell you what happened during camp in another post la.   Hmm. Apparently Hui Tian's called err. "Teddy". Or something along those lines by my overzealous juniors. Ahaha.  OH OH YOU KNOW WHAAAT. There's this roller thingy that helps us train our abs? And I used it alot bwahaha. Now I can see this vague shapey thingum, but I think it'll go awayyy soon if I don't keep doing my sets. Sadness. T.T It hurt hokay. Like, 6 sets of 15. I thought my stomach was going to cave in. ANYWAY MY STOMACH'S STILL FAT BUT WHATEVER. At least uh. I attempted to do something about it. Hehe.  ...  SHIT I'M SO  SCARRED . NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  And I have tanlines EVERYWHERE. I'm sunburned. My complexion is uh. Pretty normal but that's beside the point-! Arghhh stupid turnout and PT. My ankle's ruined now. And I have too many bruises to count in too many places. My back hurtssss. My entire body's aching.  Whingecomplaincomplainwhinge. Ehehehehe.  I miss you now. Still, I don't feel bad or anything probably 'cause I'm grateful to be home? Uh yeaaa. I just wish I could see you now. And we could just sit and talk like your first night at camp. But it's okay now, I guess.  Ahaha this is weird. I'm messaging you and posting at the same time while waiting for my dinner. I'm supposed to have hor fun, but I think it'll come back all soggy and ugh. Kay nevermind.  Chu Ting   o.0 if anyone else ever finds this blog we are so screwed. But who cares. Fwee.  I MISS YOU I MISS YOU I MISS YOU I MISS YOU I MISS YOU I MISS YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUU.  Squee-! xD Alright I'll talk to you later. I hope you'll call or something from Sebanaaaa. Bye baby. Have fun there, or something. (:  Chu loves you! =)

      BOO-! okay hiii, Im high because i had starbuckss awhile ago. Why havent you messaged me yet? Its 1040 already. Kay nevermind, I miss you so much, and me and andre are talking. Haha he says monkey sent him an email yesterday morning and it was so touching he almost cried. haha  Okay so what did I do today. Got up at 10, had tuition at 1130 till 1. Ate lunch and did abit more chinese. gah still have so much work, heck since Im going to sebana this weekend. sigh wish you could come tooo. Didnt do much for the rest of the day until dinner, my sisters friend is staying over so my mom made beef noodles, good stuff. After dinner I went to thomson to get a cd for my dad and was contemplating getting you dead letters or borrowed heaven but I decided I'll get it some other time.  Oh the main reason why I went there was to get some complicated wire thingy to plug my ipod into the car. muahaha I am an electrical genius. So next time you dont have to worry when we get married because I can mangle around with tv sets and all. Ive been fixing stuff like that since I was in primary school. haha  Sigh you poor thing, having to endure ms ongs boot camp. To hell with her I say. WHY HAVENT YOU MESSAGED. okay its only four minutes passed. haha its the coffee. It was the beer the other time but nevermind.  Kay off to pack my stuff. COME HOME QUICK.

      First day of camp and I'm just about dying. You didnt message me in the afternoon and right now Im really looking forward to hearing from you. Ocean Avenue makes me miss you even more, for some reason.  Im just a teenage dirtbag baby. I really think I am. shrug  It really sucks that we cant go for your camp and stuff, if only you had someone like mrs yoon. Kay nevermind, it would be nice to hang out with you during camp more. Hope you get enough rest during camp, I didnt. Got up at 12 today thats why I didnt reply. Sorry. Had tuition and slacked the whole afternoon since my brain wasnt able to process any information today.  Right now its 725pm, Im not sure if the blog tells the correct time. Im going out for dinner, at least thats something to look forward to. BLACK ANGUS, its a must try steak restaurant at orchard hotel. Really good stuff, and not that expensive too. ohh, their ice cream with hot fudge is better than macs anyday. Haha.  Enough about food, I had a bloody nightmare last night. I dreamt huitian liked me. It was bloody freaky. I could have died in my sleep I tell you. She sent me an sms, 'I like you and I want you'. Shit I am so darn scared of her now.  Its stuff like that, that makes me lose my appetite. Oh, and this weekend you'll be away? I guess it alright since Im going to sebana, I think.  I miss you.  So much.  I wish you'd come home sooner.  and I wish ten years would come sooner.  and did I mention how much I love you?  well yea, I love you (:  okay pardon my strange paragraphing but Im not into putting everything nicer, I type out stuff the way my thoughts flow. Oh by the way, who's that junior of yours with short hair, quite tall? she bears an uncanny resemblance to lionel, weird. kay maybe not Im just weird.  hmph. You sleep in some other guys shirt. ): sniff.  kay nevermind it doesnt matter. Weiliangs okay la. But he's a little arrogant. A side of him you probably will never see because he acts differently in front of you. He thinks he's really good and all la. same for matthew ge, skipped training for the entire hols and comes back to boss people around.   Honestly, I hated the game yesterday, firstly, it was against all my friends. Like ganging up against them. But they played well la, better than the girls. And your seniors are really not up to mark. Argh and that darn psycho, I feel uncomfortable around her.   BERTRANDS NICE. He's close to me and andre. we were talking about girlfriends and he asked alot about you, like how long we've been together and stuff and how we met. haha. he has a girlfriend and was lamenting how it wasnt fair that me and andre had girlfriends in softball. Haha  Oh and yao zhong too, they're the only two that dont disturb us about having girlfriends. I think its kinda childish la.  Kay I think Ive said enough. come back quick kay? I miss you so much  yours lovingly. sernie

At least I'm not   Will be leaving for school around 7 am tomorrow, so I guess I won't see you online. Hope you rest well tonight. Camp must be tiring, watching the way you guys play and all. I'm pretty tired too, working non-stop and crap, but the parentals aren't cutting me any slack. Don't think they intend to, but I'll manage somehow.  These two months have been great. You realise if we marry in exactly ten years from the time we got together, it'll be the 16th of April, 2014? Haha. I'll be 24 then. Oldddd.  Why do you hate MattGe and Wei Liang. Isn't Wei Liang nice. He gave me a shirt, and that's like, my first OP article. Snort. It doesn't even fit, but I guess I'll wear it as a PJ or something. Hehe.  Do your work while I'm at camp? so that you won't have so much when I come back haha. I'm going straight to Hotel Meridien after camp ends on Saturday evening, so I'll be back home on Sunday afternoon or so. Maybe 4 or 5 pm.  Hey why don't you feel comfortable pitching wimme. I know I don't have those traffic light pants and all, but stilll. Ahaha kay nevermind.  Okay paternal's PMSY. I have to gooo. I'll message you or something during camp.  Love you. 'night.

      Just finished my second math specimen paper. YAYYY.  You know something depressing. My radio's been on the whole afternoon, and I'm hearing repeats of songs. I live a sad life.  Take off my clothes, turn out the lights. But I burn letters that I write; to me, to me you love me.  You do, don't youuuu. x) ahaha. Okay forgive me. I just had one whole afternoon's worth of math and EEK I JUST SMELT YOU AGAIN. In my parents' room. Oh this is so wrong. >.  Nevermind. After today I'll have another 900 free SMSes, although we ought not to message so much anyway. But I'll be in camp, sniff. *insert hysterical wail*   As the sun goes down, waking up my dreams, and in my mind you're with me once again.   Radio junkie-ness.  Kay whatever. It's going to be a long time before I ever talk to you online again, so yea. I DEMAND THAT YOU POST.  Nevermind. I'm too hyper. Maybe it's all the pent-up energy from staying home the whole day.   KTHXBYE MANX.   [edit] Hmmmmmm. I shall try to finish some drama monologue script thing by tonight. It's like, 2000 words worth of rambling to myself. o.0" whatever. Third math paper I'll try to finish before dinner.  OKAY WHY AM I EVEN *POSTING* THIS CRAP HERE. It's not like you're going to read it until Wednesday night. Bah who cares. It's our blog. ^^"   I miss youuu. Wish you were able to read this. I'll see you tomorrow before the NY/AC match. =) [/edit]

      I'm a supergoddess. Muahahaha.  No, I'm just hooked on Liz Phair. Oh ohh The Reason was No. 1 on the Rick Dees Top 40 for the umm. 3rd week running. Yayyy.  You're so random when you're drunk. Haha. I like it though.  What is wrong with people and me being like Christina. Can I slap them or something. They either  think I'm sexy  are blind, or they think I'm a slut. OKAY I HAVE THIS BAD FEELING THAT IT'S THE LATTER BUT NEVERMIND.  Am crashing at 4 am today. Sniff. I spent most of the day sleeping, so baby, thankyouverymuch I am still sufficiently nocturnal. Snarl.  Period's over-! YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY. Okay you didn't have to know that, but yea. I hate my happy days. And stupid Coachie doesn't help by singing that song whenever he sees me.   OH I BET THOSE GIRLS WERE STARING AT YOU. Hmph. I never get to see you when you're dressed up and stuffage. And those girls did-! Aaargh the thought. ._.  You know my Flash Boyfriend's friend is hitting on me. He tried to get me to make out with him, and I could choose "Snog me, love bunny" or I could tell him where to go. Ehehehe. Amusing, considering that his friend was hotter than the Flash Boyfriend himself.  Okay I better start on homework now, if I want to go for training tomorrow. Am crashing at 4 am, so if you wake up in the middle of the night I might still be awake.  Yay lessthanthree. x)

      Yay I feel high. Must be the alcohol. We took alot of photos, mostly group photos but I'm in it so its good enough. Oh mark's cool la, really hyper guy thats damn fit and all. He's freaking injury prone. Once in sebana, he cut his chin open on the slide.  Haha. Admund told me that his brother thinks you're like christina too. Haha. WHAT SHOULD I BLOG ABOUT. Shall I be mean and stop here and let it be an eensy weensy post. MUAHAHAHA.  (Its the beer)  SO YEA. I really wished you were there, it sucked seeing couples snogging there and I wish you were there with me tooo. Not so much about the snogging part? just being with you. There was this group of girls at the wedding that looked pretty presentable and all, AND THEY KEPT STARING. haha but it was damn funny 'cause one of them started talking and it went like this 'YOU KNOW HOR, LATER WE GO SIT THERE LA.', 'YA LOR, I GO FIRST, YOU QUICKLY COME HOR' stuff like that.   I can imagine their conversation containing 'WAH SAI' or something to that extent. Baybee, I miss you so much and the darn alcohols making me feel woozy. Everything's blur and Im not thinking straight. If I say something stupid it isnt my fault. OH YEA. NEVER DRINK WINE AT WEDDING'S BECAUSE THEY SERVE CHEAP SHIT WINE THAT MAKES YOUR THROAT FEEL WEIRD. but the beer was really good. My cousins were acting all gung-ho and going up to ask for alcohol and after a few sips they'd dump the drinks on me. And it was so cool because they served me beer. IM 14. bet they thought i was 21 or sth. haha  This is getting draggy. SHOULD I STOP? I think not. HOW COME NAT AND SOME SHIRA HIME PERSON CALL ME DAJIEFU AND STEPFATHER?? how come I don't know my family ties. IF I'M SOMEONES STEPDAD. THAT MEANS THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN.   WHO IS IT! TELL ME AT ONCE.  (OKAY ITS DEFINITELY THE BEER)  This is so long, and I have started using alot of caps. Thats not right. I'm like sitting here at the com, wearing my Beautiful sexy outfit, half pissed and wondering why my darling, who is supposedly nocturnal, IS SLEEPING SO EARLYY. It aint fair. When I want to sleep early, you stay up. But when I'm up, you go sleep. AHHH  i SHALL stop now. Oh by the way, our wedding? A beach wedding would be really fun. But maybe in BARBADOS or smth MUAHAHAHA. Ticket to indulgence 101.  OKAY IM MAD night I lUrVe YoU apologise for this crap post. ITS ALL MY BRAIN CAN PRODUCE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF YOU KNOW WHAT. love you (:

      Seems like I am, always recently. Mmph. And I'm sleeping more than I am on school days.  Your cousin, the Mark dude, is somewhat spastic. But I'd like to meet him one day. Traumatise the shit out of him, eh. He sounds so.. hyper. You know like, pre-pubescence hyper. >.  OH I WANT TO GO TO THE BEEEACH. You know when I was really young, I was perpetually stuck at the beach. Cycling or just sitting there. And once I fell asleep on the rocks and nearly fell into the sea? Haha. I'm retarded la. It's amazing how I haven't killed myself by accident yet.  Oh mannn. I bet Andre groped Monkey in the water. What a birthday gift. Ehehe. I guess religion's a touchy issue, but whatever. Snerk.  Eek. You know the person who died, I saw her a few months back? pretty damn alive too. Scary. I even ate her fried beehoon at some party. o.0" AHHH AND NOW SHE'S  DEAD . EEK.  So freaky.  OKAY WHAT IS UP WITH ANDRE. He just said that I reminded him of Christina Aguilera?! Oh he says I'm poseur. ph34r t3h p0w4r 0f t3h l0w s0X. *kabishes him* HE SAYS I'M POSEUR EH. WHO'S FROM ACS(I), I ASK YOO. =/ Urk stereotype.  Bah he can go and dieeee. Stupid prat was smirrrrking away when I was batting. Horritigibible thing. I bet he isn't half as mean to Monkey. *goes off to sulk in a corner*  No la. I think his lifelong ambition is to aggravate me until I die from aphyxiation or something. Either that or he'll sneak into the girls' toilet and dunk my head into the toilet bowl until I drown. ._. so depressing.  Think I shall sleep early today. And watch the idiot box, for once in a while. Hmm. Hey it's like, two long posts from meeee. You'd better post a decently long one hokay.  Kay shall go now. It's already tennnn, and I bet you'll probably return from the wedding at 11 or 12 or something. I'll probably be sleeping then? but you could call my handphone, I guess.  Pray, pray pray pray that Shan Loong won't call me. The dude jibbers for hours on end. Twitchshudder. Even I, the almighty natterbox can't match up to him.  'night babyyy. I love you-! Yay randomness.  ...  You know what. On hindsight, I don't really mind Andre being reminded of Christina Aguilera when he talks to me, because Aguilera's sexy. BUT I'M NOT. Okay nevermind. I shall delude myself into thinking that I am. And uh. Boost my ego ehehehe.  lyk, gdnite manx-!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111111oneoneone.  [edit] Man it sucks missing you so much. I'll try to finish more work tomorrow and go for training on Monday? or something. At least I'll get to see you, and embarrass your C div more. x) 'niiiight, for the last time.

      Eekz0r. You know yesterday, after my 8 km run, I have acquired a nice, somewhat dried out blister over a previous blister.  What joy.  Hmm. PoA wasn't all that good, but I suppose it's passable. You smelt really good the whole time though. Clean and stuffage. Heh yay.  Oh and you never finished my coke. Nyaah. I told you two large cokes were just too much, and you wouldn't listen. Urghh those hotdogs. >.  Urk. I have training tomorrow morning, and that kind of sucks. Don't know when Monkey's party/gathering/whatever is though. You'll be at Sentosa, I think? at least there's some lavish wedding for you to relax at. I'll be slogging my ass off tonight and tomorrow afternoon, if the gathering's at night.   I've been playing too much.   Gee, like wow. Now you realise, Chu Tingyz0r. -.-   *slaps self* Okay off to work. I miss you so much now. AND YOU CAN'T HELP ME WITH MATH AARGHHH. Nevermind. Shall enlist the help of the all-knowing, Orchard-going Maxine.  Oh stop it about Beethree already. Pbbth. I was an idiot. Okay wait I'm still an idiot, just not so much of the INYOURFACE kind.  Yay go watch Mean Girls wimmee. After hols? Or something. Blah. Stupid nationals. I think softball's going to make me and break me. Someday.  Okay bye.

      Sigh. Just watched The Day After Tomorrow. Right now, I miss you so much its killing me. Felt weird watching a show with my parents, first time in three or four years?   Today wasn't as bad as I expected. Got a haircut which turned out strange, looks fine but just isn't me. I suppose going for the show cheered me up a little, after all these few days have been bad for me. I guess it isn't as bad too since I get to see you tomorrow and stuff, but its never enough and I still miss you.  This is weird. I'm talking to you on msn and blogging. I guess its easier to write everything down and let you see it. I was thinking a lot during the show, especially about this posts title? stuff like that.  Its a scary thought, I just don't want to ever come to a point when we see each other for the last time. I love you, I always will. The thought of you leaving me is just so frightening. sigh.  I'm sorta neglecting you on msn? I guess I ought to stop here for now.  Loving you.

      Joy, I'm sick. Full out fever, cough, sore throat and flu.  I wonder how you didn't catch those. Like hello, we snogged more than once. ._. surely that's enough to pass SOME bacteria, at least.  Hey I'm short too hokay. T.T Are yoo trying to say that you're prejudiced against mee. Mmph fineee. *daos you*  ..no la. ^^"  I hate being sick. Allow me to launch into a long-winded tirade on why I Hate Being Sick.  I can't stand having my nose blocked and running. It's like, every five seconds I need to blow my nose on a tissue while I idly wonder if I'll die of dehydration from all that fluid lost through mucus. Okay fine I'm being gross now. >. feel  my brain swooshing around to the other side of my skull and hit the bone, then I have to wait a few seconds before my brain settles down again. o.0 it's a eerie sensation, I tell you. Might be just the headache but whatever. And my skin feels all raw-ish, Nat says it's got something to do with hypersensitive nerve endings when our temperature's above normal? or something like that. Hell yea my temperature's above normal. -.-  *whingecomplaincomplaincomplainwhingecomplain*  Ahem.  Gwen, hobbit?! Uhh like, kaaaay. Must be the curly hair and the height la. She's my Twink, you know. We both read this book pretty long ago called Regina's Song, by David Eddings. It's about these twins, Regina and Renata. They were really close and stuff, until one day one of the twins got raped and murdered in front of the other. They don't know which twin died and the surviving one went nuts. Mm yea, and 'cause no one could tell the difference when they were young, everyone just called them "Twink".  Hence Gwyneth and I and the TWINKIES. Ehehehehe.  Freaky book. But whatever. David Eddings is a freaky person. In a boring way, I suppose.  Ehh why am I telling you about books and crapz0r. SEEEE. I may be sick but I still ramble a lot. No maybe it's BECAUSE I'm sick that's why I'm rambling. Yay.  I want fooood. I realised that I've been eating so much during the Dance Night frenzy, but somehow I don't feel terribly stuffed or guilty or anything. I don't even look fatter. o.0 Urk weirdishness.  I pray that my metabolism has sped up. *worries over self in the mirror bimbotically*  You know I hate guys. Like they can eat around four times what a girl can eat and still don't grow fat. Rawrr. And this is why fat girls are forgivable and fat boys aren't-! Heeh.  Oh yea, speaking of fat boys. I saw Mia last night, I told you on the phone, didn't I. >.  Can't you return sooner. -.- Kay neverminddddd.  Hmm my horoscope this week is queer. Something about how if I note small things in my life, I'll realise that things are picking up? And for you it's something about having a clash with someone in your family that has a problem with authority.  Shudder. How scarily accurate heh. Sunday Life!. Go see.  Okay this is some super long blog entry. Shall go blog good and proper at the other now. I suppose Obsidian's being neglected 'cause of Dance Night.  Oh ohhh. I can't fill in the blanks. First line is "I love you", I think? Haha yea. My brain's not working now.  I'll talk to you later, I guess. Byee.

      HI BABY. Just had a coke and Im rather sleepy. I had fun tonight.  Now you know not to be mean to me at night, because I can tell scary stories. Haha, but Im not going to be so mean because if I am, someone's going to DAO me.   No offence to your friends, but Nat reminds me of tinkerbell. And Gwen, a hobbit? Kay nevermind why am I prejudiced towards short people.  Your dance was pretty good, especially with all that booty shaking. COUGH. You have interesting friends you know. Much more interesting than mine. None of my friends have muses in the eco-pond and all.  ANYWAY, don't be so scared of the dark, there isn't anything there to be afraid of.  Kay I'm off to sleep. Night. _ ____ ___. __, ___ ____ ____. (:  fill in the blanks.

       Important, significant reasons.   - You're not in denial. Unlike certain people like coughAndrecough. - You're hot. Face it, Jade was happily stanching her nosebleed when she saw your back profile. Ugh the lusty girl. - You're sexy. So good with your hands that it sucks sometimes. >. - You're honest. Most guys are liars la, kay? They'll just say anything to make girls happy. Okay wait for a sec, do  you  do that? *fisheyes yoo* - You're so naive, and it's awfully cute until it hurts. Ahahaha. So maybe I did pollute your mind, but whatever. Isn't it better this way, mm? (: - You're more mature than other guys. Well at least you don't harbour those silly prejudices that so many males have. - You're not a male chauvinist pig. That's important kay, because I'm a feminist. Nyaah. - You're able to tolerate my nonsense-! Yay, haha. I guess not many people just listen without judging me. Or at least, guys. - You always, always make time for me, even when you're busy or whatever. I guess I really appreciate that? because even though I'm talking about my problems or whatever that don't concern you, you still listen anyway. (: - You don't try to change me. Or impose your opinions on me. Because I hate it when people insist they're right (even though they might be) and shoot me down immediately without listening? Mm yea. At least you accept me for what I am.   Not-so-important and sometimes silly reasons.   - You play SOFTBALL-! Yayyy. Like what, common sport that we can both rave about? Not that we do a lot la, but whatever. At least we have excuses to get together ngwahahaha. xD - You have such gloriously long fingers. Cough. 'Nuff said. - u dun type lyk dis manx. harharx. lyk, sho kewliez lorhx. - You listen to the same type of music as I do. Like, radio and stuffs. - You tolerate watching chick flicks just 'cause I want to. Oh yea speaking of movies, I want to watch Mean Girls. Muahaha bitchay show. - You're older than me. I have this.. thing for older men. OKAY WHATEVER. I suppose one year doesn't really apply but it  is  an insignificant reason afterall. ^^" - You're fun to gossip with. Especially about people that we mutually dislike. Ehehehe. - You get along well with my friends? Yea I suppose. It's insignificant la. I wouldn't mind even if you didn't get along with my friends. Whatever. - You're rich. Okay that doesn't matter, but yea. - You don't like ruggers. AHAHAHAHAHA. *rubs hands gleefully* Kay nevermind. - You're not stingy. Like, you don't insist on taking money from me for movie tickets? Although I think I should pay you ANYWAY. It's not nice to have you pay all the time. - You're good with your hands. In the pervy and non-pervy sense. I'm not that horny all the time kay. - You're not a stereotyped ACS(I) poseur d00d himbo! Yay. Haha. Even though it wouldn't hurt to care more about your appearance, but at least you're not obsessed with it? Mhmm. But poseur in the appearance form is alright, just not the attitude.   ...  Okay I think I'm done. Ehehe.

You don't have to get it for me, you loaded rich boy you.   You know when I say blog properly, I mean capitalisation as well? Ergh I just hate the look of small "I"'s.   Cringe at my nitpickiness. Heh. On a random note, I smell pretty good now. Not that caked-in-make-up kind of sickeningly sweet smell I was just now, but just clean and fresh-ish smell. Yay.  Okayyy. I shall hmm. Blog at my other blog. Mm yea.  You said you'd buy more thongs for me kay-! I'll hold you on that. Ahaha the joys of having a rich boyfriend.  ..yuck that makes me sound so materialistic. Shudder.  Hey let's go watch Harry Potter sometime soon. Like, when I'm feeling less guilty about the my holiday homework? and dissuade your mother la. She won't come hunting for me and ask me to stop associating with her son, will she. o.0" eek.  I shall find a hole now, just in case she does.

       I suppose I am not much of a person, and you see that.    &nbsp;  In all honesty, I'll tell you that I really do  not  look down on other people for any particular reason; I don't place myself over others and you probably don't believe this but I swear I don't.    &nbsp;  I don't mean to sound rude when I talk to Coach, for crying out loud, why would I want to be rude to him? I'm just plain pathetic, that being obvious, and I can't help seeming that I'm proud and shit.    &nbsp;  Actually, I can. Oh yea I'm screwed up, I've known that from the start and I haven't done anything about it.&nbsp;My mother's right, I'll be left by the side all alone one day, because everyone who cares the least bit about me is going to be sick of my attitude and the way I treat others.    &nbsp;  I'll tell you what I am. I'm scared. All the time. I'm terrified of being embarrassed, when I do I either laugh it off or I snap at others to make myself feel better. I never admit I'm wrong until I'm forced to, I suppose you already know that. I get nervous when I feel that others can figure out my train of thought, and I don't tell anyone anything because I know I'm a lousy person, and I'm scared of letting other people know how lousy I am. Oh yea, and I half-joke and half-insult others whenever I discover a weak point of theirs.    &nbsp;  Maybe I'm no better than Joleen.    &nbsp;  Yay. My phone bill just arrived; SMSes&nbsp;are alright but I exceeded talktime by way too much. My phone might get confiscated. I suppose that just adds to my list of joys at the moment.    &nbsp;  Sigh. I love you too, on MSN. I don't know how much longer I can take this; parents scolding, tests, doing well, making choices in academic paths and other assorted shit. Hell yea it sounds angsty, but it's not like there's a way to say this without it sounding like I'm going to take out a rusty penknife, slit my wrist while writing mournful half-rhyming poetry. I still haven't done my work, and I don't intend on finishing it anyway. Ode to literature and Shakespeare.    &nbsp;  I'm practically begging&nbsp;now, I wonder what happened to pride.&nbsp;All the gods, I'm sick of myself. I'm so bleeding dependant on other people that I need external motivation to get by. Or even if it's internal, it's triggered by something else. I don't know. I need you now, more badly than ever. Although I don't really see why you should even bother with me in the first place, with me being such a horrible person.    &nbsp;  And half the time now, I wonder why I haven't accidentally killed myself or gotten myself shot or throttled by anyone yet.    &nbsp;  I suppose my wallowing in self-pity and angst doesn't matter. I'll turn all hyper and happy-positive on it sooner or later, it might help me get by and deal. For now I'd just want you to know that I really do love you, no matter what you think. And I'm thankful that you love me.    &nbsp;  So thankful. I love you.

       Here goes.   This is going to be the&nbsp;first time I'm going to be&nbsp;completely honest about a conflict, and it&nbsp;hurts.    &nbsp;   Firstly, at NUS, I was PMSing for no apparent reason. I don't know what got over me, but somehow I just got irritated by everything. Directly, I took it out on you.     &nbsp;   That was fucking awful of me. And even though I knew it was I still did it anyway, I don't know why. It's only the past few days that I realise I'd let my temper get the better of me, and I don't want to lose you because of something like that.     &nbsp;   That's my major problem, admitting that I'm wrong. I reckon you've noticed; I have a copious amount of pride and that gets in my way of doing things. All the times I've gotten mad at you it's always you apologising, even though certain things&nbsp;I get mad at are really quite trivial. It's about time I learnt that I can't smart off things that are my fault and place the blame on others. I've been doing that my whole life, and I never really lost anything terribly important until it came to you. Like I said, I asked for it, so I can't really blame karma or whatever. I'm the problem; it's me I have to fix.     &nbsp;   It's not that I never realised that I was wrong from the start. I did, and I was too proud to ever tell you straight that I was wrong, right from the beginning. It's like some stupid secret that I keep from the whole world, but the whole world already knows.     &nbsp;   I have a loathsome nature, I suppose. And I don't know how you ever managed to love or still love me.     &nbsp;   I don't blame you if you don't love me anymore. It's kind of hard to love someone after seeing their totally ugly side. I suppose I was never a very beautiful person to begin with, but it takes a lot out of me to write this down, and have someone else to read my shame like that. It's probably too late now since I've hurt you so bad, but I just want to write this for the sake of letting you know. It's obvious from the start that you wanted to give up on us because you very well knew that I was refusing to admit that I was wrong. And all that hurt that I've been feeling the past few days was deserved on my part.     &nbsp;   I suppose now I'm losing you for my pride and my refusal to ever say that I'm wrong. I've hurt you too badly for you to ever turn back, and I'd marvel if you even gave us another chance. I loved my pride, but I love you more, and my love for you's probably the only thing that's able to make me bring myself down like that. I just wish that somehow, you'd find it in your heart to forgive me for all the crap that I've said and done all this while, although I really don't see how and I reckon I should burn in hell for this. Both stupidity and pride, anyway.     &nbsp;   I don't know what I'll do without you. And I don't want this to end like that, not over something so stupid as me. I don't know how you're going to take me back, I don't know whether you still love me, but&nbsp;I swear by everything I've ever held dear in my life that I'm hoping you do love me, and that you won't leave me now. I'll change for you, I'd do anything for you. The irony, I'm admitting that I'm wrong sincerely because it's you, not my parents, not my friends nor anyone else that&nbsp;I've wronged.     &nbsp;   I don't know what I could possibly do to make things better. Nothing, I guess. I've gone too far in hurting you this time. You're probably sleeping now, and you won't read this until much later. All I can say is that I love you. So, so much.

Amanda just switched sides and deserted me on the elective hist pure lit side. ._. I feel.. ditched.  Forgive me. My brain is functioning at the speed of a sushi.  I suppose you can conclude that's not very fast.  I think I'll do some work and take a nap too. I slept for 15 minutes during lit without my teacher noticing, heeh.  Such a model student. Anyways. Off to bathe. Love you baby.

      My eyes hurt. Maybe I'll go blind again or something.  Oh yea, and I'm in school now.  I don't know. Since you didn't feel comfortable or anything yesterday, I'm sorry? I just don't like it when you always concede and say it's your fault. Like you think it'll make me feel better or something if you keep saying it's your fault and apologising, because it really isn't.  Kay nevermind. I'm not talking sense. Haven't been since last night.  Forget it. I'm having a really bad headache now. Maybe I'll die or something before reaching your school, but it's not like you'll read this before the match so I might very well be dead when you read this.  Nevermind.  I still don't understand why you take all this crap from me. And if you say it's because you love me, I don't know. But I really do love you. A lot. Maybe too much for my own good, but then again everything I do is bad for myself anyway. I'm like, ruining my life with every decision I make.  I just hope that being with you is going to be the only right choice I make in my life, since everything else seems otherwise.  I love you.

      Sigh hey. You're sleeping now. Its 11, you probably wont call then.  I dont know. Im sorry about today? I just feel really sad when you think my stuffs more important than you cause it isnt. Nothing will ever be more important, alright? and it wasnt that Im not happy to see you, its just that there were so many people there? kay nevermind.  I miss you so much now, I really do and Im just stoning and waiting for your call. Sigh, you got upset with me so many times recently. sigh I feel miserable whenever I think of that, and I keep thinking about those dreams, it just sucks. sigh  I haven't been posting, and this isnt really going to be long. so yea I apologise.  Its three months next week, fast isnt it. But somehow I think ten years is long, Im not sure if you'd really want to be with me in ten years? what if I become really unreasonable and stuff. sigh  kay forget it. I love you so much, you seem to forget that when you're upset. sigh nevermind. I love you alright? I wish I'd see you soon? and have some time alone. Its like, all the time we get together is when there are a lot of people around us.   If you see this tonight? and Im not answering. It means Im dead or sth. I havent been getting enough sleep, I guess you haven't too. Get more rest okay?  I love you. so so so so much. sernie.

      Shakespeare and his c(o)unt-ry matters. Tskk.  Ahaha you know today Eunice and I were comparing what we ate. I ate a shitload of food today. Err. Lessee.  During recess I had chicken cutlet, guava, a waffle and chocolate milk. Yayness. Then after the game, back in the boarding school I had instant noodles, chilli tapioca chips and Twisties.   I am doomed to be fat, as bananas are to extinction. Pbbth-ness.  I miss you so much. You know, thinking about the time I spent at your place makes me really happy? I never thought I'd ever have a chance to spend so much time with you. Or rather, I expected your mom to hang around a lot, so we wouldn't get a chance to do anything.  It was great. I guess that was probably one of the happiest hours of my life. And your house is really huge. And it's nicely furnished, not all mixed up like mine. One doesn't wonder why I don't enjoy going home.  And the world's just turning and no one sees (what, love?); and now's time for us. Maybe forever, seconds into minutes into hours (into days. No one knows I suppose)- and it's so pretty, when it twinkles, in that little-star way (goodness, there's still some of it- of course it's busy going round and round and being distressed since no one ever sees it.)(Hah, attention seeker.)  and you hold my hand it makes me want to cry just being with you.  So maybe I'm just down there and I don't know why you love me anyway but you do, so.  I've always loved you; and I know I always will.  I'm so random I think I shall die sputtering nonsense one day. That doesn't matter. Being random is fun.  You know when I miss you, I think about how you love me and it all gets better? Sometimes. But other times when I'm really down I get more upset and I'll start moping around. Whenever I think of you now, it just feels so funny and warm and fuzzy knowing that you love me too.  Don't fret over the video too much? Just get it over and done with tonight, and make sure last minute stuff like that doesn't happen too much again. I suppose I'm not in any place to chide you about it since I take last minute work to extremes, but you need your sleep.  I wish I could fall asleep in your arms again. Hey that's the second wish in my life that's come true? haha. Waking up and seeing your face gave me the nicest feeling in the world, and knowing that I'll see that every morning ten years from now just renders me childishly happy.  Ahaha I'm so silly. I'll go do a little of the Home Ec research paper now? It's like. some 1500 word essay on Diet and Heart Disease.  Who cares if heart arteries get clogged up. Don't eat too much chicken rice and everything will be fineee. Pbbth. Stupid Singaporeans.   Have to go. Bye baby, I love you. (:

      HEY. haha lucius is so funny man. I seldom see him being so funny? haha he must be in love.  (: I just read that letter thingy you wrote? and its really sweet. (: I love you so much. and I dont ever want anyone else? Im still in disbelief about what happened over the past two days. Things are perfect when Im with you, and Im prepared to put up with your nonsense for my entire lifetime cause we love each other so much? haha kay nevermind. Nonsense being trying to tickle me all the time. heh. Ive read that letter thingy five over times? haha  Since you reminded me. I shall do a sub post, its really random unlike your really organised one. here goes :Reasons why Sernie loves Chuting. -'cause you're you. (vague, but yea)  -You love me so much even though Im clueless and all.  -You somehow always know how to make me happy  -Even though you're rather stubborn and all :P, you still listen to me? I suppose its bad of me to want you to listen but usually what I say is for your own good. (Man I sound so father figurish)  -its nice to know that someones thinking of you when you're thinking of them.  -you're really smart and you've taught me so much that I would never have learnt if I didnt meet you.  -Im not the flavour of the week. kay thats lame. I just heard the song. But yea, our relationship isnt some bimbo-himbo two week thing. Its more of something thats going to last forever.  -Did I mention you're hot? I see guys checking you out all the time. And you've got a certain attitude, unlike certain people who dont have their own identities and stuff. hm I smell bacon.  -You're so damn sexy. shall not elaborate or I might go astray.  -You're really honest? sometimes maybe too honest but its better than lying anyway.   -You're hot. haha  -You're matured. really matured, mentally and all too. haha  -You're always there when I need someone to talk to and all.   -You still love me though im full of nonsense. haha.  -I really respect you 'cause you really serious about work and all. unlike me but as Ive mentioned Ive become more hardworking thanks to you.  AH JUST SMELT YOU. BACK TO BUSINESS.  -U dun type lyk dis. haha stole that from you. but yea, I really think that the english language should not go through such horrifying mutilations.  -This sounds stupid, but you could say we're made for each other.   -You have nice friends? people like jade that set their cats on me. haha but yea. I really admire the fact that you've kept your friends for so long.  -You're forgiving. Ive pissed you off so many times but at the end of it all. You still say 'goodnight baby. i love you'. heh (:  -You do sweet stuff for me, like putting reminders in my phone and writing letters.  -lastly. You're my girlfriend. And wife to be. And I dont ever want anyone else. plus, ive signed nats contract. haha kidding. You're all I could ever ask for.    KAY DONE WITH THAT. but I think you wont like it. Anyway. thats all for tonight. I had such a good time you know?  Night love. love you love. sleep well love. love, sernie.

      I'm boooored. It's ITE now, I haven't done the silly website that was due HMMMM. A MONTH AGO. >.  Bah. I'll finish it pretty quickly. One always has the advantage of iFrames. Heehee, said Dolphus Raymond, evidently taking delight in corrupting a child. Okay I'm being random again.  I HAVEN'T FILMED THE STUFFAGE FOR THE VIDEO EDITINGGGG. I am one screwed girl. I have quite a lot of work this week, and my teacher just said the website's due tomorrow. Yea thanks man. ._.  On a Monday, I am waiting; on a Tuesday, I am fading. It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real.   All the pieces, pieces, pieces of meeeeee.  Can you tell I'm really, really bored. Uh huh.  I don't care. You'd better get a Starhub line soon so that I can use the online SMS thing. Cheapskate-ness.  ARGHHHH THERE'S SO MUCH WORK TONIGHT (WELL ACTUALLY NO. THERE'S NOT MUCH WORK I'M JUST BEING LAAAAAZY.) AND I DON'T WANT TO DO IT BUT ALDGJOSDBKLMSRKHJSPDOJBESLRKGWLAKFHADG.  Sniff.  Yay Creed and Three Doors Down and Coldplay and whatnot. So nice.  Alright ITE's over. I'm going to the library to print some Diet Analysis crapz0r before going home.  Hold me when I'm here; love me when I'm gone.
