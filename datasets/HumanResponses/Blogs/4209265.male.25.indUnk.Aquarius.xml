      Hurrah here's the second coming! Went to Borders to get some books but ended up with more CDs than books instead. Got Sparklehorse- Goodmorning Spider, Modest Mouse- Lonesome Crowded West and the highlight of the catch: Pentangle- Early Classics! Only one book: "Plagues and Peoples" by William H. McNeill. Maybe not as enthralling as Jared Diamond, but this book should interest me for 3 days. The Sparklehorse CD is good, if you like whining beautifully textured rock like Mercury Rev. Modest Mouse is OKish, raw catchy indie americana with full of attitude. Hehe, but the winner really goes to Pentangle.     You see, I have this soft spot for folk music. And I don't mean Eva Cassidy and ilks. I have this somewhat romantic notion of a lonesome troubadour sitting on a boulder and strumming to the setting sun. Well, this CD reissue by Shenachie simply hits the spot right where it palpitates. The music is so earnest and so "folk" it almost makes you swoon along to the gentle intricacy in its simplicity woven. Really, the voice of Jacqui Mcshee is angelic, well she really looks like one on the cover. That drawn out far away look... sigh... And speaking of which, the music has a very traditional English folk appeal to it, which is like an even older The Fairport Convention variety. You can compare this to Lindisfarne and even Clannad, by listening to those fantastic tracks like "Let No Man Steal Your Thyme", "Trees, They Do Grow High", Hunting Song"and "Pentangling". This one goes into my book as one of my hot favourites in folk, notwithstanding Nick Drake (which goes up there as the most unfairly under-rated legend in the history of music!)...  Hmmm, this is probably something that can be enjoyed by me and my parents, for once.

      Sojourner... No, it's not that Mars Pathfinder. You guys are rerouted to here by mistake. Go stick to your Carl Sagan or that one in the wheelchairs. And yes, please take me with you to one of your cosmos outing as I don the galactic membership on my Star Wars t-shirt, with pride. Alright, this is getting way off tangent my friend... let's head back to that mundane plane known as the world wide web! Really, Sojourner goes beyond my nasi-lemak, your Lexus and those evil bacteria I'm manipulating in my laboratory. This one is a little respite tucked in the virtual desert of the real, and it whimpers defiance when every seeming communications collapsed within the boundaries of reality. Sorry for the geek talk, let's get on with it.  At this little corner of the world wide web may you find things that truly rock my world. Yes, I am heavily into the arty farty aspects of life and you may find those living testimonies wriggling at the right sidebar. Here I am in the comfy of my abode in somewhere known as Chippendale in Sydney, typing away at the cold heartless keyboards and listening to "The Days of Wines and Roses" CD from Dream Syndicate. This is the real Paisley underground classic and you can hear them sucking up to Velvet Underground, and knowingly realise how much of Sonic Youth is really DS reprisal. Oh, sorry but the truth hurts sometimes.  Well, minutes after this posting goes up into the blogspot server I will be embarking on that proposal for my Honours research. I shouldn't bore you with the details but it is not really boring for a science person like me. I will be heading down to the bookstores tomorrow to get my dirty hands on even more science books just to slay some time away. You see, I am really destined for a lifetime membership of geekdom but that does not mean a cerebral fix. Or maybe a lobotomy. And what about hours ago? Yes, I was at my friend's lounge in the Unilodge strumming away at "Summer Wine" and other oldies classics. Perhaps they find me a troubled troubadour, or maybe just a troublesome trite? Perhaps, perhaps...
