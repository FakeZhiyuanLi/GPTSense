       Its Sunday, and I am haunted by the fact that I will have to go to work tomorrow morning.  This weekend seemed short.  I didn't really do anything with any of my friends.  Friday night I fell asleep.  Saturday I went to my brothers lacrosse game.  And tonight I hung out with my mom; which was actually really fun.  Don't go see De-Lovely.  Poorly directed, poorly produced, and just ew.  So after seeing that with my mom we went to Sushi Kyoto, which is a totally awesome sushi place just across the street from the SMU campus, off Hillcrest.  It is   so   good.  I am full of spicy tuna and california rolls.  My mom is a cool person.  Shes actually my personal hero, on days I like her.  she's awesome.   Well I'm going on a trip to Michigan this weekend for a week.  Family reunion, and a 21 hour car drive.  I think I can work it into my mom to get me a ticket to fly with her, cause she's going a day early and I want to go a day early IN A PLANE.  Not in a car with 3 smelly boys, and my brothers girlfriends.     Morgan better call me from the O.A.R. concert.  We didn't get to see each other at all this weekend.  How sad.  I really miss hanging out with him.  We talk everyday, its so nice.  He was all sad today talking about how he's gonna leave and we won't be able to hang out once he leaves.  Aw... why couldn't I have met him sooner?   This will be a short post because the rice that was around the sushi rolls is expanding in my belly....so I'm tired and very full.  Adieu

      this night always has a way of getting me down.&nbsp; Morgan is busy, I miss that kid we haven't hung out in perhaps five nights.&nbsp; That my friends is a drought when it comes to&nbsp;Morgan and I hanging out.&nbsp; We do call each other everyday though, and leave messages if we don't actually get to talk.&nbsp; I had a dream last night and he was in it for only a second, and his hair was in a low pony tail and it was pretty darn cute - I think I am inspired.&nbsp; We will have to check it out later.&nbsp; Anyways so nobody ever picks up the phone to call me, so I'm at home on a friday night watching TGIF on ABC with my parents.&nbsp; WOW thats a good time let me tell ya.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Work was odd today.&nbsp; It wasn't very amusing, I didn't laugh very much.&nbsp; Alex what happened?&nbsp; Its your job to make my job go better....&nbsp; I got really annoyed today when I went home from work today for lunch.&nbsp; Everyday I come home to tell my mom, there is no food to eat.&nbsp; And everyday she does nothing to change the situation.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I come home today, and she says to me do you want&nbsp;me to make you a sandwich?&nbsp; With what I think.&nbsp; There is nothing worth eating in the refrigerator.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I make toast, one piece with peanut butter and one with butter.&nbsp; Now thats a  great  lunch.&nbsp; Please note the sarcasm. &nbsp; My dad got all mushy with me today whilst we were watching TV.&nbsp; I was making popcorn, and he walks over and gives me a hug and tells me he loves me.&nbsp; Not as though its a rare occasion, but, its hard to explain so I'm&nbsp;moving on.&nbsp; He goes on and says,&nbsp;"you know I don't think I will be ready to let you go next year.&nbsp; I'm about to have to face the reality that Will, even though he is not the brightest person at all times, is leaving for college.&nbsp; And thats tough, and I don't think I'm gonna let you go away.&nbsp; You can go to a junior college for a couple years maybe, so I can get used to it."&nbsp; By this point he looks as though hes got a couple tears in his eyes.&nbsp; Well I say I could fail out if you like....he says no just go to a junior college thats all I would like.&nbsp; End of conversation.&nbsp; Hmm&nbsp;well moments like these confuse me.&nbsp; Also&nbsp;kind of make me feel bad.&nbsp; I'm not that great a kid.&nbsp; I'm no stellar student.&nbsp; I&nbsp;will just leave it at, I don't think I am what my parents&nbsp;really wish for.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Gah, why do I have no self confidence?&nbsp; I wish&nbsp;I was more happy with me.&nbsp; I think I needed a sister growing up.&nbsp; Being surrounded by boys stinks when your little.&nbsp; I got beat up a lot, and called fat and ugly a lot.&nbsp; Maybe thats why I can't take compliments, maybe thats why when I think of my self all I can think of is fat and ugly.&nbsp; Maybe I am...I don't know, because thats all I can ever see.&nbsp; I am constantly thinking about what others think of me.&nbsp;  &nbsp; You know what is really annoying to me even though I know its true.&nbsp; When I complain about never having a boyfriend, I always get "your time will come."&nbsp; I   know   my time will come, but would you please just let me complain about it.&nbsp; I like making myself feel worse, OK? &nbsp; Well I've been thinking about posting my journal on my AIM profile information.&nbsp; This meaning that anyone of my friends or whoever can just look at my sn info and read this.&nbsp; Do I want that or do I want to keep my readers down to Alex and whoever clicks on his link to my page?&nbsp; I think some people would really be confused about me if they read this.&nbsp; I don't really want people to tell me that I'm wrong or try and "help" me if they think I'm having problems.&nbsp; Because I deal with the stuff I write in here everyday.&nbsp; I just like this blog thingy because its a good way to track events, and vent.&nbsp; It seems like everyone though has an online journal these days.&nbsp; Do I conform to the trend of allowing all to read it, or do I keep it semi-private?&nbsp;  &nbsp; Arg, so Alex hasn't called me back.&nbsp; I wanted to meet Roni, and his friends.&nbsp; But I guess hes doing other things.&nbsp;  &nbsp; How do you know who is truly trustworthy? I've struggled with this lately.&nbsp; People I think I can trust with things don't end up being able to show me they are worthy of my trust.&nbsp; There are things I want to know if I can trust certain individuals with, and I think I can, but I don't want it to be ruined in the end.&nbsp; That was really confusing but actually very simple.&nbsp;  &nbsp; My brother is going to college.&nbsp; This was brought to the foreground of my mind again today by my dad.&nbsp; Thats wierd.&nbsp; Well not wierd, but I don't know its hard to describe what I think on this matter.&nbsp; When I try and think back on Will when we were younger, I can't think of a single memory, no fun brother sister times.&nbsp; Except at his commencement ceremony.&nbsp; I was working out on the floor where the seniors would pick up their diplomas, and as he walked by he turned to me and said "Give me a hug" and he gave me a nice big brotherly hug, and it made me cry.&nbsp; But its odd in the sense that Will and I don't have many brother sister memories.&nbsp; Sure he will always be my big brother but, I think I missed out on some bonding times with him.&nbsp; I'll never know about that.&nbsp; Maybe it will grow with more time.&nbsp; I keep telling my parents when they get sad about him leaving that hes not dying, but I don't think I realise that myself.&nbsp; He's not going away forever.&nbsp; Hes just a few states over, at school.&nbsp; I can't wait till I can go visit him.&nbsp; I'm so ready for college.&nbsp; There is so much "high school drama," as Will would call it.&nbsp; I'm ready to try living and life on my own.&nbsp; Without curfews, without someone walking in the door or peering over my shoulder.&nbsp;  &nbsp; This brings me to a question I've been wrestling with for a while.&nbsp; I know that I am going to A&amp;M, but do I want to be in the Corp of Cadets.&nbsp; Do I really want to go somewhere were I will again be scheduled into a box?&nbsp; Or should I do the regular dorm life, and have to make my own butt carry the load.&nbsp; I'm spending a day with the Corp later on this summer so I think then I will have a few of my questions answered.&nbsp; I wrote a lot so, Merry Christmas

      well I think I need to do some clarifying.  I ended my last post with my simple pleasure, and saying things like I would like boys to tell me I'm beautiful.  This was in no way an invitation for certain not single boys to hug me at work, and freak me, and others, out.  First off the boy has to be single, if he's gonna tell me I'm beautiful or what not.  No wait, before that he has to really mean what he is saying.  You can just say it for kicks, that doesn't make me feel any better.  And yeah well I think Josh was freaked out when he saw me recieving the hug from a certain someone, and it was totally unneeded.  anywho.....  MAN, I hate coming home from work for lunch, and there is no food.  I mean theres food in my house, but I'm lazy and I don't want to have to make it.  Why can't it just be ready on the counter when I walk in the door?  AUGH SO ANNOYING!  CEREBELLUMED! Speaking of which I haven't been to homestarrunner in a long time.  I need to do that today.  I love me up some teen girl squad.    OO I just remembered!  Today is Thursday, so I have lacrosse tonight, but.....my coach is taking us to ( sounding of trumpets ) PEI WEI! I love Pei Wei, give me some spicy chicken salad, and I'm good to go.  YUM I have found my motivation to keep going thorough this day!   If you could wish for one thing what would you wish for?  Ask me my wish, and I will tell ya

      As I had previously mentioned, tonight was my first Wrangler performance, YAY for country western dancing.  So Justin and I are waiting to go on, and we're excited to be dancing together and lalala whatever.  The music starts people all around are smiling and enjoying the dancing.  Well we get to the ever so tricky wrap around stunt, and I get dropped on my head.  Surprisingly - it didn't hurt too badly, or even at all.  I got up and missed the next two counts of a sit dip but was right back to dancing.  These things happen.  After the Wranglers finished their 3 dances, a guy camp up and began to lead these line dances and this Barn dance - I had sooo much fun.  Maggie and I were goofing around, and then Justin and I danced some more.  I miss Mrs. McKown, I used to take counrty western dance as a class in school and she was the crazy teacher-I've never seen a woman over 50 use her hips better, it was uber fun.  Justin and I were two stepping, and tripple two-ing, we even remembered the Lariat.  This means nothing to you Alex and all my other readers, but it was cool.  Justin is an awesome guy, because he was honestly sorry about dropping me on my head, and I knew it and he made sure to appologize and make sure I was ok with the evening.  Cool kid.    I'm excited for next year, as a senior.  Its gonna be a good year.  Fewer classes=more fun=WHOOP!     It was a good day today .   So work is going to be really long tomorrow because I have no more 2 and a half hour long interruptions.  I miss John Woolfolk.  I know I just totally botched his name, but anywho he used to work at the Eagles Nest.  Come back John.  ....or is it Jon? I dunno but he was a cool kid.  Summer has gone by really fast, almost too fast.  oh well these things can't be helped.    I thought  alot  today about boys, and my lack thereof.  I have too many guy friends, and not enough boyfriends.  Today was a boy crazy day.  I feel so fat and ugly on days like today, because I'm all alone and all my friends have boys to cling to - but there are none for me....I usually end up screwing myself over though.  I'm wierd sometimes, why do I do the things I do sometimes?  I had two opportunities this past school year we will call it, where two guys showed their interest in me.  First one, I dunno I just freaked out. Well there was actually a period where I dated a boy here for two months, but we will just skip that.  My semi-second chance, was recently with a guy whos leaving for college.  I just don't want to date someone who is leaving.  Is that bad?  I don't really know.  I want a boy to tell me I'm pretty and to give me hugs.  my personal simple pleasure: big strong long lasting hugs

      I'm at work right now, how fun is that?  My first Wrangler performance is tonight, yippy skippy!  I just hope I don't screw it up and fall on my face in front of a bunch of people.  The performance is downtown, and its an exchange club convention for all the exchange clubs all over the US so all these people are supposed to be coming, and the guy who arranged the Wranglers to perform is supposedly   really really   excited about the Wranglers performing.  Too bad there are only like 10 couples in total who are going to be there...I'm so out of shape.  We've been practicing for the past two days and we have another practice today, and we run through the dances like maybe 15 times each - but I get so tired and worn out from doing it.  At lacrosse practice last night I worked on some long passes with the goalie stick, after not having used a goalie stick in perhaps 2 and a half months, my shoulder hurts.  This is full of whining - cool.  Well, what else is there to talk about in life.  My stupid car, and the stupid backing it into the gate means I have to make over 500 dollars working, so I am here all day, its not too bad.  Alex and Josh keep me laughing, Carly and Christina are crazy - so it turns out they both have smoked and thats wierd, I would never have pictured either of them doing that, I need to have a Spidey sense that can pick up wether or not people have smoked.  That would be cool or just really funny.  I want a puppy, would you like to give me one?  So here is my question of the day: I for sure want to go to A&M, but do I want to be in the Corp of Cadets?  How hard is it, physically wise, to be in the Corp?  I don't know, so why don't you tell me.  And when I say you, I mean I don't really know who - because I don't know who's actually reading this, except for maybe me.  OK so I'm being really unproductive today at work.  I'm doing nothing and still getting money, its not like I'm complaining but, I wonder if they really want or need me working here.  Well, I need the money, so I'm gonna go do something. Ciao

      well as I didn't make known, I was in Michigan last week for a family reunion. Or shall I call it my mothers way of making her feelings for her new stepmother known. Eh, it was a quiet week, rather dull. Other than that I feel like I've missed a lot while I've been gone. My cat died - had a heart attack. Damn him, had to die while I was gone. I don't even get to see him one last time, just some freaking ashes. What do I do with ashes, I can't pet them. They won't sleep with me at the end of my bed. Well I guess they could...but that would be rather gross. I miss White Paw. I can't even believe he is dead. I guess thats how people feel like; wait let me say I'm gonna be morbid for a while ok?; when their family or loved ones get in a car wreck and they get all smashed, where there is nothing left but like their glasses, and somebody calls and says that their family or loved one is dead. You can't and don't believe it. It must be in human nature to have to prove everything. Thousands of examples, I know you can think of one - I don't feel the need to type one out for you.  where has summer gone? I guess I squandered mine whilst in Italy, or at Pine Cove, or working, or in Michigan. hehe squander....not really but yeah. I didn't ever get to layout, get a tan, spend the night at a friends house, stay in my bathing suit for over two days and not ever feel the need to change; no fair.  So I went up to good ol' TC's today to meet up with Rach, Katie, Aust, and Cali. It was wierd. I feel so out of the loop. First off I was in jeans and a black shirt with makeup and jewelry on, not just the usual two rings, but like huge earings and some bracelets. They were all in like soffes and t-shirts. I don't really hang out with Aust or Cali much but I do hang out with Katie on the nice occasion that she gives me a call; I never call people. So I don't know what to say around them really. I just kind of sat there, it was quiet. I don't like quiet when I'm sitting in a car with three other people. The convo went like this:   your in jeans Sheryl, were in shorts  Katie talked about going to Tim McGraw  well crap school starts soon  .....  what classes are you taking?  .................  Katie says well I have to go....well I should go too then I guess....Katie says we need to hang out more, and I think to myself I hear that from everyone, right? I guess thats what floaters get. meh   So, that was a good 30 minutes of me feeling like the pimple on my chin. I wanted to burst out and talk but I didn't know how to get out there. Get it?  Francine Rivers is a good writer, she keeps me interested in her books. They might seem to start out slow but after the first ten pages your hooked. You want to know whats gonna happen next. Ah almost like a mystery but not a mystery at all. I don't know what I am saying.  Do I go back to work tomorrow, or not? I don't want to, but I need the money. What do I do. I have a job lined up for next year so I'm not pressed into going back tomorrow but it would make things easier later on. Ah....I think I will sleep on it.  I need to learn not how to eat just because there is a cabinet in the house that might have food in it. I know I'm not hungry, but its there so why not just stuff it in my mouth. It also might be good to go outside, ride a bike, take a walk or even get this go for a jog!?! wow that would be crazy - maybe. ok I think I vented enough
