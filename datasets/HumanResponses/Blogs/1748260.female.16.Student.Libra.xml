      Now listening to Good Charlotte's The Anthem. *It's a new day but it all feels old. It's a good life, that's what I'm told. But everything is all juz still the same.* Haha, really it seems the same everyday anyway! But it's a lil' bit different today. Well, I juz came back from church. This afternoon I was havin' a dilemma. Go to Jen hse then Church or go back to school for band? Oh ya, today's Camilla's birthday. Well happy birthday cow junior! Hehe.. After all, I chose to go to Jen's hse then go to church. Today had service coz of dedication service. Had a special speaker. He's about 90 plus years old. Still strong man! Well, after church ate handmade noodles again. Hahaha. You may ask, "Not sick of it huh?" Well, it's delicious. Haha but kinda bad today. SO MANY SMOKERS!!! Argh.. Almost spoilt my appetite. Moreover, today when I was walking to my place. Some woman was smoking & I didn't know. The smoke kinda irritated my eyes & it was damn painful I almost fell. Argh, inconsiderate smokers. As I would say, kissin' a smoker's like lickin' an ashtray!

      I juz thot that today would be a fine day. Anyway my blog puts it's 28 Oct. I dunno what time zone they follow. Actually it's only 27 Oct.Now it's 11.26pm. Alright, juz now I went to Jen's house. I took the bus 53 & changed to the bus 315 since the bus route for 53 changed. But the way to Bishan is slightly longer for the bus 53. *sigh* Anyway, the bus 315 took quite long to come today. Then when I got up the bus, a couple was like kinda staring at me. I was like thinking, "Damn! What's their problem man!" Ok, after looking at them for some time. I kinda like made out what were they talking about me. "Girl or boy? (in chinese)" Well, I was wearing some blueish-green cap. But c'mon it's so darn obvious I am a girl! They also think that I don't understand what are they talking about. Well, when I got down the bus, they still looked outta the window & stared at me. I stared back & gave them this kinda "sour frowning" look. Ok, I thought that was the end of it. I went up to Jen's house, yak awhile. Then I told her about what happened in the bus. After that, we decided to go down to Serangoon Central for dinner to eat hand-made noodles. Coz the one at Serangoon Central's really delicious & filling. $2.50 & yet it's a BIG bowl. Haha. Then when the 315 bus came, we got up & GUESS WHAT?! I saw the couple again. I was like darn it. Coz this time I took off the cap & wore my hairband when I was at Jen's house. I whispered to Jen that those 2 were the "PROBLEMATIC SOULS" juz now. Ok.. the girl kinda like saw me & whispered to her boyfriend. BLAH! I was thinkin' "Oh man! What is this?" Ok forget it. I guess they muz be saying. "GIRL LAH!" Haiz..dunno what's wrong with 'em also. Thank God I had some patience & I was trying to endure, or else I dunno what might have happened. Oh yea, today I took the temperamental test at  urlLink http://www.xenoscleveland.org/temperaments/temperament_test.htm  My sanguine rate was 26 (the highest), followed by Phlegmatic which was 7, then Melancholy was 6.. HAHA choleric was only 1! Hmm... funny eh? Well go take the test & see what you are then!

      *Yawn* Seems like it is such a beautiful morning. Though I know I'm gonna rot at home. Nothing better to do! Haiz =| No activities. No job. No school. Blah. Seems like this few days people like to rummage through my wallet. And the first thing people "attack" for in my wallet is my neoprints! That's why the place where I put my neoprint in my wallet will always be a mess! Esther Porkie.. looks like this time you're gonna get famous through my neoprints. Each time I take neoprint people ask who's this & that! Hmm, but Esther looks different in every neoprint! Wahaha agree so Esther? I really can see that you're a neoprint freak yea? Takes neoprint all da time.. Woohooo.. Then I also realise that many people in friendster love to say "LOVE YOU TO BITS" Haha, I thought it was love you to the core. Now its to bits eh? Sounds kinda cute. Maybe I should kinda like go with the flow & say it too or something? *Laughs*

      Linkin Park - Faint  I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact That everybody can see these scars But what I want you to want, what I want you to feel What it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you To just believe this is real So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do Face away and pretend that I'm not That's all I give cause you're all that I've got  I can't feel the way I did before Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored Time won't heal this damage anymore Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored  I am, a little bit insecure, a little un-confident But you don't understand I do what I can Sometimes I don't make sense I am, what you never wanna say, but I've never had a doubt It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do You face away and pretend that I'm not But I'll be here cause you're all that I've got  I can't feel the way I did before Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored Time won't heal this damage anymore Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored  You hear me out now You're gonna listen to me like it or not Right now, hear me out now You're gonna listen to me like it or not Right now  I can't feel the way I did before Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored Time won't heal this damage anymore Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored

      All the colors of the rainbow All the voices of the wind Every dream that reaches out That reaches out to find where love begins Every word of every story Every star in every sky Every corner of creation lives to testify  (Chorus:) For as long as I shall live I will testify to love I'll be a witness in the silences when words are not enough With every breath I take I will give thanks to God above For as long as I shall live I will testify to love  From the mountains to the valleys From the rivers to the sea Every hand that reaches out Every hand that reaches out to offer peace Every simple act of mercy Every step to kingdom come All the hope in every heart will speak what love has done

      You tell me no one would love you If they could see deep inside You say your friends might desert you If they knew the truth you hide, well There's one who knows you better than  You know yourself And he still loves you more than anyone else  (Chorus)  Jesus doesn't care what you've done before How you've rebelled or slammed the door No matter how far you've run or how long you've been untrue Jesus doesn't care He still offers forgiveness to you  For so long you've run from the Father Into a life of sin And each time He lovingly called you You turned your back on Him No matter if your failures are great or small There's no way to hide them He already know them all  (Repeat Chorus)  How many tears will you cry Till you cry out to the Father An honest plea for mercy He will not deny Trust Him and you're gonna find  (Repeat Chorus)

      The fact that I'm in love Hoping I was with you  In heaven up above  I'm too scared to ask you I'm too scared to try Every time I see your face The thought runs through my mind  I can't help but think about you It's not the way I thought I'd fall I didn't think that it would be Where you don't think of me at all  I know I'm not much In the eyes of perfection But, the only thing I long for Is a little of your affection

      Fine day... alrights... now listening to the band song by Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra.. the piece... Beauty & The Beast... Nice song! Hehe... got a new handphone + m1 line today... Nokia 3200.. the one which Shu Ai called as "6 eggs" handphone. Alright whatever.. I don't go for looks.. I go for functions..Juz pray that this handphone don't get lost huh.. like the previous one.. that was a very bad experience? Ok... I shall talk about what happened today.. Could not sleep in the night before... due to some reasons I guess..Maybe coldness? Slept only for around 3 hours plus & overslept.. woke up at 7.30am when i was supposed to wake up at 6am? Reached church late for 8am service... arrived at 8.30am instead.. It was so damn funny today ok! When I reached the mrt station it was like "NEXT TRAIN 9 MINS" ... It always happens... and I juz loathe it.. Both services the sermons were the same.. talking about FAVOR... whereby it stands for Faithfulness, Anointing, Vineyard, Offspring & Restorance...Took Amy's car down to orchard where she parked her car at Taka. Went with the youth today to orchard... had lunch at wisma.. where I ate some hakka yong tau foo noodle... & ordered another plate of yong tau foo again.. lol.. people who know me well would jolly well know that I've gotta big appetite... Walked around orchard after lunch...next stop was Topshop..where Amos got so obsessed with his ps2 game that he almost didn't wanna leave...So we walked down to mac first & bought vanilla ice cream cones...After mac..we walked down to CK Tang where we bought a few stuffs... then on the way we stopped at the Giordano in Lucky Plaza for awhile to look around..after that we went to Paragon where I went to see the handphones.. argh.. feel so bad.. made the rest wait for me.. the next stop.. Amy wanted to get something from Louis Vuitton.Arriving at Taka, disappointingly, the shop only allows a certain amount of people to be in the shop.. weird I didn't know until today.. what a "suagu" I am! So she decided not to go in.. as there was a very long queue... on the way I talked to Amy & realised that she stays just opposite me.. What a surprise.. Haha.. ok.. then she drove all of us home...On the way home Amos told me that PLANET SHAKERS IS COMING TO SINGAPORE... During the march holz!! Ain't it cool? Anyway, Amy did not believe at first that I stayed there too.. haha...Ok I came home.. and slept awhile.. counted my money, and went handphone hunting.. The handphone shops at heartland mall were closed so I tooka train down to hougang mall where I got my Nokia 3200 from a handphone dealer.. it's so much cheaper than the ones I saw at paragon.. Glad I did not buy from paragon.. Thank God... :)

      So bored... nothing to do again! I'm talking to Benedict"a" Ong on the msn.. it's so silent it seems that very little people are online..Benedict"a" Ong is confused with his choices again urlLink   .. First he said he wanted to go to Catholic Junior College .. haha if if he were to go there.. he'll see Su Lin..Lei Hong.. that groupa band seniors..then he said it was too far .. He was posted to Outram Institute.. I think.. or was it Jurong.. I can't remember.. sorry if I made a mistake..he wasn't very happy with his posting...So he appealled.. Alright when he appealled he was re-posted to Serangoon Junior College.. in which he said HE LOVED IT & was determined to stay.. Alright if he was staying.. he would see my ex band seniors... Jasmine Tan.. Ya Ling ... plus the npcc ma'am.. Alvina and another ex sec 4 Endurance girl? All currently in J2? Ok whatsoever back to the topic..Now he's like saying he's confused whether to stay on.. Poly.. better JC or stay on... blahz... I asked him whether he liked hands on work or academic.. he said both also can.. alright.. I had nothing to say.. then I told him about how a diploma is better as if a person fails his/her a levels.. it would be goners! Haha.... I was speechless when he said.. JC have my favourite subject. I said what? He said FM... I didn't know what it was at first.. he said Further Maths & I was like.. eee.. ok.. hahahaha... I loathed maths so much! Alright I forgot that Benedict"a" is a maths cum yoyo freak yea? LOL....Orry seems to hate Anglo-Chinese Junior College so much that she has stayed with that permanent nick that says "   acjc sucks - orries   " .. And I've seen a few ex sjc-ians .. some are doing fine in Jurong Institute while some of them are complaining that the lecturer sucks.. Emily's doin' fine in Millenia Institute.. glad to hear that...  Ok it's like 1 plus & I'm still not out of the house yet? What's up today? Not going to anybody's house? Another boring day? CRAP! Haiz....

Sad to say.. today's another boring day... only the uncle & auntie.. plus their son came... and we didn't go out... plainly boring... *sigh* .... Oh yah.. another thing... did not know that their gonna change band conductor.. Mr Tan L.C.'s no longer the conductor for CHIJ St. Joseph's Convent Military Band..Seen the news from Jacqueline's blog.. Sounds sad huh... heard that alot of people cried. Man why did they hafta change again? In my 4 years with the band, they changed for like freakin' 3 times? Now they wanna do it again. I think their mad. And wait.. why did the conductor hafta do with Jasmine Tan? Can somebody please enlighten me or something? Glad I did not choose to stay in the school. What if it's another one like Madam Wu... I'll scream! Now I even wonder whether I should or I will go back for a visit .. Juz imagine.. another conductor.. who does not even know you.. go back for band & you look as if you're some "musical" stranger? How awkward can it be! :x

      Another day.. not that bad actually... but kinda boring.. went to uncle's house as usual.. usual practice on the first day of CNY... well I listen to my parents talk to my uncles & aunties.. while I was rotting on the chair.. Then I tried to sleep & was awakened by their loud voices.. Ok nvm.. I attempted to sleep again.. kids(some of my cousins' children) started playing games in front of me. Alright I give up. I took out my handphone played bowling.. Haha the sound effect it gave out made so many people look back & stared at me. Soon after... we went home.. we were at the house for like about 3 hours? Yupz... But my brother left halfway to go to his girlfriend's house to visit her parents. Bet he's got more red packets than me now.. -.- Hehe.. ok ... tomorow I'll be going to some parent's friend's house & I hope it's not boring.. :P

      Voice of Your Heart by Lily  Tchen  urlLink     When you think about life And all its negative things, Scary thoughts occur, Great fears it brings. Dealing with friends Who betrayed your trust. Standing alone in the rain From dawn to dusk. Losing the man With whom you wished to share your dreams, Leaves you with eyes like clouds And tears like streams. With family members Arguing from day to night, Makes you want to run away From that unpleasant sight. School is hard, Doing work you don’t understand. Walking down a road Holding no future in your hand. Your world is dark, Empty and confused. You feel angry, frustrated, And completely used. Everything is unclear, You only see death on the way. This life isn’t worth living, It should be taken away. But then there’s a small voice That suddenly appears. Looking all around... you Can’t seem to find it anywhere. This little voice said, “There’s a whole lot more to life. Everyone goes through joy, Happiness, pain and strife. There are people who love you, And you will meet new friends. Everyday is a new experience, It’s just a matter of where and when.” That is when you calm down And begin to think. After all, life can be good And have its positive things. You can have an education If you’re willing to learn. You’re future is the road ahead, Considering which way you turn. You have been hurt, Betrayed, denied and used. But people will know your importance Depending on the kind of friends you choose. Not having a boyfriend Isn’t the end of the world. He’s not worth loving If he leaves you for another girl. It’s normal for a family to argue, ‘Cause that’s how they compromise. If you think problems can’t be solved Then you’re not very wise. This little voice saved your life- Didn’t keep you and the world apart. That’s when you realize this voice... Is the “voice of your heart”.

      Jars of Clay - (Faith) Like A Child    Dear God, surround me as I speak, the bridges that I walk across are weak Frustrations fill the void that I can't solely bear Dear God, don't let me fall apart, you've held me close to you I have turned away and searched for answers I can't understand  They say that I can move the mountains And send them falling to the sea They say that I can walk on water If I would follow and believe with faith like a child  Sometimes, when I feel miles away and my eyes can't see your face I wonder if I've grown to lose the recklessness I walked in light of you  They say that I can move the mountains And send them falling to the sea They say that I can walk on water If I would follow and believe with faith like a child  "I've got joy like a fountain!" "Be kind UNTO others" "In Jesus Christ Your son"  They say that I can move the mountains And send them falling to the sea They say that I can walk on water If I would follow and believe with faith like a child  They say that love can heal the broken They say that hope can make you see They say that faith can find a Savior If you would follow and believe with faith like a child

      Yesterday was another pissed off day! Lookin' at my blog.. where's January 2nd? Yes.. my parents did not allow me to use my computer after coming back from church.. well this happens almost everytime.. Biasedness .. I juz hafta endure ..  Ya but I  failed to do so last night & flared up. I was suppose to check the directions for ITE Clementi & try to get there today. Sadly... looks like my plan's ruinned. And I wonder who wrote some crap in my shoutbox. Chatted to Sabrina (jie) yesterday on msn.. after about 1 month? Guess she must have enjoyed her tour around Europe. Michelle came for youth suddenly after disappearing for some time from youth. Desmond came back from travelling.. not sure where.. so he came for youth too..Now it just seems that everybody's sick. Me... I've caught flu I guess...People who are reading my blog, I have a special prayer request.. Pray that my appeal for the course will be successful? Thanks .. I believe God do miracles...

      HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!! Watchnight service was great! Before that we had to come to church early at 4pm .. Coz all of us thought that Rowena's mum would come & test the make up for us..But end up she came only about 7pm.. So we rotted in the room!! LOL.. Then there was this "xiang ba lao" (shan't reveal who) thought I DID NOT HEAR WHAT HE SAY.. "See now u know why I dislike her" Ok.. He was saying to his LOVER GIRL.. A girl who is not even his lover & only someone he likes.. HE ALWAYS STICKS TO HER LIKE GLUE.. Look at his freakin' hair & stupid specs.. Plus the childish shirt he wore .. ACTS CUTE YA SEE ..Can u imagine? HE REALLY LOOKS LIKE A "XIANG BA LAO"!!!!WAHAHALet's see... there was so many special numbers & stuff.. The group from Elim (Tampines) sang "We are the reason" .. testimonies from certain peeps .. showing the goodness of God .. OF COURSE .. the skit was a success .. Loadsa laughters were heard from the audiences (ponders *why*) Haha .. guess it must be because of the cast .. Well everything was fun.. everything was nice .. I walked with Jennifer & Amanda Quah to Potong Pasir station & only to realise ... THERE WAS STILL THE LAST TRAIN! We managed to catch it.. Thank God .. Jennifer dropped with me at Kovan .. walked to the nearest 7-11 & got a cup of lemon tea(big gulp).. After which, we walked to my house & from there, Jennifer took a cab to Marianna's house.. wherease some other youths went to Esplanade instead..

No (C-type)  21) Your relationships never lasted longer than  3  months. A. Yes (G-type) B. No (F-type)    The Results:  \ A-type: Cinderella Type Just like Cinderella, you were the heroine of a  beautiful and happy love story in your former  life. This does not mean that you were born with  this privilege or that you necessarily had this  happiness until the end of your life. You  actually witnessed the harshness of reality as  child, including the loss of your parents and  poverty.  But all this darkness disappeared the moment you  met the love of your life and a new bright light  started to shine toward your way. You ultimately  gained happiness and honor through love.  Both of you genuinely loved each other and  enjoyed a blissful life for a very long time. It  is just natural that this genuine life in your  previous existence can only be a blessing in  this  present moment.  This may be the opportunity to work for charity  by helping out other people in need and to be thankful.    \ B-type: The Charitable type You were the devoted lover in your former  existence that dedicated your whole being to the  object of affection. When you fell in love, you  forgot about everything else including your own  self.  You experienced a lot of pain because many  people  took advantage of your kindness. All your lovers were beautiful people  but they possessed narcissistic qualities, which  was the result of your breakups. Their  selfishness never allowed them to return the  love  that you continuously provided for them. But you  never despised them for the wounds they left on  you.  What you should do in this life-time is to  become  more sensible, rational, and calculative, so  that  you will not have to endure so much pain as you  did in the past. Don't just settle for anyone  who  crosses your path but wait patiently for someone  who will provide you with a reciprocal love.    \ C-type: The Lascivious type You were a very fickle person in your previous  life, who could not stay with one partner for a long time. Love was something  you had to experience through as many people as  possible and only then were you happy as a  person. You met many, diverse people whom you  shared an intimate relationship with.  Although you were an amorous lover, you  possessed  a cold and rational mind. It gave you this power of never being hurt by  someone. It will be difficult to settle down  completely for you unless you meet a very  charismatic person that will capture your entire  heart. And a journey for you would not  completely  end with marriage either.    \ D-type: The Reckless type You were the center of a love triangle or an  immoral love that was destined to end  tragically.  Your rash and independent spirit set the stage  for a love story like this. You were an  egocentric character who broke many people's  hearts. In this way, you were much like the C- type that was previously mentioned. You moved on  from one person to another as soon as that spark  or passion for you faded.  A person who existed as this type in the past is  bound to be affected by these remnant qualities  today. This is why it is vital to appreciate the  other person in your relationship now and to  become more mature. Getting rid of your selfish  desires may be the key to a happy relationship  for you.    \ E-type: The Romeo and Juliet type You are one of the few people who experienced  the  most passionate love affair in your former life.  It was love at first sight and both of you could not think of anything else during the day than  to  dream about each other.  It was a Romeo and Juliet love affair, which may  not have ended in disaster just like in the  story. Your families may even have been very  accepting about your relationship. But the  likelihood of a passionate love increases the  more obstacles are between the two lovers. But  the affection tends to fade when there is no  conflicting element involved.  Therefore, it is important for you to be more  patient in your present relationship. The  challenge is to keep that passion going by  constantly introducing new and interesting ideas.    \ F-type: The Plain type You did not find love through your own actions  but with the help of other people. You were in  your own comfort zone, so that it was not  necessary for you to find someone special. This  is why you were far away from experiencing a  fervent love affair.  Everybody accepted your relationship with your  partner and stability may be have been the  pivotal characteristic of your love. Many people  would not even consider this peaceful and simple  relationship to be love but it may just be the  true essence.  You may feel perfectly comfortable with an  arranged marriage.    \ G-type: The Abusive type There is no human being who perfect and  therefore  a certain contradiction exists within us. Thus,  an internal conflict between cruelty and  kindness  is apparent in us.  You were familiar with this conflict in your  previous life, where mistreatment was used on  people. There was a lot of anger in you and this  may be a reason why you were open to challenges  without a blink of an eye.  You often found this sardonic pleasure when you  made a person feel sad or perplexed. Monotony  did  not exist in your vocabulary and so you looked  for excitement. A little child exists in you  that  is waiting for stability and you have shot at  finding love when you find the person who is  able  to provide this comfort for you.    \ H-type: The Glass Marble type You were a purely naive person who was scared to  be hurt. This led you to love a person from afar  but the chance that you came together was very  slim.  You were a sociable person but oddly enough, you  became the shy and quiet person in front of the person you liked. The  painful event occurred when the day your object  of affection became another person's mate and  moved to another faraway place. You have to  accept the fact that you will not see a  relationship in the future if you don't start  gaining some courage to make that crucial  advance. You can start with taking subtle steps  toward that person

      Daniel Beddingfield - If you're not the one  If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?

If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?  I don't know why you're so far away  But I know that this much is true We'll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you're the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life  I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

      Clay Aiken - Solitare  There was a man, a lonely man Who lost his love through his indifference A heart that cared, that went unchecked Until it died in his silence  And Solitaire's the only game in town And every road that takes him, takes him down And by himself, it's easy to pretend He'll never love again  And keeping to himself he plays the game Without her love it always ends the same While life goes on around him everywhere He's playing Solitaire  Another day, a lonely day So much to say that goes unspoken And through the night, his sleepless nights His eyes are closed, his heart is broken  And Solitaire's the only game in town And every road that takes him, takes him down And by himself it's easy to pretend She's coming back again  And keeping to himself he plays the game Without her love it always ends the same While life goes on around him everywhere He's playing Solitaire  A little hope, goes up in smoke Just how it goes, goes without saying Solitaireee And by himself it's easy to pretend  He'll never love again Ohhh  And keeping to himself he plays the game Without her love it always ends the same While life goes on around him everywhere He's playing Solitaire Solitaire, solitaire

      Gareth Gates - Say it isn't so  Skies are dark it's time for rain Final call you board the train Heading for tomorrow I wave goodbye to yesterdays Wipe the tears you hide your face Blinded by the sorrow  How can I be smiling like before When baby, you don't love me anymore  Say it isn't so Tell me you're not leaving Say you changed your mind now That I am only dreaming That this is not goodbye This is starting over If you wanna know I don't wanna let go So say it isn't so  Ten to five atleast we tried We're still alive but hope just died As they close the door behind you Whistle blows and tons of steel Shake the ground beneth the wheels As I wish I never found you  How can I be smiling when you're gone Will I be strong enough to carry on  Miles and miles to go before I can say, Before I can lay my love for you to sleep Oh, darling oh I got miles and miles togo Before anyone will ever hear Me laugh again

Then my ah Hui & Fang mei also dunno where they chabut to already...oh yes.. back to the details for the day.. Went with kawaii kor to 7 eleven after the 8am service.. Then went back to 10.30 service... Jen-o never come again!! I'm juz so sad.. everybody seems to be backsliding..After service we went to Marina Square to eat. Some took bus.. I took You Xin's car!!! Cas..Joanne & Ro was on the car too. Some others took Beng Huat's (dunno how to spell his name..unsure whether it's correct) car.. while some took bus & Benson rode his motorbike. Guess what? We thought Benson would be the first to arrive. Upon arriving, You Xin called Benson's handphone & he picked up saying he had some accident. Then Jeremiah's group arrived ... the group which sat on Beng Huat's car...well Jeremiah called Benson's handphone too. Benson said he had some concussion.. couldn't really remember what happened before hand & actually called Amy & said "Is today Good Friday?" Well... guess he had a shock. Ok.. we bought our food. I ate Ban Mee.. the famous Qiu Lian Ban Mian stall :D .. After that..I drank my Justea Ice Tea with Lemon.. & after we makan finish.. we left for the hospital. This time I sat in CJ's car... together with Cas. O yea.. & Ro too..but she followed CJ to meet some VFC people I think..Few of the youths were at the hospital.. waiting to see Benson.. as the crazy nurse was like "ONE PERSON AT A TIME PLEASE.. NOT TOO MANY AT ONCE" we were like what? Haiz.. never mind then... we waited long.... Benson had to have stitches on his face & a bandage around Benson's fractured arm. Soon after he came out...we prayed for Benson & Amy sent Benson home. Well.. the different groups of us.. we went our separate ways. I wanted to go out walk walk with certain people... but felt that I might be extra.. & I could not do much since I left my cash at home. I decided to go home halfway. BUT... I fell down halfway & it was like few cuts on my right leg & swelling on my left hand. The rest saw me & came over. I took 2 plasters from Cas.. thanks girl... :)... alrights.. after that I walked back to Outram Park MRT station & went home.. now HERE I AM!

      Clay Aiken - The Way  There's something bout the way you look tonight,  There's something bout the way that I can't take my eyes off you.  There's something bout the way your lips invite,  maybe it's the way that i get nervous when your around.  And I want you to be mine and if u need a reason why,   It's in the way that you move me,  and the way that you tease me the way that I want you tonight,  it's in the way that you hold me,  and the way that you know me,  when I can't find the right words to say,  u feel it in the way, you feel it in the way.  There's something 'bout how you stay on my mind,  there's something 'bout the way that I whisper your name  when I'm asleep Oh no.  Maybe its the look you get in your eyes.  Oh baby its the way that makes me feel to see you smile.  And the reasons they may change but what i'm feeling stays the same.  It's in the way that you move me,  and the way that you tease me the way that I want you tonight,  it's in the way that you hold me,  and the way that you know me,  when I can't find the right words to say,  u feel it in the way, you feel it in the way.  I can't put my fingers on just what it is  that makes me love you, you baby.  So don't ask me to describe,  I get all choked up inside,  just thinking 'bout the way.  It's in the way that you move me,  and the way that you tease me the way that I want you tonight,  it's in the way that you hold me,  and the way that you know me,  when I can't find the right words to say,  you feel it in the way, you feel it in the way.
