                              Suraiya died today. For those of you ignorant s.o.b.s who do not know her,Suraiya was an actress cum singer in Pre and pOst independence India. She started singing in the early 1940s and in the period 1948-49 was at her best, with her trio of great hits Badi Bahen, Dillagi and Pyaar Ki jeet, getting Rs. 50.000 per film in those days! She also had an affair with Dev Anand during this time. Her woes started after 1950, at whicxh point Lata Mangeshkar had come onstage. Along with her breakup with Dev, since her nani (THE BITCH!!) wanted her to marry a Muslim, her professional career started floundering, and even a Mirza Ghalib (1954) could nt salvage it. She retired after Rustom Sohrab in 1963, which had Vrinda's favourite "Yeh Kaisi Ajab Dastaan Ho Gayi Hai" and lived a secluded life until today.

      Hello to all I'd planned to write about the CBSE Heritage India Quiz, but to write about all of it would be an extremely painful task and I dont quite feel up to it, So I'll just tell all of you about my experience with the Clinic Nurse, and assorted hors d'ouevres about what happened today See, our school has this woman in the Clinic who is, to put a charitably, a bitch. We needed some white cloth to put on top of the tables and PP (Prema Pandey ma'am, to those of you not knowing her) asked me to get some from the clinic. So far so good. So I go to clinic, and ask for 4 sheets, only to be told "Main do sheets se zyaada nahi de sakti hoon". Me and Vrinda Maheshwari (not to be confused with Vrinda Marwah, who chews iron nails and turns into a werewolf at nightfall) beg and pleaded, but to no avail. So we went to Subedarji in iskool and asked  him and he allowed us to get two more sheets from the clinic, though not before getting evil look from the daughter (mother, she seemed) of death sitting there. So we go back to AVH, and PP sees a hideously crumpled sheet and throws a fit and tells us to get it changed IMMEDIATELY, because on no account would Mrs. C. stand for it. Now I am the one chosen for this task, and when PP says something yours is not to reason why, yours is but to do and meet the Clinic Incharge, which is a fate much worse than death. I go down again, shaking in my shoes and tell THE BITCH!!! "Ma'am, Chona Ma'am ko yeh achha nahi lag raha hai, woh keh rahein hai ke crumpled hai" Evil Bitch looks at me as though I'd indecently propositioned her, and goes "Unko kaho apne ghar se le aaye" Now I would have loved this comment from some other person, but the woman from hell was seriously annoying the Fuck out of me, and I was scared lest I tell her what a bitch she really is,  so I decided to shut up and look pleadingly at her until she gave way. After 10 minutes, she did. Then we also had to wrestle with big board, but since I cannot talk about that without weeping copiously, I shall not talk about it. The Quiz went off well, and later we got Pakodas and Samosas and sandwiches and Barfi, so I can safely say that there is a god, and that he  loves me.  Nazneen was annoyed with me for having refused to help her with her psychology project, so I had to spend hours trying to manaofy her, but in which I did finally succeed. Yus! That was about all. Buh Bye then

      A few facts about certain people who'll be referred to about once every blog- 1- Nisheeth (NieShit) (As Gays Blood Fist)- Nisheeth had the supreme good fortune to sit with me last year, and now he is sitting with Karan Misra. Lord, how art the mighty fallen!. He is fat, prone to emitting trouser-tearing gusts of wind(No, I'm serious, this did happen.) and is given to eating Kheer with Ketchup. Why wait to puke when you can taste it aise hi? One of the weirdest people I have had the  good fortune to know. 2- Bhavya- (Da Deep One)- To one of my wondrous capabilities of perversion, The name "Da Deep One" suggests wondrous possibilities. Bhavya is perpetually happy bastard, which is rather a pain to those less fortunate-than-him. He is prone to sudden desires, specially for, ahem, Vrinda's balls, which he managed to lose in the library. Mr. Khanna also believes in having special mealtimes,solely devoted to petpooja, and   woe betide   anyone who calls him up from 1-2 and 8-9. 3- Prateek (PC)- Prateek, along with Bhavya, is one of the props of our Quijj team, and has almost as many accidents and sundry siyapas as me, not least being Hairy Sonali Bajaj (Parjaiji) and a recent knee-break.While things happen to me, he asks for them. Mr. Chadha is also notoriously mean, financially as well as nastily, though I must say that Prateek did give treat on Wednesday,and he is blessed with Debbie Aunty as a mother, who is one of the best cooks in the world. 4- Gyan- Gyan is still one of my better friends, which proves the truth of friendship being thicker than love. 5- Nazneen- Hai Nazneen. My inamorata for the better part of class XI, who thinks I am nice,kind, sweet and decent one moment and nasty, bad, wicked, horrible the other. Remarkable inconsistency, but nice girl. with lovely Vindalloo and Dhansaak made at house. Has promised to go out with me sometime. 6-Aadisht Khanna- Bhavya da vadda praa, who lives in Saada Patiala where he is presently studying Engineering (barf), and gorging on Pinnis (Drool). He has site (www.aadisht.net) where he has interesting blog. A must-read. 7-Dr. Mrs. Chona, our esteemed principal. Ma'am is Ma'am. Heil Ma'am!  Methinks that's about enough people to introduce to you. More shall come as time passes Buh Bye then

      Well Well Well, Look who's the new blogger?! Tis true, sires. I too have decided to jump on the bandwagon and start a blog of my own. After Aadisht, Bhavya and Nisheeth, now, it's my turn First, a few words about myself Manav Kapur (for such is my name) is an extremely smart, handsome and dashing young gentleman who has a gaggle of girls constantly around him. Known as 'The Brain" to all those who know him, he is constantly asked by his friends how he manages to be so hot, chaahming and intelligent at the same time.  Yeah right, Manav, you wish. In your dreams, hon  Now, the truth Manav Kapur (for such IS my name) is a boy whose looks have been charitably described as "Er...weird" by some and "Manav? ewablackk!" by sundry others(Most of whom includes my friends, for whom charity does not seem to be an essential virtue). A gaggle of girls has been with moi at times, but well, not, certainly for my looks, nor for my personality which falls short of being winning. Perversion, thy name is Manav. The 'the brain' bit? Well, history maybe. In all other matters, Iam referred to as "Da Lunatic", for obvious reasons, as you will find after you get to know me. So follow me, gentle reader, through a day-by-day view of the viscissitudes of my life.

       The conch shells have been blown, along with the bugles. We are at war.  On this day, the 29th of January 2004, it is declared that Of Life and Lurrrve... is at war with The Journal of the Bloodfist Klan. Oft have we borne stoically the Insults and Calumnies of the leader of the (snigger) Klan. No longer shall we submit to this. There is a time for fun, and a time for peace. A day may come when we submit to this, when we forsake our self-respect, and lose all our aatmasammaan, but it is not this. THIS DAY WE FIGHT!  Our will is set. The infidel leader of the Klan, who hath abused our tribe for long, shall be driven in the dust.   The Lord above knows we have never been the aggressors. Indeed, we have often extended the warm hand of friendship. No longer. No longer shall we allow our friendship to be mistaken for weakness. We may be peaceful, but we care about our honour. We shall assuage our dignity.  Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties and so bear ourselves that, should This Blog and its allies last for a thousand years, men will still say "THIS was their finest hour.  I call upon those who have courage, those who are honourable, and those who have Internet space support us. To the others-  "Tremble, tyrants and traitors  The shame of all good men"  Manav  PS - With profound apologies to Winston Churchill, Tolkien, La Marseillaise and indirectly,  Shakespeare

      I'm no longer depressed now. My chhala has disappeared. According to Nisheeth I am the most obnoxious person on the Planet. Well, obnoxious I may (may. mind you, and I think Dhruv Dahiya is worse) be, but Nisheeth takes the cake in noxiosity (Is that the word?). Known for his trouser-tearing farts in Class 9, as well as eating Kheer with tomato sauce (which might have been the reason for the farts!), year he seems to have become ickier still. Az Gays has proudly informed the world about the fact that "I have basically stopped bathing, having last done so on boxing day (26th). It is therefore advised that anyone living in or around the city of New Delhi invest in gas masks"  He has personally confessed to me that he did not have a bath for at least 20 day in the height of summer. What beats me is how his family live with it.  As Gays also brings a putrid-smelling tiffin to school. What could be more noxious and obnoxious than that?  And he calls ME Obnoxious. (demented laughter ensues)  Baah Manav

      Good Evening All. I have been asked why I have not enabled comments on my blog. See, all of those reading this blog have their own blogs, and also know me. As a result, if there's something that they want to ask, they can pick up taliphun and call. Furthermore, it is MY Blog. Mine. Mera. Le Mien. Got the message? Good.  PC and Bhavya are going to Kanpur on wednesday for a science thingie. Whatever one might say about Science(And Abhishek Raman, referred to on Bhavya's blog, has said quite a lot!) Its quizzes are stuffed with $$$. With PC and Bhavya winning more than a thousand in a (needless to say, Science) quiz. Best of luck to them.  What else should I tell thee, gentle reader? Exams come closer. Ek jaan aur laakh gham, ghut ke reh jaaye na ham... Oh, I 'm completely off Nazneen now, with no trace of the lurrrve that existed for her. Am hunting for someone else now. Bhavya suggested Copal, who is duffer genius, Though looks wise she is hottie, her habit of saying "paahdon" when she doesn't get something (which, frankly, happens quite often) annoys me.  Those who hath insulted this blog, May Your Jewels Wither into Cottonseeds! Cool line, na? Thank you, VP.  I go now, Mathematics beckons. Manav

      Bonjour mes amis! Today was selection for head boy, or Bada Aadmi, as Bhavya calls it. Was quite good for some, namely Prateek, who now is almost certain to become head boy, Raman, since he did not pee in his pants, which is the most one can expect from him, and Sud. I bunked my English period today, which is one of the first times I have ever bunked classes in  my life, However, I later realised that we had anyway been called for photos, which makes my bunking legitimate. (Unlike Abeer Guha, who is a bastard) Ha Ha Ha! Malika Pukhraj also died two weeks back, making this the third musical personality to depart from this world within a week.  This is one of my most disjointed entries, but I'm bored and tired. Manav

      Hello Darling Helo, Hum tum pe Marela Hai! Cheerio to all, today happens to be Temporary insanity day, because of which I am temporarily insane. For those who argue that that is how I am always, well, they can derive orgasmic pleasure by shoving gaajar-moolis up their arses. From what Karan informs me, I realise that that will also enable them to stimulate their G-spots. HOW Karan knows about the location of the Male G-Spot I have no idea. Please consult him for further details. We have our clas Picnic tommorow, and we have decided to go to Nehru Park, which makes me remember a similar picnic in Class 10. We shall. that day, be going with Aakriti Prasad's class, which heightens the sense of Deja-vu, since last time, it was the day before the picnic that I had proposed to her for the first time, no prizes for guessing her answer, which neccessitated a second, third and fourth (albeit half-willed) proposal, each with the same result. Oh, I have been meaning to write about a certain incident that took place last week. I was chatting with Nisheeth online, while reading assorted blogs, when I opened Karan's (blog, you perverse people) and saw a rather explicit photo of Janet Jackson's mammary glands. In one of the most SLAGIATT (Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time) actions I have ever performed, I decided to send this to Nisheeth, using the Send files thingie on MSN. So far so good. However, I had not considered the possibility that Nisheeth's Mataji and Pitaji might be in the room, which they were. This led to the following chain of events. 1- Nisheeth opens the Successfully recieved file, and with horror gazes at Janet's titties with his mummiji right behing him. 2- Mataji leaves room to tell Pitaji, who happened to be out of the room at that point of time. 3- Nisheeth is summoned to Pitaji's room. 4- Pitaji gives Nisheeth - a)- A discourse on the birds and bees, which is rather surprising, since Nisheeth is almost 17, and one supposes his parents would have given it to him earlier. 2- A lecture on the Importance (Impotence, in Sumanspeak) of a good Moral Character. And last, but not the least. 3- A discourse of judging people before choosing friends, which I think is rather unfair, since  Aunty and Uncle have no idea of what I am, and hpw My Moral Character is. However, I have a sneaky suspicion that my Moral Character will not find favour with them, since even the most charitable of persons cannot describe the aforementioned Moral Character being quite Pristine. As a result of all that happened, I seem to have been declared persona non-grata at the Sharma residence, and can not call him up without the blush of shame upon the mantle of my cheek. Wail! In yet another example of SLAGIATT, I poked a board-pin up Karan Misra's rear end, for no other reason that the fact that such had been my wont at that time. Needless to say, the funny side of the matter was not what appealed to him, and methinks it did not quite stimulate his G-Spot, which has previously been mentioned. HA HA HA! Moving on, tomorrow happens to be the day that the head boy is chosen for school. As a result, I wish PC, Bhavya, Karan, Sud, and Zafar luck. (Zafar, poor guy, needs the most). May the best man win!. My prediction is that PC will Pakka be one head-boy, the other I cannot say. My English teacher is displeased with me for not having submitted my English Homework since November, a fact that has however not influenced her Monday test marking, where I have got a cool 32/40. Yay!. However, she has telephoned saadi mataji, who is now mazorly pissed with me. Swaah.  Oh, by the way, Aadisht's W-Fillet is on www.madhoo.com, where votes are needed for his entry to win. All of you, therefore, shall go to www.madhoo.com and vote for him every day. Thanking You Yours Sincerely Manav

      Today I shall give you a character sketch of my teachers- 1- Padmavathy Shrinivasan- Padma teaches us History, and has gone from being nice maternal teacher to Lalita Pawar in less than a week with our class. She's stopped giving us notes, and has become razzer intolerant with our class. Methinks she is overworked and needs rest and recuperation among those people who believe themselves to be Napoleon Bonaparte. 2- Rupa Das- Elle est Bangla, Need I say more? 3- Shashibala Aggarwal- Shashibala ma'am teaches us maths, and is a sweetie. She is a maths teacher cursed with XI-R, a class that patently does not want to learn mathematics. As a result, she has to contend with people doing Shamshad Begum imitations in her class, eating their tiffins, and bunking on a scale hitherto unknown to teachers. Yet  she only says one thing "Beta, this is not the way." I love her. 4- Atika Dayal- Atika Dayal teaches english. and is known by a large variety of nicknames which I shall not mention heyar. She does not quite ceyar for me, since I have not submitted my english homework for the past six months. Well, is theyar any point in doing it? She's planning to knock off 5 marks from my paper, and shall not speyar me, even though I have told her to read the merchant of Venice again, specially Portia's speech. "The quality of mercy is not strain'd, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest; It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:" I feyar that my English paper will not be the best I have ever given.  5- Last, but not the least. Mrs. Suman Lata. Email me for more information about Suman Ma'am!

      I must apologise for my long (and wholly warranted) absence. Darahsal, it was my cousins wedding yesterday due to which I was very busy. Since another cousin of mine has asked me to record this event for posterity, I shall do the honours today. The job of a historian is a very complex one, and that of a contemporar historian even more arduous. Keeping all this in mind, kindly excuse any factual errors. This is solely for Tinks. the rest can go faak themselves. The first of the ceremonies (The Shagan) happened on the 7th of February 2004, at the Panchsheel Club, New Delhi. The food there was quite remarkable, and I can assure you that I have never had such good vegetarian food in my life (This has a lot to do with the fact that I've hardly ever had vegetarian food anywhere, preffering Taamsik non-veg food.). Since nothing ever happens in a shagan, I shall not continue to waste time, effoirt and online space by blathering on On the 8th was the Ladies Sangeet. For all those who do not know what a ladies Sangeet in a Punjabi wedding is, its when a multitude of women (and in this case, a guy-moi) decide to sing a host of Punjabi Folk songs, mostly bitching about evil mother-in-laws, and relly senti ones about Vidaai, making up for a complete lack of singing talent with a great deal of gusto, accompanied with a dholki, and a chammach (spoon doesn't quite capture it!). The problem here was that no one quite knew how to bajaao the dholki apart from Maaji, who is 80-odd and could not sit down for long. As a result, we had to settle for a rather indifferent performance. According to everyone, I sung rather well, All the BJs (Buddhi Janaanis) and the not-so BJs were very impressed with my knowledge of Punju folk songs (all courtesy Surinder Kaur, and Ritika didi's wedding 8 years ago.) after which we had an antaakshari session, where I sang Shamshad Begum songs with my nasal pitch, making everyone put cotton inside ears. Well, in my defence, I enjoyed myself. The Mehndi and the shaadi shall be dealt with oin the next post. Manab PS- Saada chidiyaan da chamba ve, baabal asaan ud jaana

      I have been in semi-mourning for the last 3 days. As mentioned in my last blog, Suraiya died on the 31st of January 2004, at Kishendas Hospital in South Mumbai, at 9.25 AM of diabetes mellitus, low blood pressure and, to put the lid on things, a heart that decided to stop beating. Evidently. the only people from the film industry to come for her funeral were Dilip Kumar, who as far as I know dd not act with her in any film, and Dharmendra. who went to see her Dillagi 40 times from his Pind in Punjab. Dev Anand did not bother to go for her funeral, which shows major bastardpanti, since it was on account of him that she never got married. According to sundry stories about her on the net, it was after their break-up that her career started plumetting. I couldn't go for her funeral, and she's a Muslim, so there is no question of a chautha or an uthala, which I would certainly have attended.  Anyway, I have decided to resume my normal life, which basically means that it is not only Suraiya's songs I shall hear, but shall go back to my Shamshad Begum and Noorjehan. I am not feeling rather well today, sohave bunked the economics monday test. Buh Bye then

       It's not what you know, it's who you know that matters!   I'm very disappointed and sickened with the way the school functions.  Today was the  de facto   decision of who is what. The heads are as follows- 1- PC (Prateek)- No surprises here. With his marks in the boards, and hiis extensive extracurriculars, it was almost confirmed that he'll be headboy. I'm very pleased for him. Lord knows, he deserves it. 2- Vrinda Marwah- I have no idea whether she's head boy or head girl, all I know is that she's one of the heds. Vrinda is a female, or so her birth certificate says. With her lion(ess) looks, and deep manly voice, its hard to say. Anyway, we now move on to  3- Damini Bansal- Lord knows she's worked for this, and has managed to come out tops in a close competition between her, Sonali Punhani and Shefali Chadha. I'm happy for her too. Now is the 'surprise' This batch of class XII has Zafar Khursheed in school. Despite a less than stellar board record, and a not-quite-full extracurricular resume, he's become head boy. To be fair to him, he's a very nice guy, and doesn't ram his family down one's throat. As a student, he's sober, well-behaved and an overall decent boy. However, he's nothing exceptional.  As an appointment, I have no objection to him. His behaviour, as well as he fact that he's a good basketball player(I've not seen it, but he's captain, so it does count) should ensure he'd be an appointment. Preferably in the Sports section, or the students council. Hell. even the Post of Prezzzie, student council, chalta hai.  But head boy? I don't think so.  Everyone is very upsetwith him, and with Chona ma'am, I m, oddly enough, feeling sorry for him, He tries his hardest to act like a normal student, and its scarcely his fault that he knows ma'am in a non-official capacity,  Unfortunately, he's become one. And that is going to deeply affect the credibility of the school, as well as of some other people. Though, like every instituition, the school has already had a lot of politics, its never been so unsubtle as this.  Khair, que sera sera...

        Manny Low Manny Low Manny Low   Don't read this if you want humour, its not azgezesque. class XI is over. We're going to 12th. I m freaked. See, its not that I m scared about the fact that its a board year, though that doesn't quite cheer me up anyways. What I'm getting freaked out is the fact that its the last year in school. Its fucking freaky. Hello, I'm a kid still, Don't make me leave school!  I've always had trouble adjusting to new situations. In Infant, I used to howl when we had to go to school. In Vasant Vihar I was fine, largely because mama was there, I was then (and still am, when I m nervous) a mamma's boy. There's nothing like mama for making everything seem better.  In RKP, I hated it, It was largely because I didn't have many friends inita\ially, and I was also a horrible person, After I got friends by the end of VIIth, life improved and by class VIII I actually started enjoying life.  Lekin 10th, 10th was a turning point in my scholastic life. Finally I found a great set of friends, people who I'm very thankful to. My quizzing career, that Se Evil Udita had put into cold storage again kick-started after the Columban and Bongo (Siddharth Banerjee to all those who don't know him). Bongo took us under his wing, and, against Prema Ma'am's advice, took us for a quiz meant exclusively for class XI and XII, in which we managed to come 2nd. That was the actual start of Quizzing in RKP. We (PC, Bhavya, Anurag and Manav, in that order) went from strength to strength in this year, managing to always come either 2nd or 3rd, something that has managed to dog us until this year.  The pre-boards went very well, and gave me confidence for the boards, in which I was;t bad. By the end of 10th, everything was at its peak.  Since then, its not been as good, though its still been close.  I haven't had as much fun in Class in class XI as I managed in Class X, caused in part due to my moronic class in the dungeon block, in which everyone(with the exception of 5 people) have an IQ of x, where x is numerically so small that x square and higher powers cannot be considered. As a result of all these, I ve been bored in class. Very Bored.  On the Quiz and Personal front however, its been getting better. If you read Bhavya's blog, you get some idea of their quizzing success, in most of which I've also played a part, albeit a small one. Personally, I ve made great friends while keeping track of my old (and best) ones. My circle of friends is at its peak.  Now 12th. End of school. I m petrified. Let nothing change. Let ze bonds never grow weaker. Life's been the best I've had for the last two years, specially in school, Please, life, stay that way.  I have no doubt this'll seem very corny to all of you, me too by the morning. But right now, at 12.47 am. I say thanks. Thank you god, for all that I have. Thank you life, for all that you have given me. At this point, this minute, this juncture in life, I honestly feel I have no regrets. I know that I will have remembered some by the morning, that by the morning I'll revert to my pessimistic, low, boring self. I know that I may be low again, I know that I've screwed up my papers, but I have no regrets, none whatsoever, in these past two years.  May this be the case with me the day I die too. (No, I am not suicidal!, I m rambling, I know. Don't read this if you want humour, it doesn't have much). I once read something about an old woman whose family prepared a wonderful dinner for her, and after that she went for a walk and never came back. She was blessed. How lovely it would be to die when one is at peace with oneself, when one can honestly say "Thank you God, for all you have given to me".  Hai Ram, what all have I been writing! Yours Puzzledly Manav (not so low now)

I have been very remiss in writing blog entries, and not writing one for two weeks cannot be excused.  Today you shall hear about the tragedy of my papers.  History- 10th March 2004 - This was the first paper, and the one in which my panic attacks started. Though we hardly had much course, I was so freaked out that my productivity declined to approximately 20% of what it normally is. The paper did not, however, go badly and with a bit of luck I expect something like an 80 in it, which is extremely good for history.  2- Geography- 12th March 2004 - I am stupid, I left two whole chapters in this. Another effect of panic. In case someone has any tips on panic management, please give them to me, I ve managed to majorly screw up my papers this time, However, it could have been a lot worse. Am expecting about 80 in this too.  3- English- 13th March 2004 - What does one say about English? As apapers go, it wasn't bad, with the notemaing, the only thing I hate being easy, 75-80.  40 Maths-15th March 2004 - Now this was FUCKED! FAAKED MAJORLY. I don't know what happened but I forgot everything I had done in half my chapoters, and I'll be lucky if I manage a 60.  4th- Economics-17th March 2004 - The only redeeming feature of this was the fact that the Indian eco part was easy, sine I fucked up stats. Useless set of papers

      Hello there, I hope all of you are in the pink of health, because I am not. Examinations draw closer, and I must agree with As Gays Blood Fist, even though I am not in Pay Puh Mode. I admire him for that (Is there no end to my magnanimity?)  As Gays Blood Fist has recently published a blog entry. I shall quote from it.. 1- Da Lunatic then proceeded to call her a Brontosaurus, which one also finds funny, when one considers the fact that both Da Lunatic and most Brontosauruses have comparable brain sizes. A brontosaurus had a brain of 5.8kgs, so thanks, Nisheeth. It is not, incidentally the size that makes a difference to the intellect (which I have quite a lot of), but the ridges on it. Also, the plural of brontosaurus (Apatosaurus excelsus) happens to be brontosauri. 2- However, if you are male, and screw yourself (a male) it is supposed to be okay. What crap! Please nobody give me that time honored cockroach excreta about how screwing yourself and fagging are two different things,they're not.  Ermm, I didn't know that masturbation involved "Screwing" as per the definitiion of the word. Correct me if this is so. As far as I know, fagging refers to smoking cigarettes, which is definitely  not  the same as screwing oneself. What I think Azgez is referring to, is shagging. Bye-bye Manav

      As Gays Blood Fist has decided not to fight, and has slunk home, tale between legs. Yus! Victory is ours.  Az Gays also has the audacity to say that those who talk abput Jerking Off are a dirty lot. Methinks he's demented, and frustrated. Haath ne bhi saath nahi diya.... Cheerio Manav  PS- Karan, cheerio is a word in the English Language and thus cannot be copyrighted, unless it is a product, at which point it will be Cheerio (TM).

      My Blood Boils With Indignation!  My Family is a Hindu Rabid Group of Individuals who does not care a fig for the Secular Culture of India!!!!!!!!  Okay, For those of you who cannot still understand, My Family Is Voting For The BJP!!!!!!!!!! Oh Horrors. The shame of it. The family of the greatest fan of Indira Gandhi voting for the BJP. My mother actually had the supreme audacity of saying that the Congress was responsible for India's woes.  I live in a family full of philistines and wannabe Praveen Togadias. God, do not forsake me!!!

      Hello Me Hearties! The heat is getting to me, as is the fact that no one ever seems to be online. The reason for this is primarily that Bhavya and Karan, who used to be online almost perpetually, can no longer come online (For reasons why, go to their respective blogs.) Well, anyway, what use is the telephone? Not much, in fact, because the phone in my room is a temperamental, menopausal BITCH that sometimes decides to work, and sometimes doesn't. When it does work, it makes me hear people's voices at a volume of .000000000000000001 decibels, and occasionally decides to cut the call of its own accord. All my pleas to get a new instrument have fallen on deaf ears and stony hearts. Everyone else is studying hard, which is damn good for them because they will end up getting a 99% in their boards and a ticket to FIIT-JEE and whatnot, but it doesn't do a lot of good for my morale. I m only doing 3 hours of work everyday, not counting the SAT! And I m not invited to parties where I can get drunk too!!!!1 Sniff

       SONIA GANDHI IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND REPREHENSIBLE   I cannot believe the woman says she does not want to be Prime Minister. I mean, woman, you were the Prime Ministerial Candidate. Hell, you joined Politics to prevent the Grand Old Party's death. How then do you justify backing away. just went the party was to come in power?  Mrs. Gandhi, the country, barring a few so-called intellectuals in urban areas support you. The Muslim vote was totally for the congress. They know of your 'foreign origin', and it doesn't make any difference to them. What are you trying to prove by going on about How ManMohan Singh will be a good PM? If the party had Manmohan Singh as its wannabe PM, the INC Would have reached double digits?  Are you scared? If you are, I am disgusted. You didn't join politics to back out. Why don't you bother to learn from your Mother-in-Law, of whom you are but a grotesque replica? It matter to HER that her security guards, who ended up shooting her, were Sikhs. Remember her speech the night before her death at Bhubhaneshwar. Your MIL was promoted only because she was a 'goongi gudiya', and how wrong she proved her detractors.  Woman, show some courage and have the decency to take what you publically proclaimed you needed!  W

      Summer hols begin. Life is occasionally Not a  .  I ve had great fun since Friday. On Friday, a huge gang of us went to PVR Saket to watch Passion Of the Christ, which, by the way, is a lovely movie, although Very Gory in parts, The squeamish, please watch out. Copal and Rohit were howling in the end and I don't know whether I blame them. If it wasn't for Jit and his terrible jokes, I'd have been howling too.  Yesterday was a vela day, whence I did nothing but sleep and read. I finished a very nice book called Those Days, By Suniel Gangopadhyay. Anyone interested in of the 19tth century, its a must-read. For dinner, we went out with a group of friends and managed to have fun, nor a mean achievement when the people called HATE each other like poison, and can barely be civil to one another. As Bhavya says:Ah Well, such is life.  Yoday I went for another movie, with Prateek and Zafar, the two head boys of our school. It was a LOT more fun that I'd expected, and we had more fun at Barista. Methinks 12th will be as good as 10th. Hellboy is (to my non-action oriented) mind a passable movie that became fun only because of the company.   I am annoyed with little girls who are treated by MAH MONEY !!! and then do not write poems for me. (Damini, Please Note!!!).    Now we have relatives over, a veritable baaraat of them.   Jab Bhagwaan deta hai, to chhappad phaad ke deta hai! . I have pesky little brats over who are too young to be told to fuck off and are now trying to make me play Darkroom with them. I ve a good mind to make them choke on their (Their!!!!!! I bought them!!!!!!!!) Shaami Kababs. Can anyone tell me why little kids are so cute upto the time they turn two, and why they become so wholly obnoxious after that? More people have walked in, so I must go to give them inane smiles and listen to how tall I've grown, and how much weight I've lost. Why, also, is conversation in Punjabi Family Reunions so standardised? I'll have to go, smile, and generally act as though they've made my day by coming, which they have not. Not By a Long Shot.   Khair, they might go soon! I  Manav (With fingers crossed!!!!)

       On Lunches, and Birthdays  Yesterday, we went for lunch. Lunch at an Italian Restaurant, flavors! (The Italian Restaurant, so people say!) Aadisht treat God Bless Aadisht! May he sire a hundred sons!!! The food was out of the world, as was the company. (We do not count Vidushi in the first half, who moped because her cellphone could not be switched on.). Despite the fact that the seating arrangements had to be changed many times,to enable Damini and Vidz to kick people, we had joy, we had Phun. And now, we have seasons in the sun! The Mercury is touching 43 c already. and is climbing still further. Unlike the Khanna Bros. I do not like the heat, It pisses me off, and makes me grumpy. Khair, we live in troubled times.  Today is Badau Birthday in the family, with two of Dadaji's brothers being born on this day, one in 1917, and the other in 1929. Supposedly, it was also Beeji's birthday (Dadajis mother), and I m getting a bit nostalgic thinking about her. Hence, I shall stop right here.

      Karan's emergency is working, inasmuch as I am back to writing!. Our sweet esteemed Principal Dr. Shyama Chona has ensured that all hapless appointments have to do duty everyday in break. The Quiz Club has been given the BRIDGE, of all things, ie,That pathetic uncovered corridor connecting all the Bacha Blocks where nothing ever happens! That's not quite true, since in our times a condom was found there, and someone's head was bashed in with a jhaadu. Since then things have considerably quitened down, and the installation of gorgons like Amla Thukral and Swarn Sardana has put an end to whatever little mischief that happened. My duties basically consist of going with Anurag Sud (He of the sharklike smile), walking with him, telling kids not to run, and picking up and throwing an empty coke bottle in the bin. Hardly scintillating.  The Hitch-hikers Guide to the Galaxy is a fabulous book, and all those bits of human flotsam and jetsam who haven't read it should do so at the earliest. I love Douglas Adams. Pity he died so soon.  Aadisht has got into IIM Bangalore, where hopefully he will go bang-a-whore. Vadhaiyaan!!!!. What's even better is the fact that he's taking all of us out to lunch at Flavors! Bhavya, when you get into IIM-Ahmedabad, we want either Dakshin or Pan-Asian!  Our school seems to be moving toward Fascism, with esteemed principal Dr. Mrs. Shyama Chona, Padmashri awardee, being the Dipsian equivalent of Mussollini. While he had his Black Shirts, she has her Red Sashes. Vrinda, Damini and Prateek, along with Zafar the duffer, are all on their way to becoming obedient brainwashed slaves of her Excellency. God, why dost thou sleep when thy obedient servants suffer? Is Madam Chona the next Goldy Malhotra? Will DPS Become as decrepit a school as Modern School Vasant  Vihar? Will I flunk my eco monday tests.   In sab ke jawaab ke liye, Waach This Ispace!    Well, I think I'll be a bit more regular now, filhaal, this is  it.

      Okay. Important work first! First of all, a hearti\y (and long overdue!) Happy Birthday to Nisheeth, who splits his pants with farts! Enjoy this year, may you have great fun. We went for his birthday to watch the Day after Tommorow, a very weird and implausible movie. We also saw the promos for another movie, which I shall not name, for fear of offending your delicate sensitivities. but which me and PC have planned to watch. Next, and as important. A happy and joyous birthday to Vrinda Maheshwari. May she never have to feast upon Papayas! Her birthday celebrations will be held on the coming monday, so you shall be told about them then. Congratulations on her SAT score of 1600 are also due, and are forthcoming. PC's got a 1550 in HIS SAT. Here's looking at you. kid! I have been blessed with a lowly 1400. so you will excuse me for not commenting more about it. PC,Vrinda, Karan, Gyan. Ankush, Please accept my heartiest. though somewhat subdued congratulations.  My Verbal has severely disappointed me again. Will someone please give me tuitions in English?  Moving on to pleasanter topics, today I had a very enjoyable lunch at Anant Dang's place, with Nazneen and Puja Sen for company, where I watched the godfather, and ate wonderful pizza and  spaghetti with meatballs made by Anuradha ma'am, his mother. The movie was one of the best I have ever seen. and I would appreciate someone lending the book to me. The weather in Delhi now sucks, and books are appreciated!  Bhavya has gone to Kerala, a hellhole of the highest order, which has temperatures in the early 30s throughout the year. Though its food, I must admit, is good, the spices make for not-quite-enjoyable mornings-after, and is more suitable for a cool climate. Beaches and backwaters don't appeal to me. Give me hills anytime. Or Calcutta!  The whole world seems to hate Calcutta, on account of it being filthy, and decaying. While the accusations are quite wellfounded, I'd like to know which city in India is not filthy. Decaying it may be, but it has wonderful food, specially Maachher Jhol, and Ilish Paabda. Say whatever about the Bengali, their food is wonderful.  Its also an extremely historical city, specially to one who is obsessed with the Rah, and reflects the grandeur of the Raj quite adequately. Call me an ass, I much prefer Chowringhee or Park Street or the Victoria Memorial to any of the buildings in Lutyen's Delhi, which always seems to be an anachroism. A hodgepodge of Indo-Saracenic-Gothic architecture. A city that is so out-of-touch with the rest of Delhi that it seems a deliberate affront to India. New Delhi has been betrayed by the rest of the city, which is a mess in comparison. People who talk about planning and good roads should see Connaught Place (Or whatever its called in Politicalese) on sunday Rush-hour.   Calcutta also has cheap food! Who in New Delhi could dream of eating Kathi rolls for Rs. 16? Or authentic Hakka chinese for Rs. 890. with 16 people eating? The second-hand books one gets are amazing, and are sold for something like 6-25 Rs., a throwaway. Try buying books this cheap anywhere in Delhi.   The trams are another lovely feature of the city. A non-polluting, and rapid (for calcutta, rapid!) means of transport which has unfortunately been starved of cash. For those who wish to go at more than 19 kmph, Calcutta also has the metro of sorts, supposedly fully dug by hand, which is rather bad, as compared to those of the world, and Delhi.  A NON Commie, non Momotadi government, run with men like E. Shreedharan. could make Calcutta into a wonderful place to live in within 3 years. The trouble is that Bengalis seem to lack all initiative.

       Compte à rebours pour le Columban  Le 'Columban open' ; est d'après les informations reçues le jeu le plus dur en Inde du nord. A traditionnellement tenu chaque année, en août, à l'ecole de St. Columba's, Delhi, avec le quizmaster qui est un Anglo-Indien, M. Francis Grosser.  Notre école, le DPS R.K.Puram a participé à ce jeu depuis le temps immémorial et est uniformément venue d'abord ou deuxième du temps. En 2002, l'équipe d'école, menée par Bongo, qui était le président du 'quiz Club' ; soyez venu d'abord en cela, et l'année dernière nous sommes venus en deuxieme lieu.  C'est notre année dernière à l'école, qui le rend neccessary pour que nous gagnent la chose damnée cette année. Pas Deuxième Position. Victoire. V-I-C-T-O-I-R-E !. À cet effet, les efforts ont déjà commencé. J'ai dévoré les 10 premiers jeux du Mastermind India, ecrit par M. Siddharth Basu, dont la famille Bhavya adore.  Espérer gagner Manav Cette article est en francais pour une professeur de notre ecole, une Mme. Dasgupta.

      I m making an effort to write now. I shall write about Shamshad Begum.  Very few people born after 1980 even know who she is, which is very sad considering she earnt a cool Rs. 1000 per song as early as 1946, and was one of the first singers to be given the epithet of 'legend' in their lifetime,. Even Saigal, whose voice seems to hold some peculiar fascination for all the buddhhas, was honoured with this title (for wholly unexplained reasons!) after he died.  Shamshad Begum has sung all kinds of songs- from the weepy, as epitomised by her 'Hum Dard Ka Afsaana, duniya ko suna denge' (Dard, 1947), to her 'Chhod Baabul Ka Ghar', a lovely song from Babul, 1950, to the romantic (Meri Neendon mein tum, mere khwaabon mein tum, Naya Andaz, 1956). But what nobody has talked about is her silly songs, which truly are a treat, if only for their immense stupidity. She was the female forerunner, and later equivalent to Kishore Kumar. Consider some of her songs. I m quoting her SHAMSHAD: Humse nain milaana, BA pass Kar ke           Humse preet lagaana BA pass kar ke           Jee BA pass karke, ho BA paas kar ke       BA pass Karke, mohe digri dikhaavo, ji mohe digri dikhaave Male: Yeh hai BA ki digri, gori gusse me na aavo Shamshad: Apni yeh char sau bees, kisi aur pe chalaavo Jaao Yeh hai jhooti digei, isko Koode mein phenk aavo  Has anyone heard stupider songs, which manage to be quite so humourously silly without being cheap? And thats not all, she also has a "Yeh duniya roop ki chor" in which she sings lines in Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, Tamil, Gujarati and Marathi, in different styles. It may be funny, but singing that one song, in the pitch she managed, is not at all an easy thing to do. I know, because I've tried copying the pitch many times. Even for a female, it'd be very tough. 'Mere Piya Gaye Rangoon', which is now such a majorly cliched song that its sung everywhere old singers are being parodied, is also one of hers.  And before the advent of Lata Mangeshkar, she had no competition. Geeta Dutt couldn't manage the nasal singing well, and nasal singing was all that was desired then. Even after Lata, she, along with Geeta Dutt, was one of the only singers to survive the Mangeshkar onslaught well into the 1960s.   Sung two years after she officially retired, Kajra Muhobbatwala (Kismat, 1968) still remains evergreen, as do most of her songs. How many other singers of the 40s have had their songs remixed (and utterly ruined, too, but thats quite another matter) by slutty ultra-modern teenyboppers? For those of you who don't know, Saiyan dil mein aana re was a nice, peppy Shamshad number before those whores ruined it.  This article has been written after I discovered that Shamshad is not, as I originally supposed, dead, but alive and comfortably ensconsed at a suburban flat in Mumbai. Anyone who knoews more about her, please tell me.
