       Today my mom and I finished the office! Yay! The fair around here started so I get to see all of the ponies and bunnies! That's basically the only reason for me to go because there isn't much to go on there and the tickets are expensive! But I am getting stuck going with my parents this year! Last year I went with...A few friends and met some there. I never got to see the bunnies and stuff! But I did go on the rides! Well later~*~Lyndsey~*~

        Dad and I went fishing! He caught a 26&nbsp;inches Northern! We let it go because I wanted to!! It was hooked really badly so it took a while to get him off and back in the water! It was bleeding and when we put it back it wasn't moving, so my dad pulled it back and forth in the water! Five minutes later it came to the top of the lake and sat there for a few seconds then went down! We looked around the lake for about twenty minutes to see if it would live! We didn't see it come up! I hope it lived! Yes, all of this over a fishy!  I had a really weird dream last night! Just down the street from us is a vet, But in my dream it was a shelter and stuff like the ASPCA or whatever its called! In the dream there was a horse that just shoed up and once my dad found out, he wouldn't let me go over there because of it! Then In our house there was like a pile of snow in the corner of the kitchen, but it was outside! (one of the messed up dreams) I said I was going to go over to the shelter after I stood up from sitting in the snow! My dad said I had no busness going over there! So I left the house and was crossing the street and started to head over there when my mom came over and stopped me. I ran off and started to head to my fried Sarah's house! But in the dream there was like a campground I had to run threw! My mom somehow was able to keep up with me when I ran! Like&nbsp;I said the messed up dream! When I got to my friend Sarah's house I ran into a grayish&nbsp; colored stall in the bathroom! It was just two stalls in a room!&nbsp; A large one , for the handicap and a smaller one! There were a few of my friends in it! I ran into the larger one and one of my friends were in it! I don't know who it was but in the dream I knew we were friends! My mom came over and tried to get into the stall! I think I was like drunk or something while she was trying to get in because I was laughing really loud and almost falling forward!Then we left and I guess we were going somewhere like camping or something! But that's all&nbsp;I remember! It was really gay! The horse in the dream was really small like a fat plastic or stuffed one! It was said to be thrown on the curb and not fed! It was only one month old! I think in the middle of looking at it, it actually changed into&nbsp; a stuffed animal! But when it came in it was in the palms of the person's hands and was blinking and stuff! It was really cute! I'm sorry for writing all of that!  I didn't really do anything else! My mom made me go with down the street in the car to get groceries(milk) it was really pointless! Well see ya!

        Today wasnt any different then the others, But one thing, Nick didn't burn any corndogs! When my mom woke up this morning or yesterday (its 1:09) She started to get worried becuase she smelt smoke! It was funny! Today my cousin and two of her children came over! John jr and Taylor, girl and boy!(She has another one, Tawnie) I think she might have one more but I'm not sure! At about ten my family and I went to go look for the north lights because we were suposed to see them here! We didn't! Tomarrow is another good night to look, or so says the weather man! Well I don't have anything else to type so I will be back later!

       My brother Nick tried to make corndogs and the hole room filled with smoke!! It was really funny! The smoke detectors didn't even go off! It smelt really bad! The saddest thing was that he put them in the microwave...and only for three minunits. It was on high! It was funny! We put fans in the windows! Well im going to go byes!

       Today I have been cleaning! My dad made a deal with my brother and I, It was if we would work really hard to clean the hole house (and I mean hole house) he would pay us $100 a week! Not a bad deal. But he figures it will take two to three weeks! I didn't post last night again because I was busy watching Inuyasha and playing FF8! My brother got me involved in anime and video games! Inuyasha seems kind of stupid if you just try to jump in at points but it is a&nbsp;really good anime! I think anyway! I haven't seen it all the way threw yet but I've seen some of the beginning like at least the first five, then skip like ten and that's about where I am. I've seen a few down further but not by much! Its on channel 52 (adult swim) at 11:30c Mondays to Thursdays. For ones that are closer to the end its on 52 at 11:00...Or is it 11:30..On Saturdays! I so hope Inuyasha and kagome end up together at the end! I hope he decides to become full human...If none of you know what the heck I am talking about then too bad for you! I know I'm a dork for liking this stuff but I don't care anymore!&nbsp;Oh yeah, Over the summer I decided not to eat meat! I have wanted to&nbsp; for a long time but my parents actual told me&nbsp;I couldn't become a vegetarian! But they have decided to allow me! If any of you are tired of listening to me I'm sure&nbsp; I will write more interesting things another day! But I'm sorry, it wont be today! Well I'm going to get going! (I don't even think anyone is and or will read my blog!)

         Hey everyone, Sorry it has been so long. Ive just been really busy. I just got a letter about me being invited to go to paris, rome and all of that for school! My parents laughed and threw it away. I just got a 10 gallong tank for my fish in my room. Its really cool! I like my friend Sarah's more. But thats cool. My mom baught me somethign that is in her tank because I told her what Sarah's looked like and told her I like it. I hope outs is atleast a diferant color. Not much I can do if it isnt. I just got three fish so far! They are suposed to be schooling fish but I dont think they are. They are some type of zebra fish. But If you look really close you can tell that they have blue stripes not black. They are kind of weird looking.    I just not to long ago cut my hair. It was soo messed up! I tryed to fix it, no, its not worse. It is better but still looks bad. Its grown out sence then. I colored it also. It was the color I had it before. It is Golden Blonde. Afterwords I highlited it. It kindof turned out bad. But Im living with It! Well I will type later. Bye.
