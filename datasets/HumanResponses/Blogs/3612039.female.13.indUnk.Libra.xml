      Wow,  last day of school!  I had two exams...which I am positive I passed! Muhahaha!   This morning  was horrible! I had to help nick, my brother with all his stuff in getting ready for school like doing his hair in liberty spikes, and deing it, ugh! But yeah, because I was forcied to help him, I did not get a chance to  a.- eat breakfast, which totally freeked my mother out...I was/am fine with it... b.- find the campera, I had to steel one of BJayz, which was more like begging until she gave it to me, but thats ok! and  c.- i didnt have time to put on...MAKEUP! ARGH, i was totally ready to kill everyone, but it did end up being an ok really good day.   my first exam  *health* was totally stupid and asked questions like ~Who is the inventer of basketball~...like I want/need to know that! but anyway, after that I got to beade a lot of people's hair, including adam's, though he will deny it now.   Than at break , Kyle again was stuffing chocolate down my shirt, but oh well...and Jeff dumped candice cause Adrienne was mad at him! A little confusing no? Also, I got to find out the lewis love circle! he likes S.C. who likes B.H. and Holly fuller knows the details! I really wanna get them together!!!  second exam  was Geometry, which was totally easy, i got a B! Thats good, cause i realy got test trouble! But yeah, I got to sign PG's year book, and Im glad, cause no-one else had signed it! But than Mrs. Shores got totally ticked at me, and all I did was tell Gillz to turn the CD player down...it was after the tests were turned in to! Oh well, never have to see the meanie agian! Oh, that sounds good!   After the bell rang  I walked with Gillz back to C lockers, and walked out to the buses with Kyle, but Rosa kinda sorta reuned a moment...oh well, i will kick her booty later! Yeah, than...NO MORE SCHOOL FOR 3 MONTHS!!! Im gonna miss everyone though...i talked to Meghan on the phone for 2 hours when I got home, i was already school sick! hahaha, yeah. Im pathetic! Oh well, bed time.     y'all...kyle some other time!

       Exams- Today was ok. I first had my English-Cona exam, which wasnt to bad, but I didnt read *Midsummer Nights Dream*, so I got about 20 of the questions wrong i think. Oh well. Than we had the science exam, which wasnt terriable, but it def wasnt easy. There was a bit of chemical equations on there that I had missed in class, but thats ok.  Lunch- Yeah, at luch, they *Kyle and Jeff* had a contest to see if they could get gummy bears down my shirt...yeah, it was intresting. I dont mind though, so it was no biggy. Also, I got Jeff to sign my year book...argh, hez sooo mean! He was like making funna me. Oh well!  Friends*Gillz*- Ok, I love her to death, but someone help! Gillz is crazy. I love her for it, but sometimes she doesnt know when to stop. She loves Jeff, but totally blows him off and makes funna him. She asked him out tonight, even though I warned her, and than she like blew up at him and was like all *you are loosing all of ur friends* and than she blew up at me cause I was on the phone talking to megz! She was like *go call him and talk about how much of a bitch I am, you've done it before*. OMG! I would never call her a bitch! Shez my bff for crist sake! I really dont know what to do anymore. My *safe* world seems to be falling apart. Its like a break down, but 10 times worse! I dont know...Ive got soo much going on, that I wish I could just drop it and like...i dunno. Sometimes I think that life would carry on so much better without me.

They were HARD! I never remember the places in France, to many wierd names, and civics, she told us not to study stuff on the exam! ARGH! SOOO MAD!  Friends- Jillz is worried about erin, who is litterally orobably killing herself at the moment and I cannot do anything to help. Gillz is worried about her dog, who is dieing. She also likes her friend Candice's *bf*, its in stars cause they do everything, but she wont give it the title. Adrienne is extremely mad at Jeff cause he is totally in love with Candice, and is being rude and ignoring her *to some extent* and all. Erica hates Robert, cause he almost broke her leg. She also hates Donnie, cause he wont fn leave her alone, but she is still totally in love with Gunnar. Meghan loves donnie, today they got inschool for the 3rd time in a week, cause they were making out. Yeah, and I am in control of all of this. hahaha, not!   Well about me , I havnt gotten any more e-mails from my freek stalker, so my parents are leaving me alone! YES! And I may be able to go to the movies with Kyle on Thursday, hope so!

School- I excell in Math, with the brains of my friend Gillz, and I totally love science, especially where I blow things up! I love singing, but I play the flute in band instead. And no, I am not a band geek, I have many friends whom I love deaily. Oh, and yeah, I cannot spell...at all!  Friends- I love my friends...troubled as they may be, they get me through everything. 1st off, theres Gillz. I dont Know how she stands me, sence we are totally able to read eachothers mind...or i can read hers anyway, but she has managed to forgive me everytime I have fallen in love with her man, or needed the homework to copy. I totally love her. Than there is Erica. Shez my dependent friend...meaning I depend on her. She is sooo light hearted, and she can brighten up a room. Than there is Jillz, Alma, B.J., Meg, and a few others. They are my dependent friends, meaning I am usually helping them. I love tham to death!  Boyz- Ok, yeah contrarary to common belief, I do not live off of boyz. I can totally live without them. I do, however have many guy friends, such as jeff*love him to death. Hez so totally a light and fluffy kinda guy* and John, although he hates me now, kinda cause I dumped him for kyle. Yes, lastly kyle. I love kyle. He is an awsome, open, curly haired, smart, athletic kinda guy. I dont think I let him know how much I love him enough.   Sports- I totally live off of Gymnastics, SOCCER, and cross country.
