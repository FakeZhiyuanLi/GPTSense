      Last night all the ladies of lovely linda street gathered for a dinner that included veggie soup, pita pizza, (free) bread and roasted garlic, and yummy vegan molasses-ginger cookies for dessert (and several bottles of wine). We all toasted to the final months of our household, brainstormed costume-concepts for the final linda st. fiesta, and hashed out some of our domestic issues. I think it ended with everyone feeling okay about our final months together, and the idea that we'd try to enjoy them instead of squabbling about dishes and toilet paper. Not to say that this living situation has been difficult, but we all have our moments, especially in a house of 5 women. Overall it has been an amazing experience for me, and every one of my roommates has taught me something. As much as I can't wait to live with Jeff, I am going to miss having such a powerful female environment around me (that's the new age Amber talking).

      Tuesdays are better than Mondays, but only slightly. I still feel like the weekend is far away, but at least I've taken the first step towards it in getting through yesterday. My Monday turned out being better than your average Monday. Despite feeling spent from my busy weekend, I managed to be a productive worker bee yesterday and get a lot done. I also did a pilates class at lunch and my sore abs are feeling its effects/benefits today. Last night I met my roommie for dinner at ChaChaCha, a place we tend to frequent quite often, and we ate our favorite platanos maduros and chicken quesadilla, washed down with a few pitchers of sangria (they were little pitchers, I swear), and had a long talk. We came to the realization that the platanos are almost better with whipped cream (thanks to the bartender's advice) than they are with black beans. Oh, and we also concluded that our issues are resolved and we're buddies again. Then we went home and did interpretive dance to Tori Amos music with our other roommates. Good times!   In running news, I have none to report, because I suck. I hope you all won't hate me when I totally flake on my commitment to run that half-marathon in August. I just don't see that happening.   Tonight.... Lovely Linda St. Roommate Dinner and maybe a movie. And Jeff leaves for Texas tomorrow :-(

      I'm at a loss for an inspired title right now as it is Monday again, and my weekend has steamrolled over me and left me exhausted, broke, and unprepared for another full week. Not one, not two, but three friends from out of town were visiting this weekend, Fahrenheit 911 opened and I schlepped all the way to Daly City to see it, pride revilers and their festivities took over the city and (at times) my neighborhood - birthdays were celebrated, much food and alcohol was consumed, and mostly fun was had (I say mostly b/c I did have some drama with a friend :-(). Now I am back at work, dealing with Monday's abrupt return to reality. Not that this week is totally without hope - there is a three day weekend to look forward to (will anyone else be around?) and I get to spend it with two of my favorite people - the chico and his dog Casey. To get myself through the week I have 3 new netflix on their way, a roommate dinner tomorrow night, drinks on Wed. with friends, and many yoga classes to attend throughout.   I should also be spreading the word that Fahrenheit 9-11 is amazing and very important for everyone to see. It was a moving film, and it lacked the typical Michael Moore obnoxiousness. Jeff has offered to buy you a ticket if you're feeling reluctant, so hit him up and go see it!

      I'm being really lazy today and laying around, nursing my sore neck and watching netflix. I didn't make it in to work today, and it seems that neither did two other chicas. Its just not a day for working - sorry to those of you out there slaving away at your desks.   I'm looking forward to the movie tonight - come back tomorrow for a review!

      The #15 Thai Chicken from Specialty's is sooo delish. And if you're there, their cookies aren't too shabby either. Seriously people, a chicken breast, avocado, cucumber, carrots, lettuce, and yummy thai sauce... too good! A little messy, but worth the extra napkin effort.  I've got mine at my desk right now and am LOVING it!  Oh and my neck is feeling better. I went to yoga again today (I know, maybe not the best idea, but I was careful) and my instructor told me how to prevent straining it any further.   And a shout out to my medicine chicas that got me through our run last night by being goofy and jumping over concrete benches along the embarcadero. I love you both.  And check out a website one of the chicas told me about www.about-face.org for a non-profit that seeks to change negative images of women in our culture.

      I'm feeling rather poo poo today b/c I did something stupid to my neck and its hurting. I can't turn my head to the right without sending pain down through my neck and back. I don't want to bore you with my whining... In other news, it looks like its going to be another busy weekend with a lot of visitors in town. Of course, I'm heading out to see Fahrenheit 911 on Friday night with the rest of the liberal masses. My question is; will this film be successful in affecting the upcoming election if only liberal sympathizers go see it? I really hope that its message also reaches those that haven't thought about these issues and not just in the form of a strong backlash. Someone recently told me how surprised a lot of people are to hear that none of the hijackers on 911 were Iraqi. I think a lot of people are under the misconception that they were. And its those types of ideas that the Bush administration has managed to inadvertently plant in American minds to justify their Iraq invasion. Stoopid Bush! Wait, will the FBI monitor my blog if I say things like that?

      I'm trying not to let the caca things about my day bring me down and focus on the positives, which have been so far:  - I did a headstand in yoga! - Good oatmeal, wheat germ, chocolate chip cookie at lunch - 3 new Netflix DVD's on their way - Cute picture of Casey (the dog) with the above quote on my dry-erase board - Daydreams about the potential cohabitatin' that seems to be happening in October - My wonderful friend returning to the bay area to work at Eccolo in Berkeley  Those are a lot of nice things to think about. I feel better already.

      It was such a nice (and super busy) weekend, did it have to end so quickly? Friday I made my super delish corn chowder for dinner and my roomie made yummy chicken veggie pizza and we watched "Spellbound" with the chico. Then we watched "50 First Dates" and I happily curled up with the chico, and slept through the entire movie. Saturday I did some great power shopping with "Charlotte" aka Reno. I scored an awesome pair of jeans at Crossroads and even got some $$ in trade for some old clothes of mine. Then we were party planners extraordinaire for our beautiful friend's b-day gathering that evening. The chicas proceeded to eat, drink, and be hysterically merry all around the mission area. Sunday was father's day and the chico and I headed up to Santa Rosa for a BBQ with the fam. Busy, busy weekend. But what I did not manage to do this weekend is one single minute of excercize... my running plans fell through when I opted for banana walnut pancakes at Polker's instead. Is this half marathon really going to happen for me? I'm feeling doubtful, send me encouraging comments!

      On my seventh birthday my dad bought me a new bicycle. He was currently residing in a motor lodge, near a freeway entrance to the 101, while my parents settled the domestic matters of their impending divorce. On the afternoon of my birthday, my dad took me to Toys'R'us to choose my new wheels. Down that long isle of gleaming bicycles I searched for my match. The one I finally chose had a purple banana seat and tassels hanging from the handle bars. He had to assemble it in the parking lot of the motel with new tools purchased from Kmart that morning. I don't remember a lot from my 7th year, but I distinctly recall riding that newly assembled bike in laps around the parking lot.

      I did a good thing for someone today. At least one good thing that I can think of, maybe I even did more that I'm not remembering.  The person I did this favor for is someone who should have a significant karmic surplus due to the large number of thoughtful and giving things he does daily - not only for me, but for lots of people (and occasionally animals too). I can only hope that this one favor helps tip the karmic scales more in my favor.

      In the lovely linda house we are now members of the Terra Firma CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) and we are receiving a large box of organic, seasonal produce every week. Now on our second week, we have accumulated 12 lovely and fresh ears of corn - just waiting to be boiled or bbq-ed, speared through the ends with little corn forks and nibbled in long rows like a typewriter (ding!). I've been trying to come up with other corn ideas all day and have decided to make summer corn chowder tonight, also utilizing some of the potatoes, red onions and summer squash we have around. I'll let you know how it turns out!  Check out the link and sign up for your own box!

      I have recently become so much more touchy feely than I ever was before. Today I will have my new age moment during my lunchtime restorative yoga class. I will lay in a dark room, using Styrofoam blocks and blanket bolsters and contort my body into pretzel-like positions. If I'm lucky, the instructor will come around with a vial of lavender oil and sprinkle my towel so that I can inhale the scent as I lie there and breathe. I will stretch and inhale deeply and feel my head clear from all the activity, stress and fatigue of my daily routine. I will end the class in a long meditative state (sometime with my legs up a wall) and be awakened by the chime of a bell. When I return to work my body will feel re-energized and my cubicle will feel a little less repressive than usual.

      Besides being totally excited about my new little blog, I've also been preoccupied this week with my new subscription to netflicks. The decision was made recently in the lovely linda household to downscale our cable (RIP HBO). So not only am I going to be hopelessly behind in my viewing of HBO's amazing programming, I'm also now missing all my other wonderful movie channels like Encore and IFC. And I must admit I'm a bit of a TV and movie whore. So I gave myself a little gift of Netflicks and in 5 days have already "queued" 150 movies! It could take me months, or even years to get through all those and I'm looking forward to each and every one. This week alone I've watched Bowling for Columbine and Somethings Gotta Give. I enjoyed both and was surprised in my reaction to both. Bowling because although I agree with a lot of what Michael Moore's message is, he can be really sensational and annoying. I don't remember reacting that way to Roger & Me, but I guess its different now that he is a celebrity in his own right. I loved that he used the Dead Milkmen's "Take the Skinheads Bowling" as an intro, such a great song! I am looking forward to seeing Fahrenheit 911, and hoping he keeps his promise of having less camera time for himself. I do expect more of his eye-rolling theatrics, but don't get me wrong, if that's what it takes to get his message out there, I'm a fan.  And somethings Gotta Give surprised me by being more sweet and less formulaic than I had imagined it would be. And it got me thinking about love and age, I mean why shouldn't people be able to find love again later in life? And stupid men that date girls their daughter's ages are missing out on the beautiful depth, wisdom and maturity of women their own age. Sure, our bodies will age, but can't we see past that?  Anyway, more movies to come soon, I'm expecting the Station Agent and Talk to Her, two reportedly great movies that I missed in the theatres.   I love you net flicks, I love you!

      I've succumbed to the blogging mania that is sweeping the nation and created my very own spot in internet space for my random musings. Why you might ask, do I feel the need to launch my thoughts into the web realm for anybody (or possibly nobody) to stumble upon? Is this just pure narcissism, mixed with an abundance of free time? Yeah, maybe it is a little of that. Yet, I also feel like I might just have my own unique perspective on life that I feel compelled to share.   And really, what could possibly be more interesting than recounting the adventures of La Sassy in SF?

      Sorry this has been slow in the making... things have gotten super busy in my life lately. More on that later. Last weekend's slumber party was so much fun, and had elements of slumber parties past (like junk food, dancing, games) and new elements too (like NO bitchiness or cattiness). Of course, there was the element of alcohol as well, which I never remember having at any of my slumber parties as a kid - really Mom I swear! As every guest arrived at the wonderful home of my chica friend, Michelle, we changed into our PJ's and enjoyed a cup of hot cocoa, with a little kick to it. Michelle's house has a big living room with comfy, plush carpet and tons of huge throw pillows... so it was a perfect area for sleeping bags and lounging. We ate a ton of junk food including my indulgence of Ruffles Cheddar and Sour Cream chips, and animal cookies (the pink and white kind), and pizza and tacos. Then we had an impromptu dance party in the kitchen when someone put the Beyonce album on, and that turned into a limbo contest. After we were pooped from the dancing we plopped down on all the bedding and pillows in the living room and played I Never and Truth or Dare. Kudos to Lianna for her chonie run down the block! I attempted to get a Ouija seance going, but SOME people just couldn't take my efforts to contact the spiritual world seriously. And you know the spirits aren't down with giggles! After all that, a few of us got into a game of "would you rather..." which turned rather dirty, and I have to admit, pretty imaginative. Common themes were genital relocation or removal, incest, bestiality, and consumption of bodily fluids. I won't give you any more further details, but I think you get the point that this was a hard core game! April and Enrique really pushed the envelope a bit.&nbsp; At that point I sort of dozed off with the images of our "would you rather..." game floating through my head, and woke up intermittently from about 2 am to 4 am b/c of either the movie "Shag" on TV, or the mosquito that was eating me alive. Basically, it was your typical sleepover night of no sleep, and girls started stirring around 8 to make breakfast, drink more, be silly, etc. Unfortunately, I was off to work for the day, but was amazingly not feeling awful. All that fun and silliness put me in a good mood for the day, and I made it to 5 pm without curling up under my desk. I must say that I've renewed my love for slumber parties and hope to host or participate in another one soon!

      Okay - so I have heard from everyone I've asked that Dirty Dancing, Havana Nights was just plain awful. Although I was initially excited to see a sequel to one of my all-time favorite movies, after hearing the reviews I didn't go see it. Thanks to netflix, I was able to rent it and watch it last night and I have to say that it wasn't nearly as bad as I'd heard. In fact, I would say it was fairly cute and fun. Not Oscar deserving or anything like that, but very decent fluff. I felt the two characters had good chemistry and the romance was very sweet. The dancing and the music, much like the original, combined music of the time period (1958 Cuba) with more contemporary style music. I was sucked in from the start. I would even consider owning it on DVD and watching it on lazy days... like I do with the original. One thing I'd have to criticize it for, is its lack of a really good finale dance number like the first one. And NO lines as good as&nbsp;"Nobody puts Baby in a corner."

      In a throw back to elementary and junior high days, my chica friends and I&nbsp;are throwing ourselves a slumber party tonight. On the agenda is plenty of junk food consumption, bad eighties/nineties movies, lots of dancing (you know, to teach each other out new moves), games like "Truth or Dare" and "light as a feather, stiff as a bored", prank calling, and probably naked pillow fights. Okay maybe not "naked" but at least "pj-clad" pillow fights. The last slumber party I attended was my pledge retreat during my sorority pledge semester during my freshman year.&nbsp; My highlight of that night was streaking through the streets of Montclair at 2 am! Before that, slumber parties usually didn't involve alcohol, and nudity was confined to trying to remove your training bra without taking off your pj shirt. I remember A LOT of overnight birthday parties I attended as a pre-teen where the group split into two rooms either because of a fight (probably over some deep issue like which New Kid was cuter Jordan or Joe) or because we were forced to split up by some sleep-deprived parent who didn't want to hear another peep out of us. I remember times when I felt left out and pissed off at the group, and other times when I made someone feel that way. I also remember trying to make someone's younger cousin pee in her sleeping bag by putting her hand in warm water... and I definitely remember freezing bras... Why is it that little girls are so damn cruel to each other? But we'll have none of that tonight, I'm sure! ;-)   Wait for the re-cap tomorrow...

      Another busy and wonderful weekend is gone and another long week has started. Jeff and I were blessed with the presence of Casey again, but this time we carted him over to the east bay to stay at Jeff's place in Montclair. We watched a really interesting (and steamy) movie on Friday, "The Dreamers", that is Bernardo Bertelucci's latest film.&nbsp;That was the only steamy and exciting aspect of our Friday night, because&nbsp;I had to get up bright and early to take a practice LSAT on Saturday at the Kaplan in Berkeley that was so horribly disorganized, I&nbsp;felt completely validated in my decision to handle my LSAT&nbsp;studying on my own. After 3-hours of strenuous&nbsp;mental activity, all I wanted to do was re-fuel and relax. So, Jeff, Casey and I headed down to 4th street to eat yummy tacos at Tacubaya and shop the anthropogie and other 4th st. shop sales. Down there we encountered the usual kitty and puppy adoption booths with their crates and pens of adorable animals, just yearning to go home with you.&nbsp; One in particular, a 10-week old rott/shepard-mix looking mutt boy, was especially adorable and needing to go home with us. But, we resisted and walked away. I know there's another puppy out there for us... and hopefully soon we'll find him/her :-( So, being sad about leaving that little guy, I was luckily cheered up with some gelato from Eccolo. I stopped in to say hello to Samin and she gave me a taste of peach and honey gelato. The honey flavor was incredible! My new favorite. We then helped Samin move a couch into her new fabulous Berkeley abode and we all got spiffed up for our dinner at Eccolo. That dinner should be a whole other blog unto itself, but let me just say we ate a TON of fabulous food, with a big group of friends and had a really nice, totally grown-up style evening! Sunday I studied LSAT for several hours (because I rock and because I had a few hours to kill at the ferry building waiting for my mom who had MISSED her ferry!). Then my mom and I went to see the Geisha exhibit at the Asian Art museum. It was a really wonderful exhibit, and I do think the Geisha culture has a lot of beauty and intrigue, it does seem like a tradition that caters to men's fantasies, which seem to&nbsp;be a subservient, flirtatious, shallow (as in keeps the conversation "light"), etc. I think they are wonderfully talented in the arts that they learn, but it bothered me watching them giggle at these ridiculous men and play the role for them that they are hired to perform. I suppose its like acting, and they can separate who they really are from their Geisha character, but it would be very hard for me to do! Anyway, my mom and I had a nice time together and ended it with amazing gelato from Ciao Bella at the ferry building. I had lemon and rose - they were both amazing! Then I went home and studied more LSAT with Jeff and Casey. Casey is really good at the reading comprehension!

      This week has flown by, and I've been so busy I've hardly had a chance to post to my lovely blog. I apologize to all my loyal readers - I hope I haven't lost you from my laziness. For reals, I've hardly been lazy at all. I decided last week to take the LSAT on October 2, and because September is going to be a crazy month for me (going to Denver, finding a new place&nbsp;with my LTR, and moving), I am trying to study as much as I can now. Last weekend Jeff helped me set up a table in my room to serve as my study area, and a few of my fellow LSAT-taking friends have loaned me study materials from their courses. For those that aren't familiar, here's a brief education in the LSAT - it consists of 3&nbsp;types of questions&nbsp;(4 sections): 1 section reading comprehension, 1 section games (not like candy land or anything like that), and 2 sections arguments, plus some writing sample that apparently no one reads, and its all out of 180 points. Anyway, so I am pouring over methods to attack these problems, and working on as many practice problems as I can handle. Tomorrow morning I'm taking a full blown, proctored, practice test to see how I'm scoring.&nbsp; I have no idea what goal to set for myself because I have not idea what I'm capable of scoring. Plus, since I don't know where I'd want to go to school (if I do decide to go to law school) its hard to know what I need to get. I guess I just want to do the best I can possibly do and kick that LSAT's b-u-t-t, but we'll see. I guess a 180 would be good, wouldn't it? But really... I think a 165 is a solid, good, impressive score and would make up for my not totally impressive GPA. So far, I think I'm doing well on the arguments (are any of you suprised about that?!), pretty well on the reading comprehension, and so-so on the games. Ironically, I LOVE doing the games and look forward to practicing them, b/c they're so fun... they can just be so hard. The "games" are usually those types of logic puzzles where you have to figure out who brought the cheese dip to the party and if Betty&nbsp;arrived before or after Suzie&nbsp;&nbsp;... things like that. I'm sure that's totally a useful skill to have as a lawyer when you're organizing the office potluck.  &nbsp;  Another aspect of my LSAT studying is my decision not to shell out a gazillion dollars (or a thousand) to take a prep course from Kaplan or Princeton Review (and that's no diss to you Dre), or whoever. Don't get me wrong, I think they're valuable, but that's just too much damn money right now and I think that you can get the same preparation if you are disciplined. And so far I am. All I want to do right now is practice LSAT b/c, like I said, I want to kick some booty on it. I'm motivated right now, so if I can keep that up, I think I'll be good.  &nbsp;  Okay I've rambled on enough.&nbsp;Send me any advice you have for standardized test&nbsp;prep, or your LSAT anecdotes, or ultimatums that you'll disown me as a friend if I&nbsp;become a blood-sucking leech of a lawyer (I swear I won't, I'll only use the law to help people and do good in the world&nbsp;:-) ).&nbsp;

      On Saturday I went on the most ridiculously hilarious wild goose chase through Sonoma, looking for Cannard Farm, the farm ran by "Bob" that grows almost all of the produce for Chez Panisse. Jeff has never been there, I have been there once, and Samin has been there between 8 and 20 times. Bob, the farmer is rumored to be a bit of a hermit, but takes care of an amazing beautiful plot of land in the Sonoma valley and cultivates some of the most delicious produce I've ever had. According to Samin, the farm is located past a fork/triangle type intersection, near two churches, in a stoplight-less span of road, by some trees, and on a road that is either alta mira, sobre vista, or something linda. We followed our instincts (mostly Samin's - altering from "this is defnitely it" to "we're totally in the wrong place" back to "we're close jsut keep going 5 more minutes") for almost an hour and thought we had most definitely found the driveway to the farm when we debated whether or not it was appropriate for us to visit a quasi-aqaintance of Samin's at 7:30 pm on a Saturday night. We hadn't really considered that part of it yet. We decided to drive down the road and Samin would duck, and Jeff and I could just be lost tourists. So we headed down the road with Samin screaming "Bob might get mad" and "he might throw things at us" when we encountered the end of the road and a sign saying it was Patty and David's house ahead, or something like that. So, Bob's farm is not on Sobre Vista Dr. We turned around and headed home, though Samin swears it must have been there somewhere. For an almost-adventure, it was pretty wild!

      Sunday at 2:00pm in Dolores Park the SF symphony is performing a free concert. I plan on going a little early to stake out a good spot. Give me a call on Sunday if you want to meet up. Maybe we could all bring some wine to share?

      Ow - my head hurts. I got a little carried away in the celebration of Aprils 26th year last night and maybe over did it a teeny tiny bit on the minty mojitos at chachacha. It was a huge group, at least 20, of all her various friends (roommates, college friends, her crrrrazy co-workers and both her bosses). My favorite part of the night had to of been when she introduced the bartender to her boss as "one of the guys she's hooked up with". He was mighty flustered and brought on the free drinks after that! April, Jeff and I were the last three left at the bar after dinner and Apes and I slurringly confessed our undying friendship to each other - I think Jeff observed it all in horror of our girly emotionalness. Now I'm suffering the consequences, but also feeling like it was worth it. I do have to say that I'm vowing to avoid ChaChaCha for at least a week or so!

      I feel like this week is just starting for me and its already Wed. Not that I'm upset that the weekend is almost here again! Although I did work yesterday, I didn't get home from Sausalito house-sitting to casa de las lindas until last night. I was really happy to get back to the city and home to my lovely linda roommies, my own bed, fridge, closet, etc... but I must say that Jeff and I had a really wonderful weekend in Sausalito. A looooong weekend since we were there since Thursday. We had such a great time, I don't even know where to start... In no particular order and because I seem to enjoy making lists so much here are some of the reasons my weekend was wonderful...  First , I just love the Engel family dog, Casey. He's my first real and true dog love and now I am certifiabley dog obsessed. We spent a lot of the weekend playing with him, petting him, taking him out, buying him treats (at fancy schmancy George on 4th st) and just generally ogling him. I wish that we could have a dog. My parents are getting a new puppy named Bailey this week, so hopefully I will fall madly in love with him too and can hold off my own dog urges for awhile. Is this what it feels like to have baby urges? Right now I'd much prefer a puppy!  Second , Jeff and I spent much of the weekend laying around, playing scrabble, eating yummy food (ahi fish tacos!), drinking wine, doing crosswords and just having some much needed down time together. On the 4th we mixed margaritas in water bottles and walked with Casey down to the waterfront to watch the Sausalito fireworks, it was really nice.   Third , I saw my wonderful friend Samin in Berkeley and after Thai Temple brunch, we got to see the new restaurant she's working in, Eccolo. Being around Samin always makes me feel positive and creative and I missed her a lot while she was gone, so it was great to be spending time with her again. I can't wait to do all kinds of fun projects with her and to visit her at Eccolo soon!  Fourth , I got to spend time with my family on Saturday, eat hot dogs, and watch Jeff being dragged around by my 3 year old nephew who cried when he left. The only down side to that is my that my entire family keeps telling me "Jeff is soooo good with kids" so they either want us to babysit or procreate immediately. C'mon people, let's put the horse before the cart (or however that particular saying goes!)  As much as I wish our life were like that (suburban and domestic and mellow) all the time, I am really looking forward to spending a few more years in the city and enjoying the young, urban life (does that mean I'm a yuppie?!). I especially want to enjoy these last three months in the mission before Jeff and I nest in our new place. The mission can be such a wonderful area to be in, I know I'm going to miss it. It can also smell like pee and vomit, so in other ways, I'm ready for something new!

      I really appreciated your comments last week when I was feeling a little caca. Not to sound trite, but I really feel lucky to have some many wonderful and different friends. Life would really be caca without you!

      Today is Miss Godette's 26th birthday - so send her b-day wishes, or even better prank phone call her or leave really long messages on her machine! Her number is 565-0505!

      I somehow deleted my blog last weekend, so this one is brand new, without any fancy customizations. I will get the "tonight on netflix" and other fun sidebars up and running again, just as soon as I read about html again. Who knew blogging could be so complicated?  And more about my wonderful weekend later. I'll leave you with my funny moment of the day, I heard on the radio that today is George Dubya's b-day and I heard a funny song entitled "faithless" with the lyrics "fear is a weapon of mass destruction". So clever, and so true.

      Yesterday I was in one of those moods where every little thing got on my nerves - including not remembering to buy my new fast pass and having to pay for my morning bart ride, then waiting in a ridiculously long line after work to buy it. Then I had an annoyingly long drive down Van Ness in traffic (hitting every stop light and stuck behind some idiot riding their breaks the whole way) on my way to Sausalito. However, there were a few little things that really brightened my day yesterday and I'm feeling the need to share:  1) I held a Crow position in yoga for a few seconds. This may not sound like much, but Crow is super hard for me b/c it involves strength and balance, not my top skills. For those that don't know Crow is balancing your knees on your elbows, supporting your weight on your hands, and lifting your feel off the ground. Its amazining how every teeny tiny advancement in yoga makes me feel fantastic.   2) We got tomatoes in the terra firma box yesterday! We got a mix of what I think are early girl, cherry, something yellow (taxi or something else), and a brandywine (is that what they're called)? It's an education in tomatoes at my house! I used two in a veggie pasta I made last night, though I think they should be eaten just raw to be fully appreciated. The red ones are perfectly red all the way through and sweet. What are those weird tomatoes with white insides that they sell at the supermarket? Obviously not tomatoes. Now that I've experienced so much organic, perfect produce, its hard to imagine shopping at Safeway or something like that. Forgive me for my food snobbery!  3) I "found" a funny story someone wrote on the back of a flyer on the street yesterday. I have recently discovered Found Magazine, and spent the past month with my eyes pointed downward looking for some discarded note or picture, but hadn't "found" anything until yesterday. I plan to send it in and hope it gets posted. If you haven't yet, check out their website - I've included the link in this post. It totally changes your perception of litter!  And that's it - plus of course, Jeff is back for Tejas, I'm staying in Sausalito with Casey, its a 3-day weekend, and I'm having lunch with the Chicas today. No more bad moods!

      (Caution - this is a very self-conscious blog entry)  I feel like I've been so busy with work, life, etc. that I've hardly had a moment to post interesting entries to my blog. To all my loyal fans, I apologize - but can I ask one thing of you? If you could all leave a comment once in awhile, I'd feel so loved. Maybe my posts have gotten a bit mundane in the past week and you're not inspired to comment, so I'll try and work on that.

      I feel like many people I know have been enjoying a "brush with fame" this week.  Like my BFF Enrique who is auditioning this weekend to be a backup dancer for Destiny's Child. However, not being a professional dancer (yet) he doesn't have a headshot. So, who came to his rescue? None other than his amazing BFF (that would be me) with ny new digital camera. So today, at work, we snuck into an unused office and had a photo shoot. I can now say I know how it feels to be a professional photographer! Luckily we managed to get a great, very professional-looking, shot and get it printed and blown-up to 8x10 size. So now if he gets the job, he owes all his success to me and must bring me as his date to the MTV Video Awards show. Watch for me in US Weekly people!  And then there's another person I know who went on a few dates this week with the son of a pretty well-known musician and even got to meet his dad and dad's other musician friends last night.  Who's next? I hope its me!

      So tomorrow may just be the day when Jeff and I sign the lease on our new place. But then again it may not be as the situation at my old place is not yet settled. I'm really just dreaming of this move being done and sitting in my new place by the water with Jeff. Too bad we can't have a dog to cuddle up at our feet, but maybe a picture of Casey will suffice.   In the moment (where my yoga teacher reminded me today I should be) ... I'm enjoying my new minigreen ipod immensely and listening to music during my commute and at my desk.... I dusted off my LSAT books and am getting back into study mode after a brief hiatus...I'm preparing for my cousin's wedding shower this weekend with fun games and prizes... I'm thinking of KD tonight while she enjoys a Crosby, Stills, and Nash concert in NY with a cute boy... I'm taking good care of Linz and Dwight's place while they're in Hawaii... I'm loving taking pictures of Casey with my new camera... I'm thinking of chocolate from fog city news...  Oh and, last night Jeff and I irreverently acted out a phone call between Scott Peterson and Amber Frey. It was the funniest thing we've done in awhile, and I must say we did a damn good job.

      I find myself today in a mood of total excitement. I feel like a million wonderful things are happening and I don't even know on which I should focus my attention. These are them:  1) Moving in with my most wonderful boyfriend... we may or may not have a place yet, but we're definitely going to have one very soon. I am so lucky to have such a sweet, funny, smart, caring and just all around awesome person to cohabitate with. I can't wait to make every little decision about our new place with him.  2) My new Mini Green ipod is so fabulous.  3) Dog sitting Casey this week and seeing Bailey this weekend in Santa Rosa. Dogs are wonderful creatures.  4) KD's new love interest in NYC who sounds amazing.  5) My new pink converse.  6) My upcoming acing of the LSAT and then my celebration trip to Hawaii.  7) ... and I'm still on a high from the most amazing birthday ever!

         Pyramid Tartare  at Blowfish (w/ salmon, tuna and avocado - served WT style with potato chips!), plus the  Peach Nympho  sake drink with nigori and peach juice was amazing!  A  Mitchell's ice cream birthday cake  (w/ Hawaii decorations), white cake and coffee ice cream, Jeff I LOVE YOU!!!   My other birthday cake made by the chicas with  chocolate cake  and frosting eaten at my house at 2:30 am on Friday night. I personally licked "a piece" of the frosting off myself.   Chilaquiles  with green sauce from Puerto Alegre. The best cure for a hangover.  Everything I had at Delfina on Sunday night including:  fried squash blossoms  stuffed with Ricotta,  raviolis with walnut sauce ,  albacore tuna  with green and cranberry beans, and  profiteroles  with espresso gelato and chocolate sauce, Yumm!!!

      To all of my wonderful friends and family that made my brithday AMAZING - thank you. I felt incredibly special to have so many great people help my celebrate my 25th birthday. I had a blast at dinner and doing the mission bar crawl... and to everyone who couldn't be there, but called, e-mail, etc... thank you too! I'm such a lucky girl.  BTW to all you bar crawlers... WE ROCK! We made it from start to finish... and all in time to hit the 500 Club by 2 am. And those that came back to 51 Linda afterwards, enjoyed the yummy Chica cake, and got to play spin the bottle!

      Looks like we found a place right near Marina green and only a few blocks from Chestnut.  We might be signing a lease soon. Mauna Loa here we come!

      I really do, and I feel bad about it. I have this horrible stereotype about people that live in the marina, despite knowing some nice people that live in that area. I tend to think that all Marina people are affluent, vapid, homogeneous, shallow, etc... and I can't seem to get over this idea that by living there I would somehow become one of those people are just be really unhappy that I was surrounded by THEM. I know its a horrible generalization, and I've tried to see past it, but its pretty well ingrained in me.  Last night Jeff and I went to see a few apartments in the Marina area. Though obviously not my top choice of areas to live in, it would be an ideal area for Jeff to commute from, and convenient enough for me to get to work. Not to mention that the Marina is a beautiful area, with the water front within spitting distance. Despite my bias, I wanted to be fair to Jeff and consider it in our list of areas. The places we saw were mostly not that nice for the price. We did see one fairly decent place, but it is right on Van Ness, and not as nice as other places we have seen elsewhere for the same price or even less. I think we've realized we're better off in another area. Pheww... and I didn't have to seem like a total bitch for just not wanting to live there.

      Pardon my complete obnoxiousness, but people have been asking... not that anyone is required to buy me a gift, but if you feel the urge, here are 10 things I'm wishing for:  1) Dirty Dancing Havana Nights on DVD (Don't everyone rush out at once to get this) 2) Le Creuset non-stick spatulas (I lost my other ones in my last move) 3) Dagoba chocolate bars!! 4) Lavender smelling things 5) Pictures of puppies, b/c I can't have one and I'm that annoying person now 6) New agey things like crystals and incense (J/K) 7) Something from Good Vibes ;-) 8) Mani/Pedi gift certificates!! 9) A copy of your favorite book/CD 10) Queen-size, at least 300 thread count Egyptian Cotton sheets - for those of you on a budget!  However your PRESENCE at my birthday celebration on Friday night would be the best gift of all! ... first at Blowfish for dinner, then onto a Mission bar crawl. If you can't make it, gifts will be accepted!

      Did the weekend really go so fast? I feel like I had hardly a moment to enjoy it, relax, study for LSAT, etc. Jeff and I managed to spend just about every waking moment either bouncing between open houses, or searching for new listings on Craigslist. And after probably 15 actual viewings, 10 or more drive-bys, and hours (6+) looking at hundreds of listings on craigslist, we have about 3 possibilities. We have only submitted an application for one of them and are keeping the other 2 in mind for back-ups IF we find nothing else, and they're still available. It is such a tiring process looking for a perfect place, and when we finally do, we have the whole headache of moving to deal with. Not to sound too down on the whole thing, I am so excited to live with Jeff in a new place (a new area probably), re-organize and downsize all my stuff, focus on LSAT studying, and then take off on our two week trip to Hawaii! I just hope once we do find this place, we stay there for awhile!
