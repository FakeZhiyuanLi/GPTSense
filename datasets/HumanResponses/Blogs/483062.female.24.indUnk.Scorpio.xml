      I am a food addict to the core.   Today is Day 4 and I feel great. I think that this plan will be really successful because on it, I don't have to make decisions regarding food. The answer is simply no. There is no room to push the envelope--either I'm drinking a shake or I'm cheating. On other plans I'd always try to see what I could get away with. As a result, I'd always end up feeling guilty, then eventually falling off the plan completely.  I am a food addict who cannot forgive herself for mistakes.  I'm proud of who I am, but I want to change. Put that behind me.   10 reasons why i need to lose weight:  1) my self esteem 2) my confidence in myself 3) my strong desire to look good 4) none of my clothes fit! 5) make me more comfortable in my personal relationships 6) make me less reluctant to go into social situations 7) health reasons 8) to inspire others 9) to change the way others perceive me 10) because I am beautiful underneath all this fat!!

      Weighed in at a whopping 218 at 7am. Then went down there fully dressed and weighed inat 210. I don't know if the scale works but everyone says it does. I was told to just accept the fact that I'm fat now and work to change it.  Hence, I'm almost done with my first day of full fasting.  I thought it would be a breeze, but I already miss food. I hung out with a friend today who reminds me of the "good old days" of eating nonstop. Then again... those days were not so good... Look where it got me!  I don't know how I will make it through the whole 5 months but like everyone is telling me--one day at a time. I'll try to focus on getting through each day individually. Also, in the beginning of the day it was easier for me to drink this water but now its nearly 9pm and I still have more water to drink. Hopefully I'll be done within the next 30 minutes. I was a little worried because I felt slightly nauseous after my second shake. The vanilla shake tastes good at first but then somewhere down the line it loses me.

      The more memorable events of yesterday included me having no shame in purchasing a bunch of junk food from the gas station. The attendant asked, "Is all of this yours?" I shamefully said yes. In my fog, I couldn't even hear the total right and handed him over seven dollars instead of the $3.55 I owed him.  But that wasn't all that happened yesterday. Yesterday, I went with my mom to get my nails done. Waited over 2 hours just for them to get started. NEVER AGAIN!!! But, sitting in the salon for so many hours gave me some ideas for things to distract me from what I'm about to do. I found the business card of a hair stylist who is offering a monthly hair management program: 3 shampoos/sets & one perm/touchup/ one deep condition treatment for $135 a month. Not bad at all. So every week, I'll get my hair done to keep myself looking good. I have a short haircut now so this works out great. Every two weeks I will get my nails done (at somewhere other than where I went yesterday).  Also, I heard of a soap called Black Soap that helps eliminate stretch marks. My rapid weight gain caused several groups of stretch marks to emerge. I will use that soap every day and by the time I reach my goal weight, hopefully they'll be gone. Also, I will thoroughly rub myself down with Cocoa Butter after my shower each day.   Finally, my sister is on Jenny Craig--she's lost a lot of weight and she compliments her weight loss every month with  urlLink Body Wraps . A Body Wrap is a service in which you are totally wrapped up from head to toe and at the end of the process, you are expected to lose 10 to 20 inches.  I think all of those activities are enough to keep me distracted and feeling good on my journey to slimdom.   Why do I want to lose weight?   Well, I came up with 10 reasons that I'll post later. I need to print out those reasons and also a before picture to carry around with me.

      I wish I could have the confidence to say that I'm starting Saturday, no excuses. However, Father's Day is Sunday, and I cannot 100% say that it will be easy for me to brush off dinner at the Golden Corral or something. I'd better not take the risk. After Father's Day, there will be no more interruptions as I head towards my goal.   I've been doing a lot of thinking... and going back and forth a lot. Should I start exercising immediately? Should I exercise hard or soft? What time should I wake up? Etc etc. I'm just so worried about doing this perfectly. I've screwed up so much in the past but I feel in my heart that this time will be different. This program is the answer to a prayer I made one hopeless morning.  Anyway, I've decided to start the program on Monday, and to leave exercising out for now. I can't do 10 million things at the same time. That is what has screwed me up so much in the past. I try to be perfect, and when I can't maintain that perfection--I let go completely almost to the point of anti-perfection. Not this time. This time I'm taking things slowly.

      Clarification: From what I'm reading, Medifast is just like Optifast, without the doctor's fees. I'm still waiting for the products to arrive. :-)

      Early yesterday morning, I woke up, miserable... wondering how exactly I would get out of this fat-fiasco I've found myself in. You see, last year this time I was 40 pounds slimmer--and at that time I was 20 pounds heavier than I was at the beginning of the year. That equals a 60 pound weight gain in less than two years! On my way up to this point, I had tried several diets here and there but I'd always quit, and of course, the result was always an increase in my size.   Anyway, yesterday, I woke up feeling that same hopelessness. The feeling of-- what am I going to do now??  I began reading Oprah's book, "Making The Connection," and I got to the part where she talked about how she went from 237 pounds to 142 pounds in FOUR MONTHS while using the Optifast diet program! She noted how the weight came back with a vengeance though--but I thought--why not me? I can handle it! If I lose the weight I won't f*ck up like Oprah did! This is my last stop. I NEED this! Failure is no longer an option. If I fail at this, I will be resigned to fatdom for all eternity.  The diet supplies will get here by Thursday or Friday. I will document every moment of this fasting experience. I will use it as a spiritual journey, a journey that will hopefully make me a better person inside and out. Stay tuned!  By the way, I will not be posting pictures until I know whether or not this diet works. I'm not ready for the world to see me fat like this. I will post my starting weight on the day when I start the diet.

      The other day I had an interesting conversation with a friend. She parallels prayer to self hypnosis. Well, regardless, I truly must testify that prayer really works. A little over a month ago I was literally in hell, but now for the first time in months I see a way out. I feel so blessed and so grateful to God for these blessings. Medifast was not even a thought on my radar screen until after I prayed for help. I'm going to turn all my major life decisions over to God--everything from dating, to financial help, to just about anything that affects me.

      This past week has been slightly stressful in that a dear friend of mine was in town and of course, she wanted to go out to eat. I did keep it low carb, still, its stressful to see the added pound the next day. No matter how moderate I keep the meal, I am always a pound heavier by the next morning. Weighed in today at 180.5. I know it'll be gone by tomorrow but it still feels like I'm going backwards. Maybe I should try harder to resist food next time...

      I never thought I'd be this happy to be in the 170s. 170 is traditionally associated with the word "nightmare" for me. But not this time, as I'm down 30.5 pounds from the unbelievable weight of 180! I'm so happy!

      I'm just over 30 days into the program (thank goodness I'm losing count) and I'm now at 180 pounds! I've NEVER lost weight anywhere near this fast before (although, again, I've never been anywhere near this big before). I have really changed! I've moved on from my slip up (something I've NEVER been able to do in the past, especially under these circumstances). All I have to say is that faith and spirituality is a strong part of my program. My daily readings and meditations keep me focused and grounded. I know in my heart that this time I have no choice but to continue in the program---otherwise, accept a life as a fat girl---something I cannot do.&nbsp; What does one do when he/she is completely and utterly ashamed of his/her own body? Prayer really does work... It seems as though I'm renewed. I'm not struggling like I was before. I think for a while near the end of the first month I had slipped out of ketosis even though I was doing everything right. I'm definately back in it though, if my dry mouth is any indication. Well, happy shaking!

      There was a point yesterday where I was resigned to failure---I was about to eat again! But I looked in the fridge, and sure enough, my shakes were already made and ready to drink so I was saved. Had it not been for the already made shakes, I would have been eating all day yesterday. &nbsp; Today I rewarded on the scale. I'm down to 183 now. 27 pounds lost in 29 days! I guess I won't meet the 30 pound goal for the month, but that's OK. Progress--not perfection--is what&nbsp;counts.  &nbsp; These next few days will really be hard, I can tell. I'm already feeling down on myself; and that time of the month is coming... Stay tuned...

      Yesterday, I really did slip up--and I feel very ashamed. I feel like scum, like dirt, like a&nbsp;very weak person. I've read stories of people who've stayed on the full fast from 4 months, to almost a year--yet I broke at day 27!! BUT... I have such a long way to go that I cannot afford to give up like I have in the past after making mistakes... I must move forward... &nbsp; Yesterday was full of signs of my impending slip up... I didn't make my shakes... I doubled up on the soups (as flavorless as they are)... and I thought about going modified... &nbsp; Ahhh, the medifast&nbsp;soups... They are horrible but yet after eating them I lost control. I guess cause I was longing for so much more than what I got. The one thing that I'm proud of is that I insisted on getting food that would do the least damage. I settled in on half a personal pan pizza and 8 or so baked wings. It was not even that good... Total damage done? I weighed in today at 184.5. I haven't been weighing daily, but I do know that my period is scheduled to start today and I weighted 183.5 yesterday. So, basically I got away easy this time. &nbsp; What troubles me is what I read in my Daily Overeater Meditation guide--I wish to God that was the page I had been given yesterday. It said, breaking abstinence is like jumping off a skyscraper and expecting to only go down to the next floor--after a cheat, I may manage to get my eating under control for a day or a few weeks, but nothing will change the downward spiral. Now that is depressing! It's basically saying that I'm destined to fail now. Intellectually, I know the meal I had yesterday was not that far off from the modified plan. Its just that I vowed to myself that I would stay on. I got carried away. &nbsp; How to avoid this in the future... &nbsp; Well, yesterday I was so excited about going furniture shopping that I through all caution to the wind. Its easy to maintain control in the house with all my shakes at my disposal. When I go out in public though--making and packing the shakes is A MUST. Carrying the packets around is NOT enough and will not save me from disaster. If I had simply tried to pack my shakes to take along with me, something in me might have stopped me from eating. I've made it through situations TEN TIMES WORSE before--shame on me. The true shame, however, would be if I couldn't pick myself back up from this minor incident. The next week or so will be extremely hard work as I try to redeem myself... &nbsp; Plan? Drink 120 oz of water a day, 5 shakes a day, no soups, no exceptions!!

      I don't know what happened to my motivation. Was it my decision to weigh in that has me fighting to hold on these days? What is wrong? I feel miserable. Everyday at home I have to smell the foods that I abused so carelessly in the past. I feel weak. All I can do is retreat to my room, bitterly waiting for the Medifast Soup to arrive. I've had nothing but shakes for 24 days. At first I was reluctant to use the other supplements but now I can't wait. I know of many people who also have found success mixing modified with the full fast, but I know in my heart that I cannot combine the two if I am serious about losing weight. I'm feeling miserable. Waiting for my period to arrive and hurry up and get the hell out my way. All I can do is look forward to the day when the scale reads 120. This is really a test of my faith and endurance, but I guess that's a good thing. How would I grow in character if this process were completely easy? One of the things that I wanted was a spiritual journey. Well guess what? No better way to get spiritual and grow my relationship with God than to pray during my weakest moments.   As a food addict, I've admitted that I am powerless over food. Now that I write this, I remember my desperation and hopelessness of just a few weeks ago. Before learning that I could do Medifast, I literally felt trapped and like I could never get back on track again. For the first time, I felt hope and faith--faith that I tarnished with my insistence on weighing. Maybe I'll leave the scale alone completely from now on.  But at the same time, I also feel like I should be charting my progress for future reference. Maybe just pray and have faith and forget the scale... Something that maybe will become clearer as I pray and meditate. These are the days when I REALLY REALLY need prayer and meditation. Before I didn't need it. Now my daily meditation guides are a Godsend.  I'm glad I wrote this.   It puts things in perspective. Who said a fast was supposed to be a piece of cake?  Right now I'm fighting the battle of my life---the same battle that I have lost many times over starting as far back as 15.   At 15, I suddenly went from 115 or so to 125, and then to 130, and then to 135. I remember the alarm people expressed. I was in complete denial. Still, I never really attempted to do anything about it. Well, at that time I had no idea about diets like Atkins, etc. I thought the only way to lose weight was to not eat, and sadly there were one or two occassions when I completely stopped eating for the day.  When I went off to college (at 17), my weight was around 130 to 140. I remember I literally stored dozens of Coca Cola bottles in my dorm room. Its amazing to me that I didn't blow up. Instead, the opposite happened. I was in ROTC, and eventually I had to start exercising and getting in shape. Though I didn't notice it at the time, I was shrinking. At that time, I knew I was kind of overweight, but I wasn't actively trying to do something about it. By the time Christmas Vacation came around, my parents and friends back home were astounded to see the new me. I was around 120 pounds. Everyone said I looked great! I didn't even realize I had become so small.  That break was a turning point; however. My dad bought several sheet cakes home to celebrate my success. I quickly settled back into my old ways. I ate ate and ate. I LOVE sheet cake! In two weeks, I was back up to 140.   That was the beginning of my weight roller coaster. My first official attempt at eating healthy, as misguided as it was, I believe took place around the age of 18. I ate low fat everything, sometimes restricting myself to one meal a day. I worked out faithfully for a good few weeks, and I took diet pills. The results were immediate. At that time, I had blown up to 160 pounds. In a few weeks, I was down 10 pounds, settling around 145 to 150 pounds.  Still, the drama taking place in my life (by this time, I had already transferred to another university) had a serious effect on my weight. I found my way back up to 160, and ended up leaving ROTC in semi-disgrace.  Again, I came home and lost the weight. Got down to around 150 by the time I transferred to my third university, and then after living in the dorms, I was back to around 140.  Looking back, I see now that my weight was usually under control when I was away from my family and their constant talk of weight. I remember seeing my sister and friends for a party in '99, and after everyone told me how great I looked, I started to lose control with my eating. I was perfectly fine, and actually getting smaller, until they insisted on pointing out how my physical appearance was.  Maybe I felt unloved. Maybe I felt that people were judging me over my physical appearance...   I eventually gained the weight again... Actually I hovered around 155 until I had the not so brilliant idea to start Atkins, the diet I had heard so much about.  Now THAT was the beginning of my yo yo, compulsive style eating phase. To make a long story short, I yo yoed my way to 175 to 180. As bad as it was, I got through it, settling back at 140. But not for long, I yo yo'd back and forth, vowing not to ever reach 175 again.   Then, I stopped the diligence. I let my guard down and the pounds crept on. This is how I found my way to the forbidden 200s.   When I first got on the scale at 200, I cried the entire day. I felt like shit. Then something in me became numb, and I actually proceeded to put on more weight! I tried a couple of times, half heartedly, to get it under control. But I just couldn't. I knew my battle with food had reached an all time low. To get to 140, I'd have to lose 60 to 70 pounds. It all seemed so impossible. But 140 was not even my goal! My goal is 120---making it necessary for me to lose almost 100 POUNDS!!!  This is why I cannot quit now. Its day 24 for me now, and as of yesterday I have lost 26 pounds. I have 64 more pounds to go to get to my goal, and I will do it--one day at  a time. I'm so grateful to be on Medifast right now. I will fight to maintain my abstinence from harmful foods.

      So you won't lose it overnight?  Well, that may be the case for some, but I pretty much did gain my weight overnight. So I pretty much expect to lose the weight overnight. The weight gain was so fast that it left me clueless about my true state of obesity for many months. It hit me like a ton of bricks when I learned my true standing.  Anyway, its Day 23 for me now. I believe this is officially the longest I've ever been on a diet. As of this morning,  I am down 26 pounds!  I gave up on the whole notion of not weighing for four months. Once you begin weighing, it is almost addictive! Each time I weigh, I'm fearful of there having been some sort of mistake with my weight the previous day. Anyway, gotta run!

      Gosh, I'm on Day 12. I'm not sure if it's just my resolve or what but I'm going through this plan almost effortlessly. I have several routines now. My hair is looking great--getting it done every week and that has proven to be a really great idea. Liquid diets are not that bad--and this is coming from a food addict! The catch is, if you do a modified liquid diet (meaning some food allowed) then it will be A LOT harder. With me, there is a clear boundary, so I have nothing to feel guilty about which could in turn lead me to eat.

      Something is bothering me, and now come to think of it, it may not even be this program. I've been feeling kind of sad--the only thing I do is look forward to the next weighing, hanging my entire self esteem/mood on the results of the weigh in. Yet there are a lot of troubling things going on in my life that I now have to deal with and that are more likely the cause of my restlessness. I ate 7 supplements yesterday instead of the regular 5. My weight? The same as yesterday.

      I'm lying here, desperate to maintain control, urging myself to move forward on the plan. Tonight I had six supplements instead of the usual five. I'm on shaky ground... I need to stay focused. Sometimes, a lot of times, I have good days. Other times, I find this plan to be extremely hard and unnatural. I miss food, I grieve for food. I grieve for the time when I would carelessly eat whatever I chose. Yet, I know that those were definitely not "the good ol' days." I was in hell. The proof is in writing. The proof is in the numbers on the scale. I'm in limbo, but at least I'm headed towards my goal. May God grant me the strength to carry on... I really need it.

      Although I wish it would move faster, that averages to about 3.5 pounds a week. I'm wondering whether I should do some stretching exercises today or just chill... Weighed in today at 174---36 pounds lost in 47 days.

      Lately I've been putting a lot of thought into my maintenance plan, and I guess it has me feeling kind of down because I have such a long way to go. At the very least, I have to lose 35 pounds to get to a more comfortable size. All I do is drink shakes. Its kind of depressing. I wish I could eat like other people eat.  I have been very unproductive all week. When I get home, I think I'm just going to go to sleep and watch TV. That's all I can do until this weight comes off. Going out only reminds me of what I'm missing.

      I woke up this morning and thought to myself ..."There is no way in hell that I'm going to get up out of this bed and go running..."  And with that, my pledge to run every day came to an abrupt end. Truth is, I should have stuck to the  urlLink 5K training program  but I guess I can resume that at any time. The thing that really kept me from running today is I went against my other pledge not to weigh, and when I saw that I had only lost half a pound, I decided that it was not worth it to be sore from overdoing it. I'll see what the scale says tomorrow and then I might retry my challenge or go back to the more moderate training program.

      I noticed a definite slow down in my weight loss. One day I even noticed a half pound gain although I did nothing wrong. So I've started working out, training to run 5K. During the period since starting I've lost 2 pounds, but right now its unclear whether that is due to the Medifast or the working out, or whether I would have lost more without the working out. Either way, in my heart I know that working out ultimately will help and not hurt me. Also, I've grown accustomed to the Medifast soup. I can't get enough of it now, but I am dutifully restricting it to twice a day.
