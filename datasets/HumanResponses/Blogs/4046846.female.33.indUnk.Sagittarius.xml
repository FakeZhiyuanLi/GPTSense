       60 minutes in-line skating    Just got back from skating for about an hour with Doug and Wendy. Nice to have some company, though it's hard to carry on really good conversations with having to skate in single file.  Found a great little coffee shop on Leary that's right near where I end my skating. The woman working there was super sweet and she makes good coffee. I'll head back there, especially since she doesn't mind if we come in on skates.  Quads are much happier today.  I guess I'm getting used to it.

       5 minute warmup   20 minutes run/walk   5 minute cooldown/stretch   Energy level: okay        Today's workout (from the C25K site): Brisk five-minute warmup walk. Then alternate 60 seconds of jogging and 90 seconds of walking for a total of 20 minutes.  Well, one week down!  I think I'm going to have to switch to M/W/F. I just got back from my third run of the week and it's 1:30. It's one thing to get up 1/2 hour earlier on a work day to squeeze in a run, it's entirely another to have to do it on a Saturday morning. Up too late last night which meant I was hungry when I went to bed. Up too late this morning, which meant I was  starving  when I got up, so I didn't feel like I could run like that (most mornings it takes me a bit of time to get hungry).  We'll try M/W/F for a while and see how it goes.  I also think I will repeat Week 1. I'm still barely making it through the 60 second running intervals - I'm not sure I could switch to 90 at this point. Feeling a bit stronger now than I did on Tuesday, but I think I'll have to do the "Remedial Couch to 5K." Oh, well, as long as I'm making progress!  Going skating with Wendy and Doug this afternoon, too. I've paid my penance with running, now I get to have fun with skating. I will stick this running thing out to the 5K, but at some point, it had better start getting more fun!

      No workout today.  I think it's a good thing - my quads are starting to forgive me and will probably be ready for the abuse I will heap upon them this weekend.  Plan to run first thing tomorrow (though probably not at 6 a.m. as I did on Tuesday/Thursday), then will likely get out and blade at least one of the days, preferably both.  Weather's looking very promising for outdoor fun.

       Two 15-minute walks  Energy level: a little low     This afternoon I walked down to Gameworks and back to meet some friends for drinks/food/games.  It's probably a little less than a mile from my office to Gameworks, so it was a nice bit of bonus exercise.    I'm taking tomorrow off. I have plans after work and I think my quads need a break anyway.  We'll see what I end up doing on Saturday - one thing for sure is visiting the Underwater Sports dive fair to sign up for SCUBA lessons for later this year - they discount the price to $99 (normally $179) if you buy during this weekend.

       5 minute warmup     20 minutes run/walk     5 minute cooldown/stretch     Energy level: okay          Another day of  urlLink Couch to 5K  this morning. When does it get fun?     Today's workout (from the C25K site): Brisk five-minute warmup walk. Then alternate 60 seconds of jogging and 90 seconds of walking for a total of 20 minutes.     I wonder if I'm ever going to  love  running or even like it. Everyone who does says "stick with it." And I know that burning lungs and a nice high heart rate are a good thing. I took my pulse after one of the running intervals and it was at about 160, which is about as far as I want to push it. I know it's good for me, but that 20 minutes of running felt longer than 60 minutes of skating did last night. But I also probably accomplished as much in a shorter period of time.     Ugh.  Gotta stick with it :)     I run over at Adams Elementary school, which is just a 3 minute (or so) walk from my house. I circle the two softball fields that are back-to-back. For the most part, it's great - I don't have to get in my car and go somewhere, and the surface is either grass or dirt. There's a few issues though: a couple ankle-swallowing holes (I've learned where they are) and some dog owners who seem to think it's an off-leash area (so I need to watch for "deposits.") Plus, the fields are pure dust right now, so my shoes come back pretty grungy. But otherwise, it's a good place to start though I'm sure I'll get bored and will want to hit Green Lake or the Burke-Gilman at some point.

       60 minutes in-line skating   20 minutes weights/stretching (home)       Hit the Burke-Gilman Trail on my skates again, this time going significantly farther. Started by Fred Meyer again. For now, I'm driving over to the beginning of the trail (about 1.5 miles from my house) because I'm not comfortable enough to handle the stops and the traffic. But once I get better, I'll probably skate down the back roads to get to the trail. Today I went all the way to the I-5 bridge and back.     For now, though, I'm still overthinking the tough spots. I do this whenever I learn new things - my brain takes over when I should let instinct reign. I'll get there. For now, I'm mostly letting gravity and friction stop me - not entirely comfortable with braking. Every road crossing (and there are a few, though most of them don't have much traffic) I was slowing down to go over the curb cuts, when in reality I should probably have just blown right through them as slowing down actually makes it tougher.     But it was a gorgeous night to be out, with a beautiful sunset, and I felt great. I checked my pulse once mid-workout when I stopped to drink a little water, and I was at about 124 bpm, which is about 65% or so of my MHR (depending on which calculator you use), which is about where I want to be for a longer workout like this. For running, I'm probably pushing closer to 70-80%, which is good - I want to use running to push myself more for shorter time periods.

      So things are a little sore this morning.  I think between running and rollerblading, I awakened some long-dormant muscles.  But nothing's so painful that I don't want to get out and do it all over again!

       25 minutes in-line skating Energy level: High!   So back in the summer of 1996, I was living in Manhattan while working at Pfizer on a summer internship. I learned to in-line skate that summer, and spent many a weekend day tooling around Central Park on my skates. I bought a cheap pair of Rollerblades at a Herman's Sporting Goods going-out-of-business sale, and while they were serviceable, they were never quite comfortable.  I skated maybe 2 or 3 more times since then - a couple times in Research Triangle Park when I was back in Durham, and I think once here in Seattle. Needless to say it's been a while.  So tonight I stopped by Gregg's to see what they had to offer. The high school kid (a born salesman - the kid's got a future) talked me into a pair of  urlLink these . By the time I was done there it was after 8, but I had to get out and break them in, so I parked near the Ballard Fred Meyer and hit the  urlLink Burke-Gilman  trail. I still had all my old protective gear from the last time around, and I decided to put it all on - knee, elbow, and wrist guards. Back in NY I only used the wrist guards, but I thought for my first day back, I'd better go with everything then maybe I'd be more confident.  I forgot how much I can book on skates - I was down at the Fremont Bridge before I knew it, and I wasn't even going that fast. Because it was getting dark and I had to pee, that was far enough - it's probably 1 1/2 miles from Fred Meyer to the bridge. I did pretty well - still need to work on the stopping thing, but it was a good time to be out there - relatively uncrowded and the trail is pretty flat and wide and well-paved.  Looking forward to having another fun way to work out. On the way back, I actually pushed a little and got up some speed, which felt great and challenging. I need to get a little more confident with the brakes to really get fast, but for the most part, I felt comfortable today.

       30 minute walk     Went for a 30 minute walk at lunchtime with Steven. We were doing that once or twice a week regularly for a while then between one or the other of us being out of the office, got out of the habit. I'd like to try to do that more often - it's good for the body and good for the soul, especially in the summer. Lots of stuff going on in my head today and it was really nice to just be out in the sun and talk through that. And staring at something other than my monitor is a good thing.

      Yeah, okay, so I was in the shower.  And what better place to start thinking about your body?     When I was doing PT back in November, the first day, Kristi, my physical therapist, said "You're going to do great at rehab - you're lucky - you have a really athletic body." At 50ish lbs heavier than I am now, I just scoffed, saying "Well, it's hidden." She said, "No, no, I can tell you build muscle really easily - not every one can."    Well, I'm starting to get that I do have an athletic body.  Last night at the gym when I was doing pelvic lifts (lying on my back, feet on an exercise ball, lifting pelvis up) I positioned myself a little differently so that the mirror was to my side and I could watch myself through the exercise. And I looked at my calves. I've never been crazy about them because I think they're kinda big (makes buying boots made for little stick-legged girls a pain!), but I realized that they're pretty much all muscle right now. And I kinda dug that. Then I looked at my thighs, which can still use a lot of toning, but I watched my quads work and realized "Wow, they've really come a long way, too, and I can see the muscle instead of fat." There's always been muscle there, but now it's finally starting to show!     I need new running shoes. This I know. Wendy had recommended a store that a friend owns, and I'll probably head up there. I realized that the last time I got fitted for a pair of running shoes was probably 2000 * . I don't know exactly what I weighed then, but suffice it to say it was a lot more, and I started to think "I move completely differently now." So it's possible I shouldn't even be wearing the same shoes any more. So I will be buying new shoes soon and going through a formal fitting process.     Last night I was telling James that I have to eat before I work out, but not too close (at least a half hour, preferably an hour). He said he couldn't eat for 3-4 hours before he worked out. No way I can do that, I said. And it's true that I can't do that for an evening workout. If I try to workout in the late afternoon/early evening several hours after lunch, I have no energy and no stamina. But I guess that's different for me in the morning, because I bounced out of bed and did my workout this morning with no problem. Granted it was a short workout. I'll just have to keep an eye on it and see if some mornings I need to eat something small before I go out.     Anyway, it'll be fun to watch the progress and changes I can make by continuing to work out.      *No, I haven't worn the same pair for four years, I just keep buying the same brand/style/size.

       5 minute warmup    20 minutes run/walk    5 minute cooldown/stretch    Energy level: decent!      So I started  urlLink Couch to 5K  this morning. I tried it once before, but got derailed by a little accident the folks at Harborview's Trauma Center like to call "Ped vs. Car" (I was the ped).     Today's workout (from the C25K site): Brisk five-minute warmup walk. Then alternate 60 seconds of jogging and 90 seconds of walking for a total of 20 minutes.     Things I noticed today? 60 lbs (what I've lost since the last time I tried running) makes a difference. I notice it day-to-day, and I noticed it this morning. I felt lighter on my feet, and my lungs weren't burning quite as much. Last time I tried, I remember I couldn't get through all of the running intervals. Today I did, though the lungs were burning by the end.     I know this program will force me to push myself on the cardio a bit - I don't do that, and therefore, I don't really improve. Part of that's that I've been in some sort of rehab since last September, and the focus is always on gaining strength. Part of it's just that I don't do it. Even the new activity I learned last year (snowboarding) requires more strength (especially those quads/calves) than cardio. Not that it doesn't require endurance, and I'm looking forward to building up my cardio endurance so I can do those really long runs next year (now that I don't fall as much!).     Anyway, W1D1 is over. I think I will go ahead and pick the Dawg Dash 5K in late October, as recommended by  urlLink Karl . That gives me about 14 weeks to complete a 9 week training program. This assumes I will probably end up repeating some weeks (not that I'll take weeks off entirely). If I'm feeling up to an earlier race, I'd definitely run it, but I'm committing to Dawg Dash now.

       25 minutes eliptical  45 minutes lifting/stretching/cooldown  Energy level: high!     Ah!  Back to the gym after at least two weeks off.  I've been a bit slack since shoulder surgery in April.  Not really an excuse since I could still do a lot, but I used it as one.    I was dismissed from PT and given the a-okay from my surgeon on July 7th and 8th, then promptly went on a long weekend trip to New York and came back with the plague.  So my promise to myself to "start working out seriously again" was put on hold while I fought off whatever viral shit I picked up for the next week and a half.  This past weekend was way too hot and I was way too busy, but I said all weekend "MONDAY."    Lucky me, I was bouncing off the walls with energy tonight, a good night to get back into the swing of exercising.  I did my usual gym routine tonight - pushed the pace a bit on the eliptical, and threw in as much of everything else as I could take.  All in all, a good workout.    Tomorrow, I'm going to start the  urlLink Couch to 5K  running plan again.  Now, I tried this back in September 2003, the last time I felt like I was losing focus.  I did it for two days, and promptly got hit by a car.  This time, I'm hoping to be able to stick with it.  In the next few days I'll pick a 5K event some time in the October/November timeframe as a goal.

       30 minutes inline skating Energy level: good   Well, thanks to being stuck on the phone with Qwest (my soon-to-be-former DSL/home phone/wireless provider) for 45 minutes, I didn't get to start skating till about 8:10.  I went as far as Gasworks and back, and by that time it was 8:45.  (I did stop for 5 minutes to chat with Andy, who was out on a run).  I even wore my glasses, but by that point I could barely see.  Just hit home ... summer's coming to a close, slowly but surely.  Where a month ago, 8:45 would have been plenty light, now... it's night.  I'm trying desperately not to think about the idea of summer being over and having to come up with other options for working out.  I'm going to look into some of the classes at my gym, too, particularly yoga, but also some of the other classes as well.

       5 minute warmup 20 minutes run/walk 5 minute cooldown/stretch Energy level: good    Brisk five-minute warmup walk, then do two repetitions of the following: 		     Jog 200 yards (or 90 seconds)  .  Walk 200 yards (or 90 seconds).    Jog 400 yards (or 3 minutes).    Walk 400 yards (or three minutes).   Finally I did a full Week 3 workout for  urlLink Couch-to-5K . I got through that nagging second 3-minute running interval. Woo hoo! I'll do it again on Saturday, and assuming that goes well, I'll attempt Week 4 next week. I think Week 4's going to take a while, too.   It looks pretty brutal:   Brisk five-minute warmup walk, then: 		      Jog 1/4 mile (or 3 minutes)    Walk 1/8 mile (or 90 seconds)    Jog 1/2 mile (or 5 minutes)    Walk 1/4 mile (or 2-1/2 minutes)    Jog 1/4 mile (or 3 minutes)    Walk 1/8 mile (or 90 seconds)    Jog 1/2 mile (or 5 minutes)     I did poke around the Coolrunning discussion boards and while there are some people who can do C25K in 9 weeks, there seem to be quite a number who repeat weeks. I'll get there... eventually.

       20 minutes elliptical 45 minutes strength training/stretching   There must be something about Wednesday as "bad body image day." I got all up in it again at the gym tonight - hating the way my track pants fit, focusing in on the areas I hate - my upper arms, my thighs, and (ugh) my stomach. Focusing in on the sad reality that in certain places on my body, no matter how hard I work to lose weight and tone, I may have done irreparable damage to my body by carrying around all that extra weight for so long.  I've always thought cosmetic surgery was impossibly vain (or at the very least, an external fix for internal problems). I've always maintained that plastic surgery was justifiable only in cases where someone's been disfigured or injured. But this has gotten me to thinking? Have I disfigured my own body to the point where I can justify plastic surgery to myself?  It's not something I'll think seriously about until at least a year after I've reached my goal weight. Everything I've read says that you need to wait that long to see how your skin springs back. But it's something I wonder about.  It's definitely the vanity that's driving these body image issues. It's my desire to feel beautiful, to feel attractive, to be validated for my body. I suppose not being single would help that, but I also know that I need to find that peace with my own body. I'm not sure how to get there on the pure "looking in the mirror" side of things.  I can focus on what I can do with my body that I couldn't 18 months ago. Tonight, Carrie, who works at the gym, asked me if I was planning to snowboard again this year. I said "Heck yeah!" She said "Set up some time with me and I'll put together a training program for you to get you ready." She's also trying to get a ski and snowboard conditioning class added to the schedule at the gym. Snowboarding. Yeah, that's something I couldn't have done.  On Saturday, after I got back from skydiving, Parker asked me "A year ago, would you have pictured yourself doing this?" A year ago I might have hoped I could, but no, I definitely wouldn't have been able to. Not only because at the time I was over the weight limit, but because I wouldn't have had the confidence in my own body.  "A year ago" is an interesting time to think about, because my accident was almost exactly a year ago. I got to thinking at the gym today - I should do something big to mark the occasion. Celebrate the fact that despite the long road back, I'm fully, 100%  back , weird-ass leg scars and all. My body was bruised and battered, but not broken. On September 5, 2003, I couldn't even stand, let alone skydive, so I'm thinking I need to schedule a dive for September 5, 2004. It' s the Sunday of Labor Day weekend, and I was thinking of taking advantage of that weekend to get some of my dives in anyway.  Maybe I'll make a really huge deal of it and invite some friends to come out and see me dive then get lunch or something in Snohomish. Make a toast to survivors!  So I'll try to focus on that. I'll try to focus on all the things I can do with my body, and all the power it gives me. It's hard to do that though, when what I really crave is validation that it is an attractive body. I know most of that has to come from inside... I can't wait around to get it from others (though, damn, it would be nice to be objectified!).

       50 minutes inline skating Energy level: good   So after Francesca and I skated on Sunday, she mentioned that for some reason her left side hurt a bit more. Of course, after the first time I went skating, I rediscovered new muscles, too. But I realized my left leg felt a bit tighter than my right as well. I wondered whether it was because my left leg is the one that was injured and will probably always be a bit screwy, or whether there was something I was doing.  As I fiddled with my boots trying to get both skates feeling comfortable and stable at the same time I thought perhaps the boot fit was contributing. But then I looked at how I was skating and realized that I definitely favor the left side. I tend to push off harder from the left and coast a little more with the right. So for the second part of my skate tonight I tried to pay more attention to pushing hard from the right. We'll see if that affects things.  I also haven't been very good about stretching after skating, which isn't good. I always stretch at the gym, and I always stretch after I run. Skating shouldn't be any different.  Taking last night off was the right decision. I woke up feeling much better mentally and physically today. I need to find that balance between not cutting myself too much slack and getting lazy and listening to my body when it says "no mas!"

      Today I talked to the wonderful folks at  urlLink Skydive Snohomish  and signed up for five (count 'em, five) jumps this weekend. I'm doing jumps 2-4 in the  urlLink static line progression  on Saturday, and jumps 5 and 6 on Sunday. The first jump will basically be a repeat of what I did last Saturday, then they've scheduled in a break for me where I'll eat some lunch and work on reading the manual a bit, then I'll do two more back to back.  CJ, who was my instructor last weekend, was the one who called me back to schedule the dives. She confirmed that everyone from my class on Saturday was able to successfully dive, though some provided her with more humor than others!  She said they don't normally recommend more than three dives a day at this point - otherwise it becomes too mentally and physically taxing. There's a lot of stuff to learn and a lot of new information to take in, and the last thing you want is a brain fart just because you're overwhelmed.  The full progression to get licensed is approximately 25 jumps. If you go longer than 30 days between jumps, you have to start over from scratch, and that gets expensive and time-consuming. So I had to decide whether I wanted to do this, and now that I've decided that I do, I might as well get in as many as I can while the weather is still good. Labor Day weekend might be a chance to get some more in as well - I'll check the Bumbershoot lineup and schedule around it.

      I had to do it. My whole body was saying "hell no" and I had to listen. It wasn't that any particular part of my body hurt, I'm just sluggy. Have been sluggy all day. I walked around downtown after work - probably 2+ miles - doing some shopping. I kept waiting for my energy to kick up a notch and it didn't. Got home around 7:30, cooked dinner, and gave myself permission not to go to the gym tonight. I ran this morning, and will do something (skating?) after work tomorrow.  While I was shopping I got to thinking about sizes. Clothing sizes in particular, and how they relate to how I see my body. I still have trouble picking something off a rack and looking at it and figuring out if it's likely to fit. I'm off in either direction. Part of that is that womens' clothing sizes are just damned screwy - at the moment I have clothes in at least three different sizes that fit perfectly, so I can't just say "oh, I wear [whatever] size" and know it will fit.  In June, I went to the Fremont Fair and saw an adorable skirt in one of the booths. I looked to see what sizes they had, and they had an XL, a M, a S, and a XS. I held the XL up and thought "this is probably too big" and pulled it on over my shorts and confirmed "yup, it's way too big." I asked the women working the booth if they had a L in back. One woman said "Nope, everything is out. " I said, "oh well, that's too bad, I really liked it." The woman said "Try a Medium." I said "No way in hell do I wear a Medium." She said "Our sizes run a little big - you can probably wear it." I said "Ha! I don't think so." She pointed at the other woman working the booth and said "She wears a Medium in our clothes."  Funny thing was, that didn't help me. I couldn't look at her and think "Oh, okay, I'm about the same size. " I had no concept. I pulled the Medium off the rack, looked at it and thought "way too small." But, skeptically, I went into the dressing room, pulled my shorts off and tried the skirt on. It fit. Perfectly.  After I'd worn the skirt, I hung it back on a hanger, and looked at it, and suddenly it looked huge.  Perception is such a weird thing.

Walk 200 yards (or 90 seconds).    Jog 400 yards (or 3 minutes).    Walk 400 yards (or three minutes).   So I'm still working on Week 3 of  urlLink Couch-to-5K . I inched a little closer today - I got to 2:40 on the second 3-minute running interval. I also noticed that the recovery time for the 90 second intervals and the first 3-minute interval seemed faster today (though I didn't verify that by actually taking my heart rate).  If I do actually get through the Week 3 intervals this week, I peeked ahead to Week 4 and shuddered. And Week 5 is an even bigger leap. I'm starting to confirm this isn't a realistic plan for me to complete in 9 weeks. It makes me wonder: how many people *do* find this a realistic plan? I should pop around the Cool Running discussion boards a little more and see.  Edit: I checked the boards and found  urlLink this  thread (among many others).  I need to hang out there more :)

       1 hour 15 minutes inline skating Energy level: good till the end then a bit sluggy   Dragged Francesca out on skates today for the first time in a while (and only her third time ever, I think). I skated from Fred Meyer to Gasworks to meet Francesca at Urban Surf, but it turns out they don't rent skates any more. So we hopped into her car to run up to Gregg's at Greenlake to rent her skates, then drove back down to Gasworks to skate on the Burke-Gilman (far too many obstacles at Green Lake for either of us).  We went from there down to the UW campus, then back up to Stone Way, then back up almost to the I-5 bridge and back to Stone Way. We split off then and she went back to her car and I went back to Fred Meyer. I'm too lazy to do the math to figure out how far that is, but it's probably about 9 miles or so for me.

      Well, I kept this kind of quiet - only told a few people I was going out. I'm not sure why, but I guess I wanted to just do it, not make a huge deal out of it, see if I could pull it off, and THEN report on it. I've been talking about doing this for a LONG time, but unfortunately, for a long time I was over the weight limit of 250 lbs. Not anymore, so I officially had no more excuses.  So, without further ado... yes, it's true, I jumped out of a perfectly good airplane today and I can't wait to do it again!     It was great. It was everything I'd expected and nothing like what I expected. I signed up on Monday, which didn't give me an awful lot of time to overthink it. I decided I just might like this, and if I wanted to continue to getting fully licensed, it made more sense to start with the static line jump. Of course, that means no "safety net" of an instructor strapped to you. Yes, if everything goes right, the chute is pulled for you by the static line, which is attached to the plane. If everything goes wrong, you're the only one who can pull that reserve chute.  You still have to steer and pilot the chute to the ground all by yourself. You're being talked down by an instructor via radio, but ultimately, you have to know what to do and be able to get yourself down. It's possible the radio will fail and you have to get yourself down.  That's basically what you spend almost 5 hours going over before you can jump. There were 15 students in my class and we spent quite a bit of time in the classroom learning about how the chutes work, jump procedures, emergency procedures, etc. CJ, our instructor, was a lot of fun and she made the class entertaining, but still very seriously discussed all the safety issues. We practiced getting in and out of the plane. We practiced reacting to various emergency scenarios. We practiced falling. Jumping and falling. More falling.  So after spending the better part of the day learning about all the things that can possibly go wrong, it's time to take a leap of faith (and as an interesting aside, I was encouraged by the fact that the song that was playing on my clock radio when I got up this morning was an old favorite - John Hiatt's  Have a Little Faith in Me ). They divided our class in to five "loads" of three students. Since I signed up pretty late, I was supposed to be in the last load, but they rearranged a bit to accommodate some groups. Since I was one of the "singles" I was put in with two out of a group of five. They'd reserved early, so I was in the very first load. I was placed so I was the very first diver, too. Eek!  I think that was the best way to do it because it meant I didn't have much time at all after the end of class to overthink it. I just had to get ready, and go. My diving partners were Cody and Marissa, who were visiting from Spokane with Marissa's sisters and a friend from Seattle. The planes are so tiny, you pretty much have to make friends. There's the pilot's seat, and space for the instructor. Jumper 3 (last one out) squeezes in behind the pilot with legs facing back. In our plane, that was Marissa. Jumper 2 (Cody) sits in the back of the plane with legs facing forward. Jumper 1 (me) sits in between Jumper 2's legs with legs facing forward. And that, literally, takes up every inch of space in the plane.  Once you reach altitude, CJ opens the door of the plane, then tells you to slide towards the edge of the plane. At that point, you put your feet out on a platform on the wheel, and get ready to grab the wing strut. Sounds easy, right? Well, in addition to the psychological barrier of climbing out on a freaking WING STRUT, you also have to fight winds, so it takes all your strength. Which, as it turned out, made it easier for me. I was so focused on the energy it took to do that, I didn't really have time to psych myself out. So you hold on to the wing strut, move your hands far out the strut, and CJ says "step off and hang." Once you do that, it's seconds till you're gone. If that.  So then you're falling. It's not for very long, and I forgot just about everything - you're supposed to arch your back and spread your legs and arms out. I didn't even think about it, just the fact that holy shit I just let go of a plane. From then, it's only about 5 seconds till your chute inflates. I managed to realize a couple seconds in that I needed to be arching, and fortunately, your body kind of naturally goes in that position anyway.  I got through that, got my wits about me enough to look up and realize my canopy had opened perfectly. I got the steering lines from above my head, did a couple test "pumps" of the lines, and then said to myself "Oh my god I'm skydiving" and had a quick look around.  I got my first instructions on the radio, did a few test turns, then he told me to just settle in and enjoy the view. So I did. I noticed Mt. Baker was out, which was absolutely spectacular. I got the lay of the land. I played around a bit with the chute, just to get a feel for how it moved.  The five minutes it takes was over pretty quickly. Before I knew it I was approaching the field. Steve, the "talk-down" instructor, guided me through a nice, soft landing. I didn't stick it perfectly - I fell forward onto my knees a bit, but didn't hurt anything or break anything, so I was pretty happy.  I can't wait to go out again - I will probably schedule a couple of jumps for next weekend - I'm just going to jump (pun intended) into the  urlLink static line progression  at Skydive Snohomish and see how far I can get. You need to keep jumping regularly to get fully licensed - if you go too long you have to repeat the basic class, which is both expensive and time-consuming.  No photos yet, but Marissa had a disposable camera and was kind enough to get photos of me, too, which she's promised to mail to me. There's one of me sitting in the plane ready to go, and one of me standing out on the wheel holding on to the wing strut, ready to go. I'm looking forward to seeing them!

       5 minute warmup 20 minutes run/walk 5 minute cooldown/stretch Energy level: good    Brisk five-minute warmup walk, then do two repetitions of the following: 		     Jog 200 yards (or 90 seconds)  .  Walk 200 yards (or 90 seconds).    Jog 400 yards (or 3 minutes).    Walk 400 yards (or three minutes).   Once again, it's that last running interval that gets me.  It's official, I'm repeating Week 3 next week.  Ordinarily, I wouldn't run two mornings in a row. But because of a super-early meeting on Wednesday, I didn't get up to run then, so I ran yesterday. I have early plans tomorrow morning, too, and tried my best to talk myself out of running at all the rest of the week. Here's a snippet from a little IM conversation last night that shows how hard I tried! Fortunately, as you can see, the angel on my shoulder got some extra help.  Editor's note: IM typos left in for authenticity  :)  [22:45] KrisanneCombs: trying to decide whether i feel like getting up early enough to run either today or saturday [22:45] KrisanneCombs: (i mean tomorrow or saturday) [22:45] cpsigsegv11: do it tomorrow [22:45] cpsigsegv11: then you can enjoy sat morning [22:45] cpsigsegv11: :) [22:46] KrisanneCombs: yeah but i don't want to get up tomorrow [22:46] KrisanneCombs: :( [22:49] cpsigsegv11: well, then you have to getup saturday [22:49] KrisanneCombs: damn [22:50] KrisanneCombs: there's no way around it, is there?

      So last night when I was in my body image funk, I got into this mindset of "I've lost 125 lbs and I'M STILL FAT." Some days I get like that and I can't put it into perspective. I still have 50 lbs to lose and they seem like the biggest 50 lbs out there, because they're between me and what will probably be my ultimate goal weight (I say "probably" because, never having been a "normal weight" as an adult, I'm just guessing based on height/weight charts and my frame size).    Perspective:    I have friends who weigh 125.  I've lost a whole person.    Perspective:   These  urlLink jeans  were getting tight when I started. Yes, I have both legs in one leg of the jeans. As was this  urlLink jacket . More  urlLink jeans . More  urlLink jacket .  Please excuse the post-running grunginess. :)    Perspective:   I'm 70% of the way to my goal.  It's so hard because some days I don't see it and some days I want to say "why bother, I'm always going to be fat." I know in my head that's not true, but it's hard to remember sometimes. I ended up chatting with Parker last night about that issue, and it was nice to hear that he understood that feeling and has had it before in the past (though with photos like  urlLink this , I hope not recently!). But it's nice to talk with someone else who's made drastic changes in their weight/health/fitness to know that the unmotivated, crappy body image days are normal.  Then there's the questions. The questions can depress me when I'm in the wrong mood, even though they generally come from a good place and I appreciate the encouragement.    "What's Up with Couch to 5K?"    Eric was asking about Couch to 5K the other day, and I was telling him where I was in the program this week. I started thinking "he's a runner, he probably thinks not being able to run 3 minutes is ridiculous." But then I reminded myself "He's a runner who has been doing it for several years and also took a while to build up to where he is now." He's also not carrying around 50 extra pounds. I've never been much of a runner. Even as a kid, when I used to play soccer and basketball and generally be really active, I remember the 600 yard run in the Presidential Physical Fitness test being a struggle. I thought about that this morning - I seem to remember 2 1/2 minutes was the time you had to get to "pass" the President's test with the high score. I thought "I'm running 3 minutes and I only remember passing that test once when I was a kid." So hey, at least I'm back to that level of fitness.    "Are you still doing Atkins?"   This one gets me every time. I want to say "Do you not GET IT? This is the way I eat now. Even if I never lose another pound, this is the way I eat now." But I know where it comes from. Atkins and other low-carb plans have such a reputation as "fad diets" and are used as quick fixes so many times, that people find it difficult to understand when someone chooses to make it a total lifestyle change. Well, I have. There may be days (like last weekend) when I don't make the best choices, but every day for the rest of my life, I will make the choice to eat this way. I eventually will move into lifelong maintenance and eat less restrictively, but I'll never go back to the days where my four major food groups were sugar, pasta, rice, and flour. I can't. I can't go back to being on the sugar roller-coaster, which I firmly believe was the source of my lifelong struggles with depression.    "Are you still losing weight?"   I get this one and I realize I'm a victim of my own success to some extent. I get asked this question all the time, by a bunch of different people. Eric asks me the question regularly and it seems he can't understand why I wouldn't continue to lose weight at a regular pace. And I'm not angry at him - I know he's trying to be supportive and has been throughout this whole thing. I think it really is that he doesn't relate - he's someone who is blessed with a high metabolism in general, who is a guy (and thus is missing those damn baby-making genes!), and who has never struggled with his weight.  When I started on Atkins, I posted regularly on a low-carb online bulletin board. I would read stories of people whose weight loss slowed or even stalled, even though they followed their plans to the letter. I thought "That won't happen to me." And for a long time, it didn't. But now? I don't really understand how my body works. I think this last 50 lbs will take as long as the first 125 did to lose. They will be more difficult to lose. I will probably go weeks without dropping weight. I will probably continue to bounce up and down by a pound or three here and there (which is normal - as long as the general trend is downward or flat, I'm happy). I'll play around with things - right now I'm trying to kick the exercise up a notch. I don't know when/if I'm going to see a direct impact on the scale from that, but I sure as hell feel better.  Fact is, as easy as I've made it look over the last 18 months, losing weight is hard. Once I got the behavior/lifestyle modifications down, it really  was  easy to drop the weight. The first 100 lbs came off so fast it surprised even me. The last 25 have been much more hard-won. The next 50 will probably drive me nuts.  The good news? I know how to successfully maintain my weight loss. I've NEVER been able to do that. EVER. If I never lose another pound, that's a good thing.  But damn, I just know this is going to be a day to day battle with my own demons. I hope eventually they go away, but I know they probably won't. I just have to keep them at bay. For good.  And now, I'm running late...  [EDIT] I thought of one more thing on the "victim of my own success" thing. I often find myself wondering if, when my weight loss slows down, people wonder "Is she slipping? Is she cheating?" or "Here we go again." Because, frankly, it's been a pattern through my whole life - I can lose weight but I can't keep it off. What I think I can't explain (and maybe it's because I don't fully understand  why) , is that this really is different. I've never had control before. I've never felt like I'd made a permanent change. This time, I do. 18 months is a short time in the grand scheme of things, but in the realm of lifestyle change and making behavioral modifications, it's a pretty decent length of time. And it is  by far  the longest stretch I've ever experienced.

       5 minute warmup 20 minutes run/walk 5 minute cooldown/stretch Energy level: good   Well, didn't  quite make it through Week 3, Day 2, either.  Here's what the site says I'm supposed to do:   Brisk five-minute warmup walk, then do two repetitions of the following: 		     Jog 200 yards (or 90 seconds)  .  Walk 200 yards (or 90 seconds).    Jog 400 yards (or 3 minutes).    Walk 400 yards (or three minutes).     Once again, I made it almost all the way through the second 3-minute running interval - about 2:20.  Keep trying till I get it. Ugh! If it's not the lungs, it's the legs - today they were feeling sluggy. I'm off schedule this week because of an early meeting yesterday, but I think that skating in the evening and running in the morning might not be the way to do it if I can avoid it. Plus I need new shoes. Must go get new shoes.

       50 minutes inline skating Energy level: crappy at start, good by the end   Almost talked myself into sitting on the couch and watching the Mariners game tonight but I went out anyway.  Glad I did - though I got started so late it was pretty dark by the time I was done.  Having a bad body image day.  Don't know why.  Almost feeling like "fuck it, why bother" but I know better than to get caught up in that.

              	          	        44 minutes inline skating Energy level: high!   Today I went out and consciously decided to kick it up a notch on the skating. I felt like I was pushing harder, and my heart rate definitely reflected it, but overall didn't end up shaving that much time off. This puts me up to an average speed of 7.6 mph, which is at least getting me closer to the Rollerblade "minimum" speed of 8 mph. I wonder who these people are who can go 15 mph on skates! I think I probably need to work on my technique to really go a lot faster - I probably need to lean over more and push off more to get a consistently fast stride going.  Probably won't run tomorrow morning - I have to be down at our Tukwila facility by 7:30 for a vendor visit that lasts till 2:30. I figure I can "work from home" after that, so maybe after it cools off I'll squeeze the run in. Either that, or I'll do it Thursday morning.

       20 minutes stationary bike 50 minutes strength/core/stretching Energy level: good   Worked out at the gym tonight.  Went out for a drink after work and by the time I got home it was 7:45 and I was starving.  Ate really quickly and by that point it was too dark to skate, so I did the gym instead.  It was damn hot today, so the gym wasn't the best place to be, but oh well.  I'll try to get some skating in tomorrow night.

       5 minute warmup 20 minutes run/walk 5 minute cooldown/stretch Energy level: good   Well, didn't  quite make it through Week 3, Day 1.  Here's what the site says I'm supposed to do:   Brisk five-minute warmup walk, then do two repetitions of the following: 		       Jog 200 yards (or 90 seconds)    Walk 200 yards (or 90 seconds)    Jog 400 yards (or 3 minutes)    Walk 400 yards (or three minutes)     I made it almost all the way through the second 3-minute running interval - about 2:15. I substituted walking, but I need to get all the way to 3 minutes before I move on. I'll just keep trying it every morning till I can get it. Then I'll move on. So I may or may not repeat weeks - I'll just keep trying to stretch it.  Largely sluggy weekend - went up to Vancouver, didn't eat all that well and didn't exercise (except running on Saturday). The way I ate this weekend was practically the equivalent of mainlining carbs for me - I can't do that and expect to continue to meet my weight goals. The scale reflected it this morning, so I need to go back to very very strict low-carb for a bit to shake things up. Ugh. Just goes to show that after 18 months of doing this, I still need to make good decisions  every single day .  I get on autopilot and I think I can handle it, and it's a slippery slope to making bad choices again.

       5 minute warmup 20 minutes run/walk 5 minute cooldown/stretch Energy level: good   From the C25K site: Brisk five-minute warmup walk. Then alternate 90 seconds of jogging and two minutes of walking for a total of 20 minutes.  Another week down.   Legs were a bit sluggy today - not really in pain but just... sluggy.  Next week's C25K intimidates me a little bit:   Brisk five-minute warmup walk, then do two repetitions of the following: 		      Jog 200 yards (or 90 seconds)    Walk 200 yards (or 90 seconds)    Jog 400 yards (or 3 minutes)    Walk 400 yards (or three minutes)     But hey, last week I didn't think I could bump up to 90 seconds, so I'll give it a shot.  All I can do is try, I suppose.

      So the devil on my shoulder won out this morning  when it was raining pretty heavily at 6 when the alarm went off.  Drizzle  is one thing, rain's entirely another.  It's supposed to clear tomorrow, so  I will get out and fit in W2D3 tomorrow morning (must remember not to stay up  ridiculously late tonight).  Does make me wonder how I'm going to handle  this once fall kicks in.  I guess I'll just have to see.  By then I'll  be more comfortable running in front of other people, so I can use the  treadmills at the gym.  And most days, it's just drizzle, so I just need to  make sure I have the right gear to handle it.  I switched to M/W/F so that I wouldn't necessarily have to get up on Saturday mornings to run, but I guess in a way it's nice to have Saturday as a backup.  I don't want to get into the habit, but on mornings like this, it's nice to be able to say "hell no."

       5o minutes inline skating Energy level: decent   Well, originally I'd planned to go skating out at Alki with Kim, but she got stuck at work trying to finish some last minute prjoects before she takes the day off tomorrow. So, I came home and had to self-motivate to do Burke-Gilman. I managed to talk myself into it and to talk myself into doing the whole distance from Fred Meyer to the I-5 bridge, which I'm doing a bit faster - I think I slow down less at street crossings now.  Finally found a trail map - it looks like that distance is 2.8 miles, so I'm covering 5.6 miles in a little over 50 minutes, so going about 6.5 miles per hour. I poked around the Rollerblade site to find this  urlLink chart on calories burned  - so apparently I'm going pretty slow!  But I'm getting more comfortable and hoping that will let me go faster at some point.

       30 minutes elipitical 50 minutes strength/core/stretching Energy level: good   I realized tonight that I'm not really getting my heart rate up when I do the eliptical any more.  I could up the resistance, which I did, but I may have to start thinking about doing something different for cardio at the gym.  I suppose once it gets colder, I'll want to do my running inside on a treadmill, so maybe that will be it.  I've never really been fond of the stairmaster, and exercise bikes don't get my heart rate up enough, either.  Maybe I'll have to play around with some settings on those to challenge myself a bit.

       5 minute warmup 20 minutes run/walk 5 minute cooldown/stretch Energy level: good   From the C25K site: Brisk five-minute warmup walk. Then alternate 90 seconds of jogging and two minutes of walking for a total of 20 minutes.  So today was the first time I had to work  really  hard to talk myself into getting up to run.  Angel Krisanne: The alarm went off.  Get up. Devil Krisanne: That was just the first one.  Hit snooze. AK: Okay  10 minutes later  AK: It went off again. DK: Hit snooze again.  10 minutes later  AK: Okay, this time we really have to get up. DK: But I don't wanna! AK: Yes, yes you do. DK: What would be so bad if I didn't? AK: You'd be behind. DK: I could run Thursday and Saturday AK: You know you won't do that. DK: I could run tonight! AK: You  really  know you won't do that. DK: But we're already 15 minutes late and there's the big meeting this morning. AK: And the meeting's not till 10:30!  Not an excuse.  And we'll feel better if we run. DK: Grumblegrumblegrumbleokay.  So before I went out I decided to take a motivational picture in my newest gear. Granted, taking a picture in black probably isn't the best move - as black is pretty flattering and spandex sucks EVERYTHING in, but it'll give me a rough idea of the baseline here (and this is one of the most ... umm... supportive tops I've owned.  Damn it makes me look flat-chested!). These days the changes are more subtle, so I'm hoping I can compare photos a few months from now and at least see some difference. I took a front and side photo because one of my biggest regrets is how few side photos I have from before I started losing weight, and I think that's where the difference really shows up. Please ignore the bedhead :)           I noticed that my recovery time felt a little faster today. My heart rate immediately after the running interval was about 156-164, at the end of the walking interval it was down to 128-136. I played a little game to get through the running intervals - trying to guess exactly where I would end up at 90 seconds. It'll be an interesting informal way to tell if I'm getting any faster as I progress.

       25 minutes elipitical 50 minutes strength/core/stretching Energy level: decent   There's something about going to the gym in summer that seems so wrong, but I really do need to continue to do weightlifting.  I have to continue building strength in my shoulder, and building strength and muscle overall.  Switching my morning runs to M/W/F will probably mean that I have more two-a-day workouts, which I suppose is really no different than going to the gym one night and running the next morning, but then it also means I'll have off days, like tomorrow.

       5 minute warmup 20 minutes run/walk 5 minute cooldown/stretch Energy level: high!   Well, I decided to do it - go ahead and try Week 2 of  urlLink Couch to 5K . And it wasn't that bad. I was able to do the 90 second running intervals without much more difficulty than the 60 second intervals. I think the longer recovery time helps, too. I guess I just need to take this one week at a time and not spend too much energy anticipating the next week. I figure each Monday I'll try the next step. If it's not making sense, I'll repeat a week.  I need to read up on Cool Running and elsewhere on breathing and stride. I've just been kind of going out there and doing what comes naturally, which is probably okay (since I have a tendency to overthink) but there's probably some minor things I need to think about.  Ah, and  urlLink here's  a good article!  On Saturday I picked up a cheap watch at Fred Meyer with a stopwatch feature and a fabric band. What a difference that made to not be squinting at the minute hand on my regular watch! I suppose eventually I might want some high-tech toy that measures heart rate and the like, but I'm trying really hard not to get caught up in the gearhead mentality of my amateur triathlete buddies (Karl, Francesca, Parker, yes, I'm looking at you guys!). Or at least not on running, which ought to be the least gear-intensive of the new things I'm trying!

       55 minutes in-line skating energy level: okay   This evening's skate was not quite as energetic as yesterday's. I went out by myself, and I think I realized how beneficial it is to have someone else who will keep the pace up - it was very easy to get a little slow by myself. Not that Doug and Wendy were pushing things yesterday, but with three people you just tend to keep moving.  I drove to Gas Works Park tonight and went from there to near University Village. I could maybe have gone a little farther, but that would have involved crossing 25th, which is a really wide, busy street (though there is a light). Although I liked this route, there's several road crossings with meaningful traffic, including two with traffic lights. I don't know if I should be doing them till I'm more comfortable with braking. Especially since they seem to come at the bottom of tiny hills, which is when I'm least comfortable stopping. I did practice braking today, but still need work before I'm comfortable stopping when I absolutely  have  to stop.  The other thing about this route is that though it goes right through the UW campus, there was an appalling lack of shirtless college boys. I guess it is the summer break, though. :)

      Wow, does my wallet hurt.  I just dropped $515 on Scuba lessons and gear.  And that's just the basic stuff: snorkel, mask, fins (the biggest chunk of that money), booties, and gloves.  I start the lessons in late September - the classroom and pool sessions are Tuesday and Thursday nights for two weeks, then the open water dives are both days on the following weekend.  Underwater Sports had their big Divers Fair this weekend, so everything (including the lessons) was on sale, but wow, this could be an expensive hobby!  I've heard that Puget Sound has some of the best diving around, but the cold is also legendary.  The plan is to get PADI certified before I go to New Zealand in November.  Should be fun, at any rate, and it's yet another cool new thing to try.  I guess if I'm going to get seriously into diving around here I'll eventually need a dry suit, but I'm going to let my credit card recover for a while!  Everything else I need for the class (wetsuit, tank, regulator, etc.) will be provided by the class.
