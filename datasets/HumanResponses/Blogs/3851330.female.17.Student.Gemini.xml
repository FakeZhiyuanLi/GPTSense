           Just when you’re trying to forget someone, that’s also the time you dream of them everyday & in your dream, you had a great time with that special someone. How can you move on if they are always in your dream? It just makes you fall for them even more.       Sometimes in your life, you find a special person who changes your life just being a part of it. They made you believe that there really is good in the world. When you are in love, there’s someone in the past that you have loved before but left you for someone else, coming back to you. But the one you are in love has already let you & he may be in love with someone else… Why are these things happening to you? You we’re happy before you meet them, when you get to know them, you we’re happier but then they will just leave you without knowing what’s real reason of doing that. Why did you meet them if they will just hurt you in the end? They like to fall in love, but they let the love pass, by loving with their mind, not with their heart. How can you possibly say it's over when you're still in love with the person you said you were over with already? I guess it's not that easy when the chain of the past locks you in the chest of false hopes. How pathetic but, admit it or not, it's true… The hardest part of losing a loved one is to accept the fact that they're gone and might never come back again. Who didn't like the lines from the movie "Runaway Bride" where Julia Roberts told Richard Gere, "I guarantee that we'll have tough time; I guarantee that in some point, one of us would want to get out; I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret this for the rest of my life, 'coz I know in my heart… you're the only one for me." We tend to think that the person who left us will come back one day and say those words or just simple words but would promise forever. Problems may occur every now and then, but we would consider those things as trials to be conquered in order for the relationship to bloom and mature.       The fear of trusting and falling in love again may also hinder us to grow and move on. We are hesitant to take the risk, afraid that we may get hurt again. Because of the negative thoughts stocked in our brains, we refuse to go out from our self-made world and deprive ourselves from new opportunities, whether in love affairs or career wise. Betrayal can be anywhere and anyone can be a victim. The worst part is when the one we truly, madly and deeply love is the one who will betray us in the end. Then we are left with nothing but a broken heart and wounded pride. Sad… but true.  Learn and live. Love is the most wonderful thing one can offer, so be smart enough to give the love in your heart to the one who really deserves it.       The one that got away from you is that person with who everything was great, everything was perfect, but the timing was just wrong.  The most important & most critical component in successful loving is commitment, not love. It’s easy to love without commitment. People do it all the time. Easy to love, to give of oneself for a while. But commitment implies bonding in such a way that one promises to keep the fires of love burning indefinitely. It also means shutting one's heart to the possibility of loving another who might even be more attractive, even more lovable. Not easy. This is why solid commitments are not at all as common as we are led to believe. In fact, more often than not, I think that the commitment two lovers make are not equal. What I mean is that the commitment of one might be a whole lot more or a whole lot less than the partner's. We see it all the time. One loves more than the other and is more committed than the other. We have often seen lopsided love relationships where one partner is giving so much more to the relationship than the other. Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift. Giving all your love to them is never an assurance that they’ll love you back. Don’t expect love in return, just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn’t, be content it grew in yours. Don’t forget that love comes if you still hope although you have been disappointed; if you still believe although you’ve been betrayed; we still love although you’ve been hurt before. It maybe just trials given to us to make us stronger.
