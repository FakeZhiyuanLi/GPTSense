      Hello everyone...or the one person who is reading this.  As you can see, Mireille was so kind to give me a subdomain of her site,  urlLink holybeaver.com .  To keep her happy, go there now.  So, now, since it's almost summer, and all I'll be doing all day is sitting around in front of the computer or going to the pool, I might as well do something to keep me busy.  I'm not sure how often I will update, but once school is over, I'll have a better idea.  So, it's past my bed time and I have to wake up early for school tomorrow...and I still have homework to do.  I...think I should go.  Tootles!

      Hehe. I just took this quiz thingy, "Which Lesser Harry Potter Character Are You?"     urlLink      urlLink ...and which lesser Harry Potter character are  you ?     Ya ... Parvati Patil. Popular and cute?? Hahahaha no. I'm not popular. I'm ... average, I guess. As for cute, I don't think so, but you can decide for yourself.

      The last week or two of June is always boring. School is over, but summer activities haven't really started yet. This is the part of the summer where I sleep in till 1 in the afternoon and do nothing all day. The only remotely interesting thing that's happened in the past week is that yesterday I got my hair cut. I got 4 inches taken off and I also got it a lot more layered than it was before ... the shortest layer is up to my chin! It's a nice change, especially since the hair dresser blow dried it SO nicely and it's all nice and straight and pretty. It's too bad that I'll have to take a shower soon and ruin it! Meh.   I'll be going up north either tomorrow or Thursday, still unsure, so I'll finally have something to do. I'll have my cousin Dana and my grandparents to keep me busy! There's also more to do up north during this particular part of summer. I mean there's a lake. And there's boats. Unless we get terrible weather the whole time, I don't think I'll be able to stay inside!

      Eek! I got my report card today!! I was so worried that I did worse than I did in 3rd term (an 87), that when I opened up the white envelope with my name on it, I was very relieved to see under "over-all mark" a 90! But for fourth term I got 91. So that's even better.   I spent yesterday and today scanning all of the 90-something pictures that I took when I was in New York. I used up four cameras (hehe) but I threw a bunch of pictures away because they turned out bad. Here's a picture of everyone who was on that trip:

      Ok, sorry that I didn't update on Sunday like I said I would. Anyways, I had a lot of fun on the New York Trip. We went to NBC Studios, Radio City Music Hall, the Empire State Building, Central Park, we went on a boat tour, a bus tour, and a walking tour that wasn't really a walking tour...we just followed the old hippie mutant (see two posts below) around in a big circle through Times Square. We also saw the play "Little Shop of Horrors." That was by far the coolest play I've ever seen. I saw that play once before at John Abbott College, and it was very good, but when I went to see it on Broadway, it was 100 times more amazingly good.   The main bad thing about the trip was that we ate breakfast at McDonalds every morning, for four days. The first three days I had pancakes because there was nothing else that I wanted that looked good, and then on the last day I realized that they had this fruit and yogurt thing. I was like "WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME THIS BEFORE???" It was very yummy.  I find that all the people in New York who served us, like waiters and stuff, were SO much nicer than here in Montreal!! They were so polite, and they all called me "sweetie". But there are a lot of people in New York who are evil. We went to see a baseball game at the Shea Stadium (Mets vs. Indians) and since it was raining, me and my friends moved up under the balcony and we sat next to this woman. Then later, this couple came and they told us that we were sitting in their seats, and we were like "oh sorry!" and then they were like "no, it's ok! We'll sit in front!" and then the woman we were next to was like "no, I want to talk to you!" and then she turned to us and said very rudely "you have to move!!" I mean, I understand that she was probably pissed off that there were some kids sitting next to her when she was with her friends, but I would have been a bit more polite. Evil ho.

      I just got back from New York tonight, and it was sooo much fun! I was sad when we had to go home because I was enjoying being away from my family for a while! You know what's really fun about going on a trip for a few days with a smallish group of people? You go home with all these inside jokes and you become better friends than you were before. The only bad thing about the trip was that we were completely exhausted the entire time. And that 3 hour boat tour sucked too. I'll talk more about my trip tomorrow, but for now, I'm really tired and I'm going to bed! G'night!

      I'm leaving for New York in just a few hours! I'm so excited! My main worry is that my bag is going to be bigger than everyone elses. I mean, wouldn't it be embarassing if you went on a trip and brought this big bag and realized that everyone else just brought a knapsack? Well, I know that you can't just bring a knapsack for a 4 day trip, but I had a scary dream last night that it happened. And then I had a dream that my alarm didn't go off and I missed my 1 o'clock exam, and then I woke up with a start and realized that it was 6:22 and I only had to wake up at 11. So I went back o sleep and slept right up until my alarm went off (and it DID go off!).  The French exam was really easy. Half the test was actually a practise test that we did in February, but I didn't remember the answers. Jess thinks that they changed the questions but I don't even remember that.  EEEP! It's already 8:00! I'm leaving in 2 and a half hours!!!

      I'm so bad at this packing thing. I just went downstairs to get a bag to pack my stuff in since I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, I brought it upstairs and then...I just got bored and left. I'll have to do it eventually though because I won't have much time tomorrow what with my sleeping tll 12 and my exam at 1.  I am so un-prepared for the French exam. Our teacher left on maternity leave about a month before school ended, so we had a sub and we didn't do ANY practise exams. Not that it's the sub's fault. And French isn't something I can study for because what it is is that you read a few stories and then answer questions about them. But I haven't had a French class in so long that I'm starting to forget how to speak the friggin language.   Mireille posted a new page on her site. It's really funny.  urlLink www.holybeaver.com/gum.html   And a big HAPPY BIRTHDAY to Kelly!!!!

      Here are some links to this reeeaaaally funny condensed parodies of the three Lord of the Rings movies, written by Molly J. Ringle. I read the first two a long time ago, and I just came across the third one today, so I just had to share! I know that they're long, but they're definitely worth reading if you've seen the movies, and twice as funny if you've read the books. Enjoy!   urlLink The Fellowship of the Ring   urlLink The Two Towers   urlLink The Return of the King

      Lane is mad at me because I never mentioned him on my blog. LANE!!!! There. I hope you're happy.  I had the first part of my math exam today. It was so easy that I thought it was a joke. I kept going over the entire test, checking to see if I missed something. But I think that the second part of the test will be a bit harder. It's going to be on Tuesday, but since I'm going to be in NEW YORK!!!!!!!!! on a school trip, I'm taking it the next Monday.   I'm leaving for New York this coming Monday at 11 at night and we're going to sleep on the bus and wake up in Manhattan at 7:30...and then we're going on a boat tour right away. So, we're going to be all gross because we won't have had a chance to brush our teeth or anything. The guy organizing the trip (he's a guidance counselor from BHS...we're going on the trip with them) is like this old dirty hippie man. When we had this big meeting at his school, he looked like he hadn't showered in days and he had long grey greasy hair that was tied back in a ponytail. And he told us that there wasn't going to be time on the trip for lunch or going to the bathroom, so we just assume that he's some sort of mutant whose body doesn't require the same things that a normal person's body does. You know, like food, and disposing of waste, and other little things of that nature.  So, to finish off my blog entry, LANE LANE LANE LANE LANE.

      Yay! I now have more than one reader! Apparently, Steven is also reading my blog, and maybe even some other people! So that means that I have no choice but to update regularily, in order to keep Mireille and Steven happy.   So, yesterday I went to see Harry Potter for the third time with Amanda. I know, I know, I have no life. But we wanted to see it again just to laugh at a bunch of jokes that we made about the movie. Haha. Isn't it annoying when someone comes into the theatre late and sits down RIGHT next to you even though there's a whole empty row in front of you? And isn't it annoying when they chew popcorn really loud at all the quiet parts? Ya, that's what happened. Plus, she was leaning over the armrest so that I had to keep moving further and further to the opposite side of the chair.   Today was pretty boring. I spent the whole day studying for math and making my memory aid. That's about it. I did some studying outside but then these two huge pigeons started flying back and forth over my head and I was scared that they would shit on me so I went inside. I did the same yesterday and it was way hotter and there weren't any birds flying around. But there were a lot of scary bugs. Ya. So that's my story. :)

      Hey all. Last day of school is tomorrow!! It's really stupid how they made the last day of school a Monday. Most people are just skipping. I think I'm going to go for about half the day and then hang out at Twist and Cream or Tim Hortons for the rest. And then on Thursday I've got my math exam, which I bet will be easy (they always are). You see, we (the enriched math class) always get the same exam as the regular math class, so it's always very easy and I pass with a ninety-something. Maybe I shouldn't jinx it though.  So I went to see Harry Potter on Friday with Courtney, Kayla, and Amanda, and since we got there before the doors even opened, we had to wait about an hour outside. It's a good thing it was so hot out. There was this huge line of (mainly) teenagers and they ended up being the best audience. Everyone cheered and screamed at everything. But it was a really good movie. I think it was better than the first two by far. I think that the first two movies were a bit overly-faithful to the books, but they were still good. Since it was SUCH a good movie, I decided to go again on Saturday with Stew, who had also seen it on Friday, but not with me. We spent the whole time pointing out mistakes and differences from the books. Even though I like how the movie wasn't too faithful to the books, I was still upset that they left out the part where Gryffindor wins the Quidditch Cup. Oh well.  I'm going to my cast party in about an hour. In May, I was in a play called Once Upon A Mattress and I played Queen Aggravain, this bitch who never stops talking and simply refuses to let her son get married. It was a lot of fun. At the cast parties, we used to all watch the video of the play together, but we don't do that anymore because a lot of people would talk and bother everyone else who was TRYING to enjoy watching it. So now we just hang out in the director's backyard and eat cake and hotdogs. But don't worry, we DO get to see our video because everyone takes one home with them along with their pictures.

      Hello! I'm back for my...*counts on fingers*...second post! Wow, time's just flown by, hasn't it! After supper, I'm going over to my friend Rachel's house with 3 other girls to work on a project. We have to perform two scenes from a Midsummer Night's Dream that we translated into modern English. And guess what? It's due tomorrow! And we're only starting today! What fun! But all we have left to do is blocking, costumes, line-memorizing, and probably some more things that will come up at the last second. In one part I play a fairy, more specifically, Fairy #1, who sings Titania, the Fairy Queen, to sleep. Yes, sings. I made a tune to the song and I'm prepared to completely embarass myself in front of my English class. But the teacher will probably like that. Maybe I'll get extra marks.  Awww!!! How cute! Hamster just moved! I'm sitting at the dining room table where the laptop is set up, and right across from me is the hamster cage. We call our hamster Hamster, but his real name is Nathan. It's funny how my family never calls our pets by their real name, except maybe my mom. Our turtle's name was Tina Toto, but we all called her Turtle. Then my mom gave her away. I've never forgiven her. Then, when we got our first hamster, we named him Fangorian Grishnaak of the Ol'School. Don't ask. But, of course, we all called him Hamster. And then he died. And our new hamster is Nathan. So anyways, Hamter, who is nocturnal and sleeps throughout the day, just woke up and stuck his cute little nose out of his nest. Adorable. Till next time!

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY J.K. ROWLING AND HARRY POTTER!   Hehe, sorry. I just had to announce it. I don't know how old J.K. is, but I think she's almost 40. And for Harry it depends. If you go by which book was released the most recently, then he's 16, but if you go by the dates of the books that some hard-core fans have figured out, then he's 24.

      I recently found out that I have two new readers! Jess and Amanda have both come and read my blog. Hooray! All the more reason to update more frequently!   I recently started an advice column on Mireille's site,  urlLink Holy Beaver! , called Dear Dr. Ver. People are sending me serious questions about anything they can think of, and I am answering them. I must say, I give some very good advice. Go to  urlLink www.holybeaver.com/drver.html  and submit your own questions! You never know, I may just answer them.

      My three readers are all mad at me because I haven't updated in a very long time. So here ya go, Mireille, Lane, and Steven!   The other day I was a runner at my pool's swim meet. I did it last year and the year before, but never have I gotten such a good workout. Maybe I should explain what a runner is first. You see, at these swim meets, every swimmer has a card with their name, age group, stroke, and whatever on it. Usually about 2 runners have the task of taking the cards from the swimmers and giving them to the timers, who are seated at the other end of the pool. Once the swimmer finishes, the timer writes down their time on their card. Then, from there, usually about 2 different runners takes the cards with the times and everything to the main table where they write it all down. So, in all, we normally have 3 or 4 runners.   However, the other day, I was fortunate enough to be the ONLY runner! The lifeguards were nice enough to help me out, but it was still a lot to do. The lifeguards would all bring the cards of their swimmers to the timers, and I took the cards from all 6 timers to the main table. It's a very repetitive job, but you get a great leg workout, and for the most part it's fun. And I got a free piece of watermelon! And then I stole a second. But don't tell the person who cut up the watermelon, whoever that may be...

      Well I went up north on Thursday and came back Sunday. It was really fun, but by the last day I was glad to leave because I was getting really pissed off at certain people that were there with me. On Saturday, me and my cousin Dana tried using the rowboat, and we didn't put on lotion because we were just planning on rowing around a bit and coming back, but once we got out onto the lake, we were just having so much fun that we decided to go all the way to the other side of the lake (which is far) and back. We left at 1:30 and got back at 5, and then we realized that we never ended up putting on lotion, and it was a very sunny day, so I ended up getting a burn on my back and shoulders, my upper legs, and a bit on my face. At first I didn't care, but then ever since then it's been really hurting, and that sucks. Now it's peeling. Ewwwwwww!  On Tuesday I went to the water slides!!! It was a lot of fun, but I kept on re-applying my lotion because I was so scared that my sun burn would get worse because at the time it was hurting a lot. But it doesn't really hurt anymore.    The other day I saw the movie Spiderman 2. It is SUCH a good movie, it's amazing. Definitely better than the first. I cannot believe how good that movie was. It had everything: action, romance, and a lot of other stuff. If you haven't seen this movie yet, then I strongly urge you to.

       I went to LaRonde with Amanda today!!! We rode the metro ALL BY OURSELVES to get there! Since it was my first time going by myself on the metro, Mireille wrote the directions down on a piece of paper for me. Last night, I read them over and over again because I was so paranoid about getting lost, so when I finally got to the metro, I didn't need to look at it because I had memorized it off by heart...      When we finally got there, we were so excited that we kept going "YAY!" in high-pitched voices. First we went on The Cobra, this standing up roller coaster. Very fun. There was absolutely no line because we got there just as the amusement park opened. Then we went on a few other things, including the Monster, WHICH IS THE CRAZIEST ROLLER COASTER IN THE  WORLD ! Then we had lunch at Subways.      After lunch, we went on a few more things, including this water ride where you drop 15 metres into a pool and get COMPLETELY drenched. It was fun, but we were very cold afterwards and took to walking around with our towels draped around us. But we were still cold. :( Then we decided that since we had enjoyed The Monster so much, that we wanted to go again, except this time be at the front of the roller coaster. It was even MORE fun the second time around. Since it's a wooden (and very rickety) roller coaster, the whole time you think that the train is going to fly off the tracks, or flip over or something, and you also think that you're going to smash into a beam. And the drops are really steep. AND, all you have to keep you in your seat is a bar that doesn't even go down to your legs. There's also a seatbelt, but it was really loose and I had no time to tighten it, so it didn't really do much. It is the bumpiest ride I've ever been on. After going on it for the second time, we decided to go on two more times in a row, each time sitting at the very front. It's better to sit at the front because you have no idea what's going to happen next. When there's the rest of the train in front of you, you know what's going to happen a split second before it does,  so it's not as scary. And scary is good.      Right before it was time to go, we had supper at Subways AGAIN. Then we went home by metro again, and we were very, very tired. I can't believe I woke up at 7:30...I'm used to waking up at 1! I don't know HOW I got through waking up so early for school last year. ANYWHO, when going to LaRonde, I strongly advise you to bring extra money, because everything is so expensive. If you want to use a locker, you have to pay 2 dollars EVERY TIME YOU FRIGGIN WANT TO OPEN IT! Another thing you should do is BRING A WATER BOTTLE. I put one in the freezer last night and then I forgot to take it with me this morning. All I had to keep me hydrated was a coke...and that doesn't keep you hydrated very well. In fact, I think it actually DE-hydrates you. Also, if you ever plan on going, take a towel. I've been to LaRonde 4 times and I've needed a towel every single time, whether it be because of rain or because of a very wet ride.       And that was my day!

       As you can see, I have found out that I can write blogs in different colours. Why was I not informed of this earlier? HMM??      Well, nothing much has happened these past few days. AHHHH!! LIGHTNING!!! Sorry. ANYWAYS, all the back-to-school commercials have started. I know, I know, it's terrible. *sniff*  I mean, school doesn't even start for a month! Yet they INSIST on reminding us every day that sooner or later we're going to have to go back-to-school shopping. Oh, the pain, the pain of it all. Normally at this time of year I'm a bit excited to go back and start a new year, only to realize that I shouldn't have been excited at all. But this year, I'm not going to fool myself. I DON'T WANNA GO BACK TO SCHOOL! I WANT SUMMER TO LAST FOREVER! I really pity those who have to go to summer school...      It's raining and thundering and lightning outside, as you may have guessed from my little outburst before. I just hope that the electricity doesn't go out right now and delete this entire long, very colourful blog entry. *hurries to save post*
