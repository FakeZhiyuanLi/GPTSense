       Whoa. I am mighty bored! My eyes are all glossy and weird right now. . .  It's kind of cool. .? My face feels numb again. Sheesh! I am soo hungry! Ugh. . Today, my family was eating these sub things and ym mom got me a "fuhlafful" or whatever, because I'm a vegetarian. It was really gross. Then, I saw one of the Cuban Sub thingies, and it looked so gross, I threw up. It had like so much meat on it. . .  Ugh. .  Poor animal :'(     Does anyone have a suggestion as to which book I should read? I really feel like reading right now. (Usually when I'm depressed, I feel the need to read or accomplish something, that's why I am trying to do anything I possibly can!). Well, I didn't cut today! *high five* but i did cry. . . a lot. . . I don't know. I really shouldn;t be talking about this becaue it WILL make me angry again. I feel like getting high. Like, LSD high. Ugh. . . I am such a loser. YAHOO! My mom bought some booze!  Like, a LOT of alcoholic beverages. It's crazy. Okay, well I am gonna go.  Buh- Bye!     **Kat    current mood:  hungry current music: BRIGHT EYES!!!

       Hello! Today was really neat-o! I hung out with Sierra, Dan and Tim all day at the Rec. Center. We were supposed to get something. . .Uh. . yeah But we would have to wait an hour to get it and we were supposed to be picked up at 8:30 and it was already 8:00. So instead we went to ASTRO. That was really cool. I saw Aida there, which was really cool since I haven't seen her in like 5 months. So I hung out with her, Lauren, Robby, Sierra, Derek and like a lot of other people. It was great. Then Sierra started freaking out and going all wacko. I'm not sure what happened. She was breathing really hard and laughing and She started getting really numb. I was scared. But about an hour or so later she snapped out of it. That made me happy.   So it turns out that me and Christine aren't friends anymore and that doesn't bother me one bit. She is still my friend. . . Oh well. Right now I am at Joey Colado's house with Sierra babysiting his little sister, Taedem. She's cool. . . for a 9 year old. I love it because we get FREE FOOD and INTERNET ALL NIGHT!! YIPPEE!! God, I effin' love this! Well. .  What else should I write about? Hmm. .  AHA! I tripped Angelia Gallehue today at Astro! It felt soo good! Only because she knows how to skateboard and I don't. .so HA! Well at least I did an 'Ollie' which is pretty hard to do! I did it twice! *high five!*  I think I need a boyfriend. A real boyfriend. Not like John. You guys don;t knwo John, so I'm not gettinginto that. All I can say is. .  Well a lot happened, and I feel uncomfortable saying it. Not even Christine knows about it. I never felt the need to tell her because she might think I'm a "slut" or something bad like that. I feel guilty. But at the same time I don't? I don't know. Haha. Eeew! I'm watching the Texas Chainsaw Masacre right now for the fourth time and it's still really gross. Not scary, GROSS. Which reminds me. I had to clean up two HUGE piles of dog puke today. YUCK!!!! It was rather disgusting. I think I almost made a third pile! lol. That would have sucked. Blah. I don't know what elso to write. I'm trying to make this entry really long because I have never done that before. Well, at least not THIS long.   Ha! Sierra and I traded pants and I gave her my "jizz" pants! lol. It's not actual "Jizz", it's glue. But it's on the crotch and it looks pretty bad! haha. I couldn't stop laughing about it! heh. Jizz. Hah.Oh my Gosh I love Funions! Sheesh! We're like eating all of Joeys food! I feel bad. But it sure tastes good! We had Goldfish, Fudge Rounds, Cheese Nips, Funions and Coke.I have to stay up all night and I'm already really tired. I don't know if I can do it. .  WISH ME LUCK!   Okay, Well I guess I'm done. Have a nice night/morning and I'll write to you later! G'BYE!     -Kat

      Today I feel HORRIBLE! I can't believe I actually did what I what I've done. . . I hit her. My Mother! I was so fed up and annoyed that I couldn't take it anymore. I believe I really did fuck everything up this time. The  only thing I can do right now is to not think about it. I want to read my book but Christine has it. Christine is (actually, was) my best friend. She is a great person, but I can't do it. To her, I am always depressed and emotional and I keep bringing her down. I refuse to do that to her anymore. I know she does't deserve it. I'm starting to cry angain so I cannot talk about it. I cry a lot. Over the stupidest things, too. I guess all I really want is attention, but I never get it. So I cry. Even my doing that I just get yelled at. No one wants me here, but all I can do is my best and don't listen to them. I have to go by a more possitive mannor. I'm drinking Orange Soda. I love Orange Soda.     I looked at my arms yesterday. Actually LOOKED at them. Stared. It's scary because they're all covered in scars and they'll probably be there forever. I am ashamed. That's why I am trying to keep this journal a secret. So no on ewill know about it. Hm. I am extremely tired. I went to bed, say 2:30? And I woke up at like 5 something. I really wish we got that weed on Friday. I really need it. .  It was about $20-30 worth. Not too much, but enough.   Okay, well I'm done. Bye  -Kat
