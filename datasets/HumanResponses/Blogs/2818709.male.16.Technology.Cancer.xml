      "Homosexuality is never mentioned explicitly by any character save when Gene says that Finny’s pink shirt makes him look like a “fairy.” But the relationships in the book are all between boys (we never see them interact with girlfriends or mothers, except for one brief scene with Leper’s mother), and the central relationship contains hints of an almost sexual attraction between Gene and Finny. When the boys go to the beach, for instance, Gene remarks that his friend’s skin “radiated a reddish copper glow of tan, his brown hair had been a little bleached by the sun, and I noticed that the tan made his eyes shine with a cool blue-green fire.” Although the language is not expressly homoerotic, Gene’s words suggest that the connection between him and Finny is, if not sexual, then at least strongly physical: the boys direct their affection toward each other’s whole beings, increasing the intensity of their bond."

I still need to order teh dani's valentines-day-present-thingimajiig. If it doesnt get here on time...i'll have to give her something cheezy...like..a rose or something....   You are my only girl, but you're not my owner girl. Talk to me... dance with me here in the spotlight, girl. Talk to me... dance with me here. You're the spotlight girl. So perfect you paint it... yet so manipulated. So calm and so patient... yet oh so calculated. So safe and comforting... this doesn't feel like flirting. So fun I'm distracted... forgot you keep track of it.  Hot hot heat - "Talk to me, Dance with me"  Song almost works, but...*cant dance*  [Back in the USSR]

It would be THEIR fault for failing. The F is punishment enough. Ok, now on the fact that she DID NOT give them/us proper notes. BTW, my class all failed the test too. We got the same notes, but no detention.

      Alright. I wrote this in Geometry, so that I could cheer myself up. It's kinda long, so you might want to go pee...or grab a snack...or some popcorn. Here goes:  Only In Dreams - Weezer  From what  I  can see, our gereration is a generation fo dreamers. Basically, everyone claims that they have something that they dont. I.E. - "My uncle works for the CIA."  "I got a 35 on the ACT". I, for one, am tired of the damn lies. Be yourself. Don't pretend that you are something that you are not. I hear a constant stream of BS flowing from people's mouths wherever I go. - The one exception to this, is Dani. I'm not going to go get mushy, cause that would be kinda off topic, but, she doesnt bs me all the time. I admire that SO much it's not even funny. Back to the rant - I am an honest person as much as I possibly can be, whenever I can be. I'm not saying that I'm a saint, cause everyone fucks up somewhere along the line, but at least I try. My life has NOT been all that great...but it hasn't been all that bad. Just...average. Out of 46 people in our grade, I'm ranked 26th as far as grades go. Average. On my PSAT (Doesnt matter, but ok...) I got a 46 in math, a 51 in writing, and a 48 in writing skills. Average. I'm fscking DYING to find something that I'm good at. I'm (contrary to popular belief) NOT that good at video games. I'm NEVER the best person at a game...and I use strategy guides cause i'm a perfectionist. Sides, being good at video games isnt exactly appealing in the job market of today. I'm going to do something. Something that sets me apart from the swarm. Another thing that pisses me off. When people complain about grades 90% and up. STFU. It's an A. They dont give a damn about your number grade on your transcript, they just write down the letter.  So, if you could, I'd like to know what i'm good at.  E-mail me...I would tell you to put it in my tagboard...but I forgot where the code was to put one in.  Thank you,  Nick.

      Do you know a story that goes like this? There once was a tiger-striped cat. This cat died a million deaths and was reborn a million times and was owned by various people who he didn't really care for. The cat wasn't afraid to die... One day, the cat was a free cat, a stray cat. He met a white female cat, and the two cats spent their days happily together. Years passed, and the white cat was taken away from him. The tiger-striped cat cried a million times, and then he died. But this time, the cat was not reborn.

      Note on the last post - I may be just an assuming little dumbass. I dont know. But, it's my nature to think the worst...so..yeah  What the hell? It's cool. I dont need to know what goes on in the house that I live in. It's not like i live here or anything. I'm tired of all the shit that goes on in my house. Even chris noticed it when he came over. He was like "Ok, wtf? Your house seems like it would be a TENSE place to live in." Everyone in this house keeps things from one another. I always try to tell everyone where I'm going, and what I'm doing. No one EVER bothers to tell me these things. Is that too much to ask? To know where the people that you live with are? I'm tired of the bs that adam does, too. I ask him, "Hey, what's that?", and he's looking at a piece of paper, or reading a book, and he replys with a sassy "Nothing, nick, absolutely nothing." Then, in my head, i'm thinking to myself, "what the hell? what was that for?" then I go on and try to think of what I did to deserve it. At least, that's what I used to do. Now I've realized that adam is a fucking little prick. That NEVER thinks of anyone but himself. Same thing goes with his damn mother. Never anyone but ADAM, she thinks about. She thinks about/does things for adam more than she does things/thinks about my dad!!!! What the!?!? No WONDER adam's a spoiled little bitch. No WONDER he never does his homework. His mom always does it for him. The SECOND he gets into college, (knowing him, he'll end up in an ivy league, sheerly by mooching on his mom) he's going to flunk. He never does anything for himself. I always see victoria reading the books that he needs to read for a project, and writing notes down. Sometimes, she writes the ENTIRE paper for him! All he has to do is type it, and he complains! God damnit. I hate him. I hate the way he looks. I hate the way he talks. I hate the way he walks. I hate the way he treats people.  I really shouldnt be talking about the way he treats people. I'm just as much of a jackass. I talk about things to people that shouldnt know these things.    Are you listening?  [/life]  (In case anyone is thinking that I'm gonna take a knife to my wrist, or sport a spiffy russian necktie, no worries, I'm too much of a pansy to off myself.)

      Hmm...I'm bored. Very bored. I'm watching "Hellraiser:Bloodline". Pinhead is one scary ass mofo.  Well, another topic. What to do with dani this weekend? Hmm...Movies? At my house? At the movies? Nothing's good out. Well, dani hasn't seen LOTR:RTK yet...Maybe we'll go see that. What else is there to do in okc? Well. Dani, get back to me on this. I dont know. Dani could just come over and hang out. We could sit around and play some video games or something.   ?

      AIII!!! No one else switch to blogger. I'm running out of suits/positions!!!  And no, "White Joker" is not a racist remark. There are usually 2 jokers in a deck. The Black Joker, and the White Joker. Kacy's not morbid, or so i think, and she's baptist. Therefore, white joker.

       If you're listening. Sing it back. String from your tether unwinds. Up and outward (but only) to bind. I was spinning free with a little sweet and simple numbing me. Are you listening? Sing it back. So tell me what do I need when the words lose their meaning. I was spinning free with a little sweet and simple numbing me.  Yeah, stumble until you crawl. Sinking into sweet uncertainty. If you're listening. Are you listening? Sing it back.  I'm still running away. I won't play your hide and seek game. I was spinning free with a little sweet and simple numbing me. What a dizzy dance. This sweetness will not be concerned with me. No the sweetness will not be concerned with me.

      VacantSilhouette: This is just fscking weird. VacantSilhouette: My folks came home, and victoria saw her foot lotion or whatever sitting out. AnorexicSwan: what VacantSilhouette: She came in, and said "have you been using my foot lotion" and i said "no" AnorexicSwan: lol VacantSilhouette: I've been sitting on my ass, playing video games the entire time that they've been gone. VacantSilhouette: Oh yeah, and i went to the living room to watch csi for an hour. VacantSilhouette: Then they started yelling at me. VacantSilhouette: I was like "WTF!??!" AnorexicSwan: Ugh, I'm sorry VacantSilhouette: Leave me alone! VacantSilhouette: The funny thing to do, would be to say, ok, you think i used that? come here, smell my hands, feet, and underwear. If you can find traces of hand lotion, then i'll pay you. I'll fscking PAY YOU. AnorexicSwan: lol AnorexicSwan: Yeah.. AnorexicSwan: wait.. AnorexicSwan: Oh..gross. VacantSilhouette: Yeah, you caught the underwear part? VacantSilhouette: Yes. VacantSilhouette: I'm sure that's what they were thinking. VacantSilhouette: I'm gonna kill em.  Seriously. I didn't. I swear to god. I've been playing video games/watching CSI the entire time they were gone. There was NO forearm exercise.      Anyways, on another note. I was VERY angry today. VERY angry. What about, you ask? Life. All aspects of it, but i'm not going to go into that. You can ask me IRL if you wish, i might explain it. I decided to ride my bike. I havnt ridden my bike in a while, but it's basically the equivalent of a punching bag to me. This time, i was really mad. I live on 38th and Western. I rode my bike to 70th and western. Yeah, i was pissed. Then i rode my bike back to my house, decided i wasnt quite ready to go in yet, and rode my bike to super cao nguyen. I was really thirsty by this time. I was PLANNING on going inside, and getting a drink or something. But nooooo. I forgot my wallet. Damnit. No passion-fruit green tea for me. Or fizzy drink. Or Sarsi. I really wanted a sarsi....

      Damn, i'm getting the feeling of uselessness again. I guess i'll resume my quest for the thing that i'm good at. I havnt found it yet. I think that i make people smile, but...i dont see how that can be related to a career. Unless i'm a clown. Clowns dont get paid well. Especially Ass-Clowns. I couldnt become a pro-comedian, because there are times when I cant think of SHI* when i'm improving/reciting. Uh...If I was a doctor i would get sued for something or the other. I'd probably crack jokes about smoking/blondes to the blonde cancer patients...Yeah, i'm that odd. Hmmm...Anything else? I could become a webcomic artist, but that doesnt get the $. At all. Cept for piro, but he doesnt count. That lazy mofo. lol. I could become a pool cleaner. But i'd pour arsenic or cyanide into people's pools for fun...How about a psychologist? no...malpractice suit. I'd make fun of people on my lunch break. I'm sorry if I cant keep a straight face when someone tells me that they have a crooked penis (Yes, that was a reference from the movie "cheaters". Damn you Napplebee!!!). Or when they tell me that their wife wants in the @$$, and that they are afraid of diseases and such. Or when they tell me that their grandma beat them as a teenager (They could have fought back...Old lady...Take a baseball bat to her hip.) Or when they tell me that they are deathly afraid of TPS reports (Office Space Reference). Or their boss. Or if they tell me that they want to swim in a sea of penii (South park reference). Or when they tell me that their computer told them to follow the white rabbit (Matrix Reference. Duh.). Well, i'm going to stop this now. All of the fragments are giving me a headache. ....  Wtf? eric's doing pushups in the middle of my room. I'm scared...he was just taking a nap. Bye.

      !!!  Crystal Chronicles! Adam's a biotch! Why, why didnt he get it??!? He lost his gameboy!??!? tough! Find it, bitch. Suffer for your mistake. In the meantime, i'll play ff:CC!  Well, instead of going in half-sies on FF:CC, cause adam's a bitch, i bought Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. It's a pretty fun game. I AM the dark side. ph33r m4 wr4th. *Uses choke* Whaddyathinkofmenow, biatch! I just pwnzed an entire sith academy. Those biotches were annoying. There were like, 50 of them. Me with my puny-ass droids couldnt do anything against them...But then i used "drain life" and "Force Lightening", and everything was better. All was well. UNTIL THERE WERE 50 MORE. And i had no force left!!! I still pwnzed, cause i whipped out my double-sided lightsaber, and fscking pwnzed. After that, i went up into my ship, for a nice ride to tatooine to check and see if it was destroyed, and then darth malak's wench, mr. whatever, decided that he was going to use his tractor beam, and pull me into his ship. He's a tough mofo...He really is. He's got like 4 Dark Jedi guarding him...And he's got that BFG. I died, and i forgot to save, so i'm a ways back from there,  but i can get back...no problem.

        You belong in another of my worlds. The world of self-destructive tendencies, either through actual physical destructiveness or emotional breakdowns that you keep bottled up inside, thus hurting yourself. You feel that life is nothing but pain, and you see red in everything with the memories of the blood you have bled(literally or figuratively) for your hurting. You live in a hidden land that few will ever understand or see in you, because you keep it to yourself and only let a few rare people into the truth of your reality. Er...I don't condone my own actions, so I really don't know what else to say. Of course, you could also just REALLY like blood....or you might be homicidal, not suicidal. ^_^;    urlLink   Where do you belong?(ANIME IMAGES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I guess those results are right.

      The interesting events of my day...  11:25-1:25 pm - Well, i got bored. To say the least. Mrs. Swagerty had a bottle of "Astec-Drink" sitting up on top of her filing cabnet. It had been there all year, so one could come to the conclusion that she was not planning on consuming it. I "borrowed" her drink, and furrer/dani/parker/me decided to take the liberty of partaking in the fermented squeezed-sixth graders. They were quite tasty. My companion furrer and I walked back to the HS, and refilled the bottle with an automobile anti-freeze mixture that was neon-green in color. Then I placed the bottle back where I borrowed it from. Now, Furrer/Parker/I thought that it was going to take her a couple of days to notice it, but she almost immediately noticed the un-natural substance, and knew instaniously that it was either furrer or I. Because we enjoy playing practical jokes on the english kook. At first, i thought that she was going to suspend or expell me, but it turns out that she can take a joke.  1:30 - 6:00 pm - My Dad and I went for a drive. First, we stopped at city bites because he hadn't taken the liberty to partake in his noon-time nutrition meal. Soon after, we drove to the optomitrist because I had not had my eyes checked in a few years, so I needed to check if i was blind or not. Turns out, that the stigmatism in my right eye has become worse, and my left eye's vision has grown worse. Oh well. Time heals all wounds...(wtf? that saying doesnt work). We payed the sadistic-nurse lady that was wearing a pentagram, and then we went next door to find me a new pair of spectacles. Me, being a geek, immediatly went to the "matrix" line of glasses, and picked out what I wanted. Only $70. The glasses would take an hour or two to make, so my dad and I went to run a couple more errands. We first walked to "Guitar Center" which has a lot of musical instruments/audio supplies. We went there because my dad needed a "Midi +" cable.  My dad psyched out the geeks at GC when he asked for it, they all had the general expression of "wtf is that?" They didnt have it, so we went to check at Best Buy. Yeah. Right. Like best buy would have ANYTHING remotely useful besides video games. I saw a few middle-school astecians...They didnt acknowledge me...i didnt acknowledge them, typical astecian meeting. My dad and I got bored, so we went back to check on my glasses 30 minutes early. For some reason or another, they were finished. When i put them on, i walked around, and ran into a few things. Damn depth perception. Fix yourself. We then went to audio dimensions to check on the 38 inch tv that would be going into my room when it was repaired. My dad had aquired it from a customer that claimed "Yeah, it works fine, I just havnt used it for 2 years." Oh well. The joke was on him. It cost $180 to repair, and new, it cost $900. We couldnt pick up the tv, of course, because we dont have the $ to pay for it right now, but it will be mine soon...After that, we went to one of the famly friend's house. Well. Soon-to-be house. They just bought it, but it's a "fixer-upper". By "fixer-upper", i mean POS. But, the support is still mostly intact, so it'll become a good house. The man that used to star on the show "Sheriff Bill" lived there. When they found him, he had been buying cases of jack daniels, drinking all the liquer in the bottle, and then pissing in the bottle, and laying the bottle to the side. Needless to say, he didnt maintain the building very well. On the way out, my dad started talking about some chili that tammy made. (we were at ken and tammy's house). My dad had some...problems with that chili. Then, he started talking about how him and victoria were having sex, and then the chili started acting up...*shudders* DAD! I DONT WANT TO HEAR THESE THINGS! DAMN YOU TO HELL. Then I hit him a few times, and we went home.   Alright, that was my day. I'm still trying to let my eyes adjust to this new prescription.

Otis came over for a while...we went and flew kites...he picked up on it a LOT faster than chris. By the end of the run, he knew what he was doin! He was crashing and recovering at the end...very nice. Then we rode to super cao nguyen, and otis discovered the goodness of passion fruit green tea. Mmmm. 140 grams of sugar a bottle. tasty.

       I am jack's raging ulcer.   Holy shit. My dad is so fucking pissed. I got "D"s in english, chem., and US history. Dad sees those as "F"s. He decided that i was going to get my hair cut. Now it's fscking short. about 2 inches. compared to my 5 inches of before. I dont know if i'll be going to dev's party. I dont know if i'm even going to bother living. Jesus christ. Why cant I get homework done? I just cant fscking get myself to do it. I dont know why. I just cant make myself sit down and do homework. All the teachers think that the recent downfall of my grades is because of dani (they told my dad this). NO. It's not. They sucked BEFORE i started dating dani. Assholes. He was literally screaming at me in the car. As loud as he could. Well. I dont think that i'll be playing video games, talking on aim, or doing anything that i've been doing for the past month. I'll be at digitalhistory.uh.edu studying for u.s. history. And reading my chem book. And trying to convince my dad that i'm not a miserable failure. Because that's apparently what he thinks of me.

      A lot of people have been asking me this question "are you ok?"...  I dont know. I'm really...really frustrated with a few people...  I've decided to stop whining about the "abc/nbc", because it doesnt help anything. Sometimes i'm just a dumbass.   Sigh. I really wish i could go see a counselor/shrink...It'd help to tell someone these things, but, there's no one I can trust. At all...^_^;  Alright...I'm going to go do something...anything...to get my mind off of this.

      Heh, i got bored, and this is my aim profile.  I woke up in a dream today...   Death is nothing but a dream that you watch for eternity.  They say i'm a dreamer, but i'm not the only one.  I woke up in a dream today.  I started thinking of all of the songs and phrases I could that had the word "dream" in them, and those were the first 3 that showed up. They go together quite nicely. The references are: Linkin Park, Vincent, and John Lennon. Tell me which one's which? First one that does, gets a prize. Otis does not count for this prize. Because i told him. Too bad for otis.

      I'm probably going to get fucking bitched at about this, and i'm NOT trying to start a problem or anything, it's just that poor chuckles iss a bit out-numbered here. And i agree with him. If you dont like the rules, go the fsck away. That's what i'm doing. I have no problem with it. Homework is fucking pointless. The ONLY homework that is remotely plausable is studying. That is good. IF YOU CANT GET THE POINT ACROSS IN AN HOUR, WHY BOTHER. Give us tests, i say.Weekly tests. Tests are good. HW is bad. This isnt because i'm lazy, because i'm really not. I just completely disagree with the whole homework thing. And i'm  not saying that I purposely dont do homework, either. I'm not doing it because "it's a belief thing". I just cant do it...again, i dont know why. Homework and I just dont get along.

      Top ten reasons why computers are better than boy/girlfriends:  10. You can turn them off when you're done with them. 9. They never say, "You can't login tonight, I have a headache." 8. You can tell them anything, and they will always listen. 7. You can program them to give you the answers you want to hear. 6. They are never too tired. 5. If you come home at 3am, they don't ask where you've been. 4. They don't hog the bed and steal all the covers. 3. They don't eat (unless you count disks). 2. They remember everything you want them to remember, and forget everything you want them to forget. 1. They never complain that you don't take them anywhere.  Top ten reasons why boyfriends/girlfriends are better than computers:  10. You don't need a password to get in. 9. They won't shut down if there's a power outage. 8. It's difficult to take a computer to bed. 7. The Aide Station never gets calls asking for advice on someone's love life. 6. A computer won't laugh at your jokes. 5. You might get a few strange looks if you bring a computer to a drive-in movie. (Do they still HAVE those?) 4. When you use bad grammar on a computer, you get all sorts of nasty messages (Note: this could also hold true for boy/girl- friends if one happens to be an English major, but not generally). 3. Computers don't give back-rubs. 2. You can't put your freezing feet on a computer's leg to warm them up. [Well, you could, but: 1) they wouldn't get very warm, and 2) you wouldn't have the pleasure of hearing the computer shriek]. 1. You can't have sex with a computer. [Again, I suppose you could, but it might be dangerous...]   I dont know, i'm goin with the first one, but you can make up your own minds.

      Guess what, guys and gals? It's story time!  There once was a tiger-striped cat. This cat died a million deaths, and lived a million lives and was owned by many different people he didn't really care for. This cat wasn't afraid to die. Then, one day this cat became a stray cat, which meant it was free and he met a white, female cat and the two of them spent their days together happily. Well, years past and the white cat grew weak and died of old age. The tiger stripped cat cried a million times, then he died too, except this time, he didn't come back to life.  - Spike  There once was a little girl who was very lonely. This little girl was given a puppy by her parents. The little girl fawned over the puppy, giving it many toys and treats. Weeks later, the little girl got bored with the puppy, and cast it aside. The puppy cryed, and cryed, but the little girl wouldnt ever pay attention to it...  - Me  How does the story end? Only time will tell.

      Damn, i'm in a ranting mood tonight. Ok, wtf's with all of the "x-treme" advertising lately?!??! I.E. - x-treme jello, Corn Nuts: Corn gone BAD!, X-treme energy, Whoop-Ass energy drinks: For that extra boost of energy!, Sour Skittles - You'll pucker until you implode!!!. Ok...Why?!?! Yeah, we want to buy those bad-ass products. It makes us all feel special.  Sam - "look, bob, check out this -----, i'm a badass now!" Bob - "Duuuuuude. Sweeeeeet. I wanna tap that!" Sam - "fuck no." Bob - "I'll arm wrestle ya for it." Sam - "Hell no, cracka, i'll play ya a game of russian roulette for it." Bob - "Bitch, ya gonna be pissin leed!"  See how quickly that conversation deteriorated? That's what bad-ass marketing is doing to the poor, poor, easily influenced minds of the people of today. It needs to stop. Now. All of it. Why bother? To get the pre-pubescent teen boys in on it? I sincerely doubt that they are concerned with corn nuts. Or energy bars. Dumbasses.

      You know, i've always been the concrete person. I havn't believed in astrology since...um...ever. It doesnt make sense. At all. It's like saying "Hey, look, my cereal spoon is hot. That could mean that my mother is going to make sexual advances on the dentist today." I never have understood the human race's tendancy to find crutches for their grevious faults. Take some damn responsibility. Dont blame it on pluto. It never did anything to you. Poor planet. It's fucking cold. It's the same thing with religions. "----!!! Please help us! Our feet smell like a glass of 9 month old milk!" (---- can be replaced with jesus, buddah, fhwqbagads, mohammad, satan, god, darwin, pac-man, or any other deity under the clouds otherwise known as heaven.)  I mean, seriously, wtf would you have to be on to believe that some constellation can determine if you should ask someone out that day? "I shouldnt ask her today because my celestial alignment is opposing hers." No, your breath stinks. Take some damn tic-tacs. Dont anyone DARE say "You're just a closed-minded asshole." Look, I'm entitled to my opinion. So are you. Feel free to rant at me about this post.  In conclusion, the human race needs to shut the fuck up and take some responsibilty. Dont blame other people/things/celestial formations on your own faults.  [For all of you that were wondering, yes, there is a reason for this rant.

      What the hell is with feminists incessant ranting about equality? I'd say things are pretty damn fair right now as far as the US goes. Many women out there get paid more than men do. The only thing women havn't done in the us, is have one of them become the president. It will happen pretty soon. When a woman becomes president, i say that all of the feminism should stop. What are the feminist's main problems with the us of today? Let's check:  1. Strippers. Feminists hate strippers. The feminist thinks that just because the stripper is stripping, it degrades them. NO. It doesnt. They get paid REALLY well for it. You dont even have to be that GOOD of a stripper to do it! Jeez, just for jiggling your ass around for a while, you get money. Christ, i wish I could jiggle my ass around for a while to get some money. Like that's going to happen any time soon.  2. "The Glass Roof" above all business women. ...no. The only glass roof that I can see, is the presidency. Dont worry, that glass will meet it's grisly end by a louisville slugger soon.  3. Gender equality. Why there will never be absolute gender equality is because of the inherent contradictions between equality and liberty. For example, if a guy wanted to say a joke about women at work, or hung pornography in the work place, it would make the women work in an environment that may seem hostile to them. If someone at work frequently referred to women as chicks, and a woman was offended by it, the woman would then be working in a hostile environment. If a woman wants to be treated equally in the work place, then she shouldn't be offended at what guys usually talk about. I think it's unreasonable for all women to be content with whatever people do at work, and for guys to go out of their way to change their lifestyles to conform to what's politically correct. It's impossible to live your life without being offended at something. Violence, foul language, pornography, sex, religion, whatever it is, you're bound to be offended by it sooner or later. So rather than bitching about it, just deal with it and move on. Men aren't out to get women; we're not the bad guys. Besides, I'm sure that women make jokes about guys, too. I wouldnt know, because of my lack of estrogen, but, i'm pretty sure there are a pretty few jokes/shauvinist remarks about men from women. It's not like they have the inability to create them.  I'd rant more, but I want a bagel. ta ta.

      Responsiblity - My anti-drug.  ...no. If you're that stupid, that you would get stoned while you were babysitting,then you deserve to be shot. You couldnt even wait a couple of hours to take a hit on that toke. Again, the youth of the america of today is stupid. Very stupid. I cant believe that anyone would ever do something that idiotic. I wont. I have to keep on believing in my misconception that all of the people around me a virgins. I have to keep on believing that i'm not the only one that hasn't done drugs.   ok...i'm tooo tired. i need to stop before i get mopey. Why am I getting mopey?!?!? Damn you,tasty concord grapes. Let's blame EVERYTHING on everything around me. It's all my optical mouse's fault. If I didnt have it, I wouldnt want to use the computer.   Omg, i'm way too tired. I'm starting to get dyslexic.

      I could rant, but i dont feel like it. Does anyone actually read my rants? It'd be nice to know. Here are a few rant topics i could abuse right now:  1. Tampon commercials. 2. Those "anti-drug" commercials. 3. Racial Prejudices 4. Walmart sackers. 5. Old people that drive cars. 6. People that go to a fancy restaraunt and order *just* a salad. 7. Game companys that try to bring back dead characters. 8. Movies based on video games 9. Oklahoma. 10. Cats.  Pick one. Someone. I'll rant on it after i get back from ice skating.

      I hate goths. They all deserve to die. Every last one of them. But that's not the reason of my rant of the moment, the reason for this rant, is because 11-14 year olds of today are all little fuckups. And it's no one's faults but their own damn ingrateful selves. I'm watching some show about 11-14 year old kids talking about sex/truancy/depression/alcochol. WTF?!?!?!?!?? NO. KIDS THAT AGE SHOULD NOT BE DOING THOSE THINGS. CHRIST. Some chick just said "yeah, i first drank when i was in 5th grade. it helps you cut loose." WHAT THE HELL. NO. Kids your age should be eating candy bars, and experiencing sugar highs. WTF. I've only gotten drunk a few times. I'm in 10th grade. I didnt even THINK about alchohol in 5th grade. In 5th grade, I fell out of my desk and slammed my head into the floor. It sucked. That's all i can remember from that year. And that my teacher, mrs. skaggs, was a fat weirdo. Yeah. Earlier in the show, there was an 8th grader that had lost her virginity. NO. just, NO. DO NOT HAVE SEX AT THAT AGE. Jezus. Fuck. Cock. Shit. Ass. Gook. I'm really pissed. And i feel REALLY sheltered. VERY MUCH SO. Why havn't  I  ever experienced this peer pressure? Is it because i've always been smart, and went to different schools? Probably not. *on the show "put words to your tears, what's makin ya sad?"* CHRIST!!! FUCKING SLAP THE LITTLE BITCH. HE'S OUT DRINKING AND HAVING SEX. FOR FUCK'S SAKE. HE'S 12 YEARS OLD. YOU'RE A PISS-POOR PARENT, AND YOU DESERVE TO BE CRUCIFYED FOR YOUR HORRIBLE MISTAKE.  (Btw, i'm very sorry about the lack of proper english/gramatical skills, but...anger.)  [anger]

      Been a fool, been a clown lost my way from up and down and I know, yes I know And I see it in your eyes that you really weren't surprised at me at all not at all And I know by your smile it's you.  Don't care for me, don't cry let's say goodbye, Adieu. It's time to say goodbye, I know that in time it will just fade away, it's time to say goodbye.  I stand alone and watch you fade away like clouds high up and in the sky I'm strong and so cold as I stand alone Goodbye, so long, Adieu.  * Oh how I love you so, lost in those memories And now you've gone I feel the pain, feeling like a fool, Adieu  ** My love for you burns deep inside me, so strong Embers of times we had And now here I stand lost in a memory I see your face and smile  Diese Liebe von meinen fur mein Blutenherz....

      I'm not going ot argue the pointlessness of blogs in a blog, dev. That would be stupid and hypocritical. Let's talk about cats, and my extreme hate 4 them. Cats should all die, besides cait. Cait deserves to live, because she's my evil henchkitty. She terrorizes cats that are twice her size, and that deserves respect, f00. And her bad-ass name. Cait Sith. Nothing's better than that. Anways, cats really suck. They shit in your lawn, and then PRETEND to cover it up. You wont notice it for a while, but then it rains...That brings the smell of all 10000000 piles of cat excrement to life, and it is a bad time. Very bad time. Well, anyways, life is good. Things have been resolved, and...yeah...good times. Is anyone else going to natasha's party? Cause i dont want to go if i'll be the only one of "da krew" that shows up. That wouldnt be cool. Well, lemme know.

      Great. Just great. My dad probably has skin cancer, and my mom probably has some sort of gallbladder infection. She didnt think it was anything big, but my grandpa took her to the hospital, and it's serious. She lost 20 lbs in the past month, she's throwing up all the time, and grandma made it sound really serious. She sugar-coated it, i could tell, but i'm smarter than that. I could tell what she was trying to tell me. They're going up there on thursday,friday or saturday, and i want to go too. I told my dad, and he got angry. He said: "She hasnt been there for you. School is more important than this."  Shut the fuck up, dad. Seriously. You're a fucking asshole. My mom could be dying. I dont think that one of mr. coe's lectures is going to be that damn important. It'd be nice to see her one more time before she croaks, if she is going to.   I'm sorry for using humor, but I cant help it. It's integrated into my very being. I cant help it, at all. I guess it's a self-defense mechanism or something.   [...]

      You are  not likely  to feel particularly social today, dear Capricorn. You would be happiest at home with a good book, a good meal, and no communication from the outside world. Alas, such solitude is not always possible. You  may find  that you need to balance your need for isolation with your obligations to your colleagues. Part of your grumpiness  might be  due to a physical imbalance. Make it an early night tonight and you'll  likely  awake tomorrow with a renewed attitude.

VacantSilhouette: ...I dont exhist. StormsBelle: No way..  VacantSilhouette: Seriously! StormsBelle: ...  VacantSilhouette: We have this piece of paper that says "You can contact the drivers license fraud division at 425-2477 to inquire about your document" VacantSilhouette: (Can i put this chat in my blog?

It started with a little kiss, and then I got your number I called you up, and sure enough, we fell in love that summer Till your dad picked up the phone, did not say a word. Here's what he heard, You’re so sexual (who me?) Ahh! That's Right! Let’s get sexual (with me?) Ahh! All night. You’re so sexual (who me?) Ahh! That's Right! Let’s get sexual (with me?) Ahh! All night You were grounded from the telephone, but luckily we still had email. So I wrote you up and sure enough, you became my female. Till your dad went through the files and said we were dead. Here's what he read, You’re so sexual (who me?) Ahh! That’s Right! Let’s get sexual (with me?) Ahh! All night. You’re so sexual (who me?) Ahh! That's Right! Let’s get sexual (with me?) Ahh! All night You lost your connection, and I lost my girl. When dad chunked your computer, he tossed out my world. And if I could see you just one more time, this is what I’d say, You're so sexual (who me?) Ahh! That's Right! Let’s get sexual (with me?) Ahh! All night. You’re so sexual (who me?) Ahh! That's Right! Let’s get sexual (with me?) Ahh! All night  That's right.

I bought The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition for gamecube. For those non-cool people out there, it has: Legend of Zelda, Legend of Zelda II, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Is that cool, or is that cool?!??!?!?

      Ok, yesterday, after school, my dad and i went to my stepmom's office. on the way there, my dad decided that he didnt like traffic laws. He decided that "stoplights are stupid and pointless." It's common sense, he said, that someone should stop their car if they saw another car coming towards them. So, we made up the "Stupidity System". All other laws would be abolished but that one. There are 3 levels of this law.  I. Stupidity - I.E. Driving down the road, and cutting someone off. This would get a fine. Not punishable by death, but they could get a good spanking. II. Dumbassidity - I.E. Talking on a cell phone while driving. This would be a felony, and depending on the call, you could be sent to jail or a huge fine.  (Or, if they're being a JACKASS, then you can shoot them.) III. Idiocy - For those idiots out there, that brush their hair, eat breakfast, and talk on their cellphone, we dont do anything to them. We figure that they'll just kill themselves because they're that fucking dumb.  Only people that my dad and i have decided that are not stupid and at least semi-intelligent will be allowed to become stupidity officers. They would get free food wherever they went. And people would be required to throw money at them. Also, they all had the right to carry as much arms and munition as they wanted. And they had a "license to kill". They could kill anyone that they wanted as long as they were being a jackass. In any manner that the officer sees fit. Except for higher officers. That would be punishable by being abandoned on a tropical island in the carribbean. With no water/food.  [Work calls]

      You know what  I  want? There are a few things, but, one of them, is a zombie outbreak. I would LOVE for there to be a zombie outbreak. That would be fscking awesome. Seriously. I want a zombie outbreak. One where a few teachers become zombies, and I get to blow their heads off with a shotgun. It'd be so much fun to defend shephard mall. I would be on top of the mall, with a sniper rifle and two sawed-off shotguns. The sniper rifle for picking off any that i saw, and the two sawed-offs in case I missed one. Eat lead, zombie bitch. ka-blamo. No more zombie-head. No more zombie-head = no more zombie. It's just that easy. And dizzy's would give me free caffeine so that i could defend better. Sleeping would be done in astec, because of the fact that astec only has 2 insecure entrance points. The space place, and the front glass door. Those could be barracaded quite easily, though. and we would use many bottles of fabreeze, so that the zombies couldnt smell the people with no projectile weapons. If there WAS a "last stand" situation in the mall, i think it would be done at AOL. Seriously! Aol has very defendable positions. We could wait for a helicopter evac. And there could be a few thousand zombies assulting the place,  with about 100 people left in the building. It'd be FUN!  On another note, this morning, on the way to school, i thought of something rather odd. What if god had an orgasm? What would happen? Please, leave me a comment on what you think would happen. I think that he would accidentally negate all life in the universe.

      Well, that was interesting. I'm at home, it's about 3:50...and eric just destroyed the fan wire.  The bed's support thingi was sitting on the wire, and all of a sudden it cut through. Could be because the bed support thingi was sharp, i dont know. It exploded. It was all like *SPARK!!!!* and we were all like "OMG". And then we saw the wire. yeah, it lit up the whole room. Eric started to grab the wire, and i said "OMGWTF!!! YOU IDIOT!! UNPLUG IT FIRST." That would just make my day perfect. Watching eric be electocuted. Good times.

      Give credit where credit's due, biotches. The hanging thing was my idea. Mine.  For you non-knowing people, i suggested that we hang miss swagerty's knight from the ceiling, and leadership class did it. Cause i wouldnt have the chance to. Yah. Word to your mothers. There will be more pranks today, but i dont think any will top that. herm...what to do? I WANT to do something to stephens. He deserves it. But what? What could we do...  Here's MY ideas:  1. Get conatser to "fire" him on the basis of sexual harassment to otis chodosh. 2. Hang all of the lab stools to the ceiling. I have NO idea how we could accomplish this, because we dont have enough rope/time to do it. 3. Kill him. It wouldnt be funny, but it would be good. 4. Turn all of the tables upside-down. 5. Dont go to class. 6. Steal his chair.  ? Someone say something ?  Other pranks:  1. Dont come back after lunch. 2. Get the security guards to arrest the entire student body...they wouldnt do it, though. They hate us. 3. at 2:00,  everyone freeze. Just stop moving. Don't say a word, dont move a muscle. 4. Everyone go to the wrong class, and act emotionally hurt if they tell you to leave.

      Microsoft Invades Cuba Microsoft's plan to invade cuba and overthrow the government has succeeded. One Microsoft official said "It's a win-win situation. The US Government is happy and shuts up the DOJ while Microsoft institutes a monopoly within Cuba for everything from computer software to toilet paper. One more step closer to world domination. Heck, we could feed a whole development department for the cost of one developer's salary in the US. They may not know how to create an Operating System very well, but neither do our US developers."  Jigga jigga waht what?!??!?!

      I feel mentally raped. The damn ACT messed with me. I'm not saying that i'm tired, but i'm not saying that i'm not. I'm not saying that i'm sad, i'm not saying that i'm not.

      I found this on digital history while i was doing homework...  "In a single day at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, 100,000 British troops plodded across no man's land into steady machine-gun fire from German trenches a few yards away. Some 60,000 were killed or wounded. At the end of the battle, 419,654 British men were killed, missing, or wounded."  ...  Something's wrong here...  100,000 - 419, 654 = -319, 654  Where'd the 319, 654 troops come from?  were like, 1599 generations of babies born and killed in one day?!?!??!  I mean, if this were current, like last year, there probably would have been about 10,000 women in that force.  Back then, there were probably only about 200. Most of them were probably nurses....  30 x  1598.27 = 319, 654  I'm serious...if they were sending babies out on the battlefield, they must have been pretty desperate.  Let's take a moment of silence to remember the babies.  Silence is golden, so...  Babies = Silence Silence = Gold  Therefore,   Babies must be equivalent to gold.  Babies are golden?...Damn, i want to father some kids. Sounds profitable.  [Remember the babies, for they are bling.]

      This is a formal apology. And a war.  mowhohahahAHAHAHAHA. I'm sorry, but i cant help it. It's too much fun being a master of disguise. This is a declaration of WAR. Everyone VS. EVERYONE. I'm starting the war now. Everyone has to go around impersonating everyone else. Here are the rules from the genova convention: (Yes, i know it's jeneva or something, but, genova is from FF7.)  1. No personal, hurtful remarks. 2. Nothing that will embarass the other person. 3. If someone makes a written request for their harassing to stop (The word "shalamanga" will have to be in the request for it to be counted), then, the harassing of that person will stop. 4. Havvvveeee funnnnnN!!!!!  Leave a comment if you wish to participate.

      OMGWTFBBQ sweetness. I got a marshmallow gun. I forgot to tell ya'll. It's a gun..made out of pvc pipe...that shoots MARSHMALLOWS. At close range, it hurts. It's fun.

      oh...my...god...Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes is fucking awesome. It's the best game ever. It kicks splinter cell: pandora tomorrow (Single Player...maybe not multi)'s ASS. I love how they make the game trippy at random moments. Like, for this one boss, you had to switch your controller to socket two. And one time, this mind reading guy was like "You LOVE nintendo games, don't you, snake? Action games, even."...It's a fucking sweet game. Any game where you can hide in a box is sweet.

         That's so true. But after it says "I dont get viruses" it should say "*beeep* Hard drive erased". And the girls would spend $300 on a customer service call. to find out that they really do have a virus, and it IS going to erase their hard drive. They just wasted $300 on a service call. With no real service.  **Update**  I was told to say to change that generalization. So. Here.  1 or 2 girls would know that it was spam. IE: Dani/Diana. Maybe devin. Depending on how much caffiene/sugar she had.

      Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel  Touching you, touching me touching you, god you're touching me  I believe in a thing called love Just listen to the rhythm of my heart There's a chance we could make it now We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down I believe in a thing called love Ooh!  I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day You got me in a spin but everythin' is A.OK!  Touching you, touching me touching you, god you're touching me  I believe in a thing called love Just listen to the rhythm of my heart There's a chance we could make it now We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down I believe in a thing called love Ooh! Guitar!  Touching you, touching me touching you, god you're touching me  I believe in a thing called love Just listen to the rhythm of my heart There's a chance we could make it now We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down I believe in a thing called love Ooh!  "I believe in a thing called love" - The Darkness  That band is fscking sweet. That song reminds me of Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. Solid Snake falls in love, so I think...he seems to have a thing for meryl...Although he only subliminally shows it. He hasn't said that he actually is in love with her, but i can see it. When she got shot in both knees and her elbow and was lying on the ground bleeding, he was like "GODDAMNIT!!" and he was beating the wall. 'Cause he couldnt go save her, because he would have gotten shot in the head by Sniper Wolf. That chick is one hell of a sniper. Seriously. If  I  wasn't such a kick-ass sniper, then she would have pwnzed me. But i'm better. Ibelieveinathingcalledlove, JUSTlistentotherhythmofmyhearrrt.

      :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))  *massive grins*  I feel so very special. I did my homework. All of it. No one else but otis did. I'm teh r0x0rz.   *shoots otis*  STOP DOING THAT!!! *dadadada* FUCK YOU, OTIS.  I swear to god, i'm going to shoot you in the FACE. With a can of MACE. Windu stylee.  HAHAHAHAAHAHHHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAH.  It feel so great to have my homework done for once. I think i'll gloat again.  HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH.  I'm on the outside, i'm looking in. I can see through you, see your true colors, cause inside you're ugly, you're ugly like me.  HAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAA.  *looks around the room*   Hmm...there are like 2 people that are actually workin on their homework. Good job, 2 people. No one has their work done, yet everyone slacks off. Could this be the reason why everyone has bad grades? I think so.  *note*  I KNOW that dani's computer broke. So i'm not blaming her. Her computer is teh sux0rz. Sides,  she's working right now. Mowhoahahhaaha. She doesnt know that she's being WATCHED AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME!!!!!  *nother note*  I beat Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. My conclusion is...it's the greatest fucking action game ever. Adam and I are having a heated debate over who would win in a fight. Solid Snake, or Sam Fisher. I'm saying that Snake would win, Adam's saying that Fisher would win. DUH. Snake would fucking pwnz fisher's ass. Snake can dodge bullets. Can fisher? NO. Can Fisher flip out and kill everything around him? NO. Can fisher hide in the dark? YES. But that doesnt matter!!! Snake has night-vision goggles. In conclusion, snake pwnz fisher. End of story.

      Just a few comics i've read...  http://chugworth.com/comic.php?id=52  Silly conventional christians.  http://loserz.scribblekid.org/index.php?id=25  I agree with this...it's just silly. "I banged 5 (opposite sex)" Coming from a guy = Da man!!111one!!1!!! Coming from a gal = Omgwtfbbq slutzville!!!!11oneae!!!!!  What I say is, as long as there's protection, have fun. It's not like you're getting any younger. *winkwink*  http://loserz.scribblekid.org/index.php?id=29  Yeah. That's me. The guy. Cept, i put some water in my hair, then blast some spray gel stuff. I wish my hair was kina like his... ;_;  http://loserz.scribblekid.org/index.php?id=50  I concur. Silly people. What's wrong with either one of them? Pshh. I dont care. Their choice. If she wants to be a lesbian, and he wants to be gay, what's the problem? It's not like it personally affects  you .  Homework calls.

      www.superhornysluts has earned me 10 thousand bucks.  Well. I'm bored. And tired. Adam was being a fucker last night. It was 10:30, and for some odd reason, i was sleepy. So, i asked adam to put on headphones,  because he was playing Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow. I wasnt going to ask him to stop, because even I wouldn't have stopped playing. But, he mocked me. "blahbhabhaha!" in that stupid sassy tone. I asked again, he sassed again. I gave up, because i knew that i could get him back later.  My dad came in at like 11:00, because HE could hear it, too. Everyone that has been to my house, my door was closed, and HIS door was closed. That's how loud it was. It wasn't me just being an ass. It was adam always having to make it be "his way". Adam STILL wouldn't turn it down. My dad walked away, because he would have beat the shit out of adam, and no one wants that. He stopped playing at about 11:30. Fucker. He said "You dont always get it your way, nick." ...i never get my way. Adam's always has it his way. Always. Maybe i'll put a password on the comp tomorrow. That'd be nice.  Better yet, i'll give him a guest account. And the password will be "dumbfuck". Meh, he wont even see it coming. I really dont care what the folks do. It's my computer. I'll do whatever the fsck i want to do with it. He'll take away the xbox in revenge, i'm sure. Do i care? no. I have Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes. I havnt beat it on easy or hard yet. I'll do that. Maybe the little ass will decide that he'll spend some money, for once. he's the biggest cheapskate ever. He has about $500. For some reason, he doesnt ever spend it on anything. He constantly complains about the headset for the xbox, and yet he wont go spend the $20 for a new one.   Adam is an ass. He will pay for his crimes. ph33r m4 wr4th.

      DUDEE!! I just found my florescent jellyfish cd!!! IT'S AWESOME.   Side Note:  It seems as though the fabric of astecian aim-attendance is held together by me. When i get offline, everyone gets offline. I broke it. MowhoahahHHAHAHAHAHAHHAAH. Jeez I was only gone for what, 20 minutes?  Check, check it out, check, check it out Check, check it out, check, check it out Check, check it out, check, check it out Check it out I'm in line behind a barbizon And she really looks like one She says "Hi, I'm skin," And shows a whole lot But doesn't seem to have a whole lot Within, I'm small talk Blah, blah, blah, blah about the weather and all Because I'd love to stand here Another year, winter, spring, summer, fall Into pieces it pleases the eye It's nice to know that there are problems outside of my own I feel better, better Move to ten items or less Should I let her, let her, let me in front of her? Sure, I guess I'm close to checkout, she asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said "yes" without listening "Oh, come on, be honest." I'm close to checkout, she asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said, "Yes, and that's a promise!" "Oh, come on, be honest." Be, be honest, be, be, be honest Be, be honest, be, be, be honest I have five items in the waiting asylum Take everybody's burdens, let's pile 'em up On the counter, call it a conveyer belt And as I look around I see a wanna-be dad using his belt On his screaming baby, a baby, oh baby The constellation on her face said he did the same to his lady Ten thousand maniacs asked the question But it's way too late, he made a lasting impression I wish it wasn't so, I wish it wasn't so But I'm not supposed to impose family values, you know The sale of the century wasn't meant to be like this But how can you resist the madness? I'm so glad it's almost my turn Only one lady away from the freedom I yearn for But before you get excited, She's gotta check the writing, I'm sorry to announce that the check is gonna bounce I feel better, better Move to ten items or less Should I let her, let her, let her me in front of her? Sure I guess I'm at the checkout She asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said "yes" without listening "Oh, come on, be honest." I'm at the checkout, She asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said, "Yes, and that's a promise." "Oh, come on, be honest." Be, be honest, be, be, be honest Be, be honest, be, be, be honest Honestly, We are moderately moving Situation slowly is improving I find the Percy Faith on the P.A. Is sort of soothing Collect my change and I jet Then I'm cruising Check, check it out, check, check it out Check, check it out, check, check it out Check, check it out, check, check it out Check it out Wandering around looking for my car I'm amazed at the maze Who even knows where you are? Who knows why that's a cart resting in the dent it made? Another car waiting for our places to trade I wish it wasn't so, I wish it wasn't so I wish I was in the distance and heading to home base And now the race to red lights begin When the convertible girl slows down to let me in I feel better, better, like as if I was blessed Should I let her, let her, let me in front of her? Sure, I guess I roll down the window, she asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said "yes" without listening "Oh, come on, be honest" I roll down the window, she asks, "Are you the walrus?" I said "Yes, and that's a promise!" "Oh, come on, be honest." Be, be honest, be, be, be honest Be, be honest, be, be, be honest  "Are you the walrus" - Furthermore  This song is teh r0x0rz. Even if it takes me back to the good old days (sarcasm) of cha. It's just a feel-good cd. And melting vinyl makes one's head hurt. And i've REALLY got to show it to mr. stephens. He'd rock out to it.

      Great. 2 hours REPHRASING A GOD DAMN PAPER. If I dont make somewhere near a 90% on this thing, i'm going to flip my lid. I'm serious. Every god damn student at astec puts in hours of homework, on one or two assignments, and we get SHIT for grades. We all deserve "A"s for sheer EFFORT. I mean, wtf? We do exactly as they tell us, and we get horrible grades on them. Maybe it's not us? Did you self-righteous fuckers ever think of that? We try, god damnit. I TRY. I dont know if everyone tries as hard as I, but, damnit. I deserve an A for effort. The only class that I fully understand is Geometry. I have a 78 in there. And you know what? 9th graders understand that damn class better than i do. Swagerty's been being a bitch to me lately. Coe trys, but he cant teach worth shit without any textbooks. That's not his fault. That's deskin and her 5 car's fault. Christ. You do not need 5 cars. You do not need a Z3 when your damn school has the funding of a brothel in an amish community. I'm probably going to get something near a 60 on this retest. You know why? Because effort doesn't matter. All that matters, is sheer genetic luck. If you are born with the proverbial "smarts", you succeed in life. If you are born with the intelligence of a stump, you'll end up with a job flipping burgers until you are 50-70 when you decide to start leeching the government for money. Then your salary will double, because apparantly, uncle sam is the wallet of the entire fucking nation.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and have a nice night.  Fuckers.     Crawling in my skin without a sense of confidence...consuming, confusing....crawling in my skin, without a sence of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take...there's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface...Consuming, confusing..this lack of self-control, I fear is never ending..controlling, I can't seem to find myself again...My walls are closing in...without a sense of confidence I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take I've felt this way before So insecure...

      I had a long rant...now it's gone. Fucking sbc dsl. It was basically about how much i hate myself right now. And astec. And most of the people there. Life sucks, love sucks, i wish the dying part would come sooner. I'm not going to kill myself. Don't worry. Suicide is entirely selfish.  I actually tried, for once, to get my assignments in on time, and, i get worse grades. Damnit. I just dont understand. Every day, i feel more ignorant than the one before.  Yet, i put on a good face, and pretend that life's grand, and try to cheer everyone else up that is around me. I want to go to classen, but, my grades suck too much. I could  try  to get in on drama or tenor sax...but i dont want to go there for vpa. I'm not an artsy person. I would LOVE to learn how to play a few bebop songs on the tenor sax though...  I'm going to stop whining now. I hate it when i whine. I hate it when anyone whines. I'm the type of person that doesn't believe in whining. I believe that everything can be changed. My belief system is crumbling. Everything that i thought i knew, is wrong. All wrong. I guess i'll go try to make up a test, to make a worse grade than before, obviously. Meh, figures. I was just starting to feel good about myself, too. What with (thinking) that i had good grades, (thinking) that my father actually liked me for once.  All that is gone now. I feel like shit. I feel like a worthless pimple on the ass of society.   [Standing in line to see the show tonight, and there's a light on....heavy glow....by the way, i tried to say i'd be there, waiting for....Dani's the girl who's singing songs to me, beneath the marquee, of our souls, by the way, i'd try to say i'd be there...waiting for....you....]

      You guys HAVE to answer this question.  What's better? Making out, or french kissing?  In case you don't know, i'll define them.  Making Out - A lot of kisses  French Kissing - A really long kiss with tongue.  I'm not being a pervert, honestly! I just want to know. Humor me.   Leave a comment.

      Khrushchev just wanted to go to disneyland. Why wouldnt they let him go to disneyland? He knew that he was risking his life. he just wanted to ride pirates of the carribbean,  or thunder mountain! Just that incident, if he had been allowed to enter, could have ended the cold war. The russians would have become happy if they were allowed into disneyland. Khrushchevland. heh.

      *shakes head* My sister is so silly. She tried to stop her bike with her bare FEET,  ON CONCRETE, and her bike pedal sliced into the back of one of her heels. She was in the emergency room for 5 hours, and they came to the conclusion that she ripped or tore the achilles tendon of her left heel. Silly sister. Stopping is for breaks. Not feet.

      Today, in the omgwtfbbq news:  My dad bought a Xterra. I got home like 30 minutes ago...and he just walked in and showed me some keys. I walked to the driveway, and there was a "warthog"(halo) brown xterra. It's sweet. Fuck the ptcruiser.  Dani and I went to the museum of art. It was...? Werd, yo. The cafe was the funniest part. I swear that there was white stuff floating around in my drink...And they had bread that has a concrete covering. And the people there did not want dani and i to leave. We got done...a LONG time before the check got there. an hour seems like an accurate amount of time. I went to dani's house. It was fun...except for my lack of hearing. Damn you, chel. Don't make dani make those noises. It realllllly hurts my ears. Heh. Anyways, later on, chel came over, and we watched POTC. That movie got better. I don't know how, but i think it's a decent movie now. Could be grammatically. Could be emotionally. No one knows.   Today has been the best day...all this year. I got a Mitsubishi and my dad got an Xterra.

My uncle just bought it. I'll have to share it with adam, but he's only 14. So, it'll be mine for a year or so.  I guess i'll fix it up this summer or somethin.     ph33r m4 jap wh33lz!!!  that's what it'll look like....  i have a car!!   VROOOOOOOM.

Far more shocking than anything i ever knew...right on cue *GUITAR WAIL* Cant stop, addicted to the shindig, top cop, he says i'm gonna win big, choose not the life of imitation, distant cousin to the reservation, defunkt the pistol that you paid for. (Can't stop - RHCP)  Ladiladlalalal.  I'm still on an Xterra high right now. I still havn't ridden in it. But it's fucking sweet. I SHOULD be bored. But i'm pleasantly satisfied.     "Dani's got herself a new job, but she wishes that she had the old one.  Now it seems her dreams have shattered  And all of her pretty friends have scattered, now that dani's underpaid.  Oh dani, don't go crazy."  Don't do it, dani. Don't work at wal-mart. I'll....I'll...Well, i can't think of a bad enough threat for this situation, but it will be bad. Really bad. If you work at wal-mart. There's gotta be SOMETHING else you can do. Walk out onto sunnylane, and hold up a sign that says "suck for a buck" and in little letters at the bottom put (at soul calibur II) Can you imagine the $$ you'd get? Or a "free blow" sign. and in little letters at the bottom (with the full payment of college tuition). I wouldn't mind! At least you wouldn't be working at wally world.  For the Commonwealth! Yeeeeehaaaawwww! For the Swarm! Ultor! D'ni!  If you don't understand, then you've gotta believe, there's too much of you, there's not enough of me. There's not enough of me. yeahhhhahah, whooaooaaoaoaoaoa. *guitar riff* (Not Enough - 3 Doors Down)  Well, my left pinky is starting to hurt from typing, but...yaeaahr. I want my double park season pass.   *remembers* Oh yeah, sorry about messing up your bed, dani. *remembers* That starry blanket was pretty comfy, though. *remembers* Those purple spikey things...they haunt me... *remembers* Gir and the Dog do not need to have sex. Ever. Badbadbad. I KNOW that gir's head looks like a phallic object, but you don't have to treat it as such. *remembers*  Grammatical. *remembers* That shelf kept on beating my skull. It was painful.  *remembers* "...this place is not secure." "?" "I could be sniped...from anywhere. *ducks*"   *ROCK OUT*

      Dissection = School Violence.  "Hey, you!  Dissection is gross and hurts animals. Frogs are snatched from ponds and rivers. Pigs come from slaughterhouses. Dogs and cats come from pounds and come from "free to a good home" ads.  You have the RIGHT not to dissect! Stand up for yourself and the animals and choose to refuse!  Take action! - Find out today if you have to dissect. - Let your teacher know, politely and in writing, that you will not be dissecting because you believe that dissection is cruel. Offer suggestions for alternatives, like computer simulations and models. - PETA's got your back: call or e-mail if you need help finding alternatives or just the right words to say. - Use these stickers to get the word out. (which i am...lol)  You're not alone. Thousands have refused to dissect. Who likes to dissect? "In 9th gade, in biology class, we had the usual dissection of fetal pigs, and i took the remains of that home, and kept the skeleton of it, an di started branching out to dogs and cats." said infamous serial killer and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer. Yikes! Get an A in science without the usual slice and dice. Choose to refuse, and don't settle for an F. Nobody has to die for you to get good grades. It's your right.  Yours truley,   The Frendly Anti-Dissection Brigade at PETA"  Brought to you by the People for the Eating of Tasty Animals, lol.

      Ooo...lack of long posts recently. Oh well. Just saw slc punk. it was cool. Very cool. That guy is my favorite actor. Matthew Lewaer or somethin. He's cool.   Now, since i'm too lazy to retype it, my newspaper article!  Wheeeee! Rant Time: Video Game Violence. By Nick Petschel  Ok, let me start this rant by saying this: I am an avid geek and a gamer. I love technology. I'm the guy that you see at his computer at 2 'o clock in the morning playing Unreal Tournament on his customized pc. I'm the guy that would pass up a date for a LAN party. Yeah. I'm   that   much of a loser. Yet somehow, I've still got a girlfriend and somewhat of a social life. Yep. Good times. Anyways, What really makes me mad, is when stodgy old politicians blame school shootings, murders, rapes, and stabbings on video games, more specifically, first-person shooters. Ok, look, just because the two guys that killed all of those people at columbine played quake, does not mean that all gamers are violence-prone crazies. I'm a relatively sane person, most of the time, but, when I start up a game of Savage, I'm just that, a savage. You can take all of your problems out on "Ghastly_Freak" or "ur_m0m". For me, at least, video games give me a place to vent so that I don't walk around beating people up. Video games don't get mad when you don't lend them a dollar. Video games don't give you an F on a paper you spent 4 hours creating. Video games are there when you need them, and they are easily packed away when you don't. If you get mad at a game, you can turn it off. There's nothing stopping you. Gamers are usually more sane than non-gamers. Non-gamers don’t really have a place to vent except to a friend, which can be offended, or a psychiatrist, which cost major blingage, or to a complete stranger. Most strangers get kind of freaked out when you walk up to them and say "Hi, my name's Nick. I hate my teacher/parents/boss. I want to rip out her/his spine and use it as a golf putter." Instead of doing that, you can turn on your xbox/ps2/gc/pc, double click/slip in your favorite game, and take your wrath out on the nearest object in the game. Just because you enjoy shooting birds with a desert eagle doesn't mean that you will take a shotgun to work and splatter your boss' brains all over the wall. Here are a few people that are gamers, and here is what they have to say:  Kacy Southerland - "Super Mario- The original game rocked, and you can't try to "update" an old school classic."  Will Hodgson - "Tetris is the sport of the gods!"  In conclusion, video games keep the madness off the streets. Censor our games any more, and you'll (essentially) let the crazies out. Don't be dumb. Make the right choice. Save the Lemmings.   (CHRIST that took forever to edit out all of the ' and ")

      See spot rock, yes indeed. The music wasn't exactly my type, for the most part, but i thought grits rocked, and so did pillar, and 12 stones. skillet kina bored me...and i can't remember the name of the first band for the life of me. It was rockable though. So, i did. I rocked. I jumped around. I got in a mosh. So, tomorrow, if i come to school looking like a zombie, you will all know why.

      ? blogger's pmsing, at least on MY comp... ?  anyways.  VacantSilhouette: guess what?' VacantSilhouette: last night, chris, charlie, michael, nick, me, daphne, and diana almost got dead. StormsBelle: Wha? VacantSilhouette: Ok, we were walking down military ave. on the way back to chris' house from the park (we got bored, and walked to the park at like 12:00 AM). StormsBelle: ... VacantSilhouette: This guy, all of a sudden, slammed on his breaks, got out of his car, and started screaming "DO YOU HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM!??!?!?!" at us. VacantSilhouette: we all said "no..." in unison VacantSilhouette: and this went on for about 30 seconds, then he got back in his car. VacantSilhouette: he drove a block further, and then he SLAMMED on his breaks again, and he got out, and he screamed a lot louder, and a lot more! VacantSilhouette: the same thing! StormsBelle: wtf? StormsBelle: that's crazy.. VacantSilhouette: me, chris, michael, and chuck all responded "no sir!" VacantSilhouette: i guess he finally thought that we were telling the truth or something. VacantSilhouette: here are possible outcomes if we DIDN'T manage to make him stop his anger:  VacantSilhouette: 1. He didn't have a gun - Me, charlie, chris, michael, and nick beat the shit out of him when he attacks us. StormsBelle: lol StormsBelle: I don't wanna know the other one..  VacantSilhouette: 2. He has a gun. We all run like sissies screaming away trying not to die. StormsBelle: lol StormsBelle: never mind I did.. heh..  VacantSilhouette: 3. He has a knife. We throw diana at him. StormsBelle: LOL StormsBelle: that's horrible VacantSilhouette: okie doke. i'm too lazy to retype this, so, i'm posting it in my blog. Laziness.  charlie and i came to the conclusion that there were a few possible reasons why he did that...  1. Charlie was wearing a blue shirt. 2. Chris and Michael were wearing red shirts. 3. He was drunk. 4. He was on dope. 5. He was on dope and drunk. 6. He thought we flipped him off or something. 7. He thought that we were crazy japs and that we were trying to eat his brain.  Hold me down, aveda. Hold me down, it feels so right. All i know is what i've been told.  oh yeah, and that thingimabob on the back of michael's ear? Yeah. Chuck was trying to tackle michael, and he popped it. There was blood all over michael's neck. It was funny. I said that he should just take a knife, and cut the skin off before it formed another thingimabob. He didn't listen to me...oh well. Chuck can pop it again or something.

      69 things to do instead of being depressed  1. Play FFVII 2. Shoot yourself in the head. 3. Shoot Mr. Stephens in the head. 4. Play Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 5. Become a gamer 6. Download some pr0n. 7. Get some forearm exercise. 8. Buy kleenex. 9 Watch Chappelle's show. 10. www.sexylosers.com 11. www.buzzcomix.net 12. www.worldsex.archives.com 13. Watch Friday the 13th 14. Play Resident Evil 15. Go see van helsing on friday. 16. Watch LOTR. All of it. In a row. No more depression. 17. Make fun of the matrix: reloaded and revolutions. 18. Buy a life sized pillow of your favorite actor/actress. 19. Find a vibrating sheep of DOOM. 20. Kill Kacy Southerland if she doesn't give me the Movies of the 1920s 21. Read MT. All of it.  22. Read LG. All of it. 23. Go find "Super Senshi Soldiers" on the 'net. It is scary. Coo power rangers. 24. Steal 'fluffy' 25. Go see "godsend". that'll scare the depression right out of 'ya. 26. Watch kill bill: vol 1 and see if you can count the gallons of blood that are spilled. 27. Tell chris that *something that he believes...anything* is wrong. 28. Get in an argument with dani and/or stephen. You'll never win. It's impossible.

It doesn't matter if you have proof that you're right, they don't care! 29. Find a new blogskin,  because, apparantly, my blogskin is the stupid.  30. plan a robbery of nvidia 30. Forget how to count. 52. turn into a zombie. 32. eat your face. 69. 69

      'nother one bites the dust...  Correction: we have 3 kittens.  2 of them have died. Upper respiratory disease...We didn't get to em in time, and they got sick...and...yeah...We have 3 left that are healthy.  Grand total of cats that have died in the house (to my knowledge): 4  Yeah. I walked into the living room, dad was asleep, and i noticed that one of the kittens didn't seem to be breathing. I poked it....and moved it a bit...and nothin. I looked at it's chest for a minute...nothin. Conclusion: Dead as a doornail.

      Looks like they are all going to die. I guess they got some kind of disease from being under that bush or something. The two that are left are breathing wierdly. like ehh--U*HHGHHHHHHH. SO. They're gonna die. Victoria feels like she failed them...especially since it's mother's day. Fun times.

But instead of "cactus diary" i would put "cactuar's blog"  Cause cactuar is kick-ass. and that thingi looks like a cactuar.  Or this one  http://www.blogskins.com/apply.php?sid=8852&action=Preview  but with a differrent pic. I want a smaller blog. This one's too big.  Ok, it's settled.

I didn't complain about the us history test today, you bunch of whiners. damnit, don't whine about that! it SAID to write an essay, so write a damn essay. stfu. All you need to do, is bs it. as long as you have a few facts, I.E. Affair, Lies, and Moral coruptitity, then you win. game over.

      Hah. despite CERTAIN people's "you need your OWN notes" yellings, i still think i did pretty damn good on that test. You know why? Because i rock. I found out that otis and i both said that the verdict was just, based on the fact that the defendant's entire arguement was destroyed when that one guy confessed to knowing about the killings. Harrrr. I win. Now all i need to do is get a decent grade on that slide thingi in chem, and i'll pass all of my classes.

      I feel better now. Got some things straightened out. Thought that someone was one of  them  but, got that cleared up. Life is good now, for the most part. Most of the new problems are being taken care of, and some of the old ones are starting to be worked out. For example, the problem of having to live with  the beast . I'm starting to educate him to the better thins of life, i.e. - Resident Evil Outbreak. We're going in on it together this weekend. And adam and i have both heard rumors from the folks of moving. To a house. With bedrooms for the both of us. Happy Day! What we all want, i think..., is for adam and i to have two BEDrooms. With perhaps nothing more than a bed, a dresser, and a closet. The two bedrooms would be like so. x()x. The "x"s would be our rooms, and the "()" would be the bathroom. The rest of the floor of the house, would be a big room with a sofa, our tv and gaming systems, and the comp. Good, no? It works. Assuming that we can have a floor...I'm not trying to be a rich mofo here, really i'm not. Top floor of the house would be adam and I's...bottom floor would be the folk's room, dad's office, victoria's office, the living room, the dining room, and the kitchen. And their respective bathrooms. Life would be good then. Very good.

      I wrote this for the newspaper...  Rant – School Uniforms By Nick Petschel  	Have you ever wondered what exactly the purpose of the uniform was? I have. It doesn't make any sense to me. People can say "it takes less time to get ready", and "it helps the non-rich kids be able to be popular because of their clothes". You know what? I don't believe that at all.  "It takes less time to get ready" No. Completely wrong. On Fridays, it takes me about 10 minutes to get ready. On Monday-Wednesday, it takes me about 15 minutes to get ready, and on Thursdays it takes me about 20 minutes to get ready. Why? Because I have to FIND the uniform. I don't have the $$ to go out and buy clothes for every day of the week. So, I have to wash them every other night. I usually end up laying it around somewhere, because I have homework to do, and I can't be bothered with clothes. On Thursdays, It takes me 20 minutes for basically the same reason, but I also have to make sure it looks decent.  "It helps the non-rich kids be able to be popular despite their financial situation". That may have been true in the 90's and 80's, but not now. You know what the "fashion" is now??!?? Grunge. Punk. You can get most of those clothes by going to a thrift store.  Now, it may just be me, but I think that the ASTEC uniform looks horrible. Grey, black, tan, and red. We all look like a bunch of losers. Idiots. I would NOT mind if ASTEC had a suit-like uniform. Guys wear suits, girls wear dresses. They look fine. They look spiffy. Our uniform makes us all look like Goths. That's another thing that makes me mad. When certain people tell other certain people that they should not wear gothic clothing. They make those people wear all black/grey the rest of the week, why not on Fridays? Our entire lives, we have been encouraged to be unique, and individual, but then, the dress code/uniform was invented. We all look the same. We all have to wear patches. You know who else made someone else wear patches? The Nazis. The Nazis made the Jews wear patches. I've heard the "it makes us be able to spot you in a crowd" excuse, too. That makes no sense. ASTEC is a small school. Everyone knows everyone. Everyone has at least SEEN everyone else. Make us all wear hats. ASTEC hats. Or, bright pink hats. You could spot someone wearing a bright pink hat in a crowd. Perhaps even easier than the grey/black uniform. Heaven forbid we go somewhere at night wearing the grey-black. Everyone would disappear!!! Another thing, have any of the uniform committee members been made to wear these atrocities?!??! We live in Oklahoma. It gets to around 100 degrees in the summer. 100 degrees + all black/grey outfit + humidity = DEATH FOR ASTEC STUDENTS. Why don't you just make our uniform all white? Oh. Wait. There was another group of people that had all white uniforms.  Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, I rest my case. Uniforms are Silly, Pointless, Impractical, Boring, Ugly, Hot, A Hassle, A Bother, A Hindrance, and a general problem.   Viva la resistance!!!  Long, no?...yeah. Long. And hard. mm...long and hard...

      blarggh! sickie-poo. so tired. tired of having sex. just playin. That'd never happen. Unless i started to get sore. Then i'd be tired. Anyways. I'm seriously tired I slept for about 4 hours...and i'm still sleepy and i have a headache. Probably due to the fact that adam is a dumbfuck. Why now?  He left spilled milk all over the carpet in our room. It smelled like shit. He wasn't doing anything about it. When i got here, and opened the door, i almost vomited and died. I found the source of the smell, then put on ye olde gasmask and took it out. The room smells better now. goodtimes.

       Jessica sashays over to Mr. Acme's table and cuddles up behind him, pinching and rolling his cheeks as he smiles with satisfaction. After removing his handkerchief and rubbing his head playfully with it, she also works her way over to Eddie's lap. There, she reaches her fingers inside his trenchcoat, removes his fedora, seductively tantalizes him, sits on his table with her statuesque chest bursting out in front of him, leans closer to him, and pulls his necktie toward her as she finishes her song:  I'll give you something good if you tell me what movie that's from. Otis is exempt from this.

      I'll have the link to the pictures up here in a bit, once david gets back from...wherever. I made a few backgrounds. 3...otis saw one...no one's seen the other two. I really like the pink triangle. I was listening to the song, and it struck a few chords...and i said to myself, "I've never seen any good weezer backgrounds. I'll make my own." So, i made it. I think it's pretty damn good. I might make a pink triangle blog layout...I think it'd be a big hit on blogskins. I kina zombied out once i got home, doing nothing but concentrating on psd...i'm tired...tired of school...tired of a lot of things. I really wish things were like they were last year. We were all dumbasses...and we didn't care. There wern't any "judges" like there are now. Next year will be better with most of the people gone. It'll give me a chance to concentrate on my work...i'm sorry if any of the "judges" take offense to this, but, i felt like saying it. I havn't posted anything that related to my feelings, and that's what journals are for, right? Oh well.    Let me know the truth, let me know the truth...

      Bright Eyes "Sunrise, Sunset"   Sunrise, sunset. Sunrise, sunset. Swiftly go the days. Sunrise, sunset. You wake up, then you undress. It always is the same. A sunrise and a sunset. You are lying while you confess, keep trying to explain. The sunrise and the sun sets you realize and then you forget what you have been trying to retain. But everybody knows that it is all about the things that get stuck inside of your head, like the songs your roommate sings or a vision of her body as she stretches out on your bed. She raised her hands in the air and asked you, When was the last time you looked in the mirror? Because you have changed. Yeah, you have changed. Sunrise, sunset. You are hopeful and then you regret. The circle never breaks. With each sunrise and sunset there is a change of heart or address. Is there nothing that remains? For a sunrise or a sunset. You are manic or you're depressed. Will you ever feel ok? It's a sunrise and sunset, your lover is an actress. Did you really think she would stay? For a sunrise and sunset. You are either coming or you just left but you are always on the way. Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet. They are really just the same. To the sunrise and the sunset. The master and his servant have exactly the same fate. It's a sunrise and a sunset. From a cradle to a casket. There ain't no way to escape. The sunrise and the sunset. Hold your sadness like a puppet, just keep putting on the play. But everything you do is leading to the point where you just won't know what to do. And at that moment you may laugh but there is someone there who will be laughing louder than you. So it's true, the trick is complete. Now you have become everything you said that you never would be. You're a fool!  You're a fool! Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset. The sunrise and the sunset. Sunrise, sunset. Go home to your apartment and put the cassette in the tape deck and let that fever play. Sunrise, sunset. Where are you Arienette? Where are you Arienette?   For a sunrise or a sunset. You are manic or you're depressed. Will you ever feel ok?

      Rar! I have determined what my social stereotype is: Indie. I am indie. I am SO indie. Rock on! Listens: The Flaming Lips, The Coral, Weezer. Weezer kina fits, but fits more into geek. So i am an Indie Geek. harrr! Now all i need to do is buy some jeans, and i will be indie. rarrrrr!    i am an indie snob!      urlLink  How indie are you?  test by  urlLink ridethefader   You're just too cool for school, aren't you? You're pretty narrow minded  and opinionated with regards to music (and probably most other things  as well). But you're allowed to be, because you really  are  better  than everyone else. You take pride in obscurity.  You probably prefer vinyl too, you elitist bitch.     Biznitch. Fear my music that you havn't even heard of. *shakes fist* All the kick-ass bands? Yeah. I liked them before they were cool. Now I have to find new music, you fucktards.

      Michael is  dumb.   That's all i've got to say about that.     Fear me and my force resistance.   Reasons why he's an idiot as of now:  1. I knew that michael wouldn't resist the chance of free ice cream. So I let him have the ticket. 2. I let him convice me to go to the middle school.  3. He didn't say anything. At all. I did the talking. and I lied.
