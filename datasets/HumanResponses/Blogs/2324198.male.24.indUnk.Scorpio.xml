      Ok, here's the photos:   Firstly the one where although the flower is in the centre of the viewfinder it's clipped on the actual photo. A  urlLink Flower   Next the photo would have been so much better if the frog hadn't jumped out of shot just before I pressed the button. The  urlLink Missing Frog   And lastly, one I find quite interesting, it's the texture of on an old pine tree growing in my parents garden (I planted the tree in about '87).  urlLink Tree Texture   I sound like I'm actually ranting but I'm not, I'm just not really sure how to get the best out of the camera I have, or even if it can do what I'm trying to. It is fun though, if the pictures look good or not, it's just good to be outside doing something.  Right, back to the kitchen :)

      I've been out and about with my camera again today, not really as successful as before; I must admit that looking at shutterline and chatting to Rachael last night has inspired me. Unfortunately my lack of knowledge, my camera and the wildlife had other ideas.  I've got a couple of good photos, but I think I need a better camera to take photos of small things (I was trying to take a photo of this ant on this flower). Once you get closer than about 50cm, what appears on the photo is only the top left corner of what appears in the view finder. I will have to read the manual and try again :)  My parents are trying to tell me I'd be better off with a cheaper or older car, why they feel it's any of their business I don't know, still, gives them something to moan about I guess.  Well I better be going, roast beef won't cook itself :) I'll be back on here again later; whatever you're up to, hope you're enjoying yourself! :D

      Went out last night about 10:30pm in the hope of taking some good night time photos, in reality it was just way too dark so ended up just doing for a walk. It's quite nice to walk around here, I will probably go out again tonight, but a little earlier, try and get some more photos :)  I've been up about an hour, have no real plans for today, after all it is a bank holiday. There's quite a few things I probably should be doing, but in reality they can all wait. From what I can hear most of the people down the street are doing DIY, I suppose I should do some of the jobs on the house. Nah, I'll have a few days off and do them :)  Right, that's enough rambling for this morning, back later!

      Taken from a farm track about a mile out of town,  urlLink Sunset . I'm going to put a few more pictures up later, just need to find a good script for creating a gallery and thumbnails.

      It's amazing how much better you can feel for a nice cold shower; it's quite sunny outside, but quite windy; which is nice, I hate it when it's too hot!  Have fixed the link to Rache's Blog, I put the picture in and forgot to link it, how silly is that!! I'm going to upload some photos later, no really, I am!  Well it's lunchtime so I'm off to find some food :)

      Well I though I was over this stupid cold, but no, it's still hanging around. I feel worse than ever today. I have only just work up (due to not much sleep). Not sure what I'm doing today yet, might go back to bed :)  Went out for a walk last night and have taken some more pictures, the sky was really strange, it was very dark, but with the tops of the clouds glowing orange. Providing the pictures are ok, I'll upload one in a bit.  That's about it for now, think I'm going to have a play with this template, try and sort out a few more links!

      Really, was in Tesco shopping at 8am, it's way too early. But at least we have food again now. I've been back home for a bit, just chilling out really, I'll probably do some work in a bit, well, maybe :)  Yesterday afternoon I watched Cruel Intentions 2, well what can I say about it really, apart from ripping off half the script (yes, seriously) from Cruel Intentions, with a lot of bad acting, an ending that looks like the got to the last day of filming and thought 'fuck, we've only got the set for another 24 hours, oh right, let's film this'.  Who knows, perhaps I'm missing something, I thought the first film was excellent, this one, well I guess a 4/10 but once you start watching it you'll watch it to the end. I notice that there is a 3rd Curel Intentionsm, I might watch that, but I really expect it can only get worse! It really is a shame as the first one was so good, that they should follow it up with such a poor sequal. If you've not watched the first one, watch it now!  Well I'm going to go and get on with something now, haven't decided what; I got myself some Irn Bru while at Tesco, I'll post my thoughts on that when I've tried it :)

      I know, I know, well i've sorted out my car insurance, I can't do anything about my lease car as I'm waiting for some paperwork to come back, so I sat down at the computer, and what happens, well before you know it i've got a developement system open and i'm writing software again :)   Still i've done a lot of things to day that I wanted to do, most of the paperwork has been sorted out, i've order all the bits i need to finish off the computers i've got here, so you see what else is there to do :)  I've been looking for a good php script I can use for the gallerys on my persoanl website, i've got about 300 or so photos  i'd like to upload, most of them are just the town and villages around here; i've always had a bit of an interest in photography but until i got this digial camera i haven't really been that botherd, but it's easy now (well i mean no hassle of films and things) :)  Listerning to some tunes I haven't heard for ages, currently 'Shed Seven - Chasing Rainbows', which is a class tune, you just have to remember to turn it up loud :)  Well that's enough here for now, i'm off to find a drink, and see how many times I get distracted before i get back here :)

      Serously i'd great been here this morning; i've done quite a bit of work, and have been chatting to Rache on msn, have setup another website on adwords, and have even worked through a week backlog of email.    I'm off to find some food now, but i'll return here shortly and start working my way through the pile of paper that has collected around my desk.  Even though i'm off work today I have just emailed the admin manager to see if she's got the info i need for me car :)  Right, number 1 priority is food!

      Well i've got the day off today, but for some strange reason I still got up at going to work time; my plans for today, well mostly to be sat here working on my website.  Apart from that I'll probably eat something, and might go into town (have to stuff to post).  There is something I was going to do today, but i've completly forgoten what it was, i'm sure i'll remember it later!  Right off to find some food :)

      Well I'm got tomorrow of work, I don't feel to good and the office is a horrible place to be when you feel crappy (it has very dry air, and not natural light, not exactly the best for a cold).  So the plans for tomorrow, it's going to be a day of sorting out, tidying, and working on my websites.  I'm not going to write any software as that's all I ever seam to do, it's a day off :)

      It's thursday afternoon and I'm at home, I went to work this morning, but feeling crappy (damm cold), and a stack of things to do at home pusuaded me to have the afternoon off.  It's fun been at home during the day, it quiet and you can get on with your won thing, which as your probably guess is working! :)  Isn't it amazing the amount of post you can get in a week, I've got piles of things that need to be filed, and lot's of stuff to order and install for people; I guess the thought of getting a new car, and the realisation of been Â£450 worse off each month is making me think about doing a bit more work.  I still have a lot of junk around here I want to sell, perhaps putting it on ebay can be a job for the weekend.  Unfortunatly since my activities over the past few days have entailed nothing more than working, sleeping, and talking on msn, I haven't really got a great lot to say for myself; i'm working on my website a bit more now, so that should make an appearance shortly, I've been saying for years i'd do it (registered the domain about 3 years ago), but haven't got round to it yet.  Well I better get on, I just can't believe how quickly the afternoon has gone!

      I have just taken a Peugeot on another test drive, this time with the gear box in sports, and well, it's a different car, infact i'll even go as far to say it's as quick as my merc, and holds the road better, the decision has been made :)  Other than that I have little to report, other than I feel crappy, damm summer colds; still it's all a excuse to relax at home, if i feel like this tomorrow morning I might have the day off!  yes really :) hehe

      Seriously I was actaully late for work today, only about 2mins and only for about the 5th time in 5 years, so I guess that's not to bad really.  I think i'm getting a cold, I have a sore throat and feel a bit crappy, i'm not usually the kind of person that gets ill often, so hopefully this cold will go in a few days.    I went to look at the Renault yesterday, can't really say that I was impressed with it, going to have another look at the Peugeot tonight afterwork, want to see what it drive like with the gearbox in 'sports' mode.    Pretty much had a night off from sitting in front of the computer last night, I figure yes I am busy, and I have got load's to do, but you really can't work a whole day and every evening 7 days a week.  Have just been told by someone it's a bank holiday on Monday, that will be good as I have load's of DIY jobs to do around the house, not that I'm a fan of DIY, I'd just prefer to do something myself than pay someone to do it badly.  There are of course exception to this,  I paid to get the fence done, and I'd happily pay for plumbing, I hate messing with water, electic is easy, it works or it doesn't, with water, well get it wrong and that's the carpets and everything in the room below trashed isn't it.  I've got a few more things I want to write about today, but it's time I was getting on with somework; whatever you are doing today, hope you have a good one! :)

      Just a quick post to explain, well the lack of posts ;)  I've been really busy over the past few days developing some software, which will be been demoed to a customer tomorrow, hopefully they will like, it's quite clever, but as with all these things it doesn't matter how good it is if for some reason they don't like it.  I do like writing software; it's kind of creative, as you take a blank page and make something happen, unlike network and servers, which in effect is just like plugging things in and following instructions.   Don't get me wrong, I enjoy networking, just like the extra creativeness that programming provides.  After work today Iâm off to look at another car, so by the end of the week I should have decided on what Iâm having, I really can't wait, if you've never had a convertible you should really get one, they are, just class! :)  Iâm about half way down my to-do list, will do car insurance and order the rest of the computer bits tonight!  Right that's enough for now, since people keep checking here I figured it was only fair to posts occasionally.

      Baz Luhrmann - Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)   Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of â99 If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experienceâ¦I will dispense this advice now.  Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded. But trust me, in 20 years youâll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you canât grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really lookedâ¦.Youâre not as fat as you imagine.  Donât worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind; the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.  Do one thing everyday that scares you  Sing  Donât be reckless with other peopleâs hearts, donât put up with people who are reckless with yours.  Floss  Donât waste your time on jealousy; sometimes youâre ahead, sometimes youâre behindâ¦the race is long, and in the end, itâs only with yourself.  Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults; if you succeed in doing this, tell me how.  Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.  Stretch  Donât feel guilty if you donât know what you want to do with your lifeâ¦the most interesting people I know didnât know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still donât.  Get plenty of calcium.  Be kind to your knees, youâll miss them when theyâre gone.  Maybe youâll marry, maybe you wonât, maybe youâll have children,maybe you wonât, maybe youâll divorce at 40, maybe youâll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversaryâ¦what ever you do, donât congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either â your choices are half chance, so are everybody elseâs. Enjoy your body, use it every way you canâ¦donât be afraid of it, or what other people think of it, itâs the greatest instrument youâll ever own..  Danceâ¦even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room.  Read the directions, even if you donât follow them.  Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly.  Get to know your parents, you never know when theyâll be gone for good.  Be nice to your siblings; they are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.  Understand that friends come and go,but for the precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young.  Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard; live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.  Travel.  Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will philander, you too will get old, and when you do youâll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.  Respect your elders.  Donât expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund, maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out.  Donât mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look 85.  Be careful whose advice you buy, but, be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than itâs worth.  But trust me on the sunscreenâ¦

      Have just returned home after a slightly extended lunchtime down the pub, going to spend a bit of time surfing the net (have a few things to look at), and then will get on with the task of writing this interface, in microsoft word, I hate VBA, grrrrr :)  The sun is out, and i'm so glad my office is at the front of the house, as out the back it's so so hot, anyway i'll get on with a bit of work!

      Seriously they do, but i'm at work, currently changing some network settings on about 100 computers (it's one of the very few jobs we can't do with Logon Scripts), it's a very boring job, and something the helpdesk should really do, but it's need doing for about 3 months, so here I am, sorting it out.  :)  I've got another bit of software to write as well, something truely boring, but then arn't all data processing apps! I wish I could write games, but it's just so far beond me, i'll stick to easy things like data processing, and playing with networks.  I did try to write a game engine (purely text not graphics) about 6 months ago, but really my mind just doesn't work when it come to things like that.  I'm off down the pub at lunchtime, have something to eat (haven't had anything  yet today), then I'll probably go home and catch up on a bit of sleep.    Things to do before next weekend: -Sort out car insurance -Finish this little bit of software  -Clean Car -Buy Knife -Buy CDRW Drive and DVD-RW Drive -Fix Dad's computer -Decide on and Order new Car -Close some old bank accounts (have load's with only Â£1 in)  There we go, a to do list :)  Well i'm going to get on with a bit more work; It's nice outside you know, go out there and enjoy yourself, damm it :)

      I've decided to have a break from writing software tonight, and have started transfering over a few more websites, the latest to be moved over is  urlLink Really Cheap International Calls  which currently has a really crappy template web design (it's on my to-do list to sort it out).  I've got lot's of idea for websites, and the domains to go with them, i just lack the creative touch needed to make them look good, and the time needed to write the content for them!  I've also been playing with .htaccess, and have made parts of my website secure and think i now understand the htaccess redirect command; i'm also finally starting to get to grips with vi (it's like notepad but for unix), so all in all not a bad night :)  Actually I say i'm not writing software, but looking at the task bar on my pc I do have it open in the background, idearly i need to have it finished in the next month, so it can be beta tested then sold.  I really hope to make a bit out of it, but if not it's been fun writing it, and pocket pc programming sure is something useful to have on the cv.  Looking back over the last 10 post's I promised to introduce you all to a few more of my friends, and I haven't forgotten, i'm still just trying to get a few pic's and thing of something to write about them all; I find writing things quite hard, numbers are easy, but words, well that's a whole different ball game.  Ok, this has rambled for long enough, time I hit 'Post' and got on with something else.

      It's early, of at least it feels like it.  The past week i've been waking up just before 6am and just going back to sleep for a hour, of course today when I wanted to wake up about 6am I don't.  Will have to set my alarm and make it into work early tomorrow.  If I get time i'm going to have another look at the Peugeot 307cc later, want to make sure i'm not to tall with the roof up, and see how the gearbox works in sports :)  Need to get another car soon, still a little unsure what I really want, true i'd really like a convertable, but is it worth what it's going to cost me?  That is the question.  Still your only young once, and as I feel older than ever, I just it's now or never :) hehe  So what have I got planned for work today?  Well not much, I wasn't expecting to be here for the next couple of days, so I'll probably just get on with a bit  of tidying things up (paperwork, computer room), and make a start on the 15 new machines sat in box's that need to be on desks.  I've got lot's of more interesting projects to be doing, unfortunatly I can't do most of them during office hours.

      Haven't been back at the office long (have been out enjoying the sun :) Off to look a a 307cc later, really looking forward to having a new car, just a shame I have to wait until the middle of August.  Works going ok today, mainly as I haven't been in the office to much, not that it's bad been here, just when it's nice outside, it's good to be able to  at least see a window (I can actually see a window if i stand up, it's about 50 meters away). Still it is cool in here, that's good :)  Have just been looking through the stat's for my blog, it would appear that  urlLink Rache  has been checking where her Blog appears on the seach engines; i'm just amazed this has been indexed already!!!  Well I suppose it's back to work for a little longer, had some really strange dreams last night, i'll post more about them later :)

      Have just returned to my computer after a short break for tea.  Have been out and about a bit today, and am now truely bored of my car, it's not that it's a bad car, it's just no fun :)  But enough about the Car, (i'll get back to that later), firstly that knief I was going on about, and  urlLink here it is .  I'm going to get it and use the Â£20 gift voucher that I got from mecca games.  Back onto car's then, what I really want is a soft top, I used to have one about 5 years ago, and although it spent more time off the road than on, it was possible the greatest toy i've ever owned.  So anyway the sun is out, i want a new car :)  I have looked around and realise I can't afford a BMW 320 Convertable which is what I really want, so the choise is, either an  urlLink Vauxhall Astra ,  urlLink Peugeot 307c , or a  urlLink Renault MÃ©gane CoupÃ©-Cabriolet  .  I don't think I can afford the Astra, so that's the choice down to two.. 'umm  Well that's an epic post considering i'm also trying to write on msn :) i'll be back later, unless I find my way to a bar that is :)

      You'll probably notice I didn't make it back to my pc last night, there's a simple answer, and that of course is Beer :)  Having put together a picnic bench, I though it only fair to sit out and have a few beers!! :)  Still it's Monday morning now, and i'll have to be at work in less than an hour, quite a boring day today, with the possible exception of a trip out to a couple of offices.  Looks like a it's going to be hot again today, hopefully not to hot though.  Well that's about all for this early morning post, i'm going to drag myself off for a cold shower, and possible something to eat :)

      Seriously, let's get it cooled down a bit! :)  Been quite busy today, got up way to early and took some rubbish down the tip.  Open's at 8:30am, I wish.  At least there is less junk in the garage now, well apart from 4 fruit machines :)  Went for a drive and ended up at  urlLink Broadway , it's quite a nice Cotswold town, there's some excellent shops there (got some unwaxed lemons from a Italian style deli), and found a shop that actually know of the knife I want to buy (it's called a decorating knife, and has a kind of kinked blade on it, it's for making patterns in food, so no I'm not going on a killing spree), got back home about lunchtime.  This afternoon I'm been in DIY mode, have taken down the old tv aerial cables that were running around the house, and have put in a bit more network cable (going to put a Bluetooth access point in the front room so I can play on my Ipaq while watching tele), have also put together and painted a picnic bench that has been sat in the garage for about a year.  It's certainly to hot to be doing any of those things, but I guess since I've started I should carry on :)  What is it with flys, there are never any in the house until I make a cup of tea, then as soon as I turn my back to put away the milk a fly appears, in my tea, grrr..  it's obviously some kind of plague due to my comments about  urlLink god  yesterday :)  Well that's what I've been upto so far, I'm sure I'll be sat back here again later, just because it's sunny doesn't mean there isn't software to write :)

      Although I wanted to finish doing the intro's to my friends first, i've realised it will take me ages to get pictures and think of something to say about them, so i'll perhaps leave that for another day.  What have I been upto today?  Well not much really, of course a few hours have been spent on msn, but then thats pretty much normal.  Have been out in the garden for the past couple of hours but it's just too hot out there now (luckly my office is at the front of the house so it doesn't really get the sun at all).  I'm off out in a bit, getting a couple of things sorted on my car (G reg Merc 190e, i have a picture somewhere), then i'll probably spend the rest of the evening with a beer or two watching Eurovision.  My software is comming along well, just doing a few boring bits to it, quite a nice tidy program, and it's good to be developing something other than data conversion software, although I do have to write a XML wapper for this when it's finished.  I quite like software development, at least you are creating something, where as with networking and server support (mostly what i do during the day), your either just plugging things in or fixing them (i make that sound really simple, but even at a complex level that's essentionally all it is).  I'm slowly getting used to the new style of blogger, and having moved this onto my own web hosting i've got some extra features like the ability to upload pictues and things like that.  The template is just a default one, I will make a few changed to it, but I always have some website to be playing with.    Well on that note i'll stop typing here, and start typing somewhere else, probably my next task is to update the list of phone on  urlLink Really Cheap Unlocking  which is one of my many websites.  I say many, I only really have about 20, of those about 5 are actually active, i've been working on the web now for about 4 years, it's worrying to think that in this high tech industry so little has actually changed in this time.  See I just can't stop typing, enough is enough, I will do more work and go out :)

      Well now your introduced to me, I want to introduce you to a few of my friends.  First of all  urlLink Rachael  who i've known for about 7 months; I met her on UK Chatterbox, we talked a bit on there, and well a few phone calls, and pages of email later brings us to where we are now, really good friends :)  Also I should tell you about Claire, by contrast I've been friends with Claire for 7 years.  I met Claire as her brother was on the same course as me at college (until he left), after meeting Claire on night when we all went to the cinema we've been friends ever since.  There's a load more people to add to his, and I have some photo's to upload to :)

      Since this is my first post on here I guess i should say a bit about myself.  I'm Simon, i'm 24 (which i consider old, no really i do), I work in the IT Department for a Housing Group, and in my spare time i'll probably be at home writing software, messing about with my websites, or chatting to a few friends online.  I suppose there is a vague chance that in my spare time I might actually be messing about with one of my many hobbies (fruit machines, arcade games, hanging out with a few friends, cooking, driving about the countryside) but realisticlly it's just work work work. :)  As you read more i'm sure you will realise that I:  a) Work to much b) Have no idea what Spelling and Grammer are all about :) c) Get bored very easily (of things and people)  Well I guess that's the introduction over with, i'll post a bit more later, and after the weekend I should have my website up as well.

      Yep, you've guessed it I'm bored.  I've been working all day (some of the time at the office, most of the afternoon here), and I'm bored of looking at the computer.  The only problem is I'm in one of those moods when I think I'm just bored with everything, not really sure what I want to do, and even if I did know I could guarantee I'd be bored of it in seconds.    Ha, well back to work, at least that's the ranting over with for today :)

      It was only a week ago I said I needed 1500 more posts on here to catch up with Rache, well now she's gone and widened the gap by at least another 10 :)  My reasons for not posting much have been pretty much the same as usual, I've been working lot's and lot's over the past week, both during the day and at night!  In fact I'm sat at the office now, messing about with Samba (that's a Unix file print share thing), and Installing a new fax server.  Both enjoyable tasks for a cold and wet Saturday morning.  I feel sorry for anyone who has to be outside today!  This weekend I probably won't be up to much either, I will go and see my Nan, and perhaps go and see my parents (although they always want something so going round there is just like asking for extra work).    Well since I'm here to work I better get on with it!

      Seriously, I have all these idea for websites, things I know would work well, but putting them into practice is a totally different thing.  I'm just trying to write content for one of my sites (using my lunch hour at work), and it's just really hard to think of something to put on there that doesn't look as if it's been written by a five year old.   grrrr  Perhaps I should leave writing websites alone and just do the software, anyway I better get back to work, have to talk to lot's of boring people about network and things.

      Today has been one of those mind numbing days, i've spent the past few hours sat at work wanting to be at home so I can work on a few of my own projects, of course I get home and all I want to do is veg out in front of the tele.  (I won't of course, I have plenty of work to do, and lot's of idea for things).  I've been messing about with a few house designs; I looked a while ago at having a house built (even brought a few plan books). I know I can't afford to build a new house for a while (at least a few years), but I still keep refining my plans, adding bits and removing bits! One day it will become a reality.  Right time I was getting on with Tea, otherwise not only will I not have done any work, i'll also be hungry :)

      Only a very quick post as I've not long got up and already it's almost lunchtime.  Went to see my Nan yesterday as I'd planned and she looks so much better, spent a few hours talking to her, really good afternoon.    Because of the heavy rain I didn't make it around the wood, although did manage to take a few photos in the garden when I got home.  I need to get more practice at taking photo's of little things, this is the best I managed yesterday.  urlLink photo :)   Today I'm going to do some work, there's lot of projects I need to work on, so I'm going to pick one and spend a few hours on it! :)

      You know sometimes when you just have a lot to say, I'm in one of those moods today. I got woken up by City Link just after 7am, so have been away for ages (normally I wouldn't wake up to about now on a Saturday).  First the good news (not that there is any bad news) just this is really good.  My Nan's home again now after her recently Hip Replacement, she actually got back yesterday, it's really good that she's home, as she didn't much like the heat and inedible food at hospital.  I'm going to see her later, looking forward to that.  Blogger may not have a grammar check, but I do!  Rache has been all through my blog and corrected the spellings and grammar, I can only imagine how long that must of taken her, the first I know about it was when I got this:     I've taken the liberty of proof-reading and correcting your blog posts. Also I've added the bSTAT code to your template (invisible on the site, but it means I can check your stats). Just to let you know.   So thank you Rache! Isn't she a sweetie :)  I hope that if I ask very nicely she'll have a look over my other websites :)  I've just put my new speakers on my computer, so it's back to listerning to music when I work, the old ones really weren't to bad, only the had started to get crackly and would change volume when they felt like it :)  Now to download some good music to listern to, I'm bored with Now 57!  If the weather stays fine I'm going to take my self off for a walk around the wood later (there a really big wood that's open to the public about 3 miles walk from my nan's house) with my camera, it's been a couple of weeks since I've taken any photo's and I really want to get some of tree's :).  I'm not sure if I've ever mentioned it, but it's always been a dream of mine to have my own wood, I'm sure I'll manage it one day, I just love watching the wildlife and the peace and quiet! Yes I'm probably dreaming, but it's good to dream, I dream about lot's of things I'd like, I wonder if I'll ever actually have any of them, who knows.  I had possible the strangest dream last night, I don't really think it meant anything, it was just totally random, since you already know I'm not exactly sane there's nothing to risk by me posting it.  "It starts when I'm walking around the hospital (the one where my Nan was), when I turn a corner expecting to find a shop, I find a Church choir, all dressed in black and purple, but possible the strangest thing is that they are all Harry Potter lookalikes! I just walked on past them and headed outside, to find the that once I'd walked through the doors the building disappears and I'm left on the top of a cliff looking out to sea, I can hear voices from below, so carefully I look over the edge, below is a tribe of American Indian's hanging from the cliff with ropes collecting rocks, next thing I know I'm down there with them pulling massive bits of gold from the cliff side, again I'm not really sure what happens next, but I'm sat on the sea front talking to someone (not sure who), apart from my clothes all I have with me is a Tesco carrier bag, which at first glance appears empty, but when you open it up it's filled with food, there's everything in there (except there's no salad, yippee), and whatever you take out is instantly replaced!".    Unfortunately my dream ended there, at 7am thanks to City Link.  It was just such a vivid dream, and totally mental :)  Well I guess I'll go and spell check this, and do a bit of work; enjoy yourselves today, the weekend has landed :)

      I've just got home, which isn't bad for a Friday, and I've already been to the garage and got the car fixed (it was just something on the door that needed adjusting, don't ask me what, I haven't a clue).  I'm glad this week is over, it's been a bit to busy at work (some might say stressful, but that's just a state of mind). I might go and see my Nan in a bit, depending on when she'll be out of hospital, she might be coming home tomorrow :)  Time to find some food :)

      Let's just say eBay isn't the quickest site on the internet today :)  I thought I was about half way through putting my junk on ebay, however looking around I've found a box of stuff that didn't sell last time, it's amazing the junk that just appears, for instance I've just found a box of mobile phone manuals and a box of processor fans for 486dx cpu's!  Right off to get a drink, and maybe some food :)

      Well I managed to get the afternoon off work, so here I am, sat at the computer :)    Actually I'm sorting out my junk to go on ebay, I don't know how I end up with so much stuff, I never really remember buying any of it, so I guess it just appears; for example, today I intend to put the following on ebay: fruit machine, computer, fruit machine parts, computer parts, some dvd's (really crappy ones), and a couple of mobile phones.  I'm sure there is more stuff to go on there, but I'll do this lot first then have a hunt about the house see what else there is.  Right, back to it :)

      You know when you wake up and just want to go back to bed? I felt just like this today.  I've only just got into work, which although early is actually late for me, work will be quite boring today, just have more computers to setup and paperwork to do.  Hopefully I'll be having this afternoon off, I've got a few things to do at home (not least put some of my junk on eBay as it's free listing day today).  Well that's probably all I've got to say for now, enjoy your day :)  [ only 1500 post's needed to catch up with rache :) ]

      Have just returned from seeing my nan in hospital, I was really surprised, she looks much better than she did before her operation. We sat and talked for an hour or so, and she was telling me how she's knitted a baby coat today, and how she can't wait to get out so she can go and play bingo. Hopefully she'll be out at the weekend, but for now she's doing well where she is!   Don't really have any other plans for tonight, I've just been sat out in the garden but it's a little cold now, still way to hot in the house though.  Not really sure what to do, I was going to hang about on msn but there's a lack of people I *want* to talk to. :)  Right, that's it for looking at the screen trying to think of something interesting to write, I'll go and order a few thousand bubble gum balls :)

      I'm not sure why but I've been really sleepy all afternoon; I can't even blame it on a lunchtime trip to the pub, as today I had to take myself shopping (needed some socks), I guess it must just be the heat, or lack of fresh air in the office.  I've just logged into msn where I'll be for the next hour or so. Off to see my nan tonight, didn't go last night as she had her operation quite late in the day, looking forward to seeing her tonight :)  Well that's all I've got to say for myself really, I'll go and do some work!

Well I better be getting on with work, whatever your up to today, have fun :)

      Here is the bad news, I was just surfing the internet when it started going slow, and after about 5 minutes, just stopped (as you already know the ISP I'm using actually went bankrupt 2 months ago, and I managed to get back on using a few tricks).  Well I've just had a bit of a poke around their POP and it appears that everything is up, except the leased line (have tracert from both sides). I know that's provided by demon internet, so I just phone their business tech support, who confirmed a suspected line fault but the bad news, unless someone can give them physical access to the equipment they won't send anyone out to fix it. So there we have it, a technical fault in the one place I can't get to and no more free 2mbps internet :(  Oh well, back to dial up, only about 15 months until we had adsl here :(  (on the plus side of things, the sun is out, I'm going for a drive)

      Went out for a bit of a drive around Stratford last night, was just driving up to work (to get some stuff out my old car), when I heard someone shout "DANCEY!, you've got a new car", looked round to see Kerry trying to stand up outside a pub, stopped and chatted to her for about 10 minutes (hadn't actually seen her for about a year, so it was good to catch up).  Then I went over to Paul's, was just going to give him a lift into town to get my old car (he's fixing it for me), but ended up going for a couple of drinks (only soft drinks, don't drink at all when I'm driving). Went to the Rose & Crown, they were playing Club Anthems from about the mid 90's, stayed in there for a bit and went home about midnight.  Got up quite early on Saturday, washed the bird muck off the car (what is it with birds and a new car, how can they tell???), went over to see my nan in the afternoon.    My nan's off into hospital today for a hip replacement, so I can only hope that all goes well; I'm not quite sure what I've written about my nan before, but I'm quite close to her, when I was growing up I used to spent a lot of time with her and my grand dad as my parents both worked full time. She's just learning to use the internet, although I'm not quite sure she really understands what it's all about, it gives her something to do though, well besides knitting :)  Took nan for a drive in the car, went to see an Aunty and Uncle that I hadn't seen for atleast a year, they were quite chatty, and pretty amazed that it was my car :).  I dropped my nan off home and went over to see my parents. Took my Dad out for a drive in the car, went to his my other Nan and Grand dad (his parents), well I know it's been probably the best part of a year since I've seen them, and now I remember why, nothing but moaning, after complaining that I didn't come round very often I then had to listen to them go on for 20 mins about everything the was wrong in there life, and well the annoying thing is I didn't hear them say one thing that wasn't of there own doing, I'm not going to see them again. EVER!  Well it's about time to go to bed, have just watched the second Harry Potter movie, will go to the cinema soon and watch the new one!  Right, good night all (sorry about the ranting, only so annoyed at my nan).

      It's here, and I just can't believe it's mine! Have taken it on a bit of a drive around town (ok, about 15 miles), not sure where to go after work, probably take it into the countryside. One of the best things with a convertible is driving at night with the roof down looking at the sky!  Right well back to work, thanks for putting up with me going on about the car for the past two weeks! :)

      Except for not been able to sleep last night that is; I know it's only a new car, but I've never had a new one before, in fact I've never had one less than 10 years old before. I over slept today and just made it into work on time, which is very unusual for me, I was in 45 minutes early yesterday :)  Well I'm going to go and get on with the boring task of installing more computers.  Since my car is been delivered at lunchtime today there's no going down the pub and playing pool :( Still it is almost the weekend, and looking at weather.co.uk it's just the weekend for having the roof down :)

      Back at home now after a really boring afternoon at work, just chilling out listening to music (red hot chilli peppers) and playing pac-man :) it's just the best!  I've got to tidy out my old car tonight, ready to move my junk into the new one. I'm still supposed to be writing the software for the handheld's, but while the sun's out I'm just too relaxed to sit inside and work all night!  Today's been a strange one, have been in a quite a loud, social sort of mood; hope it lasts to the weekend, well it's only one day away. :)

      Have just returned from the pub; it's still too hot out there, it might well be cloudy but it's still too dammed hot!  I lost two out of three games of pool today, going to have an afternoon off to spend down the pub next week. Have also booked next Monday (21st) off work! Time for some time off me thinks!  Right, back to work...

      ...Till I get my car of course :) in fact by the time tomorrow I'll have my car :) YIPPEE (then I'll shut up about it I promise)  Today is just plodding along, I've got the boring job of installing some new computers and covering the help desk (since I'm the only IT person in the office today), in a way I quite like doing the easy work, but after a few days of it I get bored.  Well I don't really have anything to say so I'll get back to working on those computers, I'd much prefer to be at home today, watching my way through the stack of DVD's.  Watch Jurassic Pack 3 last night, if you haven't already seen it, don't! :)  Right I will be off, if only to the pub to play pool :)

      ...But I want to write something; it's so much easier to write here when I'm angry or annoyed at something, even if I don't post what it actually is that gives me the motivation to rant on about things.  Right now I've not really got anything to be annoyed or angry at, I'm in a really good mood, here's how today has panned out.  Got to work early and decided to sort out my inbox, 3000 messages are just to many to seach through; I got as far as late October, where I found myself reading through old emails instead of sorting them; sometimes it's good to do that, just randomly open a couple of old emails and read, of course if you pick emails like the ones I've got then it'll probably take you a few hours.  Lunchtime was spent down the pub, and I'm totally amazed to have won two out of three games of pool. I've never been very good and as many people will tell you I almost always lose, but today, I just couldn't do a bad shot. I'd hit the ball, it would go all round the table and pot something, I was amazed :)  Returned to work to find a message saying the confirmed delivery date for my car is this Friday between 9am and 12 noon. I can't wait, not so much for the car itself, but just know I've got reliable transport again. I've got plans to meet up with a few old friends over the next month or so, and I was relying on getting the car in time.  Well that's about all that happened up to now. It's so nice that it's much cooler today, the heat was starting to get to me; probably go out for a walk again tonight, see what I can find to take pictures of.    Right that's enough for now, it's time I was cooking tea :)

The good news: my car will be ready on Friday, or Saturday at the latest, I can't wait. Of course by then you just know it's going to be raining!  Well that was all I have to say for myself right now, I'm off to find something cold to drink! :)

      Have been out taking photos again this evening, I still can't really get the hang of taking them in low light, I know it's something I'm doing wrong, but I have no idea what! I'll work it out, it's a challenge I guess.  Didn't do much on the software this weekend, which is a bad thing as I'm hardly likely to stay in and want to do it once I get the car, still there's not really a rush to finish it, as long as it's done for the end of the month.    Have spent a good bit of this afternoon listerning to music, there really is some great tunes out there. Unfortunatly most of them are at least 5 years old, but still great music. I want to get my decks out and have a go at mixing (I'm not very good), but it's a bit late to be shaking the house with a bass line while trying to mix in some vocals :)   Right, will look on eBay for records I want to get, and then go to bed. Good night all :)

      Have just got back from a shopping trip, I hate shopping, getting food is bad enough, but clothes, grrrrr :) Still at least I have some summery things now, of course the task of buying things we be much easier if things were actually the size them claimed to be, but enough of that.   I'm in quite a good mood, which is pretty amazing as it's soo hot outside, if I'd got my new car I'd be on a beach somewhere (ok, more likely out of everyone's way overlooking  a beach/sea somewhere), but I'm not taking this old one a mile further than I have to, well not until it's fixed.  Went out for a drive/walk last night, and took a few photos, unfortunately it was dusk and all the photos look crappy. I'm not sure if there's something I'm supposed to do when taking photos in the evening, or if it's just something I should forget about, answers on a postcard please :)  Well I'm got lot's of shirts to iron, and a few other things to do, so I'll get on with that, and I'll be back here later!

      And it's not mine, currently I don't have a BBQ :( I'm not sure why I don't have one, as I used to have two. I guess they must have got lost or broken when we moved here, still their cheap enough, perhaps get one tomorrow :)  I've spent most of this afternoon sorting out and tidying up (despite saying I wasn't going to). My office is now a little tidier, meaning I now probably can't find anything. Why I have so much paper I don't know.  Have emailed a company about buying some vending machine, hopefully have some more ready for the summer holidays (as that's when they take the most money). I guess I'll get five of them, just have to see how the money works out.  Oh, and  urlLink another picture  took this morning, but forgot to upload. That's about all the interesting things in the garden now; still I'll go out for a walk or a drive after tea, see what else I can find :)

      Wow, that was like just too much typing, I just wanted to catch up with what's been going on, and I thought it better to post it on the right day than just have half a page here :)  I've been up since about 9am, which is quite late for me really, I still have a bit of a cold, but it's certainly going now :), My task for today, to tidy up the junk in my car, and to tidy up this office. I have a few bits of paperwork to sort out as well, but mostly it's tidying. I should really be working on that software, but I just don't feel like it today!  I've been out in the garden again taking photo's, and while I should have probably done them before the lawn was mowed (since there are bits of grass on the one picture), they don't really look to bad. I do find the view finder useless close up though, much better to use the LCD screen on the back, or it would be if using that didn't eat the batteries. Anyway, I'll stop waffling on about it and let you have a look at the pictures. A  urlLink Purple Flower , and a  urlLink Water Lily .  I've not got anything else to write yet, as the only other thing I've done today was doing my washing :( Oh well, hopefully I'll do something of interest later.

      Well the good news, according to the lease company I should have my new car next Friday, and well, with it being as hot as it is today that's not a second too soon. Really I can't wait, next Friday night might just have to be a trip to Weston Super Mud :) hehe  Have emptied the vending machine today, (it has gum, bouncing balls, and some cheap tacky toys in it), I was amazed to find that it actually had Â£81 in it, which is more than normal. I'd like to get a few more of them really. Although I'd have to call it a hobby, as although it makes money, you'd need about 100 machines to make a living of them :)  Right that's it with the back posting, think I'm all caught up with what's been going on :)

      Have ordered my car today, well have filled in all the papers to order it, and sent them to our admin manager at work, I'm going to have a new car soon YIPPEE!! :)  Other than that today has been quite uneventful.  Went out for a drink last night and drank a little to much JD and Coke, but then it's not often I go out and I'm not driving, so it doesn't hurt to have the occasional drink :)   I was going to go out for a walk tonight, and perhaps take some more photos (see I'm really getting into this), but it's raining, and as much as going out for a walk would probably do me good, going out in the rain with a cold probably wouldn't.

      And thanks to the wonders of Blogger I can :)  Serioulsy I'm not sure why there has been a lack of posts, as I've had a lot of things I want to write about, just sometimes it's taking the time to get it down on the computer :)  Have been to have a chat with the salesman at the garage, who assures me that if they get the order in the next few days I should be able to have the car before the end of the month, I'm so looking forward to getting it :)  Haven't really been doing much today, apart from work of course. I have finished off a massive load of paperwork that I've been working on for about a month, it was on it's fifth rewrite which is more than enough for anything, especially something that's only ten pages. Still it's finished now, I just hope the people reading it can understand it.  The manual for my camera makes things a whole lot easier to understand, well once Rache told me what Macro mode did anyway :) I'll have a play with that this weekend and see how I get on. I must find a better gallery script for my website, the one I've got works, but all the pictures have to be in one folder.  Right onto the next day...

      Have been back at work today, didn't really feel that well but having to much time off affects the end of year bonus; surprisingly I got quite a lot done today, but now just want to lay down on the bed and sleep :)  Have started reading the manual that came with my camera, I've found it has a macro mode for taking photos of small things, and you can turn off the digital zoom, so I'm certainly impressed with that. However it's currently raining outside so I won't be off out taking photos tonight. Probably a good thing really, I've got a few things I should really be doing.  Well that's about all that happened today, I'll probably be at the computer for a bit, hope you're all having a fun evening.

      I've been up for hours already, in fact I think I was up before 9am, which is quite shocking when i've not got to goto work!  I'm just chilling out today, i've already been down the town to get something for lunch, and done most of my washing; I have no idea what i'm going to do with the rest of the weekend, I'll probably end up playing a few computer games, might even get the playstation out and have a go with that! :)  It's way to hot to be doing anything outside, infact it's way to hot to be doing anything!! :)

      Well kind of :)  I've been running reports on Internet and Email access for work all day, of course when you get people accessing a site that the content system can't work out what it is the site has to be checked manually, hence i've had to have a look.&nbsp; Some were of course of an adult nature, hence this afternoon, i've been&nbsp;getting paid to look at porn! ha!  I'm back home now, i've decided not to work this weekend, it's to hot and town will be packed with clubbers because of Global Gathering.&nbsp; In fact I have no plans for the weekend at all, i'll probably just chill out, pehaps watch some movies, might go and see my parents (that is of course if they are back from holiday).  The weekend has landed, and it's going to be a good 'un :)

      *Waves at Rache*, who if my webstat's are correct is currently looking at my blog :)    Today's been going really well, work is kind of quiet now the helpdesk kid isn't there, hopefully he will be replaced soon with someone who can help me with my paperwork, and i'll be able to get back to doing the nice simple things like fixing the network and writing software.  Have you noticed that, it's easier to write software than it is to write a letter, hehe, perhaps i'm just strange.    Right, well I better get back to work, none of that using the internet for personal use for me :)

      After more than  6 months of working on a project at work it's just been cancelled, i'm so pissed off you can not imagine.  I wouldn't be as bad if i'd not spent quite a lot of my own time working on it (and not been paid for it).  After digging around a bit I find out they knew over a month ago they were pulling the project, so the last months work, well I might just as well not have bothered.  What a bunch of fuckers management is!!!!  /End Rant.    On a slightly better note i've just had chicken and chips for lunch.  :)

      Silly Rache, is all I can say :)&nbsp;   As it happens I had quite a good sunday, cleaned both of my car's, cooked a sunday lunch, and watched 'The Core' last night, got to bed in the early hours, so all in all not a bad Sunday.&nbsp; To be honest i'm still amazed that Rache still want's to chat to me on msn at all, it's not like i've had anything interesting to say for months, actaully other than the mad emails we sent each other when we first started talking, i've not really had anything interesting to say EVER! :)  I think the ISP i'm using is having problems, msn won't work, stat counter won't work, and lot's of the websites I visit are really slow, hopefully it'll sort itself out later, or could this be the end of my broadband connection.  Right, time to go and find something for tea.

      I'm just recovering from eating Sunday lunch, I really do tend to cook to much, still at least I won't need anything for tea tonight.   Not really been up to much today, just the usual Sunday jobs of doing the washing, tidying up the mess around the house, and soon I've got to iron my work shirts.&nbsp; See what an interesting life&nbsp;I lead :)   I'm still at a complete loss in for what name I could use for my business, I'm sure I'll think of something, currently I really do have no idea.

      That's right, i've got tomorrow off work :)  Not sure what i'm planning on doing yet, it might just be spending the day at home to catch up with housework and things, afterall I have to clean my old car before I put it on ebay.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess if the weather is nice I might go out somewhere, no idea where.  Right well since it's almost time for tea i'll just reply to a few emails, and find something to eat :)

      Yup, it's that time on a Saturday again, time to be in work, apply security patches to servers. It's a very simple and boring job, just not one that can be done in hours. Still at the end of the day it is all overtime :)     I've started work on a new blog, not so much a blog about me, just a blog half full of random rants about things, stuff I'd like to comment on here, but because quite a lot of it is things people search for on the net, I wouldn't want my actual blog with my personal thoughts on life and things getting mixed up with it!     Right, time I was working :)

      And that's if I'm best setting up my own business or not; you see on the plus side of setting up my own business mean's I can claim back a lot of things as expenses and things like that, the down side of course is the extra paperwork, tax, and business insurance.&nbsp; I'm pretty convinced now to start up my own business, I just need to think of something with a good all-round name.   You see I'd want it to be a name I could use with anything, currently I operate vending machine (you know the thing you see outside shops with kid's toys in), I fix computers, do web design, and I'm planning on setting up my own web hosting as well.&nbsp; I'm really not sure of a name... I'm guessing ????? Holdings might be good as a business name, just need to think of something to replace the ?????'s :)   Right I've sat here for to long, time to be doing something else :)

      Ok, so I'm working tomorrow, but at least I'll be in the office or my own, or at least with other people who want to work.&nbsp;   I'm glad to be home now, work has been really crappy today, well not so much work but just some dirty smelly annoying twat that sit's near to me has been annoying me more and more over the past week, I know I'm probably a bit over sensitive, as when I'm working I do like to a certain amount of quiet however I'm not sure the following is reasonable.&nbsp; He brings his dirty clothes (and bedding) into work when it smells as he doesn't want it smelling his flat out until it's washed (his mum does his washing, as even though the scummy git is 30 he still doesn't know how to use a washing machine), there is food that's over a week old on his desk, and more cups of cold coffee than most people would drink in a week; however today perhaps the most annoying thing about this complete cunt was that whenever I was trying to do some complex work, or whenever I was on the phone he'd start singing, really fucking loudly; it's really annoying when people decide that just because they don't want to work they are going to be a cunt to the people that do.&nbsp;   Mind you I'll get the fucker, but enough about that, RANT OVER :)  (until then I can take comfort in the fact at least I earn more than him)   There I'm all calm again now; right time to go and find something for tea, I'll probably be back on here again later :)

      Just a quick post since I've not written for a few days; The past week has been really tiring, work has been mad (I'll have to work again this Saturday), and I've not really spent as much time as I should have on my own projects.&nbsp; That said I'm not even going to think about them tonight, my plans are nothing more than getting a nice cool drink (cherry coke) and watching a movie.   Whatever you people are up to tonight, make sure your having fun doing it :)&nbsp; Good night!

      The software that is, i've just written a information screen so when peeps are looking at the jobs they can get a full 'customer' address, contact, and a link to a&nbsp; mapping service or gps so they can see exactly where to go.&nbsp; I'm looking at some more handheld computers next week, this time with a camera attached and a smartphone to see if I can get my application running on those. &nbsp; Aside from working today, i've also signed up for a free months trial of blockbuster's online dvd rental.&nbsp; I think I should spend at least a couple of the days of my holiday watching movies! :) &nbsp; I'm going to do a bit more work and then probably fall asleep watching tv, have&nbsp;nice night out there in Internet Land :)

      Ok, before you laugh at me, it's a good game! :) &nbsp; A while ago (say about 5 years) I got a demo disk for a game called Castles II, i played this for ages, but of course been a demo you could never win (games would only last 20mins then it would force you to exit).&nbsp; I finally tracked down the full version on ebay.com, paid a bit for it, and had to pay customs charges to get it into the uk.&nbsp; Once I got it I found it wouldn't run on any computer made since about 1996, i tried all sorts of emulators and things to get it work; today I gave up and actually put togehter an old computer, installed the game, and have just spent 4 hours playing it from Start to finish! I'm so pleased I finally managed to complete it :) &nbsp; I suppose I better get back to doing something useful now! &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Yes, it's totally to early to be working, still most of the server side of the upgrade is complete; I've been surfing the web while I've been working, it's amazing the number of sites there are out there on everything you can think of, spooky really.&nbsp; I guess until you type something obscure into a search engine you really don't know appreciate the size and diversity of the internet.  &nbsp;  Right back to work :)

      Yes, I did something wrong, I hate making mistakes, even though really it wasn't all my fault, in fact 3 people did something wrong, and in trying to correct it I forgot to check something, still annoying though.  &nbsp;  Well it's the weekend and once again I'm working, I've got a database to upgrade tomorrow, so it will probably be a 4am start, I know that sounds early, but I've got to upgrade the server (which can take hours), then about 200 PC's, in two different offices.&nbsp; So plenty of work for me!&nbsp; Still as always it pays the bills, and with the extra this car is costing me, I'm up for all the overtime I can get.  &nbsp;  And I see blogger has changed it's interface again, I guess we should prepare ourselves for a onslaught of new bugs!&nbsp; hehe, Seriously Google, keep up the good work!  &nbsp;  Right, I'm off to play with me website, see if I can get a few photo's uploaded!

      I've been sat here for about the past half hour working on this handheld software, for reasons unknown I've not done much over the past month, so it's back to the rush of trying to get it finished, so it can be tested.  I might not do to much more tonight, I've done quite a bit already and I'm feeling quite sleepy, perhaps I'll go and watch some TV and come back to it in a bit :)  Had a email today from one of my college friends I'd not heard for  almost a year, its good when old friends get in contact!

      I've just got back from work, and feel just about ready to go to bed!  I fell asleep last night watching tele, so didn't make it back to the computer till almost midnight.  I'm sure there must be a reason for been so sleepy; a reason other than work I mean!  The car has been back to the garage today, I guess they are not that bad, afterall they have managed to fix almost half the problems on my MONTH OLD CAR!!! It's got to have a new door, and a new cd player, to go with the new heater they fitted today.  The worst thing is the brought the car back dirty and with just enough petrol in it for my to drive it to the garage, despite there been a 1/4 of a tank in it when they collected it.  GRRRRR!!  /Rant Over  Right, time to find something for tea.

Other than work things have been going quite well today, I've got a gallery script working on my website, so now all I need to do is resize a few of the images and put a bit of text with them :)  It's messy in here again today, I'm not really sure why, but junk just sort of appears around me, guess I'll tidy a bit of it up at the weekend.  I keep meaning to write a bit on here about my holiday, perhaps I'll do that later, the short version 'I had a great time, and wish I was still there'.  Have fun people, whatever you might be up to!

      ...on a summer holiday!   No more msn for a week :(  However I am equipped with both a bluetooth mobile phone, Compaq Ipaq, and another mobile phone with a xhttp web browser built into it :)  I could have msn if I wanted it, but at 30p per minute it's a little pricey.  I'll looking forward to some time away from here, (the reason I'm not taking a laptop is I don't want to be tempted by work).  I am going to take my camera and expect to come back with the memory card pack full of pic's (and it holds just over 300!).  Hope you all have an excellent week, and let's hope I don't get rained on to much!

      Would you believe that the only 10 mins that's it's been raining today happened to be just as I was walking back from town.  It's like the middle of summer again out there now!!  grr! :)  I've been to the bank and payed in my winnings Â£11.40 from the latest CyberSlotz Promo, and the Â£100 out of the vending machine, posted more of my ebay junk and had a bit of a look around a few other shops.  Town is really quiet today, I guess the impending rain was keeping the old people away!  Well I better get on with my work, I have so many things I want to try and do today!

Right, time to go and do some washing and cleaning up, back in a bit

      I know it's been a little while since I last posted, I'm not really sure why I haven't posted for a while, probably just because I haven't really had that much to say for myself.  I've also been quite busy this week, fixing computers for people, and dealing with everything I've sold on eBay; most of my eBay stuff has been paid for and posted or collected, so once again there is a bit more room around here! :)  I've got today and tomorrow off work, and then next week I'm off on Holiday; hopefully today and tomorrow I'll get a bit more work done on my little projects I've got going on, there's a couple of websites, and some software to finish off!! I will probably get board of that pretty soon, and end up watching some tv!  Right will I'm going to go and get on with it, was really nice having a layin this morning!

      Only a quick post as I must start work soon.  Firstly an apology to Rache, sorry I wasn't back on msn last night, despite the heat I managed to fall asleep watching a movie. Hopefully I'll be about later, of course depending on what time I finish work!  I actaully really don't feel like going to work today, but there really is so so much that needs doing, and it's next to impossible to do anything even remotly comlpex when your been interupted every few seconds to sort out a helpdesk problem.  Much better to do it out of hours.  Right, off to work I go :)

      Yep, I really do feel like that, got home about 2am this morning, feeling a little drunk thanks to a few JD and Coke's :)  The plan was just to go out for a drink with Paul, however ended up meeting up with John, and a few of his friends (which I must say were VERY strange people, but more on that later), ended up in Ripple, which doesn't kick out to about 1:30am.  Note to self: Midweek drinking is BAD!!!  I'm pretty much on my own in the IT deptartment today, not that I really mind,  I just know it's going to be on of those busy days!  Right I better get going, i'll post a bit more when I get home!

      I can only appologise for my lack of post's on here over the past few days; truth be told i'm simply so busy at work typing things on the computer when I get home really isn't the first thing on my mind.  Work is really busy now, so busy I've cancelled my week off next week (well moved it to october, although we'll probably be just as busy then).  I'm also working this weekend, and probably late some nights as well.  The reason for this busyness, the lad who used to run the Helpdesk has been sacked (I think they call it dismissed now), so not only do I have my own normal work, and the big networking project, I also have the helpdesk to cover as well (and fix the utter mess he'd made of somethings over the past few months).  So there we have it, a very busy Simon, for the next few months at least! :)

I've just opened a bank account at Smile (there an internet bank), because they give you 6 free bottles of wine, hehe, anything for a freebie :)   Right i'll get back to my websites!

      Yep, today is Sunday, i've been up for a couple of hours but still not managed to do anything useful, apart from winning 20pence on gala games. I'll probably end up doing a bit of work this afternoon, of course 'work' could just mean messing about with my websites.  I'm looking forward to work tomorrow, it's certainly going to be an interesting day :)
