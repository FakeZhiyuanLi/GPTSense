      The other day, I was thinking about my friend who had a problem with their friends.  This story is almost true but I just added it some of them that arent true but you will get the whole picture... Let me make up the names for this friends... Jason, Mike, and Matt. Jason is the young guy and Matt is pretty much older than Jason.  Mike is about between Jason's and Matt's ages.    Jason and Matt met each other last year and became roommate but they did have a fling for each other for short time.  About few months later, Jason met Mike and Jason really like Mike very much.  They were getting know each other more and of course, they ended up have a "fling" together.  Later on, Mike grew out of it with Jason and he just want to become a good friend with Jason.  Of course, Jason didnt like it very much but he had to accept it.  Mike already met Matt because they met each other through Jason.  One night, they (Jason, Mike, and Matt) went out to nightclub with other friends. Of course, NIGHTCLUB!? DRINK DRINK DRINK!!! Mike and Matt ended up dancing all night and hitted off very well... Jason noticed that Mike and Matt started to hung out more than before. Jason felt left out by them and he found this is very annoying.  Jason noticed that Mike shared with his experience with Matt than Jason and he felt that he's unimportant but Matt and Mike really like each other a lot and they really want more further but they cant because of Jason.  Jason really like Mike a lot and Matt felt in the middle because he also like Mike...  Somehow, Matt and Mike felt that they are prevented to go out because of Jason.     So, my question to you, If you're Jason...  Will you let them go even though if you really like Mike very much?     Let me share with my opinion, If I am Jason, Of course, I will be jealous about that because I happened to like Mike and my roommate ended up with Mike but it will take a while for me to let it go even its hard to hide my feeling not to show them how I felt about them. But think about it, what if Mike and Matt are suitable to each other like "soulmate".  One question that I want to ask you all, pretend this, if you really like this person and you both ended up had a good time and all that "fling" together then later on, this person dont want go more further with you and decided to be your friend but you really like him a lot and thought he's the "ONE". But you have to let it go and move on but this person ended up with your friend and they are pretty much along very well... But you dont like it very much and try to find a way to keep them apart... Will you do that? hmmm? Will you fight to get this person? so I'll leave it up to you all...

      I just noticed that lately people dont really forgive to each other so easily and I was like? what the fuck? GROW UP!  So, I just want to express my feeling how I see people really forgive...  So I just looked up the dictionary.com and I pasted it:  for·give    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (fr-gv, fôr-) v. for·gave, (-gv) for·giv·en, (-gvn) for·giv·ing, for·gives  v. tr. To excuse for a fault or an offense; pardon.  To renounce anger or resentment against.  To absolve from payment of (a debt, for example).   What is forgive means to you? I often forgive people a lot because if I dont forgive people, I often felt so tense and I really hate this feeling so why not just let it go and move on...  Of course, you can just forgive them but you might will not forget what they did to you... that is all, is that so simple? Maybe I'm wrong or they must have some reason why they refuse to forgive other people but I think you should forgive immendently...  Have you ever watch Queer as Folk last two sundays ago or something like that?  Deb (Michael's mom, the PFLAG mom), she said really harash to her brother, VIC, who has HIV poz.  She refused to apologize about what she said really harash on him.  Few days later, Vic died due to heart attack and Deb found out about that and she refused to forgive herself because she havent forgive him or apologize him so, its take a while for her to forgive herself.  My question to you? Can you tolerate that feeling if something happen to your friends or family members? SO, people, THINK! Also, why waste it? if my best friend and I been through a lot of shit happens, so we ended up not friends and refuse to forgive.  Why all the waste of years that we have been through? Can you just precious the friendship what you guys have been through? Hmmm?   I have several people who refused to forgive me what I've done to them but I was willing to talk with them out and clear it up but they refused to do that so I had to let it go because they hold the grudge or they have to much pride? I honestly cant see what's people's mind...  Yet, I forgive them and move on.    What's the wonderful feeling if you forgive these people fast, its really peace of mind and you dont have to think about how we do have to deal with.  Just forgive them immendently unless if you want to have a time then communicate this person that you want to have a time and will deal with them later when you feel ready...  Its soo easy to do that, really... AGREE???  I like this quote and I'm strongly support this, "Communicate is a key to succeed"   My question to you, people, CAN YOU REALLY FORGIVE PEOPLE EASILY IF THESE PEOPLE REALLY HURT YOU?  PEOPLE, PLEASE THINK CAREFULLY...

      Well well, HAWAI'I is soo awesome!   FABULIOUS!!!   Bradley Brown, David Fontes, and I flew to Hawai'i to see Bradley Dale aka Bray for our vacation but not for David cuz he will have a LONG vacation in Hawai'i! WHY? He's moving there to live with Bray as roommate (I miss David dearly and he's my best friend).  Well, Hawai'i, How can I really explain about Hawai'i...  hmmm, undescribable!! (if you really want to know about Hawai'i? then you need to join with us for New Year Eve.  We are working on going to hawai'i for nye)  When we landed on Oahu, HI and I told Bradley and David that not to expect to see luau girls to give us lei.  They were kinda disappointed about that and I told them,"GAWD! I guess you watch t.v. too much!" so we laughed about it.  So finally, we met Ollie Luer, Bray's roommate (former boyfriend) and guess what? He gave us the leis! heh...     First, I don't want to confuse y'all.  If I said BRAY means Bradley Dale and Brad mean Bradley Brown.     Ollie took us to Bray's work at community college in hawai'i... He's teaching ASL there and I finally saw him since two years ago and was very exciting to see him again. David and Bray never met each other so they've been talking each other for like two years and FINALLY, they met!  (CHEER) We all went out to eat for dinner at cheesecake factory.  Brad, David and I were very TIRED! Hawai'i's time is like 9pm and DC time is like 3am! So, Brad, David and I looked like a SHIT!    During that week, We went out to the beach, looking around the island and all that... It was beautiful there!  Especially BEACH! There's a gay beach in waikiki, its called "QUEEN'S SURF" LOL! I KNOW! I KNOW! its soo gay! lol...    There's one thing I wanna tell you and I think this is cute one.  When we arrived and finally saw Bray.  Brad and I were puzzled to see him because his appearance and his clothing is not what we expected.  Remember this, Brad, Bray and I are ARIES!  Brad's birthday is on March 26th and Bray and I have same birthday, March 25th.  During that week, Brad let Bray borrowed his clothes and I had to fix his hair.  One night, I told Bray that he need to do something about his hair because its too PLAIN! Well, I have to admit that ARIES like to be FLAMY and we DONT like tooo plainly!  So Bray and I went to wal-mart and to get highlight kits and all that... Bray never had a highlight before so I have the cap on him so that way i can pull out to highlight on it...  He was kinda grumpy because its hurts!  Brad told Bray to SHUT UP AND ACCEPT! Bray was like, FUCK! and he has been patience for that!  I think its funny and then I added black tip on his hair so he has brown hair, blonde and little black on it...  HE LOOKED GREAT!  So the end of week, Brad and I looked at Bray and he looked GREAT!!!!  Brad and I looked each other and we said,"WE DID GOOD JOB!"     Few days before I went back to mainland.  Bray and I went to big island for one night as SISTER NIGHT.  Bray and I felt that we are soo SISTER (I know it's SO GAY! but SHUT UP!) We went into the plane decided to order wine and we were buzzed and we made a fun of some people (OOPS)...  When we landed Big Island from Oahu.  We rented convertible car and we felt so COOL at that moment...  We went to hotel and drop thing off and went out to eat resturant called,"Bumma Gump". Forrest Gump resturant! heh...  After that, we went to gay bar and that's only gay bar in Big Island... Not a lot of people there so we just went ahead and ordered drinks... WE DRANK A LOT and we had a blast time...  Next day, we are supposed to go to see volocanoes but somehow we have a $$$ plm due to miscommunicate! it was really HELL!!! we were so grumpy and it was so hot outside and all that so I had to have David sent us some money through western union and waited for like five hours!!!  PAIN IN ASS! We couldnt go to see volocanoes so we decided to eat Hard Rock Cafe and check the beaches out and it was very interesting!  Then went back to Oahu.  BUT THOUGH, we had a good time!   There's one beach that I love to go... Its a local beach called waimea bay beach...  They have a cliff that we can jump into the ocean and I believe its like about up to 25 to 30 feet to jump from the cliff...  We checked a lot of CUTE guys there!  When I swam far from the land and I could see the below the ocean and its soo CLEAR!  So finally we took a rest and we all fell asleep for like 45 to one hour.  I woke up and its a perfect timing, we were watching sunset! it was soo beautiful!     Well, I have a lot of thing to tell you but this is one is good enuff for me to finish it but one more thing, when the day I have to go back to mainland, Bray and I were sad because we already miss each other and also I miss David too... I might wont see him until NYE.  It was very emotionally for me to leave like that but I wish David and Bray a best of luck in Hawai'i.     Well, that's all, FOLKS!  ALOHA!

      BOY! Last night, my friends wanted me to go to green lantern/tool shed for a happy hour but I couldnt go out because I was too tired.  I decided to take a nap then go APEX instead of going to GL/TS.  SO I went there and had a good time!  I caught up the news with my friends because I was so busy all week from work.  Of course, I was really buzzed from 151 proof bacardi rum with pineapple juice.  so that's all about it last night, I dont really need to tell all the details about apex last night.

      Sorry guys! its been a while ago!  I'm gonna tell you what did i do on lee's mini surprise birthday party and Jesse and Lee surprise birthday party...  On june 18th, Friday, Lee's 30th birthday...  The day before Lee's birthday party, I asked Scott and Emerson if we could throw a party for Lee and we agreed to do on celebrate his birthday...  So I emailed everyone to see if they could come over for his birthday. Some of them can make it to his birthday...  Next day, (on Lee's birthday) I left from work early and picked Emerson from work.  Chuck lived near Emerson's work so we picked him up and went home.  Chuck, Scott, Emerson and I are very HUNGRY...  we want to get something to eat for dinner so we decided to eat at wendy's...  Lee paged me and asked me if he could join with us because he was on his way to home to see us.  So, lee showed up and I could see him DRUNK! He was HUNGRY so I treated him for dinner...  I asked him where did he went and he said that he went out with jessy, jonelle and buck to swimming pool and had some drinks!  Lee told me that he only had three drinks and he's pretty much BUZZED! lol...  After that, Chuck joined with Lee to my place while Scott, Emerson and I went to Giant to get cake and beer...  I got people who paged me that they will come over.  Lee told me that he would go out tonight and I ordered him not to go out and he gave me his look that "DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO ON MY BIRTHDAY". LOL! I covered up fast and I asked him what's in his mind for going out tonite and he has no clue about that...  So we went home and Cliff stopped by! YAY! Second guest came over!  We drank our beer in lee's bedroom and chat chat...  Of course there is something else we did but I'm not very comofortable to say in this blog!  Then the more people come by that surprised Lee very well... He didnt expected to see these people...  Scott listed this people on his blog so if you want to see who are those people went to his birthday party...  We stayed up until like 3am or something like that but it was BLAST!  So I asked Lee if he had a good time and he has this wide SMILE and his eyes were widen OPEN and he said YES!! HAD A BLAST TIME!  *25* (touch heart) Glad that he has a good time on his 30th birthday.... Chuck and I were discussing about having another party for lee because some people couldnt make it to his birthday party so would like to make up on his birthday...  I told Chuck that I would like to have a pool party and I asked chuck if he could find one for me and he gave me some optional!  Thanks CHUCK!!!!  He's very helpful!  Somehow, Lee told me that Todd (Jesse Conrad's partner) and Lee had been discussed about having a surprise birthday party for Jesse...   So, Chuck had to talk with Todd and share our plans...  Todd like the idea of the party so Todd, Chuck and I've been working on that for a week and made some plans for everyone...  Chuck found this public swimming pool in Laurel which is very nice!  They have four swimming pools, One is for toddlers' pool, the other one is 3 to 4 feet tall pool (the largest pools of all), Two of them is deepest one, one is like 6 feet tall and other one is 12 feet tall for diving board and slide...  We only need to pay like 5.25 dollars from 1pm to 8pm, not bad!?!? On July 2nd, Gabe and Allan were on their road to baltimore from Philly...  They met me at my work to check out my office but unfortunetly, my office will be move soon! Ill explain the next blog!  FOCUS FOCUS ON PARTIES! (*GIGGLE*) After that, Allan decided to joined with me to pick Emerson up while Gabe followed me...  After I picked Emerson up, we went home and kicked back at my place... Of course, we did a bit party in our place in the afternoon...  I ended up really tired and went to bed early like 10pm while some of them want to go out SECRET...  AJ came over too...  CHADIVA moved to d.c. from louisana due his personal problem but welcome back!  (Chadiva is very happy to be here in d.c. check his blog..)   On July 3rd, We woke up like 11ish in the morning and we have to get ready to go swimming pool but I had to go to store and buy the cake...  AJ went to store with me because I dont want Lee to come with me but ended up Lee asked me if he could join with us and I was like SHIT!  But didnt want him to suspect anything so i had to let him to join with me...  Went to Giant to buy bigger CAKE!  Todd asked me if we could add spongebob on it so we did.  Lee suggested that we should add "HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESSE" and AJ and I looked each other and we smiled but I told him that I just want to be SIMPLE "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" so Lee was puzzled about it but he just not really noticed something fishy but he went along with us!  So, I asked people to meet me at my place at noonish...  I'm gonna list who are those people went with us to the swimming pool. Lee Masa (ME!) Emerson Scott Jesse Todd Chuck Jeff AJ Allan Gabe Imran Chadiva Troy Jessy Jonelle Sara Victor Rene Renato Some of them will meet us at the pool...  After that, I had to meet Chuck since I dont know where is it so Lee and I had to meet Chuck then Chuck led us there to pool...  So, when we arrived, Jesse forgot to bring his swimming short but he did brought it but left in the car.  He joined with Lee to the swimming pool, he forgot to took it with him! LOL! Jesse begged Todd if he could give him a ride to store to buy new short! POOR JESSE! FINALLY, everyone showed up and I had to get everyone's attention. I said that we have some announcement..  I thanked for everyone to showed up and all that and the reason why we were here for two persons is LEE AND JESSE!  They both were surprised about it!  So after that, we swam and play around..  OF COURSE!  We are too expose to everyone at the public pool but it was a lot of FUN!  After that, we decided to go to TGIF and we ordered our dinner and something to drink! OH BOY! we were BUZZED! After the dinner, there is more people show up at my place, Cliff showed up and so do Derrick.  There is more people showed up but I couldnt remember who.  We had to get ready for Velvet Nation.  Before we went to VN, we served the cake and Lee and Jesse were surprised about it but Jesse were puzzled about spongebob thing on the cake and I told Jesse that Todd requested me to add spongebob on it because Todd mentioned me that Jesse didnt really like spongebob! lol...  No one wanted to eat cake because all they want to DRINK AND GET FUCK UP! So we all went to velvet nation, of course, you guys all know what Velvet Nation is all ABOUT!  We went there to FUCKED OURSELVES UP!  We bumped into Buck and his friend, Victor...  Billy showed up later, Terese showed up with her friend, Ruben...  We had a blast time together and after that, we decided to go home and kick back because we were still ALIVE.  Some people wanna join with us to kick back so they came over and we chat chat chat chat! Lee didnt show up until 830am.  Some people left and some of us were staying... We ended up play the playing cards called "PHASE TEN"... Its a lot of FUN!  but we stayed up until like 10 to 11am and I was SOO FUCKING TIRED!  so went to bed while emerson woke up! lol...  I slept until like 4pm. So that day is on july 4th, we went to CMRA cookout on 4th of july!  CMRA were surprised that I rvsp'ed 20 people for 4th of july cookout...  So its a lot of fun!  We just relaxed and watching the fireworks after that went back home and we were lazy! lol! it was a good time!  I asked Jesse and Lee if they had a blast time and they said YES!!!  Had a wonderful time!  So that's what we did!  heh...
