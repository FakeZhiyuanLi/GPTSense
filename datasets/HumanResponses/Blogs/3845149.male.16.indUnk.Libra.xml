      Yesterday's episode of The O.C. was probably the best one yet, cuz Hailey was introduced. Damn, the show just keeps getting better and better. Marrisa's damn hot, Anna's damn fricking hot, and Hailey's fricking-flames-of-hell hot. Now, if only I could remember her real name...don't ask me why, but I think Marissa's mother is kinda hot too. Speaking of hot, Maria from year 2 of MCM is pretty darn hot as well. Nice tattoo you got there, heh heh. Now, what the hell is the purpose of this post? I really have no idea. I really should be doing the damn Graph comm thing due today. But man, Hailey's so damn hot...

       Today Slut did something which shocked the hell outta me: It tried to catch a lizard. The lizard was on the ceiling,&nbsp;I was&nbsp;feeding Slut, when suddenly the damned cat did a Jackie Chan and ran up my neighbor's door, jumped off it and went after the lizard. Luckily for the reptile, Slut missed. A little surprising how such a cute and affectionate animal can be such a cool and calculating hunter. A good example of how you can never judge a book by it's cover, eh. So those of you who have cats, remember; there's a little tiger in every one of them.

        Women I like always seem to walk out of my life. This girl I like when I was in Sec 2 graduated. My favorite teacher suddenly quit and went back to journalism. The very first woman I think I loved left and went back to her home country. Coincidence? Tough luck? Screw relationships. Why do some people continuously seek to be in relationships? For companionship? For popularity? For sex? For the sake of getting into one?     When we like someone, how many times out of ten does it start with physical attraction? I'd say about 9. Which is why you should never trust yourself. You think you like the person, but it's just your primal instincts telling you to get into their pants and procreate to keep the human race from going extinct. The next time you think you like someone, stay back and observe. You'd be surprised how many times you feel disgusted by that person's actions. A good example of looking before you leap. You'd be hurt a lot less, you'd waste a lot less time, you'd save a lotta effort trying to attract the person's attention. And you wouldn't make yourself look like a fool.     So the next time you find yourself looking at a guy/gal and you think, "Man, s/he's hot!", you'd know it's the primape in you talking.

      Open Up Your Mind is a half jap/english song by Mirai. It's a damn nice song...even a metal lover like me likes it, so it'll probably appeal to a lotta others as well. It relates to me and my situation some time back so much, it was a bit freaky. Ah well, for those of you who know what I'm talking about, good for you. Those who don't, well, I'll say when I feel like it.   In this world when life can be so tough You must be strong Just believe in yourself and don't you fear So open up your mind And close your eyes Take another look From the other side  Just remember you are not alone So don't you fear  Even though you're miles away I'm by your side So open up your mind And close your eyes I'll be there for you No matter where you are   For the full lyrics, go to http://www.animelyrics.com/anime/gsaiyuki/openupyourmind.htm.

      I have no idea how some people can tell a blatant lie through their teeth just to make themselves look good. It's so pathetic. If you're gay, admit it. If you smoke, admit it. If you like to engage in certain activities with different species of rodents, admit it. No need to deny just so it will make you look cooler or better. It's becoming pretty clear to me what certain people are like. Well, if my observations are correct, time wil show everyone the truth, about what kinda persons people are. No need for me to mention names, like I always say...time will show. Oh, and just a thought, don't accept and believe things as they come. Always question and doubt. You'd be surprised how much more you'll find out if you do.

      Just some stuff about what I've observed throughout the years, and what I'm still observing.  Some girls act cute around guys they like(which is disgusting and degrading in my opinion), while they can be total bitches around others. Some guys try to act cool by going out of their way to to things out of the norm, saying things which no one needs to know about, and frankly, no one wants to hear about, while at the same time, the very same guy can be a real asshole, disrespectful his parents, having ulterior motives for trying to get close a girl, etc.   To the women reading this, don't go acting cute/slutty/innocent around guys. We WILL know when you're not acting normal around us, and I think any decent guy will find it highly insulting that you think you can attract us using such degrading methods. If you do manage to get a guy this way, you'll know that his brain is in his dick.   For the guys, don't try to get a girl by trying to impress her. Don't reveal things that only you should know about just so that it'll make you look good compared to the rest. Doing so will make you look desperate, insecure and pathetic. If any girl falls for you because of what I've mentioned above, then she's probably shallow and just as desperate as you are.  Just my 2 cents' worth.

      It's boring to be home alone. There's nothing much to do, nothing nice on TV(unless you consider old folks singing nice), not a lot of people online to chat with. With nothing better to do, I set Sophia's mud caked shoes(which she requested I took home, since she was going out after class) out on my window ledge for some much needed airing. They look like they've been dug out of some closet of shoes that she's probably never worn for a hell of a long time. Anyway, having nothing better to do after that, I thought I'd get Slut to scare the caterer by enticing her with some food, but she just couldn't give a damn...stupid cat. After feeding you for 2 months and letting you sleep in the basket of my bicycle, this is the thanks I get? For those of you wondering, Slut's the name of the stray cat that always comes to my house for food and to sleep. My father gave her the name, because he said that she allowed anyone to touch her(as in, patting and stroking, you sickos). She's a nice cat though. She'd follow me into the lift when I take it, she's there at my door when I come home(to demand that I feed her). Took a lot of photos of the cat in my phone(some of you have probably seen it), so if you wanna see, tell me.

      Just came outta S&W class, now in canteen 2 with Sophia, Neng Hao and his friend Khien eating in front of me, while I'm sitting here drinking my Green Tea(no oolong tea here). Fitness and Conditioning was pretty much hell(for me, anyway). Six months of slacking off and too much gaming has taken its toll. Time to get in shape...come to think of it, I was never in shape anyway. Guess now's a good time, eh. High time to shut the hell up and get on with it.

      Life it seems will fade away Drifting further everyday Getting lost within myself Nothing matters no one else  I have lost the will to live Simply nothing more to give There is nothing more for me Need the end to set me free  If this song were to be given a lotta publicity(sorta like how linkin park does it), I think a hell lot of teens will relate to it. It's just sad that all the music people listen to these days are the over publicised types that have no substance. Music will then be made to cater the people's likes/dislikes, and longer be made to express the artiste's thoughts and ideas(esp true for the rock/metal genre). A good example is Linkin Park. Yes, I think they suck. Their music is boring, and tunes are all the same. They have become no different from 5566 or Fag 4.

      I have the most screwed up timetable in my class. No doubt about that. I'm the only one with a 2 hour break on Monday, a 5 hour break on Wednesday and a 3 hour break on Friday. Oh ya, the goddamn speech thing on Thursday...maybe I'll talk about the benefits of drinking. I don't actually drink, but I look like I drink, so perhaps Cordelia will be convinced. We'll see. Well, she already thinks I smoke anyway. Told ya my face gives people the impression of all that is bad.

      I know I look like I want to beat someone up. I know I look pissed. I know I look like I drink, smoke, gamble and fight a lot. And yes, I know I look like I'm in my 20s. So anyone reading this, there's no need for you to tell me...I know. So to whomever it may concern, I do not do any of the above. I know it's hard to believe, but it's the truth. Oh yeah, I AM 17. Anyway, a brief intro: If my blog add didn't tell you already, I hate posers. Posers=people who try to act like someone/something they're not, people who try to show off too much are all goddamn posers. Do not try to be a poser, for everyone's sake. You'll make people dislike you. For the MCM class T103, I think there are a few posers around, tho I'm not going to mention names here, cuz I'm not a gossiping bitch.

      I have no idea why people would want to post on a site like this and write a so called "diary". I know this post itself is a contradiction, but maybe I'll see what's so fun about this.

      I've seen a certain primary school classmate of mine a few times on the bus on the way home. I used to like her way back when I was still a stupid fat kid in primary school, till early sec 2.  She seems to get prettier every time I see her. Man, I really had foresight. She reminds me of Jacelyn Tay(whom I think is really pretty). They have that same air of classiness(is that a word?). Wanted to ask her out once, but finally decided against it due to certain unresolved issues with myself. Anyway, next time, don't question my tastes in women, because I know I have good tastes. Speaking of women, the OC is coming up later. Can't wait to see Hailey again. Man, she's hot.

      Just got my hair cut today. I know people think my hair's already pretty short, but I just got sick of it. Then again, maybe I've told the guy to cut it too short...I can visualise people asking me all kinda questions about it tomorrow. "You cut your hair?" being the most stupid one. I have no idea why people would ask such an obvious question. No, I'm actually wearing a wig, I didn't cut my hair at all. Talk about a bad hair day. Wait a minute...there's not enough hair to have a bad hair day. Ah shit...
