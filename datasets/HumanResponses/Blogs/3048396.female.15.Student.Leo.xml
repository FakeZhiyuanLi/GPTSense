      So yeah. It'd be me again. I thought I'd write since I have nothing better to do. So anyways...this week has kinda been poopy. I dunno. Somethings up. I haven't figured it out yet. I feel all weird inside. I feel like something bad is gonna happen. Ya know its just one of those feelings. I've been kinda down lately...and I don't have any idea why. I mean everythings great. My life is fine. Im getting good grades...summer is coming...and only 43 more days of school. I should feel fine. But...I don't. Theres something bugging me, and I don't know what. It just might be nerves...for this weekend. The small group contest on Saturday might be one. I have to play with 6 other people infront of a judge. Thats really not that bad. And then Sunday at 1:30 is my piano recital. That could be whats gettin to me...but who knows. I just feel like something bad is gonna happen soon. But hey. Im just weird....and everyone knows that already. Moving on...  Monday was an alright day. Nothing bad really happened...nothing good. Just an ordinary day. I really can't remember it...so yeah.  Yesterday was alright...except I felt like shit. But otherwise it was alright...Piano lessons went good for once. Julie said Im ready for this weekend...Im just not ready...on the inside. Nerves...*sigh* my hands have already been sweating...Eh Im such a worry wort. I wish I could just let some things go...but no I have to be dumb...and worry about every little thing posible. Oh well. I guess that makes me, me.  Today went pretty good. In Science the principal got on the intercom and said we were under a tornado warning...and I believed him at first...boy did my heart jump. But then he said it was only a drill but still. Eh if theres one thing that freaks me out...its tornados. Its always been a fear of mine. I remember when I was little n stuff and I'd wake up to my dad carring me down the basement steps and I'd freak out. I dunno...they just always freak me out. Yeah Im weird. I know. LoL. Band and Choir was pretty good today. Choir I got almost all my homework done so that made me happy and in band we hung out in the hall. It was amuzing. Greg is just so funny...and stupid! lol He told us that he tried all of the scented markers once and that the brown one actually tasted liked cinnimon. lol. He cracks me up. Then he told us that he did that just last year. Fun guy tho. LoL...but weird...so yeah. I went to the church and practiced the organ for about 40 mins tonight...and I'm doing pretty good on it...I just hope it goes good Sunday. So yeah I guess thats all thats been going on lately. I just wish I knew whats buggin me. I hope its nothing bad. I don't want anything bad to happen...anytime soon. Cuz of right now...my life is just great.  -Tara

      Well, I guess this is the first -real- entry. So yeah...bear with me...  So yeah. Today was alright. It was about 70 degrees which made me quite happy. I love warm weather. It makes me feel better about life n such. Anyways its great. It means summer is coming. And I can't wait. This summer should be pretty good since I'll be pretty laid back. I can't take drivers ed till next year because Im to young. Its gay. And Im to lazy to get a job. So yeah. I'll probably attempt to live in Humboldt as much as I can. Anyways...as I was saying...  Spanish today was alright. Barely did anything so I did some homework and yeah it was just peachy. In Science we went outside. It was a tad chilly and my shoes got all muddy. I was mad. But all the mud came off in the school. lol. Poor janitors. lol Yeah that was alright. In homeroom dumb DeGroot made us all fold programs for the play which is tomorrow night. Eh. It was dumb. And I can't fold worth a toot. lol So yeah. Algebra was poopy like normal. Band and choir were alright. Tracy, Jessica, and I wandered the halls for food and then went back. In band Tracy, Krystal and I wandered the halls again...once again for food...and then we decided to sit in the hall with Greg. That ended up being quite amusing. Greg probably got bored with us...or scared...of us freshmen but oh well. Hes great. Then Tracy grabed Camy's shoe and then we started trying to throw it into the garbage can. It was amusing. Very. LoL So yeah.   Then I came home got online...discovered Ross wasn't on...and I was tryin to think if he said he was gonna be anywhere or something...right then he calls. His stupid internet was down. So yeah we talked for like an hour and a half. Then he realized his parents would probably kill him since he was calling long distance. LoL So yeah. Thats pretty much all that happened today.  -Tara

      Well yes here I am again...with nothing to talk about...but stupid things...yeah. Everything is all confusing these dayz...esspecially with a...few people. Yeah. I think only Tracy and Ashley know what Im talkin bout so yeah. I don't want the whole freakin world to know bout stuff I wanna keep to myself. But yeah that stuff is all confusing me and yeah. Oh well...As long as I go with their ideas or w/e nothing will happen and all shall be good. Hmm...Some people are still mad or w/e at me...but I dont care anymore. Umm..yeah. So in choir we have this song called "Mama Look Sharp" Its kinda...odd..but theres this one part in it that says somethin like "I'll close your eyes my Billy...those eyes that cannot see" keeps goin on n stuff and Tracy and I changed it into many different "bad" forms. LoL Great song now. LoL and Derricks nickname is Billy so that made us laugh even harder...lol..yup...Hmm I really dont have much to ramble about cuz im a loser and have no life...so yeah....I have YC this weekeng..last meeting of this year...*sigh* so I guess Im lookin forward to that...I probably wont write again till I get home...unless something interesting happens...which it wont...since my life is very uneventful. So yeah...later.  -Tara

      Well...its been awhile...and not much to talk about...so I guess I'll just ramble...  Well first thing on my mind is algebra. Some ppl just wont shut up in class which makes the rest of the class do extra work...and half of the talkers dont do all their work anyways. It really makes me mad. Since I do all my work everynight. *Sigh* Yeah....kinda makes a person mad...  Well lately Ive been doing alot of cleaning in my room and this room the computer room. This summer we're gonna redo my room in orange, green, and yellow. It shall be really neat. Plus those are my favorite colors as of now. Then in here we'll probably get a TV and either a couch or a futon or something so then I can just have a hang out place back here...Hopefully a door to this room too...lol..I could just live down here then...a few feet from the fridge...tv computer...itd all be great. lol So yeah thats whats gonna be keeping me busy until summer.   So yeah. School is fine. Gay like normal...only 27 days of school left. That sounds better than June 4th. Oh well it'll go fast..Plus im kinda likin the fact that when Im there I dont eat which makes me skinnier...cuz when im home...parents will make me eat and thats just no fun. So yeah....well i'll stop rambling now...and let you go back to ur life.....  -Tara

      Hmm...Yeah. I've had some friends problems lately...I dunno people just started to get pissed at me n stuff...so I switched lunch tables..to be with some people who'd actually care...but I think that made the others even more angry. *shrug* Atleast now im getting closer with the few I have n stuff...but I dunno its just felt like Ive lost so many. I really don't care anymore...Im getting closer with Ashley which is fine by me since we had that lil talk earlier this week bout how we both kinda felt outta place...well I think Ive found mine now. So yeah. Not much is going on...Ive stoped eating lunch now..Im not even hungry then. I don't get hungry till about 3:30 so its alright. *sigh* Im just really in this depressed like mood *shrug* who knows...maybe im just tired. Tracy and I are working on our song with is coming along great. Yeah Pineapple. Its gonna go to the tune of Yeah Toast. Good times...yeah...heres what she pretty much thought of for now...  When the first Hawaiian got really hungry Didn't know what would go with his --- Musta been a retard got it in his head Buy the frickin pineapple shove it in your mouth get fed!  So yeah its amusing..we still need the other verses and some random words but it'll turn out great...so yeah I guess thats all for now...im super bored....and maybe I should go look for some food.....  -Tara

Frist off my Grandpa Frick..he has something wrong with his neck..might have to have surgery...he is always cold and doctors dont know why and they found a spot of cancer in him...*sigh*...then today they found out the my Grandma Frick...has a hole in her eye. Doctors don't have a clue how she got it...just last week she noticed her eye was all blury...so she probably will have surgery this Thursday over in Sioux Falls. *sigh*...Then onto me. Somethins up with me again I woke up and my heart was racing extreamly fast...and I couldnt breathe all to well...Well later on I could breathe better I just couldnt take deep breaths. I went to my aunts and had her check me out. She said my heart rate was above normal but my lungs seem alright. *sigh* We're all just falling apart. *sigh* Not much else to talk about except that thingy we went to today. I actually got something out of it...lol Might sound odd...but it actually made me think and make some new desisons...So yeah...blah...thats all for now....  -Tara

      Best Weekend Ever!  Omg this weekend was -the- best. Sunday was alright...Easter breakfast n all...yeah only had like 3 hours of sleep but thats okay. It went fine. It was kinda boring at my Grandmas since it was only Cody, Cassie and I but it was alright. Cody read Cassie stories...and hung with the old ppl like normal. lol. Then I made Jesse make his dip cuz its soo wonderful...and I was eating it as I was walking out the door. We were running late to go meet Kait. But they didn't wait too long...we were only about 15 minutes late. So we get to Humboldt about 7 and we sit around and get on the computer for awhile. I talk to Ross just sayin normal stuff...so he wouldn't think anything was up and then I said I was gonna go on a walk...  So Kait and I walk to his house...a block away we were both like "OMG I have buterflies in my stomach" so we walk around his block and decide to go to the front door. He answers the door and it was just funny cuz he was like what do you want? cuz he only saw Kait and then he saw me and was like What are you doing here! lol It was great. So we stay at his house for awhile...we went over to the park and walked in the fountain...and sum other stuff...then we rented a movie and Kait and I got back to her house about 11:30...Then we stayed up till like 1ish just talkin bout random stuff and watching the food channel. Good stuff....  This morning I woke up around 7:30...which is super early for me. Quite odd. Yeah and Jessica was comin down the stairs and she waved at me....lol then Kait didn't wake up till like 8 so I just layed around for awhile. Round 9 we finally decide we should get up and we hit the showers. When Kait was in the shower I played pollys with Jessica and we messed around with this awesome glitter stuff and got it everywhere. Amuzing...Then we walked to Ross' house and then we went out to eat at Changs. Yes I ate Chinese aren't you proud of me? lol Then we stayed at Ross' house till bout 4:30...not doing much...Looked at some really cute pictures. Hehe. And I stole a pair of his shoes which are super comfy. And huge. LoL. So yeah...it was a great fun weekend...to bad its over...only 18 days till I see both of them again. *sigh* I can't wait....  -Tara

      Hmm. Isnt it funny how your emotions can change...just like that? Always happens to me...  Just a few minutes ago...I was happy as I could be. Everything was going great. Then some old...stuff came up and I felt like I was being stabbed with a knife. I wish I had someone to talk to. Someone who would understand it all without getting angry or anything. Its just that one subject...no matter what...Someone always gets mad at me. Why can't they see my side of this? Can't they understand that this stuff hurts me? *Sigh* If only I did have someone...a real best friend to talk this all through with...but I don't.  They have all fell for this little spell I guess only I can see through. Maybe because it hurts me...and yeah. I know once someone reads this they are gonna know what im talking about and get pissed. Eh I can't even talk to this measly piece of shit. It listens....but others read....and there goes it all. If only for a few minutes I could share my side of the story for once. Once someone listens to me without getting angry...or talking back. If only they could listen. But I know...I have no one to do that with. I can't even trust my own mother anymore. I used to tell her stuff like this...but she even turned on me...That was proved a few months ago...where once again...I lost a friend.  *sigh* Life sucks doesn't it? I guess I could always just keep it all inside...But...*Sigh* I dunno anymore...If I tell someone....sooner or later...it'll come around and stab me in the back....I know this...because its happend many times before.....MANY. So yeah. I guess I've let all emotion out. Please...don't get mad at me...Thats all I ask. I just needed to let this out and I did...*sigh*  Im sorry for all that Ive done...I should have never wrote this in the first place...im such a bad person...*Sigh* If only I was better....if only.....  -Tara

      I'm super bored...so I guess I'll write...  Last night I had to go to church for Maundy Thursday...and Howard as his normal self it was an hour and 45 mins long. I got soo bored. And I couldnt even see the candle thingy...cuz I was in the choir loft and the piano was right in front of me. So yeah. It was long. Then I caught a ride to the Methodist Church with Alic and Sandy so we could practice for the Good Friday service. Both Trinity and Methodist High School kids put it on...and yeah. I'm a bystander so all I have to do is stand up and shout a few words. It'll be easy. But we practiced for almost an hour and it got boring...Tho the first time we went through it no one could stop laughing...so it was pretty interesting..Cuz Shana and Kim sing the solo parts n stuff and they couldnt stop laughing so everyone that was in the back room joined in. It was quite amusing. So yeah I have to be there at 5:30 tonight so we can go through it all again. Another long night at church. Only 2 and a half hours tonight...last night I was there for 3 and a half so yeah. Otherwise nothing else is going on except that I have to work and do shit around the house all day. If I'm not a good girl I won't be able to do anything...and that will make me extreamly pissed. *sigh* So I guess...nothin else is goin on....  -Tara

It is soo cute now! I love it. And its super short now. I love short hair. Tho long would be nice...but I dont have enought patience to let it grow all out. So I guess I'll be short-ish forever. I'll make my daughter have long hair. lol So yeah...otherwise nothing new is up except Im in another fight with my dad. He wont let me do anything durring our break but sit here at home. *sigh* Im trying to get through to him...and It just might work.

Oh well...anyways Spanish we took a quiz and translated stories...There were some pretty interesting ones...like one about Bill Clinton, french fries and Bigbird. Fun stuff...I also probably failed a Science test today. I can't remember formulas. Oh well. It shouldnt hurt my grade to much. Hmm...then nothing interesting happened...until band. Like I said I forgot my horn so I used Kali's trombone and Karls mouth piece. Yuck. LoL oh well I barely played anyways...So yeah Mr Musel was going on about large group contest...and he said the first weekend in May. I fliped. First weekend in May is the very last YC Meeting for this year. So I was extreamly pissed for along time...until supper when I looked on the schedual and it said....May 8th *sigh* Thank God!  Otherwise today has been Great! Had a wonderful I mean  wonderful  talk with Kaitlyn. :D Im soo happy. We have this wonderful plan...that hopefully will work out...It shall be interesting...So yeah...I guess thats all for now...Must go suck up to my parents...lol...  later, -Tara

      Well finally my weekend of music is over.  Yesterday morning I had to get up early and get to the school for the solo and small group contest. I was in the Brass Choir and we got a 1. I knew we would. We did good...So yeah. That made me happy.  The rest of the day was just kinda laid back...cleaned the library and practiced the organ for about an hour.  Today was just...blah. Got up early for church...tho none of the alarms in our house worked....so I got up 15 mins before I had to be there. Woops. Oh well..I made it in time. Then after church I came home changed and went out to eat at Petes with the Hansen family. Then I came home changed again and went to my piano recital. I was sooo nervous...I couldnt stop shaking. But everything turned out great. I did super good on the organ. Everyone loved it. *sigh* They'll probably want me to play at chruch all summer. Ugh. Oh well. I'm getting good at it. Then I came home and changed AGAIN. Eh 4 different outfits today. lol. And then went to my Grandma Hansens for our lil Easter kidna thing. We just ate and got fat. And now here I am....So thats all for now....  -Tara

      Well here I am...First off a big Happy Birthday out to my cousin Katie. Yes yes I love her much. On to other matters....  Yesterday as you all know was April Fools Day. I swear it was the best one ever. I haven't had that much fun in a long time. Ross and I told his friend Andrew that I was pregnant and Ross wasn't the father. Fun stuff. He actually fell for it...and cared...it was great. I also told him I didn't know who the father was. It was amusing. Then he started thinking...hey this is April Fools Day and then we told him that yeah most of it was a lie...but I was really pregnant and Ross was the father. He kinda still fell for it. Yeah it was soo much fun. I laughed and had a great time.   Just so you all know. Im  not  pregnant. Just to keep that straight...lol  Last night was the Brotherhood Beef Supper at church. I had to work n such but it was fun. I washed dishes with my Grandma, mom, Keith and Beryl Marra...and a few other people. We had a good time...but boy we're my hands dry afterwards. Then we ate n such and it was yummy like normal. I love it. lol I think we had a pretty good turn out too...so thats good.  Today was just one good day. I had alot of fun. I don't know why...Im just SO happy! Its a great feeling. Jon gave me a ride home and we took the gravel road...not a good choice..he was goin like 70...and we almost went in the ditch..scary! Then we went crusin up town for awhile and he starting passing people...almost hit someone...but it was all good. We listened to Sheltered Reality. Good stuff. LoL yup. I make him give me rides...cuz Im to lazy...and plus I had my gay trombone to carry home. Ugh Contest tomorrow. Oh Joy. I actually have to get up early. Eh it sucks. I have to be there about 9:30...but I don't warm up till 10. Odd. Anyways....I guess thats all for now...  -Tara

      Well today sucked. But it was alright. Its been a very long day. It feels like it should be 8 or something but yeah. *shrug* Well I had to get up really early to get to the school and get everything ready for the parade n stuff. Sucked. We marched thru Hartley to the Cemetary...it was pointless! We didn't even play anything. But we played like 4 songs at the Cemetary so yeah. Then we went to Melvin and played so more...thats when my feet started to bleed cuz my shoes were killing me. Hurt like hell. So yeah. Then we went to May City. That was pointless to. Wow a croud of like 20 people...maybe. Yeah. And it was soooo windy. We were all falling over. It sucked. It was soo cold too. Eh. I hate this. I hope I never have to do it again. It was torture. So yeah I came home to find out that we got the couch n stuff...this room looks totally different. All we need is the TV and It'll all be good. Tho the couch is kinda ugly..but it was free so yeah. I was just in a bad mood when I found out I couldn't have the TV and the comp on at the same time. My parents are dumb. They think it'll start a fire or something. *shrug* W/e...we'll figure something out. So yeah...then I just kicked back the rest of the day. To windy to tan :( So yeah. Well only 4 more days of school/hell. *sigh* I really wanna be done n over with it. Im sooo sick of school. Probably fail every test this week..but does it look like I care? No. I don't give a damn bout school anymore...Once May hit..I've already been out of it. Hence the low Algebra grade. Its only a C but thats super low for me but yeah. I just wanna get out. Hopefully this summer will go better for me. Hopefully I'll have Kait come n stay all of next week and then its the thing in Grinnell so I'll keep busy. I guess thats good. I just need my tan! I look so white right now. :( Oh well I'll get it in time. Well...I have nothing else to ramble bout...

      I finally got away. Thank God. I've been working non stop all day long. Its been a very long Sunday. Tho I finally got to sleep in. That was nice. First Sunday I've missed church probably since last August. *Sigh* Yeah. Well when I did finally get up, Mom and I went and cleaned the Library. Cassie came when we were almost done cuz we had to watch her all afternoon while Donnie and Leslie went up to the flea markets. So when that was done we came home and played dolls with Cassie for awhile since I haven't played with her in awhile and then we started cleaning everything out of this room. And we got everything out. It looks so big now! I can't believe how big it really is. So hopefully soon after we eat we'll go over to Donnie's and get the couch...and then my Dad will attempt to set up wires so when we do get a TV it will all be ready. Then all we need is a door. I don't think we'll get a full door...just a half one like my Aunt Merna Rae has. Its good enough. So yeah...I probably should get going so I can go work somemore. Catch ya later.

      Well today was a pretty laid back day. Got up around 9:30 and just layed around for awhile...Parentals went shopping so I finally got the house to myself. 'Round 12 Kim came over and we just hung out pretty much all day. We barely did anything but sit...yeah Im so lazy. And finally right now my computer started to work. All day it has froze everytime I booted it up. It was really being annoying...but I ran the Adaware and I think that helped it a bunch. I hope there isnt a virus on it. Eh We'll probably have to send it uptown to Dave pretty soon but yeah. Well I guess I really dont have anything else to ramble about so I'll let ya go...

      Well I think Im just gonna get into the habit of writing everyday just because I have nothing better to do. *sigh* Well Im not doing to much right now...buggin Ross for ideas for his birthday which is like less than 2 weeks away. *sigh* Hopefully next Saturday Kait will come and stay all week and we'll go to Sioux Falls and try to find him something...But I dunno when I'll see him so I guess I still have time...*Sigh* Anyways today was kinda crappy...This morning I woke up and felt kinda odd...and the I hoped in the shower and got all dizzy and almost passed out so I got out quick and went to my room and just layed there..my heart was racing and I couldn't breathe. It was scary...I just had all these weird pains and ugh it really sucked. My mom told me I still had to go to school so I pretty much made myself feel better and slowly got ready...but eh I still have those pains. Hurts like hell. For somereason I only feel it when I sit down...Odd. Anyways..school was just blah like normal. Spanish we worked on our scrapbooks...ugh I have to study that all weekend. I have to do good so I can get an A in that class. I need As to even out my Algebra grade. So yeah Science was pretty fun. We starting stuff on fire. Pretty cool. Mr. DeGroot almost blew his hand off tho. Everyone jumped...but it was cool. Very amusing. Homeroom was pretty boring...Ashley wasnt in there so I was stuck there with Derk n Logan. Logan was all blah (probably because Ashley wasnt there but yeah) So it was just...eh...then Algebra was just...grand. Eh. I hate it! Then Choir was just dumb...we're watching Drum Line since shes testing everyone so Tracy and I just sat there and drew on the bottom of my shoes..pretty fun...lol Band was gay we had just put everything away and went outside to sit when the lady came to sing America so we had to all go back in take everything back out and play. Eh it was pointless. I don't wanna go Monday but I have to. *sigh* Then we had a cheerleading meeting. Talked bout how we now have 8 on Varsity and now Jen and I wont just be alone Jessica is with us too. *Sigh* Hopefully if Erica and Sarah quit it'll still be Jen n I but who knows now...*sigh* Oh well...Atleast I had a dream for 2 days. So yeah...I really have nothing else to ramble about so I'll let cha go...  -Tara   Current Song:  The Reason by Hoobastank  Current Mood:  Content

      Hmm....All the sudden it just hit me...I really miss Ross right now. Maybe I kinda helped myself think about it..but yeah. It feels like theres a brick on my chest...I miss him soooo much. *sigh* Its just seemed like forever since I've seen him and it'll probably still be another few weeks...I noticed it more today than any other day how much everything around me reminds me of him. A car...driving by my house made me hold my breath for just a sec today. Theres always that hope of him being there...*sigh* Everywhere I look...there he is. I opened a book today...first thing I saw was Ross. *sigh* Im going crazy aren't I. Even tho he rarely calls me...everytime the phone rings...I once again hold my breath. Eh. I guess I did get myself into this...I was so bored tonight since no one was really on...well atleast no one of interest to talk to..so I started seaching the internet on Humboldt n stuff cuz hey I have no life...and I guess it just hit me. Yeah I know...im stupid but yeah...I just -really- miss him. *sigh*  But otherwise some stuff is good today. I might be on Varsity! :D Because someone complained about 6 on a sqaud so they changed to 8 and that leaves Jen and I as alternates and then 2 chicks might quit cuz they really don't like Duncan and don't get along with her to well so that puts Jen and I right in there. Wow. I never thought I'd ever make it...since I barely accomplish anything but yeah. It would be awesome if I did. I'd get to skip band! woo! lol goodbye marching band! :D lol so yeah if I do it'll just be great fun. We play Fort Dodge this year...odd since we like never have or w/e I think its some Christian school or something *shrug* Hell if I know. But yeah...its close to Humboldt :D. See there I go again...everything...reminds me...  Another good thing bout today is that my Grandpa is doing a whole lot better. But they did find a cancer spot on his kidney so they might just take it out..but hes not cold anymore which is really good...he was scaring us for awhile. So yeah...lots of good news n stuff...except well Im probably gonna end up doin bad in Algebra. I've just been slacking off to much...and yeah...it shows...ive gone down quite a bit but everyother class is an A so it'll all even out. Well I guess I have nothing else to ramble about...

      Well I'm alot happier now. So thats good. Past two days have been really good and I really don't know why. *shrug* maybe because it hasn't rained and the sun has been out so I guess that could be it. So yeah not alot has happened. We have a new pastor here that might become ours and I know who he is cuz he was in Hubbard when we had the Youth Council meeting there. I found out that he has a son named Jon and Im supposedly gonna try to set him up with Kait. Could be interesting. So yeah. Hopefully the 6th Kait will come here and we will go to Sioux Falls shopping and then she'll stay untill the 11th when we go down to Grinnell. Hopefully that will work out. Cuz yeah I dunno when else she could stay. So yeah. Hmm...Today we had a football cheerleading meeting and Duncan had already picked out the sqaud just cuz there wasnt enough time for tryouts now that school is almost out so ofcourse im not on cuz she picked almost the same people from last year. But im an alternate and I'll still practice but I dunno if we'll have enough for a JV sqaud or not cuz right now its only Jen and I so who knows whats gonna happen next year. *shrug* But we'll still get to help for Homecoming and probably cheer then. So theres still stuff to look forward to. Then I'll defenatly make varsity the next year cuz there wont be very many girls out anymore so yeah. It'll be all good. Yup. Yesterday I got my schedual for next year and Im gonna die 2nd quarter. *sigh* I have Biology, World History and Algebra 2. Might be kinda hard...Probably will be...but I have stuff with friends so Im not gonna go switch it or anything. I'll just live with it next year. So yeah. I really don't know what else to talk about...only 5 and a half more days....I hope they go fast...I wanna be done with school! Eh stupid Memorial Day Parade on Monday...its soo gonna suck. Since my parents hate me they wont let me get out of it...so I'll be the only trombone. Oh joy. Eh maybe I wont play...I mean I shouldnt even have to go....I already added my points up...and put them in...Nobody would know....anyways....I'm gonna go...  -Tara

      *sigh* Well I just got back from Graduation and it was good...slide show was great...but it made me tear up n stuff. Im just a softie. Anything makes me cry...I've cried everyday this week...I guess I've just been down for various reasons. *sigh* Now I know all of you who read this are gonna say different and say you're always there to talk to n stuff I know you're there but still I dunno what it is..but something is still missing. If only you knew what it was like to live one day in my shoes...feel the pain I feel everyday. *sigh* I guess one main thing is...I really don't have a super close friend...You all have someone else. I know this may sound stupid but I get tired of keeping everything inside. Thats why im in so much pain. I have no time in the day to let my feelings out...so they stay bottled up inside. It hurts you know...it really does. None of you have any idea how many times I've cried myself to sleep in my life...because I don't have that one close friend here...None of you know how many times I've prayed my dad would find a new job...just so we could move and I could start over. None of you know...how many times...I wish my life ended. *sigh* Its a good thing I got into church and started Youth Council. If not..who knows where I'd be today. I know treasure each day I have here...well not really Hartley but just here...on earth. I just live my life looking forward to the next meeting or next trip...and if thats how I have to carry on through highschool...so be it. I can live it out...I can fake those smiles and laughs...I have for one whole year...Most of you probably don't know how many times I went to school right after a huge fight with my parents or just plain hurting...I cover it up...sometimes I just can't...Sometimes I just let it all out...like oh 2 weeks ago in algebra...I just let it out....starting crying...but it ended up alright....only Mr Wallinga and Mayu knew I still tried to hide it but yeah. I guess Im just in a down mood today for some reason...weather tends to bring me down to...thats why I swear I have that S.A.D. But I'll never know...It just brings up another fight with the parentals...so yeah. Another thing that brought me down was last night at my cousins graduation party. My cousin Brooke brought her boyfriend along and yeah...everyone had someone else that whole night...Theres just no one else my age in our family..well sure theres Cody and Scott...but they are always with each other so yeah. It just hit me that I really missed Ross alot last night. I can't wait for this summer...school problems will end and I can just be myself...not hide...and have a great time...I hope thats how it will go...but yeah im gonna go lighten up my mood and go to a movie with my little cousin Cassie. She always brings a smile to my face...so hopefully the next time I write I'll be a little bit happier...Im out.  -Tara

      Well its been awhile. This week has been...well...bad. Wednesday a guy in my school commited suicide. It brought down the whole school...I admit it made me depressed n stuff but it totally changed my mind bout that. I don't know what I was thinking when I used to think of it. I now realize theres more to life...nothing can be so bad that I have to do that...but I'll admit physical pain does make the pain inside go away...but yeah. I know alot of people dont get that but it really is true. I've experienced that. So yeah this week has been really odd...people have been alot quieter at school n stuff...*sigh* its just been weird...But yeah I really have had a new outlook on life...it made me realize alot of things...So yeah I feel good about life now...I realize what a good life I have and how good I have it...So yeah. I guess I really don't have much more to say...so I'll write more later...  May 19,2004 Rod Rice   -Tara

      Oh wow. And I thought yesterday was shitty...today was ten times worse...by far. God I hate myself right now. I hate my life. I hate Hartley. *sigh* I actually like YC just because they dont judge you for wrong reasons. Theres no popularity contest there. *sigh* I wish I could just blow everything off my mind but I can't. Well for one thing theres like nobody to talk to about it. Hmmm..theres another problem. *sigh* so many people are getting on my nerves. Everyone is all cranky cuz they want school to yet out...dont blame ya I wanna get out too but you don't have to bitch at everyone..gosh I was just asking for a freakin piece of paper today and someone like fliped out. Have a Goddamned Cow! *sigh* Another thing I realized...I don't have any friends or like anything anymore. Theres a whole 2 people here I can talk to...Tracy and Ashley. Im like not close with anyone else and/or everyone else hates me. W/E. Im just so sick n tired of it. I really don't care anymore. If only I could move away. Hartley has had enough of me. To much maybe. But since theres no chance of me moving..I guess I'll I have to live thru the next 3 years. *sigh* I dunno if I can make it. I dont even have a social life anymore...I don't get invited to anything...Well I guess thats cuz I don't have any friends. *sigh* I can't even find a frickin locker partner for next year. *sigh* Im just a horrible person. I wish I was better....in many ways...I just need a life. or a best friend...Kait always tells me we're best friends and I know we are but still...not having one in your town...your school...its different. I guess I've just never been the same since Tori left. She was the greatest friend. She moved on..she found another best friend...but me...no. *sigh* Feels like nobody in the world cares. Dont you ever feel that way? Right now Im in just a low that it feels like not one person gives a damn. I know its not true...I know theres a few people that do...but not all...thats for sure. *sigh* I don't even know why I feel this way...Im like in tears for no reason. I just wish people at school would leave me alone...maybe I can just go through my day at school being a loner...wait I already do...Well if not...it sure feels that way. *sigh* I dunno. Everything would be all better if I moved...not far...just somewhere that I wouldnt have these gay problems...people that didn't know my past...a fresh start...thats what I need...but not on all...theres only one good decsion I've made in my life...only one. And I thank God for it everyday. Im glad I was smart last summer...I just dont't know what to do with my life now....  -Tara

      Hmm...So its been awhile and I have like nothing to write about but I really need to write. My mind is full of shit that I dont feel like thinking about right now so hopefully this will help. So yeah. Not much has been goin on. 14 more days of school...I'll probably end up failing Algebra cuz of the test I took Friday. My parents will kill me. *sigh* My life has been kinda sucky lately but oh well. I barely remember what happened last week. Is that sad? Yeah. Mr. Musle was gone a few days last week so in band Tracy, Camy and I hung out. We talked about everything and it was quite amusing. They also got a little crazy with the markers and they wrote all over my legs. I had "HOT!", "Tan me!" "And ME" and a whole bunch of arrows on my legs and then Jen and Paige drew on my arms and Paige had fun coloring my shoes and yeah it was interesting. I had piano that night and Julie just looked at me weird but thats okay. So yeah. On friday Tracy and I created a new game. Ghetto Shooter. Very amusing. We didn't have to do anything durring choir and we were in the gym so we got pony tail holders and started shooting em around and then one got stuck in the basketball hoop so we tried getting more stuck and we did and it was just great fun. We couldnt stop saying Timmy either. Timmy from South Park. Yeah. Very amusing. And in band we sat around some more and I wrote the part of our song "Yeah Pineapple" all over her arm. We are gonna try to record it soon. It'll be awesome. We're thinking maybe we could have a talk show someday and just have it all stupid with our stupid dumb things we say n do. So yeah. Friday night I stayed with Kim and we were bored so we went for a walk and picked up some red bull on the way. Gosh I was wide awake like all night. Damn that stuff works good. I love it! So yeah we went to the park to bring back memories and we started telling jokes n stuff so I brought up the one Jacob told at YC bout the Foo birds shiting...anyways after I told it I stood up cuz we were gonna start heading home and I looked down on my arm and what did I see? Bird Shit. Gosh that joke was a curse! lol yeah so I almost barfed and Kim laughed and we walked home to wash it off. So yeah that was amusing. Then on Saturday Kim and I went shopping didnt get much just a new purse and a ring cuz its awesome LoL. So yeah then that night I babysat for my sweetie pie who wasnt feelin so good. Poor thing. I couldn't get her to eat but I got her to drink a lil bit but then she got up took the bowl with her to the bathroom and then starting barfing. I can handle it. Wow. I didnt even feel like I was gonna get sick or anything. I just pulled her hair outta her face and made her feel better...after that she was okay but yeah. So I guess I passed that test. LoL I can handle little kids n barf...so yeah. Well today not much has been goin on...Ashley came over and we filled out all of our crap for NYE. It took us like 2 hours. But we kinda got sidetracked alot to but yeah. It was fun. Also tonight I've been pissed for alot of reasons but yeah I dont wanna go into them all cuz Im actually feeling alot better now. I really wanna go write a story. Its an odd urge that I have. So yeah. I guess I wrote alot bout junk. So I'll let you all go back to ur normal lives now.......  -Tara

      Well its me again...heres a lil update on the past few days  Friday: Good fun day...we had a 1 hr late start cuz teachers had this meeting talkin bout how we need to improve our school...So I got to sleep in and it was all good. I was feeling alot better...and it was just a good day. That night went over to Swensons for awhile...just hung out not doing much...so yeah that was Friday.  Saturday: Got up -super- early and got to the school at 7. Went to Emmetsburg for our contests and we got a 1 for band and a 1 for choir. So yeah...I hung out with Tracy all day...it was fun cuz I dont get to see her much...so yeah...it was just a good fun day...very hot...and we had to wear hose...I havent worn that in forever...eh it sucked...but we all looked tan..so yeah I came home and sat outside worked on my tan a lil more and then just watched tv all night..  Sunday:Eh Mothers Day. I must be the worst daughter in the world. *sigh* oh well...we went over to visit my grandma who had eye surgery and has to keep her head down all the time...she was feeling a little better so thats good...then I had to babysit my sweetheart. We went to the park for over an hour and all she wanted to do was swing...so my arms are sore from pushing her alot. But it was fun. She was being so cute. Then went over to Hansens...sat around and ate. Rachel Katie and I went to the basement where it was cool and watched some tv...then last night we had big storms and i hate bad weather. Eh. It was one big dust storm. And a few people I know said they saw a few tornados...eh. I hate those. Anyways thats all that happened sunday...  Today: Eh. It was alright...nice and hot out. School was boring like normal...and in algebra I got all fed up and kinda had a break down. Oh well...Mr Wallinga helped me and its all good. I came home and sat outside for 2 hours and thats about all that happened....I'll write again when something interesting happens...which nothing really does...all I know now is that Kait is goin to the Annual meeting so I wont be alone...tho last year I really wasnt..but I'll just keep that to myself...lol me n church things I tell ya...anyways...later.  ~Tara

      Well Im back...I've been sick for awhile and I still am...but I have nothing to do. I've watched so much TV lately its givin me a headache. So yeah I hate being sick. I kinda just hate my life right now but *shrug* everythings alright...just more fighting n stuff the normal...So yeah....Yesterday I went to school for a half day and I barely made it thru that much. The drugs I've been takin I think is Benadryl make me really tired and I kept fallin asleep during boring Science. Yeah. Ashley and I were gonna order cheese balls from the drive in yesterday and have those for lunch but her brother was asleep and we couldnt find anyone to go get them for us. So yeah...then I felt really crappy and I came home. My mom was kinda pissed cuz she like never lets me stay/come home unless im like barfin every 2 mins or i have a 102 temp. *shrug*  Anyways I slept for about 2 hours and then just layed around watchin TV. I finally saw the video to my favorite song. I've been waiting forever to. But it doesnt fit the song at all *shrug* oh well...I heart that song. Tho since I was in a crappy mood yesterday it made me cry and it hasnt made me cry in a long time but w/e. Anyways bout 7 I fell asleep again and woke up bout 9 and wandered up to bed...and then didnt wake up till 10 this morning. My dad thinks im sick because I haven't had alot of sleep lately and I don't get any exercise so my body takes it hard. *shrug* Im just mad that im sick on a nice hot day. I wish I could go outside n tan but eh I can't. I just want school to be out and summer to be here. Summer is always the best. Hopefully this summer will be a good one...Cuz im always happy in the summer...well atleast I like to be...I dont wanna cry this summer...So hopefully everything goes right...but I guess you never know do ya...*sigh* well Im still feeling kinda sick...so I shall go back to the couch for now......  -Tara

      Im really in alot of pain right now. Im such a horrid person. I think I just lost another friend...*sigh* Im so bad...It feels like I just got stabbed in the heart...Im in tears...Im so horrible. If I died tonight not ONE person would care...not one. Cuz of all the pain I have caused everyone. *sigh* No wonder I have no friends...I screw em all. Damn. I hate myself. Im so bad. I HATE MYSELF. How could I let myself do this. I've done so much wrong im my life. Nobody will ever forgive me. Right this moment I feel like not one person cares. I cant believe im so bad. I wish I woulda realized it. Now I have. And as I just told Kait 'You should shoot me before I do anything else wrong' I dunno if I'll ever be able to forgive myself.  If only I could redo everything...*sigh* I really hate myself for all of this...im sorry that Im in love...and just wanna be with him. Im sorry if that fucks everything up. Im sorry that I hurt so many people without realizing it. Gosh. *sigh* I dunno what to do anymore....I feel like curling up in a ball and just continue crying and just stay that way for a long time...Heh. I guess maybe I needed a reality check...I guess thats what I got. I hate myself for this...Im soo sorry to everyone...everyone that I've hurt...which is probably alot....probably more than I know. Nobody has any idea how my heart is hurting right now....This pain is the worst. Realizing you've done so much wrong in so little time. Hurting people...friends close to you...that hurts....Maybe I should be the one to quit Youth Council. Just cuz thats where it seems to be the worst...*sigh* I don't know what to do anymore...   -Hurt and Confused.

      Well I guess I shall update on this weekend...it was great...except im all tired and crap so yeah...if it dosent sound like i had fun...well i did...So yeah...Jon Jess and I left Hartley about 10 Saturday morning for Corning. We picked up Megan somewhere I dont remember and got down to the church about 2:30. We got there and nobody was there so we stood outside doing cartwheels and random stuff for about 20 mins until Katie showed up with Walter, Ashlee, and Jacob. Walter and Jacob got lost. LoL. Then we couldnt get the church unlocked...lol...So we stood around some more. Walter played with the bell and his head was a little to close to it when it rang so he screamed and ran. LoL Then finally we were givin up on the door so Walter broke in and we all rejoiced. So we just sat around...doing nothing. Ross and Kait came and then that was about it for our crowd. It was alright tho. Its alot of fun when theres only a handful of people there. So we talked about how the rally went and how we are gonna do stuff for NYE. Then we went out to eat in Creston and then went bowling. I did really bad lol. Oh well...I havent bowled in over a year...so yeah. Then we went back to the church and just hung out and watched movies until late...and fell asleep really late like normal. Then before we knew it, it was morning and we had to shower at peoples houses and then go to church. Church actually was pretty interesting...I actually listened! lol So yeah then it was time to leave and it was sad...and I cried....and then slept almost the whole way home...so yeah thats bout all that happened...it was good...*nod*....but I had no idea when Im gonna see Ross again...*sigh* Oh well pretty soon he can drive and then we can see each other more...hopefully...*sigh*  -Tara

      Well yesterday turned out fine. I realized that I only get sad-ish at night n stuff...anyways....yesterday was good...finished my room all up...IT IS AWESOME! I heart it! It looks soo cool! We left on wall just yellow and the rest are sponged orange n green. It looks great. Can't wait for it to be normal again. We also re aranged my room...it'll be weird but now the couch can fold out into a bed so it'll work great when people come over n stay. So yeah thats pretty much all I did today...tho Kim came over and we did a work out that was on Fit TV. Haha...We were bored...it was amusing. So yeah. *sigh* Well Im going camping today with Tracy. It'll be tons of fun. Even tho I'll probably get called chunky by the guys up there again. *sigh* Fat...yes. I am. Eh. Oh well...So I probably wont get to write again till the 7th of July. Heh...thats supposedly when Im supposed to get married...Kim did this thing and it said that was the date....odd. Anyways. I'll give ya all the details bout my fun time when I get home...Maybe Tracy and I will do another fun foot thing...or finish our song. It'll be great fun. Sad thing is...I can't watch the cubs game today to see if I can see Ross...We leave before it starts...:( I thought it woulda been awesome to see him on tv...but I guess I can't Oh well...*sigh* I guess I have nothing else to ramble about and I'll catch ya in a week...

      Yes. I know. Its 2 am. But Im to...depressed/moody to sleep. *sigh* I don't know what got into me..but I just got all teary n stuff. Eh. I was just happy not to long ago...and now...Im all downhill. I should be all happy n excited because I finish my room tomorrow and then going camping with Tracy on Wednesday. I don't know why Im so down. Ross? Probably. I just miss him way to much...and it hurts more n more everyday. Only 3 weeks till I see him. Thats -way- to long. *sigh* Another reason im probably down-ish...is cuz the only thing I've listened to in the past hour is the Reason. Dumb me. I know it gets me down sometimes...puh. Im just emotional. Way to emotional. *sigh* It seems like I complain bout missin Ross to much...Im sorry...its probably annoying or "old" but eh...I have no other way to express feelings...so here they go...So anyways...Im just feeling quite down tonight....hopefully when I write again I'll be up and happy....Hopefully.

      Parents are good for somethings...Like getting you something you really want...and its  a surprise. I -heart- surprises! My Dad got me the Hoobastank CD! :D Im soo happy! I love it! :D *sigh* Today ended up being pretty dang good! I've just been in a weird kinda happiness lately. Dunno why. Tho the other night I was in tears...but yeah. So today...Got up round 8 and went to Spencer to get some more paint for my room. Came home and painted...I got all done by 2:30. So all of my walls are bright yellow now. Pretty neat. I think it really looks cool with the white boarder alone but tomorrow we get to start with orange and then green. Its gonna be interesting. Hope it turns out good! But yeah...Its soo bright! So Kim came over and helped me for awhile and then we sat around doin random stuff and laughing alot. Then mom and I went on a walk...saw some people who I don't really like. Like the chick who trashed me on the internet. Eh. Anyways then I went to Kims and we sadly watched "Who Wants To Marry My Dad" We had fun pickin the girls apart n stuff. Who was ugly, who was to young....all that stuff...so yeah. So then I got home...found out the computer has a virus. Ugh. But I can't get rid of it till I unplug our internet n stuff. So I can do that between painting n stuff. So then my Dad gave me this CD I was soo happy! :D Love it! Ahh...happiness....for awhile atleast...Not talkin to Ross for a week...might kill me.  I suppose I will live. Maybe. LoL Oh and A  very  Happy Birthday to my wonderful friend Kait. Sweet Sixteen! :D Loved You First! ;)  Tara   Current Music:  Just One by Hoobastank  Current Mood:  Happy  Quote of the Day:  "You must have been a cow in a past life cuz you really seem to like cows." -Kim

Kim came over and saved me for awhile...we went to the church and "practiced the organ" haha. Actually we went to the drive-in and got icecream. LoL Which reminded me...that was the first icecream cone I had, had since last July. Sad. Yeah. So then people started showing up here for my uncles party...He turns 50 today...Heh...My Dads B-day is today to. I think hes 54...or 53 somethin like that...Old Fart! lol Yeah so then I went over and babysat Cassie. Fun like normal. Plus it was cash. Ahh..money..lol. We watched monsters inc and then some tv...I tried to get her to go to bed but she wanted mommy...which is normal so she sat in the chair with me and fell asleep in my arms. Ahh I love that. First time I held her she fell asleep in my arms. Love it. Its so comforting. Ahh can't wait to have kids. *sigh* Anyways She finally went to sleep and I got soo bored that I actually watched....Baseball tonight. Sad huh?

      Well today...should I say yesterday was just...great. I woke up around 12 and cleaned in my room all afternoon. Eh I got most everything off my shelves and everything off my dressers. It looks so empty in there! Oh and I counted all the pictures I had on my wall. 307. I had 307 pictures on my wall. Woo! Yeah...I read the newsletter today. Last one of Howards. I cried. *sigh* Im really gonna miss him. He helped me thru so much...and gives me so much crap bout Ross. *sigh* Im glad he confirmed me. July 18th will just really be a sad Sunday for me. Mom and I will be bawling our eyes out by the end. *sigh* On to happier issues. My Grandpa came home from the hospital today. Hes doin great! I think he was happy to be home and that made him feel better. Im glad hes doing good...cuz I dunno what I woulda done if something happened to him. So yeah we went over and saw him after supper. Before supper Kim came over and we talked and did some stuff on the computer...Then after supper Mom and I went on our walk and Jeff and Nathan went by on their mopeds and Nathan yelled "I can't take my eyes off of you!" Eh. Hes crazy. *Shakes head* Then round 8 I went over to Kims and we watched How To Deal...again. For like the hundreth time. We quoted almost the whole thing.  And theres just this one scene that really makes me think of Ross. *sigh* I miss him soo much! I really wanna see him soon. But im not going to. :'( *sigh* So then I came home and I sat on the computer until now...I think my Dads gonna kick me off soon. Eh like this is late! Half the time im online till 3. Gur. Hes annoying sometimes. *sigh* Well I better head off now...  Tara   Current Music:  none  Current Mood:  emotional  Quote of the Day:  "Kim, your cans are hard!" LOL

      Wow Kim and I had the best time tonight! And all day actually. She came over round 1. First time I saw her since Ross's birthday. We talked and she gave me a present that she picked up for me while she was on vacation. Woo red n black tanktop! Love it! :D Its great. Then she hung out here and round 3:30 we left for Spencer. We had a great time. We went to Shoppers and found cute tank tops. They are fun! They have hoods and are just great. Then we went to Wal-Mart n places and went out to eat at KFC. Ahh chicken....Then we went to the mall. Kim and I decide to go to White Chicks and Julie and James go to Harry Potter. So we had an extra hour to walk around..so we just went to different stores and all the sudden a group of 3 guys walk by and say "Hey hey..." We just laughed and kept goin. Then another group of 3 guys came by and said "Hey!" We laughed again. The second group of guys then droped a dime by us so we'd pick it up n stuff so we'd have to bend over infront of them...but we didn't we just kept goin. Then we ran into the first group again. Kim and I were wearing pink n red shirts so they started calling us that. They did atleast 3 times. It was interesting. So we had a total of 6 guys hitting on us tonight....*twitch* So then we went to the movie and one of the guys was in there and he kept lookin back at us. I quickly put on the band sweatshirt to represent that I was TAKEN. Yeah. The movie was great. Kim and I laughed alot. I haven't had that much fun in a long time...we just laughed none stop! Great stuff....so then we got home and I stayed at her house for a lil while and I just got home...so yeah that was my interesting, fun, girls night out.

      Today...well...I didn't go to bed till about 3..Im never tired at night....*shrug* I was just really hungry lol....so I slept as long as I could. I think I finally rolled outta bed a lil before 1. LoL Then I got to work....I got my closet looking really nice...I took all my stuffed animals and put them in a big TV box. They filled the whole thing....So I put most of my shoes on those shelves...and I got all my dolls n barbies all nice in boxes all pilled up in the back and now you can walk in there! I just dont know what im going to do with all those animals...hmm...I'll think later...It looks nice in there now so thats all that matters....Now the rest of the week I get to take everything I mean everything off my walls...shelves, my desk (its a hanging one..odd but *shrug*) tons of posters...all that good stuff. I only have 6 pictures left on my wall...:( Im sure gonna miss all those. They were like wallpapered on there. Im gonna count how many I had up but Im pretty sure it was near 250. Not sure tho. I'll figure it out later. So yeah...I did that all afternoon. Then Grandma H picked me up round 5:45 so we could go out to eat and to the summer theater up at the lakes. We ate at Mrs Ladys...yummy. I haven't ate there since Meghans B-day party a few years back. I had yummy nachos and ofcourse sopapillas (its spelled all weird i dunno...lol) Then we went to the play. It was actually really good. Tho they screwed up our tickets...but it worked out fine. They had a raffle goin on and they picked my cousin Rachel and she got an airfreshener lol and a picture with the *cough*hot*cough* guy...lol sorry. I didn't really mean that...But yeah. We had a good time. Katie was my date tonight LOL. I have so much fun with her....shes in what...6th grade now. Shes my bud. So yeah then Grandma and I had DQ on the way home...I got my normal Mint Oreo. Yum. Tho her driving kinda got me car sick so I doubt I'll be havin that kind for awhile....So yeah. Thats all thats been goin on....catch ya later.

      I just have to write again...to many emotions...and since this is how I get my feelings out...I will. Im happy, then sad, then hurt, then in tears, then excited. God whats wrong with me!?! Well I was happy and havin fun when I babysat tonight...I watched Cassie and her friend Kaitlyn. We had fun...they rode bike around and played ball...hide n go seek. All those fun games. It was really alot of fun...Cassie didn't want me to leave...shes so cute. She said "I wish mommy and daddy would never come home cuz I love Terri." So cute. Stuff like that just makes ya feel good. Shes a doll. She wants me to stay over night saturday night...but I dunno...since I'll only get to see 2 of Howard sermons and then hes gone! :( Im sooo gonna cry that day. That will be one of the worst days....*blinks back tears* Eh. Im dumb. If I wasnt the secretaries daughter I wouldnt get so close to them...but I do. Anyways...I left Cassie and got home and Tracy asked me to go camping with her over the 4th. Ross said fine since he had family coming up. Its probably good that I didn't go cuz only thing I hear bout down there is Hawaii this or that. I dunno why it gets to me...it just gets old. Kait said all I talked bout the other weekend was Ross...well all she talked bout was "when Ross and I go to Hawaii this or that" I dunno...just kinda...felt like someone was stomping on my heart. *shrug* But yeah. Im excited bout goin camping with Tracy. It was so much fun last year...even tho we got burnt really bad. LoL. So hopefully we dont peel again...Tho Camy had fun pickin all of our dead skin off...haha. That was interesting...I also caught my first fish last year. WOo...go me! Yeah. So now I don't get to see Ross till July 20th...19th if my mom sets it up *sigh* That means I don't even get to see him on our 1 year anniversary. :( That day will totally suck. *sigh* I guess he'll get his b-day present a month and a half late and his anniversary present a week late...*sigh* I wouldnt care if he didnt get me anything....just to see him would be heaven..but doubt it will happen. Another thing...I dont get to see any of his games...:( stupid weather. *sigh* Makes me sad. I probably wont get my b-day wish either....But if he could come on the 8th -10th Id be happy....Hope he does...otherwise that weekend will really suck. Me alone at home till late hours with nothing to do...no one to be with....*sigh* Oh well...I guess I'll stop complaining...I just had to many emotions inside..and this helped me let them all out....so yeah...later all.

      Well last night was an interesting night at the Hansen home. WE ACTUALLY ALL GOT ALONG! :-0 Yeah. Mom and I worked in my room for a good 2 hours and we finally called it quits cuz we were both just worn out. And by that time my algergies were kickin in and my throat hurt from coughin so much. And on top of it all the computer pissed me off. Stupid mouse! It annoys me. At night it doesnt seem to want to work. *shrug* Anyways I got off and laid on the couch for awhile...and all the sudden my dad comes down asking who threw his underwear in the garbage. My mom and I died laughing...cuz while we were cleaning my room mom brought the laundry upstairs and tired to give me this pair...I claimed they werent mine. I said they were hers cuz they looked old lady like. Heh I give her crap bout bein old all the time. LoL But she swore they were mine she said they were low cut. So I was like "Bullshit!

I haven't laughed so hard in forever...my mom was bawling...It was just hilarious. All my mom could say while she was wipping away tears was "I can't wait to tell Ross that you were wearing mens underwear." *sigh* Well I had to prove my point to her...and I did. *nod* So I finally went to bed round 12 and I still had to find my bed and make it...it was buried in shit! Anyways....  So I got up round 9:30 this morning and went out to organ lessons. I actually did good this week cuz I actually practiced. Yay for me! lol Then came home and made myself some mac n cheese....I had a super craving for that. Then when mom went to work I did some work around the house and laid out for a good 2 hours.

      Fathers Day. Well Im a bad daughter but not to bad...I actually got my Dad something. I got him a eagle t-shirt and a bag of caramel kisses. He ate all of those within an hour...*shakes head* So yeah. Got up early and went to church...Mom and I gave Howard a Garfield beanie baby so we both got hugs from him. *sigh* Im really gonna miss him when he leaves. :( Cassie came up and hugged me and wouldnt let go...she really loves me...she had to sit between "Aunt Donna and Terri" So yeah...she did pretty good until the end...when she got the giggles...then we ate the best chocolate browies...to die for! Very good. Then Mom and I cleaned the library...woo...*rolls eyes* This months pay check isnt gonna be to good...only 29 this month...dang. So after that came home and headed over to Spencer to see my Grandpa some more. Im getting to know that hospital pretty dang well. So we stayed there for awhile...Cody was there and we were giving him crap. Supposedly yesterday he wore sandles all day and got really funny burn lines on his feet...I just laughed...hes so stupid but ya gotta love him...Hes like the closest cousin to me...well...thats around here..so yeah..we have fun. I give him crap all the time...like we were talkin bout sevies...n stuff. Then he was squeaking the chair and pretending he was farting...*shakes head* Yeah. Then we went to Walmart and we got all the paint mixed that we need for my bedroom. Im so excited! I'll be so bright...I wont get depressed anymore! It'll be so much fun to paint...Tho I have to get my room all cleaned up before we can paint...so I have alot of work to do this week...cuz we start painting a week from tomorrow. So we came home and I just laid around for awhile...bored as ever. Started to clean a lil more in my room...Counted all of my flip flops...24 I tell you 24! Thats not counting Ross's or my dressier ones. I have 20 just laying there in the kitchen, no wonder my mom was getting annoyed saying there was to many. LoL And these are only flip flops...Im not even gonna start counting the regular shoes....the church shoes...all that stuff...It'd never end! Yeah. I was also happy cuz I figured out Ross's shoe size from his sandles...since he wouldnt tell me last night...hehehe. ;) Yeah...So we grilled for supper and then I went to the church and practiced the organ for a whole 45 minutes. Thats the longest I've practiced in a long time. My mom was amazed. So was I. Then came home and sorted some more stuff in my room. I can't even walk in there...I have about 5 boxes just layin there full of crap in the middle of my room...You have to jump to get anywhere...to get to my clothes. Yeah. Pretty sad...But soon it'll be all pretty and I'll be happy. Since this is my b-day present I probably wont get a dang thing on my b-day. Oh well...*shrug*...Well Im outta things to ramble bout...so I'll head out for now....

      Hmm...I think somethings gonna happen...to me. I keep getting all these signs...and its kinda creeping me out. All over the place its saying something like do it now or you wont have the chance later...A TV show said that...a book im reading...the movie tonight. Its kinda getting to me...trying to tell me something I think. Like...do it now or you'll never get to. Makes me think bout how...you never know if you'll live tomorrow. What if I died in my sleep tonight. Would I ever get to say what I feel. Don't know why but tears just filled my eyes. What is wrong with me? Im like shaking...*sigh* My Grandpa almost lost his life last night. I guess it just hit me that he could not be with us know. I thank God he is. *sigh* Everything is getting to me. What if I don't get to do what I want...What if I don't ever see Ross again. What if I could never tell him that I loved him as much as I do. What if...*Sigh* Im almost scared that God is trying to tell me that I don't have much time left. All these signs in one day....its scaring me. *sigh* I dunno. My heart is beating so fast right now. *sigh* Well I want you all to know...how much I care...even if I supposedly "hate" you...its not like I don't care. I do. I really do. *Sigh* I want you all to know I love you. Just in case something ever happens to me. Even if it doesn't seem like it...I do. I just want you all to know this..just incase something bad would happen. You never know how much time you have left. I just hope I have alot left. I have so much to look forward to. *sigh* I really am going crazy...I should just shut up....Im gonna go now....leave you with this...Even if I dont seem like I care...I do...I love you all...and I love you Ross.

      Boring Saturday...slept in late...tanned for 2 hours and now here I am...with not really anything to talk about. I guess since its been a pretty laid back day I had time to think bout some stuff...I was thinkin bout oh this summer n NYE n all that stuff..and it got me thinkin. Well I really don't know how to say it all but w/e...I just feel like...our circle of friends or w/e from Synod would probably all be better without me. I feel like Im the one left out. Im just the outcast..the one whos just...there. No purpose just there. I feel like that now. Dont know why...just feels like everyones lives would have been better if I wouldnt have gone to Synod. Tho I still would have gotten to know some of them...Before Synod I had already joined YC so yeah. Dunno. Just kinda feeling left out. Tho I guess thats not new at all...Im left out here....So I guess theres no problem right? Yeah...I dunno...I dont even know why I even wrote all this....w/e...*shrug* Well im about to go to a movie...so im gonna go...

      Woohoo post number 50!....:S  Well today...Sucked.  I woke up and it was raining..I was sooo pissed. I wanted to go to Ross's game and my mom was actually looking forward to it to...but it was cancelled. :( *Sigh* Guess he has to wait longer for his b-day present. So now I probably wont get to see him play at all...that really makes me mad...Cuz Algona was the closest to us...even tho that was an hour and a half away...we were gonna go...but I guess thats how it goes.....  So Mom and I went over to Spencer to visit Grandpa and see how he was doing. He was sitting up and was started on clear liquids...so hes doin good. Hes not in any pain and hes not sick to his stomach so its all good. When he took a nap Mom and I took Grandma out for lunch so we went to the mall and I got a blizard. Even tho it was only like 69 today it still tasted great. I didn't attempt to throw this one at anyone...lol. Last one I had I kinda attempted to throw at Kait...but it just tipped over. LoL. So yeah...then we went back and stayed with Grandpa till about 5 and came home...and I really haven't done anything else. Our internet got fixed. A guy came and gave us a free upgrade and new modem so it works great now. Tho I think we might have a virus and thats slowin the whole comp down...But W/E. So all I did tonight was clean my room and get stuff in boxes...I took all my pictures off my wall :( Im sure gonna miss that. But it'll be nice to have my room painted all fun n stuff. We picked out the colors today and we're gonna go get them tomorrow. Yeah Im gonna count all the pictures that I had up there...I betcha I had atleast 200...But I'll count them later...I also went thru some old toys...brought back some good memories...there was some stuff that brought back bad memories too....those all went in the trash tho. So I guess not much else has gone on....  Tara    Current Music:  none  Current Mood:  tired  Quote of the Day:  "You taught me that socks don't need to be ironed." -How To Deal

      Well im finally home from the hospital. No nothing happened to me...but my Grandpa Frick had his kidney taken out today. I was there from 8 this morning till a little after 6 tonight. Everything went great...Hes in good shape. So thats good. Only the kidney was contained and its gone and he bled very little so everythings lookin up. We had a family reunion in there I swear! We had Grandma, Phyllis, Donnie, Leslie, Merna Rae, and my mom and I. Howard and Jean also showed up. So yeah. After we heard the good news we all went out shopping for a lil while and got lunch and brought it all back. I had a good time with Aunt Merna Rae since I never really spend much time with her...and we both have the shoe love. My mom was lookin all over for us and once we showed up we told her we were in the shoes and my mom just laughed and said that she should of known that. LoL. Yeah. So I've been kinda ticked all last night and today because stupid TCA hasn't been working. Atleast the people who use the server. So right now I'm at my Grandma Hansens. She has TCA but she has dial-up...so it must be different cuz this is working just fine. I was goin crazy at home...I was soo bored. Oh...also today after we left the hospital I went shopping for just a lil while and I got new shorts and a skirt. Heh my moms gonna hate it..."Its to short!" Oh well...Dont care...We're actually getting along in my house for once...amazing. Theres actually been more laughs than yells...We haven't yelled for atleast 3 days! Thats like a record or something...so yeah. Right now all im doing is hoping it doesnt rain tomorrow...Im soooo sick of rain! Its raining right now...eh. I need my sun back! *sigh* Oh well it gave my burn time to heal and turn into tan...I didn't peel so my back looks dark now...so its all good. Im almost darker than my Aunt Leslie who is from the Phillepines (sp?) Eh cant spell..oh well. So yeah...Guess not much else is happening round here...pretty dang boring....

      The endless hours of Barney has ended! *sigh* I babysat my cousin Cassie today from 8:45-5:30...It was alot of fun and kept me busy for once. I get to do the same on saturday. So I got there and we played Pretty Pretty Princess and Littlest Petshop. Then her friend Kaitlyn came over and they played for awhile until storms came and Kait went home. Since Cassie hates thunder we went downstairs and watched tv and played some more games. We also watched an hour of Barney. Joy. Then I went upstairs and made lunch...she ate so much! She nevers eats so good. She had 2 hotdogs, a bunch of corn, and a full glass of milk. I was soo proud. I think she had more than me! Then we played pollys and barbies...Around 2 or so we went to the church and colored postcards for sick people that are in the hospital. I thought it was a cute idea. Then we ran home and sat around some more and then she ended up reading me some stories. Yeah...Im wore out now...but it was fun. Shes such a cutie. Love her to death!   Oh and last night I was amused and added a bunch of stuff on here...like a hug counter...and I don't have any yet. :( Not loved. Darn LoL. Im just in a good mood.  AND...I cant wait till September! Mom and I are going to see CLAY AIKEN! :D Im soo excited! It'll be so fun! I just hope we dont have YC that weekend...But no matter what Im goin to see Clay. Yeah...its all good....today was a good day.  Tara   Current Music:  none  Current Mood:  Happy  Quote of the Day:  "Do you know how to play barbies Terri?" -Cassie

Anyways...Today has been pretty boring...woke up and went to organ lessons...*yawn* And then I've been sitting around the rest of the time....I made banana bread to prove I can bake something since nobody round here thinks I can. *shrug* So yeah....Im bored since Kims on vacation..pretty sad that shes the only one around that I can do something with. Tracy lives in Sanborn...and since we cant drive...yeah...And I really can't think of anyone else who I could do stuff with so I'll sit here being the loner like I am. So yeah...I really am bored and I have nothing left to ramble about so I'll let you all get back to your lives...Tho Im really startin to think no one reads this anymore...which is fine by me...I guess I'll just keep writing cuz I like to...so yeah...Later.

I got it out just in time to. But I felt so scrodie...I didn't even do a thing with my hair...to lazy I guess. So I came back home changed into my suit and laid out from 1-3:45. I bet I saw 3 clouds thats it. It was soo great! The bugs weren't annoying and there was a breeze to keep me cool. They even played "What A Beautiful Day" on the radio. LoL...Good song actually. So yeah...It was nice...Except now...My back is super burnt in the places I couldn't get sun screen. And just now it started to hurt. Oh well...Im alot tanner everywhere else. I love the sun. Now if only everyday this summer would be this nice. *sigh* Summer is great! :D Well...I guess we're gonna be eatin supper soon....so I better go....

      Well its been awhile because I've been gone so heres an update on it all...Well Thursday night I called Ross and talked to him for 2 hours. Made me happy but I was sad when it ended cuz I missed him soo much. But I lived. Then I went to bed and got up early to leave for Grinnell with Mert and Evie. We drove thru Humboldt around 11:20 that morning and I dont think I ever took a breath...I just held it the whole time. *sigh* So we kept goin along and we stoped at Sonic in Fort Dodge for lunch and then got to Grinnell around 2:30. We got all ready and went to our rooms. I finally got excited then. I got settled in my room then went to Mert and Evies. Then after an hour I decided to go back to see if Kait was there yet and she wasnt so I left her a note and told her to come to Mert n Evies. Around 4:30 she got there and we went off...We found the pop machines and we hung out in a closet. Fun stuff. Then it was supper and then we had church. It was sooo cold in there. I frose. Then we went back to our room. We got thristy so we went back and found Mert and Evie cuz I needed change...and the pop machines wouldnt work. They did earlier but not now...so Mert and Evie were gonna drive us to a gas station but then his van wouldnt work...so we just finally gave up and went and watched TV and ate Mert Mix till 1ish and then we went back to our dorms and sat around. Bout 2:30 we went for a walk. It was soo quite out...it was nice...Then we went to sleep from 4-6. 2 hours. Great stuff. Then we got up n showered and got all my stuff packed into Debs van cuz we planed it all out that I could go stay with Kait and then Mert would pick me up on Sunday afternoon after dropin off Evie at their daughters. So then we had breakfast and then workshops. Thats when she met Noel. I knew him from last year...so we kinda hung out with him for awhile. Then we had another church/meeting goin on and we sat by him during that and he fell asleep. It was pretty funny. Then we had lunch and our second workshop. We went to 2 Mile and planted flowers and sorted thru toys n stuff. It was amusing. I got kinda burnt. So we went back and then we headed off with Deb. We ran into some pretty bad weather...I kinda freaked for awhile there. It stoped once we got to Ft. Dodge. We went to Walmart there and Kait and I bought more shoes. So we got to Humboldt around 6:30ish and went out to eat at Changs. And then after that we went to Ross's house. We got inside and Lexi just jumped all over me and my legs are now all scratced up n stuff. So then we went to Dairy Queen. HE DROVE! lol First time he ever drove me. Woo. And we ate there...I was soo full! Then we cruised around for awhile...and when we got back to his house...he was trying to park in the garage and kinda...hit it. LoL. Yeah....Then we stayed at his house till 11 and he brought us back to Kaits...and he hit the garage again. LoL. *Shakes head* Oh well. Then this morning I got up kinda early cuz my mom called all freaked out she didnt know what happened cuz I didnt call last night. Eh. So we showered n stuff and then went to Church. It was good...Then we went back to Kaits and sat around...had lunch...went to Pamida....had topical sno...and then round 3 or so Ross came over. Yeah...that was....interesting....*sigh* He signed my hand and wrote "Im with stupid" and then atempted to paint my nails...Haha. Fun stuff...so yeah...It was good...If I didn't see him today I know it would of killed me..Just being there all this morning and not hurt me. I felt like I had a huge brick on my heart. Yeah...*sigh* So around 6 Mert showed up and it was time to leave...I actually didnt cry tho...I coulda but I was with Mert so I held it back...Betcha 20 bucks I'll cry before I go to bed...but yeah. So I got my kiss and hug goodbye...and then we hit the road. I kept my eyes shut just so I wouldnt cry. I called my mom at Pocahontas and then I decided I was just gonna rest my eyes...I didnt even know I was gonna sleep...I didnt think I did...I opened my eyes thinking we were in Algona but we were in Everly. Kinda surprised me. I didnt know I was so tired to go out so hard. So yeah I got home bout 8:30 and got yelled at. Just what I needed....then mom made me go clean the library and now im here writing this...*sigh* Im just soo glad I got to see Ross...And I had a good time this weekend...Even tho...some parts werent so hot it was still alright.....

      Well today Ross turns 16. I haven't even talked to him yet...and Im gonna go crazy if I don't. I don't even get to see him on his birthday. *sigh* I really wish I could...But tonight is the last night for Bible School and I really have to be there. Its been 39 days since I've seen him tho. Eh...kills me. On top of it all I've been super emotional last night and all day today...I just cry at random times *sigh* I don't know. Its weird. *sigh* First song I heard today was The Reason. That helps even more. Eh. I hate crying...but it feels good too I guess. Otherwise today has been very uneventful. I woke up late again...sat on the computer for awhile...Kim came over...I packed for this weekend and thats about all. *sigh* I get to see Kait tomorrow...and Im excited but I wish I could see Ross too. Who knows when he'll get his present. Probably July. LoL. Oh well...*sigh* I just miss him...and feel soo young...hes 16 now...and Im sadly still 14. Oh well its not as bad as my parents my Dad is like 5 years older than my Mom...so yeah. Well the Bible School program is tonight...Might be a disastor. These kids have a VERY short attention span....might not work out to well...but yeah. It'll be cute as normal. So yeah....I guess not much more is goin on....I just miss my Ross......

      Well last night at Bible School was good. Had a great time with the other lady helping. We have alot in common. She really...reminds me of Ross's mom. Shes really nice and I had a good time. We had to keep the kids really busy cuz it was kinda gettin bad outside so we just kept playin music and they didn't even realize it so yeah.  Then last night I stayed online till like 1:30 cuz I couldn't sleep and had nothing better to do. But our stupid mouse doesn't work to well so it got annoying. For 2 whole hours I was on one website. It was a Humboldt website...yeah...thats what you call boredum. lol. Then today I didn't wake up till bout 1...sad huh? Yeah so I jumped in the shower then Kim came over. We hung out for awhile then we went to her house and watched How To Deal for about the 100th time. We can quote almost the whole thing. Sad. LoL. Then came home and went to Bible School. Man was it fun tonight! Well I went early cuz the helpers were all supposed to sing but then they weren't so then I went to my room and started working and then later I found out they did practice and it is tomorrow night so I dunno if I will or not. I might. So then it was opening...I wasn't in a good mood then. Im very emotional right now. Tears keep comin but all the lil kids cheered me up. We went back to our room it was kinda boring at first I worked on a sample and then they had snack. Then we went to a different room to check it out and all the girls just HAD to hold my hand. So they were pulling up n down and all that...I felt like I was being ripped apart. Then Deb tickled Cassie...Then the whole class had to tickle me. Man. That was bad. But they really cheered me up. Then on the way back to class I had 2 kids holdin onto my right hand and 6 on my left. It was hard...some were slow...some were running. Eh. Wore me out. LoL. Then we went to music...so cute...4-6 year olds are just adorable! Yeah. Then we went to another room and Cassie was gettin pretty tired to I had to carry her around. Then back in the room they colored and I talked to Deb for a long time bout NYE and how we are gonna get a bunch of Rally pics together and put them up in church. Then she told everyone she had the cutest pic of Ross and I. *Shakes head* And she said she was gonna give plenty of copies to my mom...great. LoL Then all the lil kids played games. The yelling was really loud. It reminds me of the days when I used to do that. LoL. Then they went home and Cassie was so tired I carried her into her moms room and she just layed on me and tried to sleep. Poor thing. Then they brought me home and here I am now...Well Im gonna go...  Tara   Current Music:  I Just Died In Your Arms Tonight  Current Mood:  Happy and Tired...

Wow I can see again! lol Then we went to pamada and bought my TV for the back room. I was happy. Then we came home and Denny came over and brought our computer back and worked on it for a few hours. It still doesn't work right. Msn wont work and I can't find my folder...but its there somewhere. We just gotta look. But the computer works like new now so im happy. Then around 2 we went to a 50th anniversary party for someone whos...kinda related...Im not sure how but they are. It was alright...Talked to Howard (my pastor) there about how he has only 5 Sundays left until hes gone :( Im gonna cry...But he already said we'd keep in touch and that he is already reserving a invitation to my graduation. LoL. Yeah then mom and I went and cleaned the library. And then we went to Germantown for supper cuz it was my Grandma Hansens B-day. And if you thought Hartley was tiny..this place had like a church, a resturant and one other business and thats all. Maybe..15 houses. Yeah super tiny. This time if you realy did blink you'd miss it. But yeah. Then yesterday I took Kim with us to Sioux Falls. We only got 4 hours to shop tho...because I had to be back for Bible School but it was alright....2 hours in I was already broke. LoL. But I got Ross his b-day present...thats one big brick lifted from my chest...So yeah...I also got a new fun skirt and some other random things...Yeah then Bible School was just grand. I helped with Pre-K. Fun stuff. I love little kids! Theres only bout 17 but 5 more are supposed to be there tonight...so who knows...LoL. We have plenty of helpers so it'll be fine. But last night was just kinda bad...cuz I got a really bad headache and I had to still help with a whole bunch of little loud kids...but I lived. Cassie ended up getting a headache to. I think it was just way to hot in that church. They really should of had the air on. But yeah. So yeah...I dunno what Im gonna do today. Its kinda to windy to tan...but I might try anyway. But I finally got to sleep in! It was 11 when I rolled outta bed. I was happy. LoL Pretty soon I'll be back to normal and it'll be 1 when I do. LoL Yeah...Well I have nothing else to ramble bout...

      Finally, the last day of school! I actually passed! LoL Can you believe it? Yeah today was pretty stupid...cuz we had like 20 minute classes...pretty pointless...all we did was sign out n turn books in and crap like that. It was just...grand. We finished Finding Nemo in Spanish...Science we started bubbles filled with methane on fire. Omg it was soo awesome! It was like on the celing but not starting it on fire. Some pretty fun stuff. Very cool. Fire is awesome. Then Algebra...dumb...Im so glad thats over. I will not miss it. Then we had 45 minutes of homeroom cuz we had to clean lockers n stuff. Then we could leave. Mr. DeGroot was being stupid and we had to do dumb stuff...but oh well...We lived. Then Tracy n Jimmy gave me a ride home and I was feeling pretty good...Until I found out I didnt have a computer. Oh I was mad. All it would do was boot up in safe mode. What a piece! Gur. So then I went to the park to Mayu's going away party. It was really alot of fun. Ashley, Becky, Marie, Amber, Amber, Kali, Lexie, Mayu and I were there. Small croud but alot of fun. We had water ballon fights...we all ended up getting soaked....Beckys step dad jesse got all of us...Eh. But yeah. I got this really cool fan from her. Its all fun. Im really gonna miss Mayu. She was a great friend. Love her to death. So the ending was sad...I got tons and tons of hugs from her. *sigh* She was crying...I held it back for awhile. It was sad. So yeah. Then I came home and taned for awhile. I have a tan line! Woo! :D Hopefully I'll get some more sun soon. I love sun. So yeah. Right now Im at my Grandmas using her computer while shes out to eat with friends. Thank God I could get to a computer. I was going nutts at home. I felt so lost lol. Sad huh? LoL. So I guess thats all for now....  Tara   Current Music:  Naughty Girl by Beyonce  Current Mood:  Happy  Quote of the Day:  "Im gonna miss you soo much Tara!!" - Mayu

      I'm a whole lot better now. Kait called and I was like "Woah...she never calls me.." So I had a nice chat with her and she made me laugh and I felt a ton better. So yeah..I'll run through my day now...In Spanish today I was supposed to take a quiz cuz I was sick when everyone else took it...but she lost it so she said forget it. Yay! lol Then we watched Finding Nemo...oh for fun~! Yeah. And we had tons of food. Paige brought her brownies...Jenny brought breakfast pizza...Jenna brought bagels and this yummy cream. It was just so fattening! Very yummy tho. So yeah. Science was just dumb...Took our tests...I probably failed but I don't really care anymore. So yeah. Nothin really happened at lunch or in homeroom..Algebra probably failed that test too. It was alright until the last page graphing all the crap. I always get confused on that part so yeah. Then in choir Tracy painted my nails and now they are all pretty...I have flowers on my thumbs..then these fun lines and dots then cherries and on my ring finger I have yellow and blue stripes(afterwards I realized that that is Humboldt colors lol) and then I have hearts on my pinkys. Fun stuff. Yeah. Band was boring...we just sat around gettin stuff ready for marching band. Ugh. What a drag. I really hope we dont have YC on the 2 or the 9th of October...Or I'll be pissed once again. So yeah...Then we had a cheerleading meeting...*sigh* We do have a JV squad now...*sigh* Tho I guess I'll be Varsity the next two years...If I stick to it. I dunno. *shrug* Depends on what happens...Yeah. So yeah...I guess thats all that happened today........  Tara   Current Song:  none.  Current Mood:  content.

      I really need to write...None of this will be very interesting so you can tune out now if you'd like. I just need to write my feelings at the moment. I need to let them out before I do explode. *sigh* Alright. First off...I guess I really don't understand guys...I just don't get it...why. *sigh* Whatever. Screw it. Family life sucks even more. Endless fights....*sigh* I want to get away. Im really thinkin bout just walking out and just keep walking...give myself time to feel relived n stuff. Im in so much pain it kills me. My life is just filled with tons of disapointment. *sigh* I have a very strong feeling that Ross is mad at me too. *sigh* I dunno... Just a lil over an hour ago I was laughing and having fun...now im sitting here crying..again. God. I don't know....Ross is probably mad cuz I vented alot on him...but I needed to get it out...Parents...God knows...various reasons. They just hate me. *sigh* Whatever. Im out.

      Well I didn't get to write yesterday cuz my 1st cousin once removed in law (lol) was here last night trying to fix our computer. Which its still being gay but yeah he got a ton of junk of our comp. But yeah...yesterday...*sigh* Well it started off really bad...I realized I forgot to wear my watch and bracelet. I about died. First time I ever forgot to wear the bracelet. Made me sad. But yeah. Then I had to take my oral test in Spanish and I got an A! a 99.5 percent. Woo. I was super happy about that. In the middle of spanish Tori came! I hadn't seen her since Christmas. But she kinda ignored me for awhile but later we got to talk. So science was gay...so was Algebra. Eh. Then in choir Tracy and I sat there again doing nothing. Fun stuff. Then in band Tori came and sat by me and we talked a lil bit. Then I came home and Kim came over for awhile and then Greg came and stayed 8 hours. I was sooo bored. I didn't have the computer. *sigh* Plus my wisdom teeth are coming in and that gives me killer headaches and I swear my mouth is like swollen. Gur. It sucks. But yeah. Then today not much happened in the morning. Tracy and I went to a choir lesson for our exit test. Holy crap, I didn't know I could sing so high. It was scary. Mrs. Ewen was happy tho. LoL. So then stupid spanish...was boring since ppl were still testing. But we're gonna have a party tomorrow. I have to bring Finding Nemo so we can watch that. Then Science and Algebra was all reveiw today cuz we had big tests tomorrow :$ Eh. I don't care if I fail or pass the algebra test. He said it would only affect our grade my 3 percents. So I'm still gonna stay the same. So yeah. Im not really gonna worry bout it. Then today in Choir and Band I took Tracys phone and she told me to text Jimmy so I did. It was odd. LOL but hes just kinda dumb. LoL then I had to bring my trombone home so Jimmy n Tracy gave me a ride...so yeah...Thats all that been goin on.. Ive gotta go to Sheldon now.

      Wow. &nbsp; Life....its just...Wow. &nbsp; I never saw this coming...Everyone told me we were perfect...we would be together forever...and have 20 kids...well maybe not 20...that'd kinda suck...but anyways. They always said we'd always be.  &nbsp; God why'd it have to end? WHY? This past year was the best year of my life. There were ups n downs...but I never saw it coming to this. Never.  &nbsp; I cry as I write this....My life ended tonight. I still may be living....but inside I am dead. I am lost. I've lost everything...How am I supposed to go on? God, why did I lose the love of my life?  &nbsp; I guess Tara just isnt meant to be happy...I guess God is just punishing me for something. I don't know what. But something. All I need now is a hug...but nothing will be the same. My life is gone. I lost it tonight. Don't know what to do now.&nbsp; Heh. This will probably be the last time I write before I leave for Tennessee. That'll be interesting. I guess im gonna have to end up getting a new blog too. Everytime I see the name Im gonna bust out in tears. I don't know what to do. Im gonna go crazy. Cassie...who is always happy and Im gonna have to take her swimming tomorrow. God...How can I face daylight? I should repaint my room now. Black. Everything. I need darkness. I hurt so God Damn Bad! Heh. I know his reasonings...but heh I just wish there was a way other than this. Maybe takin it slower? I dunno. I just wish it didnt have to come to this. But it did. My life is over. &nbsp; Now my moms so worried about me...shes making me go on a walk with her. She wants to talk but thats the last thing I wanna do right now...but I guess...I will. I guess she and my dad are all I've got now... &nbsp; Tara

      Wow. I feel so great! Im just sitting here laughing my ass off at random things...bout what some random people are telling me. Like Derk said my msn names are always gay...I said thanks and laughed cuz I've learned to let small things like that go by. It just cracks me up. Go on everyone. Yell at me. I'll just laugh at you. Anyways today has been good. Everythings doing great. Im happy and I feel wonderful. I tanned almost all afternoon...the sun feels wonderful. I love it. Its really great. Im really getting nice and dark. Maybe Kim and I will do something tonight cuz I wont get to do much with her tomorrow and I leave Sunday so yeah. Anyways....nothing else is really new. I probably will babysit tomorrow for my sweetie pie and then I'll make 8 bucks and clean the library and then probably finish packing. Im getting more and more excited by the minute! Im just not gonna let anything get to me and next week will go by smoothly. Can't wait! Anyways I'll shall part now.

      Err...I have lots of anger right now.&nbsp; I guess I do know people read this now and I almost wish they didn't cuz this is where I let my feelings out and stuff might come out different than I mean it. So don't go off thinking something cuz it might not be right. Okay to set one thing straight...Im not fucking depressed all the fucking time. Okay I DO have a life. Its just now in the summer I want to be lazy so I don't do anything....so don't freak out on me. Gosh. Maybe&nbsp; I don't wanna go out and do something. Maybe I'd rather say here and tan and be lazy.&nbsp; Hmm...what else. I hate when people judge you by just the few things you write...maybe I had a bad day. Maybe you just miss all the good days. Trust me I'll have plenty of good times to write when I get home...so on the 27th there will be something good. Plus then the 28th is my b-day so I wont be depressed. So people would ya just leave me alone. I know how to live my life. Its just that sometimes you get down and if your a woman you'd understand that. You get emotional alot. My mom and I both...so I got it from&nbsp; her. So gimme a break. Err. Some people get on my nerves. And yeah so what if I dont have a best friend from here. I have friends...just not a best one. Heh. I live my life at school just goin thru the day hoping to see all my friends from YC soon. Thats my life. If you don't like it...don't read this. Okay? Heh. Sorry I had tons of anger built up inside...and im not emotional anymore. Getting out and walking and driving tonight took some emotion off me. All the sudden tonight Im super excited bout this weekend and all next week. I can't wait. It musta been cuz Nancy called and talked to my mom bout it all and it musta just kicked in. Granted im gonna be super sad when Howard leaves...I got some of those tears out tonight...but theres no way theres not gonna be any. Anyways....sorry bout this entry...just had to set somethings right. Since some people don't even know the real me....does anyone?...Maybe like 2 - 3 people do. *shrug* anyways...im in a good-ish mood now that I got all this off my chest...I'll write later.... &nbsp; Tara &nbsp;  Current Music:&nbsp;  none  Current Mood: &nbsp; releaved  Quote of the Day:  todays other entry....

       Eh. The tears continue to fall. I wish I knew why. Then I try to talk bout it to someone and they just practically bite my head off...*sigh* I wish I was leaving tomorrow...Maybe everything would be better. But I have a few days to wait. Tomorrows gonna suck. I wont do anything all day and I'll probably end up like I did today...crappy. Saturday Im gonna babysit my sweetie Cassie. Then Sunday...which will be hell...is gonna be full and I leave at 2.&nbsp; Im gonna let all my tears out Sunday...tho I wont want to...I'll be infront of 100 people but oh well...I betcha most of them will be crying too. I wont be the only one. But *sigh* its really gonna be hard...Howard was the best. He helped me thru alot of things. Im really gonna miss him. But I guess Im also looking forward to Jeff coming. He'll be good.&nbsp; So yeah. Anyways I just have to keep busy and I'll make it thru the next few days. I think Howard leaving might be why Im so down n stuff. Dunno. Anyways all I know is that im really excited bout next week...just hope I don't get to emotional. Or lose it. I think another thing thats gettin to me is...oh nevermind. If I bring it up might cause problems so forget all that.     &nbsp;   Onto other matters...I just got the Sunday School Music for next year. I have to sort thru some of it and see what songs we can do. Im excited about that. *Puts new cd in now* This will be fun. Im exctied. I get to do it all by myself and I love little kids so it'll be fun. If we get it all worked out I might have Tara hold the music...I could play piano and Jeff might play his guitar or something. It'll be interesting. But this is all about new beginnings so if some people don't like the music and want the old stuff...to bad. Im in charge now. :-D And I love little kids!     &nbsp;   Anyways I did practically nothing all day. I packed some and watched a movie. Im just to damn lazy. Yeah. Well I have no more to say...so later all.     &nbsp;   Tara     &nbsp;    Current Music:  Sunday School Music...     Current Mood: &nbsp; Confused, Excited, just plain Moody!

      Well last night...ended up...bad. Stupid computer which I hate very much shut down on me before Ross got off...so I really couldn't say goodbye. I know this probably seems dumb but little things like that mean alot to me...therefore I was sad...very. Yeah. Anyways I found the UCC Iowa link last night and saw that im in a picture on it...Madrid YC Meeting...That sure brings back memories...GOOD ones....I also found Ross's churches website and that gave me a laugh too...Anyways...today was okay. Mom woke me up kinda early and told me my Grandma Hansen was taking me birthday shopping today. So 'round 11 she came and we went over to Spencer. I got some really cute jeans with this really fun belt and two white tank tops...and a grey and white t-shirt. Then came home and went back over to Spencer about 5 with Kim. We had our girls night out again. It was fun. I got new sunglasses so I can take those to Tennessee with me. I started packing today and getting everything into piles. Fun stuff...Im getting more excited by the minute. Anyways Kim and I went to Anchorman and it was pretty good. Quite a few good laughs...Glad we didnt go to the Notebook...I didnt wanna cry. Ive done to much of that lately and I really dont know why...*shrug* Anyways Im looking forward to Monday more and more....Eh. Anyways...Thats all thats been going on....not to much...I was supposed to babysit tomorrow...but my uncle kinda doesnt have a job anymore...so I won't -get- to. Damn I needed that cash. I spent to much today...err...Oh well. Later all....   Tara    Current Music:  You're Still The One by Shania Twain  Current Mood:  Meh...

      Hmm...Yeah. One year today. Earlier I couldn't stop smiling...now Im in tears...Im way to emotional. God. Im happy but why am I crying? I wish I knew. Next time I open my mouth to say something I'll crack. Nevermind...just did. Maybe its this song. I like this song...I think its my new favorite but it makes me cry at times. I don't know. Maybe because...*shrug* Everythings really weird. The more I talk to some people bout some stuff the more they tell me its probably true. The way everything fits...Im thinkin its true too....Im not gonna say any names or anything cuz I know some people do read this but yeah. It really pisses me off...*sigh* I guess its just another opstical...But yeah. Todays the day my wish I made on that star came true one year ago. I thank God everynight for him. I love him sooo much...more than anyone knows...hes my world. Id be lost without him. And I'll never stop loving him...ever. I love you Ross Charles Murtle...with all of my heart. Theres nothing I love more. I cry now...because I love you sooo much. You are my life.   Now heres a song a country one...yeah yeah I know...you all hate country but I don't...this song always just reminds me of some stuff...cuz it says "they said I bet they'd never make it" and last year before we left synod someone said that these church long distance relationships don't last very long...well if you consider a year short...I guess that still applies...but I don't...anyhow here it is. Listen to it sometime. It makes me cry...like any other good song...  When I first saw you, I saw love. And the first time you touched me, I felt love. And after all this time, you're still the one I love.  Looks like we made it Look how far we've come my baby We mighta took the long way We knew we'd get there someday  They said, "I bet they'll never make it" But just look at us holing on We're still together still going strong   (You're still the one) You're still the one I run to The one that I belong to You're still the one I want for life (You're still the one) You're still the one that I love The only one I dream of You're still the one I kiss good night  Ain't nothin' better We beat the odds together I'm glad we didn't listen Look at what we would be missin'   They said, "I bet they'll never make it" But just look at us holing on We're still together still going strong   (You're still the one) You're still the one I run to The one that I belong to You're still the one I want for life (You're still the one) You're still the one that I love The only one I dream of You're still the one I kiss good night  (You're still the one) You're still the one I run to The one that I belong to You're still the one I want for life (You're still the one) You're still the one that I love The only one I dream of You're still the one I kiss good night  I'm so glad we made it Look how far we've come my baby     Tara    Current Music:  Promise Ring  Current Mood:  In Love  Quote of the Day:  I love you Ross...Happy Anniversary!

      So...my weekend of fun is over now...and Im in a depressed mood all the sudden. *sigh* But I guess only 7 days till I see Ross...*sigh* Anyways heres what Kait and I did the rest of the weekend....  Saturday once we got all done showering...by then it was like 2...we went to church and met Jeff and his family. We named Jon his son the Mobb Father. It was funny. I think we scared him tho...but I guess thats what we do best. Then we started figuring out our whole ground and saying what everyone was...like Ross is the oldest...im the youngest...Kaits the tallest...Jon has the longest hair...lol Yeah it was pretty funny. Then we did like nothing all night...and went to bed early since we were so tired...  And today we went to church and layed around all day...We went to Walmart and got shirts that we're gonna write on next week when I come down...we're gonna have fun with them. So yeah....I had fun. I got the How To Deal soundtrack at Walmart and Im listening to it now...I have two favorite songs...I'll probably end up puttin the lyrics to both for the quote cuz im to lazy...So yeah...

Love is more than, more than it seems So, I wear your promise ring  Love labors through the night It breathes and never fights And like a sheet, it lifts before it dies  So don't forget, just like cash, I walk the line Like a soilder guarding what is mine  Hello you, hello me, hello, hello Can't you see? Love is more than, more than it seems So, I wear your promise ring  Wear your promise ring  Wear your promise ring I wear your promise ring

Yeah...*Sigh* Well Kait and I finally got up and moving..we've been awake for like 3 hours but we just laid there and talked...bout what shes gettin me for my birthday and random stuff. Amusing. So yeah we didnt go to bed till lik 6 so we got I think 4 hours of sleep. Yeah. Great stuff...So yesterday was boring until we picked her up. We ate and talked...talked all the way home watched a few movies and talked all night. Yeah it was great fun. So yeah....its probably my turn for the shower now so I'll just head now....

      Well today was just great...if you like having cramps, headaches, droping things, hurting, crying...all that. Yeah. *Sigh* Could today get any worse? I highly doubt it. This morning was alright...until I got cramps...then I got the dropsies...spilled ketchup all over my moms shirt...hurt my knee on a walk...hurt inside seeing my Grandpa not being normal...hurt inside again when I knew something wasnt gonna happen right, which lead to crying and yeah. God this sucks. I hope tomorrows better. I almost doubt it. *sigh* Eh. I've got my period, cramps, bitchiness and all I wanna do is see Ross. Heh. Sorry all who reads this...if anyone does. Im lettin it out...*sigh* I guess I shouldn't be complaining all this but I can't really complain to anyone else cuz they'd just get pissed or something...So I'll continue to bitch here. I guess its one place I can let it all out. *sigh* I guess Im just not in the mood for anything right now except a nice SAD movie...a bowl of cookies n cream icecream and....a box of kleenexs...sounds good to me...I guess. *sigh* Maybe I'll put backdraft in now and watch it...I haven't seen it since November...when Ross was here..so yeah. Whatever. Later kids.  Tara   Current Music:  none  Current Mood:  I think you already know this one.

      Me again. Great huh? Well currently only thing on my mind is excitement. Im not worried or sad bout my Grandpa right now. He went to the docotors today and its like some after surgery depression thingy and my Pastor thinks he might of had a small stroke. Who knows tho. Im just prayin he gets all better...and soon. We all miss the old him. Hes just not the same. Anywho on to my excitement factor. We figured it all out so Kait could come stay this weekend...We're gonna pick her up at 6 on the corner or 71 and 3. Then she'll probably stay till Sunday night or so. I can't wait! It'll be so much fun. Shes never been to my house before so yeah...Hopefully we'll get to go shopping or something too. And Saturday n Sunday is when Jeff and his family are here to meet everyone and he'll have his trial sermon n stuff. So it'll be interesting. So it should be a great time. That was the only exciting thing today...planin and talkin to Kait. Everything else was just...blah. Kim came over and started to clean out boxes of crap in my room....not much fun. I guess it was alright. Rearanging stuff is kinda fun. Its just that I have so much shit now and I don't know what to do with it...Oh well. Hopefully most of it will be back to normal by the time Kait comes so the couch can fold out for her. It still smell of paint in there and its kinda makin me sick...but oh well...I'll live. Otherwise nothing much went on today...so I'll leave it at that....

      Woah. I dunno how to say how I feel right now. Im hurt, scared....and so on. Im almost thinking I should have not gone camping and had fun cuz I just found out how bad my Grandpa is. What happens if I lose him...Everyones talkin like hes gonna be gone soon. No one knows whats wrong with him. Hes different again and eh. I dunno. To see my mom cry like that make me cry even harder. We can't lose him. If hes not better by NYE I probably wont have the most enjoyalbe time. I'll be worried bout if my Grandpa lives thru the night or not. Hes one family member I've been real close too. I have so much fun with him. He always has me laughing. *Sigh* It hurts. I love him. We can't afford to lose another family member. I dunno if I could take it. My Grandma would probably end up giving up if he was gone. *sigh* Well I can barely see the computer screen the tears are falling so much so Im gonna head...Maybe some sleep will help me. I just hope my Grandpa is alright. Goodnight all.  Tara

      Well yes...I am back. Woo! I'll give ya an update on what all went on while I was gone...it was tons and tons of fun...I love being with Tracy...shes just...so lovable. LoL Well here it goes...  Wednesday: Got up early and packed the rest of my stuff...worked in my room for awhile...Mostly just sat there listening to music cuz I was way to lazy to do anything. About 3:45 Terry came and picked me up. He talked with my mom alot bout figuring out our tickets to Clay Aiken n stuff. Cant wait! It'll be tons  of fun with Sandy and Tracy. So then he took be back to Sanborn. Had an interesting chat with him. He told me bout a guy named Chuck that Tracy works with who blew out his brain while scubadivin once and now hes kinda weird n stuff. Like all he says is "Oookeeey." and "Oookeeey guys." "I got this one guys." Yeah. So out whole thing this weekend was "Oookeeey!" Yeah. Then I sat there for awhile and Tracy and Sandy got home from work and soon after that we headed off. The car ride was long but it was alright...we kept ourselves busy n stuff. We got up to Starbuck about 9 and got settled in and stuff and then we headed off to bed.  Thursday: Tracy and I slept in till about 9 and got going...slowly ofcourse...showering is soo much work! Esspecially there. Gotta get all your crap in those bags and carry em over and use the nasty showers that has crappy pressure...but it worked out fine. Then we headed down to the beach and tanned from bout 1-5. Very nice day. Becky and her friend layed out by us and it was just an overall great day. Tho bout 3 or so Tracy and I went to get some pop to drink and I got these pokie things in my foot so we had to call docotor Sandy over to bring tweezers so I could pull em out. Those things were stuck in there pretty darn good. Then as we were leaving Tracy got one. LoL Just a great day for pokies! Then we went out to eat at A&W. And after that we walked around...all the way down to the beach were we saw Paul and George. Fun stuff. We walked alot tho. Felt halfway thin that night....but not for long...We went to bed 11ish maybe...somethin...  Friday:Got up late and showered and around 2 we went down to the beach. This time we timed ourselves. 15 minutes on each side. I think we only lasted bout 3 rotations or so. But in the middle we went and got somethin to drink and there was two guys workin in the shack. One acted just like Gerry and another one looked just like Ross. It kinda...creeped me out. Yeah I think we nicknamed them too. So we went back and had supper and then went downtown to the parade. We actually got a good amount of candy. Fought off all the lil kids for it. LoL. Then we probably sat around the fire that night...then went to bed.  Saturday: Got up late again...and showered. We walked downtown and ate really good tacos. Weird thing was..I ate left handed. *shrug* Then we walked around and looked at stuff. I almost bought myself this really cute ring but I decided not to. Then we hid in the truck hoping Sandy and Tracys Aunt Pam wouldnt see us but they did. Oh well. We rode back in the pickup like that and then we did appsolutely nothing the rest of the day. So I called Ross later on since Jimmy and Tracy talked atleast once a day and I was going crazy. Tracy and I were both pretty hyper and I had really bad reception so who knows if he heard much. *shrug* Then we had supper and had DQ. OMG the French Vanilla Moolate...the best! Greatest thing. Then Tracy and I went along with Becky and Pat and all them on the lake to watch the fireworks. The lake was sooo full of boats! They put on a really good fireworks show. After that we all sat around the fire and watched the neighbors get drunk. It was interesting cuz there were the Kenny Chesney wanna bes and the Eminem wanna bes. It was just...interesting. One of the "cowboys" came over and started talkin to us cuz we were kinda yellin at them n stuff and Tracy asked if he was an actual cowboy and if he had cows that go moo. It was soo hilarious. Terry kinda yelled at him n stuff. Great intertainment! LoL Yeah then we went off to bed...  Sunday:Got up late...once again...showered then had a big lunch. It was cloudy n cold but warm at times. We were bored and layed around did barely anything. We took Ming (sp?) on a walk. Ming is Pam and Daves dog which is Tracys Aunt and Uncle I belive. Yeah. So that amused us. Then we went tubbin for awhile. Becky drove us. It was fun...untill my asthma acted up and it then sucked. It was horrid. I made them bring me back to the boat..and then Beckys boyfriend rode with Tracy. Then when that was all done we showered and hung around....sat around the campfire for a long time. We took Natalie and Nathan to the park there...where this lil boy was getting yelled at. Then I found out his name was Ross...gave me a lil laugh...Then we went back to the fire and sat around while all the "young-ish" people talked. Terry and Larry got married...they lit their sparklers together and it was a bonding moment. It was funny. Those two are hilarious together. Then they all went to bed and Pat, Tracy, and I sat around the fire until super late talkin bout stupid endless things. I got amused by random fireworks that went off...and they laughed at me. LoL. Yeah then we went to bed.   Today: We got up at a decent time and Sandy made us pancakes. I hadnt had pancakes since November when we had them at the fireman breakfast...when Ross was here. The only time he was here. He needs to come back...wonder if he ever will...Anyways then we showered and packed everything into the pickup. And round 2 we headed back for home. Bout the whole last hour it just down poured. It was pretty bad. We couldnt see the road to well...but we made it alright. Im living proof. So yeah I got home bout 6 and thats bout it. I had a great time with Tracy. Tons and tons of fun...and if anyone is still reading all this I'd be amazed....I wrote alot...Oh well...I'll let ya all go now...
