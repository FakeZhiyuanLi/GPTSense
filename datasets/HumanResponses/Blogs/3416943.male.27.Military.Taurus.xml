      I finally saw Nathan's tattoo tonight. I like it! In fact I am gonna go get exactly like next time I get paid enough. Not really. Now Derek an Colin need to get one. Me and are leading the pack with at least 3. Come Derek and Colin everyone has one. Speaking of Derek, he made me feel like I have lost my touch. Derek is a mild mannered Safeway manager, yet he has found the time to belittle someone enough to make them cry. I am a marine and i ahve made someone feel like shit in almost a year. I must be getting complacent in life. If anyone should be berating people it's me. I have in fact made grown men cry for mear amusemnet. Some people might think that that is something that one should not be proud of. Well sorry, I really don't care( ha ha cazy chip head is on tangent). Well that enough megalomaniacle ravings for one night.

      Yes it has been a while, but. who cares. I have nothing to talk about except I have been on a three day beer binge. Other than that nothing new going on. I will comming up to Oregon in a few months( Sept). If you can clear some time we should all meet at someones house. I will be graduating on Sept. 3rd. So any day around the 10th will be good. I've got sunshine in a bag, I'm useless but not for long,the future is coming.

      Today I had I to go to work at 4:45 am( my regular hours are night classes 5:30 pm to Midnight) so the 1st Sgt (high ranking non officer) could give us a safety brief for the four day weeken dthis weekend. A lot of it was no drinking this no drinking that, but one thing that I just could not fucking handle was when she had a guy that was in the brig foor 8 years on drug charges talk to us about what he had done. Basicly he got trafficing. We had this Capt. ask if he was using and if so how did he make it past the piss test. He said he had been using for 6 months and how he got atound the piss tests was a chemical that he would buy from GNC behind the counter. This is the part that bugs. He was forced to go into detail telling all of theese youmg Marines how to get away with drug use by beating the piss tests. How fucking dense can you be to them not to do it but explain to them how to get away with it. Any ways.

      Well I finally got my orders. I am heading east. The far east. Okinawa Japan. I'm ok with this, except I won't see the US very much over the next three years. The good thing is I will be receiving $892 more a paycheck for cost of living, and beer is really cheap over there. I am buying a Nissan Laurel from a good friend that is already over there., which I will be driving on the other side of the road. That'll be fun the couple of weeks. I'll have a good chance of seeing Austalia while I'm there, as well as Thailand (again), Korea and possibly eastern Russia. I should be comming up to Oregon around the first week of Sept. Nathan, I will try to keep up on posting more and I changed my settings so anyone can comment. Anyways I'll holla at ya'll later. Push the little daisies and make em come up.
