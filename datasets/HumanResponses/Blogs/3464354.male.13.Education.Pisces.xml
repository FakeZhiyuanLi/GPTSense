      SUMMER IS ALMOST HERE... And I can't wait!! No school. Sleeping in. Much more money spending. And just the presence of summer feels great. But then when you get home from that last day of school and you walk in the door you're either like-"Now what?" or "HELL YES!!" haha. But either one you still know what you are going to do with your time. This is my schedual: 10am-Wake up 10:30am-eat breakfast/watch tv 11am-take shower 11:30am-computer 12pm-hang out w/ friends/movies,mall,chillin 2pm-lunch 3pm-chill some more 5pm-dinner 6pm-hang out 8pm-watch tv/movies  12:30am-bed/sleep [sleep overs may vary] I cannot wait for Summer!  *Quote of the Day* "I'm feeling a little bumbarded by your intence energy".

      REALITY SHOWS ARE SO... Stupid now!! I mean in the begining it was just Survivor. That's cool and ok, but then all these low rate, cheep, no buget types come in and it makes everything look kinda stereotipical. I was talking to my friend about it and he was like "Ya but you watch Survivor" and it's like-well I watch that because that is the only good one out there. The original. And he actually watched the stupid WB U.S.A superstar show that was a big hoax ("The most elaborate"-not) and completely stupid!! I also watched American Idol seasons one through about 3/4 of the third. But to me it looks riged and I also stopped watching it because they voted off Amy Adams. And I can't believe Fantasia Borino won! I don't like to look at her because of the pircing she has on the skin at the bottom of her nose. It is so so so annoying to look at. Aren't you as descusted as I am with reality shows!?!?   *Quote of the Day* NO CHIPS!!!-(from the mean fat PTA lady who closed the box of chips on my hand)

      HORRAY FOR ELECTIONS 2004... Bush has done nothing good for the United States. I don't see why he wasn't impeached. The economy sucks now, and look at the gas prices! It's rediculous! What's the deal with the war? Why don't we just get out of there before more stupid stuff happens. I'm talking about the Iraq prison pictures, and Nick Burg. I know a guy who just went to Iraq or wherever so don't tell me we're getting out. But praise the lord for the elections. I'm all for Kerry! I hope most of the U.S. is to. At least Bush will be out of the office. HOPEFULLY! I think the Bush election was riged anyway. I mean, the re-counts. In Florida! Where his brother is govenor!! Doesn't anyone else see something there?? Well all I can say is pray for a better America w/ Kerry.   P.S.- I'm starting a quote of the day type thing for my posts:  *Quote of the Day* Differences make us different-differences make us human.(Me, from an essay I had to write on the book "The Giver".)

      IN THE RECENT NEWS.... There have been protests against homosexual weddings. I for one am NOT a homosexual, but the court should let them because it is nobody's buissness but theirs. They make their own decisions which make them individual, and independant. If they want to do what they do I say let them-after all, whould you want to do what you want? It is a free country and making your own decisions is part of that. That's just my opinion though and yours may differ.
