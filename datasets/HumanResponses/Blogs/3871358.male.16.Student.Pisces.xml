      Greetings Just to let all you happy people out there know that I unfortunatley shall be away for the next week, and will be unalbe to post. I hope none of you take this too badly. So, until we meet again I leave you with a little story...  I was awaiting a train to arrive at Edinburgh Waverly, and during my vigilant watch I grew slightly peckish. Heading for the nearest WH Smith I bought a backet of chocolate raisins, and a newspaper (too read, not too eat). Sitting down at a nearby table, I was shortly joined by another man, middle aged and wearing a posh buissness suit. It was precisley because of this "I'm a respectable accountant." appearance that I was so shocked when he reached over, opened my packet of chocolate raisins, and helped himself to a handfull. I was speechless. I could'nt believe this was happening, the man looked mature and respectable, and here he was stealing my candy! Unfortunatley the Brittish aren't good in these sort of situations, and I was so taken aback I didn't know what to say. Instead I pretended to ingnore him, and reached out and took a few myself. "Ha, that'll show him!" I thought to myself. Nope, after a few moments pause, he reached out and took another handfull. How dare he! Now seriously peturbed, the only thing I could thing of doing was to continue politely ignoring him and hope he whent away. I reached out once more and took another handfull of sweets. Oh dear, the man next to me did exactly the same thing a moments later. Well, we continued like this for several minutes, both acting as if nothing strange was happening. Eventually we got to the bottom of the packet, at which point the man got up and walked away. I couldn't believe it, of all then nerve, and whats worse is he got away with it! Now in a seriously bad mood, I picked up my newspaper and headed of toward my train. And under my newspaper I saw my bag of chocolate raisins. So there you have it, there is another person somewhere in the world who has  exactly  the same story as me, but he hasn't got the punchline.  Thanks for reading Stay Beautiful Davus

      Greetings  Just a quick post here, a picture from our camping trip. There are more for those brave few wishing to enter the more deprived aspects of human nature, and these can be found on the blog of the funky Mr T (see link at side). I would like to point out now that the rather suggestive pose struck by moi in one of Gordon's photos is entirely coincidental, and that I was merely tightening my belt. Honest.     urlLink    Not the eyes, not the eyes...    Thanks for reading                                  Stay Beautiful                                                          Davus

                    Greetings!   Welcome once more to euphoria_is_the_way.blogspot.com, the one place in cyberspace that actually makes sense. Actually, that’s a lie. This place makes sense too:  urlLink http://www.radiohead.com                      As some of you may know I only recently got back from holidaying in my summer resort on Tahiti. At least that was where I was supposed to be. Unfortunately, on the way over our flight hit a spot of bad weather, forcing us to make our landing on some un-inhabited island in the Atlantic. It was with trepidation that we set foot on dry land, fearing as we did that the natives might be hostile. Our fears were soon proven justified, as seven passengers and all of the cabin crew were taken away and sacrificed to the native’s foul god. Wearily we continued in darkness, not daring to light a fire for fear of drawing attention to ourselves. One by one the passengers perished, until only my family and I remained. Desperate with hunger, and delirious with first, we finally spotted what looked like civilization through the trees. A holiday house, with 6 bedrooms with en-suite shower and toilet, 2 living rooms, a kitchen so large you could quite happily loose an entire battalion of geologists in, and our own basketball and tennis court to boot.                   What followed was a delightful holiday in the Republic of Ireland, spoiled only by the fact that I wasn’t exactly dressed for such a temperate climate:    urlLink       Brrrrrr...    I think I shall leave it at that, for fear of this turning into another one of those wretched “what I did on my holiday reports” (urrrggghhh, 4 th  year prelims, the memorys, nooooooo…) Any way, I’ll hopefully get more pictures up as soon as I can figure out, or get Gordon to explain to me, how the hell you post more than one picture in a post. Until then it’s:    “Good bye from him”                  “I said it’s a good bye from him…”                   “I’m all alone.”                   “So very alone.”                   “*Sob*”                             Thanks for reading                                                           Stay Beautiful                                                                                     Davus

      Greetings people    This is a true story, and it irritates me most mightily. Read on, and those of you with a knowledge of politics and a weak constitution could do well to sit down.    " Americans allergic to the subtle Democratic flavor of Heinz ketchup can now plunge their "freedom fries" into a 100-percent guaranteed, patriotic alternative: "W Ketchup." "You don't support Democrats. Why should your ketchup?" says the W Ketchup Internet site wketchup.com, which promises a totally US-made condiment, right down to the bottle. Heinz ketchup is an institution on American dining tables. But the taste has soured a little for Republicans because Heinz empire heiress Teresa Heinz-Kerry is married to John Kerry (news - web sites), the Democrat hoping to unseat George W. Bush -- also known simply as "W" -- on November 2. "G5s (Gulfstream jets) or GIs? A Tough Choice," W. Ketchup tells prospective customers. "Choose Heinz and you're supporting Teresa and her husband's Gulfstream Jet, and liberal causes such as Kerry for President," it warns. Heinz has 57 varieties, but also 57 foreign factories, it claims. "W Ketchup comes in one flavor: American.""   As any of you who know me are sure to testify, this kind of thing irritates me to such a degree rarely seen outside of a mosquito jamboree. Auugghh, I hate with a passion right wing Americans. They should all get the chair in my opinion.   Thanks for reading                                     Stay Beatiful                                                         Davus

         As I pen this, the world around me is totally silent, save for the soft purring of a cat on my lap and the gentle noise of Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb. Puuuurrrrrrr... Hello, hello, hello... The reason for this serenity is because it is currently 3:30 am and the world, at least that part of the world situated closest to this nighttime scribbler, is asleep. Asleep that is, except for the cat, David Gilmour’s guitar, and me.     Greetings O traverser of the information highway. My name is Davey Heitler (any jokes about the name to ouchwhydidyoujuststabmeintheeyewithapen@hotmail.com). You may have heard of me through various medical journals, troubled hearsay, or perhaps even by meeting me as was traditional before the downfall of polite society. I hope you are sitting comfortably, or failing that, at least not too uncomfortably. Welcome to my blog, Euphoria's the way!      ( urlLink   if you happened to just wander on here purely by accident and are desperately searching for a way out). I shall endeavour most mightily to post new and interesting comments as often as possible, but i'm not God, mores the pity, so don't fall into despair if I don't post every day. A little despair is perfectly acceptable; just remember to keep everything in perspective.     Anyway, those who have bothered to read the first paragraph (I know, I know, sometimes your excitement can get the better of you, causing you to involuntarily skip to the net paragraph with an exaggerated literary spasm) may well be wondering what I am doing up at 3:30 in the morning. Those free of a fear for paragraphs begining with 'It' should read on to find out...                   It was a blustery July day when myself and my loyal companions, the illustrious Conor McStay and the indefectible Gordon Strachan (who for some reason has taken to calling himself ‘The Messiah’. Oh, and eating raw fish. This needn’t worry you. It worries us, but it needn’t worry you.) Set out on are arduous quest for redemption, absolution of sin and enlightenment. Yup, you guessed it, we were camping in Tensmuir forest. Those of you with a bit of the lawyer about you will know this is illegal, so I say to you: Out!                   Anyway, as we boldly set forth, strong were our hearts and bright was the sky. The whole village of Tayport came out to bid us farewell, many of the children throwing flowers at our feet. Ahem. Okay, maybe not flowers. Alright, alright, we were given spiteful glances from any of the locals that condescended to look our way, and we were ravished by a horde of bison. I mean neds. I wonder why I just typed Bison. Urkk, the delete key is to far way, to lazy to move, urkk, nope, can’t reach. Oh well.                   After a quick satop of at the local “we help you so you don’t have to or some such shit” Co Op to stack up on supplies, namely lots of comfort food and drink, we set off into the dark heart of the foreboding forest.                   A little aside here. Try shouting out loud the word Magma. Go on, don’t be shy. M-A-G-M-A. There, I can guarantee that’s the best word you’ll shout all day. Now, back to the story.                   Luckily we had scouted for locations the preceding night, so we knew where to set up camp. Which is what we did, with some of the grooviest, funkiest, superlative to the power of thirty two music I’ve heard in a long time. Those of you still in shock from that last sentence could do worse than listening o radio 3 at around 11:00 pm. Trust me, you’ll thank me one day. At least I would if I were you. Then again, if I were you I wouldn’t be wearing these pants (very astute of me), so perhaps its for the best that I’m me and you’re you.                   Cue campfire and campfire talk involving pirates (oo-arr) female posteriors (oo-arr) and illegal substances (oo-arr mister “I have principles T the Messiah”). All was dark and quite, save for the gentle crackoling of dying fire embers. A few stars were winking at us in a rather provocative manner, causing Gordo to get a little excited. Then suddenly we heard it.                   “Rooaarrggrrffnnhhoowwwllggrrffhh.”                   The preceding line of letters completely fails to do justice to the unearthly wail/sneeze that we heard. Conor was up a tree shaking in fright, I was lying there, my heart pounding in my chest like a whippet in a bowler hat. Gordon was still talking wistfully about lady chums, being a little slow on the uptake. Eeek, there it is again!                   Those of you out there thinking what a bunch of girls blouses, quite, you might set Gordon of again. All I can say to you is you’d have had to have been there. Suffice to say I was a little bit on the wrong side of terrified, being all on our lonesome on a beach (we actually set up camp a little out of the forest on a handy beach).                   Anhyhoo, my fear was short-lived as we recalled the numerous seals we had already seen basking on the sand earlier that very evening. It was then, with new found purpose in our steps, that we decided to go down on to the beach and confirm our suspicions.                   Guess what? We were right, it was seals! Lots and lots of seals howling ot the moon like some pack of rather soggy wolves. By happy coincidence a reddish glow was just beginning to appear over the horizon, turning the clouds into wonderful blobs of pink cand floss in the sky. It was quite nice, so we lay on the beach in our sleeping bags as the sun rose.                   Gordon and Conor, being the energetic loonies that they are decided to fly their kites, and being the lazy shite that I am, I watched.                   After that we decided to go on an early morning cycle, which passed without incident, save Conor getting all worked up about “cannibal gremlins and goblins living in the woods who like to feast on yellow helmeted cyclists.” After I explained to him that cannibal meant they ate each other, and that, as he was not to my knowledge either a goblin or a gremlin, he was perfectly safe. These fears laid to rest we headed back to camp.                   And that is about it. We packed up the tent (which we never actually used) and then cycled home, at around 7:00 in the morning. I then spent the rest of the day asleep, but I have it on good authority that both of my accomplices went on to make full use of their day. Un-lazy gits.                   We had a camera with us, so I will post some pictures of strange slug like creatures on the beach, creatures that bear more than a passing resemblance to us in sleeping bags in fact. Until then that’s all from me folks, drive home safely tonight. I don’t want you hitting me.                   Thanks for reading                                  Stay Beautiful                                                            Davus

      Greetings As the summer holidays approach their climactic final days, time finnaly seems to have picked up the pace, like a fat man after an ice cream van slowly pulling away. This last week has literally whizzed past, making that exact noise as it did so. As I'm sure all of you know, this last week is traditionaly a week in which the calendars are full up with variouse social gatherings of one kind or another. I have in fact been to two parties this week, and almost made it to 4, (sorry Ged and Sam...) so my time has been incredibly full up leaving no room for, say, tidying my room, or even preparing my presentation for modern studies due in on Wednesday. Not cool. Party numero uno was a small local get together, consisting of a few friends and myself meeting up at Danny's house (kudos to him), where we all had a great time just chilling out. A Halo tournament was played, loud music was on constantly (no, no, no more Metalica, for the love of anthropomorphic personification of human permenance). Later on we proceeded to one of the many sitting rooms that infest my friends house like some kind of parasitic extension. We then lit a nice log fire, and whittled away the hours, drinking fine wine and port and just generally talking. Okay, it sounds crap, but it was actually realy groovy, despite a few things being mentioned that really shouldn't have been.  And if that doesn't leave you intrigued, all I'll say is eeuuuuggghhhh... We then whent to bed at the healthy time of 5 in the morning. And I got the bed this time, so thanks to Tim Collins for being born, for with out him his parents would never have bought the bed that I slept in, and my night would have been much less restfull! Party numero two was a slightly larger affair. This was a goodbye party to two of my Quaker buddies Hannah Reade and Sam Turner. Both are leaving the country soon, so about 40 of us gathered on the meadows in Edinburgh to wish them farewell. Despite the sweltering heat, a good time was had by all, as we ate, drank and chatted into the evening. What's also cool is that while this was happening we were being filmed as part of a program by BBC Scotland about young people and their faith. Faith isn't something I'm going to go into here, as if I did I'd be here all night, so a post for another day methinks. So, if by any chance you happen to be flicking through the TV channels in the future, and a random group of scary hippies appear, it's probably us. Anyhoo As the sun finally set, those few of us who were staying the night in Edinburgh made their way to their variouse ports of call. Myself and 13 weary companions made our way, by route of variouse pub toilets, to Hannahs house, were the partying continued. To cut a long story short, I had a great time bar one embarrasing incident involving myself and the living room floor. Actually, I feel really shit  and guilty about the whole episode, as it was a really crappy thing to do at someones leaving party. So Hannah, if by any chance you read this, I'm  really  sorry. I know I've said this already, but I still feel bad about the whole thing. Oh, and many thanks for looking after me, it was much appreciated. So, overall a mostly groovy week, and it would seem that party time is over and schools back in. Or is it? I've been thinking a lot the past week (stop press!), and I may have a cunning plan...

      Greetings  Today is the day when every person in scotland who sat an exam in may receives their results.  Early this morning, at the brain shattering time of 8:00, I, like many others across the country, whent to the front door in search of the dreaded package. And I'm sure that across the country many found it, and were subsequently thrilled or devestated by what lay witihin. Not me. It wasn't bloody there. To cut a long story short, around 3 hours later I looked out the window to see a bemused looking postie walking up and down the street. He wandered up our lane, promptly took a wrong turn, and whent into our garden. Oh dear. My dad rushed outside and asked him if he had our results.  "Urr, no, don't think so."  Long pause.  "Whaaaatttt!"  Frightened postie.  "Wait, let me just check my satchel."  A couple of seconds of frantic searching.  "Oh wait, here they are."   Yes, here they were, and boy did it feel good. 3 A's and two B's (the A's in Classics, Modern Studies and English, the B's in Computing and Maths.) A big pat on the back for me!   urlLink    Go Davus, Go Davus!  Thanks for reading Stay Beautiful Davus

      Greetings Ho ho, just posting to say "Look, I'm back!" Actually, I think I left my brain on the train (hey hey, that sorta rhymes...) so I'm not entirely back. Even if I was wholly back, I'm really not in the mood for writing a really long post about what I've been doing. In fact It's entirely possible that I won't post anything for another couple of days, while I catch up with several weeks worth of sleep. So there. *Clunking noise as head hits desk*   urlLink    ZZZZzzzZZZZzzzzz  Thanks for reading Stay Beautiful Davus
