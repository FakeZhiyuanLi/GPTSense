						   Church was great yesterday and the youth group meeting afterwards was too.  In the morning pastor preached on the great commission and the purpose of the church.  He said the purpose of the church was to glorify God and not to make sinners feel comfortable at church.  In other words, church isn't a tool for evangelism.  We shouldn't try to make sinners come to church to get saved in big groups.  Church is a place where we gather and the Holy Spirit is present.  Sinners will never feel comfortable in His presence and we shouldn't try to make them feel so.  Sunday evening was the end of Second Kings.  How Judah was destroyed but God still kept alive a seed of David.  It was also neat to see how God fulfilled His promises.  First that Judah would be taken captive.  Second that Zedekiah (a.k.a Jeconiah and Jehoiachin) would not see Babylon.  Third that Zedekiah would see the king of Babylon and that he would go to Babylon.  It seems like they contradict.  What happened is that Zedekiah saw the king, the king gouged out his eyes, sent him to Babylon, and then imprisoned him there.  Gruesome, yet amazing.  There are so many more promises that were made for Israel if they rebelled.  Those were made in Deuteronomy.  They were also fulfilled.  God is incredible.  I pray that I remember God's promises to me that I may not sin.  Lord, help us all to fear you.

						   I'm going to try to read through the Bible before summer is over.  I think I can do it.  It's cool though b/c I'm reading through it chronologically.  I read the first 11 or so chapters of Genesis and now I'm in Job.  I also want to go witnessing sometime.  I think witnessing is incredibly important.  Pray for me that I can do these things.  See ya.

						   I've had a great day.  I'm dissapointed that we didn't have the Bible study, but that's ok, next week.  I've realized I need to have more of a constant joy.  I need to let it show too.  Pray that I do.  Next week we're doing the Bible study even if there are only two people.  I need to go.  Pray for each other.

						   This morning's sermon was great!  It was John 21:15-25, the passage where Christ has the conversation where he asks Peter if he loves Him and tells him to feed His sheep.  The call of Christ for us to love Him was so clear and that the action of our love should be our total devotion to Him was crystal clear.  It was great.  The Bible study is on for tomorrow, 5:30-7:30.  For those who don't have the book, I have been able to get some.  So don't worry about buying it.  I wrote earlier about praying that I have a desire to have my devotions.  Well, someone prayed b/c last night I read straight through Romans.  I didn't ever want to stop either.  It was exactly what I needed too.  Thank God. I got to go.  PRAY

						   Hey, I pray things are going well for you.  I probably won't be able to come to the Bible study this Monday.  I've altered my work schedule to accomadate later on though.  Pray for me.  I've done some things I shouldn't have and I'm struggling some.  It's so hard to have devotions even though I know I should.  Pray that I'll have a desire.  I need it.  I'm looking forward to the Bible study.  It was depressing at first on Friday when things didn't work out, but Mondays will work now.  Read through first Timothy.  It'll help for the Bible study.  See ya.  PRAY.

						   I read II Timothy this morning.  It's really good (Duh).  It seems that Timothy must have been going through a hard time.  I'm not one of those people who says you need to read between the lines, but Paul says he is mindful of Timothy's tears, and he seems to be giving encouragement.  If anyone was going through a hard time for their faith then I would recommend II Timothy.  I've been trying to read more since I have more free time now.  It really helps on the epistles to read the whole thing at once.  Mr. Huff was right.  It would be cool if instead of doing a chapter study we did a book study.  It would be a lot of work though.  Well, I don't know all the reasons why no one else has posted, but we'll figure things out at the meeting.  See ya.

						   The morning message at church was really good today.  It was John 21:1-14.  The story of the disciples fishing and Christ telling them to cast their net on the other side of the boat.  Pastor spoke about many things.  The title of the sermon was "Renewing the Fisherman's Calling."  It was a good sermon for the start of the summer to make sure that we renew ourselves to doing what God would have us to do.  To make sure that we are witnesses and that we don't fall into our old routine that we had b/4 he called us.  Anyway, just some random thoughts.

						   I looked this morning for a specific book of the Bible to study.  In our meeting it was mentioned that we should study one of the Timothys or Titus.  I looked at 1 Timothy and I think it meets what we wanted.  Right away Paul talks about who he is: chief of sinners.  After we finish this one we can go on to one of the others if we feel that is where we should go.  I hope you guys are checking this blog.  I'm going to try to email less and instead just post on here.  Well see ya.

						   Well, summer is here.  Friends, we are seniors.  Life is great and God is good.  What more have we need of.  One of the things I've dealt with in becoming a senior is that all my friends who were previously seniors are now gone.  I've dreaded my senior year since I was a freshman because I knew that I would lose a lot of friends.  However, God gave me you guys for whom I am very thankful, and Daniel has always been a constant.  Facing summer though is almost more daunting than facing my senior year.  I struggle a lot during the summer.  Without the precautions of school and the Godly influences that are in my life during the school year it becomes very difficult to do what's right and very easy to do what is wrong.  My prayer is that through the Bible study and this website that I will stay accountable to God and do what is right.  I hope that we all have this prayer, that "the mind of Christ our Savior [may] dwell in [us] from day to day.  By it's power and love controlling, all [we] do and say."  In the back of William Borden's Bible were found these three phrases: "No reserves.  No retreats.  No regrets."  During the summer and my life I want to give all the way and go all the way without groaning that I may please God.  By God's grace I think I can.  I pray that we all can.  See you and pray for you.

						   The purpose of this website is to keep us accountable to each other so that ultimately we will be accountable to God.  Anyone can come to it and comment or post if they would like.  However, they're may be differing opinions.  I simply ask us all to remember that we are Christians and should act as such.  I hope and pray that this works well.  Prayer requests can be mentioned on here to, but remember that we do not know who will be reading.  Speaking of prayer requests I have a huge unspoken.  Please pray.  God knows what for.  I will send each of you Administrator access as soon as I can.  Check your email for it.

						   Well,  It's been awhile since I last posted. Life's been busy and God's been good. I'd appreciate your prayers for my brother and sisters. My brother and his wife are both in Peru on a shorterm mission trip. This is Rus's third time there and he's planning to go longterm in time. My sister is preparing to go to Canada on a trip to help out some Christians up there. My other sister's health has been failing for some time and now its only a matter of time. She's got a husband and little girls. But through it all God is good! His mercy endures to all generations, but especcially to this generation! I've been struggling a lot with apathy this summer. The bottom line is, I have to stay in God's Word! Keep praying for each other.

						   I just wanted to share this.  I was getting awfully frustrated about some things along these lines.  I've become so frustrated with the school and people b/c they just don't get it.  They seem to ignore the Bible on some points and to take such weak views.  I hate to call myself strong, but in this case that's how Paul puts it.  Read the passage, think about it, and I'm going to try to practice it.  Daniel I'll talk to you later about our phone conversation.  See you.

						   Elvis has entered the chat-room! I haven't been able to find my password for awhile but thanks to DanMan's urgings that is no longer a problem. Hey Moses, I'd like to see some of those songs you've been writing. It seems like that's all I've been doing this summer is writing song after song. Well, I went to the "Quieting a Noisy Soul" conference hosted by Jim Berg and God really put a mirror in front of my face. Needless to say it wasn't what I wanted to see but exactly what I needed to be shown. Right now, I guess you could say there's been a passage from Jeremiah that's haunting my thoughts. Jeremiah 2:20-21 has been such a harsh-truth reality check. I understand just how much time I've wasted and strain I've hoarded up within being a strange vine to God. I mean this verse is like a biography of my spiritual life. It seems one moment I'm saying, with a desire to do, "I will not transgress" and then as soon as I turn my back on myself I'm off to my favorite tree or hill. I know people say this a lot but, I need a lot of prayer (I know we all do) but I really desire to be a noble vine again but my heart is so unfaithful. I'm almost finished with the book of Mark and that's been a huge blessing. Right now, I guess I'm working on that face in the mirror and with God's help (and a little prayer support) I truly desire to be a wholly noble vine in God's eyes.

						   I hope you can come down Daniel.  I know the frustration but God's will will be done.  So you'll have to accept it either way.  Their is so much joy though in knowing God is sovereign.  I had some incredible joy just well up in me today.  I was listening to a song that talks about delighting in God and I was outside.  I just looked around me at the world and this wonderful satisfaction and happiness filled me as if to say that all I need to delight in is God and His gifts such as nature just point back to Him.  I would not understand glory unless I had seen nature.  Yet nature is just a small reflection of that infinite glory found in God.  God has given me an incredible desire lately for His return so that some times if I sense that a cloud has covered the sun I'll look up hoping to see Christ.  Their is never disappointment though b/c I know that it means there is a purpose for me staying and Him not coming.  I just have more hope that maybe next time He'll be there.  I'm getting closer to the end of  Desiring God .  I would recommend it.  It's not as long as it looks either.  If either of you want a copy then I can get you a free one.  Jeremiah keeps several copies at his house and gives them away.  He'll be glad to give you one.  Well, for now goodbye.  Lord willing I'll see you both soon.

						   I can't figure out what's going on today... I think we're going down to Greenville but I think we're just going to be finishing stuff up around the house and then coming back up to pick my sister up at the airport.... which isn't cool because that means I miss the Bible Study, Genna's party, and I probably won't even get to see Laura.  Grr...  But that's okay, I mean it's in the Lord's hands right.   I just can't decide what's right; 'cause it's my last week of vacation, and my dad wants to spend some time with me (only he doesn't really have time to spend), but it's also my  last week  of summer vacation and I'd like to do some things with my friends. (i.e. Bible study, genna's party, Daniel's party, etc.)  Well I think I finished my fourth 'song' today... not really finished I suppose but I'm reasonably happy with the melody.  I'm recording  them into the word document on my PDA, so it's pretty cool, like the words are right there and then there's a voice clip of me singing the melody.  It sounds bad for obvious reasons.. =) But hey, make a joyful noise!  It's really great, I think I'm gonna start working a lot more seriously on writing songs.  It's such an awesome release for all the praises I have for God... I'm bad at it but by His grace I'll improve.  The only problem is that there's not enough time in the day to write down everything I want to or sing half the melodies I think of... but that's okay.  Well I have to go I got a thirty dollar over draft on my checking account when there should have been funds there so I'm gonna go call Wachovia.  God bless.

						   Hey, I hope things are going well with you guys.  I can't wait till school starts yet I wish that summer wouldn't end.  Lord willing, I'm going to my last day at work for this summer in just a few minutes.  Pray that I have made a good, Christ-honoring impact and that I would continue to do so.  I've finished 4 chapters of Desiring God and with each chapter I become more convinced of how little I have sought joy in God but have done works out of a mock pious attitude as if God was benefiting from me doing them.  Like I'm doing God a favor!  How carnal!!  Yet through it all God is becoming more and more precious to me.  He is the pearl of great price.  Pray that it doesn't rain on Tuesday and that we continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  See ya.

						   Yo, wow this summer has been a whirlwind. I'm with you Dan that I've learned a ton this summer, a lot of it through less sagacious ways then you... Mostly through screwing things up. =) But hey that's me. I could write for pages on everything I've learned at summit, seriously. I already have probably fifty pages of notes written out. I didn't even really want to go and the Lord blessed me so much anyway. It was awesome, imagine Bible conference, put in some real praise music, put in really interesting/helpful speakers, tons of Christian teens to talk/discuss/debate with about the different sessions, and make it two weeks long. Yeah, it was awesome. We should memorize something together... like take the whole year and do it. I've started on James. I've started memorizing the first chapter and now I'm working on finishing my outline of the whole book to get the main ideas before I move on with actually memorizing it. Well I have to go eat breakfast and go to work. I'm praying for both of you. God bless.

						   I finished the  Life and Diary of David Brainerd  today.  It's an awesome book that is so full of the grace, power, and joy found in God.  By the end of it I had a longing to be absent in the flesh and present with Christ.  That would be awesome.  I also finished the Bible last night.  I plan now to study Hosea b/c that is what we're doing in Bible Study.  It's a great book on God's grace and mercy.  School starts soon and I look forward to the work God is going to do among us.  See ya.  Don't forget about the party!!

						   I have grown so much this summer but with Paul I can truly say that it is not me but the grace of God working through me.  My goal has almost been met.  Tonight I plan to finish Revelation.  I have never felt more inadequate and yet more able for the task (of living for Christ and going to China eventually) that I have before me.  My weakness is great.  My God is above sufficient.  My desire is God.  I wish, pray, and hope that you all have experienced the same.  I have never felt more happy that God is completely sovereign.  I would have it no other way.  Whatever seems best for Him to do with me is fine with me.  He is God.  See you all at school or at my party.  Bye!
