      i want to have food in the house. i'm tired of always being hungry. i want the bills to be paid. i'm tired of going to the movies instead of paying bills. i want to be less sweaty. i'm tired of all the heat i want to go to oregon. i miss my home, my friends. i want to laugh more. i'm lonely i want to be single. i can't spend all my time with one person. i want to smell the beautiful trees of the west coast. i want out.

      I'm writing an account of my life from when I left Oregon in March of 2003 until the present. I'm thinking I might actually write until I move to Jersey, then from Jersey write a New book. The first one is very long.  The rough draft already has 60 pages and that's just the outline. I hope it doesn't drag. There is just so much explination into the head of a girl who doesn't want to settle down, but only wants to settle down in the future of life. I'm such a walking contradiction.  I think that Jersey deserves it's own book. The people, sites, smells, feelings.  I have to write about the 'live in'. How we met, and what he did to me at the begining of our relationship. I have to write about Mr. Penelope. I have to see how this all turns out. It can't turn out boring that's for sure. Nothing in my life has been boring, except for the times I sit at home staring at the computer, just wanting to write.  How can life be boring when there are so many colors. So many beautiful eyes to look into that have so many exciting stories to tell?

      I wonder how long I can really stay here and live in Jersey.  I can't leave yet. I don't have the funds, I don't have a future. I had another dream about the ex I left in Oregon. It was such a sad dream. Once again it was me coming back and asking for forgivness. I woke up this morning and wrote him a quick e-mail. A good friend of mine says I should call him up but I'm to scared and it all seems so complicated. He has a gilfriend who wont let him talk to me. She's right too, I shouldn't talk to him. I do miss him though. wouldn't it be crazy if he wrote back.

      Mr. Penelope is off to Portland. Where I have so many friends I'd love to see. I'm even more jealous. I responded to the last e-mail but I don't know when the next time he'll be online is. I'm not that worried about it, but I do miss talking to him.

      really, if you want to know, i'm so fucked up because of the grand amount of cheese steaks i've eaten in my life.... at times breakfast lunch dinner dessert snack midnight snack midmorning snack....  alright, i think the joke is getting lame now too.  we're trying to get on those boats for work. i'm going to portland today. its all very weird, the situations i'm in, here in seattle mostly, for i'm basically staying with this girl who i think is really starting to like me, she's a friend of mark's friend, and well, the sex thing which will swiss cheese me if i get involved, and well, i already did, and last night some jealousy appeared as i walked to a liquor store with another girl, which leaves me somewhere between mars and the gyuiloids galaxy, in the mind at least, not the girls-the jealousy, it's like what have i become...........    kramer?   sorry if that's too much of my personal life but you said you wanted a friend right? i know basket-cases are a handful but------- you asked.  also, i think i'll be shooting heroin sometime soon. mathmatically, the odds all show a complete downfall and junk seems like the perfect answer.   so what do you want?

       you know, now that i'm a bit sober and it's saturday morning i'm re-reading your e-mail.  so, if the 'live in' is no good do you think you'd do a better job of feeding me cheese steaks? and i'd need 6 a week? damn i have enough selfesteem problems i think i'd die if i ate more then 5 cheese steaks a week. they are good, but are they good 'i've gotta have them every day' good? would you get tired of them? i get tired of the same thing over and over all the time. you know what i really want? well it doesn't matter, i'm not sure anyones wants matter to anyone else. i like the cheese steaks. i like that i saw my first philly rat with you. are you just going to party there in seattle until you come home lifeless and spent? or are you getting a job to support yourself?

      the 'live in' is no good.  no good.  no fucking good lady.  philly is a big cheese steak and nothing else.  you need at least four cheese steaks a week to even carry a smile in the "tri-state area". that just flat out agitates me. no. no no no no no.  a real man will feed you cheese steaks constantly.  cheese steak cheese steak cheese steak  in fact get the 'live in' to this computer now:  dear 'live in', are you kidding me?  this girl is from oregon.  AND YOU WAIT SIX FUCKING MONTHS TO GET HER A CHEESE STEAK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!you put a cheese steak in her mouth right now.  Right Now buddy!     okay i'm a junky this girl amanda says, a bit drunk, yeah oh well salamaders will always be salamanders even if salamanders get extinct and go to salamander hell.

       you are nuts. it's not so late there in seattle though so it's not to bad. if you would of written me and i was awake to recieve and e-mail at 5am, you'd be nuts, i'd be nuts. maybe we could have some beer to go along with the nuts. tiffany told me about the slender penis. slender penis? that's a visual i wanted of mark. of course you're homesick. but you've got to stick it out. what are you going to come home to if you do come back? the same things you've got there in seattle. everyones the same. fuckin same boring ass shit people that are everywhere. the 'live in' took me to southstreet today to get me my first cheese steak. you know. every city is just like the next. i was glad to finally get my cheese steak. i think it's been long enough me being in the area without ever ever having one. but now what? i went to spaceboy music and bought that postal service album, the one with clark gable on in. i could ramble forever.  i got trashed last night and forgot i really fucked up my knee and went to fight splatt in the parkinglot. i instead twisted my knee funny, lost all balance and hit my head on the pavement. to then get up to fall back down again because of the pain in my knee. everyone else was worried about the scratch on my head. bah. my head can heal. i'm just worried my knee never will. i puked and puked and puked last night. it was pretty sad, and yet just seemed like the right thing to do. i took a picture of Bethany and Britney last night at the bar. Britney is grabbing Bethany's boob. i've made posters with the picture and i'm posting it up at dv on sunday.. yep. nice big ole picture of the two lesbos in central.. hahaha....damn i'm really rambling. i have to stop. i'll be up if you want to write back.

      hello again, i hope you don'ty mindy me. im like a stray cat hungry for the touch of a bums hand-- or just food... anyway--- the hip s(e)attle cats went to a party hosted by a gay guy and because im racist, facist, and 100% american i refused to go, alright no, actually im tired and well-deep in thought, (as in water well-- such illuminant poetix), and i figured i wouldn't go and draaaag the paaaartty down maaaan. besides, haven't we all been gettin drunk since sixth grade? i wanna go to the space needle goddamnit! (you see you see-- godamnit) and so ill write to you of my feelings (and what do you know---MEloncholy!) i'll just say it.... i'm homesick. i don't have any godamned shit-fucked cock bitch slut shit idea why. it seems i've been on the computer more often than not writing to (friends?... okay, aquaintances that rather'd not hear my whines anyway...) i mean, where's the friggin' point? the way i look at it (of course depressingly) is that humans should be erased from existence as they serve no purpose to the globe, rather they just waste it, and and and oh, i dunno...... thought, feeling, love, revolution, cartoons.... its as though you think something has any worthwhile cause, and it doesn't, because it's all just a boredom-curer. boredom boredom boredom (and yes i'm cynical)       so funny story time: i'm on the internet and mark got that instant messenger thing on and out of nowhere tiffany's name comes up with something that says '''i've been thinkin about you in the shower''' and i heel over in laughter, and then this line comes up.... '''long slender....penis'' i almost broke my ribs! marks face turns tomato, so i started joking around with her. it was funny, to me at least.   and for the finale......   da dum de dum de dum da dum........        YOU THINK I'M NUTS!!!!!!

      confusion is in the mind of the beholder. i'm glad i met you. and 'the king menace'??? well.... you're a menace for sure but i don't want you to get a big head over the whole thing. ;)  ever hear of a band called phoenix? they are out of the uk, they have an album called alphabetical.

      huh.  the king menace i am.  i'm glad my insanity didn't fully infect you, just a breeze, a nudge nudge.   the air is crisp.  ha ha.  and the mess, my psychological disaster that often filters into awkward reality, its a mess with no intention of clearing.  i have no idea what i want out of life, besides absolutely nothing, and it entangles my thoughts and actions.  because i really do want absolutely nothing... i'd like to sit on top of a hill meditating and writing poetry until i die but HEY, ITS AMERICA FOOL!!  this and that--- ah, i want to run and hide under the kitchen sink.  that's the mess in a paragraph.  okay, well, ill probably just confuse you by qwriting a lot so ill stop. have fun and tent shag for christs sake! bye bye

      hey. i've had a crazy last couple of days, since your departure too. i almost left the live in. i actually told him i was leaving him to move to montana to live with my sister. i couldn't handle having all these feelings for you, and trying to keep all the sane feelings i had for 'the live in' intact. (wow) so yeah. i almost did. then i decided i'd be crazy to leave. he and i get along so well and have so much going with eachother that to throw that much caution to the wind is overboard for me. i've done enough crazy travelinging for a while. i think the talks with you, and really envying your trip to seattle made me miss that open road feeling. being free and alone and not having to answer to anyone. instead of doing all kinda of irration things i've decided to stay in jersey for now. i actually have a second interview at another warehouse that the starting pay is 13.50 an hour. if i can work there pay off all my bills and save money i'd be able to leave whenever i want. it's also hard working at dv. every day i still think of you not being there which sucks. and i struggle to get 40 hours in so i too can be a 21st century digital girl with my cable internet and flat pannel monitor. Oh. that reminds me. i tired calling you but your phone was already disconnected so i didn't get to talk to you. just know i tried. why are things still messy? is it hot there? with no humidity right? (i'm so jealous)  your un-comsic love.

      to my un-cosmic love, hello. i got an email account as im now a 21st century digital boy. i wanted to say im sorry if i was off that night we went out, my head was spinning like the merry-go-round in second grade-- maybe your head was clouded before you left oregon, i dunno, i've been a mess and things seem to just get messier for me (messier?sp)(is it a word?)  anyway, the train ride was gorgeous-- wisconsin and montana are like divine lands of sacredness when the sun falls in its amber glow  seattle is.................TRENDY!  so, alright, write me back if ya want tell me digs yall peash

      how many people actually go through life unhappy anyway? i must make those people sick.  to be one of those people, you know the kind that are married with children and hating their spouses. because, i'm not going to be one of those people, i'm going to keep on moving and expiriencing life to it's fullest. with new people i meet everyday and new romances and new emotions.  you know how crazy it is to meet someone who when you look at them your heart beats faster? your vision blurs everything but them and all you can do is stare? that's how it can be and so many people just settle for less, for whats comfortable.  i don't think i can ever do that.  mr. penelope left today for seattle. i already miss him so much, going to work is hard because every day was a day i'd look for him. i hope he keeps up with his bargain and sends me a postcard, that will be my only saving grace.

      hard for most people. for me, i just want to leave, i don't feel pain until i'm far away and it's too hard for me to get back. my live in doesn't want me to leave, we've had a few conversations today, it's been an emotionally tiring day. try being sympathetic when all you want to do is leave.

      last night i made up my mind to leave. i told my live in boyfriend and it was a pretty hard decision. sitting here i'm not sure it's the right one, and yet it's all i want to do. i just want something different. the live in understood. he said i was a free spirit and that he was sorry he couldn't be for me, what i needed.  i don't even know what i need anymore. i don't want to leave jersey, but i really want to expirience montana. my sister lives there and we'll see what my options are for moving back west. i'd love to be near the west coast, bringing me back to oregon.  i really just don't know about anything.

      today i'm online talking to my friend and she says she spoke with, we'll call him mr. penelope (there is a reason behind that name). so mister penelope got online under a friends of his accound and spoke with my friend. sad thing, he didn't bring me up at all. my friend even asked mr. penelope if he wanted to talk about our meeting this last friday night.  nope.  nothing.  i feel like nothing, and yet still so in love with a mr. penelope.  i'm trying hard to make my relationship with my live in boyfriend normal. it doesn't feel normal but i know i should try. i slept in until late again today. i forced myself to get up and do something. i washed the dishes and cleaned up the kitchen. it's been a mess for the last 3 days. i guess the live in boyfriend doesn't feel like doing them. i don't mind doing them, but i always feel like i'm the only one doing them. i should probably say something so i don't focus on just that.  mr. penelope is leaving this saturday. we'll see what happens after he does drive away.

      a few nights ago i was driving in the car with my live in boyfriend. he was trying to get out of being a dick by saying something nice. he said i was beautiful. i replyed with 'i think you're only sincere when you say things like that while cuming inside me'. honest.  he took that information and stored it in the back of his head somewhere.  last night i wanted to read he wouldn't leave me alone so i gave in and had sex with him. strange thing was towards the end when he was going to cum he started saying alls these things like: 'your so beautiful' 'your the only woman i'll ever love' 'i love you so much'. all this during our usually quiet round of sex. which i like. quiet.  so he feels like the bonds of our relationship my be falutering. i know that has to be it, and so to get to me he felt the need to say all these intimate things during an intimate moment. well it kinda creeped me out. i don't need to be reassured that he loves me or thinks i'm beautiful. i hope this doesn't become a repeated act. sex will lose it's luster.

      i'm currently reading, 'the da vinci code' by dan brown. amazing fiction this guy has created. mostly because i've looked up a few things on the internet and i see the clues he points out in the book. to bad the 'conspiracy' isn't true about the catholic and christian churches being so self-ritcheous and greedy. oh wait maybe that is true. it's a great book though. i'll finish it today i know.  the boy who has my heart asked me if i had ever read it the other night. he was telling me he was going to have to read that book next. who would of guess that i had just started reading it. i hope he finishes it - i know he will love it.  reading keeps my mind occupied during the day. makes it harder for me to focus on what my heart is trying to tell me.

      is there a situation where someone who is potentially scared to death of committment can change their point of view? i get into situations where i start off extremely happy and then i get extremely lonely and want out. i want out! i want to run away screaming until i can breath again. i feel like i'm drowning in a life of 'we, and ours'. i'm selfish and want it to be about 'me and i'. i'm going to break someones heart again sooner or later and they are going to hate me, just like everyone else in my past has hated me.  and i'm drowning i can't breath

      yesterday i was at a house party.  it was a theme party of cowboys and indians. i wasn't going to get dressed up, i don't really get into things like that, but my boyfriend the day of the event went out an bought me a costume. Tiger Lily. i had to cut it all up and take in over 8 inches just so it would fit me.  i ended up playing dodge ball after having way to much to drink and slipped on the grass. i heard a pop in my knee and i decided to sit the rest of the game out. later that night i couldnt hardly move my knee. it's swollen and it hurts like a mutherfucker.  i guess the reason i'm home is so i can start this blog.  my name is christine. i'm from jersey. i'm in love with the idea of love, the passion the romance the mystery. i live with one man, think about another - dream who the next will be.

      I'm standing on the edge of a buildling. I'm at the top looking over. I'm looking down to the streets below. All the people, all the joy laughter and heartache. I want to jump and I want to fly, but I'm scared of death.  I am terrified of heights.  Call it a hunch, but I think I'll be traveling again soon.
