      So so so smooth... That's all i can say about today. Christelle's bicycle had a derailleur problem (which we noticed last weekend) and we tried to fix it... Sadly enough, there wasn't much i could do about it. So i at least cleaned up the chain and greased it up.  Then we headed to her bungalow with her parents. Man, i swear, there are mosquitoes there that are so hungry! Telle managed to break a tap, and we tried to get it fixed. In the end, we just closed the stopper and left it to be fix some other time.  How more romantic to finish the day with your girlfriend but go for a late afternoon walk at the beach! Well that was exactly what we did... A sweat walk on the beach till it was time for me to get back home. *Sigh* (Had to get back early for baptism diner)

       urlLink    urlLink     Haven't posted for some time. There were a couple of things happening in my relationship. The thing is, it wasn't all that bad. It's just that there were things that needed to get sorted out. And as things got sorted, other things propped up... Typical!  But today as i'm getting better from my flue(yeah, got that 3 days ago), I can start to think a bit more straight. What i can see so far, is that the relationship we are sharing is strong.  I'm more than glad to have this woman in my life. She's my baby girl...

      The weekend was what i'd call a typical not so good a start, but sweet in the end.        S  aturday: Spent the whole day waiting for my girlfriend's call to plan the day. At 7pm i had to attend a muslim wedding. When i got back home, i buzzed Christelle(to know what the hell it was all about). This is when i told that my ass got wooped because of something i said the night before. Anyhow, things got kinda sorted out.        S  unday: Woke up early, 06.15am. Got into the Sunday routine, i.e. play tennis with uncle Tim, Ah On, and dad. Had a quick lunch, and off i went on my moped to Christelle's place to spend the day. Had a nice evening there. I tried to show her how to play Zombie (the cranberries song) on the guitar. Then we went for a bicycle ride in the vicinity... geez that wasn't a very good idea! Been a while since i rode a bicycle... so i obviously had some pain to keep pedaling, and besides it was raining. When we got back i got a few treats(Fresh coconut milk & little cookies) from her :) that's the nice part. Then i had some fun with Aurelie &amp; Evan(Christelle's niece and nephew). Evan is still a tiny baby(less than 5 months i think), he's so cute with chubby cheeks :P By 4.30pm i had to leave there for home. Just got enough time to have a nice, quick shower and the off to diner at Lai Min's. All in all, i had a nice time...  p.s At very long last, my Wing Commader movie download(which i started 2 weeks ago) is complete.

      A Thursday afternoon, and here i am about to publish my first blog. Why starting a blog? i really don't know myself. Probably beacause i found Frenchie's (Patrick Pincon) Blogspot fun...  Oh yeah, Patrick is my ex roomie; a tall, half malaysian, half french guy. Last night he added me to his blog posting, and asked me to have a look. I still can't believe he published our msn chat log without asking! Even if i actually don't mind at all :)
