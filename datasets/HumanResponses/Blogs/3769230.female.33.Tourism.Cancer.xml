          You whispered sweet words to me. You gave me so much of yourself that I could not help give you everything in return. You gave me your heart then you showed me your soul.  You whisper sweet words across my screen and tell me that you love me. You send me hugs and kisses, you made me love you and now you are stuck with me.  My heart rules my life and sometimes my head screams Too soon! too fast! and I get scared so I pull away to save myself from getting hurt.  Then I am too far away from you so I come back. I never know my mind but I know my heart and for all the trouble that I am   I LOVE YOU!!  BY STARSONG.

      Well its nearly 10pm and I just got home from a relaxation class, which was really good.  I had been finding myself uptight and feeling stressed  in the last few months, hardly surprising really when you are trying to do a demanding job, working in customer services, have a six year old son who knows his own mind and then with all the uncertainty about what the future will bring (although the future can only be good) it was still subconciously on my mind meaning that I didnt feel I was much fun to be around and was shouting at my son more than usual.  The course is run by people who have experienced stress in the past and have benefited from learning new techniques which enable you to practice relaxation throughout the day and also by recognising the situations which might lead to you feeling stressed and thus avoiding it in the first place. (hope that makes sense)   Anyway it seems to be working. Deep abdominal breathing and relaxed muscles that seems to be the answer.

      Why do weekends go so quickly, back to work this morning and felt like I'd never been away.  I deal with lots of website submissions and queries for the company I work for and they had a busy weekend so most of my day was spent answering various questions about air travel and special assistance.  (I work for an Airport).    Today was the day I posted Scott's Police Force application form off.  After checking it over there were a few bits which needed completing, luckily I managed to get hold of Scott who is on the first day of his LGV driving course, and it went recorded delivery and hopefully fingers crossed we will hear soon if he is selected for the first stage interview.    Played Yu Gi Ho with my son Charlie tonight, somehow I think he cheated but not sure how at this moment in time!

      Well this is my first every attempt at having a blog and I am no expert here, so please bare with me.    Scott went off to Kent this evening to start a four week training course as part of his resettlement entitlement with the army.  He will learn to drive a lorry incase his application for the Police takes along time to process and he will have something to fall back on work wise when he leaves the army in 8 weeks.  We were a little worse for wear this morning due to a really great BBQ we went to last night, it threw it down with rain but we all managed to have a good time and consume plenty of red wine.... hence 'worse for wear'.    Okay, that's enough for now... must get some sleep, it takes me about three days to recover from a really good night out nowadays, I hate to admit!!
