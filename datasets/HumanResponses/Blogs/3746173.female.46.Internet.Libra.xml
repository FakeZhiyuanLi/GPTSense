      I had a big problem last night(6/29/04) and almost ended up in the emergency room, but thankfully, the symptoms abated and I didn't die. I had a severe allergic reaction to something I ate, and I started itching on my back first, then my feet. I was taking off my shoes to scratch my feet, and they got worse, intensely itching. I kept trying to ease the itch, but as it got worse, the itch appeared all over me, even my head. I had hives all over me and welts, my face turned pure red, my hands, feet, and throat all swelled up and turned pure red. I had painful throbbing in my feet, hands, my head, and my heart all thumping really fast. My eyes were rimmed in red when I looked in the mirror, and by that time I started crying. My throat was being squeezed so I couldn't breathe and my mouth felt all swollen. I went to lay down, and thought that would help, then my husband came into the room, and I told him something was really wrong!!!    He doesn't know how to deal with emergencies since I'm usually the strong one in this relationship, mind wise..but I couldn't think, and I was having trouble breathing, and my head felt like it was being squeezed in a vise..so he goes and gets the phone book and calls UMC Quick care and its closed. I went back upstairs to get dressed to get ready to go to the emergency room of whatever hospital was closest, then the symptoms slowly started going away. It took several hours, for them all to go away, well, most anyway. I still feel terrible. I never did get to the doctor, and our medical plan officially starts on the 1rst. So, now I'm trying to see a doctor, and since we can't have our old doctors on our new plan, I have to wait several weeks according to the receptionist I spoke to at a few of them.  Vegas, gotta love it.  We did track down what caused the allergic reaction, and I have to avoid everything with red dye 40 in it. Which is in almost everything orange and red! They put it on fruits, in cosmetics, in soups, salad dressings..its in the salad dressing I was using the last week and a half! Raspberry hazelnut salad dressing. That stuff is poison. But it sure tastes good. I felt like I was going to die last night and that would be a very bad way to go. I want to go in my sleep when im 150.  I have never in my life had to go through what I did last night and I never want to again!!! How did I ever make it for 46 years of my life without this ever happening to me?  You know, I do know why.   When we were kids back in the 50's and 60's, they didn't have all this crap they put into food. Food was more pure. We could eat hamburgers, chicken, turkey, drink milk, eat cottage cheese,etc, all the bad stuff and we worked it all off for one thing and the other thing...they didn't pump all the animals full of hormones and they didn't add FD & C colors to everything to enhance them. They didn't coat our fruits and veggies with pesticides and wax and those damn dyes. Oh the good old days.  Nowadays, kids are so full of dyes, pesticides, hormones and god knows what else with all the genetically modified food crops floating around the united states. Your all guinea pigs and you don't know it. Start reading those labels, get informed. By the time these kids make it to adults, they're lucky they all don't have cancer and die already.  Some of the worst things to quit eating and using now are:  Partially and fully hydrogenated oils High fructose corn syrup Monosodium glutamate FD&C colors, all of them!  Some of the most notorious FD&C colors are Red#40 and Yellow#5.  Hey, I just saw those 2 ingredients on a box of chocolate pudding and lemon pudding in the cupboard. Great. Just friggin great.   You know it's all about profit. They profit off their poison and you are the victim. They don't give a fig how you feel, if you die, because they're making the money..all that green, and to heck with you because more people are born every minute and they will buy their products and by then, there will be worse things in them.   Hydrogenated oils are trans fats. They have been proven to be worse for you than saturated fats which usually mostly come from animals. That is also bad for you because of all the hormones the pump into animals to get them to grow fatter so they can kill the poor innocent things for your eating pleasure.   High fructose corn syrup turns directly to fat in the body. All those overweight people that can't figure out why they can't lose weight, and they're devloping type 2 diabetes, they, quit drinking that darn soda, throw out that jar of miracle whip, ketchup, all the regular mainstream crap they sell in the supermarkets, because its in almost everything you buy.Good luck avoiding it.   Don't forget to add mad cow and mad chicken disease to the list of what you could get besides heart disease, and going into severe allergic reactions akin to anyphylactic shock, which is essentially just about what happened to me last night!!  Read those labels. Get informed! Check out red40.org for more info on dyes and allergies. Some of these allergies are fatal. That means that's it, no more anything, your gone. For more food allergy info, check out About.com. They have everything under the sun about everything. A great site!   I'm not ready to leave this world yet, so I'm going to be very very careful for now on and no more FD&C anything!! I'll report on if it makes a difference in how i feel,etc. Will be a good experiment.

      I've noticed some new and interesting lineups for the fall season coming up. "Lost" looks like a really good series. From what I've seen on the previews, I will definitely watch that.  In the previews it shows all these people on an airplane. Something happens on the plane, it falls apart midair and it crashes on a remote island. 48 survive. Then something stalks them and starts killing them one by one. Creepy. But very interesting. Will be on abc.   The other one is "Desperate Housewives." Think Stepford Wives from hell. I think that will be a really good one too. :) On abc also.  There are so many stupid reality show spinoffs since Survivor first aired. I have watched Survivor from the beginning, and still like it. Although the first is still the very best. What I don't like about Survivor anymore is they cannot think for themselves on that show and always have to make alliances. How about having a Survivor and they cannot talk to each other who they are voting out, or have alliances. That alone would make it more interesting. Hear that Jeff Probst? Make them comply. I'm tired of wimpy can't think for themselves lemmings pretending to be survivors.  I do like some of the other reality shows, but they have just gone too far. Look at the big waste of money from the Bachelor and Bachelorette shows. They really go to extremes for these people to find a match, and they always end up picking the wrong person and they break up. Ok, there are a few exceptions. Trista and Ryan. I just hope after the millions they spent on their wedding that they actually stay together at least 5 years. I have doubts, but you never know. They could be soul mates. I still feel that she would have chosen Charlie. He was more manly than Ryan, or maybe it was the way they edited it all. Ryan seemed a little wimpy, but it could have been camera shyness and he is really a normal guy off camera. Let's hope so. That's probably it.  Then theres Meredith (Bachelorette)and the one she picked. She should have picked the other guy as he was very family oriented and that was what she led everyone to believe she wanted. I don't think their union will last, because the guy she chose had serious doubts about commitment. I hope they last.   Then there's the "Who wants to marry my Dad". New ways to embarass yourself on national tv. Especially when the "dirty little secrets" come out. lol Why do I watch this stuff? Because it's there and in the summertime, there is virually nothing on tv. I can only last so long online as it hurts my eyes after long periods of typing and reading. So tv is a brainless sport. Can just lay back and watch til it puts you to sleep.  I do feel like regular programming may take precedence in the coming season and eventually the stupid reality shows, (the good ones will stay) will be on the way out. One can only hope so.

      Health Fact: Most people fart 15-20 times a day. However, vegetarians do much more.   Did you know that 100 years ago, most women only washed their hair once a month and used borax or egg yolks for shampoo.  No televisions, no stereos, no computers, no malls..boredom is what killed the dinosaurs.  Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.  Q. What animals name literally means "I do not know" in the aborigine language?  A. Kangaroo.  Why isn't baby powder made from babies? Why aren't girl scout cookies made from girl scouts? Why isn't cat food made out of cats? (or is it?) Why aren't dog biscuits made out of dogs? (or is it?) Cheesecloth is not made from cheese. Otherwise everyone would be eating it. Animal crackers are not made out of animals.  I sleep on hay and eat my bed instead of making it. (i really don't,but i heard that somewhere)  This is a true story: Somewhere, Africa I think, a wild orangutan attacked a man and took all of his clothes, even his underwear. So somewhere out there, there is a strange looking accidental tourist wandering around.  Another maybe true story: Once upon a time, there was a castle on a hill, way way up on a hill way way in a deep forest. Anyway, it was somewhere out there somewhere.  It was a dark and stormy night, and these 2 mice snuk into the castle. Lightning kept lighting up the castle and thunder scared the heck out of the mice. Finally one mouse could not stand it any longer and slipped into a knights armor. The other mouse looked all over but could not find his friend. The mouse inside the armor got stuck and started calling for help. "Help! Help! Help me make it thru the Knight!"   Meanwhile, in another part of the castle, 2 ants were seeking refuge from the storm. One crawled into the toilet and another found refuge behind the sink. The next morning, the ants met up with each other and talked about their night. The first ant said "I slept behind the sink and I kept nice and dry." The second ant said, "I crawled into this giant porcelain monstrosity. It rained and stormed all night, and if it weren't for that log that floated by, I'd have drowned."  Ring tones that would annoy the heck out of me: The theme to the Meow Mix commercials Who let the dogs out It's a small world  Scoopophobia: The fear of being looked at.  Automysophobia: the fear of being dirty.  If humans could leap like fleas, they'd jump over 100 story buildings in a single bound. (just think of the transportation savings)  Anteaters never get full of eating ants. They're full of anty-bodies.  Blonde joke: A blonde woman walks into a store. Curious about a shiny looking object, she asks the clerk "What is that?" The clerk replies "It's a thermos." "What does it do?" the blonde asks. The clerk says "It keeps hot things hot and cold things cold." So she buys one. The next day, she brings it to work with her. Her boss, also a blonde asks "What is that shiny thing?" "It's a thermos" the first blonde replies. Her boss asks "What does it do?" The first one says "It keeps hot things hot and cold things cold." Her boss asks "What do you have in there?" The first blond replies "2 cups of coffee and a popsicle."  Blonde snake joke: Two snakes were having a conversation. One, the blonde said to the other "Gee, i hope I'm not poisonous." And the other said "Why's that?" And the first one said "Because I just bit myself."  My most favorite blonde joke ever:  A guy comes home from work and finds his blonde wife crying over the kitchen sink with her hands in the warm dishwater. He asks her what's wrong. His wife, still crying says "I dropped the ice cube tray on the floor and I was washing the ice cubes off and now I can't find them!"   When connected to an EEG machine, a bowl of lime jello shows movements that are almost identical to the brain waves of a healthy adult. (i bet they used someone from the move to lv boards for that test)  Know what one coffin said to the other? "Is that you coffin?"  Q. What is the difference between men and government bonds? A. The bonds mature.  Trivia time: Q. What's the longest place name in America? A. Lake Chargoggagoggmanchauggauggagoggchaubunagungaamauugg It has 17 g's. This is an Nipmuck indian name which means "You fish on your side, and I fish on my side and nobody fishes in the middle."  A sign I used to have on my front door to ward off evil solicitors: All solicitors will be eaten by the dragon. The dragon is watching you now. You have 10 seconds to run for your life. Have a nice day. :)

      That is if you buy your car from Carmax. Not just any Carmax. The Carmax in Las Vegas. The one on W.Sahara. Hank is the dude to see. Not only is he a very likable guy, he is also really nice. Genuinely nice. He will even go home with you and cook for you! That's like a bonus. The only downside, he doesn't do the dishes! But he's trainable. He also makes an excellent chauffeur. I am seriously considering having Alan, (a friend of ours) making Hank his new chauffeur when he buys his limousine. (that's still just a good idea Alan has) Anyway, getting back to car buying.   No longer does it have to be a hassle. The price you see is the price you get. (well, taxes and license are extra, but you knew that already, right?) Hank goes out of his way for you. He goes the extra mile. He went more than a mile for us as he drove me home while "D" drove the van home. Since they only wanted to give us $150 for our van, we said "no way jose" we can sell it for more on ebay. You can sell most anything on ebay, even people! Consider that when your husband ignores you too much or when your kids do the same. ;)  Carmax even does the legwork at the DMV for you, getting the title and license plates. How cool is that? Then they fedex everything to you overnight. We were approved right away for the montly payment we originally expected. We have a beautiful used(new to us) 2002 PT Cruiser. Steel grey. Matches the curtains I wanted to buy for our livingroom. Almost matches our carpet, but we do not intend to park it in our livingroom. ;)   If you still want the experience from hell from a regular used car lot, go ahead, and try and fend off those salivating piranha like salesmen. Try to leave and they throw themselves at you, wrap their tentacles around your ankle and hang on like a big dead weight. Meanwhile pleading with you "Please buy our car! Please! It's a piece of junk, it's only had 3 accidents, you'd never know the frame was twisted like a pretzel, but it's a good deal! Please, it's my very first day! I want to make a sale! It's my lifelong dream!" yada yada yada til the cows come home..  Then having been a dumbass and giving them our number, they call 5 million times a day begging and pleading, and making the price lower and lower, then higher and higher, then lower, then finally I call them back and threaten them with bodily harm if they call back anymore. So the calls stop. For 5 seconds. I did actually lie to the guy and promised him I'd send 500 of my closest pals to buy a car from him. I forgot to tell him that they wouldn't be there til hell froze over, but oh well. ;) The nice people I like to help, the mean ones, well, I won't say what I think of them. I will just think it.   Don't forget, go to Carmax and see Hank if you live in Vegas. He works 3 days during the week, and all day saturday. Don't forget, he is the best cook in Vegas! Take him home and let him cook you dinner. You will not be sorry. :) Sorry ladies, Hank is a very married man. He has been married for 35 years and he's not going anywhere. So if you had designs on him, he's not for sale. lol Besides, his wife loves that cooking too much! haha

      What if we are? Ever wonder? It could be like that strange movie "The Others." Where Nicole Kidman played a strange woman with her strange children. They turned out to be ghosts and all that time they thought the people living in the house were ghosts.  Parallel universes maybe? Other dimensions? Why would our existence be the only one?  I have seen visions in my life that were very real. I was awake. I see things before they happen alot. Alot of things I see would scare the heck out of you. And if you talk about these things in public too much, people think your nuts. Or something related to it. I don't really care because I know what I know. As for alien abductions, those I have not seen..well, except that one "dream" I had related to it. It was really strange. A beam of light coming thru the window in the dream that turned into a conveyor belt type of thing. I lay down on it and it floated away. Dreams are weird. I figure it was just a dream, because I really don't know if I believe in alien abductions. If an alien is going to abduct me, let it look like E.T and it will be ok. lol

      People that slurp their drinks and chew with their mouth open. Were they raised by wolves? Raised by barn rats? Who cares if they do it at home as long as they don't invite me over.  People that do not know how to spell. They are everywhere online. Or they butcher words like convenience. They spell it convience. I suspect they were educated in Las Vegas, NV. It seems to be an epidemic out here. People that cannot spell and people that use bad grammar. There is such a thing as spellcheck, so why don't they use it? I always check my posts before posting them to make sure everything is spelled right. If I'm tired, and I notice a typo, I immediately go and edit the problem.  Where were the teachers that teach in Nevada taught? Walmart perhaps? I was not raised here, thank goddess for that. Although most people that live in Vegas have come from all over the world. I really have a hard time believing that there are so many uneducated people running loose in Vegas. Maybe they're the "hillbilly" type that so many complain of on the local message boards.  People that don't use their turn signals. Or people that speed up when you do use your turn signal, thereby blocking you from going into their lane. Everything seems to be a race here in Vegas. The one that crashes their car first wins? Unfortunately, that same mind set of these people that have to be first everywhere, also results in unnecessary deaths, because the idiots take innocent people with them by smashing into their cars. They are also the notorious red light runners. Woe to the pedestrian if they start walking across the street right when it shows the "walk" signal. Most likely some ignorant cell phone driving idiot will run them down as they run through the red light on their way to nowhere.   People who leave their dog out all night so the dog can bark incessantly, wake people up, and keep people awake. We live in a townhome community, and according to the rules that hardly anyone seems to follow(mainly the renters), "dogs are not to annoy any one person in the community, or they are subject to violations." Is the dog subject to the violation? Or are the stupid owners? That one's a tossup.

      What's on my mind: Too many things. I can't sleep. I can't turn off my mind. I lost my great love Fluffy. He was the sweetest little guy, 13 1/2, my furkid. It's been a little over 2 months now, but feels like 2 years. His partner Marmalade went almost 2 years ago to cancer.He was 11 1/2.  Fluffy had a tumor on his stomach. It wouldn't let him eat. He was a featherweight when he died. :*( Mandy went 8 years ago. She was 18, lived a good life for a kitty. I miss her always and forever.

       My husband fixes tv's for a living, and last week he went to a home of a woman that lives past Red Rock canyon. She has a ton of cats(around 50 or so), alot of dogs(they greet you at the gate), and any little critter that wanders on in, she takes in. And Dave said it smells like it too. ;)   She had a huge projection tv, about a 65 inch. He set to the task of taking the back off, a million little tiny screws and while working,cats were on him, under him, around him, in his tool box, on the tv, peeking in the tv,etc. He felt a little distracted. LOL. I think anyone would. ;)    &nbsp;  He finally finishes fixing the tv, the woman signs the work form, and he leaves. About an hour after he left, his boss calls him and said the woman was missing a cat. Dave said he didn't take it. And with all those cats, how would she know any were missing? Maybe she does a head count every hour. That's a good guess.     &nbsp;  The next morning, when Dave shows up for work, his boss calls him in to talk to him. His boss is smiling. And proceeds to tell Dave the story of the missing kitty.   About a half hour after Dave left to do more service calls the day before, the woman keeps hearing a meowing sound and does a cat count? and realizes one is missing. She looks under the couch, behind furniture, on the tv, everywhere. As she glances at the tv, she sees a shadow cross the screen that looks like a cat. She gets closer to the tv and realizes the missing cat is in there. So she panics, and calls the service center. The service center tries to get ahold of Dave, but he's at his next appt, and his phone is off. So they call her back and ask her what she wants to do. If they should send Dave back, or if she wants to take care of the matter herself. Because it would be another few hours before Dave could make it back there.    &nbsp;  She finally decides to get a screwdriver and take the back off of it herself, and out comes her kitty. Hungry as can be. lol I think next time, she might want to keep the kitties away from the tv or really check it before the tv is all back together. :)    &nbsp;

      I have not been feeling well for the last week. Ever since the allergic reaction, I haven't been the same. I finally have a doctor's appt this saturday with a new doctor with our new healthplan. I had a choice of "Golden Triangle" and "North" for locations. So i picked the name I liked the best, the first one. :) I used to watch horse racing on tv back in Calif. It used to be on right when I came home from work. I used to pick the horses with the names I liked best, and they either always won or they came in second. I told Dave this the other day.  He told me I could make money on my talent. I may try this sometime if I ever feel better!  I hate being so tired and in chronic pain day after day. I'm too young to feel this way. :(
