      Struck down by sickness I'm at home, losing my lifelong battle of trying to get enough sleep.  There is just no such thing as enough.  This is the only reason I'm starting the blog in the first place, I’m sick and there is quite literally nothing else to do and no one around to complain to.  So I’ve started a blog for no other real reason then to complain about how I hate online journals.  (Example of your most basic form of hypocrisy.)   Top Ten Reasons Online Journals Are Stupid  10.	There are way too damn many of them.  It was cool when the first 2 or 3 people started one, but now it’s just old, overdone and quite literally a fad for people who just want to engage in little self-importance.    9.	It costs money unless you feel like dealing with ads.  I’m cheap and wear my ads with pride.  8.	Somewhere along the line the web-design aspect of online Journals became more important then the writing.  I’m all for good web design but I’m tired of these ridiculous journals where someone has spent “weeks” designing a website (of which he/she simply stole from another website) that has an insanely small Arial font that I have to strain to read, only to find that all they have written about is that cute thing their boyfriend/girlfriend said last night.  Eat shit for wasting my time.   7.	The good ones never last.  Truth be told intelligent talented writer’s have little time and better things to do then write an online journal.  There are some good ones out there, but the second some of these people realize they are wasting their time writing for free (no wait, paying someone else to write) they stop journaling and get busy writing for cash.  6.	The templates suck, but I use them anyway.  (See # 8)  5.	NO ONE.  I REPEAT, NO ONE READS YOUR JOURNAL.  Seriously guys, do you really think you have fans?  You don’t.  The only people who even attempt to glance through your journal are maybe one or two of your closer friends.  That’s it, and they are only looking to see if you wrote something about them.  This brings me to number 4.  4.	There are some people, I’m not naming names, screw it yes I am.( urlLink Paul ,  urlLink Jon ) who have very nice online Journals.  (Course I have to say that because they’re my friends, no seriously…)  But every now and then, they say a little more then they should.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m not about the censorship however,  I seem to remember a couple of fights that broke out because of things said online that either wasn’t all that flattering ( urlLink Paul ) or things repeated that were told in confidence ( urlLink Jon ).  Unless you enjoy fighting with your friends, if you’re gonna write about them say only nice things or make sure they don’t have the web address.   3.	There are some people out there who will read someone’s journal, listen to none of it, and then e-mail the author with all the spelling mistakes they found.  Get a life, or a job as an editor, which ever comes first.  Let me clear it up for everyone right now,  I know there are spelling mistakes, I just really couldn’t give a rat’s ass, you get the point.  2.	People care way too much and try way too hard to get people to read their online journal.  I ask someone how they are doing and they have the nerve to say “Well just read my journal!  Here’s the address…”  Fuck you and your journal just fuckin’ tell me! I was just being nice anyway!  1.	And the Number One all-time worst thing about online journals is that there are way too many people who just use it to do nothing but complain and make stupid Top Ten Lists that have no real meaning.  If even one person actually wasted their time reading this spew of crap I’ve written,  my job is done.  Thank You and Goodnight!  RMM
