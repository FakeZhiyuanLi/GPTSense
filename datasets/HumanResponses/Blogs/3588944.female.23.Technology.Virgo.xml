      No, I didn't forget to write.  Well, ok...kinda...but not really!  See, my neice was in town, so I was busy for 5 days, and then I had a lot of catching up to do at work, so...ok, no more excuses.  I am here!  Today sucked. No, this morning sucked. The day has been ok.  So, here is what happened.  A couple of days ago I took my puppy, Zelda, to get spayed.  Poor baby...  Anyway, it was a single day thing, and I picked her up later that night.  She was fine all night, all lovey and stuff.  The next morning she awoke with such a fury and energy about her, I couldnt control her!  She has been like this since.  I thought it was because i have kept her locked up in the kennel to keep her away from my older dog so she wouldn't hurt herself, but I have been keeping her out the last 2 days, and there is no change.  She is a monster!  She won't sit, she won't leave anything alone, she now growls and barks at people...none of these things is normal for her.  HELP!  She is a baby hell hound.  Anywho, this morning she was so bad...I was going crazy!  Anyway, again, work backons me. I must go.  I just needed to vent. =)

      Ok, so here we go again!  Remember that "work" thing I spoke about yesterday?  Yup...it's still here. Damn.  Maybe someday it will go away.  But honestly, I think I would be lost without work.  I get bored very easily.  Ask anybody.  They'll tell you.  I can jump off of  the worlds largest and craziest roller coaster, turn around and say "Now what - I'm bored"  In fact, I am bored right now.  So, you see, not having to work would actually be bad for me.  I would go crazy, I think.  I don't think I could find enough amusing things to do every day for the rest of my life if I wasn't at work 1/3 of my life and sleeping another 1/3 of it.    HA...I say "my life", as if I had one.  Funny.  So, a little about what has been going on the last few years.  Well, as I was graduating High School one of my ex-boyfriends was trying to talk me into giving him another chance.  When his attempts failed (miserably) he had one of his friends talk to me online.  ***Guys, if you are reading this - DON'T DO THIS!  STUPID!  BAD!***  You see, as soon as this friend started talking to me, I found he was very easy to talk to and a lot of fun.  I ended up waiting for him to get online whenever I could, and we talked until the wee hours of the morning.  So, 2 months later, we met face to face.  It's funny, we lived 1/2 hour away from each other for so many years, and this is how we meet.  After that point, we were inseparable.  We dated for 4 1/2 years, and got married in January of 2003.    This past year, our first life changing decision was made.  He got a job offer in another state.  I had a great job which I had been working there for 3 years.  These people were like my family!  But, I knew this was a wonderful opportunity.  So, we moved.  We don't have any family for 600 miles each way, and not a friend in the state.  I had a dog though.  She was lonely too, as her companion, a quirky cocker spaniel, past away from cancer this past summer.  And so, we bought a puppy from a rescue shelter.    Well, now I feel like I have 2 kids.  My older dog is now acting the age of the puppy.  So now, although I still have a lack of people friends, I have 2 wonderful dogs I come home to.  So even if I wanted to have friends, I don't have time for them now.  *blah*  So, in a nutshell, there is my life for the past 5 years.  Boring, huh?  Yup.  There has been some drama and some excitement, but fortunately for you, I am not going to privilege you with this information.    And as for you people who are wanting to correct my spelling and grammar....don't.  Please.  I really don't care.  If I wanted to get my blog graded or criticized for spelling, I would email it to my old teachers.  Thanks.

      Wow!  My very first blog post.  Ya know, I wish they had these when I was in High School.  Back then, I loved to type, but never had a chance.  Back then, homework was actually hand written 99% of the time *gasp*  Yes, it's true!  Anyway, my outlet was that of a personal diary on floppy disk.  I would keep the disk with me everywhere I went so nobody (my mom) would find it, and anytime I needed to vent, I would find the nearest computer with a disk drive.  Back in the day, I was very poetic, and very emotional, so poems took up about 40% of the disk space I used.  Don't worry, I won't subject you to my recent lame attempts at poetry. You see, I have no motivation anymore.  I don't have the over-exaggerated emotions of a teenager any longer.  I have settled and am very happy with my life.  So now what do I write poems about?  Work.  Sleep.  Money.  Butterflies? Nothing poem-worthy.  I used to write about those fleeting crushes I had, and how broken hearted and yet so in love I was.  I look back on these entries now, and find an endless supply of amusement.  I used the word "love" in every other sentence, even though I didn't know what it meant.  I liked a different boy every week.  And sometimes, more than one!  Funny how life can change in a few short years.  I will go on more about this at a later time.  Although this is my first entry, and I have so many years to catch up on, I have so much less time for it now.  Work beckons me back to reality.  And so, adieu...
