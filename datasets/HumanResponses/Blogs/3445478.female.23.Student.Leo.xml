      Today, Shawn took Nick up to Menard's to pick up something and when he was leaving the parking lot-actually BEFORE he left his parking spot-another car hit our back drivers side panel. Thank God Nick was strapped in his car seat in the middle of the back seat and not right behind the drivers seat or he could have been really hurt. Shawn & Nick are ok. The other vehicle doesn't even have a scratch on it! My Toyota Echo is obviously not great in accidents!  Hopefully ...It's considered totaled and we can get a better family car!!!  Last night Shawn & I finally completed Nick's hand and foot prints in clay and mounted it on the wall in a frame.   Only 19 1/2 hours until Shawn leaves =(   Tomorrow is our 2 year wedding anniversary!!! SOmetimes it seems like we got married yesterday and other times it feels like*in a good way*we've been together forever!

      Yesterday, Shawn & I took Nick up to my mom's for Nick's 1st fire. He wore his brand new Carhart overalls. Nick looked sooooo hansom. My mom captured the cutest picture of Nick laughing. Austin (Nick's future uncle) tickled Nick's cheek and it made him smile so huge and even "talk!!!" Nick mostly slept during his 1st fire so he seemed to enjoy it. Shawn installed our carpet in the living room yesterday and it looks and feels like HOME! The carpet brightens up the place and draws you into the livingroom. Shawn did an amazing job =) Right now he & Nick are rocking on our rocking chair. Nick's eyes are rolling into the back of his head. They look precious together. I can't believe how much I am going to miss Shawn. He has been Super*Dad to Nick lately and the best husband. I LOVE having him home.

      Today, Nick & I went to our favorite coffee shop and then to the lake walk. It was so beautiful out. When we got home-after I dropped my hot(cold) chocolate on the ground-there was a package for Nick, from Mimi. "Mimi" is a nickname of my dad's grilfriend Carol. Enclosed was the most beautiful knit green sweater vest. I love it sooooo much! I hurried & feed Nick just so I could put it on him and take pictures. Later on, Nick & I went to Grampsie/Gramsie Koski's for Uncle Bill's birthday party while Shawn went out with his buddy, Charlie.  Pretty full day. Nick has been in such a good relaxed mood all day!-very easy going which is unusual for him ;)  Shots are comming up next Wednesday! Poor Nick! Thank Gosh Grandma Lu is coming with us because Shawn will be in the cities starting his internship. I am not looking forward to Nick's shots at all. I can hardly stand taking my "shewster", Keely's cat (Puddy) to the vet without getting dizzy!-Empathy.  Tomorrow is going to be great. Shawn has the whole day off! I can't wait to spend time with him.

      I have started teaching Nick sign language. He is learning milk (formula), full, more, & sleep. I read in a magazine that by 6 or 7 months, he will be able to sign back to me! I can't wait because it is so frustrating not knowing what he wants, like if he's hungry or too full...AHhhhhh!  Shawn & Nick are embarking on a shopping adventure right now. They are on their way to McDonalds for salads, and then to Target. This is Shawn's first time taking Nick out all by himself. GOOD LUCK SHAWN! Today, Nick & I visited Grandma Lu at the Police Station for a minute & Nick got lots of kisses!  -Grandma Lu works as an investigator for the Duluth Police Department.-

      Today Nick sat upright in his crib all by himself!-I placed his hands onto the bars of his crib and he kept himself up long enough to take a picture! He did so many situps today-Poor Boy.  I am reading an amazing book called, The Five People You Meet In Heaven. I can hardly put it down, but I don't want to finish it yet because it is soooo good. I put Nick in our Baby Bjorn front carrier and walked around our apartment to get in some reading time this afternoon.  Nick's room is almost complete!!! We decided to put carpet in his room closer to fall because we don't need it yet. We will need carpet in our living room soon so Nick has more opportunities for tummy*time.-Even though he hates tummy*time with a passion. Shawn & I decided to go with a "Finding Nemo" fish theme. It looks great and Nick stared at all the pictures in his swing today for 45 minutes! I think he likes it, too.  Grandma Lu bought "Christian" Nick his first pair of carhart pants today! I can't wait to see Nick in them =) He is going to look adorable.  Only eight days until Shawn begins his internship in the cities. Nick & I are in search of some sort of play group.

      Nick had an allergic reaction to the Elidel he started on yesterday. Poor Boy! That was why he hadn't stopped screaming since yesterday early afternoon. I called the Dr finally this morning around 10ish and they said to wash his head off and just use the cortizone. Today, Nick & I hung out at the mom's~G'ma Lu. I got a chance to lay out in the sun & burn while Nick played and slept. Overall, relaxing afternoon especially compared to yesterday, last night and this morning! Nick did not sleep while. Shawn got home around 11pm and we stayed up until midnight and Nick was up by 3. Ick! I could not get him to fall back asleep so finally, I told Nick he had one more chance to be good in mommy's bed before he is sent to his crib...Alone! He used up that chance so I brought him to his crib and climbed into bed and 30 seconds later...HE'S PLAYING! And it's 4 am...Sleep time! Ahhhhhhhhh. Yesterday when I was trying to get him to nap, he grabbed my face so hard. I told Nick, No! And do you know what my naughty boy did...He smiled and laughed! I laughed, too! I can't resist a sweet face like his =)

      Nick has screamed almost all day long! Nothing has helped him. I called Shawn in tears to hear his voice. Shawn said he'd come home and I told him not to and that I just needed to hear his voice and it made me feel better already. To make a long conversation short, he's on his way home!~for the night and then he has to leave by 4:30 am. What an amazing husband. I think he just felt like he needed to come home. I feel guilty though. I am worried about him driving all these miles and being exhausted. I gave Nick benadryl and feed him and right now he's out for the count. I didn't want to give him benadryl because the pharmacist was surprised the Dr recommended it for someone as young as Nick. The dose recommends by our Dr is 1/2 tsp and the recommended dosage for a 6 yr old is 1 tsp...Nick is only 3 months old! I was planning on calling the Dr again tomorrow to confirm the benadryl dose recommendation but I didn't know how eles to help Nick. I used all the resources I had and then some. I tried ever trick I knew of. Poor Boy!

      Today Nick had a DR APPT and we found out he has eczema on his head and a little on his cheek. I picked up elidel, hydrocortizone, Aveeno soothing moistere cream, J&J baby shampoo ect...oh, and benadryl.  Poor Nick . He weighs close to 18 pounds now! He is such a big boy.  I start work on Saturday... THIS SATURDAY ! Shawn and Nick are going to have a great chance to bond Saturdays while I work. I had to go to the mall and get black pants for my uniform. Ick! Nick up...Got to go!

      I just finished a book called, Sarah. It is about Sarah & Abraham.   IT WAS SO GOOD ! I am almost shaking! I love when a book can transport you to another time...to become so involved with the book and characters that their emotions become tangible. Ahhhhhh! Good Book. Today was beautiful! I set up Nick's swing outside our back door and actually got to lay out for almost an hour! Nick slept basically slept through the night!~He got up around 1 but the pacifier worked its magic and put him to sleep until 5. Then we both slept until 9!!! Lucky us. We went on a long walk today, too. He also had tummy time and only fussed for 5-10 minutes before falling asleep on his  left  side which is great. Nick turns his head to the right when he sleeps and just in general all the time...so his head is now flat...YES FLAT on the right side. All the time I can get him to be on his left side will even it all out and make his skull more round. This happens all the time to babies and it will go back to normal...I hope ;) In August, Shawn & I are going to Valleyfair for his work picnic! I am so excited. I  love  rides!!! The faster the better.  Nick and I miss Shawn a lot. He both got used to having him home. I found out yesterday (& it's been on the news too) that Shawn will be going to Iraq from May 1st until Aug 30th next year. After that, he'll be home for good!!! No more leaving!!! Thank God!!! At least next summer, I will be busy with Skills  all  summer long! But, Shawn will miss my graduation. =(

      Yesterday on my way to pick up my sister, I stopped at the ATM machine and discovered I have to go back to work soon. Keely, Nick and I were headed down to Canal Park anyway, so I stopped by Hawthorn and talked with two of my bosses and will be picking up a weekend shift every weekend. Shawn will have to babysit Nick while I work on Saturdays/Sundays. Each week it will probably be different. I'm excited and dreading it all at the same time. I absolutely love being home with Nick. He is changing so much daily. Tonight is girls night out! Miranda & I are going to Chi Chi's. Tonight is the 1st time Shawn will be babysitting Nick. Good Luck Shawn! Tomorrow is Shawn's guys night out. I finally got my car back!!! I love it!!!

      Nick tried rice cereal fo rthe 1st time last night. He has always been an incredibly greedy eater and both Shawn & I could not get the cereal down fast enough as the bottle goes down. So, Nick cried and fussed with each attempt. The good part is, whatever we got in,  stayed in ! He just wanted his bottle more. But, I am going to try it again through out today and tonight.  Dinner turned out great! I even did the cleaning up!

      Shawn's coming home today!!!!!!! I am  so  excited. Nick & I went to the store and got the ingredients for meatballs, sauce, brownies, & strawberry's w/chocolate sauce. I already made the brownies but they didn't turn out so well. At 4, Nick and I are going to visit G&G Koski. Hopefully they can borrow me 2 slices of bread. I forgot to get bread and don't want to go back to the store. I'm looking forward to going up there. Then, Nick will  help  me cook for his daddy.

      Today was cleaning day. I cleaned and cleaned and cleaned and I am still not done...Ahhhhhhhh! I don't think I've scrubbed the floors  really well  since Nick was born. So, it was about time! This afternoon Nick & I went up to G'ma Lu's to do laundry and eat dinner. Billy & Austin made Nick laugh like crazy! It was so cute. Then we went home for bath, bottle and bed. He's sleeping right now!!! The best part of my day today was taking a nap with Nick. We fell asleep around 9:40ish until 11:25! I love snuggling with Nick and falling asleep. Tomorrow Shawn comes home for 5 nights and 5 days. I get used to having him home on the weekends so during this 5 day stint, I know I am going to get really used to having him home and it's going to be hard when he leaves on Sunday. Kind of like starting all over with him being gone. I've finally got used to it being just Nick & I during the week.

      On Friday morning Pam, Shawn, Nick & I drove down to Cottage Grove. We went down to the cities area for Brooke's baby shower-she's due on July 9th and we stayed at Megan & Dave's beautiful new home. I absolutely love their home!!! If I could design and build a house, I would like it to resemble their home. That night we went out to eat and Nick was  a bit  crabby due to being in his car seat almost the entire day. The next day was the shower. The guys all went out to a movie and we girls stayed at Megan & Dave's for the shower. Megan did an incredible job! We played a fun game-we were given a piece of gum and had a few minutes to mold the gum into a baby! At the start of the shower, we all introduced ourselves and gave Brooke a piece of advice. I thought this was a great idea. There was another baby there who was 3 1/2 months old. Her mom said she slept through the night from the 1st night home from the hospital...BS!!! 1st of all, her baby breastfeeds and that requires the baby to be up every few hrs at night to eat as breastmilk goes though a baby faster and easier than formula does. I don't like mom's who lie. It's ok to say that your baby is not perfect and gets up once or twice during the night. Even if you attach your baby to your breast at night and go to sleep and your baby feds itself, it is still waking up and eating  not  sleeping though the entire night! OK, I'm done venting... Sunday, today, is father's day.  HAPPY FATHER'S DAY SHAWN !!! This morning we went to a Father's Day brunch. It was so good! Megan and I had an orange juice and champagne drink. I think it's called, omarosa or something like that.-It was great for sipping. This afternoon Nick, Shawn and I got to nap together and shortly later Pam, Nick and I headed back home. This weekend, Nick discovered fruit...strawberry's and catalope. He also sucked on a cookie. I think he's both teething and going through his 3 month growth spurt. Overall, he did great this weekend. Thank you Dave and Megan for letting Nick & I enjoy your beautiful home!

      Thank you Thank you Thank you G'ma Lu for babysitting Nick last night while Shawn & I went out to dinner and got alone time. Shawn completely surprised me!!! I knew he was getting off work early and thought he would come to Duluth to surprise me and Nick and he called pretending to be in the cities still. I had just woken up from a 10 min nap and was out of it. I bought the story and hung up promptly because I was so sad he wasn't here. I climbed back into bed to continue my nap with Nick. I really thought he'd come up to Duluth. 20 minutes later I hear someone mowing our lawn-I jump up and guess what...YEP!!!!! Shawn's Home!!!!!!! He drove up for 14 hours and now we all are heading back to the cities for Brooke's baby shower. What a husband!!! He's the best!!!

      Today I took Nick on a  LONG  walk and he came home and napped! I actually got him to nap with me!!! We went to Target today and I forgot one of my bags and a very sweet lady chased me down to let me know. I would have been so disappointed to have got home and discovered 1/2 my things were not there. After that, we went to Cub foods. I was exhausted and sweaty and sooo ready to go home by the time we got to Cub...Of course, I ran into a very old acquaintance. Isn't that just the way it goes. Whenever I look my best and am out in public I never see anyone I know, but when I am looking terrible I see  everyone ! Finally, Nick & I made it home to unload the car, make dinner and put Nick through an awful ordeal of tummy time. Do other infants hate tummy time too, or is it just Nick??? I talked to a mom of a 7 month old girl yesterday and asked her about tummy time when her daughter was Nick's age and she said, what's tummy time! Her 7 month old daughter weighs 20 #'s...My  3 month old  son weighs 16#'s at least! I am starting to worry that he's going to keep growing and growing and growing and never stop. Shawn and I are starting Nick on rice this upcoming week. G'ma Pam recommends it highly and bought us some, but Shawn wants to wait to start Nick on it until he's home for a 5 day stretch to watch he's reaction to it.  Tomorrow I am getting my hair trimmed! Yea!!! Miranda is going to be here at 8:45 am to watch Nick. I hope they get along ok. I love Thursday more than any other day of the week. I am on the SlimFast Diet and we ran out of milk so my shakes were made with the powder and water today. Ick! (I got milk at Cub later on) I restarted my diet Monday and have lost 2 1/2 pounds so far. Only 8-10#'s left until my pre-preg weight and only 15 #'s to my weight goal.  I can do it!  I'm giving myself until Aug. to reach my goal which is realistic, if I can just stick with it.

      I feel like I have been on a diet f o r e v e r! I am determined to lose this "baby weight" before school starts in August. I don't have too much to lose, but it is taking a long time. Nick and I have been walking like crazy! I do really well on my diet when Shawn is not here, but as soon as he gets home, something happens and I cheat. All will power is lost. Since this weekend we are going to Brooke's baby shower in the cities, I think I will be able to keep my will power up!  Nick and I had a pretty mundane Tuesday. Except for some fun for about 3 hours at G'ma Lu's house. Nick flirted so much with his grandma.  Miranda is babysitting Nick on Thursday so I can get a hair trim and highlts/low lts. YEA!!! I'm sure I'll be a nervous wreak with someone other than his grandparents watching him! I'm one of  those  mothers! Keely watched Nick a few weeks after he was born while my mom & I took a sauna less than 15 feet away and I gave her so many instructions!  Did you know that Leah can be spelled, Liya, and it's still pronounced the same as Leah...Keely told me that. I love "Liya"-it seems exotic! I am excited for tomorrow...Target shopping!  Nick did not have a good night last night due to tummy problems from watermelon that  someone  slipped him...;) But he's all better now.  I am exhausted.

      Nick discovered his reflection in the mirror at G'ma Lu's house! He would flirt with the "handsome baby" in the mirror. It was so cute. G'ma Lu was laughing like crazy and having so much fun with Nick. I took KeKe to the Hacienda Del Sol-My favorite place to eat-while my mom and Billy went to his parents to visit. Keke ordered hot chocolate and beans! ;) Yep...Beans! That's it! Awesome combination Keely! We had a blast! This afternoon was beautiful. Nick and I walked down to the lakewalk and over to 21st and back up home. It felt good to work up a sweat!

      SHAWN'S HOME! Today Mir and I attempted to walk at Brighten but it was absolutely freezing cold and it started to rain so we turned right around. At least we got out there and attempted! Shawn came home early and we went up to Target to get Brooke a baby shower present and had to get Nick a toy. Shawn picked out, "Taylor"-the turtle. Taylor makes loud funny noises and talks. At first Nick loved it, then he got shy.-being "shy" is his new thing. Now whenever we make Taylor the turtle talk Nick turns his face into a complete frown or what my G&G Koski call, "Crabby Face." It melts my heart every time and makes me laugh, too. At Target, Shawn also picked up, Along Came Polly. Nick slept this evening though out the entire movie. It is hilarious. One of my favorite parts was learning what,  sharted , means! ;) Hehehehehehe It's a good movie and I recommend it. I want to get back to Shawn and Nick now so I'll blog Sunday. Enjoy the pictures! They are from Nick's nightly bath. Shawn always captures the best pictures. He is such a super dad. Nick & I went and ordered his father's day present. It will take 2 whole weeks to get here!!!!!! That's crazy!!!!

      Today during "side-time" Nick pulled a toy to his mouth. We also played a game...I put my face close to his and he would use his fist/hand to bring my face closer to his over and over again and he would smile. I also witnessed his 1st tear.-but it wasn't a sad tear, just an eye leak type of a tear. Nick also had tummy*time today and he did good for a little while and I just gave him pretend spanks when he cried and he would stop crying. He did tummy*time for a least 10 minutes. Nick absolutely hates tummy*time. I also worked on keeping his head to the left. He even took a short nap with his head to the left! I can't believe how much Nick is changing  every  day. I almost expect him to sit up and say, "Hi Mom. Let's go for a walk!" When he was taking a nap this evening, I looked down at him and his entire face is changing. I can easily visualize what he'll look like as a little boy. He is so beautiful. The hair on his head is starting to move downward more so he no longer has a mullet. ;) He is precious. Right now he is learning about shapes from his "Baby Einstein" video. Today has flown by! Shawn might be home earlier than expected tomorrow!!!!!!!!! I hope so!!!!!! I can't wait to see him!!!!!!!!!!!!! ***Nick's Latest NickNames*** "Nickerdoddle" "My Minastroodle"  "Nickernack" of course..."Soybean"

      Well, Nick & I are back home. I was home sick. Yesterday Megan (Shawn's sister) took him to the Twins v. Mets game!!! He got home late last night and sounded like he had a blast. I have never been to an actual real professional game before, so I was really excited  for  Shawn. Nick is being an angel today-right now he's sleeping. This morning, Miranda & I met at Brighten Beach and went walking together. I am going to take Nick to the boardwalk later today, too.- If  we get bored. We still have to go to the bank later on and I haven't even showered yet. I have been busy doing laundry, dishes and taking KeKe to soccer practice. Last night went great. I didn't get scared which is impressive for me! Nick was up a lot though. I am just finishing an amazing book called,  Tuesdays with Morrie . It made me take a look at my life and what is really important. It is a true story, too! I better check on Nick...

      Yesterday was, Moving Day. Nick & I packed up some of our belongings and moved them to Grandma Lu and Billy's house for Sunday nights thru Thursday nights so Nick & I are not so lonely. We have our own room and within thirty minutes of our arrival, I had our room looking like "our room." I even have pictures up of Shawn, Nick & I and of just Nick, too.  Today Miranda(my cousin), Nick and I ran errands and went shopping. I had so much fun! Of course, Nick and I got outfits for summer which  I  desperately needed! We had a very busy day-time flew by. For dinner, Grandma Lu showed me how to make Biscuits and Sausage gravy. It is soooooooo good! This weekend I am going to make Shawn some.  I really missed Shawn today. A few times each day, an overwhelming feeling comes over me and I think there is no way I can do this-raise Nick Sunday evenings thru Thursday-without Shawn's support. I miss him so much. He is an amazing man and I am lucky to have him in my life. This time apart has really made me appreciate our relationship so in that way, distance was a good thing, but I'm ready for him to be done with his internship and home! Thank "Gosh"( G'ma Jan, that's for you;) ) we have the weekends!  Falling asleep is hard without Shawn. At least I have Nick!  Nick is getting to be so smiley lately-I LOVE IT! This morning he was laying in his pack-and-play in the sun happy as can be. No matter what I said, he would kick out his legs and smile and laugh. It was awesome! He is so beautiful. Last night-while...very early this morning we snuggled and fell asleep together.-it is such a wonderful feeling to have him all snuggled up in my arms and sleeping. It makes me want to have  more  babies!-but when we wakes up and fuses, I know I can wait ;)

      Today was the most perfect Sunday! Shawn & I ate out for breakfast. Nick even "ate" out with us-he sucked on honeydew melon, cantaloupe and a dab of strawberry juice. After that we three went to Barnes and Noble then Pam & Daryl's house for some map help for Shawn in the cities. From there we dragged our tired, hot exhausted selves to the lakewalk. It has been the most beautiful day of the year so far!  Shawn's gone back to the cities =( But Nick and I went up to Grandma Lu's and picked up Keely for the night! At Grandma Lu's, Nick got "five thousand" kisses and I got a slice of incredible apple walnut pie that Billy's brother, Mark, made. Nick feel asleep in my arms on the deck and when we all went into the house, I noticed he had blood on the back of his head!!!!! A HUGE DROP!!!!He must have got a mosquito bite. He never even cried...My Brave Boy! ;)  It has been such a great weekend with Shawn home! I can't wait until Friday night!!! Only 5 more nights and 4 1/2 more days!!!

      Shawn came home yesterday around 7pm!!! I made an incredible dinner of stuffed porkchops, wild rice, green beans & stawberry cheese cake.-Note to self, Shawn  does not  like cheese cake! ;) Shawn had to mow the lawn, but after that, we had the whole evening to ourselves. Nick crashed around 9, which was great! Today, other than Shawn needing an oil change, we have done nothing and it has been wonderful. I absolutely  love  having Shawn here. He even got up and feed Nick at 5 this morning. Right now they are both napping. I can't beleive how fast time is flying. I wish I could press a pause button.

      Nick had a fever last night of 99.5 and after a cool  bath-which he hated-and tylenol it went  up  to 99.6. Poor Nick! It finally broke around 1:45ish am. Right now he's sleeping in his vibrating chair in the bathroom. If I turn off the shower then he'll wake up, so it's still running on a cool temperature so it's not too warm in there. Last night was not a great 1st night alone with Nick! He woke up continually  all night long . But, At least he's doing fine now. I was so incredibly worried.  Shawn's coming home tonight!!! I am sooooo excited to see him. Saturday we are going to go out for breakfast!!! Yeah!!!

      Nick & I made it...We survived an entire night and day without Shawn. Whew...I was worried we wouldn't be able to make it one hour without Shawn. BUT, I MISS SHAWN SOOOOO MUCH! It was a loonnnnggggggg night without him here.  Today Grandma Lu went with me to the doctor for Nick's 1st shots. Nick was so happy  before  the shots...he was smiling like crazy and cooing. After a "head size" scare we found out Nick is in the 90% tile for height & 95% tile for weight. He is a big boy and absolutely perfect! Two nurses came into the examination room to give Nick his shots. 1 nurse held his legs while my mom & I had to hold onto Nick's arms and the second nurse gave Nick 3 shots. My mom was rubbing my back during the ordeal because I have a tendency to faint at the sight of blood and Nick did bleed...A lot! Poor Poor Poor Boy. He has been sleeping other than waking once to eat ever sense we got home. He did a great job!~Very Brave! Shawn started at PDL today!!! He gets to wear a hard hat, glasses, a PDL windbreaker, eventually stealtoe shoes, and a identification badge! His bosses took him out to Ruby Tuesday's for lunch. This internship is like an interview and Shawn will do an amazing job so it looks like we might be moving to the cities area once Shawn graduates! I'm excited. It sounds like Shawn had a pretty good 1st day. He is tired though-he has to leave Megan & Dave's house by 5:30am to get to work in the  bad  traffic.  This evening Nick and I went to Keely's soccer game and she did an incredible job! Nick slept the whole time...In fact, he's  STILL  sleeping! Hopefully he'll sleep through the night.

      Today is Shawn and my 2 year wedding anniversary. Grandma Pam watched Nick while Shawn & I brought my car to be fixed-it's not totaled-and then we went to Target and Taco John's for "Taco Tuesday" and finally home alone. I had a blast just  being  with Shawn. He is so much fun. I love his incredibly unique sense of humor. I can't believe how much I miss him right now. He left for the cities at 5. I told myself I wouldn't cry and I felt so strong up until our good~bye hug. Nick is only 10 1/2 weeks old and he can tell Dadddy's not here. After Nick's bedtime bath usually Shawn does the last feeding in our rocking chair and I gave Nick his bath and then went to feed him in the chair and he did his heartbreaking pout and cried until I got up and feed him someplace else. I am so glad Shawn will be here on the weekends and not have to work. Only 3 more days until Shawn's home!!! YEAH!!! I can't wait. My sister Keely is spending the night here tonight and tomorrow night. I am such a big baby and scared of  every  noise so it will be such a relief to have her here.-and a great distraction, too! Tomorrow is Nick's BIG Day...SHOTS! ***Don't forget Grandma Lu***If Nick's up to it, we are going to go to Keely's soccer game.  That's about it...Shawn when you read this, I LOVE YOU!!!HAPPY ANNIVERSARY HUNNY!!!

       My boy is a scucher! He can scuch his way around while doing tummy*time. He still dosen't like tummy*time, but it is helping him and he is doing much better compared to 1 month ago. We've had a busy week. Today it's raining and the candles are lit and the house has cooled off and Nick is napping! When he wakes up, we have more errands to run. Nick has done a good job sleeping the last 2 or 3 nights. He has been going to sleep at 8:30-9:00 and up at 2:30 and again around 5:30 or 6:30. After that feeding, he goes back to sleep  again  until 7:30-8:00. Last night I could not sleep, so I just watched Nick sleep. He&nbsp;is so precious! I think he is the most beautiful baby in the whole wide world!!! I love his chubby, chubby hands! Nick  loves  to stand! His face lights up and he gets this huge grin that takes up almost his entire face!~his eyes crinkle, too! I love days like today. The only thing missing to make this day perfect is Shawn. But...he'll be home in 8.5 hours!

       Yesterday I took Keke and Nick to Barnes & Noble then we three visited G&amp;G Koski then we three went home to feed  the monster  then to Chester Bowl for Music in the Park. Nick had a blast! We all did. The park was absolutely packed with families-kids, dogs and food vendors. We listened to a band called,  The Fish Heads . It's a bluegrass band. They are awesome! Nick played on my lap for an hour without fussing! He smiled, danced, and even sang! Nick Sings! He really likes looking at dogs and babies that look similar to him. It was sooooo much fun. Next Tuesday Keely and Nick and I are going back to hear Beatles music. This early afternoon Keely and I took Nick down to the lakewalk and there was a huge boat coming in. So, Keely and I walked fast and found a spot along the crowed pier. The boat blew its loud horn and I said something to Keely about I hope that doesn't hurt Nick's ears. The spot we found was not so conveniently located under the bridge so when the bridge answered the boat by whistling back, Nick cried. It was one of those scared out of his mind cries. The type that break my heart. But, it didn't last long...10 seconds maybe. I took him out of his stroller and held him as the boat went by.    Nick's weight update...19.5 pounds.

       I had the best birthday yesterday ever! It started the night before, Shawn & I went to our friends house-Mike &amp; Jess-and drank wine/beer, talked, played with puppy's and met their nephew who is 1 month younger than Nick. Speaking of Nick, he was awesome! One of the puppy's played tug-of-war with Nick's wrist rattle! Shawn and Mike drove an old truck thru 10 acres of a sort of muddy race course! The look on Shawn's face as he raced around was priceless. We all had a blast. After that, we stopped by Mount Royal Plaza and got snacks, put Nick to bed, watched a movie while eating sugar filled sticks, wax bottle candy, oreo's, and pizza rolls!!! So long diet! Nick didn't cut me any slack during the middle of the night when he was very very fussy! The morning of my b-day, Shawn & I went to brunch at Belisio's. G'ma Lu babysat Nick and was naughty!-She gave Nick a ride on her new 4-wheeler &amp; let Boyaka like Nick's face and toes. I don't trust Boyaka at all! He is still fairly young and big. Very big! Back to Belisio's....We sat outside and there was Italian music playing, the sun was shining, there was a light breeze. The food was amazing! Tusican Belgian Waffles with blueberry's! And I had a drink...or two!...of something called a Bellini. It's champagne mixed with peach puree. Perfect day. After that we went to a chocolate factory and got 3 chunks of different types of fudge. And then home. And then back to pick up Nick. And then G'pa Daryls. And then home. And then my G&G brought my present over....background...My cousin and I would buy a snapple or two or three every day last year during school mostly for what is called, Snapple facts on the cap. Yes, we are dorks! Anyway, last weekend while at Toys-r-Us, I saw a Snapple facts game!!!! My G&amp;G Koski got me that game! Last night, Shawn and I played the game for forever! It's a lot of fun...I never knew "astronauts become taller in space." Now, I am back to the same old, same old. I wish the weather would cool off a bit. I am ready for fall. Only 5 more weeks left of Shawn internship! I can't wait!!! Did I ever mention, I have the best husband ever!!!

       My poor boy is still allergic   to   cow based formula. I was at my mom's yesterday & forgot Nick's soy formula, the only thing at my mom's was his old cow based formula. So, I gave him 4 oz's of that and it didn't turn out well. When we got home, he was very clingy and cried/fussed until he finally went to sleep. This last week, Nick has not been sleeping well at night. He has been getting up 3 or more times during the night and more crabby than usual once he gets up. Nick has been doing very well at tummy time! He also will turn towards you while you are talking and really look at you. He also has fits of laughter. Today I had him propped in bed and he started laughing so hard, and so did I!&nbsp;My favorite sound in the whole wide world is Nick's laughter. &nbsp;I love him more and more everyday! Nick also  loves  to stand. And he is doing great at sitting. I am so proud of him. Shawn's coming home today!!! I can hardly wait. Only 2 more hours!!! It has been a  long  4 days without him .

       Nick got his very first hair cut from great g'ma Jan. She did a great job evening out the sides and the back of his hair. He had a huge patch of hair on one side and not the other. He fussed and cried only because we had to hold his head. Thank you G'ma Jan! Awesome job.    Today Nick and I had another 1st...we ventured to the Whole Foods Co-op and got Soy Ice Cream and teething biscuits. Nick has been teething like crazy. He was up almost all night long. I was so crabby by the time 6 rolled around and I was up. Poor Shawn-I took out my frustrations out on him because I can't take them out on Nick. I need to find a better way to vent...maybe meditaton or yoga of some sort.    It is so hot &amp; humid outside right now. I miss Shawn more than ever. I am so lonesome for my husband. I think Nick is, too. &nbsp;

      This late morning-around 10ish-Shawn, Nick & I took a long nap together. Other than the upstairs neighbors pounding, it was relaxing. Then, Shawn went to Hardee's for food while I feed Nick and now we are all watching a movie...kind of. I am finishing on the computer, Shawn put a movie in but is in Nick's room talking to Nick. Nick had fallen asleep as soon as we left Pam & Daryl's house last night around 7:30-8 and slept until I gave him 4 ozs at 11 then got up for good at 3:30. I tried to get him to go back to bed but handed him off to Super Dad who stayed up with Nick and attempted everything in the book to get Nick back to bed.  This lasted 2 hours !~While I slept! So those two needed a nap more than I did. Most Sundays we all are running around trying to get this and that done all day, but today, we are staying in! Nick slept on his left side last night yet again.-But he napped on his right. I think that's ok because if he spends all his time on his left, we are going to have a left side problem then. Shawn and Nick did great yesterday! (While I was at work) Those two bond instantly and for the entire Saturday. Next Saturday the three of us are going to Charlie & Amanda's house.

      I gave Nick a bath, bottle with 8oz's of formula, and put him to bed only...He wasn't tired! His hands were so busy, I couldn't help but smile. Nick is such a cutie! This afternoon he held his bottle all by himself for  20  seconds!!! Last night he slept on his left side again and today when ever he played with all his toys in his crib, he looked straight up or to the left. I can't believe how much I love him! Nick is so amazing. I can hardly wait to crawl into bed and snuggle! He still sleeps in his co-sleeper for 1/2 the night and the other half in my and Shawns bed. G'pa Daryl watched Nick his late afternoon while Shawn & I went to see Fahrenheit 9/11.~my 2nd time seeing it. I loved that movie more the second time than the first. I got to enjoy seeing more details with time around that I missed before. There is no way that Bush will be reelected another term. Bush is actually coming to Duluth on Tuesday. I'm sure my aunt, Katie, will be protesting him! This weekend, I think Shawn & I ought to start looking for a larger car seat for Nick. He is 18+ pounds now and only getting bigger...Not fatter G'ma Lu! I'm pretty sure his seat only goes up to 20 pounds. Work again tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it and at the same time, not looking forward to leaving Nick & Shawn. =( I really missed them both last Saturday and called almost every hour! I got 1 of my sister's poems' published! It's titled, Writing Prompt #8. The first few times I read it, it moved me to tears. I attempted to read it to my mom, but couldn't finish because I was crying! My sister, Keely, is an amazing writer.

      Thank you G'ma Lu for the exersaucer! Nick loves it! Yesterday when I was dressing Nick to go see G'ma Lu at work, he took that moment to pee all over my bed... my bed ! So, I was forced to do laundry yesterday. Yesterday went by surprisingly fast. Before I knew it, I was putting Nick to bed. Today is a big birthday party at my grandparents for my aunt-Sheri and uncle-Mike from Florida. Their family comes up every year and we celebrate their birthdays while they are in Duluth. I have no idea what Nick should wear ;)  More laundry to do today and I feel guity for not taking Nick on a walk for such a long time. Although, he doesn't even really  know  we are on a walk because he crashes into a very deep deep sleep as soon as we start our walk. But, either way, we are going on a walk. It looks beautiful out. Nick sleept on his  left  side last night and right now I used Pam and Daryls's advice about a rolled up blanket and it's working! Yea! I hope it's not too late.

      Nick has become the ultimate wiggle worm! He can quickly wiggle himself off his vibrating chair, his car seat, even if you set him on your legs...anywhere and everywhere. He's has also been much more expressive the last few days with his voice  and  he's ticklish! G'ma Lu discovered this one. I tried it once this morning...ok, twice...and he squishes up his face and laughs! It is so funny to watch.  Nick has got much better at putting his fist in his mouth and anything else he can grab! G'ma Lu & Billy are getting Nick an excersaucer! "To support Christian's weight loss." My mom usually calls Nick, Christian. Hopefully today or tomorrow we can get that because both Nick & I are so bored...It's going to be a very very long day. Duluth is cloudy and today is supposed to resemble yesterday which means periods of rain here and there all day long. And it's cool out, which is fine by me!

      Nick is a daddy's boy!!!~all weekend long Nick was only truly happy when he was in Shawn's arms  or  in Shawn's presence. I love it! I'm so glad they bonded so well this weekend. I don't think they have  ever  been as close as they are now. It's so cute.  We both miss Shawn right now. Keely's sleeping over tonight! Nick and Keely get along really well. She's entertaining him right now. Tomorrow Keely & I are finally going to see, Fahrenheit 9/11. I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since it came out. I can't wait! Both Keely & I are huge Kerry supporters and we both want Bush out of office  4 years ago !

      I loved being at work. It was so weird at first because my fingers knew what to do on the keyboard faster than my head knew what to do! I brought tons of pictures of Nick and showed everyone. There were a lot of babies there and I kept trying to guess how old they were according to Nick's size and  every  time I was wrong. Nick is  really really  big for his age. All the babies that were his size were at least 11-12 months old! I missed both Shawn & Nick like crazy, but it was good to be around people and to do work that I knew I could not screw up. Whenever I am taking care of Nick, I hardley ever know for sure what he wants or if I am doing things right. I am looking forward to him telling me & Shawn what is wrong or right or what he wants. I called G'ma Lu and before I dialed, I told Nick who we were calling. When the message beeped, I told Nick to talk to G'ma Lu...And he did! He cooed and talked for 40 seconds or so. Smart Boy! Last night Shawn, Nick & I went up to the Kallevigs for dinner on the grill. It was fun. We watched, Under the Tuscan Sun. I liked that movie. I want to go to Tuscany! Shawn and Nick hung out the whole evening, too. What a  super dad ! Today Shawn & Dave (future brother-in-law) are going shotting. I have no idea what Nick and I are going to do yet. Something fun!

      ...Nick rolled over from his side to his stomach! Also, while on his stomach, he wiggled his way over until his head was touching my head! He wiggled at least 2 feet over!  What a Boy !!!!!!!!!!

      Yesterday Nick and I drove down to Roseville to spend the night at a hotel for Shawn's birthday. Map Quest gave out the wrong directions and both Shawn and I got lost on the way to the hotel! It is so frustrating to be lost, tired, very hot and hungry! Nick slept the  whole  way down there including getting lost and stopping for directions. Megan came to the hotel and she & Dave watched Nick for the entire evening so Shawn and I could go out to dinner and have alone time. Yea Megan! Super Aunt! Thank you so much!!! Shawn and I had a blast. Nick slept thru the night! I finally picked up that when Shawn is home, Nick sleeps all night long. During the week, Nick gets up around 2-3ish and again at 4-6ish.  Nick & I left the cities area at 5:30am. After I fed him at 5, I knew he wasen't going to be going back to sleep any time soon and I didn't want to be stuck in the room waiting until the next feeding so we could leave.  The drive was long. I was so tired. But Nick & I took a nap once we got home and Nick & Shawn took a nap when Shawn got home =) Sleepy boy. He's wide awake and happy now. Tomorrow, back to work.

       Nick is doing an amazing job at sitting up. He does great sitting in his boppy chair. Now when I have Nick wrap his fingers around my hand to pull up into a sitting position he automatically pulls  himself  into a standing position! Strong boy. 99% Boy!      Great News...Because of the fact we only need a babysitter a few hours 3 days per week...G'ma Pam offered to help out for this upcoming semester!!! I can't begin to describe how grateful I am! I like that Nick will have one-on-one care and she is already aware of all his quirks...like facing to the rightside which is not good. Also, Nick can be very demanding. He is a high energy boy that likes to be busy with someone 20 out of 24 hours per day. Shawn and I think daycare will be a great option for Nick ...when he is a bit older. Maybe starting this winter. I think the interaction Nick will get at daycare will be a great thing, but right now, he is still too young and needs so much from the person watching him. We three are lucky to have another option-Pam.           Tonight, I am going to put Nick to bed in his very own crib. This is a big step for both of us. Last night he kicked me all night long in the stomach. Like I wrote before, Nick is a strong boy. Ahhhhhhhhh! Poor stomach. I woke Shawn up around 4am to switch spots so I could relax my stomach for a few hours. Nick is doing great with Oatmeal cereal. No other solids will be started until he is 6 months old per the Doctor. He loves when it's cereal time.       Th  is afternoon Nick and I hung out at G'ma Lu's. There was a number of people either still there or they arrived early this morning. Nick played with everyone while G'ma Lu opened presents. Nick was exhausted by the time we left. He fell asleep in the carrier. He loves it at G'ma Lu's house. There is almost always lots of people for Nick to watch. He has started to "talk" much more often. Mostly when he is frustrated!

       All of a sudden my blog works....After I just typed my entire  long  entry under the photo caption....This is crazy! I worked on getting into my blog for about 45 minutes before giving up and using the photo route to post an entry and now...my blog works. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh! How frustrating! It is time for bed...Last night I ended up only getting 2 hours and 20 minutes of sleep. Between Shawn and Nick sprawling out, I don't have any room in my bed! It is getting to be time to move Nick into his perfectly fine and close crib  or  get a much  bigger  bed!

       urlLink    Nick first CuP~aDvEnTuRe! Nick drank water from his very own brand new cup this evening and he gulped it right down. I thought it might be time to introduce his cup when he grabbed MY water glass and drank from it without spilling....Yes, You read me right...without spilling!!! He is awesome. Very Very early this morning I dropped Nick off at G'pa/ma Kal's house for the entire day while both Shawn and I worked. Nick had a great time, especially napping with G'pa Daryl on the floor. At 4:00ish Nick and I headed up to the Taylor/Johnsons....NOW the Johnson's for G'ma Lu's (Wu's) wedding to Billy. It rained but Nick liked it at first. He decided to talk right at the begining of the ceremony, so we had to move even farther back. I did get to see the very very end when Billy and G'ma Lu were pronounced Husband and Wife and they high fived instead of kissing. It was a great wedding! There was a lot of people there including a baby 3 wks older than Nick named, Alexandra. My mom looked absolutely beautiful in her hawaiian print shirt and shorts! She glowed! It's still raining and late last night I fixed my blog only to discover now it's broken AGAIN! Friday on the way back from the cities, Shawn got into a car accident...a bad car accident. He was being a careful driver staying 3 car lengths ahead of the other cars due to the stop and go traffic...all of a sudden the car ahead of Shawn slammed on their brakes. Because Shawn was 3 car lengths back, he was able to stop his truck before hitting the car ahead of him, BUT the car behind Shawn wasen't looking and slammed into Shawn sending him flying into the air and into a ditch. Shawn banged his head, but managed after filing a police report to drive all the way home. Dizzy. Tired. Sore. My Poor POOR husband. He is doing ok today. Right now he is actully sleeping. I can't imagine life without Shawn. There would be no life...it is inconsivible. He is the best husband & father. There is No One else like him. I am lucky. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is an old picture but one of my favorites. I miss my angel...he is being a little devil today! The only way as of right now that I can post onto my blog is thru pictures. I met Nick's future daycare family today. I am so nervous. My stomach is all twisted up in knots. They have 6-8 kids and there will be another child Nick's age and one other that is almost 1 year old. Plus older kids that are pre-school age. I don't know...that seems like a lot of kids to me. I can't imagine another Nick to watch at the same time. Hummmm. Can I just quit school and stay at home for the rest of my life and never leave Nick's side...ever...I don't think Shawn will go for that! ;) I like Kelly a lot. That is his future daycare-mom. It's probably a good thing for Nick to interact with kids. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! I don't know how I am going to drop Nick off and walk away....I'll probably end up in tears the first 2 weeks I leave...who am I kidding....the first year! Nick will probably love it there and be just fine. I love Nick so much. He's my Nicky-pie. &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Wednesday was Nick's 4 month shots appointment, but before I get to that...I haven't been able to log into my blog for some reason so I am attempting to fix that. Wednesday I took Nick to a park for the 1st time and he fell asleep in the swing! How cute. Nick has discovered his love for books! He loves to eat anything and everything he can get his quick little hands on! Especially if it's in your hands! Back to the Dr Appt...Nick is in the 99% for height, 98% for weight and 97% for head....SO to all who have teased Nick for being overly plump...Mom and Keely...Ha! He's on the more skinny side of being porportionate. ;) The shots went well. Nick cried but as soon as they were over, he stopped crying.-Because I gave him a bottle with sugar water right before and after the shots. He was very sleepy all Wednesday and Wed night into Thursday. &nbsp; urlLink

       This morning Shawn and I dropped Nick off at G'ma Pam and G'pa Daryl's house. Shawn and I hurried home for a relaxing Sunday like we used to have B.N. (Before Nick) It was great! We borrowed a few movies, I read a bit, laid in bed and basiclly did nothing which was perfect! For a few minutes, I forgot about Nick...then I remembered...then I felt like a horrible mother for forgetting...then I wondered what Nick was doing right then...then I missed Nick sooooooo much. I couldn't wait to go and get him so I could hold him, smell him, kiss him and hug Nick! He had a good time at his G'ma/pa's house. He slept for most of his stay. Yesterday, after work, Shawn, Nick and I went up to Mike and Jess's house. Nick was more his usual self up there compared to last weekend-last Saturday he was an angel! Shawn and I had so much fun! We ate, drank, talked, played with the cutest puppies ever again, and rode in the field! Great Saturday!   I am absolutely exhausted. It has been way too hot. Rain tomorrow!
