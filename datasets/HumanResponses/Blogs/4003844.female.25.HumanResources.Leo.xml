      I feel like crap today. But you know what? I don't care! I have shit to do. So, anyway, this morning I dropped the jeep off to get Rhino lined. Which means that even if it rains the inside should never stink like rotting dead things again. Good deal. I hate that nasty smell. So, anyway, I feel like shit. More later.

      Finally  urlLink Friday ! I thought the week was  never going to end ! Not that it hasn't been a semi-decent week but I'm so ready to relax. Okay, so first of all let me re-iterate that I have no idea what the hell my problem was this week. I find myself stressing out over   NOTHING  . Well, maybe not nothing, but things that usually wouldn't get me all worked up. I went and had my hair done yesterday at   Gino Venti's  . I'd have to say that Gino's is by far the best salon that I've ever been to. And Gino is just great. Every time I go I have to have him. Nothing like a strong  urlLink Italian  guy washing your hair! I think it has more to do with the strength of a man's hands really than it does him being Italian, or even attractive for that matter. Gino, if you ever read this (which you won't because you have better things to do with your life than read my pathetic carap), I don't think you're ugly so don't get all butt hurt. There,  six covered . But I think I am safe in assuming that he knows what he is doing.My hair always looks great when I walk out of there. Unlike   Chicky   at the last salon I went to who made me look like  urlLink Ronald McDonald . The worst part was that she made out like it was the Taj Mahal of hair stying. Too funny. And really annoying when I actually saw it outside in the daylight Eeeuck.  I am about to become the ultimate diet Nazi. I saw some pictures of myself and to be honest I really hated them. It's not that I don't like myself as a person, it's just that I   cannot stand   being overweight. It seriously depresses the  urlLink shit  out of me. I like taking care of myself, I like looking good and being well dressed. I think that I should go with the course of action listed in the Phys Fitness MCI. Sounds good to me. I am working on quitting smoking. I have seriously cut back. I just don't want to be 40 looking 80, plus it was making me feel like shit in the morning. I am going to go get my teeth bleached after I quit completely. (*  quitting plan not in effect from 05-00 hours beginning today, Friday the 13th. It is after all,  Martini Friday !Cheerth!)  In other news, the cat has not pissed on me once in the last week. Yay! MGySgt Dave (MrApathy78) has reappeared on the scene as confirmed by unit J-9 in a frantic early morning phone call from across the Pacific. A certain someone tried to tell him that I was MIA as always. Go figure. You know, sometimes I'm not sure if she's trying to protect  me from them or them from me . Funny how people from the past are finding me lately. Well, the morning has been relatively tame so far. I am about to immerse myself in reports, maybe I'll dazzle you with more of my sparkling wit and the mundane details of my life when I surface for air. I know you can't wait.

      I think I found my new favorite drink from (where else)...  Starbucks ! I typically either go with a plain black coffee or hot soy Chai, size Grande of course. This morning some wierd worm crawled up my ass so I ordered a soy Chai with a shot of espresso. Good shit. Got an interesting look from the chick at the counter though..... So, I'd say it was a pretty rough day yesterday. I have idea what the hell my problem is, I was all emotional like a little girl. I think that it's just being unsure of things. It's like everything is so up in the air. I know what I am doing with myself but I have no idea what is going on with anything else. And I'm not trying to hurt anyone's feelings but I am kind of keeping to myself because I don't feel like dealing with any more crap. It's already a shitstorm here!  I think what I need is a good cry. Yes, you heard me. A good cry. Some comfort. Sounds strange but doesn't everybody just need to be comforted once in awhile? I don't know, I'm hormonal or something. Being a chick sucks. Yeah the perfumes and lotions and purses and shoes, etc, are neat but overall I'd have to rate the experience like a 2. If you are too strong you are a bitch, you know. There's no "oh, she's a strong woman" about it. You are a   BITCH  , perhaps even a stupid    CUNT   . And men have a hard time dealing with it. It scares them away. Or if they are insecure they think you don't need them.  I mean, I'm not overbearing or anything but I feel that each person is responsible for carrying their own weight in a relationship or otherwise in life. I feel that if a person is willing to be given to then they should care enough to want give back. And not monetarily. Fuck money! I'd rather be wearing trash bags living out of a busted wheel shopping cart happily, than carrying out a padded but miserable life.  I live my life passionately. I can't help it. It is who I am and who I will always be. I don't need drama. I don't need baggage, problems, or issues. I try not to let my past interfere with my future. And believe me my past has blown like Moby Dick. It would be easy to wallow in it but I choose not to. I will live my life, I will love even though I've been hurt. And yes, I have been deeply hurt in the past but that's not going to stop me.  I have never found anyone that I truly loved that wasn't afraid to love me back. I mean no-holds-barred god damn I would walk across hot coals for you if you asked. Because that's how I am, and that is what love means to me. I am not asking to be worshipped or adored. I would happily compromise for true love. It's when I compromise and it turns out to that the other person was only thinking of their own welfare that really pisses me off. It makes me feel used. I'm not a trophy. I'm not a diversion. I don't need all your attention constantly but I won't warm the bench forever. I need to be put in the game once in awhile. I will tell you that I can't stand to be toyed with. I'm very black or white. Either you like me or you don't. And if you don't  fuck you ! Chances are I don't like you either.  I am not a person who will "grow on you". I'm not a friggen wisteria for Christ sakes. What you see is what you get!    I'm not perfect, I never claimed to be, and most likely I  never will be . Deal with it or don't.    Whew, I feel better........

      Wednesday. Payroll day. It's like a speedbump in the middle of the week. You're almost to the blessed weekend but nooot quite.... It's like a mirage in the middle of the Sahara! Just far enough away to piss you off when you really think about it. So, I really don't know what the hell my malfunction is today. I have THE WORLD'S WORST HEADACHE, and my sinuses feel like they have rubber cement in them. I got caught lounging in my crappy work chair with my head hung over the back just staring at the ceiling. You know, before I would have cared what the people that I work with thought. Lately, however, I don't really care what anyone thinks. I am tired of caring what people think, which is absolutely dangerous! Seriously, I feel like Jim Carrey at his most out of control. Think Liar Liar. Anyhow, I hope that the powers that be are merciful and let this day go by as quickly as possible, not just for my sake but for that of the general public.... Prozac anyone?

      Okay, so as part of my morning ritual I get on the net and check out what's going on in our wonderful world. I troll the likes of CNN and MSNBC looking for anything even remotely relevant. Relevant to what I have no idea. Anyhow, I just want to take this opportunity to ask  WHAT THE FUCK ? What in the hell are some people thinking? Case in point:    - A dispute over clothes and a video game system between a young woman and a squatter in her grandparents' house apparently sparked the vicious beating and stabbing murders of six people whose bodies were found late last week in a blood-spattered home, police said.       Ok! So six people were viciously murdered over a god damn  X-Box ? Apparently soome of the victims were so badly beaten that dental records were useless to identify them.      How about this one:          -  A love-struck young man threw himself off his balcony Monday, two days after a quarrel prompted his girlfriend -- a member of Greece's Olympic judo team -- to jump from the same spot.             Wait, it gets better :           -Giorgos Chrisostomides, 24, was on life-support at an Athens hospital with injuries to his head and back. His high-school sweetheart, 20-year-old judo champion Eleni Ioannou, was   at another hospital in critical condition   with multiple fractures to her head and  body    .   "It started about who would play solitaire on the computer."       So this guy jumps off a balcony after his girlfriend decides that if she can't play solitaire she better take her own life. Sounds like these two were a few nuts short of a brownie.  People just blow me away. Maybe my life isn't really all that bad.

         Theodore Roosevelt travelled West to overcome the sorrow of losing his wife and mother, who both died on the same day. After their deaths, Roosevelt spent two years on his ranch in the Badlands of Dakota Territory riding, driving cattle and hunting  before  he went on to become one of the most important figures of the 20th century. Throughout the remainder of his life in times of stress and trial, Roosevelt returned to his wanderings for solace.

      Monday Monday Monday! My favorite day! If I wasn't concentrating on typing this I would be sitting here bobbing for cock~ The damn cat started to meow as soon as I got home last night and didn't stop ALL FRIGGEN NIGHT. I have no idea what his problem is!! Why can't he just act like a cat and lay around, eat, drink, and take a piss where he's supposed to? What is so difficult about that? He needs some how-to-be-a-cat lessons.  Kitty Boot Camp .  LOOK AND ACT LIKE A REAL CAT IN 7 DAYS ! Show him some cat propaganda like Tom and Jerry cartoons, maybe make him play with those cute yet annoying catnip toys. I don't know. Anyhoo, it was a good weekend! A lot of things to talk about later. =) How about never settle for cheap coffee? Wal-Mart is a great place to hang out at 1:30 a.m.(in my expert opinion). I have a sneaking suspicion that you know what I mean.
