      I'm not a start. There is no halo over my head. Fate doesn't like the color of my eyes. Struggle and strife are old friends of mine. Who am I ? I am survival.  I am guts.  I am pride. I like odds. Especially when they're stacked against me. Because there will come a time when I'll stare them in the eye. And smile the smile of  the one who's pulled it off.  I am the boy who will have deep lines on his face someday. And it'll make me look a greek god when I laugh... Because that is the day, I will fear no fear. And taste sweat that is sweet. And look back for the very first time and say, I did it my way. The long hard way!

      Naive is hoping for impossibilities. Selfishness request for more. Stupidity makes yourselves look silly. Stubbornness refuses to accept the reality. Complacency limits yourself from improvement. Foolishness brings shame.  Realistic bored your partner. Manliness shows no interested.  Feminine shower with care n concern. maturity gains the fame. Childish bears the consequences. Love is special but isn't magnificent and lead you nowhere. Is there something call Everlasting? Neverending? Forever or even Eternity? I doubt. Prove everything to me. Everything will end after you met enough people.

      Experience can prevent you from making mistakes but still cannot escape from heartbroken state. Abide by the choice made by stubbornness. Abandan everything with courage. Stand guard against everypassby chances. Regardless good or bad and assume everything is here to destroy n hurt you.Driven to madness by love.  When will i grow up? How long must i remain as a kid? the rising sun is forcing me to move on. Where did i come from? Where should i proceed to? Where is safe for me? Insecurity is how i feel. Everybody had put on a poker face. What is real; what is fake? I don't know. I can only stay calm and analyse every single person. Not to let my guards down. Judges are unbelievable. DO humans know that people around are putting on a facad? Or have they realise and refuse to believe that they are? Or are they simple n pure? Are their sympathy real or are they there to mislead you n get you hurt again? Complex - a set of prepressed emotions and ideas which affext a person's behaviour; an exaggerated reaction(to something). I had enough of thepeople who hides their true evil self. Show yourself! Stop it! I had seen lots of fabrications. Convinced that that humans learn to protect themselves. Kind hearted is not my personality. Hatred in me cause me to lose myself again. Learned that standing in the crowd will only endangered myself but i chose to hide inside. The philosophies of human nature is profound. Ridiculous contradictions only put yourself into more confuse mindset.

      Living in this world got so many things to be proven. Trying so hard to be accepted by this world. Yet there isn't much more chances to prove than to escape and retaliate against reality.  Surviving is just having basic food n water. True knowledge of life is about searching, understanding, thinking and changing -nothing to worry about.  Serious as it may be and simple as it may be while complex as it can beyond imagination- Descriptions of life expressions are golden. Thats why i am honoured to write it down. How i wish to express it with music n words. Thats is what i always been wanting.

      Asking for love, face the consequences. Yearning for recovery, yet remain in painful memories. Try to be cheerful but still cannot escape rom past things. Some are sad while others are confuse. Melancholy romance is the most painful thing. So much different types of love. Family, Friends, Relationship, Teacher n student, i been focusing so much on Relationship n neglecting the presence other love.  Thus Everthing will be lost when u lose ur only love.

      Over the years i have changed and shaped myself to be accepted into society with open arms but where i have gained acceptance i have lost acceptance too i lost the ability to accept myself for who i am now no longer pure, innocent and trusthworthy i have shaped myself to always think about how i could benefit people's cries are but silence if i stand to gain. But the only consolation is you i have regained back some of my innocence all these i've learned from loving you you accepted me for all the flaws i possess and for all evils and mistakes i did you have made me learned to accept myself again and for that i thank you my angel my angel who came in these dark times and brought me to light

      I buried my head against the pillow hoping with the little will power i have, i could bury my head in forever to escape from reality the ugly side of me. But then i heard someone calling was it you who had come to take me away but alas.. it was silence which took your place hopeless but hoping i buried myself again waiting for you to take me home again waiting for love to bring me to flight again wating for you to set things right again but then you made me lose my faith again..

Back From the date..   Am back home after what seems like a long long day.. sitting here writing this while waiting for Ben to give me a gd nite msg or call.. hehe.. went to meet ben and mei lian today.. things started out sweetly until a string of disagreements came and totally just spoiled my mood..   I  am not the sort of person who will get so worked up over a particular matter right there and then.. most of the time i would just sit back and relax.. just like the time at chen hui's house when scott that bloody bastard bitched me.. i was all composed and stuff... but with ben i am completely caring so much that i would get worked up over any small things.. gosh.. it is not that i am possesive or something.. maybe i am but i just dont wanna lose the best thing that ever happened to my life you geddit.. but i dunno if he does understand the extend of how i actually feel for him.. haha.. his  love  is addictive.. it makes me feel like i'm on top of the world one moment and the next moment i could be jumping all about blowing kisses into empty space without the need to feel embarrased. i could also be crying out loud screaming out all the hurt that he caused me in the middke of a busy street without carin that anyone is lookin.. haha.. no wonder they say love is a drug.. Todays arguments shook me pretty badly.. i am not the sort who will feel sorry for anything i do but  ben  made me feel pretty guilty bout stuff i've said..  But on the way home alone i messaged him and told him how i felt and he told me in one sweet msg " you cant lose me silly baby.. u cant anyway.. cause i'll stick to u like glue.. " haha.. that msg made me so happy.. more then he realised.. it made everything felt like it is back in place and i am once again reassured.. got home with a much better mood and ate the stuff dad cooked.. he is improving i must say.. i support his idea of opening a shop all the way.. hehe..   look at this post for a hidden msg...      fullerton hotel! luv tt place

						   Time: 1:06pm    date:12 june The Beginning of a new diary.. ah.. so excited! this is my first time trying to put together a website so i am not exactly a pro at this but up till now.. i am still basically quite pleased with the results.. hehe.. well.. i am just a normal 16 yr old guy.. nothing special about me.. i am a guy who is on a constant search for love..  Have i found it? well.. i think so.. or should i say that i am confident that i have found it already? cause that is really what i think i've found.. my soul mate.. some people could have hundreds of lovers.. found someone they are happy with and get hitched.. but they would never find their soul mate.. to find a soul mate is to find someone whom u can look past their physical appearance and be so totally into him/her even if he was the ugliest guy/gal on earth. to find your soul mate is to find someone who can make you give up everything to be woth the person and you feel this deep connection with them that u cant explain..  Some people might disagree with how i describe the term soul mate but for me.. that is what it means. I am proud to say that i am the luckiest bastard on earth!! haha... cause i've already found my soulmate.. lets just call this mysterious soul mate who wants to remain elusive BB yea? haha(err... BB stands for bao bei... hehe) well.. am not going to write anymore.. gotta go complete my site! andrew signing off!     haha.. a pic of me when i was modelin for a new urban male thingy      haha.. me smokin with my friend in our school uniform..

						   Boring day at school.. bloody weather.. was hot as hell then cold as winter in the next sec.. enjoyed the cold parts though.. went to school as usual.. spent the whole day slacking in class.. hmm.. not sure whats up with liao fan.. came here and gave me some bloody attitude.. sheesh.. if i'm not in a gd mood i would have given him one punch on the face.. went to meet ben after school and spent the first part cuddling.. then went to causeway point to watch mean girls.. aww.. such a cool show.. it was totally hilarious.. laughed so much i was shaking.. the movie sorta reminded me of myself 1 year back actually.. when i was pretty mean to everybody and treated everyone like some slave or something.. but strangely everyone seemed to listen to me last time.. it was almost like they were afraid of me or something.. well.. actually i know why they are afraid of me.. i mean.. its almost like i am wearing a billboard saying "offend me and i'll make life sucky for u".. especially since all my friends are like that too.. hmm.. so took the bus home with ben and ended the day with a nice phone call to say gd nite.. oh well.. am sleepy now... gonna go to bed..
