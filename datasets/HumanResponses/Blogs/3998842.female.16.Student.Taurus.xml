       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  My Commandment  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  &nbsp;  You'll keep your distance   Holding back tears   Inside you're dying   Murdered by fear  Though I have left you   Alone in the dust   Battered and broken   Unable to trust  ~  &nbsp;  You'll keep your distance   Drowning in tears   I'll give my commandment:   Thou shall not heal  ~  &nbsp;  The day burns down on you   Your eyes are red   You can't sleep at night   My scent fills your bed  Although you insist   On saving face   You're lonely and longing   Lost, out of place  ~  &nbsp;  But you'll keep your distance   Drowning in your tears   I'll give my commandment:   Thou shall not heal  ~  &nbsp;  You don't want to want me   You don't want to lie   Keep faking you smiles   Every time she walks by  You can't decide again   Between fallacy and truth   I know it hurts now   That I'm fine without you  ~  &nbsp;  But maintain your resistance   Drowning in blood and tears   I've given my commandment:   Thou shall not heal~  Maintain futile resistance   Drowned in your blood and tears   I've given my commandment:   Thou shall not heal~     You'll never heal    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  ~fin~

       ~~~~~~~~~  Number 45  ~~~~~~~~~  &nbsp;  So you'll push me away   I'll wait behind the line   So you don't swing that way   Good luck living your lie   I wish you all the best of luck   With your new life, new friends, new guy   I can be happy now   Now you've told me why   But how dare you sayI'll soon forget   How dare you speak with such regret   I'm sorry I wasn't there enough   Sorry I can't be your best friend   I'm sorry that now you think   Our friendship has to end   I know that you warned me   But you have to know   It may take me a while   To learn to let go   If and when you want friendship   I'll be waiting for you here   Teaching myself how to let go   Learning not to feel tears   Only one more thing to say   With meaningful words and cheap, pointless rhymes   Forget about our romance   But remember our good times   Remember the fountain   And dancing in the rain   Remember the kisses   All the pleasure, the pain   Remember us burning   That book in the snow   Give me back your friendship   And I'll let you go.    &nbsp;  ~fin~    &nbsp;

       ~~~~~~~~~~~  Reminiscence  ~~~~~~~~~~~  &nbsp;  I miss you more than I want to   I miss you more than I should   I miss the way you held me   Until the morning came   I miss the way I used to hear   "I love you" everyday   I miss the way we used to act,   The people we made mad   I miss the way we used to talk   About the times we've had   I miss the way we used to kiss   The tender, playful bite   I&nbsp;miss the way we said goodbye   The same way every night   There's nothing like being in your arms   The love, the comfortable security   And yet I know that in your heart   There's nothing left for me   So I turn on my blacklight   Wishing it were Christmas blue   And cry listening to the songs   Most reminiscent of you   But where I used to taste the love   The comfort for my fears   Lying here in bed alone   All I taste are tears.    &nbsp;  ~fin~

       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Mon Vampire Charmant   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    &nbsp;  Sharp pain   Dull ache   Stainless steel and flesh   Brought together by an addiction   An ardeur that must be fed   A bloodlust that pushes   To the brink of insanity   And far beyond   Feel it flow   Feel my life   Flow from my veins   To your lips   Savor each drop you can manage   For it will soon be gone   You must not let them see   You must hide your weakness   For it is not brought by pain   Or damaging words   It continues now   Simply because   It always has been   And always will be   It fills the void   That emptiness inside   Left alone,   It will consume you from within   Dissolve your mind   Your heart, your soul   Until all that remains   Is your beautiful shell   And your bloodlust   It is all that drives you   And as your lips press softly   To my scarred and bleeding wrists   My soul is healed   And I have the love   Of mon vampire charmant   Once again, and always.    &nbsp;  ~fin~

       ~~~~~~   Unclean    ~~~~~~ &nbsp;  One night of lust  One night of sin  Don’t make me hate you  Give up, give in  Knew it meant nothing  The one night I gave you  Finally chased by delivering day  Never my lover  Always my friend  Never allowed  To touch me again  Won’t you stop staring?  Keep your hands off me  Get out of my head, bitch  Let go, make me free  You know I don’t love you  You know it won’t last.  I let you touch me  I think I need a bath.    &nbsp;  ~fin~

       ~~~~~   Whore   ~~~~~    It’s begun already, too late to turn back,  Whatever you do, don’t let go.  Need someone to touch me, let me feel,  Whatever you do, don’t leave me alone.  &nbsp;  Felt your skin and saw his eyes,  Whatever you do, don’t stop.  Knew my heart died and wished it was him,  Whatever you do, don’t let me fall.  &nbsp;  Saw you breathing again, salt on your skin,  Whatever you do, don’t speak.  Felt you relax, wishing for love,  Whatever you do, don’t look at me.  &nbsp;  Your eyes finally closed, dreaming of me,  Whatever you do, don’t ask me to stay.  Stand beneath the hot water, trying to make myself clean,  Whatever you do, just go away.    &nbsp;  ~fin~

       ~~~~~~~   Request   ~~~~~~~    &nbsp;  I gave you what you wanted  Let you give in to your lust  Revealed your dark side by candle light  As you fell to emotions you shouldn’t trust.  &nbsp;  Opened your eyes in a darkened room  You melted into my sweet embrace  Felt your eyes try to open me  Myself reflected in your face.  &nbsp;  Took the last of your innocence  Made you mine for one night  Let myself fall into the darkness  Abandoned truth and right  &nbsp;  Tasting sweet, seductive sin  Knowing it was wrong  Words whispered in the hot, flickering light  Should be forgotten by the dawn.  &nbsp;  My tongue felt your sweet crimson life  My fingers felt your heat  Fed my ardeur from deep within  Conscience lay dying in defeat  &nbsp;  Never kept against your will  Not becoming a slave in my bed  My heart is mine, and mine alone.  You can have my body instead.    &nbsp;  ~fin~    &nbsp;  A/N: Request, Tonight, Unclean, and Whore all refer to a friend I slept with who just happened to be my ex-boyfriend's sister.&nbsp; Oops.&nbsp; We're still good friends.&nbsp; All three of us.&nbsp; I have no idea why I wrote so much about one rather meaningless night...

Yet all that she sees and all that she will  are roses for Ari of soft snow white silk.  ~fin~

        ~~~~~~  Apathy  ~~~~~~      Walk through life in a daze.  Trying to pry myself  out.  Out of a bloody existence.  I’m living in my past.  In hers.  Can’t let go.  Why can’t you just leave me alone?  Just get out.  You linger longer than asked.  Your presence hangs about me.  A no longer sweet aroma.  Spoiled.  Insipid.  You’re no longer welcome.  Tore me up.  Ripped.  Walked away.  But refuse to leave.  You cannot.  You will not.  Played your games and  lost.  Lost more than I thought  I possessed to lose.  Get away.  Stay away.  You’re filthy.  Hands tainted with  My own blood  reach out to caress me.  I run but you follow.  Why are you still running after me  you’ve asked before.  Still puzzled.  Still chasing.  Scratching and clawing.  Reopening my wounds.  My back, my throat.  Most vulnerable.  Torn like a whipping boy.  But now there’s someone  to lick my wounds for me.  Don’t want me healed?  Then you shouldn’t have left.  Keep your regrets to yourself.  I’ve got my own past to burn.  My own secrets to keep.  My own interests to protect,  to protect me.  So just stay away.  Don’t call.  Don’t write.  Speak every now and then.  Let me know you’re alive.  But don’t tell me how you’re feeling.  Don’t tell me how you’ve been.  Don’t tell me you miss me.  Don’t talk about our past.  If you refuse,  Then don’t talk to me at all.  It’s not that I really hate you.  It’s just that I don’t care.    &nbsp;  ~fin~

       In   love Not with you not with her. With a memory. With an image. With an evening. Touch me remind me design me. Mold me into anything. Whatever will make you happy, honey. Call me sweetheart. Hold me through the night I’ll stare into the Blue lights and pray for eternity. In love Not with you not with her. With a kiss. With a touch. With a scream. Too quiet. Too out. Too much to handle. I’m sorry, baby You’ll say. I just don’t need you anymore. You’re body, it just don’t work for me no more. A kiss. One last kiss. A ring returned by a reluctant friend. Tears on pavement. Can’t live without you. Don’t leave me. A call. A truth. A lie. I’m sorry, baby You’ll say. I’m sorry. I’ll beg. ~ In love Not with you not with her. With the rain With the pain With the complication. Only happy when it rains, it’s not you I want. I’m simply in love  with being in love. With a kiss With a touch but mostly,  with a memory.    &nbsp;  ~fin~

       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    While You Were Sleeping    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     &nbsp;   2:17 AM.&nbsp;  Lonely and cold.  Drawn inward by inexplicable sadness.  Exhausted.  physically, mentally, emotionally  Dead.  You’ve chosen me.  Your Angel.  Your victim.  Your always.  You’ve brought me down,  stripped me down,  tied me down.  You laid me bare.  Made me open  Made me trust  Made me vulnerable.  You kissed me gently.  You whispered softly.  You touched me slowly.  And then you bled me dry.  Kissed me and consumed me.  Loved me and emptied me.  Filled me and spent me.  2:28 and I remember.  Bloody pages and scarred wrists  from the last time I was bare  the last time I was opened  the last time I trusted.  Tear-stained and blade-weary  My hands,  my pages,  my mind  can take no more.  No more love  No more lust  No more pain.  Blood and chocolate and endless cell phone calls.  I can’t get to you.  Can’t make you see.  Can’t make you understand.  Can’t  understand.  Please don’t leave me  I can’t live without  the luxurious pain you bring  I’m only happy when it rains  Blood, sweat, and tears  my eternal nourishment.  my only nourishment.  2:35 AM.  Lonely and cold.  Dead in the dark  with only the cat to trail  small, bloody footprints  up the stairs,  down the hall  to the room where we kissed  where we loved  where we slept,  where she’ll curl up next to you.  You’ll wake in the night  to her small, frightened body  curled in your arms  and my blood on your hands  at 2:43.

        “Only Human”  &nbsp;  I am a fifteen year old boy.&nbsp; My name is Shaun.&nbsp; I know you can’t really generalize anything, but I’m going to try anyway.  ~~  You develop a certain intimacy, being someone’s friend.&nbsp; When someone trusts you enough to tell you everything, you develop a certain love.&nbsp; Consider, for a moment, being told a deep dark secret that of course everyone has at least one of, and knowing that you are the only one told.&nbsp; Makes you feel all warm and fuzzy, does it not?&nbsp; What if your “best friend” happens to be of the opposite sex?&nbsp; How many times do the two friends end up “falling in love” with one another?&nbsp; Or is it really love?&nbsp; Sure, they love each other, but are they in love?&nbsp; What’s the difference?&nbsp; Suppose, though, that they end up dating.&nbsp; Will anyone question them if they kiss in the halls?&nbsp; Will anyone notice their stolen caresses in the darkened passages?&nbsp; What if they are of the same gender?&nbsp; Is it then no longer okay for them to be together?  ~~  So I feel for her, is that so terrible?&nbsp; She loved me, I loved her.&nbsp; It never really disappears, for the emotion remains.&nbsp; But while I know I loved her, was I in love with her?&nbsp; Maybe love isn’t meant to be understood or interpreted.&nbsp; Maybe a girlfriend is just a friend that you kiss.&nbsp; No objection, right?&nbsp;  ~~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  So what if I told you that everything said is true.&nbsp; I did love her, and still do.&nbsp; She was my best friend.&nbsp; Assume, even, that a girlfriend really is just a friend that you can kiss.&nbsp; But I am not a fifteen year old boy.&nbsp; Fifteen, perhaps, but a girl.&nbsp; Has your opinion of me changed?&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; You’re only human, right?&nbsp; What do you know about love?    ~fin~    A/N: A vignette I wrote for Sophomore English.

       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The Truth Within  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  You cry that you can't handle it   That you can't handle me   But you can't go on without it   You're more than people see   You know we are all liars   You know we all deceive   But what you think each one conspires   Depends solely on what you believe   If you open your doors   And let one lover in   What then when she pours   Her own life from within?   Will we both remain?   Will we both be lost?   Is it worth the risk for the gain   No matter the cost?   You know we'd both give anything   To know you belong to each   And yet the choices of your heart are remaining   Too distant, far out of reach   I was not the one pleading   I never wanted you to choose   But now I lie here bleeding   Your love, my life, I'll lose   Inside you know you like the hurt   Knowing that our souls will burn   And as we three play our charade,   Our time runs thin with each passing day    &nbsp;  ~fin~    &nbsp;  A/N: also written long, long ago.&nbsp; kind of seems ridiculous, all that emotion, now.&nbsp; I guess it's always a little different when you look back on it.&nbsp; Thanks to Ruoxi, who put up with me *through* all of it.&nbsp; I LOVE YOU! Not that you'll ever read this...

       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  My Broken Glass  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  &nbsp;  You say you want me   You say you need me   You say you love me   You lie   You love her and we all know   You tried to make me believe   "I will not fall back into her world"   But I will not be drawn back   Onto that broken glass   From the bottle I threw myself   I have repeated this cycle   This fallacy   Too many times   I have made myself lose   Too much life   Too many tears   Too much blood   I will not stand for this   You say you feel nothing   You say you love her   So be it   I will live, I have before   But ifyou ever hurt her   It will be you   Lying on my broken glass.    &nbsp;  ~fin~    &nbsp;  A/N: written long long ago about an ex-girlfriend who started dating another ex-girlfriend.&nbsp; I'm now very good friends with one of them, and barely on speaking terms with the other.&nbsp; I never could figure out who this one was really talking to.
