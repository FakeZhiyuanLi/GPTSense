      ::WORTH:: hey everyone! Long time right? Well shit happens. The summer is so boring. All I have been doing is sleeping and watching movies. That's it. Incredibly exciting right? DRAMA:Adultery. My friends are fucking each other that's great isn't it? Oh well it doesn't bother me anymore because... Beyonce said it best," me, myself, and I that's all I got in the end". That's the truth I found out that im better off without anyone be relationships aren't worth it....**DAEVION: I pushed him away for no reason what-so-ever and I am now willing to face the truth that I love him more than anything in the world and it was not worth the relationship that I wanted to work but the reality of it was that it never was going to work out, and I could have been with the one whose love for me was undying, to attempt a relationship with someone who lies about everything and who only wanted ass. :::DAEV... I love you::: Au Revior

      whats up bitches! its friday the thirteenth! woo-hoo its so great. btu anyways i had a fucked up dream last night it was about my daevion. but the only think that is really vivid and that still troubles me is the fact that someone said it all was a  hoax.  i hope to god it wasnt. but then again it would be ok if it was because i miss him. and i  still  love him to this day. well now that i am sad again im gonna go...

      im tired of people again today and i have only been awake for a total of 29 minutes. oh well. i have i get my new cd's today that would be great because i gotta fucking go out of tow to see my uncle and his wife, who i disown. she is a bigger bitch than i am. but of well. that nigger(aka the sperm donor) hasn't called back aparently what he has to say wasnt important. he's prly back in the hospitol. sucks to be him don't it? i dont give a shit about him, because he expects me to act like a child and not voice my opinion and that is not me. he got a rude ass awakening when he was here. but now he doesnt have a reason to come back. like i hate him and his mother because they expect me to respect them and they dont show me any so fuck that. you've got to give respect in order to receive it. but i love my aunt. she is cool and everything, she is so much like me its crazy. she is nothing like them. my cousins are alright too. well im gonna go.... Bye

      i thought shit had changed but i was wrong by far. i dont care anymore it is out of my hands. just listen to me when i say: DONT EVER INTRODUCE YOUR FRIENDS TO A SIGNIFICANT OTHER. i am tired of the summer, well this summer because so much bad shit has happened. i am prly going to court which is a good thing because hopefully i wont ever have to see the sperm donor. he is a fucking fag. but oh well. im so sick of people. well only 3 years right? bye

       im bored... but thats the norm.  but oh well its all good tho. i want devan to come over tonight that would be great... but she will try to bribe me into telling her about what "it" was saying about her, and im not because i dont want to hurt her or anything, and i kno if she knows what he said will truly hurt her.

      aliens and boredom have taken over my mind... im bored....but anyways... i was just thinking why do relationships have to be so complicated? is hasn't that way with daevion but nothing was with him. Adultery, Monogamy: The hardest things for any man. The purpose of why i will stay a "single cold superbitch" until the day i die. *Thought* --Why can't people (in general) be what their not?

      HOLA EVERYONE! today is a good day not like the rest. im beginning to get over daveion...but im not that sure if it is a good thing or not. i hope it is but idk. nut the story behind that is that he died in a car accident on my birthday and i knew about it before it actually happened because of my dreams. that fucking sucks. so for the next few says after i vowed not to sleep because i did not want to hurt anyone else, and i didnt for about 5 days. but i cant not sleep forever. i just need some of the drugs that the kids were on in freddie vs. jason so i can not remember my dreams. but thats not something that can happen well thanx im sad now.   bye.
