      One of my favorite topics..Its there cuz I had always been intrigued with it...And the intrigue ceased when I decided to try it out..But it wasn't for fun...I just felt bad....Felt alone...Desperate.. I felt like I had no place to go...Nowhere to hide and felt as if I had been left alone in the world...I wished for people who were true..People who really cared...Not just people who seemed to care...But really didn't...I was tired of being with hypocrites...Besides I had been having other problems and felt as if I had nowhere else to go....So it felt better if I could just disappear..Permanently..To just stop being...To cease with this unnecessary existence....To simply...Die.....And it felt like a good idea at the time....And yes I know the obvious questions.... didn't you ever think about those who love you??...What about your family...Your friends???? ...Well I did think 'bout them....But I they had decided to continue living it was their choice..And either ways they would continue living....With or without me....So I felt as if I didn't make a difference in their existence....If they kept living it was their problem....Wasn't mine...And if I had decided to stop...It was my problem then...So I was stuck with it...And I didn't want to have any more problems....So I just wanted to get away...And even though it seems stupid now..It felt right at the time...And it was decided...I was gonna kill myself....End the deal...And I did.... At first I thought about a gun...Fast and easy...But then again not that easy,...cuz...Where the hell could I find it???.....So I gave up  on that one.....And then there was the knife idea.....After the first cut no blood came out....Well not as much blood as I wanted...Well as I needed to die...So it didn't work either...Then pills...I took right about 100 pills...But that didn't work either...It just seems they made the effect they should....But for a VERY long time...They were sleeping pills...And I felt snoozie(or whatever) for like about a week or so...Then I realized I hadn't been snoozie...Or sleepy...I had achieved my goal...I had died...I had ceased this existence..I wasn't there anymore....That's when I realized it wasn't worth it...That suicide wasn't worth the trouble..That everyone had problems....But tried to make them better...Not ran away like I did..And I regret it....Deeply...I got a chance to know how my loved ones were...How they reacted when they saw me dead...I had emotionally destroyed my family....My friends felt as if it had been their fault...And I tried to talk to them.....I tried to tell them. It hadn't been because of them...I was just not good at that time..And that I felt sorry.....But sorry didn't make it any better.....Sorry couldn't bring me back to life....cuz there was nowhere back from where I was...At was in the middle....Not in the beginning neither in the end...I was stuck in the middle because of my decision....Of that terrible decision...A decision that had marked my life...Well not my life...But my destiny...My happiness..happiness that had faded away...That had left my side...Like had left my loved ones' side..I was there I saw them...But they didn't see me they didn't feel my presence...But here I still stay...Stuck.....Confused...Living in my sorrow....Living in pain....Watching how everyone went on with their lives...And I didn't...And now it remains as my problem...But unlike the ones I had when alive this one can not get better...

      Death-..Once again on my mind that simple desire for something that only time can bring...Or maybe that accident I've always dreamed of...To die doing something I love...Or just walking down the street...Alone...As always...Just to die now...Alone...All alone leaving nothing behind..No one to cry for my death..My disappearance...For the way I just left for my own will...I had gone because I wanted to...I really do..I wish it would be as easy as it seems...I mean..Its just dying..I actually don't care where I'll go after death..It doesn't matter where my destiny shall take me when I'm gone..As long as I was gone....As for what I believe...Anything is better than being alive and having to be right here...Right now....As if there was anything left for me in this world...Anything worth my time..Anything worth living...Anything worth that so called  "limited time"  God.. (as if he was real jajaja)   gives people is just shit...At least for me it is...If anyone could ever want it..Hey its yours...Its not like I'm gonna use it in anything better...I feel as if I didn't need it...As if there was no use in having to live...Living was just meaningless...I was..And am, gonna die anyways...So why not just do it now?.....Why live anything more?.Some say life toughens you by experience...Bad experience...But I don't want to get any tougher...No more experiences...No more suffering....No more life...Please I beg you...Take this away from me....Take my life where I cant ever find it again..Take it somewhere else...Hide it....Disappear it....Make it fade away...Put it in a box...Lock it away...Lock everything I once had away...Feelings..Memories...Thoughts....Wishes...Dreams...Take it all away...I don't want it in me anymore...I just want emptiness...I want to feel nothing..At all...Just to be empty inside...So that I don't have to go through anything that could harm me...Ever again...Just to be hole...Empty.....Useless....

      “There is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world; there is only the comparison of one state with another.  Only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss.  It is necessary to have wished for death in order to know how good life is to live.”—Dantes(The Count Of Montecristo)

      There she was..Standing there in the middle of the night..All tied up inside because of her problems...No where to go...No one to save her from what she was becoming....Losing her self in the atmosphere...Loosing her self in no ones dreams...Loosing her self in between....Lost...Trying to find her way...Getting nowhere...Trying to find a place...A spot to stop hiding...Start facing what was going on in her life...To start realizing NOTHING was alright...And it was never going to be...Not ever....Never again..To realize..That she had lost it all...

      "I walk down the face of this Earth, alone. I am holding no ones hand, and no one is behind me saying keep on going, or keep on moving. When I stumble, when I trip, no one helps me up. I have to get up myself. That is being alone."                                                                                                                                                   -George Brooks-

      There I stood..In that dark cold night...Staring right into those eyes who had been watching me as I walked through that dark...Endless forest....Those eyes that had watched me...That had followed me..All the way through the forest....Then I got lost...That's the only reason I saw the eyes on the first place..I felt watched ever since I entered the forest....But I didn't want to look back...So I just went on...But now...I was lost...I got lost and looked all around...But I stopped in the eyes...Dark eyes...I could only see some little shine on the...But no color...Just shine..And I was freaked...I looked into those eyes..But wasn't scared at all...Those eyes seemed to be admiring me...Meant no harm...But as I looked at them they drank my essence..I didn't feel anything..I just felt tired...But I wasn't tired...I was just dying...Slowly...Maybe too slow to notice what was happening...To really know that I wasn't ok..That my life...My essence was taken away from me...Because I got lost and looked into those eyes...Then I died...After hours of staring...I died...Those eyes took all my Essence...They took my soul...They took all that made me...Well...Me...

      Never thought I would end up here...Where I was...Lost stranded...But happy....It's that kind of happiness that simply exists and is there for no apparent reason...That happiness that becomes confusing after a while...It's great being happy....But that day it was stranger than ever before..I was happy...Yeah great but then again it had no explanation.-...And I wasn't just happy like any other time that happened...I felt stupid....I laughed at everything and it all seemed great....What the hell was happening to me???....I mean not only the happiness...That almost never happened...WHY??...I mean not only that there was no reason...But that even though I was happy it didn't feel good...But the day went on...As for my conscious side..It went to sleep.....Then I woke up on this room with cushioned walls....What the hell had happened last night??....Why was I in a mental hospital..??..What did I have a straightjacket on??...What had I done??...What the hell was wrong with me?????... Then the doctor came in...He told me I had been killing people...But that I wasn't just killing them...He said I danced with them...Told them how happy They should feel to finally understand the meaning of life....That they should be as happy as me...Then I understood...All those days I had felt *happy* I had woken up in a police station acussed of inappropriate behavior towards other people..I was hurting them...Trying to take their lives away...But I couldn't...Until today...The day I realized that happiness just wasn't meant for me..It wasn't meant to be..I'd prefer being condemned to a life in depression than a minute of happiness in which I ended up killing people...Taking their lives was what made me happy...Keeping them...Even more...But being stuck in that white cushioned room took all the happiness away cuz when insane...It's better to just do what your mind tells you...cuz if u don't...Things get worse...

      Reach out..Find air...That's all that went through mi mind at the time...I felt tired...Had no air....Needed some air...To breathe...To live on to continue with this torturing existence...To live on in this pathetic side of the world...The only reason I had was you...And you in my mind always..I had to get over the place I was forced to live in...I had to become someone...Be something to get to you...To reach you....To finally get to be with you....To know myself...Cuz I find myself in you...

      I never thought that I wouldn't hurt...I really thought it would...For life....But it just didn't....I thought the pain I was about to feel would change what I was..For ever...But it didn't....The pain of the knife, the pain of death, the pain of suicide...None of that's real...There's no pain at all...Watch as my life fades away from me....Watch me as I stand there...Bleeding....Bleeding like I never had before...The life that I had once had was fading away...Leaving my side...And it was through the blood....That life went away....From me...

      Alone..Living by myself living in a world made for those  "sociable" ....Those considered normal...Common....But not for me....I turned out wrong...I went the wrong way around...I'm not a good part of society....Cuz I don't feel like part of any kind of society..Only my own...Not because I'm a bad person or anything like that....What happens is I'm not the same as everyone else...I've got my issues..My stuff..My things that make me feel good..But that seem  *weird*  for the rest of the people..I'm in my own little world....Living by myself..But still I'm happy....Cuz I don't have to be like everybody else to be happy..I just have to be me...

      Time stood still as I tried to trace my way in the fog..I've never been so lost..I've been trying to find my way for so long..But now I guess where I am is where I'm supposed to be..This must be home..I was home all along..But home doesn't feel good..It feels..Well...Kinda lost actually..I'm stuck in this war between what I am..And what I want to be..And what I want to be just doesn't make me feel better..So it's awkward..But its where I am and what I am..So that's just it..Good or bad?....Who cares its just me..

      actually I'm not entirely dead..Well my body is alive..But I'm not...My soul died..Very long ago...Ever since...Well, it's too long to remember..I believe people see me alive 'cuz its like a burden a have to go trough..Day in, day out of having to be in this fu*ked up place..Having to exist...It sucks ass..Who cares if my language is  *inappropriate* ..You'd say the same if you had to live here...Believe me you would...There's nothing nice...Nothing good about it...To have to go through this...Everyday...I wish I could die entirely..But I cant..I just exist because I have to..There's nothing more to it..And I wish there was just nothing..At all...No existence no living...Not having to be..

      I'm cold..Freezing..Lost..Fading away..Feeling alone..Left out..Desperate..It feels bad..But not bad enough to look for you...I'd rather live a life alone than spend 10 minutes with you..I'd rather talk to myself..Invent people...Have imaginary friends..Anything is better than you..I hate you..I wish you had never existed..Never had come into my life to ruin it..I wish I had never been your FRIEND..cuz I was a true one..You were just like any other hypocrite..Trying to get things out from me trying to know my secrets to then make them public..Betray me like any other bitch..But who cares..??..I'm better off without you..And I'm glad to realize what you are..I hate you..Very very much..Please die..You should..Just keep it in mind.. 'later..

      Life..Death..//..Somewhere in between..that place where you see those you loved in life..but don't seem to be able to get close to them...to have any kind of contact..you see them...you  feel  them..but they don't..they believe you're dead..and you are..but it doesn't feel like death...you don't even know how death actually feels like because you had things in the world of the living that you didn't do..that's why you're there...stuck in the middle..no sense in trying to go back...cuz there's no way back...

      Looking 4 a place...searching 4 a soul....to be just like mine...to like the same things I do...looking 4 you...to come and save me...to take me away from where I now am..to save my soul from me...from what I've become..from THIS....what I am....to take me away from where there's no way back..from where I cant escape..but now...I can't seem to find you..you're not here..and I can't search no more...I'm tired...exhausted of trying to find the one that will never come..now I realize I'm alone...left in pain..left in sorrow..left somewhere in between what is usually called  Good and Evil ...left in a place where I have to decide where I wish to go..but I don't even know what I want....what I wish for..where to go...left or right.."good or bad"...I cant decide...but being where I am isn't better..and I cant decide..

      That night was freezing....the cold made me shake....I couldn't find warmth anywhere...I put up a fire....turned on the heating system at home....everything...even made some hot cocoa...which I hate...but I couldn't seem to get hot...or even a little warm...I kept frozen...so I decided to go out...find another place to stay...maybe at a friends' home or something...so I went out...and then...again.....the cold made my life miserable...the car didn't start...the engine was frozen...same as me.....so I walked...I was staying at a house in the mountains....but not that far away from some friends' place....so I went walking...but I got lost..the road had been covered with snow and I had no idea where to go.....then I heard a noise...it came from the trees...I went there and found a little girl...lost..crying...I tried to talk to her...to hold her so that she wouldn't feel cold...but she went away....well not exactly....she just rejected me...and continued crying..I stayed besides that tree....near to the girl...maybe someone would try and save her...and well...I'd be saved to...but she didn't seem to be looking for anyone....she didn't seem to want to go anywhere...then she calmed down...sat besides me...suddenly she pulled out a knife...but not any kind of knife...It was one of those hunter ones....with all sorts of edges...I got kinda scared...and then she did it....she stuck it in me....I screamed...a lot...but no one was there...just that little girl....killling me..she looked at me....into my scared...hurt eyes...all she said was she needed to quench its thirst...I got confused...but didn't care....the pain was unbearable...and had lost the strength to move....to scream...to fight....to breathe....I was dying slowly...with a little girl....who just said she needed to quench its thirst...then when she saw me almost dead...she said...- I'm sorry..but it controls me...I have no life...since I made this decision it has been controlling me...this feeling hasn't left my body..and it will never leave..it needs it....I need it...I'm sorry...believe me I am...but there's just nothing I can do...I was lost...just like you are...but at that time it felt better....it made me feel better...and now...I cant live without it...I just cant and I'm sorry....I'm sorry you had to be the one who had to fulfill its need...for blood... ...at that time I felt some strength coming back...and I was totally confused....What was that girl talking about???.....What was IT???....then I asked her....she looked straight into my eyes....I wanted her to answer fast....fast before I died...she said she couldn't tell me...I begged for an answer...I needed it....all she said was if she told me she couldn't let me die....and I tried to smile...and asked her..again...to tell me.....to please tell me and save my life...but she said it had been because of that intrigue that she was where she now was....lost and trying to escape...she said shed rather let me die...than save my life...so that I didn't have to go through what she was going...but anything felt better that death at that time....and I told her I didn't want to die...she said she had warned me.....but that it had been my choice...and I was going to regret it...very much.....but I didn't care...so she did it...she  *saved*  me.....by making me drink my own blood....it felt disgusting...and everything became silent....I fell asleep...I woke up...at night...again....but I felt no more cold...the night was the same as the one before...but I only felt strong...the cut the little girl had made me...Didn't hurt....at all....it had even healed off....perfectly...in one day....I freaked out...What had she done to me???...What had she turned me into...and....where was she????....seeing as I has stronger than I had ever been and the cold didn't bother me...I began to look for her....I searched everywhere....but couldn't find her.....then I felt this urge....this need....I craved for blood.....human blood....but I wasn't like the average vampire....I craved for it...but I also needed the meat...I remembered the little girl giving me some she had saved from another body....it tasted great....and made me feel strong.....stronger than I ever had felt....and...even though I knew it wasn't normal....I went looking for someone.....to eat....while I was /hunting/ I looked into my pockets....there was a knife....same as the one I had been cut with...it was new...well it seemed new...and clean...in perfect condition...it was perfect for what I needed....and I found the perfect victim....a young woman....who's car had broken down...I was looking at her...from in between the trees..and I came out....walked towards her...looking snobbish and interesting....she looked at me and asked for some help..I said I'd help her.....but the need grew stronger....I couldn't even act as if I didn't want to kill her...to eat her...to drink her....so I just took the knife y stuck it into her stomach...she was in pain...same as I had been the night before...but I didn't care...I wasn't like that little girl.....I didn't ask for the woman to forgive me...I just killed her....took her into the woods..and ate her.....drank her blood...feasted on her meat...and fell asleep...I woke up the next morning...even stronger than before....but my conscious wasn't clean...I remebered everything....to the slightest detail....it felt horrible....I had killed and eaten another human being...but I was no longer human...I didn't know what I was...I looked human...but there was something in me that had changed...and now I understand what the little girl had been saying....how I was gonna regret making that decision...and I did..I regret it...too much...now I know what IT was...she was young..and didn't know what she was feeling..she called IT the urge she felt....the need for human flesh and blood...and now there's no way back.....suicide just doesn't work....eating other people makes you stronger.....strong enough not to die...and now I have to live with this....without having the strength to control myself..to end this up....because IT moves me...IT controls me...and I'm not like any other cannibal...there's something more to it...something that cannot be explained...something that's stronger than me and that has taken over me...a dark force...that took the human away...and turned in the beast..

      Death..My perfect state...That simple point where reality is a dream...A nightmare once lived...A simple memory that comes back to torment our soul...A place where no one wants to go back to...A point where everything seems worse that it is..Everything makes sense and it all sucks!...You stand in a point in which everything you do has a consequence...Everything takes you somewhere else..Somewhere worse than before...All of this shit that doesn't exist when Dead...Death is a rest...A simple lay back...Plain relaxation....A stage in which there is nothing..At all....An empty play..No actors..No actresses...Not even a back stage crew...Simple emptiness...No feelings...No dreams...No memories...No LIFE...

      Maybe I'm just lost..Confused..Just trying to find something that wont come..Searching for a reason to continue..To go on.-...To hold on..To keep on movin'..Feeling..Living...Just to be...To exist...But not just physically...cuz I do exist..But I'm dead...My soul is...My essence once felt desperate and left me...And I guess its now I find out about that cuz I've been living under a shallow mask..Hiding under this costume of what some believe that I am...Of that fake me that never was what  I wished to be ..What I wanted to become..But never did...And what I showed never felt like..Me....I was afraid of showing my true self...Afraid of being alone...Just afraid...Scared of societies reaction to...What I was...Then I faced and overcomed my fears..And showed ME..My true self..And everything I once feared happened..I was left alone left out....Hypocrites that once stood by me went away...Shallow thoughts and experiences were just forgotten...To me and everything I had lived them with...Then I just realized I was..And had always been alone...Just alone.....By myself..Alone in a world where fake...Is what they wanted..Fake..Is all they needed...FAKE...That is just not me..

      Then again...Death and suicide...Suicide and crime...Crime and murder...Murder and blood..Blood and...Me...Just me here...Once again with these dark thoughts that torture my fragile little mind..That make me doubt myself...My own mind makes me tremble...Stumble...Fall...Once again I've fallen....Straight down...I have fallen onto the ground...I've cut  myself...And I'm bleeding...Finally bleeding enough...I'm dying...Finally....Life is going away...Fading away..Leaving my side...Finally....And..Ironically by accident...I'm dying..Death is finally getting close.....Close enough for me to feel faded...Weak...Giving out my last throes...Scribbling some shallow words onto a paper...A paper that...I'm sure will be thrown away..Cuz when anyone finds me it'll be way too late..All that I'm writing will be covered by blood..The writings will be ruined...Too blurry to be read and it'll be way too late...Now I'm dead..And as I said it was too late...No one saved me...I'm alone....I had always been....Shallow people stood by me...Fake words and feelings...Forgotten memories...Things that just faded away...Like me...

      Blake has lured you into this dark alleyway. As you wait for your eyes to adjust, you feel something brush against your neck. There is a slight popping noise, of fangs sinking into your veins. You are paralysed, while the blood drains from your body. As the fangs retract, you feel a new strength, and a new coldness in your limbs. You have joined the ranks of the undead.

      "Through me the way into the suffering city, Through me the way to the eternal pain, Through me the way that runs among the lost. Justice urged on my high artificer; My maker was divine authority, The highest wisdom, and the primal love. Before me nothing but eternal things were made, And I endure eternally. Abandon every hope, ye who enter here."  The Gates To Hell -Dante

       By: TIRI!!!    I was sitting in the police station when someone called and reported a dead body in an apartment in Malibu Street. I was stuck with a lot of work but when I heard the name of the dead person I couldn’t resist taking the case. It was a guy that had been my friend in high school I just needed to know what had happened.  I went to this house, was huge, I entered the room and I saw the body lying out there, I thought how could it be possible that a person could kill somebody that special. I started investigating and picking up evidence, in that moment I saw some papers and the phone miss placed, placed on a table that was beside the bed, they were all disorganized like if he trying to get the phone had disorganized them. I came up to the table and there was a name that caught my attention Jane Warrens, she was a girl that studied with us in high school, there was an address and a phone number. It made me think about why Stewart had this information, so I decided to investigate more deeply. This was because I knew that he had a crush on her since she knew her and the last time I talked to him he still thought about her. So I made my people check his phone bill; his accounts and thinks that could take me to some idea to start looking for a suspect. When I had all the results I noticed that the name Jane Warrens appeared in most of the phone calls he made. I decided to investigate her more deeply. I went to her house and in the moment she saw me she didn’t recognize me, but then when I presented my self she knew who I was. We started talking about how life was going for both of us and in between the chatting I told her about Stewart’s death. She seamed surprised and with the look of her face I started doubting about if she that was so sweet could kill somebody. Then I met her husband, Mathew, a tall and strong man. He was really kind to me and I didn’t waist my opportunity to ask him what he knew about this murder in this moment a saw his reaction, he was really nervous and he didn’t know what to answer. I started to suspect of him but I didn’t tell them anything. First I investigated Mathew’s life and see what he did for a living and how he spent his days for the last 2 months. In between months there was a week where he got out of work and he didn’t leave a message were he could be found, I started suspecting. I started comparing information about the two guys lives and about things that had happened through that time. I noticed something strange, in those two weeks that Mathew had left him office with out leaving a message; his wife had been receiving some messages and some roses from another guy. This made my suspects more accurate. Mathew had been spying on her husband since the first letter arrived and when he discovered that his wife was cheating on him he decided to kill him.  	One week went by and now I had all the evidence I needed to take Mathew to the police station to make him some questions. I went to their house and I asked Jane were he was. He wasn’t at home, she told me he was working and asked me what was wrong, I told her about the evidences I found and she freaked out but I couldn’t talk to her I had to get the guy as soon as possible. I went to his office and there he was, talking on the phone so calmed and sure of himself, but when I entered and he looked at me he freaked out and left the phone drop. I told him he had to accompany me to the police station that I had some questions for him. He said that he was mistaken that he had nothing to do with the murder but still I made him come with me.  	At the police station I told him what was wrong and why I had called him to ask him some questions. He felt so confused like if he didn’t know what I was talking about it made me doubt, but I still asked him all sort of questions. After a while of talking and asking question he told me the truth, the whole story. We went into my office so he could feel more comfortable, we sat down, and then he started talking.   	“Two months ago I was on a business trip, closing a really important deal for the company. I was away for two weeks and a half and when I came back I noticed that my wife was behaving really strange with me. At first I didn’t care I thought that she had a lot of stress on her because around that time she was organizing a family party that was really important. A week went by, the party was over and I still noticed that behavior. I started to suspect that something was wrong, she came late at night saying that she was with her sister or with a friend talking about further parties and events they were planning to do, but that became so often that I started to investigate. One night I went to her mom’s house and I saw that her sister was there, when before in that day she had told me that she was spending the day with her sister. It was strange but I thought that she could be with a friend, or that by that time she was going home and we didn’t cross over in the way. I returned home expecting to see her there but she wasn’t. 30 minutes later she entered and when she saw me in the couch waiting for her she started to act really nervous. I told her where she was and she told me she was with her sister. From there I knew something was wrong the next night I decided to follow her. She drove over to an apartment, I didn’t now from who it was, from all the friends that she had and that I knew no one lived there. I freaked out, but I said to my self not to panic that maybe she had a client for another party. I waited out side until she came out. When she left I decided to go up stairs and see who it was she was with. It was a guy I had never seen before, so I started to suspect that she was cheating on me. I didn’t ask her anything when I got home neither she asked me where I was.”  	This made me suspect even more about Mathew and I told him that if from what he was telling me he didn’t think I was going to suspect even more. He told me to listen to him. So I did. 	“The next day when I went out for the news paper I saw roses beside it. There was a letter saying “To my dearest and beautiful love, Hope you like them and see you soon, love, SK” I picked up the newspaper and the roses I didn’t mentioned anything at breakfast and neither did she. The next three day I followed her and she went always to the same place and every day I asked her where she was and every day she told me she was with somebody arranging things for some parties. The fourth day I followed her until the 5th floor where this guy lived I saw her kiss him as soon as he opened the door from there I suspected what was happening next. I felt betrayed, failed, I felt so bad I didn’t know what to do. I went down; I jumped in my car and drove away without course. The next day she was acting as she did before all sweet and beautiful as the day we got married, but from what I knew I was the one acting strange. I decided I was focusing more on my work and let her drown herself until she had to tell me the truth even though I was furious and wanted to kill the guy. For the following week and a half I dedicated my body and soul to work because there was a mayor problem with the deal I had make like a month before, so I had to go out and make some things to straighten things up and that’s why I didn’t left messages, because we didn’t want no body to know what was going on and it was a really huge deal that maybe the company could loose a lot of money. So we wanted to stay shut. I knew about the murder the day after it was committed and when I saw you come in to out home I was pretty nervous because two day before Stewart was killed Jane went out late at night with the roses that arrived that day, it seemed like if she was trying to free her self from it so I didn’t notice but well I had already notice a long time ago. The day the murder was committed was the last day the roses arrived. That night I went out with some of my colleagues to celebrate the success in closing up the deal and having solved all the problems we had. I was almost mid-night when I went home, when I was parking my car, Jane’s car stationed beside. I suspected that she had gone to see him; I was so furious that I got in my car and told her I had forgotten something at the office that was really important. I got into the car and drove to this guy’s apartment I was really mad, I went to talk to him I knocked on the door but there was no answer. I knocked several times and then decided to through the door down. When I opened the door I found him lying on the floor with blood all over the place, I touched his neck to see if he had a pulse but he was gone. So that was when I called the police and reported the murder, and that’s the whole story” 	I was shocked on what I just have heard. How could I have been so blind not suspecting of her first. She trying to incriminate her husband saying that he came in late without saying where he was and all sorts of actions that he was supposedly doing but the truth was that she was the one doing them. In that precise moment I stepped out of the office and went for and order to arrest this woman.  	We went to her house and told her to come with us she was resisting and saying she had nothing to do with what had happened. But still forced we made her accompany us.  	Right back at the police station we placed her in a room to ask her some questions. She didn’t want to answer and we couldn’t obligate her to talk. So I decide to look for another method. I asked Mathew to talk to her and he accepted. He entered the room and as soon she saw him she felt so guilty for making him go through what he had gone that she confessed everything. She murdered Stewart Kent. The roses were all fake, she sent them herself to make it seem like if it was a guy that was obsessed with her, and that she was having an affair. She made this be so obvious to his husband so he noticed that she was having an affair and he went to kill the guy for stilling his wife. In the end she saw that her husband didn’t care so she decided to murder him herself but leaving evidence that seemed as if her husband had killed him. She also said that the affair never happened that the made it up just because she was angry with him because he didn’t close a huge deal for a party from where she could get a great amount of money she could use to pay a debt that she had. 	We let Mathew out; he had his face red and his eyes full of tears. He was so sad. We told him that everything was going to be o.k now that she had confessed. He asked me what was going to happen to her and I told him that because she had accepted the crime and claimed herself guilty maybe the judge could conceder the penalty. He thanked me about everything. I walked him to the door and shake his had. Again he said thank you  and with his soul in deep pain and tears running down his face I saw him walk away and jump into his car and drive away.

      My Dearest:  I've missed you very very much since that last night we were together and will hold that night specially in my memories for years to come. I've been turning it over and over in my mind lately, I've read your letter through at least four times, and would probably read it more times before I'm through. I've been sitting here, looking at your picture and getting more home sick every minute.  I've wanted that picture more than anything else i known of except, of course...you, yourself. I keep thinking of you darling, keep wishing I could be home with you. I want to leave in the worse possible way so I can come home to see you but...things don't look so good on that subject. This war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone I guess, I've never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now. I'm completely lost without you darling. I never realized i could miss any one person so much.  I just can't wait too much longer until I'm able to be with you again..  And live a sane and normal life.  Hidden Track.

      ..they sink and they drown 2 mins before they hit the ground...so i feel this is coming to and end..are gonna be there 'till then??..so we talk...we say forever not knowing how long it is...we say forever and promises brake before they're made..we say forever and we go...we leave and forever brakes!..  ..we sometimes believe in things that seem perfect...perfection ain't perfect and that as a fact can be easily proved. looking for completeness..fullfillment, joy! for this fake concept of total hapiness that gets easily overwhelmed by despair, it dies and so do most of our souls..they die looking..still trying to find out a reason...

      Am I freak in the darkness, or am I misfit? You speak them opinions to sink in so deep. But its alright, you're just an illusion confused by your narrow mind. Reality is up ahead in tha' distance, but that lack of persistance has left you behind. Now your reaching for your sanity, cause you're afraid of me, so don't fuck with me. You wanna ask me a question? Well I gotta question. How much longer can I tolerate this shit. Egos trip when your livin' on tha' flip-side. Drop out of a uterus and died, damn. I see ya' pointin' your finger, ya' stereotype me cause you don't like me? Well you don't even know me, punk. You don't know me. Stereotype me, cause you don't like me!! &nbsp; urlLink

      By: TIRI!!(all rights reserved)  Bill Moritz, known as the kidnapped boy, was a guy that had big expectations in his life, he wanted to finish school to go to university and study what he like best, ecology. He was a boy that liked exploration and he always said that he will dedicate all his life to go on adventures all around the world doing what he liked most, climbing. He had a great childhood, but when he was an adolescent he had a bad incident, he was kidnapped and kept for almost a year. But even though he had this bad experience in the past he had dreams of going to the highest mountains and reaching the top. Actually one of his adventures happened two weeks ago, when he decided to make a journey to El Cocui Snow Mountain. He was so excited he couldn’t wait one more day; he packed and got organized and left everything ready for his trip. Finally, the perfect and expected wild day arrived. He got on his car turned the radio on and left the station where they were giving the new because he wanted to know how the climate was on the area. Few minutes latter he stopped surprised of what he had heard over the news. He was really worried and scared, “The Cocui was filled up with guerrilla and the kidnap statistics was of a 90% probability.” But even though he was scared and not really sure if he should continue, he filled with courage and carried on with his dream.  The next day he arrived to one of the most dangerous mountain of El Cocui, named La Laguna de los Verdes. Bill started to feel and smell the soft and comfortable aroma of the wind and he saw the beautiful colors of nature; he felt so secure and happy, he knew that he was where he belonged, free and in peace. After a moment he heard a really strange noise that made him come back to reality and remember his past and what he had heard the day before. He was frightened, he felt as if he were living a flashback. He heard some gunshots, he was frightened, he didn’t know what to do he was paralyzed; he just wished he had returned when he had the chance. He started to run in no direction and after a while of running he ended up in a dark and endless cave. He didn’t notice that in the cave there was some ice blocks falling from the top and that in the floor there were some human footsteps, so he continued walking knowing that there he would be secure. After a while of walking, he heard some screaming; they came from far away, it seemed to be from a girl, a KIDNAPPED girl, who was screaming for help. He continued walking and when he least expected he was eye covered and he felt that someone grabbed his arm and painfully twisted it to his back, he felt as it thy were taking his arm away. He heard a man’s voice ordering him to walk, but because he was so scared it seemed difficult to do it. After a while of not knowing to where he was taken, he heard the girls’ voice again. Every time the girl voice got closer, and closer. Then instantaneously the bandage was off and he had the chance to look down and when he did he saw a small girl. The man made him sit down beside her and ordered him to stay quiet. Even though the man told him not to, he talked for a while with the girl letting the time pass and the night to arrive. When it did arrived he didn’t remember falling a sleep. At some point in the middle of the night he woke up all sweaty. He was home, in his bed and the day of his journey hadn’t arrived. He realized that he was living a lie, everything was ok when he figured out what had happened he calmed down, nothing was happening. He would be living tomorrow and his trip was going to be the first of so many trips to come.

Cayó profundamente dormida.  ..depronto despertó, no sabia donde estaba..se encontró encadenada y encerrada en un cuarto oscuro. Asustada intento soltarse, no pudo...tanto era el miedo que la invadia q no fue capaz nisiquiera de gritar...pasaron unos 20 minutos y entró un hombre usando pasamontañas-  tenia una voz algo aspera, poco confiable...ella pregunto donde estaba y entró en llanto... el hombre simplmente la miro..se le acerco..la violó y salió de la habitacion..luego oyó unos gritos, algo como "usted sabia que no podia tocarla"..unos golpes y luego un tiro de pistola..simple silencio...no entendia nada, entró una vez mas en un llanto profundo, entró un nuevo hombre...le botó un plato de comida y le dijo que se callara si no queria q él la callara.. ella se callo, por miedo a otra violación o algo peor....comio esa desagradable "sopita de frijoles" q le habian botado ahi. ..entró un hombre mas...se preparo para ser una vez mas herida...de cualquier manera. Éste nuevo hombre se quito el pasamontañas, era el taxista!..ella empezó a llorar de nuevo..este hombre la calmó...le dijo q estuviera tranquila...sino sería peor...le explicó q por ser la preferida de su jefe estaba ahi...q dependía de él si salía de ahí o no...no entendia nada...luego recodo una tarde llegando al bar...unos hombres estaban golpeando a Don Tito, su jefe...y este famoso taxista estaba entre ellos...todo tuvo sentido por un momento...luego recibió una llamada....la hicieron leer un papel q decia:  "Tenemos a Samantha, su favorita perro...le toco pagarnos o la matamos...volvemos a llamar mañana...tenga una respuesta o atengase!"    ..samantha lloro.....creyó q la iban a matar, temia tambien de la vida de Don Tito, había sido como un padre para ella y no queria perderlo..extrañaba a sus hijos...necesitaba escapar. ..decidio intentarlo, le daban 20 minutos al dia para ir al baño, lavarse los dientes y demas...la ventana tenia unas barras..pero estaban algo "flojas" ya....y así empezó su plan...iba a aflojarlas cada vez mas....a pedir un poco mas de tiempo en el baño dia tras dia....las iba a soltar....iba a escapar!...su plan funciono a la perfección...ese dia escaparia... ..entro al baño, como siempre...se paro en la tasa y quito todas las barras...lo hizo lo mas silenciosa que pudo......de repente la puerta se abrió!......el taxista entro...la puteo y se la llevo...la encerró una vez mas...las cadenas estaban ahora atadas a un poste en la mitad d esta nueva habitación.....con un pequeño colchon de un lado y le puso una telita inmunda y maloliente en los ojos.....era golpeada todas las noches por esto...aunque nunca mas violada... ..un dia entro el taxista, -"su jefesito no quizo pagar..y nosostros no podemos tenerla mas aca...nos dieron buen billete por usted...entonces hoy se va a su nuevo trabajito"...la cogieron y metieron en el taxi de nuevo... le pusieron una cobija encima....era ahora o nunca!..si en algun momento habia tenido algo totalmente claro fue ahi...o se escapaba o se escapaba...no habia de otra!..se quito la tela de los ojos....el taxi paro en un semaforo....el tipo que la iba cogiedo se levanto un momento para comprar unos cigarrillos.....quito muy sigilosamente el seguro....y abrio la puerta.....corrio como nunca habia corrido en su vida....solo corria...los dos tipos se bajaron del carro....corrieron detras d ella....simplemente no podia parar...ya habia logrado lo mas dificl...solo le quedaba correr...corrio hasta no poder mas...los hombres pararon antes...se escondio en una ferreteria...el dueño le pregunto q le pasaba...de buenas le toco un buen hombre..le llamo un taxi y le dio 5mil pesos para pagarlo...la vieja estaba traumada....ni a bate se metia en un taxi ya....entonces cogio bus, nada mas seguro q un bus...llego a su casa a su familia...a su vida!....volvio al trabajo al siguiente dia.  ...sentada en su cama espero a su cliente....termino y salio...decidio caminar...y jamas volvió.

       urlLink     It is the  passion  flowing right on through your veins  And it's the feeling that you're oh so glad you came  It is the moment you remember you're alive  It is the air you breathe, the element, the fire  It is that flower that you took the time to smell  It is the power that you know you got as well  It is the fear inside that you can overcome  This is the orchestra, the rhythm and the drum   It is the soundtrack of your ever-flowing life  It is the wind beneath your feet that makes you fly  It is the beautiful game that you choose to play  When you step out into the world to start your day  You show your face and take it in and scream and pray  You're gonna win it for yourself and us today  It is the  gold , the  green , the  yellow  and the     grey    The  red  and sweat and tears, the love you go.

      When you have the will You learn to forgive and to forget You have to - Collect the broken pieces and Humble hearted Stand up from the place you hide If i wouldn´t know to miss anything It couldn´t hurt me no more Mistakes tought to build life From the ashes, that fell down to ground  Without any pain it wouldn´t be the same Experiences made me strong - Not every pain hurts Deep inside When you learn to devide Don´t fear the danger Follow your heart to the light Live your dream and breath   .                           -Lacrimosa-

      If there is one ..I will, I would! I need one, at least one a reason to fight for.  No need to cry your tears mean nothing now. No need to ask, to beg for forgiveness I'm not the one who decides.  I'll be watching close NEVER to interfere again. ..I'll leave it,  leave you all behind simple part of a past  of which I don't want to come back to.  Life once felt great Then life stopped red(doesn't have to make sense to you) ...then it all made sense to me you give a damn... so why shouldn't I?  ..let it go ..let it be what once meant a lot ..is now meaningless  GOODBYE

      ..santi santi!   My dear, sweet child, That's what I do... It's what I live for... To help unfortunate merfolk, Like yourself... Poor souls with no one else to turn to...   I admit that in the past I've been a nasty  They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch  But you'll find that nowadays  I've mended all my ways  Repented, seen the light and made a switch  True? Yes!   And I fortunately know a little magic  It's a talent that I always have possessed  And here lately, please don't laugh  I use it on behalf  Of the miserable, lonely and depressed  (Pathetic)   Poor unfortunate souls  In pain  In need  This one longing to be thinner  That one wants to get the girl  And do I help them?  Yes, indeed  Those poor unfortunate souls  So sad  So true  They come flocking to my cauldron  Crying, "Spells, Ursula please!"  And I help them?  Yes, I do   Now it's happened once or twice  Someone couldn't pay the price  And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals  Yes, I've had the odd complaint  But on the whole I've been a saint...  To those poor unfortunate souls   (...)(...)  Come on, you poor unfortunate soul  Go ahead!  Make your choice!  I'm a very busy woman  And I haven't got all day  It won't cost much:  Just your voice!   You poor unfortunate soul!  It's sad,  But true!  If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet  You've got to pay the toll  Take a gulp and take a breath  And go ahead and sign the scroll!    Poor Unfortunate Soul, The Little Mermaid!

Hope is back in mind Light... Clear, bright, unveliebable Light.  You reached it You're fading Air? None Needing Much Fading Again Oxygen? None    Light Fading You Craving Hard Try Harder by the minute Die
