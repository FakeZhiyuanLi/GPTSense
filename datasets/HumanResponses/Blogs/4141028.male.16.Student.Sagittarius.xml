      I'll never go to another football game again.  Too much stuff happens that I don't want.    That's all.  Have a great weekend!

      Mine was cliche of a 16 year old's.  I went to school.  I finally got the set almost done for WCTV.  We're going to start filming tomorrow for Monday's broadcast.  I'm really scared that it won't pan out, I hope it does though.  I went to lunch.  I sit with a bunch of losers.  I'm not saying that I'm above them, 'cause there are 2 or 3 cool ones, but there are these 2 lazy eyed, game boy playing muthas that just make me feel bad.  One of them wears a bike chain around his wrist.    After school I went over to a friends house and listened to him play piano, he's good.  He can play a lot of different stuff that was written for guitar, like Matchbox 20's Unwell.  I think it would be cool to try him out in my band.  Oh yeah, I'm starting a band.  I set up my friends drumset in my practice area.  It's so small in there that you can barely move now, I like it though...except for the smell.  It kinda smells like must...but with wood thrown in the aroma.  Ahhh punk rock.  We're not a punk rock band though, we play more poppunk and emo than anything else.  I learned all of "You're So Last Summer" by  urlLink Taking Back Sunday .  I was so proud that I went inside and took a poop.  I'll let you guys know more about how the band is coming as we progress.  I'm hoping to have a demo made by the end of the year, a realistic goal in my opinion.  I've started like a million bands but I really hope that this one can be different.  I think me and Rick (the other front man) really want it.  Now we just need to find some guys who are also dedicated.  I have to get out of this town, state, region very soon.  I think I'll go insane if I have to stay here in Georgia for more than 2 months after college is out.    I hope you had an awesome day and remember to post on the message boards!

      Yesterday I got hit on by one of the ugliest sad-saps on earth.  I just hanging out after school with a friend when this girl approaches me. I didn't care at first, I just thought she was going to strike up a casual conversation.  Wrong.  The first words out of her ugly ass mouth were "Hey baby, you got a girl?" I replied nicely, "No I don't really want a girlfriend right now." Then she proceeded to grab my ass. At this point I thought she might be mentally handicapped so I just laughed it off, but when she kept doing it, I got mad. So what I did was I decided to rape her.  The End.  I made that up.

      Finally, I'm stressed!  I felt that I had been taking my life too easy but now...oh now...I'm so not. It's hectic now with work and yearbook and Wildcat TV and websites...yay! I'm glad that I can finally take my mind off of a few things that have been bothering me. I'm not one to put all my emotions on the web for anyone to read but let's just say it's been eating me away for awhile. So next time you get down or restless...just transfer schools where technologically inclined people are needed! Easy as that!  Sincerely Happy

      I bought the new Taking Back Sunday CD today, finally.  It rocked.  I thought I was out of that genre of music but I find myself listening to it more and more.  Move over Dave Matthews!  Nah, Dave is still god of acoustic.  I have been flat out fawking stressed at work the past two days.  I must have cooked over 5000 dollars in food, and made a bout a billionth of it in tips.  Last night I got 4 dollars, tonight...the big zip.    Anyway.  I'm beginning preparations for the SAT.  I think I'll take it in Nov. and keep on until I'm satisfied.  If you guys have ANY helpful information with studying or anything related to the SAT, please email me @: tbrenner@gmail.com .  Who Likes the new opening image?  I do.

      Today was great!  I actually accomplished something!  YaY!  I set up the TV lab, yes....along with many other things you are looking at the producer of SCHS TV.  So that makes me....  --School System Webmatser --SCHS TV Producer --Yearbook Stafee  I like it.    I met a few cool people.  They're girls...I can't seem to make any male friends, wait, I take that back.  I made 2 male friends.  They're kinda country but I can deal with it.  They want me to run cross-country...no.  I can't run from my house to my van without giving out.  I tried cross-country in 9th grade...I did it okay I suppose...I just kinda...passed out.  So no more of that for me.  You can see my skeleton of the SCHS website at: http://www.tylerzweb.com/schs/     Signing Off

      I wish I could say something in the blog to make it intresting...but I can't.  It was the same old story at Schley.  Teachers talking to students about trucks and fishing...sad really.  I skipped lunch because it's just awkward in there.  The principals are all men...that's not cool.  The more I go here the more I really want to go back to ASS....bad.  I don't know anyone here and no one here is worth knowing.  Oh well, I'll try to last through the first semester.  Sadly Yours.

      Today was okay.  My first day at SCHS was today.  I got there too early and just sat in my homeroom...alone.  I pretended not to be able to open my locker so I wouldn't be just standing out in the hall.  I went to my 1st block class, Chemistry.  The teacher is very nice, which is a plus.  The kids in there were rather accepting, they didn't make fun of me...so that's cool.  The I went to my 2nd block, now that's an awesome class.  I sit in a room by myself and make the school's webpage, awesome.  I don't have to be social or anything...haha god that's pathetic.    Then there's lunch.  Lunch was scary.  I sat with a girl who also transferred.  About midway through our lunch this girl comes up to me and asks if we want to sit with them.  The guys beside me were talking about their trucks so I figure anythings gotta be better than this.  So I sat with them and told them about myself.  I really liked that girl...she was nice.    After lunch I went to my US History class: I've never seen a more brainwashed group of kids on earth.  They were all Jr. Conservatives, it was crazy.  We had to do a read around on the war in Iraq.  I was the only person who opposed it...you can imagine the looks I got.    I went to Journalism 4th block.  Journalism was cool; they liked my ideas for fundraisers for the yearbook.  I think that the class should be fun.  They think I'm Mr.Yearbook and it's gonna suck that in MY Journalism class...we did journalism...not yearbooks.  That's about it for my day.  A Ram in Wildcat Country...strange days.

      It's only 10:30 pm so I'm not very tired.  I just got done putting up the new Slappy cartoon so go check it out.  If you've stumbled upon this page somehow and not heard of Slappy...I shall take this opportunity to inform you.  Slappy is my bitch.  I own him.  He likes to make fun of people in politics because 99% of the time....they deserve it.  Slappy isn't saying that he should be president...but he is saying that he knows people who shouldn't be.  If Slappy absolutely had to pick a candidate for office...he would probably pick Ralph Nader, I don't know why so don't ask me.  I really like Slappy because he seems to be everything I want to be; made of binary data, limber as hell, and very good with the ladies.  I hope you get to go meet Slappy and if you want to email him, you can!  Drop a line to Slappy for new comic ideas or just to tell him hey at:  tbrenner@gmail.com  Slappy Loves and Cherishes you .   (yeah I stole that from [adult swim])...so what?

      I remember leaving work last night...that's about it.  I went to my brother's fraternity house and uh...gave back to the community.  I'm not the fraternity type but I work with a few Kappa Sigmas and they're cool.  So..why not?  Now I'm at home waiting for tomorrow so that I can bring my wrath upon Schley County High School.  Suckas.

      Last night was crazy at work.  It was a little to busy for me.  After work, me and a couple of friends decided to go to Burger King.  That was about all I did at night.  Yesterday was my last day at ASS and boy...awkward.  I had to explain atleast 100 times to teachers and friends why I was leaving.  I should have just recorded it and played the tape when badgered about it.  The principal, Mrs. Wilson, was probably the worst.  She was bent on convincing me that I should stay.  She asked me why an dI said, very politely, that "I just feel like the school is still in a transitional faze and I don't care for it."  She said they weren't.    WTF!?!  The school isn't done!  There are 5 or 6 classrooms in a trailer park beside the gym (which also isn't finished).  There are teachers that don't have classrooms and have to lug around their school supplies and such on a cart from room to room...all that seems pretty transitional.  However, I didn't have the time to sit around and argue with her.    Today I have much of nothing planned.  I'm going into the workplace @ 4:30.  That's about it.  I might buy an Icee or something.  I have to get crap ready for Schley, too.  I care.

       "Love not things of worldly nature  The Bible tell us that we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we shall not take anything out. Everyone should know this, so we are told to lay up treasure in heaven.  The question was asked of a rich man who had died. "How much did he leave?" The answer, "all of it!"  What we do here in this life for God will be stored up in heaven waiting for us if we are saved, amd we are not to love this world or the things of this world. If we love the world, the Bible says, "The love of God is not in us."  That nice house, that sporty car, that money in the bank, you are going to leave it, so lay up treasure in heaven by serving and worshiping Jesus.  Marion Jones  Ellaville"   --Taken from Americus Times Recorder website.   Okay...now here's MY take on it!  God wants you to succeed in this life.  I don't think God wants you to be homely and not have anything of value in your name, that's stupid.  I don't think your life should be focused around these materials...but it's not a sin to want to own a sporty car, have money in the bank, or live in a nice house.  Marion Jones I disagree with you...I bet you're poor and just want to make yourself feel better.  With Love.  Tyler -1  Public  -0

      It's looking like I will be a Schley County Wildcat soon.  I went to school at ASS and it was a typical day; overly dramatic, uptight people walking too slow for me.    Then I went to Schley.  I like the school.  It's clean and not confusing...only one story.  They freaked when they heard that I could build websites...it seems that no one knows how to there...sad really.  I met the head tech guy and he agreed to let me work with him 2nd block so that's cool.  Then 4th block I'd be in journalism and since I've already taken it once...so that shouldn't be such a big deal.    The only thing I am going to miss at my old school is Lit. class.  I like Literature a lot.  I think that that was the one class in my entire 7 that I felt like going to.  The people were nice in there and I will definitely be keeping in touch with them.  I don't know for sure when I start but I will definitely let all of you know.    Fare the Well.

       As you may or may not know, I have been contemplating the idea of switching schools to Schley County. The idea was originally my parent's, but I guess it grew on me after the months went by. So tomorrow I have to go at 1pm and sit and talk to with counselor's at Schley. Schley is supposed to be a good school but I just have too many friends to leave behind. I would and could still see them, but not as often as I'd like to.       I just farted.      Anyways, tomorrow I will take what happens until 1 at ASS (Americus-Sumter School for you non-knowers) and then take how much I liked Schley, and deliberate. These next two years are important and I really want to get everything out of high school I hand for college. I just hope their Technology Labs are actually up-to-date.
