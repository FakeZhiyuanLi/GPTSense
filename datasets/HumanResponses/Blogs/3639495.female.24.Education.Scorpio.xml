       Let's all pause for a second to give it up for the unsung heroes of the human race:   TRAFFIC COPS!  No, I'm not talking about the beat cops who apparate in your rearview mirror out of thin air, Dumbledore style.  I'm sure there's a time and a place for forcing people to obey basic speed law, but they never DO seem to be at the right time or place, do they?  Sure, when you're trying to slink off to school at 7:50, there's no shortage of black and whites, but when your car nearly gets tidily-winked off the freeway by a bass-thumping, low-riding, erector-set-detailed rice rocket.   Wow.  How old was that sentence?  Nevertheless, it is therapeutic to wave your fist in the air and yell "young whippersnappers!" in digi-rant form.   No, I mean the "standing in the middle of the intersection with the white cotton gloves and scary polyester pants" traffic cops.  An integral cog in the machinery of modern society that I've always taken for granted...  Until last Saturday.  Dateline: Devore, California.  A little patch of Appalachia nestled amid the junction of the 15 and 215 freeways.  Nothing but dirt and monster trucks for miles around.  And then, rising like an oasis of pure rock & roll in the wilderness, it stands: the 40,000+ seat Hyundai Pavilion at Glen Helen.  My sister and I headed out to Glen Helen this weekend to see the No Doubt/Blink-182 concert--a double bill about which Jennifer wryly observed "we would have killed to see that show... seven  years ago!"  It DID have a major 1997 vibe up in here.  Nonetheless, it was a rockin' show, and we had a great time.  It turns out music was pretty strong in the last millennium.    So: encore, No Doubt is coming out for their final bows, and Jen and I decide to hightail it out of there to get back to the car as quickly as possible.  Unfortunately, about a thousand other people had the same idea, but that's okay: that's still a head start over the other 39, right?  We're hauling as fast as possible back to a parking lot that is somehow exponentially farther from the venue than it was when we left it earlier that evening, trying to save precious seconds by cutting in front of slow-moving couples, bobbing and weaving through people-traffic like the aforementioned rice rockets that irritate me so, but the possibility of making it onto the freeway two seconds earlier than the rest o' the dirt people somehow excuses our inconsiderate crowd wading behavior.  Finally, success!  Back at the car, squeezing into the tiny gap formed when we open the doors without scratching our neighbors' rides, throwing it into reverse without backing into the drunken hordes streaming out of the concert, and then: hurrah!  We're facing out, we're heading up the aisle, we're on our way, one of the first out, nothing can stop us now!    And then: a car about five spots up pulls out into our lane, and the two of us are trying to get out.  No problem.  Then, a convertible beamer with a truly heinous lady inside pulls in front of us.  But that's cool, we're still rolling...at a snail's pace.  Then another car pulls out.  And another.  And so on, and so forth.  And they tell two friends, and they tell two friends.  And all of a sudden, EVERY car has been pulled out of its spot, but there's nowhere for ANYONE to drive, because we're just a huge line of cars, pulled out of their spots, with nowhere to go.  Our brilliant plan of beating everyone else by sliding out juuuust at the end of the encore turned out to be  everyone else's plan , too!   But that's no problem.  Jennifer and I are good times, we can entertain ourselves, we own some kickin' tunes, we're in no particular hurry...this line will start moving soon enough, right?  Half an hour later, after having moved maybe THREE car lengths total, we turned off the engine to preserve precious battery juices, which means: the small comfort of occupying ourselves with kickin' tunes must go down the drain.  Lots of other cars started getting the same idea, so now, we're a whole line of parked cars that only occasionally grind on the engine to roll forward a precious few inches forward, so as not to let any stragglers back their cars into the tiny pocket created by unaware drivers.  Still, we're still good company, right?  Jen and I have the best of times...when we're in a happy mood, which is 99.44% of the time, a la the purity level of Ivory soap.  (David Letterman once said the other .56% of Ivory soap is filled with pure jam preserves...crack open a bar and check it out for yourself!)   You know what gets us into the other .56% of the time faster than anything else?  People.  Lots of people.  Large herds of agitated, obnoxious, drunken, mildly frightening, brain dead 909ers who haven't the foggiest notion how to MERGE properly so as to get out of the parking lot safely.    Merging.  Huge, tough concept that Los Angeles natives take for granted.  Every other car and you'll get there soon enough, we PROMISE.    But guess what?  If NO ONE agrees to let anyone go in front of them, there ends up being an eight-car can-can line at a standoff in front of the two-lane driveway, with no one able to squeeze their cars out of the spot because no one's willing to give an inch and let anyone squirm ahead of them.    And each of those eight cars in the can-can line have an ENORMOUS line of cars behind them, equally unmoving, except to close tiny gaps between cars into even tinier, nonexistent, wafer-thin slices of air between bumpers, so as to ensure NO ONE take their spots, either!  And the longer Jen and I dwell in that .56% of our personalities, the more we start becoming agitated and unsafe 909ers ourselves, such that we soon developed a rule for ourselves that, as long as we could see the printing on the top of the next car's license plate frame, we weren't too close.  Bad.  Bad, bad, bad.  As we are parked in this car...not even feigning hope that one day, movement may happen, Jennifer unbuckles to slither up out the car window and survey the landscape.  Nothing but parked cars for miles around.  No one is moving.  Lots of angry red brakelights, and even angrier fists slamming against steering wheels that really never did anything to deserve such violence.  She also sees: a few people who have given up entirely, and have pulled back into a parking spot to take a nap and wait out the traffic; the occasional pod of tailgaters numbing the pain of our hellish standstill with countless empty 40s littering the back of their truckbeds...yeah, I really want to share the road with those guys in a few...years, or whenever we'll get out of this lot; and oh-so-worst-of-all, a few hair-tossing, giggly, slithery-looking girls who have decided to pass the time by making their dates grateful that they don't need to pay attention to the road because SO many more interesting things can happen in a  parked  car!  Ick.    Yuck.    Ew.    Noooo!    Remember that convertible in front of us with the truly heinous lady inside?  Yeah, well, so will everyone else who walked up our aisle on the way to their cars that night.  Which, we must confess, did make a decent diversion for a few minutes as we watched other people comment outright, exchange horrified glances at their friends, flash their highbeams or honk angrily at the silly trashy woman.  Oh, and to her man's credit, he didn't seem too into her either, because seriously: silly trashy woman!  Convertible!  No!  Long story short, (YES, this IS short, compared to the actual agony of being there!) can you imagine our abject horror when,  two hours  later, we've made it to the can-can bottleneck of cars at the driveway, and we realize that the problem was that Glen Helen Pavilion hires NO parking lot attendants, no traffic cops, no one with the foresight to think, hmmm...if we told which cars to go and which to stop, we'd ALL get to go home a little sooner...  Anarchy in the parking lot = total automotive stagnation.  Drivers left to their own devices = unparalleled stupidity.  Dirt people suddenly evolving into polite sensible individuals who give others the right of way = as likely as when pigs fly at the speed of sound and finally master the art of outrunning Farmer John before he can saute them into full-fat bacon.  Mmmmm, bacon.  Never mind that, once we've made it out onto the street, it's still a sub-1-MPH crawl the final stretch to the freeway, where we somehow managed to anger the truck a few lanes over into a double-fisted flick off, followed by proctologically-close tailgating, high-beam flashing, and attempted faux-ramming worthy of that silly 70s B-movie,  Death Race 2000 .           Do you see how driving REALLY ought to happen faster than a mere 500 yards in 2 hours?  Maybe it's just me, but don't venues have an obligation to ensure their patrons can LEAVE the concert they've just paid an arm and a leg to attend?  Wouldn't it just be good business sense to have your customers leave satisfied?  And how much trouble would it be, really, to have someone don a pair of white cotton gloves, and do the pinwheel arm motion (go go go!) or the palm out motion (stop stop stop!) at tens of thousands of drivers?  What a waste of hosting a truly rockin' concert, Glen Helen, because  everyone  stuck in your parking lot that night would rather get their eyeball caught in a beartrap than endure your particular brand of psychological abuse EVER again.   Moral of the story: if Jennifer and I had to live out the mind-numbing agony of the Glen Helen parking lot, we'd hate to see all our pain and suffering go down without helping our friends and family avoid getting their limbs caught in the meatgrinder as well.  I'm sharing our pain as a public service, a cautionary tale, and a call to action!    Boycott Hyundai.  Shout angry things out your window as you're cruising up the 15--or, at the very least, save those angry fist-shakings for the young whippersnappers who designed the traffic patterns there.  Write strongly worded letters to the proprietors of Inescapable Labrynthine Parking Lots, Inc.  But most importantly: do yourself a favor, and never, EVER buy tickets to any concert at Glen Helen Pavilion.    Think I'm just whining? Blowing things out of proportion?  Flexing my muscles in the Hyper-Bowl of hyperbole?  Try this on for size:     urlLink http://www.nodoubt.com/band/journal.asp?newsID=13454   When was the last time rock stars flitted down from their gilded cage to apologize to  you  for forcing you to take a foretaste of the third circle of Hell?  Of course,  none  of this could've ever happened if we had a decent traffic cop on our cotton-gloved hands...  I'm just saying!

       (Or at least, Musings Sprung from a KCOP Broadcast, but what kind of sexy title is that?)    I'm watching the Dodgers/Giants game right now.  That is, it's on directly behind me and I keep having to swivel my chair around to catch any exciting plays as I am not an owl and cannot swivel my head around 180 degrees.    Pity.  'Twould be such a fine fan skill.    You'd think it would be a brilliant teaching asset, but the truth is, my students have NEVER seen the back of my head!  I'm of the ever-watchful school of thought.  As far as I'm concerned, the best teaching advice ever is "You know, kindergarten is like the ocean...you don't want to turn your back on it."  Trust me, students in kindergarten and junior high are very similar: ready to climb the walls the second you let your guard down.    P.S.  Guess where that brilliant piece of educational theory came from?   Kindergarten Cop  (1990).  You know, that pre-gubernatorial Schwarzenegger flick far more famous for lines like "It's not a too-mah!" when the little kid thinks his teacher's headache may be cancerous?  I swear, that's one of the best teaching films EVER--my Mommy and I both love the part where he collapses onto his bed from sheer exhaustion after his first day of teaching.  That's, like, a true-life account of our lives EVERY SINGLE DAY after school.  Brilliant movie, you should go rent it or just sit still long enough for them to run it with umpteen commercials on TBS.  It may remind you of the charm that enabled Arnold to bamboozle California voters.  Oooh, snap!      But the good news is: this is baseball, so I have little need for head-swiveling and plenty of time to write between exciting plays.  Don't judge me, Vin Scully!  You know baseball is slow.  There's no need for constant TV staring like you have to do hockey-style lest you miss a second of excitement.  Strike that.  Like  I  have to do hockey-style. I think normal people are capable of movement during games, trusting in the unbridled goodness of instant replay.    Amateurs.  [By the way: I choose, at this early point in the summer,  not  to whine about the possibility that there may not be any hockey next fall because of a "strike/lockout nobody wanting to work" situation.  Look at me, showing restraint!  But I reserve the right to whine in the future, because SERIOUSLY, no hockey for me is like you getting your arm lopped off in a tractor accident.  Or in whirring helicopter blades, like that snarky bald man on ER.  Good times.  End tangent.]  Tied at 2, bottom of the ninth, Giants have a runner on first, in case you're curious.  Hey, guess what?    You are a  GRAMMAR GOD !   If your mission in life is not already to preserve the English tongue, it should be. Congratulations and thank you!    urlLink   How grammatically sound are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Yea, me!  Frankly, it would be bad news for my students if it didn't say that, right?  That's from a grammar quiz that my friend Laura mentioned on  her  blog:   urlLink http://www.livejournal.com/users/tree_and_flower                                        I may be a divine grammarian, but WE (the Dodgers, remember that's how this started?  Oh, yeah!) just walked two guys, 'cuz we do that, so now bases are loaded.  Dumb.  I wish I had angry sports voodoo like my Great-Aunt Mary.  She rocked the crazy mojo or juju or whatever you prefer to call it.  She'd sit at the kitchen table, pushing string beans through this tiny razor-like contraption that split them into skinny little slivers...julienne beans or whatever, while muttering curses in Spanish at a fuzzy TV set or fuzzier transistor radio.  I should go buy a housecoat and some beans.  Maybe I could work up the serious anger with some Mary-like props.        Some guy named Ransom just hit a lame single that my sister could easily stop despite being three seasons rusty with all her softball skills, meaning we lost.    See why I need voodoo?  More than that: see why I need writing to distract me?  But the good thing about baseball, that even Saint Hockey can't offer, is that there's always another chance tomorrow.  Hurrah for hellish working conditions for my boys in blue, off days are for wimps when you get a six month winter break!   Still, boo for making me waste an evening of head and chair swiveling on a San Fran win.  Ewwwwww....

          "The time has come," the Walrus said, "to talk of many things.  Of shoes, and ships, and sealing-wax; of cabbages and kings.  And why the sea is boiling hot.  And whether pigs have wings."  - - from Lewis Carroll's  Through the Looking Glass .   Out of context, that section of the poem has become a charming little cliche for "I have a lot to talk about" or "Gee, I have a myriad of interests!"  In context, actually, it's a bit less cute.  The English teacher in me wants to pique your interest enough that you go look up the whole thing and rediscover some poetry.  Sufficed to say, the walrus and the carpenter are using cutesy small talk to lure unsuspecting baby oysters to their death.    Really!  Check it out for yourself:  urlLink http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/walrus.html      And if you're too lazy to read, (well, you wouldn't be having this little exchange with me, now would you?) go rent the Disney version of  Alice in Wonderland .  In it, all the oyster-slaying barbarism is acted out for you by little cartoon walruses (walri?) and carpenters. (That one I know, a la the 70s brother-sister act of "We've Only Just Begun" fame. By the way: I make it a point never to sing love songs to my brother--but then again, I  always  make it a point to eat on a regular basis, so I guess Karen Carpenter is not my role model in many things.) Ooh, and the "barbarism" has a friendly "G" rating, no reading involved.  The time is long since past for me to talk of many things, it's just I finally have the time to do something about it.  And seeing as I'm going to be staying in the teaching biz for at least one more year, I need to have an outlet for all this pent-up writing energy.  While all my colleagues run out into the real world brandishing new Journalism School degrees and an armful of clips to gain entry at elite newsrooms in Boise, Bakersfield and Barstow, I'm left behind trying to get my writing out into the world.  The cult of the journalist, just like any job worth doing, is wrapped up in a major Catch-22: you've got to be published to get published.  In other words,  my  J-School degree means very little on its own.     The Polish side of my family has a saying: "Find a way."  It sounds much fancier in Polish, but then you wouldn't know what I was saying, would you?  As long as the writing bug is in my soul...and it's in there good, I tell you...I've got to find a way to get my ideas out there.  So if no one will publish me just yet, I'll publish me.    Really, it's not so silly as it sounds!  Just ask Izzy Stone.  Izzy--officially I.F. Stone--was an amazing investigative journalist who worked just about everywhere in New York throughout the 30s and 40s muckraking to kick up the big stories.  But it wasn't until the 1950s when he started his own paper, the  Weekly , that Izzy was able to make the biggest impact.  His small paper became a cult source of information for politicians, city bigwigs, and just about every journalist at those big papers he left behind because his work was so thorough, passionate, and unfiltered.    That's every writer's fantasy, even if they're too faux-modest to admit it.  So Izzy?  Here's  my  Weekly in weblog form..give or take a steady timetable.  So Dad?  I've found a way.  So everyone I've lured over to this site for a first look at this blog?  Don't let the title scare you off.  Sure, being a demi-Pole, there's bound to be some talk of cabbages.  And okay, being a hockey fan from Los Angeles, there will undoubtedly be talk of Kings.  But beyond that?  Movies, politics, friends, brilliant ideas, complaints, celebrations, half-formed thoughts, real-life, and everything in between.    Get set for talk of many things.  Some of it important, some of it Seinfeldianly insignificant, but all of it pure, unfiltered me.  Cheer, cower in fear, scratch your head, read, skim or ignore...but know this: the time has definitely come!    I can only hope this opening post strikes you as a charming little cliche to let you know I have lots to say, and not a sunny diversion just before I lead you into a barbaric slaughter by unchecked rambling that even those poor, devoured baby oysters wouldn't envy...

       Hey...I hear those people who are able to regularly update their blogs do so because they actually PUBLISH things, rather than building one epic rant piece over several evenings.   I guess it's time for  VH1's Behind the Blog: Maimed Snail .  Reliving the parking lot experience kept making my mind so weary, I'd fall asleep.  It happened, like, four days in a row.  Uncool.  Must get better at this.  Okay, that's all.  Happy Fourth of July, everyone.  Happy 228th birthday, Declaration of Independence.  Only a John Han-cocky person like me would bother taking up so much room on an uberimportant historical document, or take up so much room in your busy day reading a fulmination on the poor driving habits of dirt people.  Ugh.  The thought still gives me chills.  If you don't think Hancock was an obnoxious fellow for writing so big, then you must have the proper tolerance for me.    If so, read on...

         So, with an eye on dusting off old rants and raves (see: August 9th for the full-on blustering explanation of why these old ideas are just finishing now), here's one bit of schlock I started way back on July 16th...     Check this out:      "Five charming sisters on the gayest, merriest manhunt that ever snared a bewildered bachelor! Girls! Take a lesson from these husband hunters!"    -- An honest-to-Pete quote from the honest-to-Pete trailer for the 1940 version of  Pride and Prejudice , starring Greer Garson and Sir Laurence Olivier.   Wouldn't I love to take credit for finding that gem on my own? If only. Actually, I just finished reading  The Jane Austen Book Club , by Karen Joy Fowler, and she has this whole Reader's Guide worked out in the last 40 pages of her novel with 200 years of responses to about Austen's work. That quote was the definite winner.  [By the way, a close second in the race for pure excellence is "Every time I read 'Pride and Prejudice' I want to dig her up and hit her over the skull with her own shin-bone." - Mark Twain, 1898. Note that, as torturous as he finds Austen, he  does  subtly 'fess up to repeated readings!  ...One can only dream that my writing will be so repugnant to the authors of the future that they will long to exhume my rotting corpse to beat me down with my own femur (which is a sturdier bone and could do MUCH more permanent damage than a delicate shin--I know enough of Twain's brilliance to presume he would choose THAT bone instead, given the chance to choose again!)]  So tell me, fellow citizens of 2004: how do you like  them  apples?  Manhunt? Husband hunters? Snaring a bachelor? Taking a lesson from their example?  Oh, the gall of MGM! I'm so shocked!  Right?  Well, I was. Actually caused me to drop the book in surprise and run it to Jennifer for show and tell. "Can you believe this?" and the like.  It's condescending and chauvinistic. Tacky and trite.  Not to mention just plain silly.  And then, with an inward gasp of outright horror, I realized something:   I'm  a husband hunter.   Of course  I am. Not only is that idea unsurprising, it's expected. Understood. Implied.  It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single woman in possession of good breeding hips, must be in want of a husband.  That's not the shocking part.  The shock comes in openly admitting such a hideously antifeminist thing. In 2004. With an Immaculate Heart education, no less!  ...that's just NOT done!  Which is a very antiquated notion in and of itself. Subjects being taboo, admitting such a thing is unladylike, everyone's thinking it, but no one's saying it, yadda yadda yadda.  It's "Elephant in the Room" syndrome.  You know, like that little dance we all have to do when we try to describe people without reference to race, body type, physical disfigurements, Siamese twins welded to their foreheads, etc.  Instead, we learn to refer to people as, "you know, that guy who was standing to the left of that girl who was wearing orange that one time?" Rubbish. When it would be far easier just to bust out with "I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith..." without fear of seeming like an a-hole for pointing out his general pegleggedness.  Poor Smith the Wooden Leg. The PC police won't let us speak of him anymore. Curious how being subtle about something is far preferred, albeit entirely less efficient.  "I'm a husband hunter" is the PC-equivalent of "Well, he's black" on the tact-o-meter. No one with an ounce of class would ever say that.  Which is precisely why  I  can.  Although (to be fair) I'm of a generation that has traded in cotillions for  Girls Gone Wild , so I'm not exactly a pith-helmeted, tranquilizer-totin' big-game hunter compared to some ladies...  And thank goodness for that! But:  Even a person who seems Zen as can be--sitting in her rowboat, casting a line out onto a seemingly fishless glassy pond--is ultimately hoping to pierce through a trout-brain or two herself! Don't be fooled by the lack of outward-bound showiness...hunting is hunting either way; "getting your hooks into someone" isn't an expression that appeared out of nothingness!  As I was saying: I  was  shocked when I saw that MGM quote--especially the bit about "Girls! Take a Lesson!"  Jot down notes, learn their moves step-by-step, do as they do!  "Ew!" said I, for that is how I was raised to react.  Except we really do, you know. We take down notes.  Not out loud. Not in any notebook. Not in the secret depths of our girlhood diaries and journals. Not even in a way that we ourselves notice or recognize. But deep down (where we all know those fish are hiding!) we're taking  mental  notes. Imprinting ideas, thoughts, reactions, attitudes, responses deep in the subconscious levels of our brains.  We're using pop culture to program ourselves for future mating rituals. It's all very anthropologically sound. I'm sure, had I the formal sociological training, skills, knowledge and information, I could perform a formal study that would arrive at that very conclusion. We upload tidbits onto our own cerebral diskettes at a teeny-tiny age.  Ergo: everything I know about snaring bewildered bachelors, I learned from watching TV. And movies. Reading books. Or any time I  stopped  singing along with pop music long enough to comprehend the meaning behind the words.  Maybe I never enrolled in Olivier's school of man-snaring, but there's a whole stockpile of course notes coiled deep in my cerebrum from sources as far-flung as  Anne of Green Gables , The Beatles,  When Harry Met Sally ,  The X-Files, The Baby-Sitters Club  and the Colin Firthization of Jane Austen herself.   Pride and Prejudice  went on to be a monster hit in 1940 and is still in constant rotation over at Turner Classic Movies to this day. Most people would credit the widespread popularity of the source material. All apologies to Miss Jane, but that's fantastically naive. Advertising! Pure and simple. Savvy, match.com "Your ideal mate is waiting!" SPAM filtered into the inboxes of moviegoers 60 years before email.  In the age of political correctness, the League of Women Voters or Planned Parenthood or Gloria Steinem or Oprah's Book Club would tackle MGM in a second flat for throwing a movie tagline like that out into the open.  That's a bit of a shame. Still, I don't think I'd be comfortable in a culture where everyone felt free to wave their every inappropriate thought about completely unfettered. I prefer to be the only one lacking an internal monologue.  Although I can't have completely abandoned tact...after all, I made it all the way through this post without  once  mentioning MGM's description of their movie as the gayest manhunt ever.  Aw, phooey.  ... almost  made it!

       Have you ever had someone disappear on you for such an unbearably long time that the morbid half of your brain pauses now and again to wonder if said someone is, in fact, dead?  Yeah. Me too.  Sorry to have been the cause of your latest death-musings.  -------------------------------------------------  Seriously, that would make a  sweet  greeting card. "Sorry I faked my own death" and the like. Very popular among Mafia goons, eccentric billionaires and soap opera characters.  Not only am I alive, I am chock-full of interesting things to say and share and contemplate. So why, you may ask, haven't I written for the last month?  Two things, really:  a)  I'M BUSY!  No, really. It looks like I'm on vacation, but I haven't had a free day in a loooong time. And YES, I know I can't whine, MOST jobs never stop at all, blah blah...  Society as a whole has a big ol' chip on its collective shoulder about teachers getting a summer vacation when the rest of the civilized world has to work nonstop. Trust me--not only have we earned our time off, it's the reason why more students aren't killed by their teachers each year in an act of frustrated rage.   Know how I know? 'Cuz golly by golly, that almost happened to me...but that's another post.  Anyway...even without official work happening, the days keep filling themselves! Sadly, the bank account does not. So in that sense, it will be nice to get back to work, but it is kind of a fun existence being faux-unemployed. Like I could fulfill some excellent professional hobo riding the rails fantasy because I have time on my hands, without falling into actual, crushing unemployment that involves having to search want ads and employ head hunters.  P.S. This is also why, if you live within the sound of my voice (no, really, I'm uberloud, that IS all of Southern California, stick your head out of the window right now and see if it isn't true!) you not only haven't read anything I've written lately, but you haven't seen much/any of me, either. My existence at this point is something of an urban myth. Blurry photographs exist, and a few people claim to have sighted me at the gas station or In-N-Out or something, but really, at this point, I'm like Elvis: only my rabid fans hold out enough hope to believe those stories.  Which brings us to:  b)  I DID WRITE!     No you didn't, I'm looking at your blog right now and I can SEE nothing's been written since July...do you think us totally daft or what?  Bear with me, irritated readers!  I really did write--in fact, right on time, within a week of the last post, I totally brought an entire off the wall essay together, and then I  lost  it! No lie. I went to check a preview of my post to see what it would look like (because I'm so vain and previews are the mirrors of the writing world. In case you're curious, or feeling smart-alecky, YES, I do think that song is about me. I've gone on record several times about that fact!) and when I came back, the page was BLANK. Oh, it was tragic. That was a gorgeous post, it was.  So, I set out to rewrite the thing, and in doing so, a lamentable thing happened: I got too tired to type. Combo of two things: I write very late at night as it is, and I was frustrated at not being able to replicate the gorgeousness of the OG post. Which is when I discovered a VERY dangerous thing:    Save as Draft   As in...start this now, come back to it when you feel like it, I'll hold your place 'til then!  "Save as Draft" is a sexy little icon at the bottom of the typing page I use that reassures procrastinators like me and gives us free reign to put FINISHING our work off for infinite mananas.  Very dangerous. Because when I came back, I didn't feel like THAT post anymore, so I started another. Got tired. Saved as draft. Came back. Had lots of good ideas, but really wanted to get this new idea out into the world. Started a third post. Got tired. Saved as draft. Went on vacation. Came back. Wanted to write about the vacation...you know, "while it's still fresh!" Got tired. Saved as draft.  Yes sir. Yes ma'am. I have four works-in-progress on my behind-the-scenes page. And remember than unfinished for me is like an encyclopedia for a normal kid, so we're talking about a decent chunk of hidden work.    See , I'm  not  a nasty old liar. I  did  write. I just never got around to actually PUBLISHING, is all.   Oh. That's an important step, I guess.  So what did I do when I signed on this evening? Why, started a fifth post, of course! You see, I needed to explain what all this silence from the cabbage-front was about. But fear not, loyal readers: I'm not allowed to Save as Draft here...I need to be strong and face my fear of endings.  As school is starting again soon, I have to pull together all my summer vacation loose ends--and THIS is one of them. Hidden work must be given a chance to play in the sunshine!   Stay tuned over the next week for posts on: 1) Why sexism is really quite refreshing, 2) The worst form of psychological torture, 3) The future will be a scary place, 4) The band so incredible I asked security to rebound my poorly thrown panties back toward the stage.  I kid you not.  And as I do better with deadlines, even artificial ones, I figure if I finish up one unfinished symphony per night, I'll be all caught up by the weekend. Which should give me plenty of time to write one more new thing: "Germans: Not just for world domination anymore!"  And then, seriously: don't ever expect that kind of flurry of activity from me ever again. Once a week is plenty, thanks!  Please consider this my contract with you, dear readers. Then, if I don't deliver...you can come after me with a pitchfork and lit torches.  Until then!
