      25/5/03 Namaste, I must say it is very convenient having a cheap computer in the hotel we are staying at. But sadly like most things in life this must come to an end, today. We have decided today we must move out and go to a Nepalese family to start our Nepali lessons. Right now we have one family that will take us for sure, but are hoping to find a slightly tutor who we can stay with. This morning we will go and talk with her to see if we can afford her.    As to the last couple days... well we had our first mishap yesterday. As it turns out we got in the wrong shuttle from the airport and went to the wrong hotel. We went to the Tibet Guest House, not the Tibet Peace Guest House, Oops. After a couple phone calls and some talking the manger here at where we are staying, after hearing we are students and looking to help the Nepalese people said we could stay here for the same price we would have had at the other hotel of US$10 (and this one is much nicer, about 2 times the price, and has computers) so it worked out in the end. The manger also was very interested in helping us out and offered for us to stay in his house while we were learning Nepali. He also invited us to his house for dinner. Oh it was good food, jackfruit curry with pounded rice, yum yum, with just enough spice for me. We talked for a couple hours about Nepal, tourism, culture, etc. and I guess had our first interview for our research.    We decided after dinner that we would ride a bus back some of the way to our hotel and walk around 1-2 km back to the hotel. Equipped with direction we headed out, we got of the bus fine and started walking, walked, walked, and walked right past our turn, for about 20 min. When we hit temple central in downtown, we realize we missed our turn, and it started raining. We had quite a nice walk in rain it is very different on the streets here then in many places I've been, more respectful I think. We managed to find our way back to the hotel, a little bit wiser and a lot wetter. After a handful more phone calls and showers we settled down for bed, jet lag is a pain. Although Pete and I stayed up chatting in be, kinda reminiscent of youth retreats where you talk all night and your councilor keeps telling you to go to sleep, yeah.    This morning, I got up at a little before 5am (jet-lag), where Pete seems to be doing better then me in this department. I decided to go up to the top of out hotel and watch the sun rise (don't worry folks, I got photos). Pete came up just as it was rising to see too.    Soon we will be off to see our (hopeful) future tutor.   A couple personal replies...   Christine L, do keep me posted on how Germany is going, I would love to hear.   Nicora, Thanks for the prayers and I was very busy those last couple days. (I did get to see the Matrix before I left too)   Mel, I understand why you love Thai Air.   Eric Holmlund, Pete was wondering if you send the externship paperwork to the 3 Sisters?   Sunny, I'm on the photos, all over them in fact. Don't fret.   Annika, it is great to hear from you, it sounds like that rafting thing is right up your alley, I was missing all of you CRROBS folks the city here has a lot in common with San Jose, memories. Also do you have current e-mails for everyone, I had a couple get returned to me. Thanks.   Thank you every one for your prayer and thoughts. All of you who have been added, welcome. If anyone is getting this in error, I'm sorry, just ask and I'll take you off. God is taking care of us and providing everything we need when we need it.    Steve (& Pete)

      24/5/03 We are on the wrong side of the world, or right side depending on your perspective. For me it all started on Wednesday, with my chauffer and I (thank you Steve, a diffrent Steve at that) went to Pete's house in Gloversville to get closer to JFK. I had to pack till 1:30 am. We got up to go at 4:30 am. and drove, drove, drove down to JFK arriving at a descent hour, around 8:30ish or earlier, right now time is upside down... so please forgive any error in time. We lollygagged in JFK until 12:30 when our twice-delayed flight left. Our plan was covered in Pokemon, including pokemon chair protectors on the head area. "Can anyone say pickacho?" -Pete. Much different from prior flights of mine, we requested the Asian vegetarian meal, it was great! We got curried veggies and tofu! On this 13 and a half hour flight to Tokyo Pete managed to sleep some, but I could not so I watched 5 movies, read some, and tried to sleep. We got in to Tokyo around 2:30pm Friday weird how one whole day kinda just disappears when you cross the date line. 6ish we got on our flight to Bangkok, after exploring the Tokyo Terminal a little bit. I found more curry Pringles, I'm taking orders now, and with carrying fee I figure it will be around US$3. It was a 6 and a half hour flight to Bangkok, but we got two hours back arriving around 10:30pm. We hoped in a ride to our hotel, a rather nice one too... to go crash for a couple hours. Up and out at 8am on Saturday for our last leg of air travel, a 3 and a half hour flight to Kathmandu!   Yay, we are in Nepal. Finally, two days later. We have settled in to our hotel (Tibet Guest House). It is Saturday, the major day off so we can't look for a Nepali tutor today, but have made contact with the 3 Sisters, and another personal contact, Dr, Khatry, who has invited us to his house for dinner.  Thank you to all of you who replied to the first letter, I hope everything is going well with you too.  And here are a few personal comments:  Mom & Dad, my leg is doing well, but is still a little uncomfortable.   Tammi & Mike, sorry I didn't get a chance to get out to see you, I got kinda backed up. We will have to give it another try when I get back (unless you wanna come here?)  Dr. Hale, Thank you for connecting us with Dr. Khatry, he is being most helpful when we are in a place that is new to us.  Thank you,   Steve (Pete too)   P. S. If this is your first time getting this letter, I hope you want it, it is an update that Pete and I are going to try to send out to all of our friends state side while we are in Nepal for the summer working on our senior thesis. If you are receiving this e-mail in error, please just ask and I'll take you off. Also please feel free to forward this to anyone who you think would appreciate it (especially you Mrs. Scarpa).  P.P.S. Pardon my spelling errors and typos, it is not my fault, there is a little demon in the computer.

      21/5/03 Hello everyone (or should I say goodbye),   You have all been chosen (or asked for it) to be but on this list that Pete Scarpa and I (Stephen Waldron) are going to send updates from Nepal to. If you don't want to get this newsletter from us please just tell me, if you know anyone who would like to be on this tell me, and also please remember we don't have a regular computer access... so please keep replies to text only.  Now that the jargon is done... Well we leave the US tomorrow morning with high hopes of a nice two days worth of flying and a overnight in Bangkok, Thailand. I'm almost packed, and I'm assuming Pete has been packed for days. For those of you that don't know exactly what we are doing (or even that I was going anywhere...) we are going to Nepal for the summer, till Aug. 21st. What are we going to Nepal for you might ask? Mountains, Glory, and Fame. Sadly no, we are going to do more down to earth things, namely: work for an internship, and research for our Capstone (senior thesis for those non-Paul Smith's people) Pete and I are studying The Desirability of Trekking and Eco-tourism to the rural Nepalize people. Our plans right now are to go to Kathmandu, Nepal for a couple weeks where we will get Nepali language intensive till our brains hurt so we can communicate relatively well with the locals. After filling our heads with this Nepali goodness, we travel to Pokhara, Nepal near the Annapurna Conservation Area to work for The Three Sisters Adventure Trekking Co. for the rest of the summer. While we are working we are going to do our best to talk with locals to see their side of Trekking and Eco-tourism. There is all the goodness.  As of right now we do not have an address of where we will be in Kathmandu, but if any of you would like to send letters we will be able to get them when we get to Pokhara at the address below make sure to state it is for Pete or I in the heading, I love real letters and will write back.     3 Sisters Adventure Trekking (P) Ltd. P.O. Box 284 Lakeside, Khahare, Pokhara, Nepal - 6 I hope all of your summers will be a good time and I assure you Pete and I will do the best to have a good one too. I look forward to seeing you when I get back this fall, or when life brings us back together.   God Bless, Stephen Waldron

      Tuesday 24/6/03 Namaste Motorcycles… Hmmm what a totally different thing they are here in Nepal. In the US they conjure up images ranging from the Hell's Angles, folks in their mid-live crises, to young men who just need to ride, but it is reserved for the few who chose to take the risk of riding a motorcycle in the US. Here in Nepal it is a completely different story. First there are as many motorcycles as there are private cars (maybe taxis even), if not more. They are ridden by everyone; the only people I have not seen on a motorcycle are those who are too old to hold on. In the US my bike a 500cc Honda is a small sized motorcycle with most bikes up above the 800 or 900cc range. After a month a diligent searching the larges motorcycle I have managed to find is an Indian made Honda XL dirt bike at the size of 185cc, a baby by American standards. Most bikes here are in the mid to low 100cc range being from India and China, with names like Honda Hero, Dajling FX Adreno, and other such weird names and styles I have never heard of. The engines barely if at all fill the engine compartment, leaving huge chunks of empty space in the frame often filled with a toolbox the size of the single cylinder engine below it. Because motorcycles are the most efficient and cheapest form of transportation they flourish, and are used for everything. I have them used as taxis, delivery bikes (with way more stuff then should be legal on them), tow trucks, and family vehicles (dad, mom, son, and baby daughter on the gas tank), with the best thing ever being a couple with their daughter and the DOG straddling the gas tank!  They zip in and out of traffic with little to no regard for oncoming traffic. They even have a specially made rack on the rear left side so women can ride with dignity wearing their saris side saddle without their sari getting pulled in to the rear wheel. The Nepalize government had a good idea when they made it a law that all motorcycle riders must wear a helmet, but I think the benefit is lost as almost no one uses the chin strap to hold it on and many of the younger generation find it more stylish to wear them on top of their heads then on their heads.   Thursday 26/6/03 Today in the afternoon I went for a walk by myself down the lake. I just got a little stir crazy and really needed to just get out and go somewhere. Don't get me wrong I love where I am, but it is really rather frustrating when there are so many beautiful and amazing things around that I just don't have time to go see. They are to far away for me to go see without skipping a class or two. So I decided (neglecting my teacherly duties of preparing a test for Friday) I needed to just go walk up the road and see what was there for a couple hours. I grabbed my camera and nothing else, which was not the smartest thing to do given the season and how half of the sky was full of dark clouds. So much for thinking, that was never my strongest suit when I feel "I just have to go do something!" After about a five second debate in my head I decided that I would go north away from the city of Pokhara towards the northern end of the lake that has been hidden from view from the guesthouse to see what was down there. I had seen enough of the tourist-infested streets of downtown Pokhara. There are moments when, even though it is not peak tourist season, you can see more foreigners then locals. I guess in peak season the tourists over double the amount of people living in Pokhara. I'm rather glad I didn't come in a better season. I think that there might be times while I was walking down the street with all of it's gear shops, restaurants, music stores, and other stores with all of their signs in English and their shop clerks talking in English, that I would forget I was I Nepal. I have also been getting rather frustrated with the drug dealers that walk down the street "Hallo, you some smoke? Some magic mushrooms?" It makes me wonder why is it that most of the people who travel tend to be in their worst form when they travel, doing things that they would not normally do at home (one guy even runs every morning in his underwear, I a place where men very rarely wear long shirts and never go shirtless unless they are swimming). Sorry, I digress, back to my walk. Armed with my camera and the urge to take photos, see more of Nepal, and just do go something, I walk. Just past the first bend I am blessed with a view of the sun beaming through the clouds on the beautifully terraced rice fields, freshly plowed and planted, acting as mirrors of the sky across the valley. The road in a typically Nepalize fashion wonders like a snake around the mountain ridges, ducking in to every valley and popping back around the next hill with a new and equally amazing view of Nepal. Nowhere in Nepal is it really very flat, except for the Terai plains in the south. After the first bend the amount of people dropped of very steeply. There were around five or six buildings spread across the valley amid the thousands of small rice fields. Their were a couple men out driving two yak bulls yoked to a plow preparing the fields for the teams of women who follow them planting the baby rice stalks with the speed and precision of machines.  Before long the paved road gives way to a dirt road littered with potholes of varying sizes. As I approach the next bend to see what lays beyond a young man about my age rides up on a bicycle and matches my pace. "Hallo, where are you from?" I have begun to realize that if someone greets you in English it can mean one of two things. He is either very educated and someone of respect or he wants to sell you something. If he asks you where you are from in the question that means he most defiantly wants to sell you something. Given his age and how he greeted me I was ready for the pitch, but decided to indulge him in a conversation. "America" "Oh, very nice place, no?" "Sometimes it is good, sometimes it is not, like anywhere." And so the conversation continues on. Then there it is, "Where are you staying?" I have realized that saying "oh I'm staying at…" results in someone coming by to talk and try to persuade you to do come to his hotel, etc. So I have adopted saying, "I am staying with a family" (in their guesthouse, but I think you don't really need to know that) this answer alleviates any further hassle about going to any other place. I also follow this with "I'm teaching English" proving I am not a tourist and don't need or want most of what tourist are interested in. I am actually here to help the Nepalize, not just to spend money. He stops hassling me for a little while and there is some silence, I begin to wonder if he will get the point that I was trying to have a pleasant walk away from development. He doesn't get my intentions; I guess in Nepal there is nothing abnormal with just having long silences in the middle of a conversation. He asks me "do you like kids?" he has noticing how I smile at all of the cute little boys and girls that I see as we walk. He continued with me for about half an hour or three to four more valleys worth, talking about mundane things, until he gone to far or he finally realized I didn't need anything and was not going to buy anything.  Back to just me, the road, and the locals working in their fields. Shortly I reach where the water stops being clear water and turns in to a marsh. I must have gotten out of the normal traveling range for foreigners on foot. When I was walking by a middle age man and his family did a little laughing and staring as I approached where they were working near the road. When I got closer I said "Namaste." The Nepalize will give you much more respect and much less hassle if you talk in Nepali. It shows that, you didn't just get to Nepal, and that you actually cared enough to take the time to learn a little bit of their culture that makes them who they are. He replies and asks me where I am from in Nepali. When I respond in Nepali they all start laughing and smiling. After a brief conversation he exceeds my Nepali ability and I bid them goodbye. Around six in the afternoon I decided to turn back, I have to be home for dinner at seven.  On the way back I smile at the working family again, they return the smiles and wave. Three girls came scampering down from their house (or what I thought was their house, but was only one of theirs) all looked to be around three to four years old. They were absolutely adorable; I have always been a sucker for the cuteness of young girls. The oldest one had a gold nose ring (rather abnormal, most all of the girls wear studs in their noses) and a beautiful bunch of orchids and other flowers. I introduced my self and we talked as best as I could manage given my poor Nepali. They giggled and smiled the whole way back to one of their brothers who was working a in the field down the road. I realized later that part of their laughter was because I had addressed them using "Tapaai" the formal and respectful form of "you" reserved for people who are older, or have a higher status then you. I should have used "timi" which is for close friends and those who are younger then you, Oops. With about half an hour to go before getting home the sky has gotten rather dark and a thunderous clap booms from the heavens. I stepped up the pace a bit, not wanting to get caught in the middle of a thunderstorm with no cover. Frustrated at how I neglected to grab my umbrella. Another young girl comes out of the fields and walks with me, says "money?" It hurts when such a young child begs. I smile and say "chhaina" (no). She leans on me as we walk, smiling. Again she says "money" "darri rarmo chhaina" (very good not is). She stops asking for money and just walks with me resting her little head on my hip, smiling. After a few minute she skips of to a house by the road. What do you do? I want to do everything I can to help them, give them a brighter future, but you can't just give them money. Later this evening over dinner I was talking to Lucky about children begging. She said that some parents teach their children to beg. She recounted a story of when with a group of trekkers and her were climbing up to Sarangkot (the 1598m hill behind the guesthouse) for a view of the mountains. The whole way there were many children with small typed card saying how their dad had died or other things like that and how they needed your money. This was shortly after the sisters had moved to Pokhara from Darjeeling so none of the locals recognized them. Lucky being a clever one, told the children that she was from the Ministry of Tourism and had come out here because of several complains from tourists of begging children. All of the children ran back to the village, presumably to tell their parents. I guess since then there has been far less begging children, but it is still a problem.  A very light sprinkle started to come down and I still had two more valleys to go. It looked as though I was not going to make it. But after about one minute of raining it abated. The sky remained foreboding. Thankful I was able to get back in time for a dinner of Chinese noodles, before any further incidents with the rain.   27/6/03 Life is continuing as normal here in Pokhara. I have found the laid back way of life here very relaxing. The extra time in the day has allowed me to pick up reading for pleasure again, something I have not done for quite sometime. In the past week I have read two books: The Best American Travel Writing 2000 and Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire. Both of which I recommend. I just started Heinrich Harrer's Seven Years in Tibet. I figured that since I could see where I am on the map in the front of the book I should read it…  Meanwhile, Pete has been working on preparing lesson plans for the advanced guide training we will be doing next week. I think it is time for me to go try to get photos of the two kids who are playing out in front of the guesthouse. I hope everything is going well for all of you.  As always if you would like any old newsletters just ask and I'll send you the old letters.  Steve  On a more personal note…  Unk Bob – consider it done. How is life doing down by the mountain?  Bidhata – 56 din Nepalmaa boschhu. Hamro bidarti haru pardnu improve bayyo. Ali ali. Tini haru din din padhdaichhau taara samai la batiouchha. Malaai tah ha chhaina.   Katy – I did get your letter. I miss the snow too, but I can see it in the distance, if I walk a little.  Steve F. – Sounds like a fun trip. And yes the mud is the way to go, it is like eating with your hands, at first you don't really want to stick your hand in, but once you do it is really fun.  Ian – Wisdom? If you say so. How is the TV coming?  Dad – I was thinking I would ride up next to you, I have a lot of junk, we'll see. Osgood is a very beautiful place.  Tim – you got to love getting work done. What was it?  Arthur – I totally agree that capitalism is the best thing going. My frustration is more at the evil nature of man, which spoils the effectiveness of all political systems. Capitalism takes advantage of the greed some by encouraging people to work with the promise of more stuff, but when left unchecked it allows those who have to take advantage of those who do not. In the global market over the long run this widens the gap between the upper and lower classes, and between the wealthier and poorer nations. Capitalism also lends its self to bureaucracy, which makes the whole process more frustrating and inefficient.  Nicora – I think we should market it, my pitch would be: Mang-Goo, It is sweet, it is sticky, it is Mang-Goo! I think it would sell like hot cakes! We could make millions.  Joanna – I can't remember the Bibbys, or Dan, but maybe I know them from the leadership conference a little while ago. I don't know. I did something like that with my motorcycle, I would forget to turn on the gas, and wonder why it was stalling out. Now I know better and check, but when I was learning….  Trish – I found your address and thought you might like this newsletter of me in Nepal.  Cameron - how is the living, motorcycle, car situation going with you? Do you have tons-of-fun's e-mail address?

      22/6/03 Namaste I think I could write forever on what I see and think about, if only my hands could keep up with my thoughts. We have hit the one-month marker. Nepal has set in; this is life, for now. On the platter for today I have, being a vegetarian in Nepal, Himalayan Mountaineering Institute, rice planting, swimming lessons, mangos, and the answers of life, assuming I can get through them all before I lose my inspiration for the evening.   I will start with The Answers to Life or something like that. Today I was in the shower/bathroom in which the shower is a showerhead that comes out of the wall in the bathroom with a drain in the middle of the floor. It ends up making it all rather covenant giving ample space to take a shower, brush your teeth and wash you clothes in a large metal basin, which as I was listing to the Nepalize weekend news, (in English no less) I was doing. It is strange how being in the shower tends to lead one to contemplate major things like the solution to world poverty and things like that. The latest breaking news in Nepal; seven Maoists were killed in a conflict with the royal army, the teachers union is on strike, requesting a seven point something from the government, the public transportation is on strike for something else (I missed it as I was rinsing the soap from my hair), in Nigeria an oil tanker exploded killing, maiming and severally burning many Nigerians who will be unable to afford medical help, and somewhere in Europe two championship football players were traded from one team to another in a one hundred seventy million Euro deal (sorry all of you World cup fans but I was never really in to watching sports and have no idea who they were talking about). These are all very interesting facts. My mind starts to think about (I think it is the shower frame of mind in action still) the football players who have a bright future of worldwide fame and a lifetime of commercials ranging from Speed Stick deodorant and Fruit-of the Loom jockeys to Mountain Dew and the new Subaru WRX sports car (that was for you Dan) not to mention the money. I don't know about you but I think that is a fair sized chunk of change. This train of though brings me to a rather long conversation Pete and I had with Sandeep, who has become like our (if you considered Pete and I brothers) third brother, about working and making money in Nepal. We figured out that Nepalize doctor who has been trained and has his degree can expect to make under five thousand US dollars in a year, other then government officials and maybe some tourism operators is a really good job, given Nepali standards where the average annual income is around the equivalent of two to three hundred US dollars. I made two times this in one year of working while going to school. It reminded me of the gap between living standards of Americans and those of most of the rest of the world. The Nepalize men and women work no less diligently then those of us who live in the states. Along time ago I gave up on the farcical notion that anyone if they worked hard could achieve wealth and high social standings if they wanted to. The completeness of this lie becomes more and more apparent as I talk with the people around me. The world and capitalism is not fair, the people around me will never have the opportunities I have most, with a somewhere between a high school and college level of education will be able to find a good job paying between two and three US dollars a day, if they are lucky. With the women assuming they even get that level of education can expect less. What can I, or the world at large for that matter, do to help people that live in these kinds of circumstances? And if there was a solution but it required you to give up some of the common amenities that have become essential to daily life, would you? Would I? Would everyone in the world? I doubt it. Oh well, I can still do something, how little it is in the long run, but I'll feel better, maybe. It is time to move on to better and brighter thoughts. I'm not in the shower anymore.  I'm going be a victim (as we all should be) to a horrific use of the structure of a good paper and will not follow my subjects in an orderly fashion. While I was in Senegal (Africa) Moss my professor said an African saying that happens to apply to Pete and I here in Nepal. "When the mangos are ripe, the kids are sticky" and oh am I sticky, it is mango season and I could eat a mango with every meal and a couple times a day. Once a day for the last few days a mango has sufficed, as desert after dinner. There is quite a little trick to eating mangos in the Nepalize way. First you roll it in your fist squeezing it and making the insides soft and pulpy, and then you bite of one end and squeeze out the juice and pulp into your mouth, slowly working out the large seed inside. After sucking and nibbling as much as possible off of the pit you tare the skin open and scrape the rest of the fruit out. Just the thought of it makes me salivate like a Pavlovian dog. Yum, they are soo sweet and juicy, if you are ever in this part of the world in mango season, you can nit miss this. I think the amount of happiness one has in a day is directly proportional to the amount of mangos consumed.   Following the food train of thought, I am going to talk about the pleasures of being a vegetarian here in Nepal (I guess in India too). Oh glory first everyone is a little surprised, but the have a great respect for you being vegetarian. Not once have I gotten the "Why don't you eat meat? That's dumb." Question. There is also a lot of respect for not eating cow, the holy animal, like many other foreigners do. This is because Brahmans (the upper caste) do not eat any animal products and they also do not consume and alcohol, assuming they are good Brahmans. So to say the least there is always a totally vegan option at every restaurant and everyone respects you for being a vegetarian. This is a huge difference then life in the west, where I think they could learn from some of these ideas. There is also an absolutely wonderful spinach mushroom burger that can't be beat. Oh an on your way over here make sure to tell the airline that you would like the Asian vegetarian meal, we got two amazing curries and veggie duck too, I highly recommend it.  One of the major staples of the Nepali diet is Bhaat (rice). It is rice-planting time. The last two days the neighbors have been working hard to plant their rice fields. It is quite a family affair; the men with two male yaks plow and smooth the fields to prepare them for the planting of rice. While this is happening the young boys run around (usually naked or in their underwear) catching fish that have been living in the water, but can't swim in the mud. The women and girls go in after the field has been made ready and plant the small rice stalks that have been growing in a small field and are now ready to be planted in the bigger fields. Yesterday I build up the courage to go out into the fields to get some photos of them working. After getting a couple photos, as I started to leave I slipped on one of the newly fixed walls covered in a fresh layer of mud that had not dried yet and my foot went right in to the muddy field with a nice "squich" sound. While extracting my right foot from the muck my left foot slipped over the other side of the muck into an equally interesting position. This was much to the local's entertainment. They hooted and yelled back and forth in Nepali. I extract my feet from the mud, minus a sandal, trying to keep as much dignity as possible but it was a lost cause. After getting back in to the mud I dig around to find my missing sandal, one of the young girls planting near me comes over to help me, but I find it just as she arrives. I say good-bye and thank you and head back, bare foot not wanting to lose another sandal. I thing in the long run it was a good thing, I provided a moment of entertainment for all the time over the last couple days I have watched them work while I work on my lesson plans from the balcony of the guesthouse. When I got back to the house, again I was the entertainment for the afternoon, they would greet me and my mud covered visage with smiles and laughter. I got photos and had a lot of fun. I think it was worth it.  To wash off the mud and who knows what else of off my legs and hands Pete and I decided to give Sandeep his second swimming in the lake. There is a really nice place to swim a little down the lake. Sandeep is not the best swimmer, he has potential and he wants us to teach him to swim before we leave. Right now he knows the strokes but sinks slowly as he strokes and can't breathe. Practice, practice, and more practice.   As I have said before we have made a good friend here in Pokhara, Sandeep, he is the nephew of the 3 Sisters and is here in Pokhara to help out with construction and to go through some of the trekking guide training too. He and the sisters are originally from Darjeeling in the Sikkim region in north eastern India (where they are pretty much Nepalize living in India) Sandeep has graduated from the first level of mountaineering training offered at the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute in Darjeeling, India. This is an intensive month long training in skill necessary to climb and guide expeditions in to the neither regions of the Himalayan (and other huge) mountains. This school was founded by the late Tenzing Norgay (You know the Sherpa who climbed with Sir Edmond Hillary in the first expedition to reach the summit of Everest) and the instructors have are all Everesters. I have decided that this is a necessary part of my future education, it costs five hundred US dollars for the training with everything included: gear, food, housing, and an attempt on a mountain around five to six thousand meters in India. I'm all about it, and your coming with me Dan! (Anyone else is welcome but for Dan it is compulsory). After completing this I hope to spend a couple months trekking around the Annapurna Conservation Area Project probably with some of the guides I am training now and finish it all up by trying to climb one of the over six thousand meter peaks in either the Annapurna or Mustang region near the Tibetan plateau. Sandeep and Lucky have both expressed an interest in climbing one of these mountains with us.   There are all of the major things. Class is going well; we are going to have out first test on Friday to see how much the girls are retaining. Pete and I have also been preparing lesson plans for the advanced guide training we will be helping with in the beginning of July. We will be teaching on eco-tourism, leadership, Leave no Trace, knots, first aid, and proper ways to use equipment. We were also asked if we would teach an English class in downtown Pokhara to over twenty to thirty people, we politely declined. Pete and I both feel this would be out of our level of skill and don't really have the time to devote to it. Our research has begun too, we have managed to talk with a handful of people about the impact tourism and trekking has had on their life. We have gotten stories of mixed blessings. Our health is doing much better now and the monsoon is in season. It rains everyday for varying amounts of time and with varying ferocities.   How is life going where you are? Is the summer treating you well?  Well it is time to go watch the evening Hindi soap opera.   Steve (Pete is already absorbed in the soap)  Some personal notes…  Bidhata – Mafgarnuos, Ma ekdum naramro bidarthi ra bhaai huna chhu. Mo abbo Englishmaa lekhnachhu. I am enjoying being an English guru. Mero bidarthi haru classmaa fun hau. Lately Peteji ra ma have been working on hamro lesson plans for teaching. I have also taken to afternoonmaa padhdaichhu ra sutdaichhu.    Laura L. – How is your summer going? How is the little spiked beast?  Dad – How is the truck working out? What are you going to put on the back? Are you going to help me move to college this year?     Uncle Sam & Chris – How was Haiti?  Ken G. – I hope you enjoyed the Adirondacks and get that visa. We have to go down and get our visa extensions soon.   Joanna – How does James like Perdue? Was the ride out a good time?  Marcus – It is important to remember that India has a different caste system then Nepal. Much of the music is like the Indian Hindi music (or I just can't tell the two apart, as they play a lot of Hindi music on the radio) I am planning to bring a nice stash of music home. There are no copyright laws here so CDs are really cheap.

      6/15/03 Namaste, Tapaailaai kasto chha? ("you to how are?")  When you think you have been somewhere long enough to have an understanding as to how life is, something always happens to tell you that you know very little about how life is and for that matter, will ever know. The computer I am sitting at is behind the counter in the front of the 3 Sisters office/guesthouse. There is a large glass window that looks out over the porch to the road and the lake behind it. Yesterday I was working on a lesson plan for today, my first English class. Who would have thought that I would be teaching English? Me, who has for year dreaded taking any English classes, having failed English in college three years ago. Well I have been appointed the "expert" in this language that I've never really enjoyed, but I am a "native speaker" so I must be good at it. The plan is that six days a week Pete and I will teach a two-hour class on English to four or more girls with various degrees of English skill.   In mid morning there was a regular flow of men taking goats down the road to the right of the guesthouse. Many went by, I do not know how many but probably 30-40 or more. About two hours later they came back carrying them between two men or women but all of the goats had no heads… I guess there was a Hindu festival puja (worship) yesterday that only happens once every 5 years. Hinduism is the major religion of this country that proclaims it's self "the only Hindu Kingdom in the world". Hinduism is very apparent in everyday life, most prevalently in the tika, a mark of red, white, or other combinations place in the middle of the forehead. Hinduism it seams is similar to the ancient Greek pantheon of gods of which there are over 3,000,000 gods, which tend to have hundreds of manifestation and incarnations. The actual religious practices very from family to family with the worshiping of a god who they prefer on a daily basis, with small shrines usually built into the highs part of the house where they prey, ring a bell and have many images that they worship and place tika and other makeup onto those images. The other major piece of Hinduism is the caste system, made up of four major groups: Brahmins, or the priest caste, Chhetris, warriors and rulers, Vaisyas, merchants, and the Sudras, the occupational caste. With the Harijans who are outside of the caste system and deemed 'untouchable' who are allowed to do only the most menial tasks. It is actually much more complicated then this, but I am kind of confused when I ask more details so I will accept my knowledge as is. Castes by law were officially removed, but they are still a major factor of life as far as jobs and education. Ones caste is shown by their sir names. So far we have been staying with Chhetris, our family during our Nepali classes was Khatri Chherti a sub group of Chherti and now we are staying with the Chherti sisters. Both have been relatively well off families in good economic standing given that they are Nepal. Another distinguishing factor is Brahmin and Chherti women wear a stud in their left nostril (often gold) as a symbol of their status. I have found it is not uncommon to see 3 and 4 year olds with their noses pierced. It is also common for women of Newar, an ethnic group to have the septum of their noses pierced as well I am unsure what this means as I have not had. Many women also have either a sindur, red make-up along the part of their hair or a bidi, a dot between the eyebrows, it could be red, another color, or even jeweled with intricate designs. Ok I'm done with my small educational moment.   It is now Monday and I must say Sunday was very busy, first major event was that we lost power for most of the day, in fact in the middle of when I was typing this e-mail. That is why I didn’t finish this yesterday.  Yesterday we had our first English class, there are three girls, Nirma 23 with a fair English skill already, Santi 22, who has the worst English of the three, but still knows more then I know in Nepali, and Chunta 24, who has the best English of them all, but is very shy to speak. Class went well as far as getting to know how much they know and what they need most. We will be able to prepare a better class our next class.  Yesterday Lucky, Nicky, and Lisa arrived from being delayed by a conflict between the army and the Maoists. The army did not allow them to use the road between where they were in Pokhara (sorry I forgot exactly where they were then but they were in the Upper Mustang region near Tibet) until the next day. They are an interesting bunch. Three mid 40s unmarried women, it is fun to listen to them talk even though I understand very little of what they are saying, they talk rather fast. They are very interested for us to share with them about many things like: knots, camp craft, Leave no Trace, eco-tourism, the western idea of "adventure", and of course English among other things.   After a small chat with Lucky, Dicky, Nicky, and Lisa, Pete went to work on construction and I went for a walk around the lake to see if I could see the elusive mountains. I couldn't, but I still got some really great photos of the sun shining on the water and had a lot of fun walking in the rice fields. Rice fields are rather interesting to walk through. If you don't want to get wet, and leeches you have to balance on the thin walls that separate the terraces of the different fields. It ends up being kind of maze like as you have to decide which paths to take, some of them are very slippery or sink in to the fields and are best avoided.    A quick side note… I still get a good kick when the yaks which wonder around freely grazing, walk by, there was just a herd of maybe 20 yaks that came down the road and wend down to the lake for a swim to cool off. For being slightly larger then a cow they can swim rather well. There are also the naked little boys and girls playing in the mud pits of the rice field. They are rather cute. One boy is trying to ride one of the swimming yaks but doesn't last too long before they buck him off.  When Pete and Sandeep (the sister's nephew) finished working on the construction for the day. Sandeep who is our age, talked us into teaching him how to swim. He had a pretty good idea of what he we doing but still had not refined his strokes to where he could swim much farther then 8-10 meters. It was quite nice to go swimming and get out of the heat. It has been around 31 degrees Celsius with the humidity through the roof. You can sweat standing still.    This morning after breakfast we talked with Lucky about training and how it was going to run, it sounds like we will be able to go out in to the hills around and have some practical in the field teaching time. Yay, we are going to get some trekking time in!   Class was good today; we went over the simple present tense and present continuous. I think I'm going to learn a lot about how English works, things that I just take for granted because they just sound right. We also got a fourth student Lia who is much worse then the other girls I think she may even be illiterate in Nepali so I think she may need more tutoring. We have been promised that more girls are coming, I see splitting them up into two classes, one class for beginners and one for the girls with an ok grasp of English.  I've just gone over the two page mark so I'm going to wrap this up even though I have long list of things I want to tell you, I'll have to get to them next time. But a few little things… I have shaved my face (ahhh bald face) it was just too hot with a beard. As it turns out I didn't have a viral infection either, I had giardia or another similar protozoa. I took the medication I had brought with me just incase and feeling as good a new. I think the good thing about being sick is you really appreciate it when you feel better. I have had requests for past newsletters, I am going to compile all of the letters thus far into a Word document, if you would like a copy tell me and I will send it to you. Enough for now.  Steve (and Pete again diligently working on building.  Some personal notes…  Ken S. – The lake scene is very beautiful, and is a source of daily inspiration of God's creations.  Mom – Enjoy Cape Cod, don't get too sun burned and I can't wait to hear about it.  Laura B. – The milk tea is a sweet tea made with milk and tea. They do have western teas available, but I prefer the local tea.  Tyson – I'm sure Pete is learning many lesson (but I think he is already has a degree in engineering. =)  Callie and Katy – I got your letters (only one) today, thank you so much for writing, I will write back shortly.

      12/6/03 Namaste, We are in Pokhara now, what a great change from the craziness of Kathmandu. To make it even better we are in northern lakeside, away from downtown Pokhara. There is no pollution like in Kathmandu where it was common to see people with masks on the streets. It is quite, and peaceful. In fact from where I sit now typing this letter I have a beautiful view of some soon to be rice fields leading down to Phewa Tal (a lake) with a nice "hill" that is 1500m high with a Buddhist monastery on top and a couple houses built in to the side on the other bank of the lake. The lake is maybe as wide a Skinny-atlas lake (you get it, and I can't spell it) but is not as long and kinda looks like a comma, we are up on the circle part of the comma. A couple Dunga's (small wooden boats similar to canoes, painted red, blue, and yellow) dot the lake with their respective fishermen trying to get fish to sell at the market. The lack is calm, with no motors to be seen on it, crystalline smooth. Right now (Friday morning) there are three young boys playing/working in the rice fields, cleaning the boggy field and throwing mud at each other. A couple yaks also wonder around the small fields looking for some grass to eat and cooling off in the mud. For those of you who have not seen rice fields they are (here at least) small areas that are sectioned off with small walls of earth, about six inch high built around them and then flooded with water to make a good place for the rice to grow. To keep them level they are built in tiers from the road down to the lake, water flows from the upper field to the lower ones through small openings in the walls. Yesterday I decided to walk along the walls down to the waterfront to take photos of the lake and of the yaks bathing in the mud, the view after the rain was very nice.   From where we are you can not see the mountains but on a clear day we will go down into town where you can see Annapurna at 8091m, Machhapuchhare 6993m and the entire Annapurna range which has 4 major summits. The view I have seen from the photos is quite captivating. Annapurna is on of the 14 mountains in the world over 8000m. I have been reading that fewer people have reached the summit of Annapurna then any other 8000m mountain, and just to climb it each group (up to 7 people) has to pay US$10,000 just to give it a try. One of my older books says as of 1993 only 93 people had reached the summit and 45 people had died in the many attempts since the first time it was climbed in 1950, by four Frenchmen who lost most of their fingers and toes in the process to become the first men to climb a mountain over 8000m. My what a history buff I've become… anyway, back to Pokhara.  The 3 Sisters have three buildings in Lakefront. The first is their old house, which before the construction of their guesthouse was also used as a guesthouse. Right now they are adding on to the house to create classrooms for their female guide-training program, I will talk more about the construction later. The second building is their guesthouse, which is very nice with a nice restaurant and rooms ranging from a dorm room for 200 rupees (less then US$3) to doubles with a private bath (US$12). Pete and I have been put up in one of the nice double rooms with a private bath, the lap of luxury. The best thing is we don't have to pay a dime; we just have to teach English and help out however we can. The third building is their women's hostel, Empowering Women of Nepal (EWN for short) where the girls we will be teaching are staying and where the classroom we will teach.  Classes will start on Sunday and some of the girls have started to come in from a one-week vacation. Right now two of the sisters are out on a trek (Lucky & Nicky) until Saturday, so we have only meet Dicky the third sister. They have 4 brothers some of which are up from India, where they live, to help with the construction so we are not the only males around.   Upon our arrival Dicky told us to relax and start planning our class for a few days. Pete seeing that he has to complete a certain number of hours for his internship felt he had to start working right away and has been helping out with the construction. He is getting a crash course in Asian construction using concrete, bricks, and bamboo it is quite interesting. He seems to be enjoying himself, but has managed to get a little sunburned (today he is equipped with sunscreen and a hat, so he should be fine). Today they are making the concrete pillars for the roof. In the mean time I have been starting to sift through the English teaching material they have here, preparing lessons, familiarizing myself with the workings of the business and where they offer trekking.  I have become a little frustrated with the realization that I will not be able to do much if any trekking. We have been promised that on a nice day we will be able to go on a short hike up to either Sarangkot the hill behind our guesthouse at 1592m or Kalabong the hill across the lake, both which have a nice view of the mountains and are at least a little climb. I'm hoping later I might convince the sisters that we should take a part of our class on a short (4-5 days) trek up to Poon Hill 3210m to get some in-the-field experience and on the spot teaching opportunities. Dan, I have decided, that we need to come back in the right season and climb Mardi Himal a small "trekking" 5587m peak near Machhapuchhare and hike up to the Annapurna sanctuary in the middle of the Annapurnas. I have planned this Dan, so start saving up! It will be around US$500 on top of airfare (US$1000 or so).  Everyday Starts with breakfast and tea in their house, lunch is around 1 in the afternoon, tea in the mid-afternoon, and dinner is around 7 at night after which we return to the guesthouse and watch the Nepali news with the guys before going back to our room for the night. I need to say that the Nepalize love their tea, there are two major kinds, dudh ciyah (milk tea) and kaalo ciyah (black tea). Both teas have lots of sugar (or at least I like to put a nice amount in and so do they). Tea is a 3-4 times a day thing, before breakfast, at breakfast, after breakfast, and again in the afternoon. I think I might be getting hooked on it, it is becoming part of everyday life.  So that is life so far. Pokhara is going to workout well, we are very well taken care of, but I will say that the didi's from Kathmandu are better cooks then bahini (younger sister) cooks here in Pokhara, but the food is still very good. We also have free Internet, but have to use it sparingly, signing on just to send out e-mail and typing offline.   I think I'm going to go read some more and thing about teaching, maybe study some Nepali too.  God bless and take care till I speak with you again.  Steve (Pete is building)  And some personal notes…  Bidhata - Mahph garnunos, ma dherai dherai naraamro bhaai chha. Ma nepalima bhanchhu. Pokhara dherai raamro chha. Malaai Pokhara mana paraauchhu taara, tapaaiko khaanaa raamro chha. Haamro kotaha raamro chha. Yahaa wahaa haru raamro chha. Dhanyabad laagi tapaaiko haanilaai maddata dinu hunchha. Ma tapaaiko gapha garnu haraaudai chhu. Tapaai paribaaralaai namaste bhannu hunchha.  Dan M – I was wondering how you were doing… It took me about 3-4 weeks to get my road test too. I hope you are enjoying riding and my bike is treating you well. The bike must be back, and running by Aug. 20th. I come back the 21st and need to go strait to school that day.  Katy – Will do, it is a deal (I was gonna get you something anyway…). I also chatted with Jon a couple times last semester too, that is cool he is going to be around some.  Ken S – Yes, I can write, but I think the difference is here I am just telling a story and in a very conversational style not an essay, or a report. It is very relaxed and I just let it flow from me.   Joanna – There is no grade for our Nepali class, the test was to see how much we have learned. (8 weeks of classes if we took them at a regular pace. The food seems simple enough to make, but is a very different style then in the US. I have every intention of sitting in on some of the cooking and plan to buy a book or two one Nepali cooking. I think I will also bring home some spices too as it is somewhat hard to find the spices in the states and much cheaper here. Sweet potato anything has to be one of my favorite dishes, and with a nice chunk of my family being good southerners I get a good pie/casserole when I go down there for Christmas and other holidays.

      11/6/03 Namaste Form Nepal, Well, well, well, lots has happened since I last typed to you… and now I will tell you, this should be a pretty nice sized letter… so I apologize in advance if it is too long.  Well, class finished on Sunday, with an exam, but before that, on Friday I thing was toulo didi's and the 3rd sister, who doesn't live with the family anymore, her birthday. To say the least it was another huge party, does it sound like this family knows how to throw a party?? Oh my goodness this was a good one, the food was amazing and so are the relatives! First the important thing... Food, first vegetable pakhora (dumplings, kinda, not to be confused with Pokhara, the city where we are now) yum yum, then the best rice ("bhaat") with panner (a kind of cheese) curry. Let me tell you, it was fab. With the food came the family and their uncle ("mama" for maternal uncle) who is a very good man and an excellent contact to boot. He is a major high up in one of the major NGO's of Nepal and the entire Hindu coast (Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan strange how some of these are not Hindu countries… but whatever) the Alliance for Social Mobilization. We talked (Pete more then me, as I was talking with a brother-in-law) Nepal, development, and eco-tourism and how it has been chosen for one of the primary means of development for the area, etc, etc.   Lately governmental instability has greatly damaged the tourism of Nepal. The fighting between the Maoists, the parliament, and the king including the massacre of the royal family two years ago which was pretty much the beginning of all the trouble. On Friday (or maybe it was Thursday) there was a protest, by many of the students, which lead to the schools being shut down for a day, and soldiers on most major roads. There is nothing like the guys in cammo with big automatic weapons everywhere.   Here I think I should tell you that I already typed this letter, more or less last week (sometime, it all mushes together) so apologize again, but I'm sure it is not as good as it was then. As I was wrapping it up, the 5th thunderstorm for the day kicked the power out and… well I lost an hour’s worth of work. I was a little erked, but they didn't make me pay full price at the Internet house. I told myself I would re-type it on Saturday morning, but my body had a different plan, I woke up dizzy and weak, with a fever, some of the dreaded "D" word (dun dun dun DADUN) and a head full yicky green stuff. Every time I got up I got very light headed and I had to go up to the toilet pretty regularly so this was not a very comfortable situation. So Pete went to church with out me and got to watch a baptism, and I guess the whole morning was a bit of a fiasco, you'll have to ask him.   After my fever got up to 101 in the afternoon I decided it was time to think about going to the doctors. One small problem… it was Saturday, the weekly holiday, and it was closed, go figure, hospitals that close, who knew. So I took some Tylenol, to bring the fever down and was confined to my bed, except to go to the toilet. Now I must say, in this state there are few who could care for me like toulo didi, a mother in her own right. She was going to make sure I had the best care possible; I was never without week tea, or a warm re-hydration mix to drink. She checked my temp, regularly and made be drink an herbal decongestant, which tasted REALLY nasty but did pretty good job at clearing up my head. It was weak dhal soup for the rest of the day for me.   That evening we were invited to another party, to say goodbye to us, as we were to leave on Monday. I clearly was not going, and Pete talked didi into letting him watch me so she could go be with her sisters. So it was Pete and I all evening. When everyone got back they had some really good food, but I was not allowed to eat any, even though my fever had gone down to 99 and I was no longer dizzy, mom's, gotta love 'em.   Sunday morning I was feeling much better, but I was told by didi, that I would not be able to go to the last class, which was an exam, I had to go to the hospital for a check up, I wasn't well yet. Pete would have to take the final test for the two of us. As I'm sure you can guess I was very let down over this, but… I got over it.   My trip to the doctors came to the conclusion that I have a viral infection. So after waiting for about a hour, paying the foreigner price of US$5 for a doctor's visit, and US$.50 for my medicine, I was off to go and start feeling better. We decided that because I was not all the way up to par, we would stay in Kathmandu for one more day instead of leaving right away the next morning. We went that afternoon and had one final meeting with our teacher to say goodbye, when she asked us to come again on Monday. The man from Scotland came by to talk with us and to help sano didi hook up a web cam to her computer. We chatted for a little while. He told us that there is no active malaria in Pokhara, and we did not need to take the mefliquine, there got $145 wasted on drugs. Then with a light meal of Daal Bhaat, it is off to bed early.  Monday, we packed, got out bus tickets, had one final meeting with our teacher, this time it was really final, and are you ready for this, were invited to a relative’s house for another party. The Nepalese family structure is amazing in how the have a very close-nit group and come together often to socialize. After another late evening we returned home and went to bed.  Up nice and early we left for the bus station at 6:30 in the morning. We took a nice ride to Pokhara, it took us until 3:30ish to arrive in Pokhara. Now I want to say something about the landscape of Nepal, Wow! Picture a drive from Syracuse to Albany, but the road, which is in good repair, has to wind around the sides of steep hillsides the whole way. There is little to no true "flatland" all of the hillsides are made terraced farm land, little strips of crops 4-10 feet wide cover most of the hillsides. This drive took about 7+ hours with a 1-hour lunch stop in the middle. There was a hairpin turn with shear drop offs about every 20 to 50 meters on the straighter parts. Oh it was beautiful. Getting away from the city proved to be worth it. When we arrived in Pokhara it was a breath of fresh air, literally, little to no pollution, no busy traffic with the filth and fumes of Kathmandu.   I am going to wrap up this letter now, we are in Pokhara and getting settled in at the 3 Sisters Adventure Trekking (P.) LTD. Http://www.3sistersadventure.com if you would like to get some info about the place. In the next letter I will describe more about where we are and what we are doing. This is long enough (at almost 2 pages in word). Thanks,  Steve (and Pete)  Some personal Notes…  Ruth – You would be tall, and I'm working on the photo thing.  Frank – Good to hear for the Swasty clan, gonna miss going to the lake this summer. I hope the "Old Guys" can keep it lively with out me. Although I do have a lake side view… I am missing riding the motorcycle… they have lots over here (maybe more then cars) but I don't think I'm going to be driving too much here, I fear for my life.  Nicora – Thanks, I love and miss you too.   Tyson – Glad your back to your old stomping grounds. I was just being a little sarcastic. Gotta keep you on your toes   Ken G. – Yeah this is a small world. Thank you for the sermon it was nice. It may take a little while before I can understand the ones I'm getting here.  Christine L. – It is "Nepali". Glad to hear your enjoying you time home in Germany.  Mom – Yes I stopped taking the Mef. and can sleep again.    Esther – Got it, and where is Chris now and Sam going?  Bidhata – Welcome to the newsletter, and we made it to Pokhara, thanks for all of the hospitality and help, see you in a couple months on our way back through Kathmandu.

      Soooo in a mad rush to avoid the stick from didi("older sister") I didn't get to finish my letter. I got up extra early just to come down and finish it up. The huge thunderstorm at 3am also helped to get me up. I think monsoon has started; the forecast is rain everyday for the next week.  Last night my family ("mero padiwaar") had one of the gentlemen who stayed there while he was learning Nepali, seven years ago. He is from Scotland and is a physician at the local hospital in Patan. It was convenient timing, I to say the least have been having some really disturbing dreams from the meflquine I've been taking. Waking up 15 min. after falling asleep all shook up, bad, bad dreams... he said in Kathmandu I don't need any, and he doesn't think I'll need any in Pokhara either, but is going to check, and if I do I'm going to get a different anti-malarial without the gnarly side affects. (Mom, Dad, I'm being smart about it, don't worry). Also I've enjoyed all the AIM chatting I get while I'm making these e-mails. For those who don't know my AIM name is Monocheli feel free to drop me a line if you see me, I'll tell you if I'm busy. Steve (Pete is still sleeping) P.s. some personal notes... Khristine - glad to hear from you, now you are in my neck of the woods for school, I might have to come down and see you and parker some weekend when I get back to school. Mark T - Wait a month or two, till it is as good as new. Mike O - We have not seen anything major about the Everest thing, just new and banners. Tyson - We will be good students and be diligent (we have you as an example right?) and that is about our whole budget. Dad - Glad to hear Megan is ok. RPCteens - I'm weird am I? Tim - rain, yes! Trading art is the best way to do it, and I'll trade you a boom box for my CD's :) Katy W - I look forward to it in a month or so, when it gets here. Joanna B - Nepali is written in a script derived from Sanskrit, but we are learning a romanized version so we can read it. I have only heard of one accident and no one was hurt bad just banged up, it was a bicycle to motorcycle accident. The money is paper and coins, but coins are rare and worth pennies. Nepali's hold cows as sacred, the can do what ever they want, wonder free, this is true for all Hindus. We are getting college credit for this, but I was thinking it would be nice to get Language credit too.

      3/6/03 "It doesn't translate well…" I don't know how many times we have heard that on in the last week... But this is what makes it interesting. I have decided that this and all future e-mails will be in "Nepali Vision!" and that means for the uneducated that when you see some gibberish word in ( ) it is Nepali for the word right before it.   Weather Update:  The rain is coming, or has it gotten here? It has rained every day for the last three days. It POURS for half-an-hour or soo, then everything is dry again in like 30 sec. (ok 20-30min. but it seems that fast).    I neglected to say where we are right now in the last letter... so we are in suburbs of Kathmandu. If you can get your hands ("haat") on a good map of Kathmandu, we are living in Satobato at the K.C. family's house("ghar"). Every day we commute to Kopundol for two hours of Nepali classes. Both places are in Patan to the south east of central Kathmandu. Before we were at a hotel in Thamel, which is tourist central, northwest Kathmandu.   Yesterday we went out with saano didi("little, big sister") took Pete and I to the market in Jawlakhel so we could buy umbrellas, and I could get a couple cool shirts (I only had 2 before and washing one a day was getting old...) and an eraser I have successfully used the one on my pencil("sisaakalam"). The market was quite fun but I think I'm too big for Nepal, I had to try 6-7 shirts before I could find one that even fit on me, and it was the largest size anyone had.    To continue with the size subject Pete and I are giants, or yeti maybe. I have not seen a single Nepali who is taller then 5'8" and most are around 5' to 5'4" (Krissy you would fit in perfect!). to follow this note, nothing is made the right size for us examples: doorways, clothes, flip-flops, chairs("mech"), tables("tebul"), beds (pete's), the ceilings of tempos, in which we have to hunch over in to fit (ok, so every now and then a tempo has a high ceiling and we can sit upright and some door ways are full size but it sure feels like it is all the time and I have gotten a good couple whacks on the noggin).    After shopping it was pretty much strait to class. mid-ride there it started to rain, are we surprised? No, and someone who will remain nameless, decided not to bring his brand new umbrella, and it wasn't me. So I had a soggy classmate as we("haami") learned the names of fruits, and more on verb conjugation, which changes depending on the status of who you are talking to. There are three different ways to say "you"("ta, timi, tapaai") each with a different status attached to them, with a different verb conjugation, at least it is the same for all except "hunu". Mom, your gonna love this too, after all those years of bring me up, I'm learning how to play with my food by eating with my hand, and to not say "thank you" after everything, the Nepalize just don't say it, they show it with a nod or a smile.    Speaking of food!("bhaat" which also means "rice") (Yay cullies!) Food, has been good, the staple of dal bhaat thakari (beans, rice and veggies) twice a day is working out great, the thakari changes every meal, potato(aloo), greens(saag), radish(I forgot), Jackfruit(forgot too, bad student, "naramro bidayrti") and even bean curd too! And the didi's push food like you wouldn't believe (Pete the soft spoken one can't refuse either). So no worries here.   ohhh I gotta go or I've been promised a beating from saano didi. I'll reply to you e-mails next time.   Thanks for continued prayer and keeping in-touch, I enjoy reading all the e-mails (a bit of home sickness has hit) and miss you all very much.   Steve (Pete is over my shoulder)

      1/6/03 Namaste, (a Nepalize greeting)   Well it has been a bit so this promises to be a healthy e-mail, are you ready....   As I left you we were going to see a Nepali teacher, it turns out, she (Nirmalaa) is great! We started that day. (Although she was a little bit pricier then expected, but we will cope, she is worth it) It is 30,000 Nepalize rupees (72 rupees for US$1, I did it once and my brain isn't working now, so you can figure it out) for 2 weeks of class and home stays (food included) with a Nepali family. The family we are staying with has dad (baa), two daughters. The older (thulo didi) is 35 and has her two daughters (they don't talk much but are both in grade school and their dad is in NYC making money for an undetermined amount of time) the younger (saano didi) is 25 and unmarried, she speaks very good English and is being a great help in practicing Nepali. We will be here will the 9th of jun. the day after our last day of classes with Nirmalaa.    We are spending 2 hour a day with Nirmalaa to learn concepts and study pretty much every other waking hour (ok we take brakes to eat, and some other things) This is very hard work, whoohoo don't think (and people at PSC don't get offended) I've studied this hard in years. We get 20-30 vocabulary words a day on top of grammar. The grammar is also very different; I'm slowly starting to warp my brain to think in a different word order. Oh and a little side note the word for "to be/is" "hunu" has 36 different conjugations, that are used for different subject and different sentence structures (this one I still am having struggles with). But learning is going well, and my brain hurts, it is a good thing we have two+ months to absorb and practice all we are learning.    I had a thought... I think PSC should offer overseas language credits like I can come here for a couple months and get my 6 credits (hint hint)   Yesterday we had off, Saturday is the day used for worship here, we went with Nirmalaa our teacher, she is a Christian. Church was good (except it was in Nepali so I got only choice words every now and then, but I did get "Daynibhaad Hajus Khist" which means "thank you Jesus Christ"). After church we went to Dr. Khatry's house for dinner. Dr Khatry is a Nepalize theological scholar; we talked for a few hours about Christians in Nepal and their struggles with the government before going back our ghar (home) for the night.    Oh I might give you some info on how we are getting around... public transportation! Just say no to taxis, they are over 10 times the price, not to mention they try to give you the "foreigner price" which is even more. We have successful figured out how to get in a tempo which I have dubbed "the three wheeled wonder" which they pack with 12 people and scoot around the city in a madding fray of traffic. For those of us who are used to western driving, just throw all of those concepts right out the window, "lines? What are those for??" everybody tries to get there as fast as possible by what ever means, motorcycles dart in and out everywhere (I think there are more moto's then cars, or busses) busses pass busses in oncoming traffic, and then stop in the middle of traffic to pick up another passenger. For the Senegal folk, I think this is a step up on the craziness ladder. Oh and don't forget the cows that wonder where ever they want, we even saw an elephant walking down the street (Mel, I thought you might like that). We also managed to get lost a couple more times too in our trips around town, missing stops, etc. but the Nepalize are great, just find one who speaks English and he/she will tell you exactly where you need to go (if he knows, other wise he tells you something to make you feel better).   The weather is hot, 30C is pretty regular, and it is staring to rain everyday a little too. The rain is coming.   One last thing before I do some personal notes... we have meet a lady who is doing something amazing, she would like me to not say her name so she will not be known that she is doing this. 5 years ago she went with a missions trip India and started a church near a red light district where girls are sold in to prostitution. They have started to bring the girls who are allowed to leave (after 5 years of being a prostitute) in to Nepal and keep them in heirs and another home that she has bought. She is working to cure them of the STD's they have (those that are curable), to teach them trades, real schooling, and to start a new life where their lives before are unknown. Right now there are 32 girls of different ages with 12 children under her care. Right now they are being given money for schooling from others, but if any of you have it on your heart to help out it would be greatly appreciated. I will get information on how to do that to you, just ask.    So, as you can see Nepali is getting in to my head and we are working hard, learning, and growing much.    On a personal note...   Cameron - Good Good, just you better be there! :)   Eric H - Pete will be a good student; I'll make sure he does his homework.   Tyson - Nope, we are defiantly not getting paid (if you know anyone who would like to, that would be great.)   Mike - Sorry I didn't get the photos (dial up... yeah)   Krissy - I miss you bunches, too.   Carol L - 2 things, Get to work! (I had to :) and I feel you completely.   Ian - you have all summer, RUN, RUN, RUN!   Joanna - Curry does change, but I think this is modeled after the traditional Indian curry, Sorry I will not be able to send any photo's over e-mail. And, I think it means that even though it is raining the water will be put to good use.   Miguel - we can see mountains in every direction.   Mom - the leg is as good a new, with just a little scab to show for it.   Thank you everyone for the continued thoughts and prayers, please also pray for the girls. I'll get back to you later.    Steve (and Pete)

      25-7-03 Namaste A lot of things have changed since last week. It feels like I am in a totally different place, well ok, not totally different, just kinda different. Sunday Sandeep told Pete and I that he was leaving Monday to go back home to Darjeeling. Pete and I have not been looking forward to this time; Sandeep was the only Nepalize man our age in our social circle (or should I say in the family) and our best friend here in Pokhara. As it turned out he didn't leave till Tuesday but all the same he has left us. It is just not the same without him; the three amigos are disbanded, for now. Monday night we took Sandeep out for a good dinner on the town and one of the better restaurants that served non-Asian food. Which was what he wanted. I think it is rather interesting to think of lasagna as a foreign food, but it is for Sandeep and we wanted to treat him to something special for his last night with us. Pete and I both ordered Indian food (kofta and korma with rice, naan, and lassis) while Sandeep got spinach lasagna with bershetta (spelled that one wrong and spellchecker was no help) as an appetizer. I have always been rather skeptical about getting foreign style food for the place where I am staying (i.e. western style food in the east, etc.) as it usually has a rather bizarre flavor from what I'm used to at home, but this was an exemplary sample of western style lasagna and was really tasty. He really enjoyed the treat. He had asked us to pick out one of our favorite dishes from the US that we really like to eat at home. Both Pete and I agreed that good veggie lasagna was one of our favorites (Hint, hint all cullies). All of the food was very good. Sandeep was rather surprised when the waiter brought out the tray holding his food and it was only six inches square and an inch deep. But Sandeep, who has lived of a solid eastern diet consisting mostly of rice with little cheese, was completely floored by the density of lasagna and could only eat half of his food before he was completely full and has to just sit and digest for a few minutes. At a little under two dollars it was one of the best lasagna I've had. The whole meal for three of us was around ten dollars for everything.  Around ten o'clock we started the walk back to the guesthouse. Shortly there after the power went out as we were walking down the main drag. I love it when the power goes out and I'm not on the computer. The stars leap out and everyone brings out candles, two wonderful things that have been lost since the development of the electric light, which has been deemed "better" and easier. The street has a whole different feel without the florescent streetlights that are on constantly. It also adds a bit of danger/excitement as probability of stepping in one of the very dangerous mines that dot the road and sidewalks is much higher when you can't see them.  These mines are carefully set by all of the local cows and buffalo on a daily basis to insure freshness. (The fact that I am reading "The Killing Fields" doesn't help my imagination any, does it?) On our walk home we saw the best shooting star I have ever seen. It was very large and green with a very clear tail. Thankfully we managed to get back to the guesthouse unscathed. Someone was watching over us that night.  We convinced Sandeep come sit up on the roof of the guesthouse to watch the stars and play his guitar for us. His guitar is quite the piece of work, with tape holding together all of the seams and a habit to loose tune in the middle of every song. We sat and talked for a little while we watch the stars and listened to him play. He played some of his favorite English and Nepali song for us. He is a really big fan of western bands like Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Guns 'n Roses, The Scorpions, and Led Zeppelin. He played with the skills of someone who has been playing for years. Given the condition of his guitar I found this rather impressive. It makes me think about how here in Nepal (and many other places) how someone may have an amazing skill but they will never be recognized for it. Admitting I think Sandeep would need a far amount of practice before he was good enough for that. Think about how many famous musicians, movie stars, or artist you know from India, the second most populous country in the world? This brings up the whole thoughts about the unbalance of this world of ours but I don't want to go there now. You think about it and get back to me. I think I tend to have a rather personalized and skewed perspective on this issue. We sat on the roof for quite sometime before calling it a night. The next day we said goodbye as he and some of the aunts and uncles left to go back to Darjeeling. He is and will continue to be missed. Maybe if someday he is privileged enough to get a visa I can show him my home, my mountains, and my favorite places to go, but US visas are very hard to come by. This makes me sad.   Now in the house the three older brothers are the only men left. One is never around, one rarely speaks, and the oldest can't really speak (although he is fun and always smiling even though he has something wrong with his head so he can't speak). The women of the house are fasting this month; I think for lord shiva. So they are not eating regular meals. That leaves Pete and I pretty much to ourselves. Meals have become usually just us with the oldest brother who tells good stories with his hands but is not much of real conversation. Pete has been working like a fiend, putting in around eleven hours a day to fulfill his required internship hours. This has kept him rather busy, but I see he is emotionally ready to go home and see family and friends now that Sandeep is gone. My feelings are rather close to his except I, albeit a little lonely, still love where we are. The guesthouse bicycle has become my new best friend.  I had not really used the bicycle until after Sandeep left because there is only one that works. I guess "works" is a rather flexible statement in regards to this bicycle. It is a single speed, Indian made wonder (wonder that it works). The breaks work, a major plus, but the seat leaves something to be desired. It is stuck at the lowest possible setting and has a tendency to tilt back a little every time you go over a bump (there are a lot of those) until you can't really sit on it and have to hit is a couple times to put it back where it belongs. Doing this without stopping is quite an acrobatic feat but I think I have it down. Yesterday I got rather frustrated at the seat and jury-rigged it with some string so it doesn't tilt any more. My rear says "ahhhhhhh!" I also never realized how much I took having different gears. What I wouldn't to for my 21 speed right now. Both Wednesday and Thursday I went for a ride up to Mahendra Pul on the bike. It is about a forty-five minute ride there (up hill) and a fifteen-minute ride back. It is a rather nice ride with little traffic until you get close to the bazaar where it gets really crazy and you are reminded that you are in one of Nepal's largest cities (the atlas says between 50,000 and 100,000 people). It is no Kathmandu but it is still quite the adrenalin rush as you dodge in and out of cars, tractors, motorcycles, other bicycles, pedestrians, cows, and the heart stopping TATA trucks. The driving rules are very different then in the states, but they seem to work rather well. First the right of way is given to the biggest and fastest thing on the road (TATA) and the smaller you are you just avoid everything that is larger then you. This put me pretty close to the bottom of the totem. Everyone honks, rings a bell, bangs on something or whistles as they get close to you so you know they are there. My bike is missing a bell so I have to whistle. The roads down by the guesthouse are about two cars wide. The roads get wider as you approach the bazaar where they are about five cars wide. There are no lanes you drive wherever you fit. The slower vehicles tend to stay to the left side (you drive on the left side here), while faster cars pass in the middle or other side (at oncoming traffic). It is common practice to give about 4 inches of space between vehicles (including bikes) this is taking a little bit of getting used to. In Pokhara I have yet to see a stop sign or a stoplight. All of the intersections are like a mini circle. Everyone drives right in and goes around a central object till they get to the road they want. Stopping is not a wise choice of action; no one does, except for cows. It is more a skill of timing and faith in the fact that everyone looks out for each other. It is really quite amazing. All traffic slows for the entering traffic, so unless there is a TATA coming just plunge in. You don't mess with the TATAs. They come in either the bus or truck models and both are big and scary (think of a cross between a dump truck and a school bus). I recommend giving them as wide a berth as possible.   The bike has really opened up Pokhara I've been going all around town exploring for an hour or so before breakfast and again in the evening after I've finished working. I really enjoy a trip to town to get a lassi after a day of sitting at the computer working on a lesson plan.   Pete and I have also caved into the temptations of the ice cream man… A big no no, according to every guidebook I have ever read. This is due to the risk of the dairy spending too much time outside of refrigeration and developing unfriendly bacteria. Everyday the ice cream (klufi, a kind of custard nut frozen goodness) man roles his small two-wheeled cart down the street. This is a rather interesting story. We had seen him since day one in Pokhara, when Pete and I said no to each other in regards to having ice cream. As it turns out the ice cream man is a guide in the on season and he came to our training. I'm sure you can see my surprise. ("Pete, is that the ice cream man? Are we teaching The ice cream man???") It gets better… We later find out he is the husband of Mina one of our English students. So he would always wave and say hello to us every time he went by. In the middle of the day if it is not raining (and sometimes when it is) it is oppressively hot. It was not long before the heat, my salivation, smiles from happy customers and the constant reminder as he rolled by and wave got the better of be and I decided (and convinced Pete) that our stomachs had toughened up enough to handle one of the five rupee ice creams. It was as if heaven had come down to earth and touched down on my tongue, until it melted. But it was still worth every one of those 5 rupees I had spent on it. I justify it because it is directly supporting one of my student's families, and they have a cute little son they are sending to boarding school (the government schools are not so hot). "So if I buy this ice cream I am doing my part to help the Nepalize people." Now my conscious can rest at ease.    Pete has been working on drawing and designing a brochure for EWN. He is a really talented drawer. When he is finished with the drawings I am going to scan them in to Adobe Photoshop and add the text to make it all pretty. It will be really refreshing to do some fun work instead of writing.   Teaching continues to be one of the highlights of our days. All of the girls are really fun and have some of the best laughs we have heard for awhile. We have also been giving them homework that ends up teaching us about Nepal, their lives and other fun subjects. Even though they don't realize it they are also teaching us. They all laugh when we slip into Nepali in class; we told them they couldn't unless they were explaining the meaning of a word.   We have three weeks left of teaching and before we have to pack up and return to Kathmandu to visit some friends on our way back to the states. We haven't really figured out what we are going to do in Kathmandu yet, but we have three weeks, and forethought is rather underrated in Nepal. Pete and I have unanimously decided in an effort to save money (the bank is getting a little tight for both of us) that we will spend our overnight in Bangkok in the airport to avoid paying the fifteen dollar airport tax and a hotel bill for just fourteen hours in Thailand. We should stay up anyway to help us readjust to New York time anyway, right? Who needs sleep! I'll sleep when I get home.  See you soon (or latter)  Steve   On a personal note…  Tony - I guess you haven't checked your e-mail for a while and just got a mailbox full of them. I hope you enjoyed them; they are not the best as far as quality I think but more just thoughts and history. I look forward to your feedback. I told Pete.  Uncle Bob - Thanks for the flattery. I will defiantly bring home my Daura Suruwal to show everyone. I guess if I add a black western jacket to that I am in proper formal attire, ready to go and speak with the king. Dad said the reunion went well; I missed all of you and the goodness of the home cooking from all of the family. Next year I should be around. I'm sure I'll see you around before long.   Miguel - Elephants, well my guess would be at least a few lax rupees (a lax is 100,000) for sure, but you might get one a little cheaper if you barter really hard. Actually I have no Idea. But I do think they come with a carriage, not a saddle. Where are you again? Are you out in Cali now?  Mom - Hmmmm, those photo prices kinda hurt, but man it takes a long time to scan photos… oh well figure it out later. I don't really mind if your not going to be around, I'm sure I'm not really going to be around. I will be exhausted and busy so it is more of a relief because I have one less thing to do. I got some Nepali folk music I think you will like. And I think you should give me a couple weeks to get settled in before you come up. The first week is all training and after that the first week promises to be rather busy readjusting schedules and all. After that I look forward to seeing you. Make sure to talk to dad and plan your time accordingly.  Aunt Frances – I have been told and read how the boundary of Bangladesh has really hurt many of the Bengali people living around there (I'm sure you have first hand knowledge of this). Teaching is something I am interested in, but I have no formal education in teaching, just personal experience. I think when I return to the states I would be very interested in looking in to the schools you have mentioned, what kind of schools are they? Darjeeling has particular appeal, because I know someone there and it is in the mountains. I am also thinking I may look in to a school in Chittagong that my friend mom started. How does housing and visas go? Is there pay or do I have to pay my loan off before I go? Who do I contact and how? Any information would be great and I'll start looking in to it when I get home. I have one more year of school before I'm free and mom made me promise I would finish before I traveled again.  Katy – Thank you so much. That book I have heard about and everyone told me it was good. I've gotten into a really good habit of reading for pleasure everyday and have been plowing though books like never before. I can't wait to read it.

      21/7/03 Namaste, No major changes, we had or second English test yesterday, some of the girls did well, and some didn't. I think there is a major discrepancy in their studying tactics. Also, sad news that Sandeep is leaving tomorrow (Tuesday) for Darjeeling to see his family and friends. We will miss him deeply. There is something hard about saying goodbye when it is unsure you will ever see someone again and knowing that if you do it will be a long time before it happens, a very long time. But this is travel, right? You go somewhere get to know the people and places, and then you leave. Your time is finished. It is time to move on with life. When you get home everything is different. Styles have changed, places have changed, people have changed, people have moved, and you have changed. There comes a point I think when your home is not really your home anymore, or at least not the home you envision, the home of your youth. You come back and it feels foreign, and different. I guess that is when it is time to find and make a new home. But do you forget where you have been and where you came from? That would be a misfortune.   Well I just wanted to give a blurb before the personal notes and I got all sentimental. I guess I have been a rather heavy thinker as of late. But again life moves on, so enjoy it!  Steve  And as promised, Personal notes…   Bidhata - I agree Qayamat was not so good, but I laughed the whole way through anyway. I'm easily amused. I found a store where you can buy DVD's with 2 or 3 movies on each and got a few… Devdas is one, Shaki, Taal, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, Mohabbatein, Saathiya, Road, Company, Gadar, Border, The Hero, Kaante, Dil Chahta Hai, Lagaan, and one Nepali movie that I can't read. An added bonus is that most all of them on DVD have English subtitles, so I can understand them. Chalte Chalte I have not found yet plan to look more later. I'm glad to hear you are doing a show of your art, it is really good stuff and I enjoyed it greatly. How long will it be up? Will it be up till Pete and I come back to Kathmandu? I would love to see it (and maybe buy some). I really wanted to be an artist when I was younger and still really appreciate it.   Dan – How is all the bike stuff, did you get it all settled? And the BBMC patches are in, at a buck fifty each. But I'm sure I'm going to owe you more then that when I get home anyway. I was talking with Sandeep about when we return and we are going to look for places out west and in India that are not tourist hot spots so we can stay with villagers and not see tourist everywhere. Far away from the trekking and tourist places, way off the beaten track, oh it will be an adventure. I also think you should try to squeeze a BBMC logo on the bike if you do end up painting. I may have to have stickers made one of these days.    Frank – I'm sure you and Dad will do all right with the Ladies holding down the beach. The testosterone might be at an all time low, but hay, if your not all red blooded Polish man, I don't know who is. So you can make up for the disparity, I'm sure. I'm almost positive I have to work that weekend so you are right I will not be able to come out. Watch the sunset for me. And I got some Bollywood DVDs so you can enjoy them later if you want. Oh and thanks for getting my hard drive formatted.   Dad – How is the family doing? Are you planning on being around the day I come home?  Ian – always attracting the wrong kind of attention, eh? Are you saying I'm fat? What are we going to name the new ones this year? I think they should be TV names… Brad Pitt or something like that. I've avoided the leeches so far, but I was thinking, it might be nice to take one home as a pet… maybe not, they are kinda gross.  Ginny – Thank you for writing, I really do enjoy teaching. It is a service that I love to provide, but is very difficult when it is a subject you are not interested in or if your students are not interested in it. I'm sure I'll end up in some sort of teaching role, sharing what I have been privileged to learn with others. I think our capstone project will probably have very little of our trip, more theory and fact kind of stuff, not too much time for a history of our trip. But Pete and I have been thinking that this fall we will try to compile a slide show of our trip and see if we can get the ADK room one night and just talk about our trip and show photos for the benefit of friend and faculty who are interested in our trip. We will see.  Tom the L man – I hope you got a kick out of that toilet story too. That is one to tell the grand kids. I really hope the clown camp thing goes down, tell me as soon as possible so I can make sure to plan it in to my school schedule and tell my boss when I have to take off. I'll be giddy like a thirteen year old again! Clown camp was a major forming piece of my youth and I really appreciate all of the love and time you and everyone else poured in to it. I was wondering if you have or could get any information on how to reach Ian Shive or Wendy Scutt? I really miss those two and wonder how they are doing, any help would be great.   Katy – Thank you so much for the letter, I'll admit I've been really bad this trip with sending postcards (I have only sent 2). I bought a bunch but have written only two. I have found myself not wanting to write after typing these e-mails so I must apologize. I have also begun to run out of money so I think I am going to have to not send all of the postcards I have, major bummer. I am looking forward to school very much. I'm going to be just up the hill and it will be a fun time. Just you wait; I have plans, good plans…   Mike O – I think pieces of their culture will endure but in a metamorphic state. Which is true for most of the world and Asia specifically. I think Asia will always feel like Asia, but it may become more of an underlining theme then the standard. Every generation will loose pieces of those before it. What this will turn in to, I don't know but time will tell.   Ruth – It is funny to hear you and Joanna set aside time to talk about my letters. There is no reason to feel jealous either, anyone can do what we are doing here, you just have to make it happen. Decide what you want to do and do it. And when you do I hope I get e-mails telling me how it is so I can enjoy it too.  Joanna – Last but not least…Yep there are definitely elephants in Nepal, I saw one with a rider walking down the street in Kathmandu, amid the traffic! With French you could also go to West Africa (Senegal, where I went last) where the national language is French (those French colonists). But I am a little biased; I think the third world has far better places to visit. The cultures and lifestyles are much different then ours offering a change form everyday life at home, and it is a whole lot cheaper to boot. Ok so diseases tend to be a little bit of a problem, but you can't get everything, now can you? I also believe that traveling, especially to places that are very different then at home grows you, I can't really explain it but they do. You will just have to find out on your own what I mean. I'm getting quite a bit darker too. You should see my feet they are hilarious: brown toes, white sandal strap, brown strip, then white where my pants cover my foot. Where did "Monocheli" come from… well it is two words mono and cheli. Mono is monkey in Spanish and cheli is boy in Bengali. So it means "monkey boy" a nickname I got a long time ago from some friends. I really don't like to have numbers in my name and have found out that if you use a different language you can usually be the first one to ever make up that name. I made the name shortly after I came back from Central America where I had picked up some of Spanish and a dear friend of mine who grew up in Bangladesh would always call me "cheli" so it stuck. It is important to remember that those things that are missing here in Nepal and be gotten if you look and very often in tourist areas it is expected that you want them. Most Nepali people expect that westerners want to live like they do at home and will go out of their way to make you comfortable. Yesterday, (Sunday) I had my best view of the mountains ever, with clouds around the bottoms of each. It was amazing. We were going up to see a new temple (Sandeep is leaving tomorrow and he wanted to go) and he pointed out to the right and BAM there they were, I could see all of them with clouds around the bottoms. My breath was taken away. We sat on the stonewall around the temple for about a half an hour talking. They are so inspiring all covered in snow with the veins of rock running trough their white peaks. In New England no mountain will take much over a day to climb once you get to the base, but here you are talking about a week or more to climb any of these mountains and the need for a lot of technical training and skills. Mountains make me all giddy and amazed all at once.

      18/7/03 Namaste, On Thursday Pete and I took a day off so we could go to the immigration office to get our visas extended (they expire next week) as it turns out the government office is only open from 10:30am to 1pm. After waiting a half an hour, we thought they opened at 10am. A rather uninterested official put down his paper and with disinterest looked at our passports and told us to fill out some papers. After talking with two other officials we got our passports back with a new added visa, how pretty. While we were waiting Sandeep talked us into going to watch one of the latest Hindi movies from Bollywood. Now for those of you who have never had the pillage to watch a Bollywood movie I'll tell you a little bit that differ between Bollywood movies and Hollywood movies. They are usually 3 hours long with an intermission in the middle. They are not cheaply made either, yes they are not up to snuff with the best of Hollywood, but they do a pretty good job with the action and (given that I can't understand a word they are saying) seem to have good acting. Much of the cinematography is very well done with an over all good picture quality. But here I must tell you about the major difference… how they regularly (even in action movies) the plot stops and everyone sings (musical what?) in these singing parts clothing and place change about every 10 seconds, one moment they are dancing in a bar wearing jeans and a t-shirt, and the next in the countryside wearing a dress having a picnic. I found this to be the best quality of the movie we were watching, I miss musical movies, of which we have too few in the states.   So I would like to tell you about our movie… "Qayamat: City Under Threat" there are ten major characters (three of which were Miss India at one point, as Sandeep was keen to point out) I have assigned name of Hollywood actors who have played a similar role in an American move to make this plot a little easier to follow. I'm sorry to give away a bit of the plot for all of you who were going to rush out and watch this movie, so if you don't want a plot spoiler please stop reading now and skip to the bottom (I have actually bought the VCD of the movie so we can watch it in the states, but I'm still going to tell the story anyway, but it is not of very good quality and has no subtitles.) I have also omitted some short scenes that were of little importance or entertainment value. Ok here goes nothing, and I hope you enjoy my trip to the movies…  First we are introduced to a Bombay cop (Bruce Willace) who is looking for some criminals but can't find them, and only finds their phone (flash to criminals) There are three criminals (I don't have any good names for them) two are rough and tough men who are a little crazy and the other is one of the miss India 1. They go to a boat and kill some important criminal on his birthday, singing (in English) "happy dead day to you." I think this scene was to show you they are crazy, I could find any real reason. The bad guys go to a club (a dance scene ensues with the guys dancing with the singer and singing) after dancing they enter in to a deal with a bad scientist (Jeff Goldblum) to buy missiles from Pakistan (Indians tend to not like Pakistan, kind of like the US and USSR back in the day.) After a dialogue by the Pakistani general where he eats the Kashmir piece of an India shaped cake, we go to a science laboratory with the good scientist (Nicolas Cage). Who has created a dangerous virus that is stored in small green gel balls and kills all who come in contact with it an a matter of minutes. His co-worker is Jeff (who also deals in illegal missile sales on the side, hmmm…). Nick goes to meet his girl friend (miss India 2), who is frustrated with how he is not very adventurous and is a rather boring scientist. She proceeds to go home after leaving him and another song about her dreaming goes on. Meanwhile Nick back at the lab finds that the virus balls have been stolen. On an Island prison of the cost of Bombay Jeff is giving a tour of the prison to a group of tourist, one of which is Miss India 2 who in her anger at Nick has decided to tour the Island prison. Jeff tells all of the tourist to go in to the cells so they can feel what it was like to be locked up, while all of them are in the cells the bad guys come and tell them all they are hostages (dun dun dun and flash to one of the towers on the island) the Bad guys are laughing next to a missile set up to launch and call the Chief Minister of India, treating to use the virus on all the people of Bombay if they don't give them money and stuff. The plot thickens. The Chief guy tells Bruce to stop them. Bruce tells the Chief about the only prisoner ever to escape from the Island (Sean Conery). Does this sound at all familiar?  While they are bring the longhaired Sean from his prison cell in solitary confinement he has a flash back (a 45min. long flash back!) of his youth and his love (Miss India 3), more songs and costume changes even horse back riding. Also of his live as a thief. It turns out he used to work for the Bad Guys and did a job where he had to steal a very important floppy disk that was kept in a safe surrounded by laser beams. He descended down from the ceiling on a cable and proceeded to do flips and cartwheels through the laser beams, before cracking the save and making a quick get-a-way. (more singing and dancing with his girlfriend, this time the go fishing, the jungle, and the beach, very romantic) He decided to give up his life of crime and go clean. His cohorts in crime, the Bad guys don't take it so well and coax him into one more job. In this job they plot to go traitor on him and get him put in jail and kill his girl to teach him a lesson. Sean goes to a very nice ball and suavely asks a woman to dance while he steals her necklace.  They catch him but he breaks free and runs, while he is running the Bad Guys drive by and hit Miss India 3. To avoid the police Sean ducks into a crowd and finds his girlfriend bleeding in the middle and is caught and put in prison on the Island. He breaks out and goes after the Bad guys and comes across one of their friends in a pool hall. As the friend draws a gun Sean kicks a pool ball out of one of the corners of the pool table and then kicks it again in to his head (is this James Bond or Jet Li?).   Back to modern days, after Bruce convinces Sean to show him, some police and a scientist (Nick) into the prison how he escaped so they can stop his old friends, Sean nods ok. Sean thinks Miss India is dead, but she is not. (Memory flashback, singing, had to be there) Bruce arranges the team and they prepare to assault the prison by water, through the old sewer system. Bruce also visits Miss India 3 to tell her what is happening, she cries. One of the Chief Ministers advisors is in cahoots with the Bad Guys and calls them to warn them, they plan a trap. On the way up Bruce and the police leave Nick and Sean down in the pipes as they go up to get the Bad Guys. Bruce and his team walk right in to the trap a room with an open second floor where all the bad guys gun down all the police and Bruce from above. Nick and Sean hearing the massacre decide they need to do it themselves but Sean is very depressed, his love is dead and he has no reason to continue. Back at the military office where they are watching the mission she walks in and they put her on the radio to encourage him to fight. He gets up and goes like no other). They go to one of the missiles and remove the delicate chains of green virus spheres and dispose of them. They are caught in the action and escape through a tunnel where they ride in an old mining cart down a rail track chased by the some goons who are shooting at them. They break through a blocked off wall and the ceiling collapses and down falls Nick's Miss India (2) and she is amazed he is being so daring and follows them. Sean (who has become more like a Sylvester Stalone) goes on with a Rambo like intensity to kill and beat up all of the Bad Guys' goons.   Back at the Chief Ministers they get the dirty assistant. The Bad Guys decide to send one of their missiles at Bombay, but shoot it in to the water as a threat. In the last goon fight Sean and Nick fight the huge muscle guy strait out of just about every Kung Fu movie ever made. Nick and Sean take out a couple more missiles along the way to fight with the Bad Guys. In a amazing climatic battle, which you will just have to watch if you want to see it, one of the Bad Guys is shot off on a missile and to avoid the bombers, which were deployed as a last resort, Nick lights some smoke flares to signal them to not burn the island. He saves the day the hostages and Sean is reunited with Miss India 3 (singing) and everyone lives happily every after. Yay.   This was quite a enjoyable experience for me that I could share with you in a better way. The best way I can help you is if you go and watch Mission Impossible, Rambo, The Red Dragon, James Bond (one of the old ones), The Rock, and a Miss India Pageant. Then you might get the feel of it, oh and a couple musicals too (in Hindi). Oh and you can't forget how the audience would whistle and holler throughout all the good parts too. I have been promised that not all Bollywood films are such blatant rip-offs.   After the movie I told Sandeep I had to try to get some Bollywood movies with English subtitles to take home. We found a couple (including Qayamat) and I bought some in VCD and DVD. Are all of you college buddies ready for a Bollywood Marathon? I am!   Today (Friday) we worked all day to finish preparing our lesson plans to add to the database here for future trainings (I really don't like this kind of work) and not much happened today. But there was one thing to note. I forgot in the last e-mail to mention that very few of the toilets are the sit down type we are used to; most are squat toilets (i.e. nice porcelain holes in the floor with places to put you feet on either side). Near every toilet there is a water spigot to fill the bucket used to clean after you're done. So today I was in the bathroom in the hostel and I lost my balance. I grabbed the spigot to steady myself and it broke off in my hand! Water was spraying everywhere! This is the second time Nepalize plumbing has broken on me. Quite wet as I come out of the bathroom, with the water still pouring everywhere I go up to the gravity feed water tank on the roof and shut the water off. I must have been beet red as I went to tell my students (how stay in the hostel) what I had done. They all laughed and said I was very strong, while I dripped. If that isn't entertainment I don't know what is? (Bollywood?)  Well one month left as of tomorrow and then we leave, man time has flown.  Steve  Personal Notes: coming soon…

      11/7/03 Namaste, Lately I've been thinking about some of the things that we take for granted in our daily lives, that don't happen here.  Here are some things we (westerners) take for granted, that is very different here:  Driving in your own lane, fast road, or roads at all (much of the country is foot or airplane access only)  Water you can drink from the tap  Stable government  Toilet paper, it is not traditional here, they tend to use a small bucket of water and the left hand. Food, that is I big one.  Silverware, right hand all the way. Cows or buffalos in the middle of the streets unattended  Legal liability, it is your own problem here.  Tall people, there is a "foreigner" size bed, etc. Young children wearing cloths, you spend less on diapers if you don't wear anything Full-length brooms and mops, here you have to get down on the floor to clean it. Bugs, you need a bug net to sleep here or you get eaten alive.  Proper number of passengers on/in vehicles, remember 4 people on a motorcycle. Sitting, often they sit with their legs crossed Indian style in chairs and at the dinner table. Clearing your throat and picking your nose, it is totally normal to do while walking down the street, often do you hear "HHhhhhhhhhgggggggk, Phatu".  Beef, you would get very ridiculed for eating the holy animal.  Good public education  Equal opportunity for all, it isn't as big as it used to be, but still you caste and gender affect your opportunities.  Marriage, love marriage is a relatively new thing and many people don't like it, most are arranged.  Feet, kicking someone even lightly is very insulting, if you kick someone by accident it is normal to touch your hand to your forehead and then to their foot or leg with a hearty apology to show you are below them and didn't mean it. Stepping over someone is also very bad, as is pointing the bottoms of you feet at someone. Animals, Sandeep was amazed that in America there are no native elephants or lions. Solid family structure, most sons live with their parents forever, while daughters go with their husband's family.  Modesty in clothes, this is slowly fading as western clothes and fashion come in it is very conservative here. Women in traditional clothes need to wear a scarf over their shoulders. Electricity, it goes off here almost every other day. That is all I can think of off the top of my head, if you can think of any more do tell. I'm working on a master list.  12/7/03 This last week was the week of shopping… it is strange how with a list of maybe 15 things it takes 3 days (well half days) to go through the bazaar and barter for all of them. But not the shopping is mostly done, all I have left is some bamboo and food goods, which will wait till we are about to leave or even in Kathmandu. On Thursday Pete and I picked up our daura suruwal (traditional Nepali clothed) that we had had made. Now we can walk the roads in style. They are very neat (although the topi (hat) is something else…) but not the most comfortable things in the world. Everyone laughs and smiles when we wear them. We have also, in the desire to have some slightly more comfortable clothes ordered kurtaa pajama (yes real pajamas!), which is a more Indian style dress. They are baggie and loose, unlike the daura suruwals.  I have come to the conclusion that getting into a culture, its habit, clothes, language, etc. helps you to get a greater appreciation for the locals and life in general. I will never be Nepalize (I am glad to be what I am) but it is really rewarding when someone tells you "you eat like Nepali." The customs become a piece of you. It is hard to describe but it grows you, opens your mind to the world. If you have never done it I strongly recommend it. Go somewhere, get out of your comfort zone and try to live life in someone else's shoes (or flip flops). When you start to do things with out thinking it is rather funny, it becomes natural. I have picked up the Nepali nod, instead of a forward bounce, more of a tilt to the side (Sandeep does this all the time). I'm sure I would have to stay somewhere for years before everything became completely natural, if it would ever, someday I'll try.   13/7/03 Saturday was a good day. Sandeep took us for a trip across the lake and up to the World Peace Stupa. The boat ride was nice and relaxing as our boatman tests our Nepali as he paddled. The hike (or trek as all walking for fun is called here) was a nice 300+m hike up to the Stupa. This was our first encounter with Nepali leeches. Wow are they tenacious little buggers, unlike in the states, they move like inch worms and sit on the trail with one end waving around in the air. When your book lands next to them they latch on to your boot and proceed to climb up it like a slinky in reverse until they reach skin. The Stupa was very beautiful in fact rather painful, the white one white with the sun was blinding. We were not privileged enough to have a good view of the mountains, but we did get a very good view of Pokhara and the surrounding valley. We can down the other side to see another cave (I forgot the name now) where supposedly lord shiva had gone at one time or another, as of yet the Hindu mythology still boggles my mind, it has to be the most complicated religion around. We stop by Davi's falls, where surprisingly enough, Davi fell off the falls and died. On our way to Begnas Tal (another lake in the valley) we stopped at our favorite Lassi shop and for some chow main noodles for lunch. The lake was very beautiful I would have liked to swim, but my ear is still a little fussy and not ready for water yet. While we sat by the lake talking and comparing western and eastern life, the mountains peaked out of the clouds for just a couple minutes. It was quite inspiring. It is impressive to think hidden behind the monsoon haze there is one of the highest mountain ridges in the world. They look almost surreal in the background.   Today I got back the second role of film that I have developed in Nepal. The quality left something to be desired, but that is what PhotoShop is for, right? So I've attached a few photos for your enjoyment. They are from our training and our walk down to Pame from last week. There are also photos of us in our daura suruwals for entertainment and a couple others I just liked.  Thanks a bunch for all the thoughts and prayers,  Steve  Some personal notes…  Grand Aunt Frances – You defiantly are grand it it's best meaning. I would love to sometime sit down with you and hear about your stories and ideas. I have spent some time reading your writing about your time in India that my mom gave me and have enjoyed what I have read so far. I have some similar feelings and would like to talk with someone who has left the west for a sizable piece of their life. I think this side is calling me to come live for a while. As it turns out the family I am staying with is from Darjeeling and have seen some family videos and have heard lots about it. It has moved up to one of the next places I would like to go to.    Frank – You are the big man, towering above all  I miss you and that polish humor.  Nina – No prob. I love sharing. I think it was in grade school where I was told, "caring is sharing." I miss the cheese form years ago, if I think hard enough I can taste it still. I loved that.  Dr. Hale – The Devanagri script is helping my Nepali quite a bit. It is also really fun how the jibberish scribbled everywhere is starting to make sense. When I see something and I recognize it I smile.

      6/7/03 Higher learning? Well we are defiantly higher up. Namaste It has been over a week and I have not written. Dhaari naramro bhaai (Very bad younger brother). So I guess I must apologies I have not really been inspired to write, the dreaded writers block has set in. But we'll see what I can manage.  Well Pete and I have been very busy; before I get in to that where did I leave you last? Ahh Saturday, Saturday is our day off. Again we were a little stir crazy and had to get out. The weather was not very much in our favor (something about the monsoon) but in the afternoon we went anyway, equipped with umbrellas. We walked north along the lake for two hours until we reached the first village Khapanti. We got to see more of the beautiful rice fields and the people working on them. Because of the rain all of the workers use a bamboo kind of umbrella that looks like somewhat like a pair of butterfly wings and has a piece of plastic in it to protect from the rain. It is folded over the back and held on by a strap over the forehead. It was interesting to get off of the beaten path a bit I got the impression very few tourist go that far, most stay to the normal trekking routes. It had started to rain as we were drinking the sodas we got at a small restaurant. I used to think I could complain about the weather of central New York. I guess it wasn't a very good call to go to the wettest city in Nepal during the monsoon. But it does have its advantages too. After the rain slowed down we headed out. We had to get home for dinner later. The rain had slowed down to that wonderful point where it is raining but the sun is shining enough that you never get really wet, but are never really dry. This provides a great cooling effect and we enjoyed it. Pete's umbrella had been a little defunked before we left and decided to break as we were walking by not staying open. This provided some entertainment as we laughed about it. We got back with enough time for a warm shower and fresh clothes before dinner; dinner is always the best meal of the day here.  Sunday after class Pete and I went to work preparing our lessons for the Leadership Workshop on Ecotourism we did from Wednesday to Friday for the advanced/experienced guides. After dinner I made a decision to start to learn to write in Nepali, which uses the Devanagari script. In Nepali all of the letters hang from a line and have a very different shape from the Roman alphabet. The language has some distinctive benefits over English the first of being spelling it is entirely phonetic and every letter has only one sound. On the flipside of that, the vowels change depending where in the word they are and there are half letters, which is a little hard to grasp. So to date I have memorized how to write all eleven vowels in both their forms and the first five letters. Only thirty-four letters left.   7/7/03 On last Monday Sandeep and I went to town to just "get out" I've been getting rather stir crazy as of late. I think I have been getting a little frustrated at the girls, who aren't really studding and it shows (I promise all of my professors now that I know how frustrating it is I'll study all the time. Sense they are the reason why I can just go trekking it is a little frustrating. So anyway Sandeep and I go to town near Mahendra Pul (Mahendra's Bridge). My excuse was that I wanted to buy an English-Nepali dictionary for my students and to buy some Nepali and Hindi music, but it was more to just go explore. It was a good trip we found a nice dictionary and got some CDs. Which because of a lack of copyright laws were professionally produced MP3 CDs. I think even if I wanted to buy a real CD I couldn't. Each CD with around 130-160 songs was 100rs (yesterday I got the same CDs for 60rs, a total steal). I bought a variety of music from traditional Nepali folk to Hindi dance pop to the soundtracks from Bollywood. After shopping we went to Mahendra Cave and (are you ready for this) The Bat Cave for a little spelunking. They were both rather fun as we had to wriggle through some small spaces and get rather dirty. Sandeep said he knew exactly where we had to go next. When we returned to Mahendra Pul he took me a lassi shop (lassis are yogurt shakes, rich and sweet) where for 18rs we got banana lassis (they are usually over US$2.50 at an Indian restaurant in Syracuse). I was sooo excited I've been getting lassis at home for years and it was a real treat to get them where they came from. We got the bus home and after dinner called it a night.   Tuesday was pretty normal as Pete and I prepared for our workshop. It is funny how the students have been promoted to experts. There tends to be two major misconceptions the Nepali people make about foreigners: first that we are all rich, yes we have money, but it is not like it falls from the sky. Pete and I figured out that we are paying US$23 a day in airfare alone to be here, which for both of us was only possible through loans, so in theory we right now have less money then most Nepali because we have negative money. I will admit that we do have better facilities to make money, but when we are in the states we have to spend more money too. The second is that we all are smart. It may be that most visitors have a better education, but education does not make someone smart. Thank God I have Pete here with me, so he can make us looks smart. That boy is a smart cookie, I just act it.   Wednesday we began our three-day workshop with leadership in the morning and First Aid in the after noon. The next two days continued with a very similar structure, classes start at 10 and go to 5 with an hour lunch break. We got a look into the style and politics of being a guide in Nepal. There were 21 guides in attendance all of which were experienced guides with very good English skills. Some of their ideas on first aid shocked me ("NO, if someone is suffering from altitude sickness you do NOT push them to go higher! It will not just get better), but all in all it was pretty good. Over the three days we talked a lot about a lot of things, most of which have a direct relation to the underlying reason for our trip here, a local’s perspective on tourism and its impacts. So if you want to hear more about that you might have to come to our capstone presentation (senior thesis) next spring where we will discus our findings. (I have to promote it early, you know you want to be there) or I'm sure we'll make copies of it, or at least the paper. These students (unlike our English students) were very serious about learning and applied themselves very diligently. There is something about teaching that is supremely rewarding. That effect is multiplied even more when your students are really interested and it is a subject you are interested in. I'm going to take this opportunity to include something from Pete, this is taken form another e-mail he sent to one of our professors.   "Starting Wednesday, we began a three-day training workshop on Leadership, Ecotourism, First Aid, and Tying Knots.  There were twenty-one people who attended, consisting of trekking guides and trekking guide trainees, both men and women most of them much older than we.  This offered in incredible opportunity to share and teach information about Ecotourism, Leadership, and First Aid from a Western perspective.  The idea of Ecotourism is a very new idea to them and they were very excited to learn about it.  Not everyone was fluent in English, however, so this did make it a challenge sometimes to explain things.   	Each day there were two classes, three hours long each, and included group activities and practical hands on learning, especially with the First Aid, which their knowledge was surprisingly limited in.   One of the people there was the president of the Trekking Guides Union for the Annapurna Region.  The information that we were talking about, including conservation and responsible environmental practices, he was very eager to learn.   	At the end of the three days, we collected opinions and ideas of what they saw tourism influencing their lives and others around them, what they liked and disliked about it, what they would like to see improved, and what there thoughts were about ecotourism.  This helped us to gain a better understanding into what tourism is doing to Nepal, and ways ecotourism can be used to combat the affects of unregulated tourism.  Almost everyone agreed that the three-day training workshop was too short, and most of the subjects could be stretched out easily into weeklong classes. Seeing how new and enthusiastic these people are about this subject, there is a very high potential for creating a relationship between them and the U.S. to improve their lives in ways related to the field of ecotourism practices. There are plans for a map and compass workshop to be developed and taught by Steve and I in the future weeks.  So far The 3 Sisters Trekking Company has offered a tremendous about of learning, confidence building, leadership, and initiative."  So there is the first major contribution from Pete, my silent supporter. He is the strong silent type, a man of few words and many thoughts. I think this leads to why we make a pretty good team; I'm more the man with many words and few thoughts. It is a prefect fit. So all in all, he thinks and I talk.   On Saturday, our day off, we rested ahhh. Take a deep breath and then do it again, relax. We wanted to go to a Nepali church, but our contact didn't give us complete directions. Oh well, next week.  Sunday after class we went shopping. Nothing like getting your Christmas shopping done early. So I have to a little quite about what I got… but we finished up with two rounds of Lassis (mango and chocolate) emmm. And Pete bought a quality North Face rip off backpack for 575rs. Ok maybe it isn't quality, but it is cheep.  Finally today was a usual teach and work day with no major things going on. But I have gotten my favorite problem, the recurring middle ear infection that I have gotten every year since I punctured my eardrum back in 1997. But I think this is the cheapest one so far with the eardrop and a course of antibiotics costing around US$1.50. gotta love it. Well it is starting to rain and we have to go to dinner.   If you would like any of the old newsletters just ask and I'll send along all of the old ones to you.  Be good.  Steve  Personal notes (there aren't many, very few people are writing me now for some reason):  Uncle Lee – I got your e-mail glad to hear from you, an look forward to more info.  Bidhata – sorry I'm kinda rushed so: ma Nepalimaa boldaichina. Tik chha? The days have been good. I'm interested in seeing if we can stay at your house for a night or two on our way out of Nepal in the middle of August. We are missing you and everyone and would like to see you again before we go.   Dan – I found a place that will make me embroidered BBMC patches for 50rs each, how many do you want? Also write me, tell me how the bike is doing, I need to talk with you, ASAP.

      Namaste, Only a week and a half left here in Nepal. Wow, time flies. I'm going to appoligise for how short i'm sure this letter will be. I also must say i am without spell check this time so be ready for my poor spelling.  We have finished english class, the last one was on friday. We went to church for the last time today as well, and now we are working to finish up our last brochure. I'm worried i will not be able to finish it and they don't have the skills to finish it on their own. So i'm keeping myself very busy and have had little time or insperation to type nice long e-mails. Something about sitting at a computer for fun after working at one all day that is not very inticing. Right now we are planning to leave Pokhara on friday (15th) morning to head for Kathmandu. I guess the road from Pokhara to Kathmandu has been blocked by landslides. I have also been told that the busses are still running, but you have to get out mid-way and walk for anywhere from 15min to an hour (i've been told both) where another bus will meet us and take us to Kathmandu.  We will not be going trekking, there is just too much to do before we leave. I have how ever talked the sisters in to hiking up to a near by peak with a nice view for a photo shoot to get some good photos for ad's and other uses. This will be one of our highlights i think. Right now we are trying to figure out if we will be able to afford to stay with the family we stayed with before in Kathmandu, but we may have to stay in a very cheap hotel instead if that doesn't work out.  It is all comming soo quickly, in two thursdays (21st) we will be back on the other side of the world... scary. Pete will be going home for a week before going to school, and i will be going straight to school to start RA training. So much for time to relax right. I plan to be at Paul Smiths by Friday morning, ready to be trained. weither my eyes and mind will be working is another question, but hay I'll figure that one out when I get there. I want to that all of you for your suport and prayers while we have been over here. they have been a blessing. As you can guess there will not be too meny more of these e-mails, i figure one more in Kathmandu and then one or two to wrap it all up from the states. Thanks all, and stay intouch, it has been a trip (bad pun, i know, i couldn't help it).   Steve   P.S. We have run in to a small problem, and i am open to any help if it is in your range to do so. Our ride from JFK in New York City has incountered a couple problems of his own and to sum it up we are lacking in a ride from NYC to Gloversville (near the Albany area) we are trying to figure out another way home. If you are planning to be around the area on the 21st of August, we get back around 12-1pm and need a ride back to Gloversville (Pete's house) at the least and i would really like a ride to Syracuse if posible, but i'm sure i can get one from my dad, or Pete if i need it. So, if you can help, e-mail me ASAP (here and at trek@3sistersadventure.com) that would be great. I'm sure we'll get home some how, but any help, would be helpful.

      2-8-03  Namaste  The time when I will be back among you is approaching very quickly. Yet some how I feel like there is so much left to do. Oh well, do what you can and figure the rest out later right? Or something like that. We have been getting ready to head home. It is funny how we have as much time left here as we spent in Africa and yet it feels like no time at all. The plan is to stop working next Friday the 9th, which will leave our last week in Pokhara do what ever we would like. We are contemplating going on a short trek, but monetary issues may exclude us from this option. We will figure out something fun to do anyway.   We have been diligently working on the design of two brochures for the 3 Sisters and EWN. This is yet another example of how Pete and I very complimentary. First we brainstorm together, then Pete sketches and draws out beautiful pen drawings which make the background of the brochure. After he is done, I scan them, import them in to Adobe Photoshop (those college classes paid off after all!) and clean them up, add color, photos, and the text. And about a week later, ta da a pretty full color brochure. I must say it has been a continued pleasure to work with Pete this summer, we are very different people with very similar thoughts and goals. So in layman’s terms: we think a lot a like but carry it out in different ways, or at least with different skills. All in all a nice compliment I think. The brochures were just another reminder of this fact to me.  The last couple days I have also had treat to cook with Subash (the guesthouse’s cook) to learn first had how to make tasty Nepali food. I must say he is very good. The quality of his cooking reminded me of how good in Kathmandu, Thulo Didi’s cooking was and how much I miss it. The food here is ok, and sometimes really good, but there is was good and almost never only ok. It is interesting learning how to cook Nepali food from someone who doesn’t really speak English "and the spice, and the potato, and the cutting…" but we have a lot of fun. I also ask him to come eat with us, which I think is a big compliment to him as often in Nepali culture cooks eat by themselves in the kitchen or after everyone has finished kind of like a servant. Sometimes I get rather frustrated at the lack respect that is given to someone who works in a "lower" job here. So I will do my part to buck the system.  Well I’m sorry this letter is a lot shorter then usual but I’m feeling unsure of what to write. So use your imagination and make a good adventure for us to fill the rest of the space for me.  We’ll be home soon.  Steve

      I'm glad to be here with my cousins, I do love this family a lot, it is kinda like the family I never really had at home when I was growing up. It has been awhile since I've come down here and it has been too long.  So as is common when meeting new people there is the question that I have no answer for. "So, what are you going to do after you graduate?" Hmmmm well hmmmm I don't really know. Then there is the other good question "How about your friend? What was her name? Are you still dating?" oh my, hmmm. Then I start picking up on what seem to be hints from my mom that she wants.... grandchildren.... Ahhhhhhh. Ok, stop, think, um, ok, I'm 23, yes I'm not a kid anymore, but it feels like now I need to be an adult. I need to find a job, get a house, get married (you know who needs the whole girlfriend thing) and have kids. woah, woah hold on! Have I crossed that line, am I in that category? Is my future here? Wow, that whole thing came out of nowhere. I was so not ready to even consider something like children. I like to think that I am a responsible person, I like to think that I am mature, but my no means am I even near having kids. Ok I could see getting married, but that takes a couple years assuming there is even a girl. I am not the kind of guy who wants to rush something like that, no sir. So if you can figure we are looking at sometime around 25 to 26 assuming that a girl drops right in to my lap tomorrow, ha, anyway... Yeah, a job, yeah, ok, nevermind, maybe later.

      I've been traveling today and now i am sitting in my cousin's kinda room and kinda office in North Carolina. Traveling is beginning to have a new feel to me, i is creating in me a melancholy feeling of sadness. I think it maybe this trip in particular because i am not really traveling, yet have to do through most of the same steps. My heart is expecting to land somewhere hot and dirty with hustlers and urchins, but instead it is just somewhere else in the US. Not to say that i am not absolutely glad to be here with family, but it is different, it isn't new. But, eh, i'm happy all the same.   Well i was thinking as i was flying today, it is amazing how much one thinks when there is absolutely nothing to do. The first major thought is that i want to try to do more then a list of my daily activities here; i want it to have more meaning, more emotion. So first i may not write everyday, and second i am going to try and write about thoughts and emotions, not about what i have been doing, unless i need to explain how i am feeling.   I was also thinking about what motivates me to write more. You see something very weird for me has happened this year. It started this summer, while i was in Nepal. In Nepal i wrote, and more then just writing, i enjoyed writing. Now if you know me and my history well at all i have never enjoyed writing, ever. I have always struggled and despised writing in the extreme. I was labeled with an "extreme disability in written English" in middle school, as well as spelling and grammar disabilities. I have always had a fear of writing, it is rather illogical and hard for even me to understand but to say it bluntly i have always struggled and despised writing as something i would do for classes and would do to the minimum possible. I have failed my fair share of English classes in my day. So while i was in Nepal i wrote a newsletter to send back to friends and family here telling about my travels and the things i did and learned. I really enjoyed myself and i think there were two major reasons; I was not pressured to write, i was not given explications or goals i had to meet, i just did it to do it. And the other major reason was the feed back, i would get a handful of encouragement from all those who were reading my newsletter on a regular basis. This made me want to write more, and more, so i did. I would spend a couple days taking notes and doing a little research to prepare for my next newsletter, i think that is where it began.   When i got to school i had to take English 132 (or 102 for normal colleges) the equivalent of my second semester of freshman English. I had taken this before at OCC, twice, after failing it once, i got a D, which didn't transfer to Paul Smith's sooooo here i am taking it for the third time. Argh, i thought, but it turned out to be just what i needed. My teacher was a stickler he wanted the work on time and was very hard nosed about it. So i didn't do it all right the way he wanted it. He told me i had failed, yet i liked him and after being told i had failed i wrote what i was supposed to write and asked him to critique it so when i took the class again next semester i would be ready. He loved my writing, I was shocked, and he let me back in the class. He probably doesn't even realize it but he has helped me to do something i have never been able to do, write and enjoy it. So i guess this is more of a tribute to him and to how i have started to over come some of my emotional barriers regarding writing. Now on the flip side i have lots of skills that need to be improved, which is where i think this will help to motivate me to improve and practice. So with all that said and done, i want you (the reader, who may be a friend i know or some shmoe who is reading this to help me out and encourage me, give me feedback on what you like and don't like, how to improve, and just the plain fact that someone is reading this.   Well seeing as there is no really easy way to do that with a Blog (unlike a livejournal) i have come up with a couple options...  You can e-mail me at MonoCheli@yahoo.com and tell me what you think, or you can e-mail meat Monocheli@yahoo.com and i will invite you into this Blog and give you posting rights so you can post your comments here. Your choice, but i would like to hear from you either way.  I also am going to see about over the next couple days figuring out a nice way to put my newsletters from Nepal up on this Blog so it is accessable to all you people who didn't get them over the summer. Well, enjoy, there is more to come.

      I have always hated loosing friends. It is made even worse when it is because of something stupid. Something like alcohol.   Here is the paper i wrote for my English final this semester... it says a lot.  English 132  Seidenstein Final Examination Dec. 14, 2003               Errol    Let me tell you a story about my friend Errol and how he changed my life. I met Errol when I was thirteen. His dad had moved from Minnesota to Syracuse for work, bringing Errol and his family with him. Errol, and his younger brother, Ian quickly became my best friends. We were almost inseparable; I would go over to his house everyday after school and we would play Nintendo games and goof-off to no end. Errol was a genius at Super Nintendo he could do anything. His mom welcomed me into their house like her third son. We were young and innocent life was amazing. The following year his dad was transferred back to Minnesota. They packed up everything and left to go back home. I was crushed. I missed them dearly. We stayed in contact through letters and phone calls, looking forward to when we would be able to see each other again.  Meanwhile life went on I found new friend and started to grow up, some. My new friends had some different habits. They were drinkers. I quickly developed a taste for alcohol, I liked it. We would get our hands on alcohol whenever we had money, one of my friends older brothers would buy for us if we gave some extra cash for him. We would usually get hard liquors, Bacardi, Smirnoff, Jack D, etc. They packed more punch and were more portable then Beer or wine. We would go out into the woods or to a friend's house while their parents were away and get hammered on a weekly basis. I was fourteen going on fifteen and a total bad ass.  For my fifteenth birthday my dad and Errol's mom went half and half to buy me an airplane ticket to Minnesota for three weeks over summer vacation. I couldn't have been more excited. Visions of the old days, kickin' around playing Nintendo flooded my head, Super Mario World, Final Fantasy II, Super Metroid, Super Mario Cart, Doctor Mario, and of course Super Bomberman. I still had not found a friend that I clicked with like Errol and I had.  When the time came for me to leave in early August I was ready. The plane trip took no time, and before long I was riding in a mini-van with Errol and Ian to their house. Because of the differences in Minnesotan law and his age Errol had just gotten his drivers license and could drive but only during the day.  We got back to the house and I was welcomed in like an old relative. Even the cats remembered me.  'Hey Sherri", I always thought that it was rather funny that Errol's mom insisted that everyone called her Sherri, even her own children.  "Tiffany!" Errol's younger sister came running in to give me a hug. She must have been around 10 years old at that point with her beautiful blond hair that was always in snarls. She always liked me because I wouldn't beat on her like her brothers.     Errol's dad, Bill, wasn't around much; he spent most of his time working.  We made some plans, you know simple stuff, like going to The Mall of America and the near by amusement park. But, the rest of the time we got back in to old habits, Nintendo. It didn't take long for me to realize that life for Errol had also changed. After his parents went to bed around 10pm he asked me if I wanted some Kaluah mudslide. "It tastes just like a milk shake. And gets you a little fucked up." He explained. My face lit up, "you drink? When did you start that? And yes!" "Every night, Wanna play some Super Bomberman?" It was like old times, but now we were older, more mature. Playing Nintendo while drunk has some certain kind of appeal. It is hard to describe. Before long a couple of Errol's friends turn up, John, Carl, and Aaron. They join in bringing their own bottle of Schnapps to add to the mix. Aaron who was a little bit older and the one who drove also brought a pipe and some pot. I had never smoked before. I remembered all the times my teachers had told us about how bad pot was. They were the same teachers who told us that drinking was bad and would go home and drink anyway. Screw them and their stupid rules, they were stupid hypocrites, what did they know. It is just a little fun, I had never heard of someone dying from a little pot or booze.  I fit right in to their habits, sleep in 'till the afternoon, Get up, go out, come back in the evening, wait for his parents to go to sleep and then get all messed up and play Nintendo. Sometimes we would all pile into Aaron's car and go down to the local gas station and get some snack foods. It was all fun and games. I don't really remember too much of what we would do, but we all had fun anyway.   It was about two weeks into my time there with one more left before I would have to return. After a bottle of vodka and several hits we were playing Super Bomberman. It is a four-player game so most of us were involved. We played for a couple hours and I was getting tired. Everyone decided they wanted to go get some food. "Steve, wanna go get some grub, we're going to go for a ride down to the 7-11?"  "Naw, I think tonight I'm just gonna crash tonight, you guys go have some fun." I curled up on the floor with a blanket, like I did every night, and fell asleep.  "STEVE, STEVE, STEVE!" Sherri was shaking me awake. "Get up!" "Huh? Yeah?" I stretched and rubbed my eyes. "I just got a call from the police; Errol and Ian got in an accident. They are in the hospital. Bill and I are going. Can you watch Tiff till we get back?" Her face had that look, like she was holding back something. Her eyes were wrapped in plastic.  "Sure" My mind still wasn't quite working. "She is sleeping; I didn't want to wake her. You know where the food is. We'll call you later, be good." She hugged me and went back upstairs. I noticed it was still dark outside. I faintly heard the van pulling away as I closed my eyes again.   I got up around 11am and walked upstairs, "Yawwwwhhan". I have never been the biggest morning person. Tiffany was sitting in her nightgown at the table eating a bowl of Captain Crunch.  "Good morning Steve." She Smiled and asked, "Where did everyone go?" "I'm not sure Tiff." I took a seat at the table next to her. There was a note on the table, the instant I saw it I remembered Sherri waking me up. "Sherri told me that Errol and Ian got in a little trouble last night, and her and dad went to help them out. They'll call me later. Till then it is just you and me." I smile to try and show that there is nothing to worry about.  She places her little hand on mine, "I hope they're all, ok" It is amazing how children understand so much more then what we give them credit for.  Around 3pm the phone rang, "Steve, its Sherri, we are at the hospital. Bill will be home later tonight. The boys got into a car accident last night. Aaron was driving and went of the road and hit a large concrete block at fifty-five miles per hour. No one was wearing seat belts. Ian is ok, but very shook up; they want him to spend the night. He'll be home tomorrow if everything goes well. Errol is in ICU, he is in a coma, and has broken most of the bones in his face. He has severe cerebral hemorrhaging. They had to put a drain tube in his brain to reduce the pressure. They don't know what is going to happen.  I didn't answer her right away, my brain stopped. I didn't know what to think, or what I should do. "Ok"  "I'm going to stay here with Errol for now. Tell Tiff that there was an accident and Errol is hurt. He is going to stay at the hospital for a little while. Ian will be back tomorrow. Will you be ok staying there with Tiff?" Her voice had a frail weakness to it that I had never heard before. "Yes Sherri, Tiff and I will be fine, you take care there" The full impact of what was going on hadn't set in yet. I was doing what had to be done, and not thinking about it. "Ok, the number here is 391-7285, we are in ICU room 9, if you need anything. I'll call if anything changes. Be good."  Ian came home the next day, he was swore everywhere and had very bad whiplash. Of the other three people in the car, Carl came out with the same injuries as Ian. John had to have a five-inch piece of the plastic dashboard removed from his calf. Aaron had to get several stitched in his face from where his head hit the steering wheel. Errol had been sitting behind Aaron and knocked Aaron down as he was propelled in to the windshield, breaking it and every bone in his face. Errol stayed in a coma till the day before I was flying home. I went down to see him. When I got there he was sleeping. The surgeons couldn't do anything about the broken bones in his face till after they stabilized his brain, so his face was distorted and swollen, barely recognizable as my close friend; one eye was almost swollen shut. His skin was a mix of purple, red, and flesh. They had shaved half of his head where they had placed stitched and installed a drain tube in to his forehead. There was still dried blood in his hair, they didn't want to wash it and risk an infection. After a couple minutes his functional eye opened and wondered around the room. "Errol?" I whispered. I held his hand, and no other words would come to my mouth.  After a couple moments he managed to focus his eye on me. He tried to squint to see better and flinched from the pain. "Who?"  "Steve, it is me, Steve." "Hey, Steve, how's it hanggin' he trailed of, back to sleep. The doctor said he was on a lot of morphine and that is why he couldn't stay awake.  I squeezed his hand, "I love you bro." I turned and left, tears dripping of my cheeks. As I walked out I thought about Errol, and that night. How stupid we had been. How someone must have been watching over me. How I had gone with them every other night for the last couple weeks. I could barely breathe. When I got back to the house, I packed, to get ready for the early flight I had the next morning. I realized I would never drink or smoke anything ever again in my life. I was a fool; I was done with that kind of fun.   Errol called me three months later when he got out of the hospital. "Hey, Steve, how's it hangin'?" He had a slight slur.  "I'm doing good, doin' good. How about you? How are you doing?" "Well you know, I'm recovering, I have really bad headaches all the time, and I have trouble remembering things, My hair is growing back. I have a little trouble balancing and walking, but they say that should get better." Holding back the sadness that started to creep back into my mind I reply "That sounds good, so you're doing well."  "Yeah, I've found out that if I smoke a bit it helps to make me feel better. My friend is going to try and get me some pills that will make me feel better too." "Oh, that sounds nice Errol, hey I have to go, I was just on my way out we'll talk later, ok?" I couldn't continue to talk to him. "Yeah man, later, when are you going to come back out so we can party again?"  "I don't know bro, we'll see; take care of yourself, ok." " Always, you know me."

      Welcome to my blog. Its life begins today the last day of the winter semester of my last year of college. This is the story of my life, as it happens. Are you ready? I can see the tension and anticipation.

      I am back at school again. It is my last semester. Then life. Whatever that means.  I have had a busy break, very busy, but then again busyness is the defining factor of our culture, so I guess I am just living as I should. After a wonderful time in North Carolina visiting family I returned to Syracuse to pack and then get on a bus to go to Illinois for a massive convention called Urbana (check  urlLink www.urbana.org  for more info) Urbana was a wonderfully challenging missions convention. The speakers urged and challenged me and encouraged my faith. Urbana also gave me the opportunity to talk with one of my Xs and find some deeply need closure, I thank her dearly for that. Some background; on this… George (I’ve changed her name for her protection) and I dated for almost two years while I was at my first college (that was when I was 20 to 21.) She is an exceptionally sweet girl, and I care for her greatly. She was also the first girl I dated in a Christian context. We decided that we would strive to maintain each other’s purity and guarded ourselves from sexual sin. We decided we would not even kiss. We did this for the entirety of the time we were dating. I think it has to have been the most health relationship I have had to date. Our communication, conflict resolution, and just about everything else was amazing. The relationship was getting serious.   Now I’m sure you thinking “Why? That sounds like it was perfect, why did you break up with her?!” Well I was getting ready to leave for a semester to study in Latin America (Costa Rica mostly) and I got to thinking about how much traveling means to me, how I want to spend a large chunk of my life on foreign soils. I was talking with my dad about my trip and he said “What about George? What happens to here when you find some great Amazonian woman?” I was kind of shocked and this statement, but brushed it off. Later that day I was at my good friend Dan’s house and he said “What about George? She isn’t going to be able to keep up with your wanderlust? Are you going to let her hold you back?” Now this was weird. Never in all the time George and I dated did either of them say anything about this. And then in one day, a couple hours even both said pretty much the same thing. Scary. I trust both of them greatly for their advice and have for years so I had to think about this. I believe that if you are dating it is with the intention of getting married, well seeing if you should get married, not just for pleasure. When I think about the woman who I would like to marry there are several things I look for; one of them is that her and I have compatible life goals. Instantly it flooded through my head how many times I had asked her “When are you going to be ready to come travel, and adventure with me?” then I remembered how many times she would ask “How long is it going to take for you to get the travel thing out of your system and settle down?” Aaaahhhhh my perfect relationship, well isn’t!   I was going to leave in a few days and would not be back for months, not an idea situation to think about breaking up with someone to say the least. I had three days till I would see George and say good-bye. I took this time to pray and meditate on God’s will. I wasn’t positive as to what I should do, but I saw only three possible choices. 1.	Break up now, face to face, the respectfully way to do it. 2.	Wait, think it over more, then if still break up then I could send a letter (I was not going to have access to a phone while I was away) 3.	Wait, think it over more, then if still break up then I would wait till I got back and tell her. Making her wait for three months just to dump her.   Of the three options I felt the first was the best and most respectful way to do it if I was going to. After extensive prayer God was pointing towards the fact this relationship was not meant to be. I was trying to change her in to something she wasn’t, and she was also trying to do the same to me. I still cared for her greatly, I didn’t want to do it. But I buckled down and did it anyway. It hurt, it hurt so bad. I felt so guilty, I hurt her, I didn’t want to but I did. I would rather be dumped any day then have to dump someone. Getting dumped is easy, you get angry, and then get over it. When you dump you feel guilty, you have doubt, you feel responsible.  So I packed and then I left. I left to grieve in another place, with other people.   I didn’t hate her, I didn’t want to never see her again. In fact I wanted to talk to her to know she was doing ok, to try and be her friend. While I was gone I sent her some letters telling her this. I think I was not clear enough on exactly what I wanted and I gave her the impression that I wanted to date again. When I came back home I called he to go and see her. When it became clear that I didn’t want to date again she got angry (she was always a feisty one) to say the least our relationship from then on was very strained and lead to further anger from her (justifiably so). I kept hoping and praying that she would get over it and then we could talk and be friendly. It didn’t happen. Me being there was preventing her from getting over me and healing properly. A year later she told me we couldn’t talk anymore. I understood why, but it felt… I felt empty. I didn’t know what to do, but I figured it would be best to give her, her space. This was last January.   Urbana marked the two-year anniversary of our break up. I found out from a mutual friend that she and I were both going to be going and would in fact have to get on the same bus to Illinois. My stomach was in knots. As it turned out there were enough people from upstate New York that there were three buses. She got on a different bus then I; so we didn’t talk then. Once there I lost everyone in the housing meat grinder (there were 20,000 people there) but as it turned out she was in the building next to mine and I would run into her on the street walking from one thing to the other. I ventured a “Hello” and a strained “Hello” was returned. We began to talk, cautiously. I asked her if we could sit down sometime as friends and just catch up, see how each other was doing, what is new, etc. We agreed on a time and place the next day.  In our talk we talked about many things and did a good job of keeping old emotions in check. It was not my intention, but our conversation wandered to the last days of our relationship. I told her what had happened (see above) and why. She had her suppositions about what had happened and wanted to know exactly. I guess it showed how hard it was for me to do it. She then told me she forgave me, that she understands why I did what I did, and more then that that she agrees with my choice; That I had done the right thing. I took a deep breath, I cried a couple tears holding back more. Tears of happiness.

      I have been offered a job from Tresslercare youth services to be a wilderness instructor (here is the link for those wishing more info... urlLink  )The job would entail going on month long trips with court appointed youth (bad kids, but not supper bad) to help them to realize the errors of their ways and to try to get them to become a functioning part of society. The trick is that for spending a month with kids non-stop, i get a month off... so i get a tone of paid vacations every year for working so hard when i am working. The major problem with the job is that it is in PA and well i kinda don't want to leave Syracuse yet... so i am tossed up... i am going to think and pray about it for a night.

      I have been looking for jobs... This is no easy task given some of my current choices. Right now I want to try to stay in Syracuse, so right there I have eliminated all of my job opportunities in my field. So now what? I don't know. Right now I am talking to a guy in PA about a job working with court appointed youth for a month at a time. There I would work for a month and then have a month off, more or less. But I don't know. Pray for me.  So I have a fun story. See yesterday I went for a ride on my motorcycle, more over I took a ride to Ithaca to go cliff jumping. I have not jumped in Ithaca for over two years... I missed it while I was at college. But more then going on my motorcycle to Ithaca to jump of cliffs, I goaded a new friend of mine to go with me! (wow was she stupid, hehe) so on the way down there I got lost, gimme a break I haven't done it for 2 years! So we wandered around for a bit... Then asked for directions, yes men can ask for directions! So we found our way to Ithaca. Yay.  We stopped and got some food at Green Star one of the coolest grocery stores! Emmm wheat meat and off to jumping and swimming. Ithaca offers some of the more beautiful places to swim, and the also offer some of the safer place to jump from high places into water! Well i guess Court is not a jumper... but she is a swimmer so it wasn't a waste of time. We swam and jumped , well i jumped, Well she jumped a couple times and given her dancing background it was quite ungraceful, but it was funny to watch. When we were all done jumping we went back to the bike and suited up to ride back. We didn't make it too far before those sever thunderstorm warnings that i had ignored caught up to us. Oops... But on the bright side it gave us and opportunity to stop at A&W and get a root bear float! gotta love drive up restaurant. When the weather broke we got back on and continued the ride. The good weather didn't last long. We got nailed shortly after getting on 81 and got very wet. Later i resorted to lining my jacked with paper towels from the gas station to keep myself kinda dry and warm. Court got of light, i was her rain break so don't listen to her when she says she got drenched. In her excitement as we pulled onto her street she squeezed me, and my jacket loaded with paper towels that were super saturated with water, squeezing all of the cold rain water out and on to me... eeeeggggaaaaa, very unpleasant. But we were back home soon. Little did she know when we left that the trip was going to be  that much fun.

      Well i am done with college, and have my own BS. so now what? i have no clue, but everyone keeps telling me to get a job. So a job hunting i am. but there isn't much in Syracuse and somewhere i got this notion that i need to stay here for a bit and get back into church and friends, etc. So here i am in Syracuse, with no job, and a dwindling bank account... eh well i guess i can go camping for a bit. Sorry for all of you avid fans that i almost never write (all two of you, if that).

      So… I have taken the job from Tressler in PA. I have gone through training and have been helping out in a variety of ways as needed, and have been prepping for my first course, which leaves on Aug 23. I have kinda moved to PA, and kinda not moved. I have a small cabin down here that is part of the job. It is just two rooms with no water, but there is a common building with showers and a kitchen near by. I am excited to leave for my first course, but first I will have a week and change off for a vacation before I head out. While I am doing a course I will be totally in the woods with little free time and contact to the outside world, but I do get a day or two in the middle where I am off, for sanity purposes. But the big benefit of this kind of job is the concept that when I am not of course I get paid vacation. I will be doing 6 courses a year for a modest salary with complete benefits and little to no personal expenses while out on course. So I am not complaining. It is my hope that this will allow me to pay off most if not all of my student loans from college in the next year or so. It will also allow me to take a couple month vacations a couple times over the next year. Maybe I can get out and explore this world of ours a bit more. Asia may be calling me back sooner then I thought… We’ll see what God has planned for me in due time. Right now my life is changing so much so quickly that I am having trouble keeping up.   I have been spending a lot of time living out of doors in the last few months and am getting ready to spend much more time living in God’s great creation. I have found that when I am living outside of the busy world, the “real world” I see that I am a much more focused person, I am more consistent with my communion with God and my personal journaling and reading times. I find that when I simplify life in the wild I am a better person. College has been draining my spirit for the last two years. When I was near the end of my college career I was a very different person then I have ever been. I think I was separate from God in my walk, and because of this I was depressed and not the normal Steve most of the world is used to. I am feeling so much more alive again; I am holding my head high again and smiling to the world again. I have revived my personal relationship with God and he has blessed me in many ways, as always I need continued prayer, but things are much brighter again. God Rocks!  Some other new things… It seams that I will not be able to check my e-mail while in PA, the service provider from Tressler has a block on Yahoo… so no e-mail there. Major bummer. But on the bright side I can be reached and have messages left by either snail mail at “Stephen Waldron, Tresslercare Wilderness Center, 571 Mountain Road, P.O. Box 10, Boiling Springs, PA 17007” I do get mail, and send mail while I am out on course. I can also be reached via my new fo-fangled cell phone, to get the number just call my house and ask my dad for it or send me a letter with your number and I’ll call you back. I will also do my best to get out every now and then to check my e-mail out in the world, but don’t expect it to be anything regular. I have also activated the comments option to this blog, so I will be able to read your thoughts about what I write here, please post comments, I would love to hear from you.  Right now I have a very full fall till Christmas. I will be on course from Aug 23 to Sept 22. Then go out on the Oct. 4 till Nov. 3 and again on Nov. 22 to Dec. 22. So I am planning to have little free time or life for that matter till next year, then I have a couple months of vacation coming to me. So I am a busy boy. I think I am going to stop for now, there is more to say, but I am going to save that for another day…

      Last night was the tea lottery.  It was very very fun.  I ended up getting Oolong #18, Rooibos caramel and jin xian te jian.  THe Rooibos caramel is a very popular rooibos, I've had it before. The other two I've never had before.  Oolong 18 is a very light and delicate colored oolong.  The flavor is bold and floral.  A nice evening tea.  The Jin Xian te Jian is an organic.  It infuses at 180°F for 3 minutes.  At first, I thought that this tea was an oolong, but I was wrong.   It had barely any color at all, most likely a green tea.  The smell was very unique.  It smelled like the water was cooking the tea leaves.  very strange.  The taste was as unique as the smell.  Slightly smokey but very floral at the same time.  A truly mystifying and whimsical tea.

      Last evening, which happened to be The World of Tea, I happened to be feeling very under the weather. I decided to start off with Chamomile tea. This proved to be the best decision I had made that entire day. As soon as the aromatic tea flavored with honey slid down my throat I felt my esophagus completely open up. What wonderful healing powers this tea possesses for today I am feeling almost 100%.  Twiggy

      So, in preparation for The World of Tea, I was finishing up the featured tea list.  Lucas then told me that he was willing to donate some of his teas to the event.  So I gladly took the teas and recorded them in the featured tea list.  Well, I was typing up one description and it sounded like a very delicious Oolong.  So I decided that I must try it.  Jasmine #12 was the tea (From Adagio.com).  as soon as I added the water, the aroma of the tea was very pleasing.  They weren't kidding when they said that it had the scent of the night-blooming jasmine flowers.  Very very nice.   I had to tell someone about this.  So I went to Lucas.  After tasting the tea, he decided to take it off the featured tea list (I strongly agree with his decision).    Well, we almost had an awesome tea for The World of Tea, but I think that it would be better if enjoyed in a nice quite room in alone, or better yet, in a room with some close friends.    -Matt

      I have decided on this, the longest night of my semester, to drink lots and lots of tea. It is now four in the morning, and I am currently sipping my White Bean tea. A wonderfully flowery tea, also, quite beautiful to watch as well. It is a white tea, being such, it is also quite expensive, not to mention unavailable. However, it is well worth its price. Just a note on this night of teas.

      When most civilized people think of drinking tea, the following image is usually what comes to mind:  a lazy afternoon, sun streaming in through the Venetian blinds and meandering about the room like the aroma flowing from the kettle that takes center stage on the "tea table".  A group of people are sitting around, cordially discussing the days events of quite a smart cup of tea.  Yes, this would be most conventional by most tea drinkers' standards.   Well, I apparently am not so conventional.  Last night, I wrote a paper and oh how I wrote that paper:  a paper that I thought was due today (apparently the due date has moved to next week, but that of course is beside the point).  Oh, and by the way, I wrote this paper from midnight to three in the morning.  Well, tea, being the magical brew that it is, contains caffeine:  a substance without which, I may never have survived through the night.  Aside from its ability to keep one alert, tea seems to make study pass much quicker, and in a much more enjoyable manner.  Of the four cups of tea I had while writing, I had earl grey, Assam melody, caramel, and dragonwell requiem.  Three cheers for wonderful, utilitarian tea!

      Ok, so I know that you're not supposed to infuse tea for a longer time than it recommends to do, however, I did this totally on accident.  I was making a cup of Jade bells while I was preparing for the tea time tonight.  Well, I had poured the water into my Aria and then left it alone.  Well, after about 10 minutes, I was all done and I had completely forgot about my tea.  Well, I frantically got up and ran for my Aria.    The tea was a deep yellow, almost a green.  When I tried it, I was expecting it to be extremely bitter.  However, when I tried it, I realized that it was the best that I've ever tasted it.  This time I was lucky, next time I might not be.

      Bitter.  That is what I first thought when I heard of chocolate tea.  I recently ordered some from Adagio.  I first brewed it this afternoon around lunch time.  I was planning on eating a bagel.  When it was infusing, the smell was delicious.  It reminded me of being in Hershey, PA near the chocolate factory.  When I tasted it, it was in fact, bitter.  I didn't infuse it too long either, just the entire 5 minutes.  So I added  a bit of sugar, not a whole packet, but about a half teaspoon.  The sugar brought out the rest of the flavor of the chocolate and made this tea a delightful blend.  My rating for this tea, excellent.    Serving suggestions,  1. serve with half a teaspoon of sugar 2. serve with some sweet cookie or cracker

      A delicate and smooth tea from the Hunan region of China.  A pale green tea, it is full of robust flavor.  The bud is more of tea leaves shaped into a bell with no flower, slightly depressing, but the flavor makes up for it.

      Today, I am drinking a wonderful tea made from stinging nettles, a common weed in most areas.  I purchased it at the food co-op in Pottsdam and I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised.  The smell is like that of fresh cut grass.  It takes me back to the days when running around in the lawn barefoot after dad mowed it was the best thing ever.  The taste is not grassy, so don't worry.  It is a fairly mild tea, but the taste is nothing like any other tea I have tried.  I suppose that you could say that about most herbals as they all have their own distinctive flavors.  I think that one of the best things about this tea is that it is very cheap as teas go.  I think I paid 60 cents for around half an ounce, maybe more.  I would not drink this every day, but it is a great tea to inspire memories of childhood summers.

      Some teas are just better than others.  For example, Lapsang Souchong, for such an acclaimed tea, doesn't hold up to the teas of time.  Just give me a  urlLink    any day.    So far today, I've had the pleasure of drinking two different teas.  The first was the Nepal SFTGFOP1 CL from Upton.  It had a delightful color, nice and deep.  However, it lacked general body.  The flavour was good, but it just tasted like tea flavored water instead of a nice full tea.  It might have needed a sweetener, but I didn't have time to get it ready.  After the tea left my mouth, a sweet tasting nuance.  I enjoyed this taste, but I don't think that the tea was as good as I originally thought it would be.  The second tea for today was the Darjeeling rhapsody 22 from Adagio.  This tea had a pale amber color.  When infusing, the leaves didn't separate or enlarge as much as the other teas.  #22 seems to be a nice medium bodied tea with a delicate flavor and a slight hint of a pleasant smell.    That's all for now, hopefully I'll have more tonight.  -Matt

      A bit drowsy, a bit late.  Slow moving yet building speed.  White Swan running with me, exploding in its flowered display.  The moment comes, the moment anticipated.  Church bells ring, the time has come.  What a way to start the day!

      Well, so far, I've had 5 teas exclusively for myself.  (In chronological order) Zhuan Cha, red bloom, golden needle, Kings tea, and assam melody.  All except the kings tea were from adagio.   The Adagio teas are very exquisite teas.  The flavour development with all the teas were exceptional.  Zhuan Cha and red bloom are both display teas which explode into marvelous shapes when infused.  I would say my most favorite tea of the 5 so far would be the red bloom.  This tea has a smooth flavour and a delicate aroma.  The taste at first is a traditional black, but the smooth flavour at the end leaves your mouth feeling fresh and ready for more.

      Today started with a delightful cup of Berry Black Fruitea Darjeeling black tea from Numi during work in the mid-morning. This tea boasts a invigorating strength wrapped with a sweet fruit coating, perfect for those lazy morning taste buds.   For the Afternoon I opted for a more relaxing cup of Pina Colada tea from Adagio Teas.  This fragrant tea has a subtle flavor with a natural sweetness that can easily carry one through the afternoon with a smile.  The evening brought with it a delightful host of teas to calm and sooth the soul.  A rousing cup made from Hibiscus flowers prepared the mind for a few hours of stimulating conversation as the warm beverages flowed all around. As the company became more contemplative a cup or Lemon Grass from Adagio Teas helped me to wax the philosophical. And lastly a smooth cup of Chamomile from Adagio Teas with a dollop of honey prepared me to drift of in to the land of dreams full of pleasant thoughts.

      Well, It looks as though the end of the year has come, And so, with a heavy heart, we sign off until next semester. Sigh, Hopefully however, we will get updates on new tea and other such items through the summer from our seperated society of tea snobs. I for one will do my best to keep you all informed of the new happenings and experiences of tea.  The End...for now
