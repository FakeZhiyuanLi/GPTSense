         I hadn't realized the movie would make me cry.  I hadn't anticipated how heartbroken and angry I would feel as I walked out into the street - also scared, angry, sad, agog at the evil being done in the name of America.   I'm going to do everything I can to help John Kerry get elected.  I don't believe that John Kerry is a golden-hearted honest man, but I'm sure that he won't take us to war for no reason.  I'm sure he's not a treasonous ideologue.  The neocons have led us onto a path of constant war.  It's going to take a generation to backtrack, and that's if we start today.   urlLink www.johnkerry.com   urlLink www.keeverforcongress.com   urlLink www.moveon.org   There's plenty more.  Do something.  Today is the last day to donate to candidates in this quarter.  Every House Seat in the country will be on the November ballot along with 1/3 of the Senate seats.  What are you going to do?

         The  urlLink NYT reports  on the Democratic National Convention - "But what is close to certain now, they said, is that Mr. Clinton will speak in prime time on the convention's opening night, July 26; Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts will speak in prime time on July 27; Senator John Kerry's running mate, who has yet to be named, will speak on July 28; and Mr. Kerry will give his acceptance speech on July 29."    Yes, I'm asking, like the rest of you, what about Al Gore, Howard Dean, Carol Mosely Braun, and Big Al Sharpton?  Can one convention hold that much personality?  And speaking of personality, the  urlLink NYT reports  "A day after not getting the Green Party's endorsement for president, Ralph Nader brushed off the rejection as an inconvenience, described the party as "strange," called the party's national nominating convention "a cabal" and predicted who the big loser in its decision not to endorse him would be." This may be Dem hatchet job on this goggle-eyed wunderkind, but it's clear that his impact in this race will be a lot less than was initially expected.  Without the Greens, it will be hard for him to get onto most ballots.  Meanwhile, back in Iraq, the fledgling government made up entirely of American appointees tries to figure out how sovereignty could feel so powerless.  Bremer  urlLink leaves his footprint  on the 51st state,  "BAGHDAD, June 26 -- U.S. administrator L. Paul Bremer has issued a raft of edicts revising Iraq's legal code and has appointed at least two dozen Iraqis to government jobs with multi-year terms in an attempt to promote his concepts of governance long after the planned handover of political authority on Wednesday."  Please remember, too, that all CPA contracts must, by  urlLink U.N.law , be upheld by the new sovereign Iraqi pseudogovernment.   urlLink TomDispatch writes  about the pseudostate, asserting, "Iraq reenters the world with its sovereignty weighed down and constrained by 97 L. Paul Bremer-inspired occupation administration "legal orders" that, for years to come, are meant to control practically all Iraqi acts from who can take part in elections to how you drive your car (two handed, no horns except in "emergency situations")."   This sovereignty thing is great, huh?  It's just another example of the ways that the right in this nation controls the rhetoric, and the ways that the mainstream media uses new definitions for words like sovereignty without blinking a journalistic eye.  A longer post on this forthcoming.  BushCo., having received a 'crushing defeat' at the hands of the Supreme Court in it's ruling allowing Gitmo prisoners access to U.S. courts, promptly begins  urlLink trying three of them in military tribunals .  I'm guessing this is not what the plaintiffs were hoping for.  Aside from Democrats, Republicans, Iraqis, and doomed prisoners - there's much celebrating in Nudietown tonight as  urlLink the Supreme Court hands down a decision  calling porn blockers on the internet a breach of First Amendment Rights.  Lastly, heading off all sorts of trouble,  urlLink Canadians have responded  to the Edible Ballot Society by warning election officials not to eat their ballots.

         GWBushCo. plans to have yesterday's illusory handover to the Iraqis mark the end of Bush's poll rating slide.  Rove stood atop Cheney's quivering lip to shout, "I have come at the turn of the tide".  Condi slipped the Preznit a neatly written, suitable for framing in fundraising efforts, note heralding Iraq as a sovereign nation.  This is where the gang declares victory and runs away to talk about how great the stock market is doing.  Jerry Bremer, whose Mach 4 exit from the sovereign state of Iraq was far from a V-I day moment, will be doing the talk shows for a couple of weeks and then will retire to a quiet life of corporate overlording.  Before the bounce, here's what  urlLink the latest NYT polls  had to say:  "The survey, which showed Mr. Bush's approval rating at 42 percent, also found that nearly 40 percent of Americans say they do not have an opinion about Senator John Kerry."  "45 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion of Mr. Bush himself, again the most negative measure the Times/CBS Poll has found since he took office. And 57 percent say the country is going in the wrong direction,"  "Nationwide, Mr. Kerry has the support of 45 percent of registered voters, with Mr. Bush supported by 44 percent. When Ralph Nader, who is running as an independent, is included, he draws 5 percent, leaving 42 percent for Mr. Kerry and 43 percent for Mr. Bush."   Nader who?   urlLink The Green Party candidate  ought to get at least as much press as Nader, eh?   "For all the signs of opposition to the war, Americans appear prepared to stay in Iraq until the situation becomes stable. The poll found that 54 percent of respondents said that the United States should remain in Iraq "as long as it takes," while 40 percent said the United States should withdraw "as soon as possible."    40 percent!  This was Dennis Kucinich's Radical Call throughout the primaries.     "About 60 percent of respondents said they disapproved of Mr. Bush's Iraq policy, while just over 50 percent said they disapproved of his foreign policy. Those disapproval figures are the highest measured in his presidency on those subjects."  "And 60 percent of respondents, including a majority of independents, said the war has not been worth the cost."  "In what could prove to be a particularly far-reaching development for Mr. Bush — especially because he and his campaign have sought to undercut Mr. Kerry's credibility — nearly 60 percent said he was not being entirely truthful when talking about Iraq. Similarly, just 15 percent said the administration had told the entire truth when it came to abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison."   Fif. Teen. Percent.   "By 51 to 32 percent, Americans believe that he [GWB]has divided the nation, rather than brought it together. The number of Americans who said that Mr. Bush did not care about the "needs and problems of people like you" edged up to 42 percent from 36 percent in March."  "45 percent of Americans say that the Bush administration has been responsible for a decline in jobs, compared with 24 percent who say it has brought an increase. Fifty-five percent of respondents said they were very or somewhat concerned that they or someone in their house would be out of work over the next year."   Despite BushCo's claims that the new jobs being created will raise the fortune of all Americans, it's clear that the 'new jobs' are a sham.  The 55% worried about losing their jobs can tell you more.   "Both men are disliked by more people than they are liked. The number of people who view Mr. Kerry unfavorably has jumped to 35 percent from 29 percent in mid-March, when Mr. Bush began a huge television advertising campaign against his opponent.  In Mr. Kerry's case, 36 percent said they had no opinion of him, despite the campaign's record-setting expenditure on television advertisements. That figure is fairly typical for challengers at this point in the campaign; in June 1992, 44 percent of the public did not have an opinion of Bill Clinton."   36% No Opinion  - This is the target audience.  Do you know these people?  Call them, write them, invite them over.  Kerry has the opportunity to snatch the spotlight away from Gen. GW Chickenhawk and make believers out of them, but he'll need to do it before Rove steers the mainstream media outlets into reporting that sovereignty and freedom are the calling cards of this Herculean wartime preznit.

          For information on the transfer of "Sovereignty" to Iraq, go to any news site on the planet.  But before you go a'clickin' down that yellow brick road, know that the definition of sovereignty is  urlLink this :  Main Entry:  sov·er·eign·ty  Variant: also sov·ran·ty /'sä-vr&n-tE, 's&-, -v&-r&n-/  Function: noun Inflected Form: plural -ties  1 a : supreme power esp. over a body politic b : freedom from external control : AUTONOMY 2 : one that is sovereign; especially : an autonomous state    Source: Merriam-Webster Dictionary of Law, © 1996 Merriam-Webster, Inc.    Who here thinks that this definition has anything to do with what happened today in Iraq?   urlLink Tom Dispatch  thinks:   "The only small problem with the whole discussion of sovereignty, of course, lies in recalcitrant Iraq which is now so darn sovereign that the Pentagon is madly figuring how to: withdraw troops from far-flung garrisons elsewhere on this small planet to reinforce our now-no-longer-occupying army of 138,000 in Iraq; extend the terms of duty of troops assigned to Iraq, despite contracts for the "volunteer" Army that say otherwise; and further bolster and  urlLink coordinate the mercenary army  of private "contractors" already there. This reflects the confidence the U.S. military has in the "sovereign" powers of the new Iraqi regime.   Of course, as Jonathan Schell has pointed out, one of the Bush administration's great fantasies may be that we ever possessed Iraqi sovereignty to give or withhold. In fact, as far as I can tell, there simply is no "sovereignty" in Iraq right now and very little control at all. Oil pipelines are being blown up daily; there are increasingly sophisticated ambushes on the outskirts of and inside Baghdad; near constant car bombings in the central city; assassinations and killings of everyone from second-level officials to former Baathist officers to Shiite truck drivers to university professors to anyone in any way connected to any kind of western organization of any sort."    We'll wait for the rhetoric to die down a bit before we dig into that one.  Moving on...  UPDATE:  The very large-brained  urlLink Juan Cole is on this like Bremer on an airplane .   urlLink Kos has the skinny  on two very important Supreme Court rulings that will have far reaching implications for the detainees at Gitmo as well as for the political futures of those who detained them.  The details of their detention will be leaked through their lawyers to the media for months and years to come.  An incisive take on the decisions is at  urlLink SCOTUS .  President Bush reminds the reporters gathered in Istanbul that,  urlLink "Iraqis know what we know, that the best way to defend yourself is to go on the offensive,"    On the other side of the world, a  urlLink war for oil  is shaping up between Japan and China - with Russia as an arbiter.  VP Dick Cheney has been showing us the angels of his lesser nature, and the Republicans who are likely to have conniptions when a female breast is revealed on television have to laugh it off as a 'boys will be boys' moment.  Josh Marshall has  urlLink the definitive take.   That's plenty on this day when MM's F9/11 is making the leap  urlLink from phenom to legend .  Enjoy your day, and do something.

           Winning this year's Emmy for most reluctantly covered story on Fox News : Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 is  urlLink #1 across America . The movie will draw millions of viewers, and the DVD release scheduled for September means that Michael Moore's statement will be heard by enough people to make the dismissivist conservative punditry contort with rage.   urlLink Billmon says it like this :   For years now, Limbaugh, Coulter and their inferior imitations have been passing offtheir      slanted misreadings, unproven allegations and flimsy lies as factual reporting. When caught out on a lie or a smear, they either ignore the evidence, or - like Limbaugh - retreat into the phony defense of arguing that all they're doing is expressing a subjective opinion. "I'm just in the entertainment business," Rush likes to say.  Well, now there's someone on the left who knows how to play their game, and play it brilliantly. Moore may be an egomaniac, and a huckster showman in the best (or worst) tradition of P.T. Barnum and Walter Winchell, but man, he's effective. He's learned to play the mainstream media like a Stradivarius.    On a soaked in smug glee note - Ofcom, which licenses commercial channels shown in Britain regardless of where they are based,  urlLink has filed its third complaint  against Rupert Murdoch's Fox News. "Fox News, the US news network owned by Rupert Murdoch, has been found in breach of British broadcasting rules for an on-air tirade that accused the BBC of "frothing-at-the-mouth anti-Americanism"."   George W. Bush approves of using  urlLink Hitler's image on his website  to help his constituents understand that Democrats are evil, crazy Nazis.   urlLink Sign the petition while you're at it .  UPDATE: The offending images have been taken down - well done.  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld spent some time this weekend shoring up the relationship with a key ally in BushCo's Global War on Terror (tm) - Moldova.  Moldova provides the international coalition with a significant fighting force of 35 men.   urlLink Rumsfeld visited  to review the Moldovan troops and received the news that Moldova will be sending 19 more men, these equipped to disarm mines (source: CNN, 6/26/04).  Then today Rumsfeld was quoted as taking the Russians to task for their treatment of the tiny nation.  Who says this coalition isn't fraying around the edges?  The Secretary of Defense is having to do Moldova favors simply to maintain an illusion of multinationalism in this effort.   urlLink Doonesbury  gets it exactly right regarding Sovereignty (tm).  An excellent compilation of the threads of the Torture Scandal at  urlLink ScoopAgonist .  For those of you who like your news salacious - here are  urlLink Jeri Ryan's briefs  at the Smoking Gun.  With a wink of the eye to our own Intrepid Advocate, The National Association of Evangelicals warns against overtly allying Christianity with Republicanism,  urlLink "lest nonbelievers think that Christian faith is essentially political in nature."     urlLink The Green Party's 2004 presidential ticket .

      No this isn't about getting a girl pregnant. I'm curious as to when people think we should leave Iraq. Let's say Kerry wins in November and later in the year Iraq is in the same state of affairs it is in right now. Should we pull out of there completely and say the hell with it? I'm yanked two ways on this question. I feel as a nation it is our moral responsibility, after invading and killing thousands Iraqis plus losing hundreds of our own soldiers, that we owe it to them to rebuild Iraq and deliver on our promise. On the otherhand that means 100s maybe 1000s of more American and Iraqi lives taken. Since I sure as hell wouldn't let my own son go over there to fight, how can I expect someone else to and therefore how can I feel any other way than to get us out of there as soon as possible.

      ok, im just back from seeing f911. it was explosive, but not in the sense i had thought it would be. i thought it would be a anti-bush, proliberal, lovefest with lots of michael moore in it.  to my great joy, it wasnt. it seemed neither pro-democrat/liberal or anti-republican/conservative. what it did seem to be was pro-average american. it was filmed in layman's terms, easy to follow and understand. all the politicians who advocated or simply stood by and nodded, for the iraq war all get painted with the same brush.   moore seems happy to let those main characters have enough "on camera" rope to hang themselves, or come across as decent misled, "duped" is moore's word, citizens of a country who has lost its way.  the line here in asheville was long and they turned plenty of people away, but the general population in the line seemed to be people who already knew of our being duped; now if i can just convince my "america can do no wrong/we love us some george bush" relatives to see this film, i may have actually contributed.   ok enough, read the review below, cease_fire is more eloquent.

          urlLink Bloodiest day yet  since Mission Accomplished (Support Our Troops  urlLink HERE , support Iraqi civilians  urlLink HERE ).  Majority of Americans say the  urlLink War in Iraq was a mistake .   urlLink Bush interrogated  for over an hour by Plame investigators. Supreme Court tells lower court how to do its job, and the  urlLink Cheney secrecy story  is alive in the press for at least six more months.   urlLink Imperial Hubris , authored by someone the Bushies can't attack directly without raising the whole Plame specter, is coming on strong as well.  Nothing, of course, will trump the noise made by tomorrow's nationwide opening of  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 .  Spin, DJ Karl, Spin.  BushCo. asserts its sovereignty by  urlLink immunizing troops against prosecution  in Iraq.  And this just as more details of  urlLink Abu Ghraib cover-ups  and allegations of more extensive violations of international law emerge, " urlLink Torture is only the tip of the iceberg ," said Roger Normand, an international lawyer who directs the Center. "From unlawful killings, mass arrests, and collective punishment to outright theft and pillage, the U.S. is violating almost every law intended to protect civilians living under foreign military occupation."  None of this had to happen.  Bush, Cheney, Rice, Wolfowitz, Perle, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Chalabi, Blair, Brown - they are all to blame.  Al Gore puts it like  urlLink this .  Take some time today to consider what part you'll play in seeking justice: writing letters to the editor to spread the truth, volunteering for a local campaign to help unseat the lying liars who bloodied our hands, registering to vote, calling everyone you know to make sure they're aware of the depth of the problem, helping a soldier's family, helping an Iraqi civilian, etc.  Do something.  You'll feel better, and the world will be better by each good deed.

         With only hours before  urlLink Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11  opens nationwide, the wind machine has been turned on and soon all you'll be able to hear is the whir of spin.  Fortunately, for the Big Guy and the nation, the movie will speak for itself.  Of course, it doesn't hurt to  urlLink have Chris Lehane ready  to kick somebody's can if they slander or libel the filmmaker in any way.  Christopher Hitchens and the boys at Slate want the first butt whoopin'.  He  urlLink slams the Big Guy  in standard GOP fashion – Calls him crazy, delineates a small part of his argument, calls that crazy, then chooses a few uncheckable facts to prove that the crazy argument from the crazy man is dangerous, un-American, hateful, and morally reprehensible.   Look for a lot of this in the next several weeks. Fahrenheit 9/11 is one chapter in the greater unfolding serial of Michael Moore Vs. the Guys In Charge, and Chris Lehane is just as likely as Karl Rove to play Snidely Whiplash.  There will also be oodles of Moore defenders in the media as represented by the NYT, that bastion of unrepentant kool-aid drinkers,  urlLink HERE.   The heavy wallet crowd is angry because Moore took a page out of their book, "Control the terms of the debate".  Carlyle is not going to get mad though, they're going to get even.   urlLink Carlyle Group is moving to acquire Loews Cineplex Entertainment for 1.46 billion .

          There is no substantive link between Al Qaeda and the former Iraqi government led by Saddam Hussein.  It doesn't matter, Mr. Cheney, how often you assert the contrary.  It doesn't matter, Mr. Bush, how much you want to believe it.  No Link.  Let's review shall we?   urlLink "He was a patron of terrorism ... He had long-established ties with al-Qaeda." - Vice President Dick Cheney on Saddam Hussein, June 14   "I have not seen smoking-gun, concrete evidence about the connection." - Secretary of State Colin Powell, June 10   "We have no credible evidence that Iraq and al-Qaeda cooperated on attacks against the United States." - 9-11 Commission, June 16   Confronted with the 9/11 Commission's report this week, which stated there was no collaborative relationship between al Qaeda and Saddam, the White House refuses to admit  to misleading the public. President Bush said, "This administration never said that the 9/11 attacks were orchestrated between Saddam and al Qaeda. We did say there were numerous contacts between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda." But he is playing semantic games which distort undisputable facts. Top officials in the Bush administration – including the president and the vice president – have repeatedly cited a collaborative relationship - not just contacts - between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda as a justification for invading Iraq. Now, after months of careful study, the bi-partisan commission investigating 9/11 says there is no credible evidence to support that claim. But instead of taking responsibility for their actions, the administration has continued to weave a  urlLink web of deception .   urlLink Billmon at Whiskey Bar  uncovers the deeper strategy, "What the gang seems to be doing here is testing the outside of the Orwellian envelope a little bit, to see if they can get away with such a flagrant display of "up-is-downism." I don't think I've ever seen such an utterly naked ploy from these guys before. Perhaps they've stumbled, wittingly or unwittingly, across the same insight Joseph Goebbels had all those years ago: The bigger the lie, the more likely it is to be accepted, since the audience will be reluctant to believe its leaders would tell them such a monstrous untruth."   Transcript, CNBC’s “Capital Report,” June 17, 2004    Gloria Borger : “Well, let’s get to Mohammed Atta for a minute, because you mentioned him as well.  You have said in the past that it was quote, “pretty well confirmed.”    Vice President Cheney : No, I never said that.   BORGER : OK.    Vice Pres. CHENEY : Never said that.    BORGER : I think that is...    Vice Pres. CHENEY : Absolutely not.   Transcript, NBC’s “Meet the Press,” December 9, 2001.    Vice-President Cheney : “It’s been pretty well confirmed that he did go to Prague and he did meet with a senior official of the Iraqi intelligence service in Czechoslovakia last April.”    urlLink (source)   This is the best that the Bush/Cheney apologists can do:   urlLink "The commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks has been told "a very prominent member" of al Qaeda served as an officer in Saddam Hussein's militia, a panel member said on Sunday."    So, let me get this right... We invaded Iraq, killing at least ten thousand civilians because an Al Qaeda guy was in Saddam's army?   Does this mean that if a U.S. soldier is an undercover Al Qaeda guy that we'll have to invade ourselves?  Or will we ask the French and Germans to send troops?    This Al Qaeda connection is the last legal reason Bush has for this war.  The WMD (remember who gave Saddam those missing weapons?  If you guessed  urlLink Ronald Reagan [R.I.P. tm] and Donald Rumsfeld , you're right!) aren't turning up, and the congressional act authorizing Bush to invade Iraq expressly allows it only if Bush can prove that the Iraqi government in some way aided the terrorist group(s) responsible for attacks on U.S. soil.   The Ducks Are In The Barrel.

      The nation's Scrutiny Hooligans approved a  urlLink STATEMENT  on Monday on "Catholic Bishops in Political Life" that brands Catholic bishops who support priests who abuse children as "cooperating in evil" and leaves the door open for Scrutiny Hooligans to deny communion to such bishops.  The Hooligans, meeting outside Asheville, stopped short of saying that those bishops should be forbidden to take communion. But they reminded all Catholic bishops that they were not worthy to receive communion until they had  urlLink EXAMINED THEIR CONSCIENCES , including their "fidelity to the  urlLink MORAL TEACHINGS  of the church in personal and public life."

          There is a group trying to stop Moore's film from being  urlLink SHOWN IN MOST THEATERS . The name of this group is  urlLink MOVEAMERICAFORWARD , and they feel the best way to go about this is to stifle free speech and ban movies, books, tv shows with which they do not agree(remember the Reagan documentary?) This group was started by the same PR firm that lead the charge to stop that one.   There are a couple of ways you can help. First, buy your tickets before the release date! Second, tonight, tomorrow, right now you can use this link to contact the owners of many of the  urlLink LARGEST THEATER CHAINS  and let them know how much you appreciate their support of free speech.  Or, as Screwy Hoolie mentioned in an earlier post:  "They are trying to  urlLink Stop Michael Moore's  message from getting out. The big guy  urlLink isn't taking it  lying down, and neither should you.    urlLink Atrios  tells you what to do."  PLUS: A little f911 talkup from  urlLink Roger Ebert!   Go get em ya'll....

      First, who's going to be the Hooligans' offical  urlLink Clinton memoir  reviewer?  It's difficult to look at the facts coming out of Iraq day after day.  However, longer, more comprehensive looks at Bush's war of choice can help to gather all the bloody facts into a bundle - easier for carrying.   urlLink The Washington Post has an excellent look  at where we are in Iraq.  George Bush and the Capitol Gang don't like to talk about Iraq like there's anything wrong.  So,  urlLink when they kill some women and children in a missile strike , they like to continue to pretend that the war in Iraq is the war on terrah.  After Cheney stirred up a shitstorm last week by again repeating the oft-debunked claim that Iraq and Al Qaeda were in cahoots,  urlLink even the 9/11 commission said, "Wha?!"   Good thing Mr. Bush is such a strong leader, or he might not be able to  urlLink keep reiterating  what every media outlet, commission, and investigation believes is unsupportable.  There's lots more  urlLink Bush Evildoing  to talk about, but first some good news from the Kerry campaign: 1.  Kerry seizes a winning issue:  urlLink raising the absurdly low Minimum Wage.  2.  The Bush machine just  urlLink can't put a dent in this guy . Also  urlLink HERE . 3.  The format and timing  urlLink Presidential and Vice-Presidential debates  have been announced.  And, for those of you following North Carolina's 11th congressional district, Patsy Keever has been raking in  urlLink endorsements  and volunteers.  Yours truly will be heading up a letter writing initiative.  If you want to get involved contact me or the campaign.   urlLink North Carolina Democratic Party Platform  (draft).  Following up on Uptown Ruler's assertion that a draft is on the way,  urlLink Doonesbury  asserts that it's already underway.  ...so much more to tell...more tomorrow...comments?

      Anyone recall that our GWB was supposed to be giving  urlLink "a series of prime-time speeches"  leading up to the June 30 change in the way people talk about Iraq? Kos does.  This is  urlLink what Sovereignty means  according to Dictionary.com  I believe the Bushies are using definition number 4.  And if you want to attend a protest anytime next year, Watch Your Ass:   urlLink "Weapons that can incapacitate crowds of people by sweeping a lightning-like beam of electricity across them are being readied for sale to military and police forces in the US and Europe."   If you read only one article today - Make it  urlLink THIS ONE  from Spencer Ackerman sitting in for Josh Marshall at TPM, "The best way to look at it is to look at his [Ahmed Chalabi's] relationship with United States intelligence, or his relationship with Turkish intelligence, Syrian intelligence, Kuwaiti intelligence, Jordanian intelligence. He is an Iraqi intelligence officer. He is representing Iraqi interests."  And if that makes you mad as a hatter and you want to be able to do something about it even though you feel under the thumb of The Man -  urlLink The Boss V. The Bush – Sign the petition .  The Blogfather tells us that BushCo’s unemployment numbers don’t describe reality:   urlLink   May unemployment was 9.7%     You’ve seen the trailer for The Hunting of the President?  Yeah, I know it’s not F911, but what is?   urlLink Just go watch it.   Finally, I got my  urlLink selective service board member application  in the mail too.  Spread the word.  Uptown Ruler and I are going to drop our packages into the box tomorrow.

      about two months ago, i applied online to become a local  urlLink DRAFT BOARD MEMBER .  today, my offical application found its way into my mailbox. inside, i found a greeting letter from mr. greg frederick with instructions on how to fill out a rather official looking application, wanting more detailed bits of information. also included were a pamplet titled "board member information booklet," a photocopy of a chicago tribune piece on the draft, and the application itself.    earlier in the year, the pentagon began quietly looking for more local draft board members to  urlLink FILL THE BOARD RANKS  and the defense department also posted a page on their website called  urlLink DEFEND AMERICA .    Several senators have renewed the call for a  urlLink DRAFT .    two draft bills are working their way through congress, urlLink S. 89 AND HR 163 . furthermore,  urlLink  28 MILLION  dollars, up from 26million last year, was alloted for the selective service.   hearing rumsfield, bush, and the pentagon repeat: "there are no draft plans, there are no draft plans" doesnt make me feel any better, nor change the fact i have the application sitting in my lap. i'm gonna fill it out, despite its 20 year commitment, and the fact that many people won't understand that i joined the board to keep kids from going, rather than to send them to war.  if you dont think there are people in our government who are advocating for long term warfare in the middle east and beyond, i recommend you visit the  urlLink PNAC  and read their piece titled  urlLink REBUILDING AMERICA .   then i recommend, you visit  urlLink PNACINFO  and read a little more. its lot to ask i know, but the truth is somewhere in the mix, and the truth needs to out.

      From CNN - "The panel investigating the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks found "no credible evidence that Iraq and al Qaeda cooperated on attacks against the United States," according to a staff report issued on Wednesday.  The report contradicts statements from the Bush administration that Saddam Hussein had ties to al Qaeda.  In response, a senior administration official traveling with President Bush in Tampa, Florida, said, "We stand by what Powell and Tenet have said," referring to previous statements by Secretary of State Colin Powell and CIA Director George Tenet that described such links."   --- If find it funny they are standing by the comments of Tenet who is blamed for gathering bad intelligence and Powell who has publically stated he regrets what he said before the war.

      Nail your shoes to the floor, kids, because full throttle American Political Rhetoric is kicking in, and staying grounded in the facts will become extremely difficult once it does.  Remember that the next three months will transform the Preznit and JFK into unrecognizable heroes, unspeakable villains.  Now's the time to stake your claim to your candidate, know why you're voting for him.   The river Bullshit is rising.  See how many unsupported charges you can find in the words of both candidates in  urlLink this LA Times article .  I won't forget that the first, most important order of business is to dethrone King George.  However, this election also offers us an opportunity to alter the political process and energize Americans to participate in their country.    If you missed it the first time, Atrios tells you what to look out for  urlLink HERE .  If you're looking for something to support rather than something to rail against, try  urlLink DFA ,  urlLink JFK , or  urlLink Team Keever .  Hold on tight...

      The term "Peak Oil" comes in reference from  urlLink Hubbert's Peak . Where it is true most people do not like getting bad news, the fact which lies before us is simple: at some point in the not too distant future, world oil reserves will be used up. Geologists have made predictions ranging from oil production peaking in the 1970's to around 2010.  Regardless of the peak or decline, the nations of the world should consider thinking about gearing up for the  urlLink decline  so that we are not caught in a bind.  One can already see the change in  urlLink foodprices , but did you know that we literally are eating  urlLink fossil fuels ? The sky isn't falling; however, the reality is we are running out of oil. Kurt Vonnegut said it best,  urlLink ,"We are all addicts of fossil fuels in a state of denial, about to face cold turkey."

      As we witness the  urlLink continuing violence  against U.S. troops and the multinational coalition of mercenaries and war profiteers, I'm often left wondering what life is like in Iraq.  Not CPA life or PFC life, but living and working there.    Baghdad Burning is a wonderful source for this, but the posts are infrequent.  I've stumbled across some excellent writing by Christopher Allbritton, a former AP and New York Daily News journalist, who is currently filing stories for TIME.   urlLink Read about what it's really like.   As we get spun out by GWspeak, "transfer of sovereignty" to "grateful Iraqis", let's remember that real people are leading lives as real as ours in that mess of a country.

      It's time to ask Preznit GWB about  urlLink some torturin' .  Torturin'?  GW's been a'torturin'?  Well, maybe so, and maybe not.  Depends what you mean by torturin'.  If you mean that GW's been'a'securin' our freedoms, then a little butt-rapin' isn't going to bother you...right? Not if it's lawful...right?  --full transcript of 6-10 press conference  urlLink here --  "THE PRESIDENT: No, the authorization I issued, David, was that anything we did would conform to U.S. law and would be consistent with international treaty obligations. That's the message I gave our people.   Q Have you seen the memos?   THE PRESIDENT: I can't remember if I've seen the memo or not, but I gave those instructions."     "Q Returning to the question of torture, if you knew a person was in U.S. custody and had specific information about an imminent terrorist attack that could kill hundreds or even thousands of Americans, would you authorize the use of any means necessary to get that information and to save those lives?   THE PRESIDENT: Jonathan, what I've authorized is that we stay within U.S. law."    Well, I've seen  urlLink the memo , Mr. Preznit, your team saw it too.  We know you don't read much, but didja read that whole part of the oath of office where you're supposed to uphold the laws of the land?  Well, while you're telling folks to stay within the law, they're trying to reinterpret that law so that anything they do, up to and including  urlLink outing CIA operatives , is A-ok:   "THE PRESIDENT: Yes. And that's up to the U.S. Attorney to find the facts.   Q My final point would be -- or question would be, has Vice President Cheney assured you --   THE PRESIDENT: It's up to the --   Q -- subsequent to his conversations with them, that nobody --   THE PRESIDENT: I haven't talked to the Vice President about this matter, and I suggest -- recently -- and I suggest you talk to the U.S. Attorney about that."    You haven't talked to him about it?  Really?  Bizarre.  You haven't spoken with your Vice President about a treasonous offense alleged against him?  C'mon...really?  C'mon...   "Q Mr. President, I wanted to return to the question of torture. What we've learned from these memos this week is that the Department of Justice lawyers and the Pentagon lawyers have essentially worked out a way that U.S. officials can torture detainees without running afoul of the law. So when you say that you want the U.S. to adhere to international and U.S. laws, that's not very comforting. This is a moral question: Is torture ever justified?   THE PRESIDENT: Look, I'm going to say it one more time. If I -- maybe -- maybe I can be more clear. The instructions went out to our people to adhere to law. That ought to comfort you. We're a nation of law. We adhere to laws. We have laws on the books. You might look at those laws, and that might provide comfort for you. And those were the instructions out of -- from me to the government. "   Hm.  The instructions were for them to follow the laws...ok...and the laws say torturin' is bad...ok...ok...and the United States Department of Defense codified procedures that fell outside these laws, and the United States Department of Justice said that breaking the law would be justified...ok...and people were tortured and killed.  So much for that 'a few bad apples' meme you guys had going for a few days there, eh?     The ducks are in the barrel.    UPDATE:  The WaPo is ready to make the Bushies dance, and dKos has an excellent summary:   urlLink READ THIS.

      In today's NYT, Johnathan Glater  urlLink relates a Texas 'controversy'  that well illustrates a fundamental difference between the Republican and Democratic parties.  Republicans are more likely to argue that only those with the highest merit should benefit from advancement in society.

      Rush Limbaugh, that relentless conservative headline grabber is at it again.  His  urlLink biggest fan  is moving to the critics' corner.  I heard him last week snarling at a tech while on-the-air, "I'm in a bad mood today. I don't have to tell you why.  It's enough for you to know I'm in a bad mood."  Hearing that your wife has had enough of your being a  urlLink Lying Blowhard  would dampen any megalomaniac's day.

      The last thing that this movie is going to need is any more hype, so I'm going to get some opinion in before the media universe is overwhelmed with punditry on the subject.   urlLink Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11  is going to be the biggest shit-stirrer since Otto declared himself Pope.  Moore has hired Chris Lehane as a political consultant.  The L.A. Times is on  urlLink the story .  Googling  urlLink George W. Bush  = 4,940,000 results Googling  urlLink Michael Moore  = 5,980,000  It's going to be untenable for Racicot, et al. to call  urlLink John Kerry  a liberal while Michael Moore, from the savagely funny democratic wing of the democratic party, lumbers into the fray looking as big as Bill Clinton (oh,  urlLink he has a book  or something, right?).  Rove will try to tie Kerry to Moore, but could they really be more different?  It's like trying to tie George W. Bush to the Reagan Brand.  They're just two different things, and it won't be hard for folks to see that. Moore's commentary will focus the media on Bush's glaring inconsistencies and arrogance while adding the piece that the dems have been trying to learn to sell - compassion.  For too long, the right has tried to radicalize kindness or, in the case of George W. Bush, co-opt the word but apply it to its polar opposite.  That's what the Bushies are best at, and that's what Moore is exposing.  I love this guy.  Welcome to center stage Big Mike, good luck in the crucible.

      The Republican Party is deadly afraid of the power of the liberal 527s.  They figured that $180 million raised before March would more than take care of them.

      Treason, torture, evil, and greed aside, there's good news in North Carolina's 11th Congressional District (encompassing 15 counties in mountainous western NC).  What has been a safe Republican seat under the flaccid cheeks of Mulitmillionaire Banker turned 14-year congressman  urlLink Charles Taylor  is turning into a fine pickup opportunity for the Democrats.  Buncombe County Commissioner  urlLink Patsy Keever  is already making a strong run against an incumbent stung by recent accusations of financial malfeasance in his Blue Ridge Savings and Loan Bank.    Patsy Keever taught school for 25 years and has served on the county commission for 12.  She's been the President of the North Carolina Association of Educators.  She is not only well recognized, she is genuinely well-known by the people she seeks to represent.  This support materializes in the form of a well-coordinated grass roots volunteer team.  As of Tuesday night, Team Keever had over 400 volunteers.  They are aiming for a thousand volunteers by August, and they're well ahead of schedule.    The money is coming together well, thanks to support from the DCCC, an excellent campaign local fund-raising effort, and phone banking.  Charles Taylor is worth about $94million, so if he decides to throw money at this campaign, he could bury Keever.  But would that win him the election?  Not in this political environment.  This one is going to be won by the person who can Get Out The Vote, and Keever's campaign is working overtime to make sure it happens.  Keever is running primarily on three themes - Education Funding, Health Care, and Time for Change.  Her campaign fliers also point to economic growth, protection of natural resources, and preserving Appalachian mountain culture.  Taylor is a millionaire redneck who dyes his hair and wears pancake makeup (I got WAY too close once).  He sits on the Appropriations committee where he votes according to Denny Hastert.  He's into clearcutting and cutting veterans' health care.  He's a dead man walking.  No polling data yet, but I'm expecting some before the summer is out.

      I read  urlLink the resolution , and I'm fascinated by what the mainstream media chose to explore.  My first question is what is going on when the three sponsors of the resolution are the United Kingdom, the United States, and Romania.  Romania?  WTF?  Second, I'd like to know if the Kerry campaign is going to come out and take credit for the Bush/U.N. initiative.  They really ought to, but, that aside, there is some nasty, scary, misleading, lying nonsense in this thing that will never be read by most of the american people.  "Recognizing the request conveyed in the letter of 5 June 2004  from the Prime Minister of the Interim Government of Iraq  to the President of the Council, which is annexed to this resolution, to retain the presence of the multinational force,"   So, let me get this straight, you're recognizing that an American appointee is the Prime Minister, right?  Because this is not a  urlLink Muslim George Washington  running the show.   The appointed Prime Minister is a CIA freeper whose opposition to Saddam Hussein is touted as his resume topper.     "Reaffirms the right of the Iraqi people freely to determine their own political future and to exercise  full authority and control over their financial and natural resources ;"   The Iraqi people, led by an American appointee for the moment, will have nothing to say about the Iraqi financial and natural resources, not until contracts with Bechtel, Halliburton, etc. have been renegotiated by a freely elected Iraqi government.   "b) convening of a national conference reflecting the diversity of Iraqi society; and"   Who will invite the diverse peoples to the conference?  Who will decide who attends the diverse peoples' conference?  The American appointed government?   "(c) holding of direct democratic elections by 31 December 2004 if possible, and in no case later than 31 January 2005, to  a Transitional National Assembly , which  will, inter alia, have responsibility for forming a Transitional Government of Iraq and drafting a permanent constitution  for Iraq leading to a constitutionally elected government by 31 December 2005; "   This will be amazing to watch. And what does 'inter alia' mean?    "17. Condemns all acts of terrorism in Iraq, reaffirms  the obligations of Member States under resolutions 1373 (2001) of 28 September 2001, 1267 (1999) of 15 October 1999, 1333 (2000) of 19 December 2000, 1390 (2002) of 16 January 2002, 1455 (2003) of 17 January 2003, and 1526 (2004) of 30 January 2004 , and other relevant international obligations with respect, inter alia, to terrorist activities in and from Iraq or against its citizens, and specifically reiterates its call upon Member States to prevent the transit of terrorists to and from Iraq, arms for terrorists, and financing that would support terrorists, and re-emphasizes the importance of strengthening the cooperation of the countries of the region, particularly neighbours of Iraq, in this regard;"    What are these?  What does this mean?   "20. Reiterates its  request that Member States, international financial institutions and other organizations  strengthen their efforts to  assist  the people of Iraq in the reconstruction and development of  the Iraqi economy , including by providing international experts and necessary resources through a coordinated programme of donor assistance;"    A call for other nations to help pay for the occupation and an invitation to an IMF, World Bank, Multinational Corporation feeding frenzy.   "23. Calls on Member States and international organizations to respond to Iraqi requests to assist Iraqi efforts to integrate Iraqi veterans and former militia members into Iraqi society;"       Is this saying that they're going to need Social Workers and Counselors in Iraq?  Is this saying that someone is going to pay them?  I'll need to tell my friends.  At least G.W. is creating worthwhile jobs somewhere.   "24. Notes that, upon dissolution of the Coalition Provisional Authority, the funds in  the Development Fund for Iraq  shall be disbursed solely at the direction of the Government of Iraq, and decides that the Development Fund for Iraq  shall be utilized  in a transparent and equitable manner and through the Iraqi budget including  to satisfy outstanding obligations against the Development Fund for Iraq ,  that the arrangements for the depositing of proceeds from export sales of petroleum, petroleum products, and natural gas established in paragraph 20 of resolution 1483 (2003) shall continue to apply, that the International Advisory and Monitoring Board shall continue its activities in monitoring the Development Fund for Iraq and shall include as an additional full voting member a duly qualified individual designated by the Government of Iraq  and that appropriate arrangements shall be made for the continuation of deposits of the proceeds referred to in paragraph 21 of resolution 1483 (2003);"   This says that the American appointed government will be in charge of their own money, but it also says that the American appointed government will be responsible to uphold every lousy contract the CPA signed.    And that theme continues:   "26. Decides that, in connection with the dissolution of the Coalition Provisional Authority,  the Interim Government of Iraq and its successors shall assume the rights, responsibilities and obligations relating to the Oil-for-Food Programme that were transferred to the Authority, including all operational responsibility for the Programme and any obligations undertaken by the Authority in connection with such responsibility , and responsibility for ensuring independently authenticated confirmation that goods have been delivered, and further decides that, following a 120-day transition period from the date of adoption of this resolution,  the Interim Government of Iraq and its successors shall assume responsibility for certifying delivery of goods under previously prioritized contracts , and that such certification shall be deemed to constitute the independent authentication required for the release of funds associated with such contracts, consulting as appropriate to ensure the smooth implementation of these arrangements;"  "28. Welcomes the commitments of  many creditors including those of the Paris Club, to identify ways to reduce substantially Iraq's sovereign debt, calls on Member States, as well as internationa1 and regional organizations, to  support the Iraq reconstruction effort , urges the international financial institutions and bilateral donors to take the immediate steps necessary to provide their full range of loans and other financial assistance and arrangements to Iraq,  recognizes that the Interim Government of Iraq will have the authority to conclude and implement such agreements and other arrangements as may be necessary in this regard, and requests creditors, institutions and donors to work as a priority on these matters with the Interim Government of Iraq and its successors; "   More international monetary feeding frenzy.   In closing,  There's a lot to like in this resolution if you have no sense of the past 25 years leading up to it.  This is a document intended, as stated by Advocate, to take the Democratic center while ensuring that the money stays in the hands of the greediest, those least likely to raise political issue with our own duly elected President Bush's policies in the "Global War on Terror".  I've stayed up too late and rambled too long.  What did you think of the damned thing?

An old man once called me a communist when I voiced the opinion that Ronald Reagan completely screwed our country when it came to fighting terrorism. I still haven’t figured out how that opinion makes me someone who wants to destroy capitalism, but I guess that really wasn’t the point.

      Well,      you can all stop being jealous. Unlike the beaches and the temples and the charming markets I have spent the last month, the jungle of Khlong Krua Wai has leeches. A man can't say he's lived until he's pulled leeches out of his drawers, I tell you. Well, maybe he can. But, for what it's worth, my life has a broader feel thanks to the experience.      Leeches. The little bastard children of some unholy coupling of snake and worm.      Leeches aside, the forest here is incredible. It's the most untouched part of the world I have ever seen. Generally, when one thinks of hiking in the jungle, we think of trails through lush green vines and overgrown trees and canopies that shadow out the world. That's pretty much right except for the trails part. there are none. The only thing I follow are old animal trails (most of which were designed by creatures decidelty smaller than 6'4"). Khlong Krua Wai Wildlife Sanctuary covers about 400 km2 of incredible montane rain forest that sits on the Cambodian border (for those of you rushing to your atlas, go east of Bangkok about 300 km, and a little south. You'll see a town called Chantuburi - I'm about 70 km north of that and in the middle of absolutely nowhere. It is beatiful, if a bit isolated.     And what do I do here, besides remove overly friendly leeches? I have designed a long term (and possibly overly optimistic) ecological assessment of this forest. This will be used to assess the viability and planning of a potential release of captive Asiatic Black bears (who are sitting patiently in Banglumon waiting for me to get on with it).      At the moment, I am the only one who speaks English anywhere near here. There is a staff of rangers at "Headquarters" all of whom are very friendly and I am sure wonder what I am doing here. The ranger who has intitially become my guide and shephard is named "Ma" (I think). He is exceedingly friendly and can count to 7 in English. That's it. I can already count to 7 in Thai, so we sort of cancel each other out. As the rest of my Thai is currently limited to conversation about food, our dialogue is somewhat disjointed. Today he showed me the track of an animal called a "moo pah" which looks to me like a type of wild pig but might be, by Ma's hand gestures, be a toaster oven. I also learned that he is either one of 7 children, he has 7 children, or he has 7 testicles. I tend to reply to most of his statements or questions with "Thank you, hello. Me big delicious foreigner. Good noodles." We are getting along fabulously.     So that is me, for the time being. I still have no mailing address, though I will work on that. I am in the booming metropolis of Makham right now, getting some supplies. They have an internet cafe of sorts, but I cannot be sure how often I will be getting here. I'll keep you posted.    I miss you all (even the ones who haven't been e-mailing). Love, James

      There is a portion of my extended family that, I've just learned, is rabidly pro-war.  y Uncle Aubrey sent around a vicious missive calling anyone who has a problem w/Bush et al. pantywaist maggots (he also like the term 'sand nigger').  My own brother is what I'd call a Reagan Democrat who plans to vote for Bush again and who believes that the war in Iraq is justifiable as part of greater effort to liberate tghe oppressed people of the world.  These are a couple of email responses I sent to them.  Let's continue to find ways to articulate our views.  ---->  As citizens of the most powerful nation in the history of the world, it is our privelege, duty, honor, and responsibility to cast our votes according to our consciences.  To vote based on what's in our own best interest isn't enough.  We have to look at the bigger picture.  We have to look globally, and we have to try to peer into time to guess which leader might take us closer to a lasting peace.  I'm not naive.  I've learned too much since November, 2000 to be naive.  I know that one man, be it GW or JFK, is not the end all - be all.  But I've learned from watching the current administration that they hold values that are contradictory to those values I was taught in high school civics class.     I was taught that individuals are innocent until proven guilty - this means we can't throw away the Geneva Conventions no matter how scared we are.  I was taught that free speech is a fundamental right that can not be infringed upon and that should be not impugned - this means that patriotic dissent is a service to our nation.  I was taught that America doesn't wage war except as a last resort - this means that we don't bomb a nation (even a nation with a nasty leader like SHussein) for reasons that change as circumstances demand (reasons that continue to ring false - no WMD, no meaningful connection to Al Qaeda, falsehoods told to our willing govt. by an opportunist who told our secrets to the Iranians, falsehoods our leaders latched onto with all the zeal of teenage virgins in a New Orleans whorehouse).  I was taught that we don't make treaties with nations who threaten us - This means that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, our central allies in this misguided war on terror, should not receive our gentility.  GWBush and Co. have abandoned American values in order to secure an absurd idea of security.     And are we safer today than we were on September 11th, 2001?  There have been more international terrorist attacks since 9/11/01 than in all the years before it.  President Bush outlined many of these attacks in recent speeches.  We are building the case of our enemies.  If America is perceived globally as an economic, militaristic, ideological, and religious bully, then the war is already lost.  I believe that global sentiment will hinge on the next election, and those foriegners who disdain Bush's global policies will judge the United States based on how we vote in November.  A vote for Bush is a vote for war and death.  A vote for Kerry is vote for hope and reconciliation.  The existing terrorists don't give a damn who's president, but the next wave of recruits stands waiting in the wings to see whether America will turn down a path of peace or one of perpetual war.   I have much more to say on this and other subjects, but long rants via email are tiring.  I'll stop and breathe now.  If you'd like more information on what's going on, I direct you to the following news sources:   www.cursor.org www.dailykos.com www.atrios.blogspot.com www.talkingpointsmemo.com www.agonist.org www.democracyforamerica.com   Vote Democrat - The Ass you save may be your own.   Gordon  ------------>  Re: The war in Iraq:   Had America in the wake of 9/11 formulated a new global foreign policy stance based on liberating the oppressed peoples of the world, then we might have this conversation about our invading Iraq to liberate its oppressed people.  But that's not what happened.  George W. Bush, Colin Powell, Condi Rice, etc. told the world that Iraq posed an imminent threat to the security of the United States and to the world.  They told the world that we could not afford to wait another moment or else the very worst imaginable horrors might rain down upon each and every one of us.  They insinuated that anyone who disagreed with this was siding with the terrorists.   Now, of course, it has been revealed that there are no weapons, no imminent threat to our national security, no meaningful relationship with Al Qaeda.  And now we search for other reasons to justify our nation's aggression.  It may well be true that Iraqis are celebrating daily their good fortune at having our troops on their streets, but let's not pretend for a minute that our nation justified going to war based on compassion and love for the Iraqi people.  The Bush administration lied to the world in order to promote a broad brush political theory, a reverse domino theory, which holds that creating a democracy in the middle east will create more democracies and democracies are inherently good.  Side effects of this strategy include 1) U.S. corporations making outrageous amounts of money due to the fact that we undermanned the invasion and must depend on outsourcing; 2) The Arab world sees that America is willing to kill 10,000 civilians and counting in order to bring democracy to the middle east (for photos of dead babies, do a couple of google searches); 3) The Arab world sees that the Bush administration, never having retracted its assertion that WMD exist in Iraq, is now trying to change the justification for the war - Some call this lying and manipulation; 4) Since the reasons for the invasion are evidently mutable, thousands of conspiracy theorists across the world have been advancing their own theories as to why we invaded (Oil, Greed, Racism, Pro-Israeli agenda, Christian Holy War, Facism, NeoConservative Cabals, etc.), and these theories, wacky as they may be are heard and considered right alongside the Bush administrations shifting explanations; 5) George W. Bush has created an environment that serves as a picture-perfect recruiting tool for terrorists of every stripe.     The Bush administration has no intention of saving the world.  No mention of the current horrors in Congo, Zaire, Uganda, Tibet, Libya, Bolivia.  To suddenly regard the Bush foreign policy as a stroke of compassionate conservatism is to disregard everything the administration said in the run-up to the war.     Only a global alliance against terrorism will quell terrorism, and the Bush Administration does not play well with others.     If the United States promotes itself as the world's policeman, then it must obey a rule of law.  The Bush administration has, since day one, shown an unerring intention to ignore those laws it perceives as inconvenient (Geneva Conventions, Trade laws, Human Rights laws) and to back out of treaties unilaterally (arms, trade, environmental).  Remember how belligerent the administration was in its early days when China shot down one of our spy planes?  This administration planned for the war in Iraq since 1999.  It was a war they intended to fight for ideological reasons that they did not present to the American people or to the world in an honest fashion.  I still don't know why we did it.  I can't figure it out at all.   I'm all for working towards liberation of the world's peoples.  If you think we can do that by going to war with every country in the world where there's injustice, then maybe we ought to invade ourselves first.  Let's not forget that mid-80's handshake between Don Rumsfeld and Saddam Hussein.  Let's not forget who armed the nascent Taliban against the Russians.  America has the highest per capita prison population in the world.  There is so much we need to repair at home. Instead we arrogantly presume to know what's best for world, and we fetch about killing brown people because they might one day act crazy.   I'm not part of the hate America crowd.  I don't think that there is such a crowd.  There are many who believe that, in order for America to regain and maintain an effective, long-term global alliance against terrorist entities, we must become a better nation.  We must become a nation that inspires hope rather than fear and trust rather than suspicion.     How many people do we have to kill in order to prove to people that killing people is wrong?

      Well, I try to keep up with important thing going on around the ol' world, but how can I when I turn on the brain sucker and see Britney Spears and Jako stories all day long instead of this...      urlLink April 25th (Washington, D.C.) An estimated 1,150,000 descended on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. today to give an urgent wake-up call to government leaders and the nation women's lives are at risk and lawmakers stop intruding on a woman's right to access critical reproductive health services and make deeply personal decisions about her health and life. And I didn't hear about it. There is something way wrong about that. I guess I need to look deeper.   How could I have missed this?  If over a million people get together for anything it should be BIG news.  Especially when civil rights are involved.  Our media sucks.

      I wander in to the local coffee house and park my uncaffeinated self down on a comfy couch with a cup of hot brew and pick up a copy of the local entertainment rag. Its a good read sometimes. The "letters to the editor" section is sometimes the best place to keep up with what's going on politically around town. And since we have a very interesting demographic around here it's usually interesting even if there's nothing to say. I enjoy that these people are upset enough about whatever thing it is to put pen to paper and spend money on the stamp. Ladies and gentleman, in this country we have a right to bitch. Don't take it for granted, its important. The woman in this piece was harassed by the DEA because of our good old "war on citize.....uh... I meant drugs". Her being printed in that paper is what she can do to defend herself. And as I repost it here...the American process is working in small part. You couldn't do this in China. God Bless America.   War on Drugs takes over the Friendly Skies   I am infuriated, but not surprised, at the lack of respect and sensitivity of our so-called law enforcement for its citizens.  Early in July, I was outside picking berries with my daughter when our airspace was invaded by what appeared to be a military (Black Hawk) helicopter. This incredibly loud and foreboding war machine flew so low that I was astounded, and threw my arms up in a gesture of "What are you doing? Can't you see there's a small child here? You're frightening us!"  The helicopter continued down the cove, then turned back repeatedly, until finally it flew in a continuous circle around and around our house. Often, it was so close I thought it would surely land in the yard.  I wanted to help. I called the Citizens Hotline, which connected me to Sen. John Edwards' office in Raleigh. Clueless, they directed me to his Charlotte branch, who, in turn, suggested that I call the local sheriff's department, which had me call the Civil Air Patrol. No answer there. Meanwhile, the aircraft circled above like a vulture over a trapped animal. So loud it was that, at times, we had difficulty hearing each other inside the house.  Exasperated, I took my daughter and drove away, halfway expecting to be pursued, like O.J. Indeed, in my mind, the only thing that might justify such severe surveillance is a murderer on the loose. I learned from neighbors that the flying continued in our cove for over two hours; that their homes and land were also targeted; and that many of them were forced to flee as well, or face insanity. Evidently, a small patch of marijuana was found on a neighbor's land up the mountain. I wonder, was this enough to traumatize this entire farm community? Is any amount enough to justify such flagrant disregard for our constitutional rights to peace and privacy? I continued making calls, hoping for answers or at least some accountability. I even called the FBI, who finally gave me the number of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.  I thought for a minute, "The DEA; the monster. Am I ready to take on the monster?" I think so. Because I am innocent and still free (though a lot less free than four years ago), I must stand up to the monster and say, "This is not OK! I will not be treated like a criminal when I am not one, and how dare you terrorize us in the sanctity of our home?" Do we as taxpayers employ our law enforcement to serve and protect us, or to intimidate and humiliate us?  I realize that taking on the DEA is like grabbing the tail of a viper. It is the ultimate manifestation of Big Brother. But fear feeds it, and apathy nurtures it. The "war on drugs" is nothing less than a war on you and me. We should recognize it as such and stand together in opposition and outrage. -Eva Scruggs, Leicester  How would you feel?

          John Kerry gave a great speech ( urlLink full text of John Kerry's speech ) last night that's put the Rovians on their heels for the moment.  They're advancing with plans to retake the offensive, however, beginning with  urlLink terrorist captures  and a  urlLink trip to Iraq by Colin Powell  to get the democratization back on the rails after a  urlLink national convention was postponed  because it's too freaking dangerous.  Allawi wanted it to go ahead despite the fact that most areas had yet to choose delegates, but the U.N. threatened to pull its backing of the process.  So, yeah, it's like that.  The Bushies will be pushing hard to spin GWB into the war-hero/peace-president/economic-braintrust/cuddly-teddybear.  Too bad that the world indicates that just the opposite is true on every count.  Here's some facts -   - The  urlLink economy grew at a much slower rate than expected  in the second quarter.

Really. - The Blue Lemur claims to have finally proven  urlLink Bush was AWOL . - There are now 94 'isolated incidents' of torture and murder in U.S. military prisons.   urlLink General J.C.

          George W. Bush, as the mainstream media tells us, is laying low as part of a presidential tradition of giving one's opponent some room to have a convention.  Fortunately, his advance men were on it months ago.  This Scrutiny Hooligan reported July 11th (and the New Republic on July 7th) that  urlLink the Bush Administration distributed a memo to Pakistani authorities telling them that July 27-29 would be the best time to announce any high-level Al Qaeda captures.     Boy Howdy  urlLink They Did It !  (Standard Disclaimer:  Terrorists=bad)  And just in time for Kerry's speech!  What Luck!  And, to think,  urlLink they're closing in on One-Eyed Mullah Omar  and the elusive diabetic himself, OBL.    The target captured by the Pakistanis is  urlLink Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani  Date of birth:  March 14, 1974; April 13, 1974; April 14, 1974; August 1, 1970 Place of birth:  Zanzibar, Tanzania Height:  5'3" - 5'4" Weight:  150 lbs Hair:  Black Eyes:  Brown Sex:  Male Nationality:  Tanzanian Aliases:  Ahmad Khalafan Ghilani, Ahmed Khalfan Ahmed, Abubakar K. Ahmed, Abubakary K. Ahmed, Abubakar Ahmed, Abu Bakr Ahmad, A. Ahmed, Ahmed Khalfan, Ahmed Khalfan Ali, Abubakar Khalfan Ahmed, Ahmed Ghailani, Ahmad Al Tanzani, Abu Khabar, Abu Bakr, Abubakary Khalfan Ahmed Ghailani, Mahafudh Abubakar Ahmed Abdallah Hussein, Shariff Omar Mohammed, "Foopie", "Fupi", "Ahmed the Tanzanian" Status:  Fugitive  The Bush administration has waited until the Democratic National Convention to announce this capture, and the Bush administration has waited until election season to close the net on Mullah Omar and  urlLink Osama Bin Laden .  The captures are politically motivated.  When Bush says, "We Got 'Im, Just Like I Told You We Would" know that he could have gotten him some time ago if it had truly been a priority.    A Living Osama Bin Laden gives Bush a bogeyman to frighten American parents with at night.  Watch Karl Rove over the next few days.  He's about to let GWB declare victory over Al Qaeda's management.

      JFK comes out a winner, strides onto the stage with the bearing of a man who's already won the election.  He lets people know he's the only candidate who will offer them Health Care, a Plan for Peace, a Plan for War, Social Security, an increase in the minimum wage, compassionate government, honesty, forthrightness, surety, energy independence, thoughtfulness, curiosity, big picture thinking.  In short, John Kerry will occupy all the empty space left by the rhetorically preoccupied Republican party and its President.  Democratic Content over Republican Style.

         Well, I’ve hit the one week mark on blogging.&nbsp; I was a blog virgin up to a week ago!&nbsp; So I wanted to take a moment to mark the event.&nbsp; Let’s take our eye off the convention for a moment and reflect.  Without a doubt, I’m sold.&nbsp; Blogging is awesome!!!&nbsp; And I think being part of a team really puts the cherry on top, to employ a metaphor from my first blog!!!&nbsp; So, yes a little retrospective is in order.  Last week, I was incensed at seeing Sandy Berger having absconded from the National Archives with documents.&nbsp; He and others say honest mistake, no harm no foul.&nbsp; Others say partisan witch hunt.&nbsp; Still others say it’s a serious problem.&nbsp; &nbsp; urlLink Well, in my first blog,  I let him have it.  Next, I  urlLink noticed a business story  that I felt was significant.&nbsp; It has little to do with politics, but scrutiny knows no bounds.&nbsp; You can expect more business stories from me.&nbsp; Unlike the usual business press that simply cheers companies who make money and eschews companies who don’t, I want to look beyond the Balance Sheet.&nbsp; Companies are&nbsp;just people afterall.  And another business story followed, this one with a political angle.&nbsp; I  urlLink took the broadcast networks to task  for their abandonment of their solemn obligation to the public.&nbsp; They have made this argument that conventions are news stories and if nothing particularly newsworthy happens, they don’t need to broadcast them.&nbsp; Because they need to broadcast reruns of Law & Order?  Then I noted Lance Armstrong’s  urlLink 6th Tour de France victory .&nbsp; I felt it an appropriate pre-convention human interest story.&nbsp; There’s a Franco-American relations angle for anyone willing to take it.  On Sunday night, I was watching convention coverage on television and someone mentioned that Al Jazeera would broadcast from the FleetCenter but that their sign had been taken down.&nbsp; I found a similar story on the internet.&nbsp; It didn’t sound right  urlLink so I posted something .&nbsp; The sign thing is probably a non story, there seems to be a legitimate explanation.&nbsp; But still, as someone pointed out in the comments, it should be noted that the Arab TV network will show more of the convention than America’s own broadcast networks.  Finally, I reacted to Ron Reagan’s speech at the convention.&nbsp; I wish I had given it more time and done more research on the topic. But instead,  urlLink I blogged what I knew at the time .&nbsp; I think that is okay as long as we publicize our ignorance but don't distort fact.&nbsp; I believe I made full disclosure on the ignorance part.  Some observations in closing:  1) A picture says a thousand words.&nbsp; Say whatever you want about my writing, but please consider that the pictures posted are an integral part of the overall message.&nbsp; I’ve chosen the images carefully. 2) I read the comments!&nbsp; I’ve posted a number of comments to other posts and I consider comments a big part of blogging.&nbsp; I thank everyone for their thoughtful additions, clarifications and opinions.&nbsp; Still, some of you posting as “Anonymous” need to step it up a notch. 3) I’m still learning from the masters, other Hooligans who have posted some phenomenal stuff.&nbsp; Partisan Hack, Screwy Hoolie, Uptown Ruler to name a few.&nbsp; I am humbled in their presence and honored by the invitation to contribute.  Well, that’s it.&nbsp; You can go back to convention coverage now.&nbsp; Have a great blog! &nbsp;I know I am.

          John Edwards has been off the campaign trail since Monday, nursing an unusual bout with a cold.  Tonight, one could hear his voice crack as he strained to keep his vocal cords from betraying his mortality.  Edwards speech was good... urlLink Read the full text here .  But, of course, if you saw Al Sharpton speak, then it's hard to swoon for Edwards.  You date the wild ones then marry the dependable ones, and Al made me want to have to have an affair.  Some excerpts:  "I suggest to you tonight that if George Bush had selected the court in '54, Clarence Thomas would have never got to law school."  "The promise of America is that government does not seek to regulate your behavior in the bedroom, but to guarantee your right to provide food in the kitchen."  " We cannot look at the Latino community and preach one language. No one gave them an English test before they sent them to Iraq to fight for America."  "We never got the 40 acres. We went all the way to Herbert Hoover, and we never got the 40 acres.  We didn't get the mule. So we decided we'd ride this donkey as far as it would take us."  "Mr. President, the reason we are fighting so hard, the reason we took Florida so seriously, is our right to vote wasn't gained because of our age. Our vote was soaked in the blood of martyrs, soaked in the blood of good men (inaudible) soaked in the blood of four little girls in Birmingham. This vote is sacred to us.  This vote can't be bargained away.  This vote can't be given away.  Mr. President, in all due respect, Mr. President, read my lips: Our vote is not for sale."   urlLink Read the Full Text of Rev.

          Michael Moore's  urlLink F9/11 showed in Crawford, Texas  tonight though the team-playing documentarian remained in Boston at the Democratic National Convention.     urlLink Zogby polling in six middle eastern nations  finds "an overwhelming majority of Arabs expressed an unfavourable view of the United States, ranging from 69% in Lebanon to 98% in Egypt".  This polling data underscores the abysmal failure of the Bush administration to be able to see beyond its own ideology.  Bush and the gang honestly believe that if they just keep repeating how good their intentions are, the Arab world will overlook their war of choice, killing of civilians, abandoning international alliances, betraying honest broker status between Israel and Palestine, and lying over and over again about what is going on in Iraq.  Speaking of polls:  In a much less reliable poll from the  urlLink online polls section of Al Jazeera  - 64% of respondents believe that the U.S. is building a case for war against Iran.  Meanwhile, in that last country we invaded, the shit is continuously  urlLink hitting the fan .  In addition to the 68 people killed in a massive car bombing today, "35 insurgents and seven Iraqi police were killed in clashes southeast of Baghdad, a U.S. soldier was killed in a bomb attack, and a police officer was assassinated."  And Dick Cheney steadfastly clings to  urlLink an antiquated fiction  of an Iraqi threat.  (Standard Disclaimer:  I hate having thoughts like this about our government, and, yes, Saddam is, was, and always will be a right bastard.)  In isolated reports, Saddam Hussein's lawyers and the International Red Cross say that  urlLink Saddam has had a stroke and may not live to be tried .  Could this untimely illness have anything to do with how Saddam planned to drag Rumsfeld, GHWBush, Reagan, GWBush, the FBI, the CIA, Thatcher. and others through the mud of history as he explained how he got away with his genocide and his proliferation?  I want an autopsy performed by Doctors Without Borders.  UPDATE :  U.S. military  urlLink denies stroke rumor , but does Rumsfeld's buddy Saddam have prostate problems?  Rumsfeld ought to probe this issue.  Who, incidentally, are  urlLink pulling out of Afghanistan  after five of their M.D.s were killed.  "Today's context is rendering independent humanitarian aid for the Afghan people all but impossible,"  In addition to Afghani warlords, Pakistani terrorists, and American politicians ballsing up the place, there's  urlLink Oodles and Oodles of fresh Opium , the most ever, being distributed from the greatest narco-state in history... Who's in charge there, again?  Karzai?  NATO?  The Great Shining Light of Democracy?  Whoever it is needs to quit flooding London with Heroin. ""Nato is not coming across with the resources it promised. It is a great concern to me that the poppy harvest has increased. They must find a way of persuading the farmers to switch back to wheat or cereal, but they earn five times as much by growing the poppy."   Meanwhile, back here in the United States, our electoral process is under fire from Jeb Bush and those kooky Floridians:  First, the electronic voting records from the 2002 gubernatorial race's touch-screen voting machines have been lost.   urlLink Gone.  Poof.  Bye.   Unverifiable.  So...the  urlLink ACLU would like to monitor  the next use of these machines, during the Florida primary elections this year before the presidential election.  Jeb Bush says No,  urlLink everything's hunky freaking dory , now STFU before I put an oil platform into your freaking gulf view.  Krugman's take  urlLink HERE .

      It seems that our inimitable St. Louis Federal Reserve has taken it upon itself to explore the relationship between religion and national incomes.&nbsp; After several rounds of not finding what they were hoping for, they now have released their latest results.&nbsp; It seems that they found a link between belief in hell and national income and corruption rankings.  What the authors want you to believe is that those countries with strong economies and low corruption are also the countries for&nbsp;which most of the population believes&nbsp;in hell.&nbsp; A fascinating conclusion, no doubt - if only it were true.  It turns out that they made a few blunders in their analysis but don't expect that to stop the press from repeating the Fed word for word.  The first mistake is failing to mention that from their own data one can calculate that the actual correlation between per capita income (PCI)&nbsp;and belief in hell (BIH); and it is negative.&nbsp; What this means is that, although the central claim of the report is that those countries with high BIH have high PCI, the reverse is more often the case.&nbsp; One must forgive the Fed for overlooking this particularly important statistic - what with it single handedly rendering their thesis mute.  The second error was to accidentally reverse the rankings of all the BIH data.&nbsp; Thus giving&nbsp;a rank of 1&nbsp;to that unscrupulous country, Latvia (only 8% of whom believe in hell), with the lowest BIH and giving the rank of 35 to that pinnacle of morality, Turkey (85%).&nbsp; When they report a negative correlation between BIH ranking and corruption ranking, they have accidentally reversed the true effect.&nbsp; So while they state that countries with a high BIH are less likely to be highly corrupt, their own data reveals the opposite.  But don't take my word for it, see their  urlLink article &nbsp;and be sure to check out their  urlLink data .  I don’t find this research to be a complete waste.&nbsp; After all, we should applaud the Fed for providing us a textbook example of dramatic irony.&nbsp; As you read the article, please bear in mind that the authors are exhibiting a form of corruption and weakening the economy by wasting tax payer dollars.&nbsp; As such and given the corrected analysis of their own data,&nbsp;can I&nbsp;be forgiven for assuming that the authors have a strong belief in hell?

         First, I’m amazingly impressed that the Democratic Party has put this complex scientific and ethical issue back on the table.&nbsp; Putting a huge spotlight on stem cell research in their quadrennial nominating convention is no small feat.&nbsp; They could have easily taken a pass. &nbsp;From purely a political angle, this could by itself galvanize the conservative evangelical crowd if they are not frothing at the mouth already.&nbsp; It could also add to the Democrat's futurist image which brings hope to young and old alike.&nbsp; It was a bold move politically, but more importantly, it was the right thing to do.&nbsp; We must have an open debate on this topic.   What is Stem Cell Research?&nbsp; Oh boy, I’m gonna botch this for sure, but I’ll give it a college try.&nbsp; The concept is actually pretty simple.&nbsp; An embryo starts as a single undifferentiated cell.&nbsp; Over time, this cell divides into two, two turns into four, four goes to eight, and nine months later you get a bouncing baby boy or girl with a bazillion cells.&nbsp; At some point in that process two cells which looked exactly the same under a microscope are sitting next to one another.&nbsp; One cell is destined to be the single ancestor to all the brain cells in the person.&nbsp; The other cell is destined become the single ancestor to all the liver cells.&nbsp; I don’t know all the details, but basically if you do a freeze frame at some point in the development of an embryo, you have the primordial cells to grow every organ in the human body.&nbsp; Fast forward into a post stem cell research revolution era and if you have a problem with one of your organs like your heart or liver, hell, throw it out, we’ll grow you a new one.   The implications are enormous for victims of many degenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s.&nbsp; Other uh,  inconveniences  like organ donor waiting lists practically disappear.&nbsp; Even victims of spinal cord injuries or other types of permanent paralysis could overcome it.&nbsp; Now, all that sounds awesome.&nbsp; I grew up on Star Trek – the original series, in its syndication days. I just can’t help but be awed by really cool science and technology.&nbsp; But having read enough science fiction novels and short stories, I recognize that it’s the thing you haven’t thought about that is the scariest.&nbsp; Just a couple of things that have been thought about that do I think rate the term scary.&nbsp; First, its hard to advance stem cell research without advancing human cloning research.&nbsp; Second, its hard to advance stem cell research without advancing research into aging, the kind of research that aims to have humans living two hundred years or more.   So, having gotten those fears off my chest, I just want to say loud and clear WE WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED.&nbsp; Every significant change that has happened in human civilization has had its critic predicting gloom and doom.&nbsp; And certainly, there are scenarios in the post stem cell research era that are not very attractive.&nbsp; But we’ve managed our way through technological change before.&nbsp; No, not perfectly, but we’re still kickin.&nbsp; The research is going to happen whether the U.S. government has anything to say about it or not.&nbsp; We would be probably be better &nbsp;thinking about how to manage our way through it than trying to hold on to the past.    urlLink Full Text of Ron Reagan’s Speech

          Senate hopeful and Progressive standard bearer Barack Obama embodied hope on the stage in Boston tonight.  He is an alchemical marvel of racial harmony, liberal justice, and raw energy.  From tonight's speech:  "Yet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there's not a liberal America and a conservative America — there's the United States of America. There's not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there's the United States of America. The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I've got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America."   urlLink Read the Full Text of Barack Obama's speech.

          Drudge has just published a transcript of a meeting between Michael Moore and Bill O'Reilly.  Evidently, the two ran across each other in Boston and had a left v. right tete-a-tete/shrillfest.  An excerpt:  M: Over 900 of our brave soldiers are dead.  What do you say to their parents?    O: What do I say to their parents?  I say what every patriotic American would say. We are proud of your sons and daughters.  They answered the call that their country gave them.  We respect them and we feel terrible that they were killed.  M: And, but what were they killed for?  O: They were removing a brutal dictator who himself killed hundreds of thousands of people  M: Um, but that was not the reason that was given to them to go to war, to remove a brutal dictator  O: Well we’re back to the weapons of mass destruction  M: But that was the reason  O: The weapons of mass destruction  M: That we were told we were under some sort of imminent threat  O: That’s right  M: And there was no threat, was there?  O: It was a mistake  M: Oh, just a mistake, and that’s what you tell all the parents with a deceased child, “We’re sorry.”  I don’t think that is good enough.  O: I don’t think its good enough either for those parents   M: So we agree on that   O: but that is the historical nature of what happened  M: Bill, if I made a mistake and I said something or did something as a result of my mistake but it resulted in the death of your child, how would you feel towards me?  O: It depends on whether the mistake was unintentional  M: No, not intentional, it was a mistake  O: Then if it was an unintentional mistake I cannot hold you morally responsible for that  M: Really, I’m driving down the road and I hit your child and your child is dead  Yes, that's right, kids.  When Bill O'Reilly says that the president made a mistake, you know that even the shrillest of the shrill sees the writing on the wall.  Read the entire transcript  urlLink HERE .

      Just got finished watching Clinton's speech and I still think he is one of the greatest orators of our day.&nbsp; here are my notes on the first night:     Al Gore has yet to come to terms with his "defeat."&nbsp; He has adopted a self deprecating humor about it which allows him to take on the role of "justified attack dog" even if he was on a short leash tonight.&nbsp; The smoldering anger behind his remarks only served to galvanise his message of "every vote counts" and "we need to unite as a party."&nbsp; He knows that these two things are what actually lost him the presidency.  Jimmy Carter is a great American.&nbsp; You could almost see him thinking that if we had followed his policy advice twenty six years ago, we would not be in Iraq today.&nbsp; His quote of the night for me: "we, as a nation, cannot hope to foster peace if we continue to maintain a state of panic."&nbsp; We need more people like him shouting from the roof tops these days.&nbsp; I thought he was very effective and affective in his criticism of our present administration without sounding like an attack dog.&nbsp; Good job by the DNC to give that job to Carter and not to Gore.&nbsp; It was also good to see the DNC giving Jimmy some props and respect as he was the most Democratic President of the second half of the twentieth century.  I do not remember the Sri Lankan woman's name who spoke on behalf of the victims of 9/11, but she was a sentimental favorite if not the best speaker.&nbsp; Her words of pain and compassion set a tone of reverence in a sea of hedonistic conventioning.&nbsp; She spoke of healing the wounds and looking forward to a day when the losses suffered on that day will not seem in vain.&nbsp; 'nuff said.  Senator Clinton is a force to be reckoned with.&nbsp; She spoke with authority and conviction, and demonstrated that a woman can play in the big leagues.&nbsp; She did not cover any new ground platform wise, and tended to reinforce to dominate message of the night which was party unity to defeat Bushco.&nbsp;   President Clinton and Senator Clinton don't seem to like each other very much.&nbsp; After her introducing him, they embraced on the stage like two people with shared political ambition.&nbsp; His endorsement of her as Senator and "the best public servant in [his] family" seemed somehow hollow.  Bill Clinton is one of our country's greatest ever speakers.&nbsp; Talk about whipping the faithful into a lather.&nbsp; He had me wanting to duck under the oval office desk.&nbsp; I think the DNC would do very well to have him on the front lines of any "getout the vote" campaigns.&nbsp; His presence ignited the crowd, and his words seemed to solidify those present.&nbsp; His passages about choosing to "form a better nation" almost had me cheering in my seat.&nbsp; His comparison of "their way" versus "our way" was direct and vivid without being divisive or hateful.&nbsp; Again, he stressed the importance of party unity in this election.   For the first night, everything went according to script, even the Gores' kiss at the end of Al's speech.&nbsp; I think the most startling aspect that everyone commented on, even Bob Dole, is that this is the most unity we have seen in the Democratic party in almost thirty years.&nbsp; The last time was at the end of Nixon/Ford when nobody could trust the president as far as they could throw him.&nbsp; Now it seems we are in a similar situation, and the party seems to be uniting again.&nbsp; Why can't we as Democrats ever unite on anything besides "we have throw this bastard out" instead of "we have the best candidate for the job?"

         Amongst the major news organizations reporting from the Democratic National Convention will be Al Jazeera.&nbsp; I’m sure you have heard of them, they are the 24 hour news network of the Arab world.&nbsp; One could characterize the network as being, well to put it mildly, controversial.&nbsp; This Hooligan will not add to the public debate on whether the network is biased or a mouthpiece for UBL.&nbsp; But, I do want to alert to everyone to the fact that they  urlLink will have a booth at the Democratic National Convention .   Huh! &nbsp;What?&nbsp; Hey, look, its fine.&nbsp; I don’t have a problem.&nbsp; I think controversy will stem not from the fact that they have equal real estate in the FleetCenter compared to other major media outlets, but from the fact that they don’t have equal treatment.&nbsp; They apparently can not display their logo.&nbsp; Not being there, I don’t know exactly what that means.&nbsp; But I reckon that the average convention goer will look up from the floor and see these big bright colorful signs for the friendlies: CNN, MSNBC, the BBC, etc.&nbsp; But cleansed from view will be that logo (as shown above).&nbsp; I wonder why.

      North Carolina's Eleventh Congressional District encompasses all of the mountainous counties in the western part of the state.  This is not Helms country.  It's not necessarily Bush country.  Buncombe County, home to the district's largest city, Asheville, went for Liddy Dole over  urlLink Erskine Bowles  in 2002 by only one vote.  Erskine's trying again to win a Senate seat, and he swung through the district Friday and Saturday to rally the faithful and prod the listless.   urlLink Patsy Keever , 12-year Buncombe County Commissioner, 25-year schoolteacher, and Vietnam Veteran Widow, accompanied candidate Bowles to rallies and fundraisers in Buncombe and Henderson Counties.  North Carolina primaries were held July 20th, and Patsy breezed past the progressive/radical Clyde Michael Morgan.  She garnered five times as many votes as the largely unknown Morgan in a low-turnout (12%) primary, and the campaign spent only about $15,000.  The Keever campaign has outraised multi-millionaire incumbent,  urlLink Charles Taylor  (more on him later), in each of the last three quarters.  The campaign has nearly a half-million dollars in the bank, and that's before, we're assured by local and national press, anyone is paying attention.  A half million dollars is a lot of money no matter where you are, but in the 11th district it's a king's ransom.    With over 500 registered, active volunteers, the campaign is making its presence felt across the district, with an especially large volunteer contingent in Taylor's home county, Transylvania.  An intern told this Hooligan that they anticipate an army of 1,000 volunteers by November.  With consistent phone banking, mailings, Letters to the Editor, and neighborhood canvassing efforts already underway, Keever has made the DNC stand up and take notice.    In hangover mode from the recent primary push, the campaign headquarters was quiet on Saturday.  A couple of interns shuffled about, cleaning and looking like they might not know what to do with themselves when not actively campaigning.  Patsy whisked in the door at 5pm, a bit wilted from the heat, but quick to join me on a small wicker sofa near the door.  "How are you doing?", Keever asked.  We talked a while about this hottest day of the year, and then about the time she spent with Senate candidate Bowles over the last 24 hours.  "He's just a regular person," She began, "saying some of the same things I've been saying, but in greater depth.  He has a depth of experience." Patsy looked to be sure that I was aware of Bowles history in the Clinton administration and then abruptly turned as a man walked in off the street.  "How are you?"  The man, Norris, a 30-year friend of Keever, informed her that he was organizing a music benefit for her campaign.  Keever was delighted, though unsurprised.  The groundswell of support has grown beyond the central control of campaign headquarters, and that's fine by campaign manager, Betsy Keever, who was taking the night off from her mother's campaign to celebrate her birthday.  Three high-school aged girls bounced into Keever headquarters, and Patsy tore herself away from Norris to greet them.  The girls were there to interview the candidate for some small publication, and Patsy gave them all the attention and respect that she afforded every other visitor, volunteer, friend, and campaign staffmember.    Aside from Keever's winning personality, fundraising prowess, and organizational wherewithal, she is standing on a strong democratic platform of Education, Health Care, Resource Management, Environmentalism, and Fiscal Responsibility.  Also, Keever is making a strong stand for veterans who have been negatively affected by the policies of the Bush administration supported by Charles Taylor.  Through the primaries, Keever had little problem focusing on those issues she holds dearest, though she anticipates Taylor will bring several wedge issues into the race.  Charles Taylor, largest landowner in WNC, Appropriations Chair of the Interior Committee, member of House subcommittees including: Commerce, Justice, States, and the Judiciary, has served for 14-years and has a well-earned reputation as a vicious campaigner.  His traditional tactics are likely to backfire on him with Keever, however.  Any attempt to paint the approachable, ethical Keever as crooked, dangerous, or un-american will simply make Taylor look like the bully that he is.  Taylor is currently under investigation by the House ethics committee for activities in his bank, Blue Ridge Savings and Loan, and he has presided over the longest sustained loss of manufacturing jobs in Western North Carolina history.    Keever's campaign is all about Keever.  Though Patsy's supporters are quick to call Taylor a criminal, unethical, clear-cutting, pork-barrel, Tom Delay Apostle, Keever herself never mentions Taylor's name.  This is a real pick-up opportunity for the Democrats in this November's elections.  Visit the  urlLink campaign website , donate time or  urlLink money , wear a button or t-shirt.  Patsy Keever is beholden to no corporate interests, and her values are what you'd expect of a good southern democrat.

         Well it's almost upon us, the Democratic National Convention.  Today's conventioneering is an unholy fusion of shmooze fest, keg party, circle jerk, echo chamber, high theater, and kingmaking.  So it will come as no surprise that your own scrutiny hooligans will cover the DNC, warts, smirks, and all.  As is the case whenever dems look like they may dominate the news cycle, a  urlLink Terrorist Threat  has been identified. "The FBI said Friday that it had "unconfirmed information" that a domestic group plans to attack media vehicles, possibly with "explosives or incendiary devices,"".  Not Al Q., but a 'domestic' organization... hmmm... where's Tom Delay?  Why is the Convention important if it's just a bunch of backslappers running around trying to get invited to each others' parties?  Because A Whole Heap of Undecideds will be tuning in to find out if JFK is their guy.   urlLink MyDD shows us  polling numbers indicating that Kerry's post-convention bounce could be large and permanent.  Those members of the newly curious convention watching demographic will have to get their information from cable and other news sources because, as Writ of Summons explains below, the big three networks  urlLink  don't give a damn.    The fine folks at  urlLink Independents for Kerry have posted a partial list   of speakers.  Here's the rundown of the heavy hitters: MONDAY - President Al Gore, President Jimmy Carter, President Bill Clinton TUESDAY - Barack Obama, Howard Dean (both conspicuously absent from press releases), and Teresa Kerry WEDNESDAY - John and Elizabeth Edwards THURSDAY - Cleland introduces Kerry  Here's a line from Kerry's speech last night, "Step back from the politics,"  urlLink Kerry said . "Step back from the labels. Forget about Democrat, Republican, Independent. Forget about it. Think about your lives ... Everything is on the line in this race."  Any disagreement from the 'splinter the vote' crowd?  Follow the blogging of the convention at  urlLink www.conventionbloggers.com .  To our netizen compatriots, Scrutiny Hooligans send snarky salutes and genuine hopes that you'll each get a thrilling scoop.

         Times are tough at the big three networks.&nbsp; Viewership continues to erode going to cable and other forms of media.&nbsp; And we must have a heart.&nbsp; Disney, owner of ABC has seen their stock go up by a mere 32% over the last 24 months.&nbsp; GE, owner of NBC and one of the biggest corporations in the world, has gone up a meager 6% over the same period.&nbsp; Poor Viacom, owner of CBS, has seen their stock go down by 10% in the last two years but they did manage to post a $724 million dollar profit in the last quarter.&nbsp; So urlLink  the programming department decided  its time to offer the public something more sexy than …yawn… political conventions.&nbsp; NBC in its desire to satisfy the public with “reality” programming will offer Fear Factor, For Love or Money and one hour of the convention on Monday.&nbsp; NO convention coverage on Tuesday.&nbsp; The Next Action Star, a Law & Order repeat, and one hour of convention on Wednesday.&nbsp; And on the big night, one, count it one hour of coverage buttressed by repeats of Scrubs, Will and Grace, and Last Comic Standing.&nbsp; Not to be outdone, the other two networks have the exact same intentions – a&nbsp;BIG 3  urlLink &nbsp;hours of coverage, total .&nbsp; I won’t bore you with the litany of repeats and dismal “reality” shows the other two offer instead.&nbsp; In the interest of fairness, the Republican convention will get equal short shrift.&nbsp; Thankfully, the Public Broadcasting System, a.k.a. PBS understands what its duty to the public is.&nbsp; They will have 3 hours of prime time coverage  EACH NIGHT .&nbsp; The networks say that no news will be generated at these events and thus they are unworthy of so much attention.&nbsp; But the fact is that these three mega-corporations won’t sell as much advertising time nor at as high a rate by showing more of the conventions.&nbsp; And who buys this air time?&nbsp; Mostly other mega-corporations.&nbsp; They pretty much don’t want the public really engaging in a debate about healthcare, the environment, defense policy or free trade.&nbsp; Times are tough and the last thing we need is to pinch the bottom line.&nbsp; You deserve a break today at McDonalds.

      The greatest affront to the operation of any democracy is the silencing of the multiplicity of dissenting voices in a society.  Partisan Democrats, factually in error and intellectually misguided, labeled Nader and the Greens who supported him as "spoilers" and claim, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that third party supporters delivered the election to BushCo.  Though nothing could be further from the truth, the rumor persists and must be reckoned with.  Its persistence reveals a deep, deep contradiction in American political philosophy with oxymoronic implications.  Americans, especially around election time, simultaneously demand and repudiate  change .  Perhaps, this is why there is only a hairs-breadth of a difference between the candidates of the two Mega-Parties.  In a 50/50 nation, this phenomenon is both understandable and frustrating.  Beneath it all lies a growing tide of dissent momentarily in check because most individuals who drift left of center are united in their opposition to the failed and disastrous foreign policy objectives of the Bush Administration.  Oddly enough, there is little wrangling over Bush's domestic agenda.  Kerry, Edwards, Bush and Cheney affirm tax cuts, support legislation that blame teachers for problems in school, propose developing alternative energy sources and ending dependence on foreign oil, believe huge bureaucracies will protect citizens from elusive, amorphous terrorist threats, court minorities with vacuous promises of inclusion, and oppose gay marriage.  If Kerry has any chance at all this November, it has very little to do with any innovation or novel ideas, and everything to do with the growing credibility gap in the Bush Administration.  However, victory shouldn't rest on such tenuous foundations.  Should Iraq grow wings, should the up-surge in the economy gather speed over the coming months, should more high-level Kerry advisors make potentially criminal blunders, should the recent confusing and meaningless 9/11 Commission sound-bite ("We are safer . . .") placate a Nation of fence-sitters, Americans resistant to change will buy the "mid-stream and horses" argument and the Democrats' anger will grow for four more years.  A perfect illustration of the blame-embrace-blame game of our American Duopoly may be the appearance of websites similar to this  urlLink  one  .  Subtitled "Defeat Bush, Vote Kerry in Swing States," the official website for  Greens for Kerry     offers the following justification for momentarily abandoning its allegiance to third party idealism in a time of dire straits for a nation riddled with conflict and contradiction:   As Greens, we strongly disagreed with John Kerry's vote in support of the Iraq War Resolution. We believe the Senator's vote represents, by the very least, an error in judgment. Even if Kerry's primary defense is true, that he believed that voting for the Resolution strengthened the President's negotiating hand with Iraq and that it called for (and he was promised by the administration) the exhaustion of all peaceful alternative solutions (including UN approval) before an attack, Senator Kerry should have known better than to entrust Bush/Cheney with the power and responsibility to have final say on whether to wage war on another nation. Or, maybe the Senator voted for the Resolution because he felt that if he didn't he would be attacked for being soft on terrorism, too liberal, and un-patriotic, thereby hurting his chances of winning the Democratic nomination and the Presidency. Or, perhaps it was a combination of the two. No matter, in light of the neo-cons that control the White House (Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Cheney), their history of deception and war mongering, their ties to the oil industry, and their lust for empire, there is no satisfying justification for Senator Kerry's vote.   While acknowledging the implications of Kerry's vote and how antithetic it is to the principles of the Green Party, the differences between the Senator and the President, even on an issue such as Iraq, are significant. The fact is if John Kerry had been President the war on Iraq would never have taken place. Further, Kerry was an outspoken critic of the Bush administration's march to war, consistently bringing attention to their missteps and mis-representations. He also supported working with the international community, specifically the United Nations, before considering an invasion (which he opposed once Bush initiated). None of this changes Kerry's vote and its consequences. Nor does it change the fact that the Senator has too often demonstrated a willingness to use force as a means to further US policy and that he supports America's continued occupation of Iraq.   The Senator's vote demonstrated either an error in judgment, politically motivated maneuvering, or a combination of the two. However, the Bush administration's use of deception to con an entire country into supporting an unjust war is a crime against humanity. Consider the record: they used fear as a tool of control, showed disdain for the international community and its laws, demonstrated no interest in the well being and safety of the Iraqi people once the war was over, privatized large parts of the military and encouraged the use of torture (70-90 percent of whom have now been found to be innocent), mistreated the men and women of the armed forces that are sacrificing their lives in the deserts of a foreign land, and the list goes on and on.   The Bush administration represents a detour from the fundamental tenets of democracy and human decency. This White House poses a clear and present danger to our Country and World. Kerry's vote to approve the Iraq Resolution, while extremely disappointing (as he voted against the first Gulf War), pales in comparison to the actions of an administration that is carrying out stage one of a "new world order". As Greens, we will demand more from a Kerry administration than he exhibited on this vote, and if public protest and a grassroots movement is necessary to remind him of those same principles he advocated so eloquently for as a leader of the peace movement in 1971, then we stand ready to mobilize.       urlLink  The Green Party  , as a voice of dissent, is sharply critical of the Democratic Party Platform for 2004, not because the Greens are radical socialists, but because in an effort to win at all costs, the Democrats have written a platform that appears to be a watered down version of BushCo's agenda for a second administration.  Among the notable criticisms are the following:   Sen. Kerry has no clear position on strengthening the Kyoto Accord, restoring U.S. participation in the agreement, or aggressive national and international steps to stem catastrophic global climate change, or challenging the domination of U.S. policy by energy firms like Halliburton. The Democratic Party's 2004 platform does not mention the Kyoto Accord or higher fuel efficiency standards for cars.   Neither Sen. Kerry nor the Democratic Platform call for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq; Sen. Kerry proposes to send 40,000 additional troops to Iraq for a prolonged occupation, despite Iraq's new 'sovereignty.' Neither Sen. Kerry nor the Democratic Platform criticizes former Iraqi administrator Bremer's mandate opening up Iraqi resources and business to up to 100% foreign ownership, which violates the 1907 Hague Conventions' rules against pillage by an invading nation.   Sen. Kerry, reversing his position, has announced his support for Israel's security fence in the West Bank, which was ruled illegal by the International Court of Justice (http://www.johnkerry.com/press..). During its 2004 national convention in Milwaukee last month, the Green Party of the United States adopted an expanded platform statement on the conflict, calling for restoration of rights for Palestinians and recommending the democratic one-state solution. The plank also calls the separation barrier "an obstacle to peace and a unilateral escalation of conflict." Greens, unlike Bush and Kerry, support the right of return for Palestinians and withdrawal from the occupied territories, and have called for the suspension of aid until Israel complies with international law.   The Democratic Platform says nothing about overturning or revising the USA Patriot Act or about the Ashcroft Justice Department's possible plans to expand the act. 332 cities, four states, and the Green Party have condemned the act's numerous violations of the U.S. Constitution (http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/...).   The Democratic Platform makes no mention of veterans, despite the Bush Administration's efforts in 2003 to scale back veterans' benefits by $25 billion.    Despite the efforts of pundits and partisan bloggers to label third parties as spoilers and their candidates as ego-maniacs (I can't think of any two bigger ego-maniacs then George "I wanna be da peace preznit" Bush and John F "As in more F-ing Botox" Kerry), third parties are the gad-flys of American political homogeneity, the chocolate to our national obsession with vanilla.  After all, the Mega-Parties won't reform themselves, but will continue to mirror each other more and more until we have no choice at all.  The following is a list of voices competing for your ears while the drone of conformity seeks to drown them out.   urlLink  The Libertarian Party   has this to say:   The twin tenets of peace and free trade are mutually dependent. As French visionary Frederic Bastiat once said, "If goods don't cross borders, soldiers will." When countries rely upon each other in peaceful commerce, the people of those countries have every incentive to avoid violent conflict.   More and more Americans are coming to oppose the war, the war hawks and high government officials are beginning to distance themselves from the president, and the U.S. seems more willing than ever to pull out of Iraq.  "Marriage partners, not government, should define the terms and spiritual orientation of their union in accordance with our nation's guarantee of religious freedom."   In the 2000 campaign for president, George W. Bush said that the federal government should not interfere with the medical marijuana policies of the several states. Like so many other promises, he went back on his word and has closed down medical marijuana facilities permitted by state governments.    Read  urlLink  The Militant   for news of the Socialist Party and its efforts to tip the balance in favor of the have-nots for a change.   urlLink  The Social Equality Party   speaks out about the Democrats' ties to corporate interests:   The all-but-certain nomination of John Kerry as the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party demonstrates once again the complete subservience of the existing two-party system to the interests of the corporate-financial oligarchy that rules the United States.   There is even a  urlLink  Prohibition Party   calling for slavish adherence to the word of God.  As a stark alternative, hedonists, porn stars and gamblers comprise the  urlLink  Personal Choice Party  , complete with Marilyn Chambers as VP.  Think Bush should be in jail?  Well, you can vote for a candidate who is in jail.  Join Leonard Peltier and the  urlLink  the Peace & Freedom Party  .  (Actually, former AIM founder and Native activist Peltier should be free!)  Read about the party GWB would join if his daddy wasn't a former Republican president,  urlLink  the Constitution Party  , the Party of Small Government and Big Bibles.  Right wing fascists and ultra conservative nut-jobs might find a new home in the  urlLink  American Party  .

         Microsoft.  The company of heroic innovation and total hubris.  But I guess they have peaked because they are  urlLink set to pay out $75 billion dollars to their shareholders  via dividends and stock buy back.  Yes, that’s billion with a bee!!  Giving $75 billion dollars to your shareholders means that you had great big dreams, but alas you woke up finally.  They are saying that the shareholders can make better use of the capital than the management can.  Software makers practically print money with every diskette they make and here they are saying that moms, dads, grandmas, granddads, twenty-something folks just starting their 401k or mutual fund investing can do more with the money than they can.  They only accumulated this war chest because they thought they could use it.  What were their alternatives?  Maybe start up 3,750 companies each with $20 million in seed funding.  No, not the next generation of dot coms but companies that will solve 21st century problems like renewable energy, waste clean up, natural resource preservation, and the like.  Or provide 3,750 charities, or other non-profit philanthropic enterprises with $20 million endowments.  Hey wait a minute, maybe they could have found the highest and best use for the capital…

      We Americans can feel proud again today.&nbsp; We are the owners of 39 new Blackhawk helicopters, a new nuclear attack submarine, and we cut funding for NASA, the environment, and basic research.&nbsp; To what pray tell can we attribute these astounding goings on?&nbsp; Our congress, in its infinite wisdom, has just approved a $417 billion defense budget.   Included in the budget, is $25 billion for the next year's efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq.&nbsp; No mention of the fact that both operations are flat busted and need $12.5 billion just to get to the end of this fiscal, not calendar, year (the Pentagon closes its books in September.)&nbsp; "The administration has fallen down on the job in budgeting for these wars, and its budget projections simply are not to be trusted," said Sen.

Here are the stories that are likely to end up on the cutting room floor of the mainstreamers tonight:  "An attempt to amend the North Carolina Constitution to prohibit marriage between same-sex couples — as well as civil unions and domestic partnerships — failed when the Legislature adjourned July 18,"  urlLink reports hrc.org .  Further, the article informs us that, "Twenty-five states introduced legislation this year that sought to amend the state constitution to prohibit the performance and/or recognition of marriages between same-sex couples and in some cases more (civil unions, domestic partnerships, etc.)."  Click the link to find out if your state is on the list.  Remember Howard Dean?  Remember when he was odds-on favorite to win the nomination?  Remember the story about nuclear material gone missing from a Vermont storage site?  It never went missing at all, it's  urlLink right where Howard left it .  Thanks to ... urlLink And Then  for the link.  Protestors at the RNC and DNC won't be allowed to protest anywhere near the objects of their protests.   urlLink Free Speech Zones  have been created behind fences.  This is for the peoples' protection.  Irony.  Too.  Much.  To.  Bear.  The Poorman  urlLink imagines a poker game  between Dick Cheney and The Poorman Editors.  The right wing spin machine gets involved, "Liberal critics of Mr. Cheney's poker hand contend that "he doesn't have anything". Oh, really, liberal critics? Cheney has already showed them the six of clubs, and yet these liberals persist in saying he has "nothing". Why do liberals consider the six of clubs to be "nothing"? Is it because the six of clubs is black?"  Thanks to  urlLink Wonkette  for the link.

         Dr. John Wicks, aged 68, a psychiatrist from Decatur, Alabama, is  urlLink heading to Iraq  after being asked by the Army if he felt fit to serve.  ""I stuck the thing in my pocket and carried it around for several weeks agonizing on how I should respond," he told The Decatur Daily in a story Sunday. "The truth is I consider myself fit to serve, so that's how I marked it and sent it back."  Wicks continues, "My wife said 'You'll never hear from them.' Well, it was no time at all till I heard from them," Wicks said."  The Decatur Daily writes, "He'll need good morale and hopes it will be contagious in Iraq where he will check on combat stress.  Dr. Wicks, who works at North Alabama Regional Hospital and lives near Athens, is one of many men and women the army has called out of retirement this past year to fill the shortage of skilled personnel, such as mental health experts."     urlLink Is America's military spread too thin ?

      The Mobile Register reports that thousands of African American farmers across the country are being bilked out of their fair share of the proceeds from a landmark 1999 settlement in a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture alleging that federal farm officials have a track record of discriminating against black farmers by denying them loans and other forms of  urlLink  aid  .  According to a story appearing in the New Orleans Times-Picayune,  urlLink  Federal auditors, poring over the Defense Department's conflicting financial statements, missing data and accounting discrepancies, say they cannot provide an accurate check of the Pentagon's books, even as Congress prepares to deliver $418 billion to help run the Pentagon next year.   Riddle me this:   -- Pay for National Guard soldiers deployed to fight in Iraq was so mismanaged that many soldiers and their families went unpaid. In one unit alone, 25 veteran special forces soldiers quit in angry frustration at the end of their tours, the GAO said.  -- A Pentagon agency mistakenly sold to GAO agents equipment that could be used for making biological weapons.  -- Another Pentagon agency mistakenly sold chemical warfare suits on the Internet for $3 each while a separate office was struggling to fill shortages with new suits it bought for $200 each.  -- Military hospitals have failed to collect tens of millions of dollars from insurance companies on behalf of their patients.  -- Because of inaccurate records, ship repairs ordered by the Navy couldn't be completed for lack of parts.    Writers at the Chicago Sun Times note that protestants are rapidly becoming a  urlLink  minority  .  And we thought there were problems with the disenfranchised angry white man . . .  Turns out BushCo underestimated the cost of the Iraq Invasion by  urlLink  over 12 billion dollars  .  Oops, my bad.  On a lighter note, the DNC whines about the  urlLink  questionable timing   of the leak regarding former Clinton security advisor Berger's "honest mistake."

      Bye, Bye, Berger. Despite the refusal of some partisan bloggers to take this story seriously, Berger's so-called "honest mistake" tops the list of shady, dubious, and inexcusable blunders, second only to the "inadvertent" (yeah right) loss of W's National Guard records. In a world of half-truths and agenda-driven media outlets, what is good for the goose is good for the gander.   Eloquent, intelligent, right-wing-wingnut, William Saffire offers a confusingly poignant glimpse inside the  urlLink  Republican brain  .   Though there seem to be few differences between the candidates of the Mega-Parties of our American Duopoly regarding the war, BushCo's choice of  urlLink judicial nominees   may be one more good (and honest)reason to change executives this November. Consider this:    The Myers nomination was the starkest example yet during the Bush administration of the debate over whether someone who has spent a career vigorously advocating a particular ideological viewpoint is an appropriate candidate to be a federal judge.     The Christian Science Monitor reports mixed results of the 1996 bipartisan effort to  urlLink  reform welfare  . You remember, that Clinton-era initiative that made Democrats feel like Republicans again.   Mo' money, mo' money. The Baltimore Sun reports:  urlLink "And if I am a big-time donor to Bush or Kerry, I am most likely working in an industry where my agenda conflicts with the public's interest," said Celia Wexler, vice president for advocacy at the nonpartisan watchdog group Common Cause.    Meanwhile, the death toll rises in the aftermath of a war that both Parties overwhelmingly approved.  urlLink  901, to be exact  .  SAY WHAT !?! John "Bush Lite" Kerry  urlLink supports and endorses  the Bush Doctrine of pre-emptive strike and backpedals on a promise made way-back-when in the primary to advocate for multi-national cooperation in times of global conflict. Oh,yeah, and Edwards wants a "domestic intelligence agency," too. I, for one, think  urlLink citizens spying on citizens  is a great way to promote our democratic values. Thanks for thinking outside the box, Mr. Edwards.(Didn't we learn our lesson with Ridge and&nbsp;the Department of Homeland Security?Wait, wasn't that a Democrat's idea in the first place?)   Reason 1001 why the Democrats should develop some semblance of a winning strategy, Greenspan, love child of the Clinton-Republican trist that was the early 1990's, announces that the Bush Tax Cut Plan (almost entirely endorsed by Kerry and Edwards) saved the economy from  urlLink  severe recession  .   Robin Cook offers an explanation why the 70-some-odd Senators, including Kerry and Edwards, were terribly, terribly stupid to give BushCo a blank check to spank Sadaam (hint: it was just what  urlLink bin Laden wanted  ).

      From the Good People at  urlLink TvNewsLies.Org !   Joe gets up at 6:00am to prepare his morning coffee. He fills his pot full of good clean drinking water because some liberal fought for minimum water quality standards. He takes his daily medication with his first swallow of coffee. His medications are safe to take because some liberal fought to insure their safety and work as advertised.   All but $10.00 of his medications are paid for by his employers medical plan because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance, now Joe gets it too. He prepares his morning breakfast, bacon and eggs this day. Joe’s bacon is safe to eat because some liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry.   Joe takes his morning shower reaching for his shampoo; His bottle is properly labeled with every ingredient and the amount of its contents because some liberal fought for his right to know what he was putting on his body and how much it contained. Joe dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air he breathes is clean because some tree hugging liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air. He walks to the subway station for his government subsidized ride to work; it saves him considerable money in parking and transportation fees. You see, some liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor.  &nbsp; Joe begins his work day; he has a good job with excellent pay, medicals benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. Joe’s employer pays these standards because Joe’s employer doesn’t want his employees to call the union. If Joe is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed he’ll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some liberal didn’t think he should loose his home because of his temporary misfortune.   Its noon time, Joe needs to make a Bank Deposit so he can pay some bills. Joe’s deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some liberal wanted to protect Joe’s money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the depression.   Joe has to pay his Fannie Mae underwritten Mortgage and his below market federal student loan because some stupid liberal decided that Joe and the government would be better off if he was educated and earned more money over his life-time.   Joe is home from work, he plans to visit his father this evening at his farm home in the country. He gets in his car for the drive to dads; his car is among the safest in the world because some liberal fought for car safety standards. He arrives at his boyhood home. He was the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers Home Administration because bankers didn’t want to make rural loans. The house didn’t have electric until some big government liberal stuck his nose where it didn’t belong and demanded rural electrification. (Those rural Republican’s would still be sitting in the dark)   He is happy to see his dad who is now retired. His dad lives on Social Security and his union pension because some liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Joe wouldn’t have to. After his visit with dad he gets back in his car for the ride home.He turns on a radio talk show, the host’s keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good. (He doesn’t tell Joe that his beloved Republicans have fought against every protection and benefit Joe enjoys throughout his day).

         In culling stories that might interest Scrutiny Hooligans, I invariably end up with two or three gems that just don't make it into the roundups.  Today's roundup celebrates ignoring the Sandy Berger Story, recognizing a few stories that slipped by unnoticed, and touting some silliness.  OUTFOXED makes its move into the  urlLink U.S. courts , challenging Fox News' use of 'Fair and Balanced'.  U.S.  urlLink refuses to convert military aid  into economic aid for the friendly folks in Egypt.  Israel doesn't like it, but what are they gonna do?  The U.S. arms market must stay strong or else the terrorists have won...  Just like we must stay the course in the free and sovereign nation of Iraq (where, incidentally,  urlLink the interim governor of Basra was assassinated , as was a Defense Ministry official...and a truck bomb killed 9 and wounded over 60 today) or else the terrorists will have won...  The  urlLink L.A. Times provides a portrait  of confused youth outside the Green Zone: ""I'm confused about how I should feel about killing," says Dubois, who has a toddler back home. "The first time I shot someone, it was the most exhilarating thing I'd ever felt."  Dubois turns back to the road. "We talk about killing all the time," he says. "I never used to talk this way. I'm not proud of it, but it's like I can't stop. I'm worried what I will be like when I get home."  The men aren't Special Forces soldiers. They're just ordinary troops with the Army's 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment serving their 14th month in Iraq, much of it in daily battles. In 20 minutes, they will come under attack."  Also, in order to keep the terrorists from winning, we'll need to institute the most far-reaching, intrusive, state control over information imaginable - Project MATRIX.  The ACLU - as noted by Tha Ruler - is on the case.  Watch the short video  urlLink HERE .  Send a free fax to your representative  urlLink HERE .  We have to keep the terrorists from winning because George W. Bush wants to protect freedom from evildoers.  Watch the President enjoy My Pet Goat with a classroom of youngsters as the Twin Towers burn.  This is the  urlLink real time video  - Thanks to  urlLink Anonymoses  - Five Minutes Long.  At  urlLink Bunch of Pants : Mark reads the Declaration of Independence aloud and looks for the part about the black people.  Lastly,  urlLink Wonkette  responds to bloggers' fashion queries about  urlLink what to wear  to the Democratic National Convention, "Great questions, but you're clearly approaching the question of convention wardrobe using the wrong rubric. It's not really "suits or casual," it's, "Does it does show stains?" or "Can you wash it in the sink of the ladies' room?" Bonus question: "How easily does it come off?" (Not kidding: The convention is like a high school Model U.N.; few of those attending could get laid in the real world, but once among their own wonky kind, well, let the rutting begin!)  As for us, we were going to go with the clown suit, but Mr. Wonkette has mentioned something about a chastity belt..."

          First off, the French must have started watching Fox News and listening to Franklin Graham because some set of neo-nazi wingnuts have gone and defaced an entire cemetary's worth of Muslims' headstones.  Instances of anti-Muslim and anti-Jewish violence, intimidation, and bigotry are evidently tres vogue among the French Goebbels-philes.  See the  urlLink pics here .  So, of course, when Ariel Sharon got wind of all this trouble in France, he: A) sent a delegation to help the French government counter the neo-nazis B) urged muslims and jews to unite against a common enemy C) told all 600,000 French Jews to run like hell to Israel  The answer is  urlLink here .  (Hint:  Jacques Chirac told reporters that Ariel Sharon is no longer welcome on French soil after the Israeli Prime Minister made his public statements.  The stance was softened in administration reframes of Chirac's words.)

      Well boys and girls,&nbsp; we at Scrutiny Hooligans were invited to view to opening of "Outfoxed," an underground expose on the political bent of Fox News.&nbsp; Not being a fan of Rupert and Co. in&nbsp; the first place, I was ready to be informed and exasperated by the show.&nbsp; Little did I know... Here's a quick sketch:    Rupert Murdoch's corporate media holdings have the potential to reach a staggering 3 billion people a day.&nbsp; This includes over 24 million American households in print and television.&nbsp; The significance of this cannot be overestimated when you consider the dwindling number of news outlets available to the American consumer.  Each day a "daily memo" is circulated in the Fox News offices directing the agenda for the day.&nbsp; These range from changing the word "sniper" to "sharpshooter" in relation to US troops with high powered rifles and scopes stationed in concealed locations shooting anonymously at distant humans.&nbsp; To the more sinister directives to focus on single issues such as abortion rights and gay marriage that might serve to divide and frighten their viewing base to the detriment of other newsworthy topics.&nbsp; These directives are sent from on high and are not to be ignored.&nbsp; Basically,&nbsp; the journalists at Fox are told each day what will be newsworthy and appropriate for broadcast.&nbsp; Did someone say propaganda?  The ratio of guests on Fox news are overwhelmingly neo-conservative republicans.&nbsp; The numbers do not lie:&nbsp; in a period of eight months, the right winged guests outnumbered the left winged variety by 83 to 17.&nbsp; Balanced?  Fox News' linguistic trickery from top to bottom.&nbsp; In one segment, the phrase "some people say" was used by Fox to bully and disrupt live guests and to thinly disguise opinion as documented fact.&nbsp; The phrase in question was once used to protect legitimately gathered anonymous sources;&nbsp; however, in the culture of Fox,&nbsp; it is splashed about as a way of interjecting opinion into journalism and drawing attention away from legitimate talking points.&nbsp; There is a montage of clips from various Fox broadcasts where every recognizable figure on Fox is quoted with said phrase repeatedly.  Fox also encourages its reporters to engage in verbal banter that insults or degrades the Democratic Party.&nbsp; In an almost 7th grade locker room style,&nbsp; the anchors are congratulated and praised for unscripted remarks aimed at liberals while facing censure and possible termination for banter about conservatives.  Then comes Bill O' Rielly.&nbsp; Not only does he routinely tell his guests to "shut up" when they stray into waters of Liberal Viability, he will flat out lie to assasinate their character.&nbsp; Take the example of Mr Glick.&nbsp; Glick is the son of a 9/11 victim who signed an affidavit condemning the US led actions in Afghanistan and Iraq, citing his belief that bombing and killing more innocent people would do little to bring resolution to our current dilemma.&nbsp; He then pointed out to Bill that binLanden had been trained by the CIA while Poppa Bush was director of that agency.&nbsp; He was drawing attention to the irony of Dubya's actions and the role played by the US in enabling bin Laden et al.&nbsp; Billy boy however took offence to Mr. Glick and accused him of defiling the memory of his father.&nbsp; By the end of the show he was accusing Glick of saying that the two Bush's were directly responsible for the attacks on 9/11.&nbsp; He did not give up there,&nbsp; for at least six months Bill Oreilly drug Mr. Glick's name and reputation through the mud by proclaiming that Glick had accused Dubya of a direct hand in the terrorist attacks in NYC.   This is just the surface bit of the Fox news iceberg.&nbsp; When Walter Cronkite appears and spells out his belief that Fox News is "an unofficial arm of the Republican Party," &nbsp;you begin to understand that in the journalism business Fox has no respect and are viewed as entertainment and not news.&nbsp; Yet they market themselves&nbsp;as Fair&nbsp;&amp; Balanced.&nbsp;   For more info on the movie go to:   urlLink www.outfoxed.org   To order a copy on DVD and for info on arranging an "Outfoxed" house party visit:&nbsp;  urlLink action.moveon.org/outfoxed/

      Scrutiny Hooligans, remember the Axis of Evil? Let's see it was North Korea, Iraq, and.....Iran!&nbsp; Well, it seems the Bush Administration has decided to turn its attention to "looking into" whether Iran has any  urlLink LINK  to Al-Queida and 9/11.  Israel is ready to  urlLink ASSIST  this time, which will be helpful since Bush has made it  urlLink CLEAR  he wants a regime change in Iran, though the acting CIA head, John McLaughlin, has gone on record, saying there is no credible  urlLink EVIDENCE  that Iran had anything to do with 9/11. Of course, evidence hasn't been high on this administrations list of reasons to go to war; guess we'll have to wait and see. It wouldn't shock this Hooligan if the charges against Iran didn't grow, heading into November 4th...  And so as not to depress the living @#$% out of you. A toast to our friends at the ACLU for this little  urlLink GEM !

      Russia is in negotiations to send as many as  urlLink 40,000 troops to Iraq  beginning sometime this fall..."Formations considered for the Russian deployment include three mechanized infantry divisions and one airborne brigade, Russian military sources say."  "The Prime Minister's office has issued a directive to the ministry to prepare a Russian "wish list" for Washington seeking some level of quid pro quo, including steps to return Russian oil companies to Iraq and approval of Russia's joining the World Trade Organization."  This is for real.  Bush may have Russian boots on the ground by October.  And it looks like Putin had to  urlLink knock some heads  to get his people on board.  Thanks to  urlLink Scoop Agonist  for always being on top of the shiznit.

         There will plenty of soul searching this political season as the democratic faithful try to find something to like about John Kerry.  We'll be out there urging people to vote, and we'd like to give people something - anything - to vote for rather than against.  We know the environmental platform is solid, and we're fairly certain that Kerry might once have been a hero during a war at some point.  This post aims to bring you some of the pieces of Kerry that I intend to focus on until November 3 and to update you on the campaign machinations.  I have oodles of teeth gnashing to do about the pro-war, bet-hedging aristocrat, but I'll bear his banner until he wins or loses.  Disclaimer complete.  On with the show...  John Kerry Rocks.   urlLink Listen to High School JFK  with his band, The Electras.   urlLink Kerry's writing his own convention speech .  With a pen and something called paper.  Here's  urlLink the Environmental stance  I mentioned.  You've seen the picture of a young, passionate John Kerry testifying before the Senate in 1971, now  urlLink read the transcript or hear the testimony : "How do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam? How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?"  Kerry WebSite area, Dbunker, gets downright snarky in its description of the  urlLink Highlights from the Republican Party Platform .  Excerpt:  "PUT RIGHT-WING IDEOLOGY FIRST: We recognize that we need to cater to our right wing base rather than pesky moderates like Nancy Reagan and Orrin Hatch. Therefore we will put ideology over science and deny all credible scientific evidence that stem cell research will save lives and that global warming exists."   Kerry's raised more money than he can spend.  He'll try, but then the DNC will get the remainder.  And, boy howdy, those DNCers are going to throw money at advertising like Aunt Susie at her first Chippendales show.  The month after the Democratic National Convention will be  urlLink blanket advertising from Kerry  while the Bush admin tries to roll out Bush 3.0.  The Bushies will be spending like crazy too, because after the nominating conventions each candidate will be stuck with a measly $75 million of taxpayer money.    So Scrutiny Hooligans are hoping that  urlLink Kerry's Army of Lawyers  are offering their services pro bono in the interest of doing away with Bush's quid pro quo.  See you on Embrace The Face Friday!  And, if you live in North Carolina, get your bloggy selves down to the polling place tomorrow and gitcho democracy on.

           "It's unfair, it's slanted and it's a hit job. And I haven't even seen it yet." -Eric Shawn, FOX News Reporter   Tonight Scrutiny Hooligans will be attending a local screening of  urlLink Outfoxed , the film created to draw something other than a winkwinknudgenudge from the media establishment about its willingness to accept and emulate Fox's broadcast propaganda.  Rupert Murdoch is pissed but not panicked.  He's set out to starve the movie of media, and when that isn't possible he's calling the movie ridiculous and the director criminal.  The  urlLink Wall Street Journal  has taken the film to task for being full of innuendoes, slick editing, and emotional ranting.  WSJ compares it to F9/11, and that's a film I've seen.  F9/11 has been deconstructed extensively across the web, and what's clear is that those who attack these films for providing only one narrative point of view (that of the liberal director) never go on to address the facts introduced in the movie.  The facts.  The facts.  The facts.  Our conservative adversaries can't dispute the fact that FoxNews released a memo advising it's writers that "It's a distinctly skeptical crowd that Bush faces. His political courage and tactical cunning are worth noting in our reporting through the day.".  They can't dispute the 9 minutes that Bush sat deer-in-the-headlights style reading My Pet Goat.    The word of mouth and submedia buzz about this film, provided in large part by moveon.org and Center for American Progress, has made it Amazon.com's #1 selling DVD.   urlLink Editor and Publisher  reports, "Fox News issued a statement accusing The New York Times of cooperating with "illegal copyright infringement actions" and corrupting "the journalistic process.""  See all of the Fox memos  urlLink HERE  (thanks Wonkette!).  Eric Alterman  urlLink delivers the smackdown  to Fox apologists, "With so much of what Americans see, read, and hear controlled by larger and less accountable multinational conglomerates, the underlying basis of a democratic exchange of ideas becomes a utopian fantasy. Americans are starting to sense this as the rise of a mass, populist movement in opposition to media concentration has demonstrated. Right now, the lack of credibility of so much of the media when it comes to reporting politics is the networks' loss and a gadfly documentarians' gain."  I'll be viewing the movie at 7pm EST.  Go to  urlLink outfoxed.org  to get more info.

       &nbsp;  Political bumper stickers, t-shirts, buttons, yard signs, storefront signs,&nbsp;culture jamming are most effective when the eyes looking at them are part of your candidate's target audience.&nbsp; Here in&nbsp;the Asheville, North Carolina area,&nbsp; urlLink Two Million tourists &nbsp;descend on Asheville throughout the spring and summer&nbsp;and leaf season.&nbsp;Many of the people visiting will have had little or no contact with progressive cities or mainstream democratic values. Many are from rural areas where the Bush myth is alive&nbsp;and well.&nbsp;The&nbsp;more these tourists see&nbsp;Kerry/Edwards or Anti-Bush gear, the more likely they are to associate&nbsp;their good Asheville experiences&nbsp;with the messages.  &nbsp;  I'm not saying that bumper stickers change minds.&nbsp; They don't.&nbsp; But they influence those voters who&nbsp;rarely tune in to the political debate and who rarely vote.&nbsp; I've been&nbsp;wearing&nbsp;a Patsy Keever for Congress button for weeks now, and I've been struck&nbsp;by how few people comment on it after they notice it.&nbsp;&nbsp;But every time&nbsp;the viewer&nbsp;associates my smiling face with my candidate's name, I've moved the undecided or&nbsp;unlikely voter a little closer to where I want 'em.  &nbsp;  Scrutiny Hooligans&nbsp;are happy to sell you  urlLink political gear , of course.&nbsp; But wherever you find&nbsp;a message that&nbsp;you can&nbsp;get&nbsp;behind, put&nbsp;it where the tourists can see it.&nbsp; It's an easy way to&nbsp;affect a lot of people.

          George W. Bush believes that tax cuts are good no matter what. He believes that the federal goverment should get out of people's lives unless those people are defense contractors or&nbsp;corporate welfare recipients.&nbsp; To advance his agenda, Bush (with support of the nation's Republican and Democratic legislators) has taken our nation from a sizable surplus to the largest deficit in history.&nbsp; In order to reduce the deficit, Bush proposes cutting spending.&nbsp; This smacks of sound financial planning, yes?&nbsp; Let's look at what Fiscal Year 2006 budget holds and how it will affect each of us.  &nbsp;  First, some honkin' big numbers from  urlLink brillig.com :&nbsp;  The National Debt today stands at -  $7,275,167,294,755.53  or, for you english majors out there, Seven Trillion, Two Hundred and Seventy-Five Billion, One Hundred and Sixty-Seven Million, Two Hundred and Ninety-Four Thousand, Seven Hundred and Fifty-Five Dollars and Fifty-Three Cents   The estimated population of the United States is 293,761,925, so each citizen's share of this debt is $24,765.52.   The National Debt has continued to increase an average of$1.69 billion per day since September 30, 2003.  &nbsp;  The  urlLink Congressional Budget Office projects  deficits through 2012.&nbsp; This year's deficit spending is projected to be $477 Billion.&nbsp; If the CBO's numbers were to hold true, the National Debt will be closing in on Ten Trillion Dollars in 2012.&nbsp; The CBO's&nbsp;figures do not take into account the money yet to be spent in&nbsp;Iraq and Afghanistan.  &nbsp;  Bush is seeking a  urlLink One Trillion dollar increase  in the federal cap on&nbsp;the&nbsp;national debt.  &nbsp;  These&nbsp;numbers are the hidden context in which the Campaign debate over spending takes place.&nbsp; GWB has been running around touting his support for Education; Veterans; Nutrition Programs for women, infants, and children; Head Start; Home Ownership; Job-training; Medical Research; Science Programs, and so much more.&nbsp; While he touts on the trail, he slashes these very same programs in his budget.&nbsp; From  urlLink the Washington Post :   "Thomas S. Kahn, Democratic staff director on the House Budget Committee. "Next February, the administration plans to propose spending cuts in key government services to pay for oversized tax cuts."   'The administration has widely touted a $1.7 billion increase in discretionary funding for the Education Department in its 2005 budget, but the 2006 guidance would pare that back by $1.5 billion. The Department of Veterans Affairs is scheduled to get a $519 million spending increase in 2005, to $29.7 billion, and a $910 million cut in 2006 that would bring its budget below the 2004 level."   "Also slated for cuts are the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, the Small Business Administration, the Transportation Department, the Social Security Administration, the Interior Department and the Army Corps of Engineers."   "The Women, Infants and Children nutrition program was funded at $4.7 billion for the fiscal year beginning in October, enough to serve the 7.9 million people expected to be eligible. But in 2006, the program would be cut by $122 million. Head Start, the early-childhood education program for the poor, would lose $177 million, or 2.5 percent of its budget, in fiscal 2006."   "The $78 million funding increase that Bush has touted for a homeownership program in 2005 would be nearly reversed in 2006 with a $53 million cut. National Institutes of Health spending would be cut 2.1 percent in 2006, to $28 billion, after a $764 million increase for 2005 that brought the NIH budget to $28.6 billion. Even homeland security -- a centerpiece of the Bush reelection campaign -- would be affected. Funding would slip in 2006 by $1 billion, to $29.6 billion"&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Every time you hear GWB talk about supporting any of these programs, know that he is publicy stating his support while planning to withdraw it.&nbsp;&nbsp; FY2006's budget is George W. Bush's&nbsp;biggest campaign promise,&nbsp;&nbsp;a promise of less money for education, less money for health, less money for veterans, less money for family homes, less money for the Sciences, less money towards a greener America, less money for small business, less money for Homeland Security, etc.&nbsp; It's a campaign promise George W. will keep.&nbsp;

         &nbsp;  First the Chutzpah:&nbsp; "The  urlLink Associated Press  asked a federal judge Friday to order the Pentagon to quickly turn over a full copy of President Bush's military service record. "&nbsp; The spring, 2004 document dump left out important pieces of Bush's record, and the report that some Bush&nbsp;records were inadvertently destroyed hasn't ended the search.&nbsp; "Those records came from federal records clearinghouses. Texas law requires separate record keeping for state National Guard service, and those records should exist on microfilm in Austin, the AP said."&nbsp; Microfilm?&nbsp;Austin?&nbsp; Go Get 'Em, AP.  &nbsp;  More Chutzpah:&nbsp; Iyad Allawi, President of Iraq's Interim Government, former CIA operative, and  urlLink one-man security force  , is asking for  urlLink cannon fodder from Muslim nations .&nbsp; Bush/Rummy/Powell have been trying since the beginning of the Iraq invasion to get Islam on board for a war against itself, but no one's biting.  &nbsp;  Dual Polarity Chutzpah:&nbsp; When a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress that would provide for U.N. monitoring of the 2004 elections, the republican led House said " urlLink oh hell no ".&nbsp; Rep. Brown said, "I come from Florida, where you and others participated in what I call the United States coup d'etat. We need to make sure it doesn't happen again...Over and over again after the election when you stole the election, you came back here and said, 'Get over it.' No, we're not going to get over it. And we want verification from the world."&nbsp;&nbsp;House republicans ordered her remarks stricken from the record.&nbsp; We wouldn't want dissent on the record, would we Mr. Buyer?  &nbsp;  In any other time wouldn't be considered Chutzpah, but the Bush years render it so:&nbsp; Ohio Secretary of State  urlLink bans the use of Diebold Voting Machines  in 2004 general election.  &nbsp;  Now for the Hubris:&nbsp;  urlLink Slate provides  an excellent Mini-Cliff's Notes version of  Imperial Hubris: Why the West is Losing the War on Terror .  &nbsp;  Terrorists are hubristic too:&nbsp; This  urlLink State Department list of significant terrorist attacks  from 1961-2004 provides a daunting look at how the use of terrorist attacks has grown.  &nbsp;  Hubris and Iraq:&nbsp; The idea that any United States resident has any clear picture of the situation in Iraq straddles the hubris/arrogance/ignorance lines.&nbsp; Jim Hoagland lays out the freshest look at the  urlLink Perception Gap .&nbsp; "Iraq and the world will benefit if Allawi can deliver on his promises to establish stability and democracy. Wish him well. But a dangerous gap is opening up between the determinedly upbeat pronouncements in Washington and from Allawi, and more disinterested reports from the field. "  &nbsp;  The antidote to Hubris:&nbsp;  urlLink The Revealer , a daily review of religion and the press, publishes the side of the story that never makes it to print in these United States.

      Here is an email I got that annoyed me. After it is my response I mailed to the person who sent it to me.   ------email------    Sorry about more political info, but you can't know too much about the Kerry's:  Following is a brief background on Mrs. John Kerry . She hates being called that, by the way: Maria Teresa Thiersten Simoes-Ferreira Heinz Kerry. Married Senator Kerry in 1995. She only took his name eighteen months ago and she is an "interesting" paradox of conflicts......     urlLink READ THE REST HERE !   -----response------   As they say "The Devil mixes the truth with lies." And republicans get so mad at Moore for Fahrenheit 9/11. It makes me so happy to see them have to take their own medicine. The difference between the Heinz/Kerry email and Fahrenheit 9/11 is that Moore bases his opinion on facts. So my question here is, where are the facts?   Here's the bio of the "hate-monger" Soros, who has given more money to rebuilding some countries in a year than the U.S. as a whole:   "Soros has been active as a philanthropist since 1979, when he began providing funds to help black students attend the University of Cape Town in apartheid South Africa. Today he is chairman of the Open Society Institute (OSI) and the founder of a network of philanthropic organizations that are active in more than 50 countries. Based primarily in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union—but also in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the United States—these foundations are dedicated to building and maintaining the infrastructure and institutions of an open society. They work closely with OSI to develop and implement a range of programs focusing on civil society, education, media, public health, and human rights as well as social, legal, and economic reform. In recent years, OSI and the Soros foundations network have spent more than $400 million annually to support projects in these and other focus areas. In 1992, Soros founded Central European University, with its primary campus in Budapest."   Here's the link to the  urlLink G2 Bulletin  The G2 bulletin is actually called "Joseph Farah's G2 Bulletin" and it links from  urlLink www.worlddailynews.com    And on his web site it says, "Joseph Farah's G2 Bulletin is your independent, online intelligence resource edited and published by the veteran newsman and founder of WorldNetDaily.com. Each week he taps his vast network of international intelligence sources to bring you credible insights into geo-political and geo-strategic developments."   Who is this guy? Where does he get his info? What makes him an authority? Is he biased?   Where did they get their info on the Tides Foundation. Are we suppose to just take their word for it. I researched the Tides Foundation, and didn't see anything outside of the ordinary. Is there even a Democratic Justice Fund? I looked for it online and the only thing that came up was 100 links to postings of the Heinz/Kerry email I'm writing about. But nothing about the "Democratic Justice Fund." Does that fund even exists? If so, let's see some actual facts here.   Yes Heinz is rich, but what about and Bush and Cheney. They come from Oil money. Talk about calling the kettle black. Is oil money not as bad as ketchup money. I can bet if Kerry wins we won't be going to war so that we can keep up a good supply of Ketchup and make Heinz a little richer.   I could go on. Emails like this make me glad that Fahrenheit 9/11 is out and angering republicans and conservatives. They've been slinging half-truths, lies and bile (like the fact-devoid Heinz/Kerry email) for years. Luckily the real facts of Bush are coming out, and no amount of conservative/republican spin is gong to be able to save him. He's in for a bad summer and fall.

      Despite Uptown's well-intended warning, neither Hostettler or Delay will succeed in usurping the Supreme Court's ability to hear cases involving gay marriage, abortion, or even inert references to a civic deity in pledges and oaths.&nbsp; Though it is true that Congress has limited power to affect what is known as the 'appellate jurisdiction' of the Supreme Court, there are long-standing, constitutionally based restrictions on the exercise of an extremely limited power.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution vests the Supreme Court with appellate jurisdiciton regarding appeals based on both law and fact.&nbsp; The Constitution imparts this adjudicative power while curtailing its unfettered exercise by giving the legislative branch the ability to narrow that power through exceptions and regulations.&nbsp; Shortly after the Civil War, in the case of ex parte  McCardle,  a gun-shy Supreme Court upheld the ability of Congress to decide which claims could be appealed to the Nations' highest court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Historical revisionists like Hostettler and Delay, no doubt, cite the Exceptions Clause of Article III, Section 2, and the holding of  McCardle  as the basis for their attempts to write bigotry into law and strip jurisdiction from the Supreme Court.&nbsp; What they ignore, however, is the treatment of this separation of powers issue over the course of American judicial history.  &nbsp;  For example, following the Civil War, southern rebels were prevented from seeking indemnification or redress for property condemned or seized during the war.&nbsp; In an effort to heal a divided Nation, the Supreme Court decided to allow individuals with presidential pardons to seek such redress.&nbsp; Congress, maddened by the Supreme Court's sympathy to the rebels, passed a law limiting the jurisdiction of the Court so that it could not hear indemnification claims of those who were pardoned.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;Justices agreed that&nbsp;Congress' attempt to limit the Court's jurisdiction was an effort to control the outcome of a judicial decision in a pending matter, and consequently, struck down the law as unconstitutional.&nbsp;  In United States v. Klein (1872 ), the Supreme Court decided that Congress may not manipulate the jurisdiction of the ultimate&nbsp;decider of law and fact to control the outcome of a particular case.&nbsp; Though there are&nbsp;differences, what Hostettler or Delay propose would meet a similar fate.&nbsp; Arguably, the&nbsp;Supreme Court has already asserted jurisdiction over issues related to homosexuality&nbsp;and the separation of church and state, and as a result, any attempt to deny the Supreme Court the ability&nbsp;to apply its prior rulings to&nbsp;future cases would&nbsp;render previous decisions&nbsp;moot in a way prohibited under the constitution and the princple of&nbsp; stare   decisis.&nbsp;    Another legal concept that would thwart Hostettler and Delay's jurisdiction stripping efforts is the separation of powers principle built into the very foundation of our constitutional government.&nbsp; Because the Supreme Court plays a profound and essential role in the operation of the constitutional system of checks and balances, any attempt to deny the Court jurisdiction over a substantial class of cases like the ones noted by Uptown in his post "Legislative Fiat" would run contrary to the constitutional plan and would be struck down.  There are limitations on the ability of Congress to make exceptions to the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court implicit in the language of the Amendments to the Constitution.&nbsp; Think about it, the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause would automatically prohibit the ability of Congress to give straights greater access to justice than gays, or men greater access than women in the case of abortion, or&nbsp;believers greater access than atheists.  In 1995, the Supreme Court in  Plaut v. Spendthrift Farms&nbsp; ruled that Congress could not open up final judgments of Article III courts and alter a decision of the Supreme Court that had already been entered.&nbsp;  Lawrence  and  Roe v. Wade  can only be revisited by the Court itself.  Finally, in  Michaelson v. United States (1924) , the Supreme Court ruled that the legislative branch cannot alter federal court jurisdiction in a manner that would violate individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution or eliminate the lower courts' only available remedies to redress violations of those rights, like appeal to the Supreme Court.  Be afraid of Hostettler and Delay for other reasons, Uptown, but not for their attempts at jurisdiction stripping.&nbsp; They are exercises in futility.&nbsp; No student of the constitution, conservative, liberal or otherwise, would recognize the legitimacy of what they are attempting to do.&nbsp; It is a last ditch effort to mobilize a fundamentalist base to fund their radical views.&nbsp; Nothing more.

         &nbsp;  When the Anti-Marriage amendment to the Constitution died in the Senate, all of us who have been watching and acting let out a sigh of relief and a gasp of incredulity as 48 Senators voted in favor.&nbsp; Well...those 48 aren't the only ones to be keeping our eyes on.&nbsp; House Republicans led by Tom "Lawyer Up" Delay seek to sidestep the courts by quickly passing  urlLink H.R. 3313, Marriage Protection Act of 2003  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; urlLink The Hill reports :  "Rep. John Hostettler’s (R-Ind.) “jurisdiction stripping” bill would bar federal courts from hearing lawsuits related to gay sex and marriage. &nbsp;   Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) told reporters yesterday that he plans to use “jurisdiction stripping” measures to achieve other social policy goals as well... For example, he will push legislation to stop federal courts from hearing lawsuits related to the words “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance. &nbsp;  The U.S. Constitution establishes only the Supreme Court but leaves it to Congress to “ordain and establish” the lower federal courts. Arguably, therefore, Congress has the right determine the federal courts’ jurisdiction."   [Tom Delay added,] "“The protection-of-marriage amendment is not an offensive action; it is a defensive action taken in direct response to the brazen usurpation of legislative authority by four judges in Boston.” "DeLay said the time is “not quite ripe” to apply the GOP’s new legislative tactics to the issue of abortion."   Write your representative  urlLink RIGHT NOW .&nbsp; Tom Delay isn't going to&nbsp;wait to push this through.&nbsp;

       urlLink Gary Trudeau and Bush were Classmates.   Interesting view into Bush personality:  "Even then he had clearly awesome social skills. Legend has it that he knew the names of all forty-five of his fellow pledges when he rushed Deke. He later became rush chairman of Deke -- I do believe he has the soul of a rush chairman. He has that ability to connect with people. Not in the empathetic way that Clinton was so good at, but in the way of making people feel comfortable.  He could also make you feel extremely uncomfortable. He was very good at all the tools for survival that people developed in prep school -- sarcasm, and the giving of nicknames. He was extremely skilled at controlling people and outcomes in that way. Little bits of perfectly placed humiliation."

          The ghosts of Phnom Penh seem awake today, perhaps shaken by the footsteps of glass-eyed tourists, or perhaps kept in perpetual wakefulness by bleak monochrome photographs and the bellowing horrors of the past.      Tuol Sleng is a strange compund of ironies. The chinning bars and grass courtyard, the nursery, the tiled classrooms, all edged by the jagged shadows of barbed wire. It was a school, its concrete walls echoing with the sounds of children and the warm anesthetic of suburban life. But Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge needed the space (and was generally opposed to dangerous institutions like schools). Tuol Sleng became the infamous S-21 prison and interrogation center. Here, in the dusty mediocrity of downtown Phnom Penh, the laughter of children was swallowed by the empty howls of thousands, tortured and killed for the crime of disbelief.     Most people have not heard of Tuol Sleng (I had not, before today). Without "The Killing Fields," many of us would not even know that Cambodia underwent nearly 4 years of genocide that matches the Nazi holocaust on every level but numbers. Pol Pot is a name, perhaps, associated with the news and some foreiegn country, but that is all. But like all monsters, his reality was human.      So I walked through the dusty halls of Tuol Sleng, confronted by the simple horrors of 3 foot x 4 foot cells, with the iron shackles still attached to the walls, the electrical cables for whipping and interrogation still in place, left almost casually as if the user intended to return. And, perhaps, if we do not look closely enough at what he left behind, he will.      It occurs to me, as I write this, that no country, no corner of the world, no generation, perhaps no decade, is free of this type of brutality. Perhaps the evidence is not always so clearly preserved. Perhaps its consequences not so apparent. But it is there. It is not owned by history, or by "others." It is a shared proclivity for brutality. A shared fascination and seeming need to oppress, humiliate, and dehumanize.      But still we look at these places - Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Tuol Sleng, the Coffin Ships - and tell ourselves that it won't happen again. That it could not, not today. Not anymore. We have learned, the world has changed. But has it?      I wonder.

         President Bush has refused to release a one-page document spelling out mistaken intelligence facts given to him in the run-up to the War in Iraq.   urlLink The New York Times reports , " The administration and the C.I.A. say the White House is protected by executive privilege " from releasing this document.  Further,         "The review, prepared for President Bush in October 2002, summarized the findings of a classified, 90-page National Intelligence Estimate about Iraq's illicit weapons. Congressional officials said that notes taken by Senate staffers who were permitted to review the document show that it eliminated references to dissent within the government about the National Intelligence Estimate's conclusions."   This article clearly lays out a case that Bush didn't know that the intelligence was bad, that many hands within the administration orchestrated what the President could know about possible weapons in Iraq.  It's possible that any mentions of doubts, counterclaims, opposing views, or contradictions were removed from the information Bush saw.  We know Bush is an uncurious man.  We know he had a vendetta aganst Iraq.  We know he sees the world through the good v. evil lens of dry drunk fundamentalism.  And we know that he surrounded himself with people who have known him his entire life.  If this story is to be believed, Bush is the Pinocchio to Whose Geppeto?  List your guesses in our comments section.

         El Enemigo The Enemy  My old enemy came to visit today: a man hermetically sealed in his truth, like a castle or strong-box, with his own style of breathing and a singular sword-play sedulously stropped to draw blood.  I saw the years in his face: the eyes of tired water, the lines of his loneliness that had lifted his temples little by little to consummate self-love.  We chatted a while in broad mid-day, in windy explosions that scattered the sun on all sides and struck at the sky. But the man showed me only his new set of keys, his one way to all doors.  Inside him, I think he was silent, indivisibly silent: the flint of this soul stayed impenetrable.  I thought of that stingy integrity hopelessly buried, with power to harm only himself; and within me I knew my own crude truths shamed.  So we talked - each of us honing his steely convictions, each tempered by time: two blind men defending their individual darknesses.  - Pablo Neruda, from  Five Decades: Poems 1925-1970 , translated by Ben Belitt

        First, Scroll down to  urlLink Seizing Power  for the latest on BushCo's efforts to hold sway over whether elections take place this November.  While Governor Jeb "he ain't heavy" Bush has decided that the ridiculously flawed  urlLink felon voter lists  in Florida will be scrapped, his Division of Elections has decided to go ahead with plans to  urlLink exclude touch screen voting machines  from recount eligibility.    In other Bush/Cheney '04 news, the Bush Administration has advised the Pakistani Government to announce the capture of High Value Targets...  urlLink during the Democratic National Convention .  Who's playing politics with national security?  The pseudosovereign Iraq has a new problem.  The U.N. resolution establishing their limited, full, conditional, absolute sovereignty also ended a 14-year-old arms embargo.  That's right, it's now perfectly legal  urlLink to arm Iraq to the teeth , and the U.S. Department of Unfathomable Repetition of Historical Mistakes is there to exploit the market.

Everyone ready for a middle east arms race?   urlLink From Paul Krugman in the New York Times , "Will actual policy issues play any role in this election? Not if the White House can help it. But if some policy substance does manage to be heard over the clanging of conveniently timed terror alerts, voters will realize that they face some stark choices. Here's one of them: tax cuts for the very well-off versus health insurance."  Krugman goes on to help we democrats reframe.  The Union of Concerned Scientists  urlLink repeats the mantra , "The Bush administration is still packing scientific advisory panels with ideologues and is imposing strict controls on researchers who want to share ideas with colleagues in other countries, a group of scientists charged on Thursday."  John Ashcroft recused himself from the investigation of the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame.   urlLink So why did he receive  "numerous detailed briefings last year regarding the criminal investigation of the unauthorized disclosure of a CIA agent's identity, during which he was told specific information relating to the potential culpability of several close political associates in the Bush administration, according to senior federal law-enforcement sources."  This article also describes testimony of Karl Rove to investigators in which he admits to disseminating the information.   Rove likes to endanger undercover operatives almost as much as he likes distorting his opponents' records.  Next time you hear someone call Kerry a flip-flopper, be ready with  urlLink this handy list  of Bush Administration flip-flops...Karl would be proud.

          urlLink Make it this one .  OUTFOXED premieres tomorrow, and today's New York Times Magazine features the film.  Rupert Murdoch is fickin'a'be upset.  Why?  Read this excerpt:  "The most stinging blow that ''Outfoxed'' delivers to Fox's ''fair and balanced'' claim comes in a segment of the film on the daily memos apparently sent to the entire Fox news operation by John Moody, Fox News's senior vice president for news and editorial. The memos, which Greenwald says were provided by two unnamed employees at the network, set the agenda for how events will be covered. One memo, thought to have been circulated at Fox in April, instructs employees how to report on the increasing number of American fatalities in Iraq: ''Do not fall into the easy trap of mourning the loss of U.S. lives,'' it reads. Another memo outlines the approach to covering the United States military's siege on Falluja: ''It won't be long before some people start to decry the use of 'excessive force,''' it says. ''We won't be among that group.'' A third, on the 9/11 Commission, is equally firm: ''The fact that former Clinton and both former and current Bush administration officials are testifying gives it a certain tension, but this is not 'what did he know and when did he know it' stuff,'' it cautions. ''Do not turn this into Watergate.'"

         George W. Bush  urlLink wants to explain to you  that John Kerry is out of step with mainstream American values like homophobia, racism, naked aggression, lying, and doing away with the constitution.  JK/JE want to win the values argument, and with an opponent like Bush, it ought to be a freakin' cakewalk.  Exhibit A:  From the WaPo's article entitled, " urlLink As Rationales for War Erode, Issue of Blame Looms Large ", "Yesterday's report by the Senate intelligence committee left in shreds two of the Bush administration's main rationales for the war in Iraq: that Iraq had illicit weapons and that it cooperated with al Qaeda." There's nothing left except, as the invader-in-chief told the crowd, "I'll tell you what we do know. Saddam Hussein had the capacity to make weapons."  Well so does my Grandmother.  She has internet access, some swarthy friends, and an unsavory look about her when she thinks of baseball.  Look out Grandma, BushCo. might get all pre-emptive on your ass.  Bush Value illustrated by this:  America will unapologetically kill ten thousand civilian Iraqis in order to protect Americans from impotent dictators.  Murder is ok.  Exhibit B:  Also from today's WaPo, " urlLink Bush criticizes NAACP leadership ", Bush snubs NAACP convention for the fourth year running.  Back in 2000 when he visited the group, which has invited the Preznit every year since then to speak, Bush said that "there is much we can do together to advance racial harmony and economic opportunity."  Well, Bush hasn't done anything to do either.  "But he castigated the group's officers, who include President Kweisi Mfume and Chairman Julian Bond. "I would describe my relationship with the current leadership as basically nonexistent," Bush said, as reported by Knight Ridder Newspapers. "You've heard the rhetoric and the names they've called me."   The names they've called him?  The NAACP told WaPo that Bush is first President since Harding not to visit the group's convention.  Bush Value:  I can't decide on this one... It's either: Black people that call me names and won't stop complaining don't get to have an advocate in the White House, OR My racist base hates you people, so call me when you learn to act like Condi and Colin.  Exhibit C:  "Bush speaks out against Gay Marriage" again.  I covered this issue with gusto yesterday ( urlLink HERE ), so I'll just include some quotes from some Anti-Marriage Amendment supporters.  " urlLink This  is a complete outrage! Now gays can dephile the sancity of marriage. The marriage I have to my wife has just been insulted since now those rump ranging Faggots can do the same thing. Fags EAT their own FECES! They lick each others rectum!!! THEY CALL IT TOSSING THE SALAD!! Salad of what?! Vomit?! That's probably what they bathe in those FILTHY FAGGOTS!! DIE DIE DIE!!!"  AND  " urlLink The (homosexual) agenda  is not about tolerance; it is about silencing and forcing compliance with the rigid demands of the homosexual lobby."   Bush Values:  Gay Americans are not entitled to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.  Homosexuals are second class citizens.  Codifying Bigotry is ok.  Exhibit D:   urlLink George W. Bush was AWOL  during his stint in the Texas Air National Guard.  There has been much ink spent on this story, and the most recent development is that  urlLink the Pentagon reports  accidentally destroying the portion of Bush's record that might illuminate where he was.  UPDATE:   urlLink Bush records destroyed by then Gov. Bush's chief of staff, Allbaugh, according to eyewitness .  Bush Values:  Avoid Danger while hastily sending other peoples' children into a unnecessary war in which tens of thousands of people have died.  Lie.  Lie.  Lie.  Gosh, if I had more time and space I'd present E) destroying the environment; F) cutting social programs while cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans; G) Denying civil and legal rights to American citizens; H) Undermining democracy by ignoring computerized voting problems; I) Trumpeting Christian values while ignoring Christian teachings.  In closing, let me present some old news.  Let it guide you when deciding how to cast your vote this November.    Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are the meek: for they shall possess the land. Blessed are they who mourn: for they shall be comforted.  Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after justice: for they shall have their fill. Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the clean of heart: for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.  Blessed are they that suffer persecution for justice' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

       UPDATE:  You can purchase the documentary, titled "OUTFOXED: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism", or just see clips  urlLink HERE .     Matt Drudge has let us in on a movie premiere slated for Monday in NYC.  The 'documentary' declares:  A) the earth is a sphere B) most birds can, indeed, fly C) the pope wears a spectacular chapeau D) Fox News has a republican party bias  The New York Times is going to hype the film by reviewing it and reporting about reactions to it.  Fox News threatens to flame MSNBC and CNN by revealing how they make editorial decisions.  This could be a beautiful war.  Everybody trying to say that they're more fair and balanced than everyone else while trying desperately to maintain their biases without being made to change.  A great self-righteous pissing match ought to get underway forthwith.  I wonder when Fox will stop the strong arm bully tactics? (remember Al Franken's Fair and Balanced Flap?) Oh yeah, they'll probably stop trying to bully people about the same time the Bush admin stops trying to bully the world.   urlLink Read The Scoop From Drudge.

         As promised by the P.Hack All-Star, here's a look at your government's endeavor to Defend Marriage by making some kinds of marriage illegal...forever.  The text of H.J. 56:  " urlLink JOINT RESOLUTION  Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States relating to marriage .  Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years after the date of its submission for ratification:  "Article --   "SECTION 1. Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution or the constitution of any State, nor state or federal law, shall be construed to require that marital status or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon unmarried couples or groups."    First things first, the Radical Conservatives in the Senate who support the ban on gay marriage are also against any legal recognition of same-sex couples.  Note the language, "...or the legal incidents thereof..."  This is more than an effort to ban gay marriage, it is the legalization and legitimization of homophobia, bigotry towards homosexuals, and a fundamentalist, right-wing biblical worldview.    The mainstream media is still whistling the Rovian tune of gay marriage, but even some republicans are starting to get it.  Lincoln Chafee (R-RI): "To be seen as the party that's coming between two people that love each other doing what they want to do ... to me that's going to be seen as a liability, politically." Brian Halley at The Blue Lemur puts it  urlLink like this .  The Republican fear of homosexuals and homosexual culture/lifestyles matches in intensity their fear of terrorists, and they will exercise the same Orwellian tactics in fighting the evil menace. Even when a High-Ranking official in the Bush Administration, the V.P. F.U. himself, has an openly gay daughter - there is no discussion that limiting an American's right to life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness might be a violation of everything for which America stands.  At  urlLink Dear Mary , visitors are offered the opportunity to send Mary an email requesting that she stand up for the rights of homosexual Americans: "Dear Mary, your father Vice President Cheney supports adding anti-gay prejudice to the US Constitution, making you and millions of other Americans second-class citizens. As an open lesbian who has been a public advocate for gay civil rights, won't you join us in publicly opposing this bigoted un-American proposal?"  The site is free and open, and many have written vitriolic hate letters to Mary.     urlLink Meet the people  who support this amendment: -  "Human rights are equal, too bad queers are not what God intended humans to be. Too bad...nyah, nyah, nyah Aids cures faggotry." -  "You all are some sick mother fuckers, but then since gays or lezzies can't have kids by themselves, maybe not. The more you push the more we will push back. Get used to it. Marriage was, is, and always will be one man one woman. Get over yourselves. You are not that important." -  "You are bringing God's judgement over San Francisco... no wonder why so many quakes happen over there...Just because of your lives being destroyed during your childhood, it doesn't mean you have the right to destroy new generation lives too. Even lives that are potentially destroyed (children in adoption).   THIS KIND OF ACTS WILL KILL YOUR SOCIETY. You try to cover under the "liberty" statement, but that liberty is "slavery" in reality. AND YOU KNOW IT. Gay marriage is a selfish act. They think only in themselves...and base on what they feel in the moment and move TRUTH appart.  Please think about it." -  "You are a sin filled lesbian who will probably burn in hell for eternity. Please change your ways and accept God into your life."   ...and lastly...this writer figures out why America is becoming reviled around the globe :  -  "Gays and lesbians disgust me to the bone, and quite frankly, I think it disgusts the vast majority of this nation. No wonder a growing number of nations are beginning to detest the USA.  We are becoming more lawless as the generations progress. These countries scoff at us when they see you people prance around in the streets as if your "alternate" lifestyle is normal. Well it's not.  Now, you filthy people are trying to raise children, and you are failing miserably at it. All you are doing is INFECTING our offspring with the idea that it is acceptable to live with no discipline or morals, and ultimately you will be held accountable for your actions."  I believe the Reverend Al Sharpton put it best when he said, during a primary debate, (paraphrased) "Unless you are willing to say that homosexuals are not human, then you must oppose this amendment because marriage is a  human right ."  As a married person in this country, I can attest to the emotional, spiritual, financial, and community benefits of the institution of marriage.  This amendment attacks my heterosexual marriage by demeaning it.  To tell the American people that their marriages will be less meaningful if oppressed Americans are also allowed to marry is to devalue marriage in a more profound way than any cultural group ever will.  I could go on about the strength of American marriage as it stands now.  I could go on about the fact that of all the civil unions and gay marriages since Vermont, only 3 have filed for divorce/dissolution.  I could go on about how many Americans identify themselves as homosexual and how many open homosexuals are captains of business and government.  I could go on about how bigotry and oppression pathologize homosexual feelings and behavior and how this pathologizing actually helps to foster anxiety, depression, and more in many people who would otherwise be normal, happy, well-adjusted and successful.  Instead, let me say that if you support the amendment or if you're just not sure how to feel about it, maybe it would help you to meet more homosexuals or to recognize them when you see them.  urlLink From the Seattle Times : "For the first time in U.S. history, the 2000 census counted gays and lesbians. Not all gays and lesbians Â just those living together as partners Â but still, the effect of the unprecedented count was tremendous. It made visible a minority group that until 2000 had been, demographically speaking, invisible."   The Gay and Lesbian Atlas, authored by Gary J. Gates, (The Urban Institute Press, 229 pp., $49.50), is a colorful and user-friendly compilation of the 2000 census data on homosexuals.  "When informed that 55 of those same-sex couples were living in his hometown, Republican state Sen. Dean Kirby  [from Mississippi]  told the paper, "Surely you jest! Wow! I have never met any of those people."  Celebrate Love.  Celebrate Family.  Oppose Bigotry.  Oppose Hate and Fear.   urlLink Write your Senator right now.

           Simply put, a tort is a civil wrong for which the law provides redress.  There are several categories of tort, too numerous to list.  They range from the more egregious intentionally-committed torts, like assault, false imprisonment, defamation, or fraud, to the oops-I-did-it-again variety of torts resulting from negligent behavior, like medical malpractice, slip-and-falls, or faulty products.       Joining the panoply of legal issues that make their way into the spotlight of national debate, like abortion, equal rights, and gay marriage (go, Screwy, go), tort reform is rapidly becoming a hot topic, at least among political pundits and partisans.  The recent addition of former trial lawyer Senator John Edwards to the Democratic Presidential ticket has renewed the wrangling over this sleeping giant.  From the moment Edwards' selection was announced, BushCo was ready to sound the battle-cry against the Democrats' long-standing special interest group, the plaintiff's bar.  What is this elusive, yet eminently divisive, animal affectionately referred to as tort reform?  Are Republicans resoundingly pro-tort reform, and Democrats uniformly opposed?  What are the constitutional implications of tort reform?       At risk of oversimplification, tort reform is a political movement to restrict and/or cap the amount of monetary damages that a plaintiff may be awarded in a civil suit, particularly, those suits that involve medical malpractice or products liability.  Supporters of tort reform, stereotypically insurance companies and major manufacturers, argue that inordinately large monetary awards have a chilling effect on business interests, drive insurance companies from local markets, result in consolidation of industry into mega-corporations that monopolize production and stymie competition, and pass on costs to consumers.  In states like Alabama, where most major insurance carriers refuse to locate home offices because of outrageous awards in civil suits, the aforementioned arguments are certainly valid.       On the other hand, opponents of tort reform declare that laws restricting damages in civil suits take away one of the fundamental elements of our constitutional government, namely, our Seventh Amendment right to trial by jury:             In suits at common law, where the value in           controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the            right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and           no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise           re-examined in any court of the United States,           than according to the rules of the common law.        In other words, by imposing limits on how much money can be awarded to a plaintiff, the legislature replaces the jury as the ultimate trier of fact when it comes to determining the amount of damage inflicted by the tortfeasor on the injured party.  If the jury decides to award 14 million dollars to a plaintiff suing for an injury resulting from carelessly spilled hot coffee, opponents of tort reform contend, then so be it.  Moreover, they argue that the facts of each case are so inherently unique that it would be difficult to fashion a 'prohibition of excessive damages' law that would adequately address every situation fairly.  As a final note, opponents of tort reform point out that the rules of civil procedure already contain a provision that allows courts to review damage awards in civil cases.   Remittitur  is the process by which a court reduces or proposes to reduce the damages awarded in a jury verdict.  Consequently, tort reform is an unnecessary foray of the legislature in an area of law that is normally the sole province of courts and juries.       There are some obvious objections to the claims above.  For instance, the drafters of the Seventh Amendment could not have conceived of a time when jury awards would become so outrageous that they would effectively choke business from a particular market, nor did they plan for a segment of the legal community that would earn its keep simply by suing insurance companies.  Furthermore, though the process of remittitur is a long-standing legal concept, it is rarely used because of political reasons.  Remember, most judges, excluding those who sit on federal benches, are elected by the citizens of a state or county, and are loathe to undermine the wishes of the people who vote them into power.        Unfortunately, the battle over tort reform is waged along party lines.  Republicans, the party of big business, see tort reform as a goal worthy of pursuing, often zealously and unthinkingly.  Democrats, as beholden as they are to trial lawyers' associations and the ABA, have a knee-jerk reaction to any mention of tort reform.  There is a middle way.        As mentioned above, torts exist along a spectrum, from intentional torts to negligence resulting in injury.  When an individual acts purposefully and the consequences of those actions are damages to another, a jury should be free to determine the extent of the injury and the gravity of the damages resulting therefrom.  However, when negligence or oversight is the proximate cause of injury, the lack of intentionality should be considered in the law's calculus of damages.  Thus, herein lies the wiggle room for lawmakers who take seriously the threats to business climates and the costs to consumers generated by enormous awards in civil suits as well as the rights we enjoy under the Constitution.  Like most issues of domestic importance, the issue of tort reform can only be resolved through thoughtful and deliberate steps toward middle ground.

      . . . Weapons of Mass Distraction, that is.  War, war, war, as the drumbeat continues to sound throughout the halls of the West Wing, other issues have been sublimated and, for many Americans, summarily dismissed as arguments over Iraq and intelligence failures dominate headlines.  Should the smoke clear and the Iraqi situation improve, will Americans have the stick-to-it-ness needed to take a level-headed look at the stark differences over domestic issues that the two campaigns have to offer?  For instance, read in today's NYT an insightful look at the  urlLink  Kerry Health Plan  .  Although it falls short of what this Hooligan would devise to cure our Nation's health care ills, a Republican alternative is virtually non-existent.  Similarly, there are competing takes on the issue of  urlLink  tort reform  .  The BushCo take on the issue, in its oh-so-endearing, oversimplifying way, is that because Edwards was once a trial lawyer, he is implicitly opposed to any tort reform (I'll be posting an analysis of the debate over tort reform shortly.)  Read  urlLink  here   a comparison by writers at the Christian Science Monitor of the opposing economic visions for America.  Oh, yeah, and while Kerry may be a waffler, there is new evidence that Bush may be a  urlLink http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/0704/09bushrecords.html"> concealer   of records past.  (Pentagon claims today that some of W's Alabama National Guard records were "inadvertently" destroyed.)  And, finally, duplicity abounds.  Senator Carl Levin, in an interview with hard-hitting telejournalist Katie Kuric (sorry, I slept late this morning), complained that the Republican members of the Senate committee investigating the run-up to and aftermath of 9/11 are withholding the portion of their report evaluating the Bush Administration until after the November election.  However, in an act of sheer political hog-waller, the Senate is forcing Democrats to reveal their deepest feelings about BushCo's proposed Gay Marriage Amendment  urlLink  before   the Democratic National Convention.  [NOTE:  Fellow Hooligan Screwy appears to be preparing a diatribe against BushCo's attempt to manhandle Congress into signing hate into law through a constitutional amendment.  I'm sure the aforementioned Hooligan will stress that this represents only the second time in our national history that an amendment has been proposed to restrict individual freedoms, rather than expand them (Prohibition, notwithstanding), and the first time those restrictions would apply to only one faction of society.]

      UPDATE:  "US President George W. Bush walks away from a briefing with the media, refusing to answer questions after he was asked about Enron and the reported indictment of former CEO Kenneth Lay, who was a close adviser and fund-raiser for Bush and his father, earning him the presidential nickname of 'Kenny Boy.'(AFP/Paul J. Richards)"  See the picture of  urlLink the Preznitential posterior  saying SeeYa! to that nosy press corps.      George W. Bush would like you to think that that Kenneth Lay guy is just a bad apple that nobody from his administration would have deigned to share a glass of O'Douls with.  Back when Enron went belly up, Bush  urlLink let the press know  that Lay was a Democrat.  "I got to know Ken Lay when he was the head of the—what they call the Governor's Business Council in Texas. He was a supporter of Ann Richards in my run in 1994 [italics Chatterbox's]. And she had named him the head of the Governor's Business Council. And I decided to leave him in place, just for the sake of continuity. And that's when I first got to know Ken. …", January 17, 2002.  The problem is that he donated three times as much to Bush's campaign as he did to Richards' campaign.  Oops!  And Ken Lay was a  urlLink Bush Pioneer in 2000 .  In fact, their relationship goes back to 1986, when a struggling Spectrum 7 partnered with Enron, headed by newly named Chairman Ken Lay, in at least one business deal.  The Smoking Gun has unearthed a pile of letters between the two men.   urlLink Read them  and see that the two clearly had a buddybuddy relationship.  Corporate greed fueled GWB's rise to the presidency.  The Lay relationship is just one aspect of a Bush worldview that rewards the 'have mores' with access to all the power that comes with 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.

         OR   ????  As the mainstream media searches deeply for the real meaning behind  urlLink John Kerry's history as a criminal prosecutor  and John Edwards' history as a trial lawyer, the Bush campaign has started repeating the following, "trial lawyer, trial lawyer, trial lawyer", in order to prove that Edwards is evil incarnate.   urlLink Slacktivist cuts through the sputum .  But, if you love and trust Ann Coulter, then you'll know that JE is evil not because he is a trial lawyer, but  urlLink because he is rich and kills mothers .  Tom DeLay likes trial lawyers.  He likes them so much that he's just  urlLink hired two of them  to keep his ass out of the dock.    Ken Lay has a deck of lawyers, and he's still going to get buried  urlLink under whichever country club jail  he's put into.  If I needed a lawyer, I'd probably call Partisan Hack.  But if you're out after dark in the new, sovereign, democratic, free, stable, shining hope of the middle east, Iraq,  urlLink ain't no lawyer gonna be able to help you .  President and former CIA operative Iyad Allawi puts it like this, "The law ... is really designed to protect lives in Iraq, whether these lives are Iraqis or friends of Iraq," Allawi said. "We will use the law ... whenever it is necessary to defeat our enemies."   So, for those of you holding your scorecards, here's the rundown: John Kerry:    Good Lawyer John Edwards:  Good Lawyer Ann Coulter:  Not a lawyer but she knows who she hates Tom DeLay:  Too dumb to be a lawyer, and too mean to care. Ken Lay:   The biggest crook in history has some big lawyers who won't be there when it comes time to sacrifice the starfish. Iyad Allawi:  Trained by CIA to work outside the law unless it is expedient to do otherwise.

      [NOTE: Hooligans, this is my last word on this divisive, decidedly unsexy, topic. Apparently, rants are all the rage, and in an epoch of 'round the clock commentary, entertainment is god.]   In her groundbreaking work on the Gospel of Thomas, Biblical historian and scholar Elaine Pagels presents an alternate view of first century christianity that reveals the multiplicity of views regarding the relationship between faith and politics held by the earliest followers of Jesus. Once again, in "Beyond Belief," one of the few books from the left wing of christiandom to remain on the New York Times Bestseller's List for weeks on end, Pagels compares the nacent attempts by christian apologists to standardize and homogenize the teachings of Jesus to the current attempt by conservatives to hold hostage the rhetoric of faith for its own political ends.  urlLink  Here   Pagels articulates the basis of her fears:    The kind of Christianity that pervades the religious right in this country divides the world between the saved and the damned, between God's people and Satan's people, between good and evil. We have all seen how this is played out in our politics. I used to think that President Bush was using this language as a political ploy. I still think he is, but I also think—to my disappointment—that he also believes it. His conviction that he is God's chosen one to "rid the world of evildoers" blinds him to the evil that he—and we, as Americans—are capable of doing. The conviction that we are on the side of good—of God—is, however, an ancient one—enormously powerful.   I'm concerned about our country, because one can see how appeals to religion, like those that are currently being made by the religious right, can work in a democracy to subvert all of the values to which they give lip service. It worked brilliantly with the Roman Empire. Beliefs are overrated in Christianity. Religious traditions have to do with a lot more than beliefs.    Since the late 1970's and early 1980's, the Moral Majority and other "sin-management" based christian movements like Promise Keepers have hijacked religious rhetoric and have waged an all out campaign against the progressive members of their congregations. Culminating in the Republican Revolution of the 1990's, this war of words has significantly diminished the social justice emphasis of the message of Christ while elevating the counter-biblical "us versus them" mentality of the Religious Right. One left leaning christian author put it like this:    [Liberal Christianity] is one of those misleading words like "cult" which can be used simply as a term of insult by "conservatives" against those who do not sustain their literalistic interpretation of the Bible. . . . academically "liberal" Christianity is essentially an anti-dogmatic and humanitarian reconstruction of the Christian faith.     Last summer before the start of the Primary Season, Amy Sullivan in an article in the Washington Monthly entitled,  urlLink  “Do the Democrats Have a Prayer?”  , made the following observation:    I'm constantly amazed at how many progressives seem unaware that liberal Christianity did not die with Dr. King, or that a huge, decent middle ground exists...  ...While Bush may have almost a lock on conservative evangelicals, many moderate believers -- Catholics, Muslims, old mainstream church Protestants, and even suburban evangelicals -- are closer in their thinking to Democratic concerns. There are areas of difference -- particularly abortion -- and I don't want to suggest that's not important, but Democratic candidates inability to speak the language of faith, to use it to point out the areas of common ground, is a huge impediment...    What Sullivan, Pagels and others have observed is a growing disdain for liberal christians from both the right and the left. The Right's displeasure with progressive christianity is obvious. What is more difficult to understand, however, is how often unschooled left-wingers attempt to alienate the believers in their midst and relegate them to the margins. This is problematic because the source of most progressive policies throughout the Western world find their roots in thoughtful and justice-oriented biblical exegesis.   Moreover, as Sullivan astutely acknowledges, the Democratic Party, the party of the Left, has historically been a broad based coalition of inclusion-minded Americans:    Democrats are a coalition party when it comes to religion, much as they are when it comes to race, ethnicity, and class. Gore voters in 2000 were an amalgam of FDR Catholics, marginalized mainline Protestants, secularists, religious African Americans, Jews, some Muslims, and all other minority religious groups except Mormons. "Democrats worry about talking about religion in a way that endorses a particular faith or offends anyone," says one senior Democratic congressional aide. "So they've just decided not to talk about religion around other people, and that's hurting them." Nearly every Democrat I spoke to expressed concern that if Democrats focus on religion, they will alienate some portion of their base. But, in fact, 80 percent of Gore's support in 2000 came from religiously committed voters. While Democratic voters may distrust the religious right, they don't dislike religion itself.     Despite the foregoing observation, most unthinking liberals use the moniker "Christian" as an insult or an attempt to denigrate believers and control the terms of political debate through name-calling and baseless stereotyping. One writer notes:    how often he finds progressives using the word "Christian" as a short hand way to complain about and denigrate the policies of the Christian right. As he points out, a broad brush condemnation of Christians is off the mark and we should be much more careful about how we pick our words so we too can be closer to reality. The carelessness with our language has the potential to divide us when we cannot afford to be divided.    Taking this one step further, liberals who vehemently attack their religious counterparts are unwittingly participating in the Rove-Bush-Frist world view that divides the world into the polar opposites of good and evil or believers and infidels.   I am confident (and hopeful) that the bulk of the Hooligans are much deeper and more thoughful than most, but as a final note, please consider the observations of David Chandler, christian hooligan, in his article  urlLink  A Biblical Basis for Liberal Politics  :    The "Religious Right" (Moral Majority, Christian Coalition, etc.) gets so much media attention for its conservative political activism that a casual observer would think conservative Christianity somehow equates to conservative politics. This is not the case. In fact many people with left-leaning political views find a solid basis for their positions in the Bible. America is as much an economic phenomenon as it is a nation. It is built on a system whose driving force is the profit motive. Our economy blatantly rewards greed. In classic economic theory greed is good. A person who is motivated by greed will create, as unintended byproducts, benefits for everyone, such as employment and the development of new goods and services. Let the rich get richer, the saying goes, and the benefits will "trickle down" to the rest of us. "A rising tide raises all boats." Under a pure capitalistic system the government keeps hands off and allows the market to decide how the money flows. The problem is, as we have found in this era of deregulation, the money flows to the top. Tampering with the market system to redistribute the wealth or assure that the poor are protected is labeled "socialism." By these standards Jesus was a socialist. Jesus spoke remarkably often about wealth and poverty. To the poor he said, "Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of God," (Luke's version). To the rich he said, "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth," and "go, sell what you have, and give to the poor." When the rich turned away from him because they couldn't follow his command he observed, "it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." For Jesus, helping the poor and the outcast is not optional: it is the essence of what it means to love God.    [POSTSCRIPT: What appeals to this Hooligan about the christian mythos is the notion of forgiveness. This Hooligan understands that people, like himself, make mistakes, act unthoughfully, forget to acknowledge others, momentarily take paths of self-destruction, get caught up in the twin illusions of greed and vanity, mistake knowledge and wit for wisdom and promote selfishness. All those things can be forgotten. Perhaps this is why the Bush-Myth resonates with weaker-minded christians so powerfully. Bush was able to fashion himself as a born-again believer whose past was just that, past. What we forget about when we bash the other side is that even conservatives (and perhaps especially conservatives) are participants in the same dramatic cycle, mistakes-redemption-mistakes-redemption. Of course, if you've never made any mistakes or gone down the wrong road, or aren't aware enough to realize it, then maybe the notion of forgiveness just blows right past you, and I don't think any religion can speak to your condition. For the rest of us, at this crucial point in American political life, seeking middle ground, emphasizing our similarities rather than our differences, might be the course that will push BushCo out of office and result in the true spirit of hope, optimism, and national health, that the Two Johns so desperately want us to believe in.]

      The Swinging State of North Carolina by Chris Bowers   From a state that often does well in a certain other "dance," it is perhaps appropriate that the entire state is now a central focus of the biggest dance of all. In the 2004 election, North Carolina is officially a toss-up. In 2000, North Carolina had a partisan index of GOP +13.3, virtually identical to its partisan index of GOP +13.2 in 1996. However, as I wrote two months ago, well before Edwards was chosen as Vice-President, it was pretty clear that the state's partisan index would be far less favorable to the GOP in 2004. Here are all of the Bush vs. Kerry post-Super Tuesday trial heats from North Carolina:   Research 2000, 6/13-16, 600 LV, MoE 4 Bush	47 Kerry	42  Rasmussen, 6/1-6/30, 500 LV, MoE 4.5 (3/1-3/13 results in parenthesis) Bush	49 (51) Kerry	42 (43)  Mason-Dixon, 5/14-17, 625 "active" voters, MoE 4 Bush	48 Kerry	41  Bush / Cheney  46 Kerry / Edwards 45  Internal Democratic Poll, from the subscriber section of Polling Report, 3/30-4/1, 600 LV, MoE 4 Bush	51 Kerry	44  Since Super Tuesday, Bush has consistently held a lead of around six or seven points on Kerry in North Carolina. This is only half of what the partisan index indicated Bush should have been leading by in North Carolina if the race was tied nationally. The only poll conducted in the state that measured a Kerry / Edwards ticket vs. Bush / Cheney showed a dead heat. Further, below the trial heats and into the unfavorables, it was clear that Kerry had a real shot at North Carolina on his own:   Research 2000 Bush    37 Kerry   34  Mason-Dixon Bush    38 Kerry   36  Astoundingly, Kerry's unfavorables are actually slightly lower than Bush's in North Carolina, meaning that his universe of potential voters is actually slightly higher than Bush's--and that was before Edwards!. What have the three most recent Democratic VP's brought to their home state?        Partisan Swing in VP Home State Bentsen 	    DNC +4.4 Gore	    DNC +7.7 Lieberman	    DNC +7.4  Bentsen was from Texas, the same state the 1988 GOP Presidential nominee, Bush I, called home. Even then, he brought a 4.4 pro-DNC swing. If Edwards brings the same swing to North Carolina that Gore brought to TN and Lieberman brought to CT, then Bush's consistent six or seven point lead is completely erased.  Welcome to the dance, Tar Heels.

         Well friends, on June 23rd, we ran a little blog and this picture with the title "Rumors Abound."  This is no longer true, Kerry's email went out this morning, saying:  Dear Scrutiny Hooligans,   In just a few minutes, I will announce that Senator John Edwards will join me as my running-mate on the Democratic ticket as a candidate for vice president of the United States. Teresa and I could not be more excited that John and Elizabeth Edwards will be our partners in our journey to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.   You are the heart and soul of our campaign. You've shattered records and expectations every step of the way. Every time someone said you couldn't do it, you proved them wrong. Because of your incredible grassroots energy and commitment, I wanted to make the first official announcement of my decision to you -- more than one million online supporters at johnkerry.com.   I want you to know why I'm excited about running for president with John Edwards by my side. John understands and defends the values of America. He has shown courage and conviction as a champion for middle class Americans and those struggling to reach the middle class. In the Senate, he worked to reform our intelligence, to combat bioterrorism, and keep our military strong. John reaches across party lines and speaks to the heart of America -- hope and optimism. Throughout his own campaign for President, John spoke about the great divide in this country -- the "Two Americas" -- that exist between those who are doing well today and those that are struggling to make it from day to day. And I am so proud that we're going to build one America together.   In the next 120 days and in the administration that follows, John Edwards and I will be fighting for the America we love. We'll be fighting to give the middle class a voice by providing good paying jobs and affordable health care. We'll be fighting to make America energy independent. We'll be fighting to build a strong military and lead strong alliances, so young Americans are never put in harm's way because we insisted on going it alone.   I can't tell you how proud I am to have John Edwards on my team, or how eager I am for the day this fall when he stands up for our vision and goes toe-to-toe with Dick Cheney.   This is the most important election of our lifetime, and a defining moment in our history. With you by our side every day of this campaign, John and I will lead the most spirited presidential campaign America has ever seen and fight to lead our nation in a new and better direction.   Thank you,   John Kerry   P.S. Love your site!

      Well, there was Hadrian's wall built by the Romans to keep the barbarians out (and we know how well that worked), then there were the walls of Jericho (felled by trumpets), Troy (made inept by wooden horse), and Babylon (and I think we just finished bombing what remained of them during GulfWar I and II).   AND THEN, OF COURSE WE HAVE...  -The Great Wall of China-      Emperor Qin Shihuang succeeded in his effort to have the walls joined together to fend off the invasions from the Huns in the north after the unification of China -  Failed, the Khans rocked em! .  -The Berlin Wall-      In the afternoon of August 12 at 4 p.m. Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader, signed the commands to close the border. Next Sunday at midnight the army, police and the "Kampfgruppen" began to bolt the city. The wall is built and separates the city into two parts for more than 28 years.Streets, the railway and the S-Bahn are broken, stations of the U-Bahn are closed, even cemeteries are not spared.  Torned down in 1989 by some pissed Berliners! .  -The Belfast Wall-      The Peace Wall is Belfast's most chilling sight. The first one went up through the center of Belfast in the early 1970s. By 1994 there were 15 of them, snaking in and out of housing estates, slicing through back gardens, dividing neighbor from neighbor and interfering with the residents' access to the local newspaper or grocery store. For Belfast's walls are only the outward, physical manifestation of the fears and the rage that have kept this internecine conflict going.  Failed to keep the peace!   -The US/Mexico Border Wall-      Created at first to keep diseased cattle out of Texas, its now used to keep immigrants out of the United States.  Failed!   and the newest addition to the world's walls of failure...  -The Israel "Security Barrier" Wall-              Israel's Separation Barrier, dubbed the "Apartheid Wall" or "Berlin Wall" by Palestinians, has increasingly attracted international media attention, largely due to the hard-to-ignore scale of the project. Israel is going to ignore the  urlLink WORLD COURT RULING .  Security Barrier? Fence? Separation Barrier? Looks like a  urlLink WALL  to me!

Their Vice-Presidential Candidate, Pat LaMarche, reports "that her top priority is not winning the White House for her party, but ensuring that President Bush is defeated. She is, in fact, so determined to see Bush lose that she would not commit to voting for herself and her running mate, Texas lawyer David Cobb."  No, the Hooligans will not be making any Kerry running mate predictions, though you may hear some hooligans mutter frustratedly if anyone mentions McCain, Clinton, or Gephardt.  There's plenty more important Kerry news out there right now anyway...  "A Catholic lawyer has filed heresy charges against Sen. John Kerry with the Archdiocese of Boston, accusing the Democratic presidential candidate of bringing "most serious scandal to the American public" by receiving Holy Communion as a pro-choice Catholic..."  Kos has the story  urlLink HERE .  If you can get to California by Tuesday,  urlLink this will be a fun-filled, no holds barred affair , to be sure.

         Scrutiny Hooligans celebrate our Independence by reading, and urging you to read, the Declaration penned in 1776.  As you read it, think not only of the idealistic birth of our great nation, but also think of the way we have handled Iraq...   IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776 The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America   When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. --That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. --Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.  To continue reading  urlLink CLICK HERE .

I mean literally, that's a quote. When I said to him, “It's a nuanced situation, Mr. President.” He said, “I don't do nuance, Mr. Chairman."  Biden talks about global security from Kosovo to Iraq in  urlLink this thoughtful interview .  "TIGER HAND! RAWR!!!!! RAWRR! rar. Hahaaa, hi. Tiger Hand. Come on! You Know! ...

In the continuing exploration of Iraqi " urlLink Sovereignty " and mind-bending irony, the U.S. military " urlLink raided a building belonging to the Iraqi ministry of the interior where prisoners were allegedly being physically abused by Iraqi interrogators ."  Former Halliburton auditor, Marie DeYoung, " urlLink repeatedly complained to superiors  of waste and fraud.

Eddie Johnson (D-FL) has, along with eight other congressmen,  urlLink begun an effort  to have the U.N. monitor the 2004 U.S. elections.  Deaniacs who are standing fast to their Howard Powered values have a  urlLink convention power play  in mind.  No word as to what Gov. Dean thinks of this.  The  urlLink Presidential Prayer Team , organized by  urlLink The Envoy Group , is working hard to use the power of prayer to aid our Christian nation and its Christian officials in doing God's work.

Working perversely to reinforce each other's ideological excesses, they have managed to drown out mainstream voices from all sides.

         The Scrutiny Hooligans again celebrate Embrace the Face Friday by reminding you that, though he's got a face as long as the California coastline, John F. Kerry holds the keys to our future.  Today, and each Friday until election day, the Scrutiny Hooligans will talk about selected issues and where JFK stands.  Today:  Kerry's Energy Plan.  Kerry ends the paleolithic environment vs. jobs and clean energy vs. affordable energy arguments by offering a plan that promises to create 500,000 new jobs as part of his energy policy while investing in clean technologies, so energy producers can continue to make energy inexpensive while journeying towards greener sources and methods.  How?  1.  Creating an Energy Security and Conservation Trust "dedicated to accelerating the commercialization of technologies -- such as the manufacture of more efficient cars and trucks, the development of biofuels, and the creation of a hydrogen-based energy economy [by 2020!]-- that will reduce America’s dangerous dependence on oil."  2.  Reducing oil consumption by increasing fuel economy standards to 36 mpg by 2015 while incentivizing corporations to build environmentally friendlier vehicles.  3.  A Plan to use Hydrogen across the nation by 2020 while also prioritizing conservation and alternative energies.  Under the Kerry energy plan, 20% of the nation's energy will come from renewable sources by 2020.  Kerry also relies heavily on the expansion of natural gas energy.  4.  Ending unnecessary tax breaks for Enrons and Exxons.  5.  Investing in clean coal technologies and helping coal burning power plants convert.  Kerry suggests that America coal riches should not be dismissed as environmentally irresponsible while technologies exist to capitalize on coal and minimize environmental harm.  You can read it for yourself  urlLink HERE .  Kerry takes the shallow Republican rallying cry to end our dependence on foreign oil to its logical conclusion:  End America's dependence on oil for energy.  The amount of oil produced in this country will continue to be necessary in creating plastics and other materials (see uptown ruler's  urlLink Peak Oil post  for more on this), but Kerry recognizes the absurdity of poisoning our environment and our foreign relations by depending on oil as our central energy source.    Americans are going to continue to demand and consume more energy than any nation on the planet, but Kerry aims to reduce consumption and offer safer alternatives that will fuel our nation, its economy, its employment, and its health.  Above all, Kerry asserts that movement away from oil dependence is a central national security issue ignored by the Bush administration's short-sighted plan to open ANWR to drilling.  This may be old hat to many hooligans out there, but many people have not made the energy independence/national security connection.  Help them.  In Kerry's own words (read the entire speech  urlLink HERE ): " we need to reach as high as Roosevelt reached - with a new national initiative on the scale of the Manhattan Project to harness our thinking and our technology - this time, not to create a new kind of bomb, but to develop new forms of energy that will at long last make America more energy independent. So I have come here today to set out a strategy for greater energy independence - so that within a decade, this nation will no longer have to rely on Mideast oil. And in achieving that new form of freedom for America, we can at the same time clean the environment and create new jobs for half a million Americans."   " George Bush persists in pursuing a course that can only be described as energy dependence - an approach, that despite all his boasts about a stronger America, will actually risk our hopes, make us weaker, and make both our economy and our country more vulnerable to blackmail by hostile powers ."  " There is a better way. We have the opportunity and potential to create an oil-free future. Once the idea of creating clean, renewable sources of energy right here in America was dismissed as science fiction. Today, it is potentially right around the corner - and, more often than not, the technology is already here ."   " With common-sense investments in advancing and speeding breakthroughs, we can literally, on large scale, for the first time in human history, harness the natural world around us to light and power the world we live in; the sun, the wind, water, and a rich array of crops can provide us with secure forms of energy at reasonable costs for a modern 21st century economy."   " We can use new technologies and innovations to recast existing sources of energy - like oil, coal, and natural gas - and use them more cleanly and efficiently."   " And by seizing the amazing opportunities presented to us by American agriculture, it will ensure that the renewable fuel content of gasoline will grow to five billion gallons in the next decade. That's good for America and American farmers."   " We can do all this while creating jobs - not losing them. And while preserving and not subverting the environment for this and future generations. The threat from greenhouse gases and global warming is real and we have to confront it head on."   " In sum, setting a national goal of ending our reliance on Middle East oil within this next decade is critical to the long-term national security of the United States. No foreign government can embargo clean, domestic, renewable sources of energy -- and no terrorist can seize control of them ."  Go Get 'Em Johnny.

           Long before the immoral and unjustifiable war was prosecuted against the innocent children of Iraq, one Bishop of the Episcopal Church in America did more than simply rant about, and oppose, the disastrous implications of unilateral military engagement.  He used his pulpit to warn his congregants about the perilious and, dare I say, demonic path chosen by the President, the Congress, John Kerry and nearly 70% of the American people.        Now, just months away from an election that, by all accounts, will mirror the 2000 election morass, the Right Rev. Bennett J. Sims, once a US Naval officer in WWII, former Bishop of the Diocese of Atlanta, and Founding President of the Institute for Servant Leadership, has released a thoughtful, intellectually sound and spiritually guided book condemning the Bush Administration for betraying our democratic values and usurping orthodox rhetoric to cynically transform the language of peace into the bark of war.  In "Why Bush Must Go: A Bishop's Faith-Based Challenge," the Right Reverend patiently and persistently contends that "the political leadership of [his] country has become a menace to the longevity of the human and environmental odysseys by several reckless moves:          1.  unilateral warmaking in a time that calls for international peace-seeking collaboration,       2.  lavishly heightened investment in the military,       3.  consequent impoverishment of education and health care for American citizens,       4.  scorn of environmental constraints and global treaties,       5.  preferential economic treatment for the wealthy and select corporations, and       6.  the beginning erosion of constitutional guarantees of citizen freedom."  [NOTE:  As Bishop Sims was penning the first draft of his treatise against the current Administration during the Democratic primary season, he had hopes for the Left's ability to counteract the aforementioned six (6) reckless moves.  Perhaps the Bishop became less optimistic about our collective desire to right those wrongs when the Democratic Party chose as its presumptive nominee a candidate who, if his voting record is any indication, would have recklessly made moves 3, 5, and 6, by voting for the ill-advised, teacher-attacking "No Child Left Behind Act," the Bush Tax Cut, and the so-called Patriot Act (but, I guess, in our American 'lesser of the evils' duopoly, 3 out of 6 is the best we're going to get).]       For those readers who feel that spiritually minded people should stay home and watch FoxNews, Bishop Sims wants you to consider the following:       "It will be objected to that I am mixing religion and politics.  But of course.  This mixture has always been the implicit ground of all political action, and it is in high public fashion now.  We need only ask the present incumbent of the Oval Office about his blend of politics and religion.  He has said that God has called him to be president of the United States.  And he is so confident of divine appointment as to hold in scorn the bulk of American and world religious leadership, including Pope John Paul II and the Dalai Lama, when he refused, without apology, to listen to their ardent opposition to the military invasion of Iraq."       Such statements probably won't register much with those of hardened hearts who spin any reference to Jesus as a call to fundamentalist arms.  But the Bishop speaks to that as well.  Those intellectual light-weights are, unbeknownst to themselves, swept up into a conceptual problem and are simply incapable of thinking outside of the dominant religion-suspicious secular paradigm.  According to Rev. Sims,       "the conceptual problem is that there are two antithetical power motifs in the religions of the world:  the conventional dominator drive and the visionary collaborative ideal.  The first version carries the name fundamentalism.  It is locked into an old and ebbing form of human consciousness that urges the use of violence to avenge violence [NOTE:  even Catchy believes, as most Americans, there is, to paraphrase, "a time for kicking a little ass]. . .  By contrast, at the heart of all the world's religions there is a voice that knows counterviolence to be counterproductive.  In the first version there is a strain of eager attachment to things as they are, along with the impulse to obey unquestioningly the constituted authorities, including punitive and jealous deities of wrath.  But this is not the evolving heart of the great religions . . . Fundamentalist religion [NOTE:  which Hoolie seems to believe all christians adhere to]is cast in the ancient male-dominant tradition and is preoccupied with an imminent and violent end of the world. [NOTE:  This belief is, no doubt, what prompted Bush to answer when asked how he believed history would judge him, "I don't know we'll all be dead."]       Without giving away the ending, the Bush-bashing Bishop builds his argument against the imperialist-fundamentalist quest for cultural and political domination to a clanging crescendo of hope:       "Given these realities [NOTE: candidates who either campaign on a platform of war or flip-floppingly stand by and watch it happen], how can the human future be anything but foreclosed in an apocalyptic nuclear calamity?  Still I am hopeful.  God is not mocked.  My better sense is that a global calamity is only a 'short-run' forecast of despair.  Beneath the surface of the presently popular 'cowboy strut' of American flag waving there moves a rising tide of conflict resolution by the wisdom of nonviolence, a world-preserving use of power in 'relationships of equality.' Quiet evidence abounds that humanity is on an incipient spiritual move upward, up from the lower conception of power as unilateral privilege to the more mature conception of power as relational equality."      There are those who would say, "I don't need christianity or buddhism or hinduism or taoism or judaism, etc., to advocate for peace."  To them, I gently bow, smile, depart and continue down an evolving journey leaving anger, bitterness, narrowness, and conformity behind in my ever-widening wake.      Bishop Sims' book is currently available at www.continuumbooks.com.      Peace.

        Clyde Fargus, a citizen of Hillsbrook, N.C., has claimed to witness the return of recently deceased president Ronald Reagan. Tens of people have gathered from all over Hillsbrook to pay homage to the face of Ronald Reagan which has miraculously appeared on a burnt piece of toast. It has not been verified but the toast is apparently Wheat, though White Toast could not be discounted.  “He hath returneth..ed,” said Clyde Fargus . “I knew he would. Let he who not believeth looketh at thine toast of which has burnt.”   “I was just about to spread some jam on it when I looked down and there he was. The Gipper looking up at me. Then I heard the message.  Spread the word  the toast said to me,  Do not eateth me, for I shall return. Spread thy message… God Hates Democrats… Vote Bush 2004…   “I was flabbergasted. I thought everyone knew God hated democrats. But now he’s sent a holy messenger.”   Fargus isn’t sure why he was chosen as the recipient of Reagan’s visit but believes it was because he is a solid American, a good Christian and has a tattoo of a bald eagle on his chest.  Fargus hasn’t determined what he is going to do with the Reagan Toast but he feels it is his American duty to let people bask in “the glory that is Reagan.”   “I think it’s important for everyone to see that he hath died but now he has returnedethed. Praise Reagan! Cometh and beholdeth thine toast… for a modest fee of course."  Fargus also claims the Reagan Toast has healing powers. “I seen a Democrat come in here and touch it… and it healed him.  He left a born-again Republican. Praise Reagan!”  The Toast will be on display at Fargus’ house from noon to 5:00 p.m. every day. Come anytime, but don’t wake the baby.

Media Matters has  urlLink the skinny .  Jesus' General  urlLink points out another work in progress  on the part of right-wing Christians - this one to assure that homophobia can be preached from every pulpit in the land.  Wonkette  urlLink makes us love her :  "Yo, Middle East -- You've Been Iraq'd!  Please, don't get us wrong, we totally heart sovereignty. It's, like self-rule and shit. But as a gag gift, it's sort of overwhelming. What is this, The Kutcher Doctrine?"   Iraqi sovereignty continues as  urlLink the newest face man  for the U.S. military in Iraq reveals to Peter Jennings that American troops will not seek permission for operations.  General Ricardo "Dirty" Sanchez, famous for being the head bagman at Abu Ghraib, departed to parts unreported.    Wait a minute...Wait one cottonpickin' minute...If George W. is the choice of Jesus, and George W. Bush lies every time he uses  urlLink the word sovereign  to describe Iraq, does that mean Jesus likes liars?  I'm having some hardcore cognitive dissonance over here.  Newsday.com  urlLink questions Bush's credibility .  While George and Jesus sort things out, John Kerry will be counting  urlLink his mad mammon .  No one expected him to raise half of this, but he's gone and raised over $175 million, most of it in donations around $100.  This is Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Average stepping up and doing something about the irredeemable BushCo.  GWB, of course, has raised more than this, but he's squandered a good bit of it trying to tar his Catholic opponent as a waffling, flip-flopping, pessimistic opportunist.  But George...What about  urlLink YOUR flip-flopping?   What about  urlLink YOUR pessimism?  What about your... oh I could go on and on, but I'll let GWB take it up with his Maker.  Scroll down for news about  urlLink the DRAFT .  Uptown Ruler helps you understand that it's already happening.   urlLink Saddam is on trial .  He says it's theater.  He says that George W. Bush ought to be on trial.  Well, Mr. Hussein, we agree with you.  But that doesn't mean your psychopathic ass shouldn't get locked into the dungeons of Abu Ghraib.  We'd just like GW to have to mud  urlLink wrestle you  first.  Lastly, a  urlLink fascinating find in the Utah desert  helps us know the history of our land, and the rancher who has hidden the secret ruins for almost fifty years is a cool cucumber himself.

      I've been waiting for this, so here it is. Some websites created to attack Michael Moore.     Moore Watch    and one on our own happy blog server    urlLink fahrenheit_fact.blogspot.com    I have to admit. I love it. We've been bombarded by conservative radio, books and talk shows with their lies, half-truths and out-of-context quotes for years. Now it's the "liberal's" turn. You can feel the frustration and anger oozing between the lines of these blogs.   All I want to say to the seething conservatives is HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Beeyatch!

      Consider the following:  The World Council of Churches issued this  urlLink  statement   condemning the war in Iraq.  The World Alliance of Reformed Churches called the war in Irq immoral, illegal, and "to use a traditional word, it is a  urlLink  sin  .  The World Methodist Council called for an immediate end to all  urlLink  hostilities   against Iraq.  (state side)The National Council of Churches, in an effort to use christic metaphors and analogies to draw open minded believers into the path of peace, drafted the following Beattitudes of Peacemaking, quoted here in their entirety:  Create SHOCK and AWE by showing LOVE and JUSTICE.  Cancel the malpractice insurance for SPIN DOCTORS.  Capitalize the word NON-VIOLENCE.  Study the PEACE TACTICS of Jesus and Mohammed, King and Gandhi.  Beware of those who read the SCRIPTURES and find God to be a war-maker, not a peacemaker.  Warn that the end time could come prematurely if HUMANS put their fingers on the wrong buttons.  Declare the real AXIS OF EVIL to be: The pandemic of poverty The environmental degradation of planet earth  And the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  Eat, drink and breathe PEACE. LOVE passionately both neighbors and enemies. Be slivers of HOPE. Always remember, “In a dark time the eye begins to see.”  Understand that the present crisis is more about AMERICAN POLICY than Iraq.  Envision real change in human history that requires a mutation of heart and mind. We need spiritual and intellectual MUTANTS to lead us.   More, from those damned peace loving members of the United Church of  urlLink  Christ  .  Oh, yeah, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America,  urlLink  too  .  Read here a  urlLink  Confession of Complicity   in response to the war in Iraq issued by the Council of the Orthodox Peace Fellowship in North America.  Even those Jesus-loving, simple minded  urlLink  Presbyterians   condemn the use of torture in Iraq, and unlike the presumed Democratic presidential nominee  urlLink  opposed   the war before it started.  But because Southern Baptists speak for all christians, foreign and domestic, I guess those  urlLink  knee-jerks   are right because if Bush and the Baptists believe the war is biblically justified then, by god, it must be so.

         What is this new plan all about???  1) Move troops from Europe and South Korea to future war zone... 2) To hell with those old europeans and to hell with the slants too... 3) I really want to look like I have a plan, so I'm going to move a bunch of guys around... 4) Iraq?  Who's that?  What?   5) Bring Home The Troops! Just not the ones being shot at... 6) Kim Jong Who? 7) We're gonna need these troops to quell the uprising when BC'04 get to stealing their next election... 8) No more headlines for you Mr. Kerry.  well...here's the dealio as reported by Australia's  urlLink The Age , "The United States is expected to announce that it is pulling 100,000 troops out of Europe and Asia, the Financial Times newspaper reports.  It said the withdrawals - the largest restructuring of Washington's military presence abroad since World War II - would be announced in a speech by US President George W Bush.  Citing "people briefed on the plan" in a front-page story datelined London, the newspaper said two-thirds of the reductions would be in Europe, with 70,000 troops- mostly from Germany - being sent back to stateside bases.  "In Asia, the drawdown is expected to include the 3,500 soldier brigade from South Korea, recently deployed in Iraq, but will also include scaling down presences in several other countries in the region," it said.  Germany will still host the largest contingent of US troops in Europe, but the pullouts could nevertheless see the departure of the 1st Armoured Division and the 1st Infantry Division, the Financial Times said."  What say the Hooligans?

        When economic analysts make forecasts about future economic conditions, they rely on assumptions about variables - interest rates, tax revenue, et cetera.   urlLink Jerome over at MyDD  went and took a look around at nine different financial organizations' assumptions regarding the price of oil per barrel in Fiscal Year 2005.    Goldman Sachs: $35  Raymond James: $34  AG Edwards: $32  Merrill Lynch: $32  Lehman Brothers: $30  Smith Barney: $28  UBS: $28  CSFB: $27  Bear Stearns: $30   Today's actual price of oil:   urlLink $45.90 per barrel.   Beware rosy economic forecasts, people.  And aren't these magnates getting paid the big bucks to be right?  Who wants to predict when prices will plateau?

        Luis Gillardo's debut post at  urlLink LivinginLatinAmerica.com  (check waaaay down the sidebar to see ScruHoo's international blog links) makes me want to hop on a plane and fly to old San Juan.  Thanks Luis for permission to republish this in full.   A national health plan, massive public works, and increased welfare and food-stamp benefits. It sounds like the platform of the infamous Latin American leftist party, right? The platform belongs to the Partido Nuevo Progresista (PNP) which, believe it or not, is the most conservative of Puerto Rico's three main political parties. Puerto Rico is a rightist's worst nightmare; not one single center-right wing candidate is running for Governor.  The Presidents of Puerto Rico's two largest parties, the PNP and the Partido Popular Democratica (PPD) are both members of the United States Democratic Party. The President of the smaller third party, the Partido Independentista Puertorriqueña (PIP) was until shortly President of the Socialist International. The only notable right-wing candidate in the upcoming November elections is a young PNP businessman by the name of Luis Fortuño. Ironically he promises an increase in federal funds for local social programs. When asked about the contradiction between his conservatism and his petitions to increase social spending he responded with, "it's an issue of civil rights."  Unlike the political parties of Latin America, Puerto Rico's political arena is not shaped by debates between the left and the right but by differences on status. The PNP supports statehood for Puerto Rico, the PIP push for independence, and the PPD either push for autonomy or a continuation of the Commonwealth status. All three parties might have an occasional rightist within their ranks but the leadership and the party masses are staunch leftists. The PNP, at first a party ran by conservative elites, failed to gain a leading position in Puerto Rico's elections until it began incorporating liberal and leftist policies into its election platforms.  We've all heard the stereotypes of the Latin American's leftist tendencies. Some argue that the only reason that leftist parties haven't completely swept over the entire continent is due to the tainted image that guerrillas, coup plotters, and dictators have given the continent's left. When debate between left and right is non-existent in the political sphere, then the populace's true colors shall be shown.

      This crazy, republican, out-of-touch-with-the-whole-world bureaucratic crap has got to go. Anyway, I digress.... (steps on soap box)  But my real reason for posting is because I'm tired of hearing and seeing my friends and other good people carted off to jail for inoffensive and uncriminal crimes under this umbrella of "the war on drugs" and I want to bring to light how this problem came about, so we know how to prevent a similar problem from occurring in the future.  I'm a musician and recently while I was playing a festival out in the country with an attendance of about 3000, I saw some 'ole school 60's police harassment of the festival goers. North Carolina has a Department of Alcohol Law Enforcement. This law enforcement agency has the widest jurisdiction of any state enforcement agency. If there is a alcohol permit for a property, then they have carte blanche to search and police the entire premises with no probable cause and no warrant. This type of police power doesn't exist for any other state agency. Scary. Well at any rate, the NC ALE though that a few thousand hippies out in the middle of nowhere smoking weed and jamming out to Burning Spear were obviously up to no good and sent officers to go solve the problem. Well they came, they saw, they busted 7 percent of the festival's population (200 people) for anything from smoking a joint to having a pipe in their possession to underage drinking. (At this festival, no beer was sold so they got it from other festival folks) ALE sent 20+ agents to "handle the problem." Mind you this is a agency that employs around a hundred people. So, that's probably about a third to half of the agents in the state. Needless to say, people were getting harassed and arrested all over the place. A band's production manager was arrested for an alcohol offense. The stage manager was arrested for refusing to allow the agents to enter the dressing rooms and the production area (a very dangerous area.) A beer truck driver from Sweetwater brewery was arrested for some permit violation based on an antiquated boot-legging law. Then after the festival, a few cocky cowboy cops decided to start posting on the forums of the festival web site to annoy and basically be belligerent.  urlLink Check it out here.  Now a festival who just celebrated its 10th anniversary is gonna have to move out of state or just end. And 200 people have to pay thousands of dollars in fines and figure out where all their stuff and their car is, how to get back to it, and how to get home. If they even drove.  This is all under the decade old "war on drugs" blanket that has sent many a hippie and bohemian up the river. Why do they do this? Well lets put into an American perspective. We live in a country with such a political tide (or ripcurrent) that in the 1920's we actually AMENDED THE CONSTITUTION to ban alcohol forever. FOREVER!! This is alcohol... its BEEN AROUND FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. Its part of mankind. Like bread, fire, politics, money, property ownership. To disallow alcohol would be as inconceivable as prohibiting dancing. But we did it anyway. Alcohol, marijuana, sex, caffeine, psilocybin, peyote, mescaline, these are all mind/mood altering things that have always been here. We've always used them. How ignorant we were (and still are) to think that we can take ANY thousand+ year old ritual such as drinking and just abolish it with the bang of a gavel. Oh, we have a lot to learn. Believe this.... after a while, our purely reactionary government will finally come around like it did 10 plus years after the establishment of prohibition (when they had to pass ANOTHER amendment to fix what they had so seriously screwed up.) And when it does, simple uncriminal drugs such as marijuana and mushrooms will be treated as alcohol is and policed as such. And rightly so. Don't get this funky hooligan wrong, he don't want drugs legalized. Cause most drugs are bad... mmmkay. No doubt about that. He wants the simple natural drugs decriminalized and eventually legalized with proper policing. I'm tired of seeing my friends going through hell and being robbed of property and money because their out of touch government is not attentive enough to realize the travesty of the situation. It's a civil rights issue as far as I'm concerned. If we need to outlaw plants, why don't we start with  urlLink Hemlock ? If a child even blows through the flutes of a poison Hemlock plant (cause they look cool and they're kids), he could die. But nobody ever got locked up for growing hemlock in America. And it WILL KILL YOU.   . Here is the crux of my post. This is a problem, and we need to keep things like this from happening again. Here is how it happened. The de-legalization of marijuana was based on an anti-immigration movement in the 20's. The western states were complaining so loudly about "those damn Mexicans comin' up and ruining everything" that they persuaded Harry Anslinger, the Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics from 1930-62 (a relatively powerless bureaucrat at the time) to spearhead a movement to have it outlawed. This was so unorthodox that they had to invent a method to make it illegal. You see fellow patriots, this kind of thing was never considered when the constitution was written. So it wasn't constitutional. And you can interpret that however you please. Its obvious to this hooligan that we tossed that old pile of rags out the window right around the time of the civil war. More on that another time. So, how are the Feds gonna make the "Mexican problem" go away? Make it uncomfortable for them. Disallow their culture. But we can't outlaw a plant, it's never been done, how do we do that? Answer:  taxes . It worked like this. In 1900 2-5 percent of the adult population was addicted to opium. A BAD drug. We even fought wars over it. This stuff is bad. Got to get rid of it. Figured out that we can tax the hell out of it for civilian use so the tax is prohibitive. But doctors who are prescribing it pay only a minor tax. Make sense? (don't forget, taxes were one of the catalysts of our American revolution) So in 1914, the Harrison tax act passed and now the government can use taxes to make laws. Sounds like a loophole if I ever heard of one. Well that's how it was done. In 1937 because of "the Mexican problem" the " urlLink Marijuana Tax Stamp  Act" passed. It said you had to pay taxes on your stuff to get a stamp and be legal. Catch is that they weren't gonna issue any stamps. Just a few. And if you could get one, you had to have the stuff in hand when applying. And if you had the stuff in hand and no stamp yet, you already broke the law. Wow. How's that for a load of crap? This is the same way machine guns were made illegal by the way.  My friends it's this type of thing that can and is happening under out noses right now. We have to be attentive, else we wind up with another problem like this in a few years. And with our government, it could once again be 50 or 60 years before we can fix it. Keep your eyes open and your finger over the ballot as often as possible.  For further reading...   urlLink http://smokedot.org/story/2001/7/2/35918/10894   I apologize for the long post.  Make sure to check back soon for the new mix on hooligan radio to your right. Come September, I'll present to you Funk-O-Meters' "Sad Bastards Vol.1". Oh I can't wait.

        Pulling a nationwide average hovering between 2% and 4%, failing to get on the ballot in some states while succeeding in others, and constantly having to defend himself against Spoiler charges, Ralph Nader continues to enthrall greens, liberals, libertarians, and, if you pay attention to who's been helping Nader2004 get into the race, Republicans.    This Hooligan believes that Ralph Nader is not only increasing the risk of a second Bush term but is also marginalizing those issues he intends to bring to the mainstream.  Here are some of the issues at the forefront of Mr. Nader's agenda: - Stop Illegal Iraqi Occupation:  get peace with justice by accelerating true Iraqi sovereignty. - Fight Corporate Crime and Abuse:  exact personal responsibility from all corporate wrongdoers. - Reform the failed Justice and Prison System:  savings should go to education. - Repeal Patroit Act: restore civil liberties that give you a say. - Implement Universal Health Care:  the U.S. is still the only western democracy without it.  urlLink Read the Rest Here (pdf)   I love these ideas.  I could get behind these ideas.  I want my government to act on these ideas.  Hm.  Why isn't anyone talking about these ideas?  Because Ralph Nader is.  The Anybody But Bush sentiment driving the rise of our hardly flawless hero, John F. Kerry, does not suffer Nader lightly.  Ralph's  urlLink unfavorable ratings  are stratospheric in latest polls.  Though I dispute the notion of Nader as spoiler, I acknowledge that most dems do not.  An electorate this divided forces the Kerry campaign to fight on two fronts (1) Win Swing Voters; (2) Mobilize the base in numbers to match the Jeebus W. Bush crowd. If Kerry does both, he wins.  Neither, and he loses.     Kerry would like to talk more about corporate responsibility and environmental issues, but he can not afford to be branded "as liberal as Nader".  This brand drives Kerry's coveted swing voters into apathy or into the Bush camp, and the resulting pickup from the Nader camp is too small to make up for the loss.  Nader, in his well-intentioned efforts to raise awareness for his agenda, is making it impossible for Kerry to publicly support any of them.  If Nader hadn't claimed the ideas and staked his campaign on them, then Kerry might better be able to package them into his campaign as centrist.  Ralph.  Get out of the race.  Sit still in your apartment until after November 2.  Organize, organize, organize.  Be the messenger for these issues, but not until after Bush, the first obstacle to progress, is removed from office.  Your presence practically ensures that none of the issues you intend to bolster will be taken seriously.  Your 3% in the polls instantly qualifies your agenda as fringe and unsupported.  Again, I believe Ralph Nader means well.  I don't believe his presence in the race will make or break Kerry.  I support a great deal of the Nader agenda and his vision of a better America.  However, John Kerry, the only candidate in the race with a chance to unseat Bush, will not be able to mobilize his supporters around causes dear to Naderites until Ralph himself makes a curtain call.

        That's a quote from Bob Woodward, assistant managing editor of the Washington Post.   urlLink The Post came out today with its version  of the NYT's "Mistakes were made" article regarding the spinelessness and lack of integrity demonstrated by the mainstream press in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq.  Choice quotes:  "The Post published a number of pieces challenging the White House, but rarely on the front page."   Translation:   The Post agreed with the administration before walking away and mumbling 'stupidheads' under its breath.   "The result was coverage that, despite flashes of groundbreaking reporting, in hindsight looks strikingly one-sided at times."   Translation:  Despite occasionally mentioning the truth, we did a helluva job of making the war look inevitable.   "Across the country, "the voices raising questions about the war were lonely ones," [Executive Editor] Downie said. "We didn't pay enough attention to the minority."    Translation:  The multiplicity of protests by individuals, groups, city governments, watchdog groups, international organizations just seemed lonely when measured against the lack of verifiable information being spoon-fed to me by Rummy.    "Woodward, for his part, said it was risky for journalists to write anything that might look silly if weapons were ultimately found in Iraq. "   Translation:  Reporting the facts was risky because, one day, new facts might arise.   "skeptical stories usually triggered hate mail "questioning your patriotism and suggesting that you somehow be delivered into the hands of the terrorists."    Translation:  We caved to the Freepi.   "If there's something I would do differently -- and it's always easy in hindsight -- the top of the story would say, 'We're going to war, we're going to war against evil.' But later down it would say, 'But some people are questioning it.' The caution and the questioning was buried underneath the drumbeat. . . . The hugeness of the war preparation story tended to drown out a lot of that stuff."    Translation:  We're still going to pretend that we did almost the right thing in our reportage.   "He said the inability of dissenters "to speak up with their names" was a factor in some of his news judgments."   Translation:  Unnamed sources from inside the Whitehouse or the CIA are no problem, but unnamed sources with facts?  Oh Hell No.   "The sources [regarding claims that Al Qaeda got nerve gas from Saddam] were not promoting the war. . . . One of them was actually against it," he said. "They were career security officials, not political officials. They were, however, wrong." Gellman added that "it was news even though it was clear that it was possible this report would turn out to be false."    Translation:  We'll print some crazy as hell, unverifiable nonsense.   This story just goes on and on, folks.  Four online pages worth.  I read it all and here's the translation:   We didn't report the facts.  We reported whatever the administration told us because we were afraid not to.  Mistakes were made, but we're not sorry.  Don't expect any changes in the future.  Now STFU you whiny libs.

        Remember, back last week, when the Florida Republican Party urged its members to request their absentee ballots because touch screen voting machines can't be trusted to accurately record votes or leave a paper trail?  Well, that was a "misunderstanding".  "Have no doubt that we are confident of Florida's elections system, and that means the entire electoral system is accurate and secure,"  urlLink said Joseph Agostini, spokesman for the Florida Republican Party . "We regret any misunderstanding over this issue."  There was no misunderstanding, Joe.  You spoke the truth, then you got bullied by Jeb Bush and his Republican goons, then you got your scared ass on TV and commenced to lie, lie, lie.    While we're on the subject of Florida Republicans - Ed Heeney is running for the Florida state legislature on the Republican issues of  urlLink gay bashing and homophobia , "In remarks reported in this column on May 15, the Republican state representative candidate said he was "homo-nausic" and warned that Palm Beach County residents should be wary of gays and lesbians moving north from Broward. I've had enough of their influence on our culture and society," Heeney said. "I have no personal difficulty with them. I just know they're not to be underestimated. They're very, very militant." One concern: A phenomenon he detected in which "the lesbian community" in Fort Lauderdale was buying restaurants and bars, making it difficult for non-gays to shoot pool."  I'm just guessing here, but is this guy a Bush supporter or what?  The newest member of the Republican party is Louisiana Congressman Rodney Alexander, who switched parties just before the end of the filing deadline, thus ensuring no real competition for his seat.  Unfortunately for this defective man, he's broken campaign laws and now may not be eligible to run at all.  "Alexander's SECOND filing 20 minutes before the deadline is in effect a withdrawal of his candidacy under Louisiana law since candidates are prohibited from amending their ballot qualification in any way once it has been made."  urlLink Atrios  gives the legal points, and  urlLink Jerome at MyDD  fills in all the stupid stuff that Alexander has said since jumping ship (e.g. "he picked up “some strong vibrations” that he was losing support among liberals in the 5th District’s Democratic base. “I didn’t want to engage in a campaign where I was defending myself on those issues at every turn,” he said. “So I just decided that I’d switch and run as a Republican.”)

          urlLink Patsy Keever  has been campaigning hard for nearly a year for Western North Carolina's 11th Congressional District.  Her central campaign issues of health care, jobs, education, and the environment have been turning the heads of this constituency long dominated by the slash and burn politics of 14-year incumbent Charles Taylor.  Keever's career of schoolteaching, county commission, and congressional candidate has sculpted a candidate with impeccable ethics, unassailable values, and a network of support three generations deep.  The latest good news came in today as Howard Dean's  urlLink Democracy for America  named Keever as one of newest members of the Dean Dozen - candidates supported by Howie D. and his grassroots network.  From DFA's email announcement, "Retired public school teacher Patsy Keever needs your help today. The Republican incumbent in the 11th Congressional District is a rubber stamp for George W. Bush... and we can change that. Democracy for America joins the grassroots of Democracy for North Carolina in enthusiastically backing Patsy Keever in her race to take back North Carolina. www.keeverforcongress.com"  This endorsement comes on the heels of backing by  urlLink Atrios at Eschaton  that's garnered Keever over  urlLink $6,100 in donations  in a week.  Keever's  urlLink bio at Emily's List  rounds out the fantastic endorsements that have come her way.  Keever's campaign team and army of over 600 active volunteers have been working tirelessly to reclaim the district for the working (or recently laid off) people of Western NC.  Give up some time or  urlLink money  for Patsy.  She's on a roll.

         The University of Washington has completed an extensive research project detailing the "skillful mixing of religion and politics helped President Bush silence critics and sell his policies on terrorism and Iraq to the nation, according to a new book that analyzes hundreds of public communications and news reports."  "In all but one of Bush's 15 national addresses between 9/11 and the end of major combat in Iraq, for example, he cast the campaign against terrorism as a simple struggle of good (America) vs. evil, according to Domke's book. And in four of the speeches, Bush issued explicit declarations that administration policies and goals were in line with divine powers.  Yet only two of the 326 post-speech editorials in 20 leading newspapers challenged the religiously derived notion of good vs. evil, and none questioned the president's statements about God's will."   urlLink Read the entire article here .

          Alan Keyes has, as  urlLink dKos  puts it, gotten "his announcement bounce".  Survey USA says the numbers look like this:   urlLink Barack Obama   (D)  67%  urlLink Alan Keyes     (R)  28%  Why is Alan Keyes running?  He knows he will not win.  He has never won, and there is very little popular support for any of his views in Illinois.  He is rabidly anti-abortion, anti-affirmative action, anti-labor, and, as far as I can tell, anti-winning.  The  urlLink Chicago Sun-Times has an interview  with Mr. Keyes that makes his run appear all the more baffling:  "You spoke Sunday about an uphill battle against Obama. Do you think you can beat him?"  "You know what I feel like when people talk about this whole hype about the convention speech and all this? Do you remember the "Wizard of Oz?" There was that scene in the "Wizard of Oz" that the Wizard of Oz was this big golden face and he was so impressive and so forth and so on. And then when Dorothy came to find out what was really going on, there was just this little guy who was pretending to be big.'  "I think we have to make sure that before we are drawing conclusions based on all this hype, we get a chance to look behind the wizard's projection to see what's really there."  But do you think you can you beat him?  "I certainly do. . . . When the Republican base is consolidated, it has always been competitive in Illinois. . . . That consolidation is then going to draw on that conservative Democratic sentiment that's there, people who are in the blue-collar areas and so forth, who are strong on Second Amendment rights. . . . And finally, I think that there are going to be folks in every community, including the black community, who will answer the challenge of moral principle. There is a deep difference between Barack Obama and Alan Keyes on  important issues like abortion and traditional family and support for marriage . And that extends across racial lines."  "Some people worry how little you know about Illinois. Can you name the last six governors?"  "No. I've made no bones about the fact that ---"  "Can you name four U.S. senators from Illinois from the past who you admire."  "Well that I might be able to do. I can name four U.S. senators from Illinois, not all of them do I admire though -- Paul Simon, Adlai Stevenson, Douglas, Percy. But let me, before you go into this stuff, make a clear point because I think it's important. I have not pretended to know the state of Illinois. And I'm not going to pretend to know it. I know a lot about the issues that confront people and affect the lives of people all over this country and also, of course, in Illinois. I have worked with people in Illinois on a lot of those issues. But when it comes to those things that are specific to the state in terms of background and personality and experience and all of that -- that's something I'm going to have to rely on others. I'm going to be learning -- "  Yeah, Alan, you're going to be learning what it feels like to take a Southside ass whoopin' from a skinny black kid with more vision than you can shake your carpetbag at.  Can someone from the Hooligan peanut gallery please opine on Keyes purpose here?

        The Very Reverend Martin Luther Agnew  urlLink preached a sermon  to the gathered faithful at an Episcopal Church in GWB's family hometown of Kennebunkport, Maine.  The Very Rev. told the congregation, whose numbers included Preznit Jeebus W. Bush and his ladywife Mrs. Laura Stepford Bush, "to jettison their material possessions".  T.V.Rev. Agnew went on, "Gated communities," Agnew said, "tend to keep out God's people." But, he said, "Our material gifts do not have to be a wall. They can very well be a door. Jesus says, `Sell your possessions and give alms,' I'm convinced that what we keep owns us, and what we give away sets us free."   "The former president sat stone-faced through this parable, even as his family, including the current President Bush, looked at him and smiled."  I would have loved to be there.

        There's so much international news from W's various war theaters that it seems indulgent even to mention domestic matters, but Hooligans do not fear indulgence.  In fact, we embrace it.  Indulge in the facts, friends:   Domestic:  Alan Keyes, the man who has called for the abolition of welfare, affirmative action, and abortion rights, is running against the unflappable, entirely attractive Barack Obama in Illinois' bizarre Senate race.  When Ryan imploded, Ditka exploded, and everybody else said "oh hell no",  urlLink Keyes stepped mightily into another unwinnable race .  Way to cement your place in history as black conservative most likely to lose every election he enters, Alan.  The "Kerry only served four months in Vietnam, so he must be a lying, pathetic wimp" meme is gaining strength in conservative circles.  The problem is it's not true.  The Swift Boat assignment was  urlLink Kerry's second tour in Vietnam .  Back to the drawing board, Karl.  When an Iraqi delegation visited Memphis to learn more about local governance, USA style, they were  urlLink denied entrance to City Hall .  City Council Chair Joe Brown said, "he would "evacuate the building and bring in the bomb squads" if the group entered."  And, if that humiliation weren't enough, the day after Councilman Brown's error two members of the delegation were  urlLink Robbed At Gunpoint .  The Group was last seen wondering if the whole world had, in fact, gone to hell.  Owner of The Washington Times, Reverend Sun Myung Moon,  urlLink sold the submarines  that now carry the nukes targeting our western shore to North Korea.  I wonder if this conservative stalwart will publish the news?  Gorenfeld has all the facts, links, observances, and wisdom.  This is just plain weird, folks.   Afghanistan:  Afghanistan is a right mess.  The long suffering people of this nation would love a chance to peacefully feed their families, but even the U.N. relief organizations who are used to operating in nasty locales are  urlLink scaling back and pulling out .  Eurasianet wonders whether the upcoming changes in the country will lead to  urlLink decentralization or civil war .   Iraq:  Jeebus...this place is so scary that even the Pakistani military, currently charged with bringing down Taliban cells in their own scary country, says that the situation is  urlLink just too dangerous to send troops .    urlLink Al Jazeera won't be reporting  from Baghdad for a month.  Former CIA operative and current Iraqi Prime Minister Allawi decides that free speech is uncalled for.  He's also decided that  urlLink human rights are uncalled for  - an American military unit freed a number of Iraqis being tortured and beaten...then they were told to return the prisoners to their abusers: The Iraqi Authorities.  Allawi has also  urlLink brought back the death penalty .    Capital punishment, some figure, might come in handy during Saddam's trial, which is being  urlLink headed up by Salem Chalabi , nephew of Ahmed Chalabi.  Both of the Chalabi boys have warrants out for their arrest, however.   urlLink Salem for murder, and Ahmed for counterfeiting .   urlLink Much attention  has been devoted to the role Ahmed Chalabi played in the Bush administration arguments for the war in Iraq.  Why didn't we just hand him over?   Iran:  George W. Bush will take us to  urlLink war against Iran  if he is re-elected.   The War on Terror...or is it Domestic:?  NYTimes reports that George W. Bush has  urlLink outed a double agent  providing us with Al Qaeda intelligence.  "Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan, who was arrested in Lahore secretly last month, had been actively cooperating with intelligence agents to help catch al Qaeda operatives when his name appeared in U.S. newspapers." Why?  Political expediency.  When his latest terror alert was deemed bogus by mainstream news organizations across America, Bush released the name of this agent who 'confirms' that Bush isn't  urlLink playing politics with national security  and likely dooming Mr. Khan to death.

      North Carolina's Eleventh Congressional District encompasses all of the mountainous counties in the western part of the state.  This is not Helms country.  It's not necessarily Bush country.  Buncombe County, home to the district's largest city, Asheville, went for Liddy Dole over  urlLink Erskine Bowles  in 2002 by only one vote.  Erskine's trying again to win a Senate seat, and he swung through the district Friday and Saturday to rally the faithful and prod the listless.   urlLink Patsy Keever , 12-year Buncombe County Commissioner, 25-year schoolteacher, and Vietnam Veteran Widow, accompanied candidate Bowles to rallies and fundraisers in Buncombe and Henderson Counties.  North Carolina primaries were held July 20th, and Patsy breezed past the progressive/radical Clyde Michael Morgan.  She garnered five times as many votes as the largely unknown Morgan in a low-turnout (12%) primary, and the campaign spent only about $15,000.  The Keever campaign has outraised multi-millionaire incumbent,  urlLink Charles Taylor  (more on him later), in each of the last three quarters.  The campaign has nearly a half-million dollars in the bank, and that's before, we're assured by local and national press, anyone is paying attention.  A half million dollars is a lot of money no matter where you are, but in the 11th district it's a king's ransom.    With over 500 registered, active volunteers, the campaign is making its presence felt across the district, with an especially large volunteer contingent in Taylor's home county, Transylvania.  An intern told this Hooligan that they anticipate an army of 1,000 volunteers by November.  With consistent phone banking, mailings, Letters to the Editor, and neighborhood canvassing efforts already underway, Keever has made the DNC stand up and take notice.    In hangover mode from the recent primary push, the campaign headquarters was quiet on Saturday.  A couple of interns shuffled about, cleaning and looking like they might not know what to do with themselves when not actively campaigning.  Patsy whisked in the door at 5pm, a bit wilted from the heat, but quick to join me on a small wicker sofa near the door.  "How are you doing?", Keever asked.  We talked a while about this hottest day of the year, and then about the time she spent with Senate candidate Bowles over the last 24 hours.  "He's just a regular person," She began, "saying some of the same things I've been saying, but in greater depth.  He has a depth of experience." Patsy looked to be sure that I was aware of Bowles history in the Clinton administration and then abruptly turned as a man walked in off the street.  "How are you?"  The man, Norris, a 30-year friend of Keever, informed her that he was organizing a music benefit for her campaign.  Keever was delighted, though unsurprised.  The groundswell of support has grown beyond the central control of campaign headquarters, and that's fine by campaign manager, Betsy Keever, who was taking the night off from her mother's campaign to celebrate her birthday.  Three high-school aged girls bounced into Keever headquarters, and Patsy tore herself away from Norris to greet them.  The girls were there to interview the candidate for some small publication, and Patsy gave them all the attention and respect that she afforded every other visitor, volunteer, friend, and campaign staffmember.    Aside from Keever's winning personality, fundraising prowess, and organizational wherewithal, she is standing on a strong democratic platform of Education, Health Care, Resource Management, Environmentalism, and Fiscal Responsibility.  Also, Keever is making a strong stand for veterans who have been negatively affected by the policies of the Bush administration supported by Charles Taylor.  Through the primaries, Keever had little problem focusing on those issues she holds dearest, though she anticipates Taylor will bring several wedge issues into the race.  Charles Taylor, largest landowner in WNC, Appropriations Chair of the Interior Committee, member of House subcommittees including: Commerce, Justice, States, and the Judiciary, has served for 14-years and has a well-earned reputation as a vicious campaigner.  His traditional tactics are likely to backfire on him with Keever, however.  Any attempt to paint the approachable, ethical Keever as crooked, dangerous, or un-american will simply make Taylor look like the bully that he is.  Taylor is currently under investigation by the House ethics committee for activities in his bank, Blue Ridge Savings and Loan, and he has presided over the longest sustained loss of manufacturing jobs in Western North Carolina history.    Keever's campaign is all about Keever.  Though Patsy's supporters are quick to call Taylor a criminal, unethical, clear-cutting, pork-barrel, Tom Delay Apostle, Keever herself never mentions Taylor's name.  This is a real pick-up opportunity for the Democrats in this November's elections.  Visit the  urlLink campaign website , donate time or  urlLink money , wear a button or t-shirt.  Thanks to  urlLink Atrios  for putting his support behind her.

          urlLink  From Reuters  : "Bruce Springsteen, the U.S. rock icon known as The Boss, will join two dozen other stars in nine "battleground" states for a rock 'n' roll tour aimed at ousting President Bush, organizers said on Wednesday.   The "Vote for Change" tour -- 34 shows in 28 cities -- is scheduled for the first week of October, one month before the U.S. presidential election.   "The tour is aimed squarely at the radical right wing policies of Republican ideologues throughout the country," said Eli Pariser, executive director of MoveOn PAC, the online liberal political action committee presenting the tour.   Six concert lineups will play simultaneous shows in a blitz of so-called swing states -- those that could go either Democrat or Republican in November: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Wisconsin.   "I felt like I couldn't have written the music I've written, and been on stage singing about the things that I've sung about for the last 25 years and not take part in this particular election," said Springsteen, who has avoided direct political work in the past.   Dave Matthews, James Taylor, the Dixie Chicks, James Taylor, Pearl Jam, R.E.M, John Mellencamp, Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt are among the performers donating their talent and time to get Democrat John Kerry into the White House.   Proceeds from the tour go to America Coming Together, another liberal political action group.   "A vote for change is a vote for a stronger, safer, healthier America," Matthews said. "A vote for Bush is a vote for a divided, unstable, paranoid America."   MoveOn will offer ticket specials to  urlLink MoveOn.org  members.     Stop Tom DeLay, the man who simply rewrites the rules or redraws the map when he doesn't like what our democracy presents him, is in the sights of Howie D. and the DFA crowd.   urlLink Sign The Petition .     Kerry is working the red states.  Bobbing and weaving into Bush territory while GW tries to solidify his base.  The tide is rising.  Go tell your neighbors and your friends that, no matter what dirty tricks the BushRove posse throw at them in the next 90 days, John Kerry is America's chance to redeem herself in history.  Eli Pariser, Howard Dean, and the entire Kerry campaign team are working tirelessly to get our lanky, purple-hearted, aristocratic Kerry and his carteresque, aw-shucksin', son-of-a-will-murker sidekick Edwards into the White House else the Bushies take this nation further into disrepute and this world further into chaos.  What will you do today to help the not-nearly-as-bad guys win?  Call someone?  Send emails?  Donate to a PAC, a 527, a local election?  Volunteer for the democratic party in your town?  Write letters to the editor?  What?

        How many years has the federal government been in surplus over the last fifty? Before I answer that question, lets consider why I ask it. As someone who does finance for a living, I can attest to the fact that the best financial plans are built on assumptions of what will happen in the future and these never go quite as planned. But most plans hedge for this type of risk. One very good way to hedge is to reserve for potential unfavorable events. If the sales manager says they are going to rake in $1 million, you only plan for $800 thousand. Another way to hedge is to have multiple revenue lines and multiple expense lines. Each line has a probability of being wrong, but if there are enough of them, then the errors tend to offset.  The federal budget is this enormously complex thing. Tax revenues coming from companies big to small, individuals rich to poor, land fees, excise fees, tarrifs, etc. Expenses covering the gamut. Under this circumstance, the discipline of statistics alone would say that the federal government would always take in more or less than it spends in any given year. But, over long periods of time the deficit or surplus created would be very small because one year’s up would be cancelled by another year’s down. So, a statistician would answer the question I opened with by saying that approximately twenty five out of fifty years we should see surpluses. Well, since 1954 the federal government has run surpluses eight times. So they have gone 42 out of fifty budgets in red ink. Imagine flipping a coin and it lands on heads eighty four times out of one hundred. Boy, I don’t know. Especially considering that the fifty years leading up to 1954 we had twenty surpluses. With a depression and a two wars in that period, you can see my logic is based on something.   urlLink So our national debt is likely to reach $7.8 trillion by the end of this year . That’s the cost of one thousand thousand thousand thousand six packs of premium beer with tax and bottle fee included. Or, that’s the federal government’s tax receipts for almost four years. Or that’s roughly 70% of gross domestic product in a year. Bottom line, the debt is going to be hella hard to pay off. If we wanted to pay it off in ten years, it would require belt tightening by citizen and government alike. Government would have to spend less while citizen pays more. The goal of reducing or eliminating the deficit is meaningless. The deficit is just the amount we add to our national debt each year. Its going to be something around $417 billion this year.  What we have to address is how we bring down the debt. In order to do this, the government must run large surpluses for a sustained period, perhaps eight to twelve years. If we put ourselves on a plan to reduce debt over a longer period either events or indiscipline would overtake us and we would be back to square one. Below is a table which shows how the government could drastically reduce the debt over a ten year period. It relies on a 1% tax increase each year for five years which reverses itself by a 1% annual decrease in the reaming periods. It also relies on government spending going down by 1% each year for the whole ten year period. This is probably way too simplistic, but at least we can start the dialogue. Ask questions like, which taxes would we raise by how much to get this revenue increase? Or if congress is expecting a 4% spending increase next year, a 1% cut would mean a $30 billion cut from this year’s level but also a $120 billion cut from their expectation. Where could this come from?     Has either major party even come close to this proposal? Do we need Ross Perot to jump in the race again? As John Kennedy said in his 1960 convention speech, “we need leadership, not salesmanship.”    urlLink Special Thanks to FRED II.

          We Hooligans spend a lot of time and energy sweatin' Bush and his lyin' posse in DC.  And that's ok.  We like it.  However, it has come to this Hooligan's attention that in our rush to expose Bush we're missing out on some stories about the two-bit, no account, chromosomally challenged individuals declaring and doing all sorts of nonsense in the name of the Party of Bush, the Party of Lincoln, the Grand Old Party, the...   urlLink I Love the Cock Party :  "State Agriculture Commissioner Charles Sharpe (R-SC) was indicted Thursday on 14 federal felony corruption charges for allegedly accepting at least $20,000 in bribes to help protect the state's illegal cockfighting games from avoiding prosecution by his and other agencies. US Attorney J. Strom Thurmond Jr. said that an undercover officer made recordings of meetings Sharpe had with the cockfighting organizers and local law enforcement officers in which Sharpe told the police officers that the activities were legal by both his determination and an opinion from the Attorney General's office. Thurmond said the AG Opinion was "a fake." Governor Mark Sanford (R) immediately suspended Sharpe and began the search for an interim replacement. Sharpe, 65, immediately surrendered himself in federal court, entered a plea of not guilty, and posted a $100,000 bond. If convicted of the extortion and money laundering charges, Sharpe faces up to 20 years in prison on each of the main felony counts."   urlLink The Purify Our White Race Party :  "NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Republican congressional candidate James L. Hart acknowledges that he is an "intellectual outlaw."  He is an unapologetic supporter of eugenics, the phony science that resulted in thousands of sterilizations in an attempt to purify the white race. He believes the country will look "like one big Detroit" if it doesn't eliminate welfare and immigration. He believes that if blacks were integrated centuries ago, the automobile never would have been invented.  Despite his radical views, Hart may end up winning the Republican nomination because he is the only GOP candidate on the ballot in Thursday's primary. His presence in the campaign has embarrassed Republican leaders, who were blind-sided by Hart after they didn't bother fielding a candidate. Democratic Rep. John Tanner has held the seat for 15 years and is considered safe in November."   urlLink The Really, We're Not Terribly Worried Party :  John Kerry's bounce has arrived.  Despite all of the did he or didn't he regarding the post-convention, we're just now beginning to see the poll effects of the DNC.  The biggest surprise: New Battleground State - Tennessee.  Kos reports it, and I steal it quicker than a Halliburton executive in the IRS.   urlLink The Stepford Wife Party :  "First lady Laura Bush campaigned Friday for U.S. Senate candidate Richard Burr, telling supporters that her husband needs him to remain in Congress to push the administration's agenda.  "When you leave here today, I ask you to redouble your efforts to help elect Richard Burr to the Senate," she told about 300 people at a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser at UNC-Wilmington.  "We have about three months left before this election," Bush told supporters. "Every vote we can get for Richard Burr means a better and stronger America. He's someone who represents your hopes and dreams."  Burr, a five-term congressman from Winston-Salem, will face former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles in the November election. The winner will replace Democratic U.S. Sen. John Edwards".     urlLink Not The Peace and Freedom Party Party :  "The California Peace and Freedom Party has nominated jailed American Indian activist Leonard Peltier as its presidential candidate this year.  The move was a blow to independent candidate Ralph Nader. Nader spoke at the party’s convention this weekend, the day before they officially nominated Peltier. Nader needs 153,000 valid signatures by August 6 to put him on the presidential ballot this November. Kevin Akin, chairman of the California Peace and Freedom Party, said delegates decided to bypass Nader because Peltier’s candidacy is “very important."   urlLink Why The Hell Are These Guys on the Same Ballot as Us Party :  In New Jersey "Candidates for president and vice president include Michael A.

      Here is a new concept to health insurance. It's called an HSA, or Health Savings Account. It's a tax free savings account for you to pay your health bills. From what I understand, all you need is a high deductible health insurance, $1,500 or or more to cover major health issues. You open an HSA savings account at your local bank and the money you put into it is tax free, and you use that money to pay your small health bills. So you can save tax-free money and pay a really low health insurance price. Another good benefit is that it turns the health care industry into a consumer driven market where buyers are looking for the best price as opposed to paying over-inflated bills because their insurance company pays for it.  You can check out info on HSA's on the  urlLink Department of Treasury Site .  Clark Howard has info on it as his site  urlLink www.ClarkHoward.com . Type "HSA" into the search box. For those of you who don't know him, he's a consumer advocate in Atlanta. His site is filled with excellent advice.

      Well it seems that W isn't the only slow one in the White House. According to the  urlLink WaPo ,  urlLink NY Times , and  urlLink CNN  the information that lead to the most recent elevated terror alert is three years fresh. Tom Ridge today defended his position that " urlLink This is the most significant, detailed pieces of information about any particular region that we have come across in a long, long time, perhaps ever ." Except that the information that Al Qeada was planning to use commercial aircraft to attack important US urban targets was gathered at the same time. This poses an interesting question that Michael Moore raised in F9/11: is the present administration just peddling fear to keep the American public under its thumb? I am not trying to downplay the severity of a possible attack against any of the targets named in this alert, but to have such a knee-jerk reaction to information that is older than any of my boxer shorts is just a little far fetched. To all of a sudden start searching handbags and putting up road blocks and vehicle check points based on stale data reeks of scare mongering. I personally think this is a political play by the White House. Their war isn't going as planned, and the public is becoming more and more disillusioned with reports of our men and women dying in some ill conceived campaign. What better way to distract America than to raise the specter of an imminent domestic terror attack. This just stinks of politicking to me.

          One.  The Kerry/Edwards campaign has published, both online and in that old-fashioned sliced tree stuff,  urlLink Our Plan For America .  This golden glowed treatise comes complete with  urlLink a handy summary  that will help you outdo the Rove-Goebbels crowd when it comes to snappy talking points.  Of course, it's always better to have one's own thoughts about these matters, but do desperate times call us to bottle our outrage into edible packages?  Below are the blogbitten versions of each of these already very short paragraphs on each issue.  For the johnkerry.com version click  urlLink HERE  (recommended)  How do these canapes taste to you?   Restore America's Respect in the World and Make us Independent of Mideast Oil:  Today, we face four great challenges above all others - First, to win the global war against terror; Second, to stop the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons; Third, to promote democracy, freedom, and opportunity around the world, starting by winning the peace in Iraq; Fourth, end our dependence on Mideast oil. To meet these challenges, Kerry and Edwards will:    Launch and Lead A New Era Of Alliances.     Modernize The World's Most Powerful Military To Meet New Threats.    Deploy All That Is In America's Arsenal.    Free America From Its Dangerous Dependence On Mideast Oil.    Create New Jobs, Strengthen the Middle Class, and Ensure Educational Opportunity    Reward Companies that Create Jobs in America.    Strengthen the Middle Class.

I'm still hoping Ralph Nader will have an enlightening conversation with the hair by who's breadth this election will be decided.  But, even if he, like Mike Tyson, insists on climbing into a ring that's clearly outgrown him, we can take comfort in the info  urlLink dKos published   from Delaware Dem today about on how many ballots we'll actually see Mr. Nader.  The rundown:   States where Nader is or possibly could be on the ballot which are troubling: Florida North Carolina West Virginia Michigan Arizona Colorado Nevada Indiana  States where Nader is or possibly could be on the ballot where we say "Who cares?": Mississippi South Carolina Illinois Rhode Island New Jersey Montana Kansas  Texas

          urlLink August 2, 2004  " We are a nation in danger ," Mr. Bush said today as he announced his position during an appearance with top administration national security figures in the White House Rose Garden.    urlLink July 12, 2004  "Today, because we're working with the Pakistani leaders, Pakistan is an ally in the war on terror, and  the American people are safer ." "Today, because America has acted, and because America has led, the forces of terror and tyranny have suffered defeat after defeat, and  America and the world are safer ."  and before i forget, from  urlLink Folkbum !

         A while back, the evil empire that is the record industry (that sound spun enough?) was spanked in a class action lawsuit brought by 43 state governments for conspiring to keep CD prices high. (More on that another time.) That's right... 43 states. As part of the 143 million dollar settlement, evil music distributors agreed to donate 73 million dollars worth of music to public libraries. Sounds like a great idea. Now, as the boxes of goods finally roll in, it seams the EVIL empire continues to salt our wounds by sending 1,355 copies of Whitney Houston singing "The Star-Spangled Banner" and 609 of Michael Bolton's Timeless: The Classics to one district library. And this is not an isolated case, there's lots.  urlLink Read all about it here from Rolling Stone.  So, make sure you hop right down to your local library and slap your copy of Martha Stewart Living: Spooky Scary Sounds for Halloween down on the counter and say "Ring it up you sexy book worm" before all 50 copies are checked out. Thanks WEA.

          Well folks, its election year, the Republicans are not where they expected to be, so its time to  shake things up.  urlLink Matt Drudge   has the exclusive, it seems that the speaker of the house is going to push for the elimination of the IRS....read below...  'A domestic centerpiece of the Bush/GOP agenda for a second Bush term is getting rid of the Internal Revenue Service, the DRUDGE REPORT has learned.  The Speaker of the House will push for replacing the nation's current tax system with a national sales tax or a value added tax, Hill sources tell DRUDGE.  "People ask me if I’m really calling for the elimination of the IRS, and I say I think that’s a great thing to do for future generations of Americans," Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert explains in his new book, to be released on Wednesday.  "Pushing reform legislation will be difficult. Change of any sort seldom comes easy. But these changes are critical to our economic vitality and our economic security abroad," Hastert declares in SPEAKER: LESSONS FROM FORTY YEARS IN COACHING AND POLITICS.  "“If you own property, stock, or, say, one hundred acres of farmland and tax time is approaching, you don’t want to make a mistake, so you’re almost obliged to go to a certified public accountant, tax preparer, or tax attorney to help you file a correct return. That costs a lot of money. Now multiply the amount you have to pay by the total number of people who are in the same boat. You can’t. No one can because precise numbers don’t exist. But we can stipulate that we’re talking about a huge amount. Now consider that a flat tax, national sales tax, or VAT would not only eliminate the need to do this, it could also eliminate the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) itself and make the process of paying taxes much easier."  "By adopting a VAT, sales tax, or some other alternative, we could begin to change productivity. If you can do that, you can change gross national product and start growing the economy. You could double the economy over the next fifteen years. All of a sudden, the problem of what future generations owe in Social Security and Medicare won’t be so daunting anymore. The answer is to grow the economy, and the key to doing that is making sure we have a tax system that attracts capital and builds incentives to keep it here instead of forcing it out to other nations."

          urlLink MSNBC reports  that the Grand Jury charged with investigating Valerie Plame's outing has questioned Secretary of State Colin Powell about conversations regarding Joseph Wilson's refutations of administration Yellowcake/Saddam he had on a plane trip with President Bush.  Hooligans agree - This story is fixing to blow the Bush campaign well off course.  If you aren't willing to pledge fealty to your Preznizzle, then don't go around thinking you can watch him or his minions speak.  Loyalty Oaths necessary to see Bush and Cheney on the campaign trail.  From  urlLink Albuquerque, New Mexico  and  urlLink Casper, Wyoming  newspapers.  "Why don't they get new jobs if they're unhappy -- or go on Prozac?"  urlLink said Susan Sheybani , an assistant to Bush campaign spokesman Terry Holt."  This president and his minions care about you...don't they?  Representative Charles Taylor, being challenged by the squeaky clean  urlLink Patsy Keever  this November, touts his contempt of our American system of checks and balances and his support for making bigotry the law of our land in his latest email to supporters, "Last week, the House passed H.R. 3313, the Marriage Protection Act, by a vote of 233-194. This bill would prevent unelected, lifetime-appointed federal judges from striking down the provision of the Defense of Marriage Act - which Congress passed in 1996 by an overwhelming margin in both the House and Senate - providing that no state shall be required to accept same-sex marriage licenses granted in other states. I was proud to cast my vote in strong support of the Marriage Protection Act, and I believe that it will curb the excessive power that many activist judges now wield on the federal bench. This legislation affirms the centuries-old belief that marriage is an institution between a man and a woman. The Marriage Protection Act must now be considered by the United States Senate."  Let me get this straight...we're supposed to support the troops, but we can't mention the troops without it being a political issue?  We can't memorialize these troops we support?  That's what  urlLink town fathers in Duxbury, Mass.  think.  They took down Yellow Ribbons.  Some people say they must hate America.  Speaking of our Lauded War on Terror and how much safer we've become due to the Blair/Bush administrations' policies -  urlLink The House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee has released a report  explaining exactly how the efforts of the "Bring it on" President and his British Lapdog have made the world a more dangerous place.   urlLink Paying an Iraqi family for killing their 8-year-old daughter: $710 ; Invading a country on false pretenses while wrapping yourself in the flag: Priceless.  Lastly, a story  urlLink widely reported across the blogosphere  - The Florida Republican party gives Jeb and George the vapors by releasing its call for Republicans to vote absentee in order to avoid the failed touch-screen voting machines.

        Word up to the gubinator.  urlLink He finally got a budget through . Though many days late and just 15 billion dollars short, the gubinator is “pumped.” Now he’s set to take the offensive. He’s going to pump CA – LI – FOHN – YA up. Despite the fact that the gimmicks in this budget are almost the same as what got Gray Davis in so much trouble, this won’t hardly make a dent in his polling numbers. We Californians continue to be star struck.
