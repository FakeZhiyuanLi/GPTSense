      You play the lead in a specialist team of US Green Berets nicknamed 'Ghosts' because they move swiftly and without detection.  You're in control of a group of six soldiers, and are able to switch between them at the touch of a button. The squad management has been handled well, as have the controls. The variety of commands at your disposal is limited but my view is that this is a bonus, as it keeps things nice and simple.  The enviroments look pretty good, without any mind-blowing visuals, although the attention to detail on the soldiers themselves is impressive. As a single-player game it's completely immersive, although on Xbox Live it is promoted to must-have status. This is what your Xbox was built for.

      Even if you're not nuts about biking, you'll still enjoy MotoGP 2. This game offers so much more than the handbraking, skidding world of car racers. It's simple and stupidly, mind-meltingly fast.  The detail is amazing, sometime it feels like you're watching a televised race. Layer after layer of extra details clings to the bikes and the tracks. Bikes are ridiculously well detailed and the colour palette has been used to the full. It looks mint.  The extra effort in visuals has been matched in the aural department, crowd and engine noises are searing.  The feeling of being slap-bang in the middle of a race is intense.  But it's the divine, subtle handling that makes me really love this game. There's also a very deep career mode that will hook you in and never let go. The addition of four-stroke engines means there's more scope for improvement. They are harder to ride, but can offer faster times.  It's also possible to race on Xbox Live and this adds a whole new dimension to what is already an accomplished single-player game.  Add in the new tracks -all great- and the brilliant bike customisation facility, and you'll find that MotoGP 2 is way ahead of the pack, even now.

      The feature of Xbox design that comes closest to the player, the Xbox controller is the most sophisticated consule input device ever created. While the control options it offers are available on other systems, the pad has been designed with the input of thousands of gamers, and represents the most complete fusion of practicallity and comfort.

      This game rocks!! If you fancy playing an offline game i wud really recommend this,  The story is superb (although slightly confusin at times, especially if u dont know the events/characters of the first game) but its still great fun to play.  The physics r amazing, the lightings fantastic and the open ended gameplay is 2nd to none (with 4, or 5 different endings depending on the choices u make in game).  Biomods r really cool too allowing u to see thru walls, jump higher, run faster, go invisible to people/machines, dominate robots (oooer mrs), u also get drones which help u along ur way,  whether they b a health leech drone (to heal urself by sucking the life out of dead people/cats/penguins etc) a biotox attack drone (which will fire non lethal darts at enemies to knock them out) or an aggressive defense drone (which will blow up any enemy rockets as soon as the enemy fires them hurting the enemy).  The game took me 13 hours to complete it through once, (which is quite gud for a game these days) then theres the replay value of multiple endings too  I've played it through 4/5 times now and its been a different experience every time, which is, again, all down to the choices YOU make (e.g. someone asks u to kill someone for them, do u A: ignore em B:do as they ask C:Shoot em in the face D: set them on fire, etc the list goes on).  I will warn u it does start off a bit slow (ur limited on wat you can do until u leave the tarsus academy) but it soon opens up after that.  Basically its a great game and is worthy of ur attention, if u havent played the first game "Deus Ex" then i wud recommend u "Rent" Invisible War from your local Game Store under their no fuss 10 day returns policy u cant lose!!  ooooh and..... Dont let the "Coffee Wars" missions put u off (i know theyre cr@p )  Reviewer: Jambo20

      IndyCar Series 2005 is Codemasters' second officially licensed IndyCar game and, despite the fact that a PS2 version will be released in Europe, it's exclusive to the Xbox in North America--at least for the moment. The game addresses a number of the flaws in last year's version, and it adds online play via Xbox Live. However, unless you're a dedicated fan of the sport, it's unlikely that the game's focus on car setups, strategies, and never-turn-right racing will appeal.   Fans of the sport will appreciate the game's depth, but it's not very accessible. Whether or not you're a fan of IndyCar racing, the first gameplay option you'll want to take a look at is the master class tutorial section. The master classes, which are narrated by an occasionally disinterested-sounding Dan Wheldon, do an extremely good job of introducing you to all aspects of IndyCar racing, including basic and advanced driving techniques, drafting, setting up your car, pit stops, and the rules of the sport. The master classes have bronze, silver, and gold target times for you to aim for, but, if you didn't play last year's game or if you're unfamiliar with the sport, you'll find that even achieving the bronze times can be a real challenge. The times are, for the most part, impossible to achieve with a default car setup, and while making changes to your car is easy, knowing what needs changing isn't. Deviating from the tarmac or making even the slightest contact with another car or wall brings your attempt to an abrupt end, and the master classes also force you to play with manual gears. The manual gears option is actually a good thing given that you can accelerate more quickly and rarely need to change once you're up into fifth gear, but if you're used to playing your racing games in automatic mode, this will be difficult to get used to.          Your success in the master classes, and in the races themselves, is as dependent on your ability to set up a car as it is on your ability to drive it, and this is what makes IndyCar Series 2005 so different from other racers. If you don't take the time to test and tweak your car ahead of qualification sessions and races, then no matter how well you drive, it's unlikely you'll be finishing in a podium position. The car setup options in the game are extensive and, if you're not knowledgeable about such things, they might initially seem a little daunting. There are good explanations for all of the setup options available to you, though, and it won't be long before you're gaining valuable seconds by tinkering with tire pressures, springs, dampers, gear ratios, ride height, wheel cambers, downforce settings, and the toe-in of your front wheels. With that said, those of you who already have knowledge of such things will be at a definite advantage. The game would, however, benefit from the addition of some kind of chief mechanic character who could offer advice specifically relating to your current car setup and the next race.   The game contains 15 tracks, though since they're all about racing on an oval, there isn't a whole lot of difference between them. After taking the time to test and tweak your car setup, you're given a limited number of qualification laps to earn a place on the grid before heading to the oval for the race. All 15 of the circuits used in the latest IndyCar season are featured in the game but, while no two of them are the same, you won't be surprised to learn that they offer very little in terms of variety when compared to other racing games. In fact, you can pretty much just divide the circuits up into "long" and "short" categories--long circuits being those that you can race without ever easing off the accelerator, while shorter circuits require you to slow down for corners. Race length options start at a mere 10 laps and go all the way up to the full distance of 200 laps. It's possible to set up shorter races in such a way that at least one pit stop is required for refueling, but the longer races, which can become mind-numbingly repetitive at times, are actually far more interesting--at least as far as race strategies are concerned.   Unlike most racing games, IndyCar Series 2005, like the sport it's based on, is quick to punish you for even the tiniest of errors. Lose your concentration for a second and you'll most likely find yourself slamming into a wall, spinning out, or, at the very least, deviating from the racing line and being overtaken. Catching up with other cars is no easy task either, so unless you've opted for one of the longer race distances available, a single mistake will invariably ruin your chances of winning. Like much of what IndyCar Series 2005 has to offer, its unforgiving nature is realistic, but would-be racers who aren't big fans of the sport will probably never enjoy the game on anything but the easiest of its three difficulty settings. The easy setting not only slows down the CPU cars quite considerably, but also does away with some of the more advanced techniques that fans of the sport will enjoy, such as weight jacking midrace to correct steering problems, and adjusting your fuel mixture to achieve extra speed or to run additional laps in between stops. Both of these advanced techniques are activated simply by tapping the analog stick, and they are actually a lot easier to use effectively than they sound.

      Generally speaking, the Marvel Comics legend Spider-Man has always done reasonably well for himself in the world of video games. That trend continues with the latest team-up from Activision and Treyarch in Spider-Man 2. Though the movie-themed game bites off a little more than it can chew with its attempt at an open-ended design, it gets a few key mechanics right and gives you just enough things to do to offset what would have otherwise been a pretty short, simple game. It's still worth checking out as a companion piece to the movie, even though its terrific first impression doesn't hold up throughout the entire length of the experience.   Peter Parker: Photographer by day. Crime fighter by night. The main mechanic that makes Spider-Man 2 worth playing is the way you swing around the city. The game offers an optional simplified control scheme for easier swinging, but it's worth getting used to the more complex standard swing mode, because it's really the best part about the entire game. Spider-Man 2 gives you a large rendition of Manhattan to freely roam around in, and swinging from building to building--which looks convincingly similar to Spidey's thrilling webswinging sequences from the movie--is a good deal of fun all by itself. Your movement options make exploring the city entertaining for a while--even if the things you do outside of simply exploring don't really end up being all that exciting.   The game loosely follows the plot of the new film, which pits Spider-Man against the menacing Doctor Octopus. But since only one supervillain doesn't seem like enough for a game, Spider-Man 2 tosses in a few others, like the Rhino and Mysterio. The game is relatively short on story, however. Even the game's dull boss encounters seem to come out of nowhere. It has a handful of cutscenes to accompany the more important sequences, though most of these noninteractive sequences are simply used to briefly set up an action sequence. Most of these in-engine sequences look pretty bad because the character models really don't look so hot up close.          Unfortunately, much of your time playing the game will be spent uncovering relatively little content spread across an admittedly large environment. The game is broken up into chapters, and it feeds you objectives as you proceed. Each chapter also has an obligatory goal that earns you a set number of "hero points." These points are earned whenever you complete a basic task, like beating up some thugs, and they can be spent on upgrades that grant Spider-Man some new moves and combos. And while there are a number of different ways to earn the extra hero points you'll need, none of them are particularly interesting. The one with the most potential is the ability to seek out and solve random crimes in the city--but there are only a handful of different types of crime scenarios to be found.   The game forces you to take on a lot of extra objectives just to earn enough hero points to proceed. In practice, you'll always find yourself running up to citizens in distress only to hear that there's an armored car holdup, a car being stolen, a shoot-out, a man about to fall off the side of a building, or a man in need of a lift to the hospital. Or, sometimes it's an ambush, and you'll just have to fight your way out of it. The short list of possible tasks means that you'll be doing the same things over and over again and that the element of surprise quickly disappears. And even though the circumstances occasionally change, these tasks do get old fast. Aside from this, you can also spend your free time in the city delivering pizzas or going on timed-race challenges that ask you to jump through glowing hoops (and things of this nature) to test your speed and dexterity. If you're the type of person that enjoys time attack modes, these types of missions will be right up your alley, but they aren't really all that relevant and also get old quickly, since you'll be doing plenty of webswinging during the rest of the game.   Actually, since you'll have to take on a handful of these types of extra tasks in almost every chapter in Spider-Man 2, they seem like they were designed to merely pad out the game's length. And, in fact, by forcing you to do these things, the game gets up to around the ten-hour mark before it reaches its conclusion. Without having to stop to deal with these extras, though, the game would have moved very quickly through its few plot points, and we would have been done in a few hours. Thankfully, these core story missions are more interesting. You'll have to take on master criminals, you'll explore a fun house, you'll have to navigate a hovering obstacle course to prove that you aren't a hoax, and so on. By and large, most of these challenges aren't especially difficult, so you'll likely get through each one on your first or second attempt.

      Admit it , no game on xbox live has ever been as fun and playable as moto gp2, this however could be set to change. I have managed to get myself a copy of pro race driver 2 and i can honestly say it is pure class. The graphics are smooth, and easily as good as project gotham 2 (if not better!). The cars handle and feel like they should , put your foot down too early out of a corner and youll spin more than a thing that spins alot ,which means that perfect racing lines are a must! The 1 player mode is challenging and youll probally find yourself restarting alot of races until you learn the courses, but if anything it just makes the game even more playable. Overall its an exellent game, a 1 player mode which is as good as moto gp2 and a xbox live mode that looks like it could wipe moto gp from our memorys forever!

      Twas the eve of the release of "Steel Battalion: Line of Contact" and Mr Badger was at home minding his own business, when he received a call.  Withheld Number came up on the screen and these are the sort of calls I don’t like getting but I thought "bugger it, might be interesting to see what it is.  ” Oooh! It was Paul from my local gaming emporium.  "Hello *Badger* you still interested in getting SB: LOC”, I feigned mild interest (Just in case he was being greedy with the price) and he told me he actually only received One copy --- Uh Oh! Here comes the price increase ......  and that the copy was mine if I wanted to come and get it.....Phew!  Ten minutes later a very large and Orange KTM SuperMoto bike barked into life and headed for the local Emporium of all that is wonderful and console/game flavoured.  I wandered in and removed my helmet and the guys behind the counter had happy and envious looks on their faces (happy `cos they were about to get £130 of my hard earned cash - well almost - and envious `cos I was walking away with the only copy for miles and they hadn’t had a go of it).  I popped open the wallet and swiped them the required amount and they went into the back to get the box for me..............  Now this is the moment you get in a film , the kind of moment where you see the dude’s face and the background just seems to ZOOM away whilst his jaw is wide open in disbelief (like the bit in Jaws when he says "we’re gonna need a bigger boat" .  The "box" that the game comes in is huuuuuuuge , easily the same size as 2 PC Towers stacked side-by-side, and Mr Badger here decided to go and collect it on his Motorbike...DOH! The guys kindly lent me a telephone cable from the shop to strap this behemoth to the rack on my bike.  Once I was happy that this wasn’t going to fall off or make me wheelie all the way home I had a very wicked thought, Someone I know on X-Box Live had been almost wetting themselves about this game and their copy wasn’t going to be with them `til the day after I got mine.  A quick piccy with the old camera phone and they were about to get a multimedia message from Mr Badger showing them that I was indeed in possession of the game a day early --- ahh lovely :¬) .  Ok now for the stuff that you are reading this review for.  The box was opened and inside was some very surprising things.  I assume that you all know that this game comes with a 40 button controller to control your "Vertical Tank" but also in the box is a rather handy Manual that is about the size of a Prima Strategy Guide (Large `cos it has all European Languages in it) , the controller is in 4 separate pieces and is easily assembled with the supplied Allen key , you also get "SB:LOC" but underneath was an even bigger surprise , you actually get the original "Steel Battalion" game that had everyone frothing at the mouth last year .  This is strictly an offline version of the game with no LIVE capabilities whatsoever, you want to play it Live then slap the SB: LOC DVD in and spin that baby up.  I opted to have a familiarisation session with the offline version so scurried off upstairs to try it out - by now I had an unprintable reply from the receiver of the picture message I had sent 20 minutes previously - something to do with not having a father and that I should do some unmentionable things to myself - Hey Ho Such is life!  Now I shall save you some time and tell you that the only Manual out of the 3 that comes with this package that is of any real value is the one inside the SB: LOC case, the other 2 manuals are more of a guide to the SB world whereas the LOC version is a guide on operating the VT and the Game itself.  So in time honoured tradition I bunged the manuals over my shoulder and steamed straight into the game.  Ok some American style drill instructor offering wise words and patronly style chit chat is showing me around the base and the latest hush hush type of VT when all of a sudden the base is attacked by the enemy and I volunteer to operate this latest model against them.  And this is where the game throws you right into it - no training or nothing, this is real "do or die" stuff, you are sat in the cockpit with another enemy VT right outside the hangar door battering the life out of it and trying to get at you first.  The lights on the controller flash, goading you into a now familiar start sequence and this is where all the realism comes into life - well as far as powering a very large mechanical device of War can ever be! You press a button to close the hatch and then thumb the ignition button to start the system up once you are encased in the cockpit.  All manner of start-up buttons flash in a test pattern and various monitors flicker into life - 5 toggle switches are thumbed over to bring various systems into life and then you get to press the big Red glowing Start button - PRESS, nothing, PRESS, nothing ---- oh my God there is another VT outside that desperately wants me dead and I have the equivalent of a rusty Austin Allegro with a flat battery trying to start on a cold October morning.  It is at this very moment that I am battered senseless and on the top right hand side a Very Large Red button flashes with some urgency.  This is the eject button. This is the button that if not pressed quickly enough will see your new game erased and leaving you with the prospect of registering as a new pilot and having to start your career all over again. A quick read of the manual and AHA! I know what went wrong. A new registration and a new life are born and I am back in the cockpit, switches are pressed, toggles are toggled and the button to start the VT up is pressed at the optimum moment when the systems are ready and stable.  The Right hand side controller stick helps your Heads Up Display (HUD) home in on your enemy and as soon as the enemy VT has beaten the door down the screen is screaming "LOCK ON" at me so I press the lock on button - Yeah the weapons system is now doggedly following this dude around as he now realises the VT in front of him is coming to tear him a new one - He beats a hasty retreat and I have to follow him. And for the next 4 minutes I am pressing buttons and scratching my head and wondering why this thing won’t walk and then it dawns on me - THE FOOT CONTROLLER! , 1st gear is selected and my huge VT is now walking after a deft press of the "accelerator" pedal and a second gear is selected followed by another one, The enemy VT stomps back into view and alarm bells go off as he decides to lock onto me and put me to the test, and this my friends is the first unforgettable moment you will have with SB, the first time you pull that trigger and thumb that button on the right hand stick and all hell lets loose.  Machine guns rasp into life and hammer armour piercing shells into the body of your enemy and rockets load up and fire from magazines on the side of your VT, he fires back at you and the only way to win is to get this lumbering war machine out of his way and pummel him into the afterlife. This is where the foot controller comes in handy. Apart from the obvious Accelerate and Brake pedals, is, a "Sidestep" pedal and this pedal is your greatest ally when it comes to battling with any VT in these games. If you have your Left hand side control stick to the left when you hit this pedal then your VT will jink to the Left or to the Right if held to the Right, simple enough. If you are walking forwards and press it then your VT will accelerate forwards at extreme speeds and the same if the VT is in Reverse Gear. USE THIS PEDAL WISELY, for once it has deen pressed it has to recharge itself from the generator core which can take a few seconds.  So, now we think we can dance rings around the enemy in this baby and batter him senseless into the next life - HANG ON A MOMENT! Onscreen is a warning called "BLNC" what does this mean! , a few seconds later I found out that this stands for Balance and my VT comes crashing down to earth in a glorious display of juddering screens and plows into the good war trodden Earth beneath me , UH OH! , 1st gear is selected and frantic stabbing of the GO pedal and my VT stands up and in the background is the ominous Stomp of my enemy homing in for the kill.  The Eject button flashes and this time I manage to bail out and save my life. BUGGER ME THIS IS HARD AND HAS COST ME A FORTUNE - I think to myself as the drill instructor "tuts" at me onscreen for being such a Newbie. Ok this dude is going down if it’s the last thing I do. Switches switched, toggles toggled aaah! You know the rest, stamp stamp stamp, lock on, machine guns blare - rockets do their thing and before you know it .......BOOM, the enemy explodes - YEEEEHAAAAA! gotchayerbugger - echoes from Mr Badger`s household and birds take off from the trees and the kids outside stop whatever they are doing to stare at the strange whoops of joy from that house on the corner .  Various missions later and I feel I am ready to go LIVE with the game and deftly slip the LOC disc into the old Green Box and give it a whirl. There are two modes online which consist of Campaign and Free mode, and it’s free mode that is probably the best to start with. This is where you will meet like minded SB players and the not-so like minded ones.  The Japanese players have had this game for a while now and are spookily good at it (some genetic mech thing they are born with) and the American players just want to "whupass" or something on newbie players for the points . A word of advice is to play with similar "noobs" and from your own country `cos (A) you wont get battered and start to hate the game (B) The dreaded LAG will not come into effect and (C) this is where you will find people willing to be a buddy with you, for the plain fact that you are from their country and have this game.  Online is the bit you will learn the most from this game and you will start to unravel what the manuals don’t and won’t tell you. Capcom has provided the bare basics of background and information which I think is a good thing as it helps you delve deeper into the Steel Battalion world. New VT`s become available at a certain time, parts can be fitted, weaponry can be swapped.... hell you can even trade VT`s and parts with other people online but a word of warning..... At a certain time at night the Servers that SB: LOC is played on will shut down for a half hour or so to do an update on the battle. If you have not finished a mission or campaign by this time you run the risk of losing some of your VT`s as I have found out to my cost.  On the Plus side this is an immersive experience that no X-BOX owner should be deprived of, I personally have played a lot of games in my years and think that this game has a lot to offer someone that is willing to put some hours into it. There is the camaraderie between players of similar rank, sometimes people like me willing to offer advice and help, battles to be won, crushing defeats to hang your head in shame to, elation at taking out a bigger VT than yourself, And you would be very surprised at how tactical some of your friends can be online in the face of a great war to wage on their enemies.  I will see you on the battlefield, where no doubt I will be goading Johnny Foreigner into a fight.  Mr Badger gives this game a 92% rating.

                We all knew it was inevitable, but now that the most hotly anticipated game in the world is official: Halo 2 is coming. The released trailer provided little more than a setting for the game and a glimpse into the revamped graphics engine, but now we’ve got a bit more information to keep Xbox owners going a bit longer as the release treads dreadfully closer. Bungie has always felt that Halo could have been better, so they’ll be going all-out with Halo 2. While still keeping close to the basic ideas set forth in Halo, the sequel will address the game’s major criticisms and expand on the team’s original vision. Although the sequel to the Xbox’s best-selling game will indeed bring us new weapons, vehicles, and enemies, Halo 2 is also going to be a whole lot more.  The story for Halo 2 picks up right where the ending of Halo left off. Somehow, the Covenant have located and destroyed all of the human colony worlds, and have now focused in on our last hope for survival – Earth. The Master Chief, now donning an all-new impressively detailed battlesuit, returns to earth in the Covenant ship he used to escape from Halo, only to find a planet scarred by Covenant attack. Unable to land, he instead braces himself up against a wall and opens the ship’s cargo bay, jumping out into space and directly onto a Covenant dropship orbiting the planet. With Cortana’s help, the Master Chief must defend the earth, then take the fight back to the Covenant’s home world in hopes of ending the war once and for all.  Halo 2 reveals a lot of the story behind the Covenant, as well as their motivations for attempting to eliminate the human race. The Covenant is comprised of two alien races - the Elites and the Prophets, the latter of which had not been introduced to us in Halo. The Prophets are a species that look similar in size and posture to the Grunts, but are actually the religious and spiritual leaders of the Covenant troops. The Prophets control the other alien forces in combat, but are probably very weak on their own. Halo 2 will also introduce yet another alien race into the mix, currently known as Brutes. The Brutes, much like the Flood in Halo, are hostile to both humans and Covenant. Though their true identity is still unknown, it is possible that they are actually the Forerunners, the race responsible for building Halo and containing the Flood.   Bungie is completely re-writing the enemy A.I. routines for Halo 2. Instead of focusing squarely on attacking and hiding, enemies will be able to adapt and interact to their environment in ways never possible before. They will also formulate group-oriented attacks, something that Halo touched on but didn’t have fully in place. Storming a base will alert every single enemy to your location, so they will already have a plan of attack in place once the Master Chief arrives. Bungie has always placed a higher emphasis on artificial intelligence, and Halo 2 is looking to be no different.   The A.I. of your marine allies has been beefed up as well. Whereas in Halo 1, in which each marine functioned primarily as a separate entity, in Halo 2 they are programmed to rely on one another and coordinate advanced attack strategies in combat. Soldiers toting assault rifles and shotguns will advance to the front lines, covering each other’s backs and warning one another of any potential hazards. Snipers will typically seek out a good vantage point up on a hill somewhere, then proceed to let loose on their unassuming targets from a safe distance. Marines may request backup fire in tight situations (not only from their buddies, but from yourself as well) or call upon one of their comrades to lob a grenade into a pack of enemies. Marines even have the ability to flip over objects and use them for cover as they see fit. As was the case in the original, the marines often have some important (and at times amusing) things to say, but you’ll have to be in the right place at the right time if you want to hear them. In fact, it has been said that at least 70% of the story will be communicated through in-game interactions such as these. And with all of the improvements geared towards smartening up the marine’s A.I., it’s safe to say that we’ll be seeing a lot more of them in Halo 2.   A large part of what made Halo’s combat such an intense, strategic experience was the weapon selection. Since the Master Chief could carry only two weapons at a time, the player was forced to decide which weapons to hold on to based on the enemies and the battlefield that lies ahead. If there’s a room full of jackals with plasma shields, you won’t want to run in blasting them with a needler, since the projectiles will simply bounce right back. That’s why the introduction of new weapons must be done carefully, with regards to retaining the delicate balance found in the original. We now know of two new weapons so far that have made the cut for Halo 2, one of which was showcased in the aforementioned trailer. The weapon from the trailer is a combination of the sniper rifle and assault rifle, which has come to be known as the battle rifle. The other is an automatic machine gun that fires caseless ammunition, and closely resembles a tentative model of the assault rifle that was seen in some of the pre-release screenshots for Halo. Of course, there are many more that have yet to be revealed, but the old standards are sure to be there as well.   To go along with his new look, the Chief will also have a handful of new tools at his disposal. First off, he now has the ability to peer around corners and check out a scene before entering it. Although he can’t shoot or toss grenades from this position, it allows him to keep tabs on nearby Covenant soldiers without getting tangled up into battle, and it may even provide him with an opportunity to eavesdrop on the enemy. And if that were not enough for you, then perhaps you’d prefer the idea of combo melee attacks. If you time your button presses properly, you’ll be able to string together up to three melee attacks into one skull-crunching combo. Lastly, the Master Chief will have the ability to pull down his weapon and break into a full sprint. While sprinting, any action or digressive movement will automatically throw you back into combat mode, so you needn’t worry about dashing headstrong into an alien nest unarmed, as you’re weapon is always just a touch away.   According to Bungie, Halo 2 will more than double the amount of vehicles from the original. New to the game is the Shadow, a Covenant equivalent of the Warthog that can carry up to four and comes equipped with a plasma cannon on the back. There’s also an ATV, which basically looks like a slimmed-down Warthog. The vehicle has no weapons, but can carry a single passenger faster than any other vehicle. Halo 2 also has three different models of the Warthog, each suited for different environments. The Jungle Hog has modified wheels, a chaingun, and camouflage cover; the Snow Hog comes with snow treads and an enclosed interior, yet appears to be unarmed; and the Transporter Hog has seating for up to 6 Marines, but also comes with no attached weaponry. Again, this is only a small taste of what’s to come.   The level design in Halo has long been a topic of debate. Many areas were startlingly similar in design, and some even relied on arrows painted onto the ground to keep players from getting lost. A lot of this was forced upon them – Bungie had to work under a very tight development schedule to get the game out in time for the Xbox’s launch. But with Halo 2, which they’ve already been working on for nearly a year, the team has a lot more time to work on the level design. Of course, since a good deal of the game will take place on Earth, many of the environments are going to be quite different from those in Halo. Man-made buildings will replace the alien architecture, and interior levels may even take us to well-known landmarks such as the White House or the Pentagon. It will be an entirely different experience, and the new setting will likely hit some of us a lot closer to home.   We all know the levels in Halo 2 are going to look a whole lot better, but Bungie isn’t content to stop there with the improvements. For starters, certain fragile objects in the game - things like columns, doorframes, and thin wooden structures, can be crushed, shattered, and otherwise blown to bits through repeated gunfire or explosions. And this isn’t strictly a cosmetic detail either, since the enemies are well aware of which surfaces can or cannot be destroyed. Certain sequences will also allow you to shoot out lights and hide in the shadows to take out the Covenant. Enemies may even come equipped with flashlights for low-light situations such as these. But keep in mind that the designers have no intention of turning the game into a stealth-based affair. This is still the same old Halo, only in a delightful, smartly refined form.   The multiplayer aspect of Halo 2 will be expanded to support multiplayer games over Xbox Live. There will be plenty of original maps, with a stronger focus on outdoor, vehicle-based levels like the ever-popular Blood Gulch map from Halo. Allegedly, the game will not include multiplayer bots, as Bungie would rather have people playing online or via split-screen. The developers envision large-scale, squad-based online games, something that will be made possible only through XBL.  As I’ve already hinted at, Halo 2 is not simply an add-on to Halo, nor is it Halo 1.5. It’s a full-on sequel in every way we could have ever dreamt it to be, and with it will come drastic improvements to what still remains one of the greatest games ever made. The expectations for Halo 2 are undoubtedly high, but from what we’ve seen so far the game could very well surpass the original, which in itself is a lofty proposition. We all have to wait until the release though to see hiw it turns out.

      It’s pretty obvious what a success Ubisoft’s console rendition of the Rainbow Six 3 series has been on the Xbox. You don’t stay at the top of the sales charts and manage to be the most played Xbox Live title for nothing. Even after its release last fall, Rainbow Six 3 is still going strong eight months later, and the lackluster PS2 effort helped to justify what we’ve known all along; games play better on the Xbox. While the single player campaign of Rainbow Six 3 (RS3) was solid, its real pay off was in the multiplayer. The team based gameplay was nearly perfect aside from a few early glitches and .50 cal happy gamers that didn’t care to get into the heart of the battle. A max of 8 on 8 players, fantastic level design, and downloadable content; how could you not love this game? Well, its time to get your G3A3 all polished up and ready to go because it’s insertion time for the latest installment of the Rainbow Six 3 series: Black Arrow. We’ve had some quality time with Ubisoft’s killer FPS and bring you our initial thoughts.  First off, rest assured that Black Arrow is a standalone game and not a simple expansion pack with only a few new levels. Black Arrow packs a lot of punch for its projected £16.99 price tag, including co-op split-screen mode, online clan support, and a host of new maps. RS3 vets will immediately feel right at home being that the game interface is almost identical to the previous game aside from the new features. The game is Live Aware, so you’ll automatically be logged into Live if you have an active account. It’s also good to know that the controls are exactly same as the last game, so no surprises there. The Rainbow Six 3 team of Chavez, Loiselle, Price, and Weber returns along with all of their original weapons and equipment found in the first game, save one change; the .50 cal M82A1 has been replaced with the 7.62mm Dragunov. That’s right, no more .50 cal my little sniping friends. There are still plenty of sniping areas to be found in the game, but it will just take a bit more skill now that the .50 cal has been axed.        Single Player   I know more people that own Rainbow Six 3 and have never played its single-player game modes than any other Xbox title out there. True, playing individually cannot replace the intensity of a heated Team Survival match, but the campaign mode was still as steady as any other Xbox FPS on the market. The AI of your teammates and enemies were a little shoddy at times, but you could still brush up on your skills before going online and enjoy a fairly decent storyline along the way. Black Arrow’s campaign mode contains 10 new levels that are a good mix of indoor and outdoor settings. You can tell that quite a bit of time has been spent in the level design to ensure that they play well in the single player game modes as well as online. Stats are now kept not only for multiplayer modes, but the single player modes as well. When at the briefing screen a new option of “Hi-Score” is available that will allow you to view statistics for the Campaign, Practice Mission, Terrorist Hunt, and Lone Rush game modes. So if you thought you were so money at Terrorist Hunt in the last game, you’ll now be able to check your skills versus the rest of the world on  Obviously all the single-player modes from the last game return, but the addition of Lone Rush gives the game a little more gusto. Lone Rush is a single-player game only, so no teammates here for assistance. The object is to make it to the finish line before the timer of one minute and thirty seconds expires. With the scope of these maps, it’s pretty obvious there is no way to get from Point A to Point B (alive) in 1:30. Luckily bonus time is awarded for every terrorist killed, hostage saved, or bomb disarmed. There are plenty of bad guys spread throughout the level that put up a stiff challenge even for the most seasoned RS3 player. Lone Rush tends to be quite addictive as far as a single-player game mode go and really helps to strengthen your twitch reactions for  being that the action is fast and furious. Any method that gives you an edge on the ins and outs of a map will prove to be extremely valuable online
