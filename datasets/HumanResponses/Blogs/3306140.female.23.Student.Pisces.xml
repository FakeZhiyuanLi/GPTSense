        I meet a guy about a week ago that seemed to be okay. But lately I have been spending a lot of time with him and I think that I have found a keeper. He is the most sweetest guy that I have meet in Tallahassee. I fought to tell you his name is Dwight or D.J. for short. We have been having so much fun this week, that I forgot all about all of the other guys that I meet and I want to be with him. We laugh about everything and the most important thing is that he is honest. I really need someone like that in my life. This weekend we are going to West Palm Beach, FL to visit my friend Zeanique because she got in a accident and he is going to visit my family. This is a big step for me because nobody has been home with me since  Anthony(me ex-boyfriend). So as you can imagine I am very scared. I hope that this is going to last because I want a boyfriend. But the really question is does he feel the same?

        I've had a bad week.  The week started off with a car accident. Yes people I got in a car accident on last Friday. Not only that it was a hit and run. Then I began to get sick. So now am I not only injured from the car accident, I am sick with a cold as well. This is what I want to happen on the day that my paper is due. Can this week get any worse? The answer to that million dollar question is yes it can and it will. As the week progressed I got a call from a friend telling me that my best friend of 20 years was in a horrible car crash and she is badly injured. Not as if my day could not get any worse. I lost one hundred dollar out of my purse.  Why do this thinks happen to me? Does life have no one else to pick on. I wonder what else this week has in store for me?

        This had to be the most eventful night in a very long time. My friends and I had nothing to do so we went out to the club. A guy that my friend Ashli knew bought us some drinks. I have a very high tolerance for alcohol but my friend does not. She started to act really crazy and doing crazy things. Her and the gut start fighting and she was hitting him. It all got really out of control real fast. I did not know what to do. Luckily this guy that I was talking to name Deon helped me get them apart and home safe. I don't what to ever get like to the point that I do dumb things. Maybe I need to not drink anymore to get that or maybe not.

        I think I excepted this summer to be much more than what it was. When actually this summer is just like any other day in Tallahassee. All i do is get up, go to class, eat, come home, eat, and go to sleep. this truly not what I excepted. I though that because I had a good week last week that I would have a good summer. But what I have to realize is that a week is just a week. It doesn't determine anything. LIVE DAY TO DAY IS THE MAIN THING TO DO.

      This paper has given me so many problems.First, I could not find the guide lines on the computer. Then after I found them the printer would not print. So I went to the home and just started to write the paper. I got all the way though the paper then the printer started to work. That is when I realize that the paper was on the wrong subject. How in the world did I write a paper on the wrong subject? I still don't know. At this point you think it could not get any worst right, wrong.

         Last night had to be the most confusing nights of my life. I meet a guy name Darell the night before. He is very beautiful by the way. He has this butter looking skin, soft hair, and beautiful eyes. But enough about his looks, I was going to have him for myself.  Only one problem he is eighteen years old. My heart sank, a eighteen year old boy. What am I going to do with him, play with him. This has got to be the most confusing thing right, but no it gets worst. I have another guy that is nice and caring but i never see him he lives in orlando. I really care for him and I want him to be my man but he lives so far away. I could go on about it but that is not all. There is another guy, he is great and loves me but he is in the military. I don't think I can take him dying on me, so I let he leave me without tell him I love you.  See i told you my life is full of drama.

        The night could not have got any better. My girls and i decided we has going to go out, but first we where going to go out to eat at B.W.3's.  As the night progress it seemed that we was not going to make it to b.w.3's. So Ashlie, Crystal, and I meet up with these very nice looking guys had some drinks and headed out to the Late Night Library Night Club. As we approch the door i see a guy that have had a crush on since high school. His name is Joe Warren. By now i want him like you would never believe.  So we talk and my friends and i walk in the club. If you can imagine we are on the scene. Everything was everything as they say. The really cute guys were still with us when we left the club. I got one of the guy number and the rest was history. If you know what I mean.

         It is the first day of classes and I have had to many problems to count. First I was told to come to the counseling office to get a contract for a self-pace course. But when I get there I can't get the course because my grade point average is to low. Then I we sit down a try to find solution for the problem but another obstacle gets in my way. We can get any classes for this term because classes have already started. Luck me I have to deal with the fact that all of my classes are in the same term. I tell you one thing, this is going to make for a interesting term.

      Why do people lie? You do not have to lie. It does not make your skin fall off if you tell the truth. Your life will not end if you tell the truth. So why tell lies. Does it hurt if you tell the truth? Or is it just impossible to do so? I hate I liar. So if you are one do not talk to me.

      My Sister is going to have my nephew in three days.  I can not wait for him to get here. I want to see my baby boy.  I love babies. I want to see if he has my sister and my eyes. I am going to spoil him by giving him whatever he wants.  He is my bundle of joy . You would think that he is my baby the way I am carrying on. Soon I will be Auntie Tal. I can hardly wait.

I pray that your spirit  not leave this place.

        As you remember I talk to a guy name Dwight. He is very nice guy that everyone likes him. But here is the thing he believe that we are moving to fast and I think that we are moving to slow. What is the deal with guys? Do they have a problem with commitment? I just don't understand. I know that I am fallen in love with him. But he always makes me question my thoughts. For example he told me that he was coming back to my house last night.  But he did not return until this afternoon at 2:00. Is that the kind of thing that i want to deal with or am I better off by myself. Every time I ask myself that question I come up with the answer, that I am better off with him than alone. Am I wrong?

      This is a poem that I wrote:   Little lady why do you cry? Is it because your heart is hollow or is it because the world has got you down?  Little lady don't let them see you down. Make sure you see tomorrow, and never, ever frown.  Don't let them steal your joy, and you will shine again. Life maybe hard and dirty, but i promise you will rise again.  Little women you are a soft flower, waiting eagerly to bloom. Let the world be your love and take you over  and you will be ready soon.

        I am not having a good life at this point in my life. I think that this is god teaching me a lesson. I am having the biggest financial problem that I ever had. My mother does not know but I really don't have the money to pay my bills. My mind is not in to school but I have to act like it is so I can get out. I am have so serious problems with my personal life. Why is it can not find love? I am losing my cool and I am giving up on love. I thought that I had found the one I would be with but he said that he is not interested. Am I not good enough for love? Do I look bad? Or is it that all of the things that I did in the past is catching up with me? What ever it is I can not take much more.

         This weekend was so boring I couldn't think. I had absolutely not think to do. Dwight and I have been spending a lot of time together, so naturally he would be with me. That is the way it went for the better part of the weekend. Then Sunday, the day of rest, came and all hell broke lose. I started out by doing Dwight hair. That took five damn hours. Then we went to his house so we could get him some cloths. Here it come the I am going to scream if I didn't do something more part. We went back to my house and low and behold we were bored again. This getting to be a pain in the butt. So I snapped, I got a attitude that you would not believe. I did not want to talk to anyone or see anyone for the whole night. It was one in the morning before I talk to Dwight again. See I am special; I know I need help.

           I went home this weekend to see my family and my friend. When I came home I also brought Dwight home with me.  I thought that it was going to be a bad idea because I don't bring people home that I hardly know.  But it turn out to be good. My  family liked him very much and my dad did not make himself look like a fool. On Friday when we got there we were to tired to do anything so we went to sleep. But on Saturday we ran the streets. Dwight and I started off by going to my friends house and staying with her most of the day. Then we went to my cousin house. Later on that evening we went to the movies and out to eat.  On Sunday we went to my friends house, my cousins house, and to my grandparents house. My granddad took us and the family out to eat. So as you can imagine we had a full weekend. But on Monday when we said our goodbyes is when I knew that they liked him . They hug him and invited him to come back. I was very pleases and I enjoyed my weekend.
