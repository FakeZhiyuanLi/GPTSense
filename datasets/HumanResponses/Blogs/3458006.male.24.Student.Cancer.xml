      Okay, maybe I'll start to take this seriously. Always happens that I start something and just dont bother using it. I'd say I've got accounts for this and that all over the web. Haha...  Sooo..., Whats hapening today then... My bro and one of my best mates are going to visit me in Lindau. Sweet. We are gonna be sooo pissed.    Background info: I am doing some work experience in Lindau, Germany. Have been here for about 5 months and will return to the Emerald Isle soon enough for my final year of college. Failed an exam so I'll be back a little sooner than I really wanted but sure, these things happen!       &nbsp;  I'll stick up some pics and I'm sure there will be a few tales to tell soon enough too!

      Damn, what a productive day. After yesterday when I did sfa I decided that, okay, youve only got 2 and a half weeks left, time to get the finger out. So this morning my boss detailed some testing that I should be carrying out. Which I have been doing untill now with no problems! Sweet. That was slightly unexpected on my part. As for memory effieciency (sp?), Im wasting about 1Kb which isnt bad but it isnt good either. Also, still have to do the report for college back home and, of course, study for my repeat exam. Sure, I'll be alright.  Ordered a 256Mb USB 2.0 stick from Komplett.de today also. Sweet. Hopefully it will arrive at the start of next week and then all the file transfering I have been strugling with will be a load easier. (What files I hear you ask... Well, mostly pics and that)

      So just a small post. My bro came over to visit me in Germany. Sweet! We had a great weekend. One of my best mates came also. My god, I havent been that pissed in a wee while. We went out one of the nights (cant even remeber which one). We started late and finished at maybe 5 in the morn. Great craic. And the German beer is just that bit stronger so we were well pissed. In work at the mo and bout to go for some grub so I guess I'll post later bout that crazy weekend. My mate is still here btw so more madness to come! Haha...
