      I just&nbsp;had chicken soup for my dinner. It was the cheap stuff for the coop so not very nice. Still things could be worse, my&nbsp;bestist friend has gone in to hospital today to have a rib removed, she should be going&nbsp;into the theatre right now so I am&nbsp;thinking of&nbsp;her. Its a well hot day. Talking of days, its nearly Friday! yippee!! I am looking forward to the weekend as I plan to buy some new clothes. My old ones are all too small, I'm getting incredibly fat. I'm 12 stone - the same as Nadia from big brother- and she's a man!! So I'm man sized grrr. &nbsp;&nbsp;   I've been looking at some other blogs and they all seem much more interesting than mine, in my defense I'm just getting into the swing of things.   This is short and sweet, I have to do some work, work is soooo inconvenient!!!

          Mondays are pants. Not only is the whole day in itself pant but it is proceeded with that niggling ‘its Sunday evening, the weekend is nearly over’ feeling where you try to prepare yourself for the week ahead and eek out the last milliseconds of free from the constraints of work time. Is it just me that finds it difficult to get to sleep on a Sunday? I have no idea why because I prepare for the next day with military precision, choose my clothes make my sandwiches and wash behind my ears. Still I feel uneasy.   I just love coming round on a Monday morning and enjoying those moments of confusion where you can’t figure out what day it is and what you are supposed to be doing.&nbsp;   Its safe to say I am not a morning person, I’d rather have teeth pulled than get out of bed in a morning, though I have been doing surprisingly well recently, waking at 6.20 and out of the house by 7.10. Perhaps getting up is an acquired skill that is easier to master with maturity.   Anyway back to my dislike of Mondays. On a Monday morning you are as far away from the end of the week as you will ever be. I like to begin my count down to the weekend on a Wednesday afternoon, the downward slope, the home straight to the finish post that is the weekends. You might think that my weekends are full of fun and frolicking – hell no, they are rather dull, though I do sometimes venture outside my front door to buy some bread or smokes.&nbsp; I know I need to get out more but I don’t have much of a disposable income or any friends to play with (Cue the violins). I don’t mind doing things by myself, in fact most of the time I am more than happy in my own company but there are times when the sadness of it hits you (and I mean that in both senses of the word).   &nbsp;  Enough.  &nbsp;In summation – Mondays are bad.

        Well this is my first post so it should be pretty exciting but the thing is ive been online for ages now and my pc is being very slow so i have lost my desire to blogg. im not really sure what i should write about. ive had a pretty dull day so far, weekends always are. i woke up at 9.30 and got some cornflakes and took them back to bed. after another snooze i had a hansome visitor bearing gifts of salmon and new potatoes (which were supposed to be for tea but i had scrambled eggs instead). i did my weekly bit of housework which invlove emptying bins at high speed, cleaning the loo (so satisfying) and washing up. i also hoovered but it always makes me feel sick for some reason. i then went to asda, i am on a budget (the cashpoint shouted insufficient funds at me last night) so i was restricted in my choices, i purchased cornflakes in a bag!! not a sign of great wealth. i've caught up on this week's big brother and slept a bit more. This evening i have been online looking at how to build a website, blogging and googling my name. im now ready for bed again so i think i'll hold it here and return another day.
