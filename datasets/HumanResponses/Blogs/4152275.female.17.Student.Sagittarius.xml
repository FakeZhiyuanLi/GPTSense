          Mood: drained, tired, wiped-out, mixed up, somewhat sick to my stomach.. you get the picture..  Okay so i meant to update this a loooonnnnggg time ago, but i keep forgetting.. or when i remeber I manage to not have anything to write about... so i have a couple things on my mind tonight.. lets begin.  So Market Mall opening is new expansion on August 11th. Ever since that dreaded day... our store has been non-stop busy.. its insane.. we're pulling in like $1300 a day.. and this time last year it was only around $800.. bah, so work has been awful, bottom line.  Wow, there almost only 2 weeks left before school, im scared... terrified really.. eep..  So a random impulse hit me yesterday while i was at work.. now we all now my last random impulse failed because the place was closed [who closes on a Wednesday?? like really!] .. but no, so i needed something to do on my break.. and so i randomly got the impulse to go pierce another part of my ear.. yeah didn't think it through or anything.. i just went... so $25 bucks later.. i now have a hole in the top part of my ear!!! yay! i've been waiting so long to do so. muhahahaha  Hmmm.. not really anything else new. I got to see the Butterfly Affect [do you realize it has 2 endings!], and I also go to see Robin Williams on Live Broadway.. omg, that man is hilarious. If you ever wanna win me over, go watch stand-up comedy with me.. thats one thing i could watch for hours and never get bored.. i absolutely adore it.  ah, so my friend Sam from Edmonton convinced me to get a nexopia page. if you ever wanna see it *as soon as i get it up and running of course* my user name is chellbee         arg, so being home is *fun* .. i think as soon as i turn 18 im gonna be a "party animal" and go out and party all night.. i mean that would be good. work, school and party... only come home to sleep.. hmmmmmmm what a contemplation  *sigh*  je veux m'endormir pour que je me r√©veille jamais  ah somedays, like today.. i think that would be nice... eternal rest.. no more reality for me. hmm *sigh* ....... ... . ah well, thats enough for tonight.  -Chellbee  -------------------

          Mood:  Meh, okay. [the title was a lil' marilyn manson if u didn't know =P]  Yeah, just okay. Today was a sucky day... i worked. I'm really thinking about quitting though, I'm tempted to go see what the pay is over at the World Health Club. Pros' with working there... its a 5 min walk from my house. Yes, I'm incredibally lazy... its a fact. well not really lazy, just tired of walking for an hour just 2 get to work... thats all.  bah, what else is up. Grand opening of Market Mall tomorrow.. lets all jump for joy! Haha, now there's going to be two parts to Market Mall.. the ghetto part, and the rich part... i swear... the new part puts the old part to shame... its so nice..  So another good movie to see is the Manchurian Candidate. awesome.. i love Denzel Washington.. awesome actor. It has a really good plot, some parts made me squeamish.. but oh well. It was good non the less.  Hmmm i think im going to go make some 'roni. haha, its almost 12 and i want supper... little late for that.. oh well.  Wow, i have nothing to say, unless i start rambling. but i won't. hmmm .. go here.  urlLink www.illwillpress.com  or better yet.  urlLink http://www.ebaumsworld.com/signs.html  your soul will enjoy it.  good night --Chellbee         *-* piece by piece, and bit by bit i'll break this down for you, real slow but i can't whisper all of this and i can't seem to let this go *-*

          Mood:  Feel Like Dancing! lol, weird considering i haven't slept properly in days.   Look, you stupid bastard. You've got no arms left"          no no, that was not a completely random quote.. read on.. you'll see  Arg, I remember why I liked geocities... for its simple, copy and edit routine.. Didn't have to go through the agony of HTML codes there... nope! oh well, I guess its worth it. Its gonna take me a while to figure it out... A wanna change my damn title.. its so boring!  So anyhow.. enough about the codes. what's been up lately? hmmm, not too much, Scott and Josh picked me up at 6am.. [yea, thats right...  6am! ] Saturday morning to try and go swimming again.. but the stupid winter club pool doesn't open till 9am on weekends So we went back to Scotts house and watched Pulp Fiction. It was a good movie, I just think I might have to rent it again because I missed most of it due to the fact I kept falling asleep. Hmmm, watch other movies were seen.. oh! Josh brought over Monty Python and The Holy Grail. Holy mother, its better than Army of Darkness, in the humor sense. hahahaha, it was great, completely random, really stupid and no plot what so ever. knowing me i'll probally go and buy it sooner or later, but ah.. i loved it! lol And I finally got to see Bowling for Columbine on Sat. night (or early Sunday morning i guess) . Awesome movie. Thats all that needs to be said. I  heart  Michael Moore. Still wanting to see Farenheit 9/11 though..  Work was a bore today.. it went by quickly though *thumbs up* Talked with Larissa alot, it only took a year for us to really talk.. haha, so today's topic was how guys are complete jerks, [this got started b/c some guy was playing her and this other girl] so it was interesting.. made work go by realllllyyyy fast.. so i guess it balances it out.  arg, im so tired.. i'm just waiting around for my whole system to crash one of these days.. oh well, there are so many better things to do than sleep.. like talk on..    MSN!!     haha.. yeah im a junkie and i know it. ah well, what can u do? haha thats right, absolutely nothing! muhahaha, Later! --Chellbee

         Wow! look how much easier this is... haha amazing.. So i got fed up with having to switch around my links for my own daily logg and decided that this was a much cooler way to go... =P lol, i dunno.. we'll see how this works out.. I mean i can copy and paste stuff directly on here.. so its looking better and better.....  Okay well first things first! I got back from my first vaction in 5 years, today. My family and I headed up to Radium for a couple days, it was awesome.. I learn't some things about myself that i never knew before.. such as I can pick locks!!!  muhahaha..  no need to be alarmed just yet.. I think it was really just a fluke.. So what happened was that my brother (being the dummy he is.. =P) went and locked the bottom part of our room door before we headed out the first night. We come back, and it wouldn't have been a problem if it wasn't for the fact that there was no key hole for the bottom lock... no there was only this tiny hole. So my mom starts freaking out and asks for my bobbypin and tries to pick the lock... She can't do it, so they start talking about what they should do. So while they were trying to think of a plan, i use my other bobbypin, and try to jiggle the lock open.. 2 seconds later, i hear a pop, and i swing the door open.. So thats my illegal entry story.. i'll have to try it again sometime and see if i'm just a natural.. lol Hmm what else, well radium was awesome, I absolutely adore the hotsprings there.. It'd be an awesome place to go for a road trip.. not that expensive. =) but oh man, you know your truly a city girl when, you get upset you have no reception.. lol it was a sad sad moment in time. oh well, thats enough for tonight. going out for a late night snack with T. mmmmmm french fries and chicken wings.. courteousy of earls.. lol Later! -chellbee
