      "Consider this a letter that I never sent, however inconsiderate it seems. Do you still consider me, consider me the boy you laughed with or that you learned to live without?" --Logan To Government Center - Brand New--  after a nice weekend off of writing, i'm back with more than ever (i hope)...  my weekend wasn't as bad as i thought it would be, but it could have been better.  it really sucks that tomorrow is the day of return to the Lincoln-Way Correctional Facility. my summer hiatus is finally over. i'm still waiting for the summer to begin, however.  in my world, i failed again on the topic discussed in all other posts. today, i saw her, and her eyes got all wide (you know what i'm talking about) and we could only manage to say 'hi' to each other. i'm becoming shy it seems, never thought this would happen.  well, in case you weren't sure, personally, i am for John Kerry this year -- my favorite Democratic candidate didn't win the primaries (Gen. Wesley Clark). however, i am not one of those that is on the extreme left (think Jesse Jackson), i am one that actually can say that i support a couple (quite literally a COUPLE) of the things that Republicans believe in. i just feel like i should've clarified that for every one...  i had band this morning bright and early. i feel like it was somewhat of a useless performance, but we do these little things for the community/teachers as a way to show them what we do.  that's all for this post, look later today for an addition -- i'm gonna put the lyrics to one of my songs in here.  bob

       do you want the truth??? i choked again...i'm sick of it...might as well give up. but if i give up, then "they" win, so i must keep pushing...      i hate my doctor (podiatrist, to be exact). well, i don't really hate my doctor, i just hate my damn feet. i have such bad problems with flattening that i have only a miniscule arch left -- on top of that, i have bad tendonitis in both feet. the result, no marching until next thursday. yesterday i had the most boring 4 hours of my life watching rehearsal. i think tuesday i'm gonna go onto the field...      today's my dad's birthday, and we're having a party for him and my brother (his is on the 15th). this is going to be boring, always is with the family over. i think i might need to get out somehow...      my cable modem was installed last night while i was at rehearsal, and at first i was like "cool, new technology..." now i'm like, "meh, it's still the same internet, just much faster and easier to get on without my parents caring..."      i'm hoping to tell her how i feel soon, i fear that if i wait like i usually do, i'll miss out on my chance -- again...      well, time to go for now, but i'm sure there'll be more later today...

       "since I replaced the I in live with an O, I can't remember who you are... ...but tomorrow I'll be you. just pick up the phone." --Thursday - Tomorrow I'll Be You --      so i woke up this morning around 7:30 and told myself to go back to sleep -- didn't happen. with the sound of light rain on the windows, i look outside to the gray sky and told myself that it's a new day. stumbling down the stairs with the still watery eyes, i remember that i choked again last night. why do i choke??? now, i don't mean that i have an eating problem or anything, i mean that i failed myself.       last night i had the intention of telling this one person my feelings towards her, and i just couldn't -- is that a good or bad sign, i don't know. so now i sit here trying to gather myself before i try again today -- wish me luck .       tomorrow will come, and i know that i've probably failed again, so the cycle begins yet again.
