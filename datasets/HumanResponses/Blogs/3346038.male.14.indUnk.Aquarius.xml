      i love the summer! summer is by far the best season, no doubt about it :)  and heres a list of my favourite foods to celebrate.  1. Chocolate - of course, what else would be number one!!!  2. Fondue - i adore this, especially in the winter, when its cold  3. Praline - mmmmmmmmm *dribbles*  4. Mushrooms in a creamy garlic sauce - preferably with alchol of some sort too lol  5. Pasta, with grated chedddar cheese and vinegar - yeah i know,  a little wierd, but its nice, you should try it one day  6. Brownies - nigella Lawsons chocolate brownies, fresh out of the oven, when the are still squidgy  7. Yorkshire puddings - have to be homemade ones, covered in mint sauce  8. Truffle tourte - just plain lovely!    lol i cant think of any more, good enough for now lol  have fun in the sun!

      The League of Extrodinary Gentlemen (excuse the spelling :P)  I watched this today, on box office  now i aint a critic, but on first impressions, it was BOLLOCKS! it had no plot, bad acting, bad screenplay . . . . i could go on.  nm there are better things to attend to . . . hey wait there isnt!  ill tell ye all a lil nice story instead;   Here is the elephant He is hapy with his balloon Oh No! It's gone! Is it behind the Rhino? no! Is it in the crocodile's mouth? It's not there either! Oh look, the monkey has it in the tree. He brings it back, They all drink lemonade The end   wonderful story from one of my fave shows, black books.

      Yay summers here at last!  crappy school today, another boring day of debates, graphs and presentations. one of my best friends, Amir, reall really pissed me off today, he like kept stealing my pencilcase and giving it back piece by piece. Everyone else finds this funny, he does it all the time, but i get really annoyed... i feel so lonely, everyone in school bullys me, even people i dont know, this morning, i tried to go though the main door but a load of townies blocked my way, when i asked could i get through they pushed me down the steps and tripped me up, saying go on then, hurry up! They somehow dont manage to get bored of this and do it every day. Im wary of them nowadays though, so they can never make me fall.  lonliness is horrid, trust me, i feel as though i have no friends. I really only have a few true friends that dont take my stuff, trip me up, call me smelly (all the time lol), call me willy (i am nbot amused), ditch me, put stuff down my back, draw on me, hit me or just plain bully me. I need some new friends lol! My best frined at the moment is probably Steve, he sticks up for me, and sits by me when everyone else wont.  the only thing keeping me going is the thought of Italy, next friday, i am going an a school trip to italy for 5 days, and i cant wait.

      this certainly is going to be a strange post . . .    i am feeling depressed these last few months, probably with growin up and all that, and bein lonely . . . noone likes lonliness.  to 'release my mind' on runescape, i have been counting, it really pisses people off, but it works, i counted all the way to 600 the other day, before i was persuaded to shut up. i have to say, it really did make me feel more calm, and cheered me up.  i also like to shout wierd things, or just be wierd, like fleeble!!!!!!! lolz, its kinda funny  writing this blog also really cheers me up :p  what the hell am i doing here?????????????????????????   will  also, i have a horrid cold, or virus or summat . . .

      last week, while i was on the school computers, making my profile image, my friends saw me go on my blog, so they might know what my username is now, which means they can read my blog. Now i dont want my mates to see this blog, it is where i write a lot of the stuff i dont want people to know, thats why i put it on the internet for all to see, (yea so logical i know!) But anyways, i will be so upset if they find it, i sorta trust them not to, but i aint so sure . . . If they do ever find this i can only hope they dont read all the important bits!   here is what i did this evening:  at four i went to jess's for the party, It was me, jess, gaz, Tom, and Nathan, who is big, we had a huge table full of crisps, dips, cakes, sandwiches . . . the normal stuff at parties. I ate far too much of the sweeter stuff lolz, cos i didnt really like the savoury stuff, then we played football and stuff in the garden. then we went inside and messed around in jess's rooms for ages, then we played on the ps2 before i went home about 930. yea, it wasnt that bad, but is really reminded me of that film 'meet the parents' cos i had never met jess's folks before, and they ahd tryed really hard to get vegetarian jelly and  sandwiches an all that, which i didnt eat cos i dont eat much. but i survived!  when i came home i watched 'the parole officer' is was very funny (wow its amazing how much you can write on one subject and how little on the other)  My mum bought me loads of expensive chocolate for doing well in a maths compotition i didnt even know i entered lolz, so tonight im gonna pig oout on it to get over how depressed i am after spending the evening with jess (cos you know, the whole " ive never had a girlfriend (shock horror!!!) and never will probably thing, and also cos i fancy jess), to put in one way,  jess wasnt at all making it any easier either. (id just like to point out now, that thinking about all the times ive described jess on this blog, she sounds like a slapper, but she aint, shes still a girl at heart, and i love her for it) I proably dont actually love jess, its jus me fancying her cos its the closest i have ever been to a girl (eww!!!! as a friend i mean, you dirty minded person!)   anyways,i think ive written enough for tonight (and the next 6 weeks) so g'night

      i have soo wanted an iPod for as long as i can remember, and my br has the 30Gb one, which is cool, but i couldn't really afford one. Around the time i decided i could get one and have enough money left over, the iPod Mini came out across the pond, and now me and my bro both want one!!!!! They are so wonderful! i cant wait till i get mine!!!!! unfortunately, they were supposed to be coming out in . . .  March, i think, then they were put back to April, then June, and now ive been told i cant get one till the end of July!!!!!!!!! Apple are soooooo eviiiiiiil. I want one now!  anyways, when, or if, they come out here lol, it wil be the happiest day of my life.   other news . . .  Hayfever season, bah, its the second worst time of the year (after winter (excluding christmas)) . i am as snuffly as hell and i cant stop sneezin  Big Brother . . . is back, and is as good as ever! im addicted already, People throwing plates at walls, topless womens mud wrestling, People havin food fights,  what could be more entertaining?!?!?!?!  I found out just the other day, that Fred Durst himself has a blog! its the funniset blog i have ever read, he is so dumb lolz. one line caught my eye; 'we are going round in circles as we continue along this path towards terrorists . . .' or something like that. The bit about circles,a dn along paths, does taht make ant sense at all??? i think not . . . . . . I dont know the web address but if you go on google, the search for American alien Fred Durst, you'll end up on it :0  heh heh were movin house too, probably wont be for a few weeks yet . . . but there will probably be a large gap in my posts, as i will be workin my arse off.

      friday is usually the best day of the week for me, you know, beginning of the weekend and all that. i like to sit and watch telly, then come play computer games till the early hours :P Today, though, my folks had friends round and they went in the front room so i had to watch TV on my crappy little thing! then ny Grandad in law got rushed to hospital. i am in no way moved by it though, cos i never really liked him, and its nothing serious anyway.  what i need is a good friend . . . someone who actually listens to me, talks to me, supports me, is there when i need them. i dont really have and friends like that nowadays :( Even better would be a girlfriend, but we all know that aint never going to happen!  A friend thats a girl (subtle difference) i would like i suppose, as long as  i dont fancy them when i clearly have no chance.  hehe i have one whole project to do for school tomorrow (oh wait its tomorrow now lolz) i aint lookin forward to it

      here are two things that i though were good, so i stole them off a friends blog, the generous thief (wonderful name!)    Genesis Revised   In The Beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth. And the Earth was without form, and void, And darkness was upon the face of the deep.   And the Devil said, "It doesn't get any better than this."   And so God created Man in His own image; Male and female He created them.   And God looked upon Man and Woman And saw that they were lean and fit. And God populated the earth With broccoli and cauliflower and spinach and green and yellow vegetables of all kinds, So Man and Woman would live long and healthy lives.   And so the Devil created McDonald's. And McDonald's brought forth the 79-cent double cheeseburger. And the Devil said to Man, "You want fries with that?"   And Man said, "Super size them." And Man gained five pounds.   And so God created the healthful yogurt, That Woman might keep her figure. But the Devil brought forth chocolate. And Woman gained five pounds.   And God said, "Try my crispy fresh salad." And the Devil brought forth Ben and Jerry's. And Woman gained 10 pounds.   And God said, "Why doth thou eatest thus? I have sent thee heart-healthy vegetables And olive oil with which to cook them."   But the Devil brought forth chicken fried steak So big it needed its own platter. And Man gained 10 pounds And his bad cholesterol went through the roof.   And so God brought forth running shoes. And Man resolved to lose those extra pounds.   And the Devil brought forth cable TV with remote control So Man would not have to toil to change channels between OMNI1 and OMNI2. And Man gained another 20 pounds.   And so God brought forth the potato, A vegetable naturally low in fat and brimming with nutrition.   And the Devil peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy center into chips and deep-fat fried them. And the Devil created sour cream dip.   And Man clutched his remote control And ate the potato chips swaddled in cholesterol.   And the Devil saw this and said, "It is good."   And Man went into cardiac arrest. And God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.   And the Devil cancelled Man's health insurance.   So God showed Woman how to peel the skin off chicken. And cook the nourishing whole grain brown rice. And the Devil created light beer So Man could poison his body, While feeling righteous because he had to drink twice as much of the now-insipid brew to get the same buzz. And Man gained another 10 pounds.   And Woman ventured forth Into the land of Godiva chocolate, And upon returning asked Man, "Do I look fat?"   And the Devil said, "Always tell the truth."   And Man did.   And Woman went out from the presence of Man And dwelt in the land of the divorce lawyer, East of the marriage counselor.   And the Devil said, "It doesn't get any better than this!"

      yay im home!  its so nice to be sleepin in my own bed at last, an eatin nice food, and usin the computer *hugs computer* oh how ive missed it lol.  Italy was . . . OK . . . we were stayin in this crappy (only 2 stars!) hotel in the middle of Sorrento town, with four people to each room, an it was very cramped and boring.   the food at the hotel was pretty disgusting, mainly cos im vegetarian, so when the others had meat we jus had a plate of vegetables, literally.  The day trips werent so bad though, especially goin up vesuvius.   The people were so depressing though, cos they seemed to want to ignore me all the time, so i spent most of my time alone. My best friend on the trip, Amir, even ditched us. He refused to sit with us and went to sit with the cool people, who we all would have sat with if we thought we were welcome, claiming he wanted to sit with "good people"!!!!!!!!!!! i mean c'mon! hes such a wanker sometimes. The cool people dont even like him for gods sake!  And after this trip, i fully dont understand girls, or at least one of them. Annie, who is fancied by pretty much everyone in the whole year, was like sitting next to the wierdest person there (which surprisingly isnt me) called Luke, he is really fat and ugly, he has no style (crop trousers with long socks?????) and isnt even particulary kind! What the hell dya have to do to be liked!!!!!!!!!!!  anyways, im gonna forget about all the bad bits, im home now.

      i thought id write a lil bit about my friends, jus cos i feel like it!  i kinda have 3 groups of friends, the 'outcasts', the runescapers, and the cool people. the outcasts are my main group of friends, the runescapers includes a very old friend, and we basically just talk about RS all the time, i am not fully accepted with this group, the cool people are Gaz, Tom, and Jess, again, i am not fully accepted with this group either.  the group i like to think of as the outcasts,is made up of, as suggested, social outcasts like me, or thats how i see it, a group of lost souls, gathering to console each other. (lol) here is a list of them, and a frank (but true) description of why they are outcasted  Amir: Fat and wierd, possibly gay Ash: even fatter, and he smells John: fat, and very shy, thats probably why he doesnt have many friends Les: Ginger, he like cycling and fishing Vicente: very very clever, though probably not as much as me (ya ya i know), he got moved up a yeay because of this, up to our year i mean Steve: addicted to GameCube and computer games James: shy, i dunno, hes actually quite popular . . . nathan, like taller than all of us, and he thinks hes cool, he hangs out with cool people thinking they like him (( that aint jealousy, i know they dont (hes also good friends with jess)) me and steve have a lot of jokes about him trying to be cool lol) i could go for ages about this, cos it really pisses me off, but yea. Me: nerdy, foureyed, wierd music boy   wow, im so boring!!!!!!!! i write about the most boring stuff in the world!!!!!!!!!!!

      ive been doing a lot of thinking lately, and ive come up with a mental list of all the bad things about me that people sometimes take the piss out off me for. I am sometimes known as . . .  The boy who has a wierd taste in music. The boy who you can ask for answers if you're stuck at school. The boy who has old people hands (or OPH for short (this is beacause i have bad eczema, and people don't think about my feelings before saying things like that)) The boy who you can barge into in the corridors for no reason. The boy who is really ugly and will never get a girlfriend. The boy who gets picked last in every sport we play in PE. (not that i care) The boy who has huge square glasses. (they aint that big!) The boy who's hair sticks up at the back. The boy who you can harry potter for no reason, even though he doesn't have floppy hair and a scar The boy who has to get girls to stand up for him. (Aww c'mon!) The boy who eats wierd things (mainly cos im a vege, but also i dont eat much) The boy who gets a 1/A for every piece of work The boy who never does anything bad The boy who spends all his time on the computer. The boy who wears really uncool clothes. The boy who goes to bed at 6 (har har) The boy who shouts wierd stuff at people (but it's fun!) The boy who never goes out places. The boy who  . . . oh i dunno . . .   but anyways, thats all i can think of. Im gonna shut up with all the depression alk now, ive been talkin bout it for ages, and even im getting bored of it.   te he he

      right, heres the deal;  we have bought our new house, which is called thistledown, it is in a place called penrhynside. but we have not properly moved in yet. most of our stuff is there, in the garage, and various sheds, but we are not. we are going to have all new stone flooring put down, and were painting the whole house white, so it would be foolish to move in just yet. right, my grandparents bought a house, then built a bigger house in the garden, which is what we are gonna do eventualy in thistledown, and they live in the big house, while were livin in the lil house for the next 3 weeks, in 3 weeks we go to france forr a week, then we will move in properly when we get back. I am sooooooooooooooo tired lately, thistledown needs a helluva lot of work.  also, i aint gonna get to post much as the only computer access i have is via my cousins pc, which isnt a mac!!!!!!, who lives with my gradparents . . its a long story.    sigh

      our family never seems to be able to have a holiday without having to visit the doctor of the hospital - literally - and france was no exception  when we were bouldering in the forest i climbed up a big rock, probably about 4 metres high, and i had been jumping between rocks and stuff all day, so i wasnt scared, i decided to jump to another rock below me which looked about a metre below me, but when i was in the air i realised it was bigger, and it was about a 3 metre drop to the other rock. by then i couldnt not jump lol so i hit the deck and kinda crushed my feet.  lol we had to go to hospital and i had to get crutches, nothing broke, but it feels like it. that was about a week ago, and it still hurts and i still have to use crutches :P  i think i learned my lesson, still, it was fun before i landed though!
