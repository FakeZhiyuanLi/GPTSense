      the only way i'll be able to make this work is by jumping write in. get it? normally, i'm not that lame, but i couldn't resist. okay. as we're just getting to know one another, sometimes i'm that lame. fine. in an effort for complete honesty at the beginning of this relationship, a lot of times i'm a bit lame. i like to think of it as sort of a post-modernist lameness. i know i'm being lame therefore it's actually funny.  shut up. if you want this weblog to work you're going to have to learn to love it.  for my second-ever entry i'd like to take a moment to think on the meaning of punctuation. i don't like it. period. (bah dum dum-last one, i promise)this new book, eats, shoots and leaves, is sweeping the country and i find this disturbing. i've always had a diversive opinion on punctuation, i find that most of it is extraneous and the colon is entirely pretensious. but, this book is making it POPULAR to punctuate protectly. POPULAR. what is wrong with people? language evolves, it doesn't stagnate. all this emphasis on punctuation is only going to drag us back in the language quagmire and stunt out growth out, way out, of the depths of unnecessary characters to say what we mean.   and not to disturb anyone to deeply, but apparently there's something called "the apostrophe protection society". i'm not sure what that means exactly, but i think they come to your house and glare at you if you "misuse" an apostrophe.  who the hell cares? these people need to get a life. in business i can understand the importance of correct punctuation to insinuate an intelligence most business people don't acutally have, but this might be going overboard. obviously, i hate capital letters. i find they break the flow and don't matter in what i'm trying to say. so i don't use them. but, i do at work. because i'm a sell-out and i want the people i work with to believe i'm not quite that subversive/i don't want to get in a lengthy discussion about why i don't like capitals. maybe i should start an anti-capital brigade. we'll remove the caps lock from computers and stage rallys rallying against the unnecessary capital letter. after that perhaps i can take on teenages calling you ma'am when you're under 25.   projects for the future.  i think i was right. jumping right in, even with rant, was a good idea.  stay tuned. they're be more tomorrow.  until next time,  i'm still twirling, lm out
