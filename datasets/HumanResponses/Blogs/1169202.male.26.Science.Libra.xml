      Tom - sorry to hear about your arm - hope you get well soon.&nbsp; I don't think e-mail updates are that necessary - the postings are sporadic and I certainly check here every now and again to see if something happens.  So let's talk Ulysses for a bit.&nbsp; Or maybe not.&nbsp; You see,&nbsp; here is what happens to me in summer.&nbsp; I have projects that need to be accomplished - an article, a book - and I do all I can to get sidetracked.&nbsp; At the moment it is Mary Stuart's biography that took me to another time and place (I figure, Scotland isn't that far off, at least I stayed in the vincinity geographically speaking).&nbsp; But I almost finished this 400 pager.&nbsp; Its guilty pleasure, I know, and I fear that the interruption might mean that I have to leaf through the couple of hundred Ulysses pages again to fresh up my memory.  What has stuck?&nbsp; Unbelievable one liners: 'Israel, the gray sunken cunt of the world' ... some remarkable imagery - the barrels rolling around in the head leaking porter into the brain - &nbsp;Bloom's biting pondering on religion, its role, its shortcomings.&nbsp; His attack on the catholic church (easy target, tho).&nbsp; The care and subtelty of the plot construction: Bloom going to a Turkish Bathhouse before going to the graveyard.&nbsp; The soap for Molly - the careful braiding here of sex and death (oh yes, very late goth romantic - I should know, since I am also being sidetracked by Baudelaire's Fleurs du mal)  On a discoursive level this book is really a treat:&nbsp; I do not think I have ever encountered another narrative style that has me so utterly engrossed in the complex flux of consciousness.&nbsp; I gave it some thought and I am convinced that people can and do think of themselves at times in the third person.&nbsp; SO the oscillation between a first and third person narrative is remarkably astute.&nbsp; I am just not certain yet, whether we are dealing with one specific character's flux of consciousness, or whether it is a communal, 'supra' consciousness, a kind of 'supra' omniscient narrator, who not only knows his characters and conveys their motivations, emotions and thoughts, but manages to actually record them.&nbsp; Curious to continue reading...  Oh and there is another beautiful quotation I ran across:&nbsp; 'but Brutus is an honorable man', page 73.&nbsp; One of my favourite speeches - you tell me where from.

      Is everyone checking the comments links below each post?&nbsp; It's probably stating the obvious but I would hate for anybody to miss the good stuff being said.&nbsp; They're easy to miss.&nbsp; Just below the post it says in little blue letters "1 comment" etc.&nbsp; Does any one get email when a comment is posted?&nbsp; I do, but I'm not sure if it's because I created the blog.&nbsp; Let me know.  Chris

      Thomas, I agree with you on that last comment about the mixture of different times/thoughts in a dialogue.&nbsp; The narration forces you to read into a sentence independently because of such heavy fragmentation. I have to assume that this is intentional, but for first time readers it is hard not to just take fragments and enjoy them on their own, for their own sake.&nbsp; I don't think this is so bad, but I'm often left with a feeling or reaction that comes more from my own life than from blooms.&nbsp; On a personal (subjective) level this is really incredible, but, well, maybe it can be read best on such a level, personal.&nbsp; I mean,   "The nails, yes.&nbsp; Is there anything more in him that they she sees?&nbsp; Fascination.&nbsp; Worst man in Dublin.&nbsp; That keeps him alive.&nbsp; They sometimes feel what a person is.&nbsp; Instinct.&nbsp; But a type like that.&nbsp; My nails.&nbsp; I am just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone.&nbsp; Body getting a bit softy.&nbsp; I would notice that from remembering." pg 92   I can't help thinking of Proust and his madeleine or that bit of music that triggers pages and pages of memory.&nbsp; But with Bloom we have fingernails and all revolves around the minute unapologetically.&nbsp; Bloom's relation to memory is noticed only because the past is a stark contrast to his current state (I think he's just noticing his age).&nbsp; He's sort of measuring his life by the growth of his fingernails.&nbsp; But then he's looking at his hands and talking about nails and so you get on to thinking about christ.&nbsp; But just as easily you don't because they are just fingernails, and there is not really a reason (yet, maybe there will be) to start making those kinds of jumps in the texts.&nbsp; This is what I mean about the temptation to read to far into it, but sometimes I feel forced to.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Does anyone have any thoughts on early punctuation irregularities.&nbsp; The first missing period I noticed is on my page 82  &nbsp;  "Queer the whole atmosphere of the.&nbsp; Quite right.&nbsp; Perfectly right that is (end of sentence) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Bloom looked back..."&nbsp;  &nbsp; It must be&nbsp;because of inner-dialogue, and I've seen how the book ends with molly, but this single lack of a period seems to call out.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; OK, more reading, more reading.   OH Chente, I'm wondering what it is you had to say on the "I"   Chris

      dublin? yeah, must be the plot's place i heard.  i finally did it, starting to enter the scene as reader. the people there and even more the narrator gave me a quite hard time - especially having the parallel interferences of tolstoj's straight descriptions in my mind. phuh! (please excuse my weak english in talking about stuff i read, i try my best to describe what i think about what i read and notice.)  i didn't see much of it all yet, but i feel able to answer andrea's question about this jesuit. isn't it stephen daedalus aka kinch who was called jesuit several times by buck mulligan? and the one who gave him a hard time at night must be haines, the english guy.  i didn't go very far yet. i think we just said goodbye to the milk woman. i'm not quite sure if i already noticed the shifting of narrator: it seems to me as if at points of the dialogues the narration fades into descriptions of the things actually talked about that go very very far or said in other words: they are very abstract to me, like a mixture of past events and their respective explanations connected with some colourful language here, pointing at situational feelings there. i didn't go into them very detailed so far, because of more concentrating on the ongoing plot. i needed some time until i got some image of the setting. this is something i missed a little at the very beginning. but the sight is getting clearer. right now i'm wainting for mr. bloom to enter the stage - i heard that he is supposed to be the main character... well...

      dear christopher, dear others,  first off: nice too "meet" all of you.  i just want to respond to christopher's technical question about the message board quickly. unfortunately i couldn't start getting into "ulysses" yet as i wasn't able to distract myself from tolstoj's "war and peace". but that's no question here. i will get into the things of matter within the next days and try to catch up. in the meantime i'll try to follow your discussions - as i'm on vacation for another 2 weeks i will only be able to do that sporadically. however, i will watch by every now and then! o.k., the message board: i only set one up once without really being an expert in things like that. but there are websites making this possible and they are really easy to handle. i would do it immediately, but my internet-connection is very restricted here. so, christopher, i'd suggest you should look at www.blogger.com and register a ulysses-message board for us - it should work for our purpose, i think!  sorry for this unpersonal introduction full of excuses and topics that don't concern our chosen point of interest.  i'm looking forward to putting myself into other terms here.  best wishes thomas

      Andrea, sorry for the delayed response, I was out of town for the past two weeks.  I've added some friends on the email list who are down for the challenge.  Everyone, meet Itza (hotdamn105@...), Phil (chente@...), and Thomas (t.kreiml@...).  Good people every one.  Diving right in...  I think what strikes me so far is the way characters' narratives shift so fluidly.  As you said, Andrea, the "I" is almost untraceable.  The narrative internalizes and then goes third person without a blink.  Mulligan's references to uebermensch and Zarathustra (pg. 22, 23) seem to me direct allusions to Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra.  The last few pages of the first chapter seems especially dionysian to me.  Also, when Dedalus says to Mr. Deasy " History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake" (34) I think of Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals, and even some of Yeats (does anyone else think so?).  And yes, that scene on the beach is incredible.  I'd like to hear some more thoughts on that.  When Bloom enters, the 1st/3rd person seems to be blurred even more.  It is really incredible the way Joyce mingles the thoughts(?) of the cat and Bloom into a sort of dance between them.  Language seems to crumble when the car says, "Mkgnoa" and "Prr.  Scratch my head. Prr." (55).  But then Bloom and the cat understand each other perfectly, don't they?  Bloom even says, "They call them stupid.  They understand what we say better than we understand them. She understands all she wants to."  The other thing that strikes me about the Bloom section (chapter 2) is the music that seems to be driving Bloom's inner-dialogue.  Things like "Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically.  Walk along a strand, a strange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old Tweety's big mustaches....  Wander through awned streets" (57).  The sound of each sentence is beautiful.  The placement of words even seems to have some esoteric double meaning (ex. putting "a strand, a strange land" together as if there is some connection between them). It kill me how natural it sounds, it seems effortless.  Those are my initial thoughts so far.  I think these things are pretty minute, but so far a greater picture has not been made clear to me (haha, the big joke: is it ever?).  Chris Perreira

      I apologize for the silent fortnight  closing up shop in LA kept me very busy.  Unfortunately, reading could not part of my schedule.  But now, back in Europe and within reach of my bookshelf I was able to start Ulysses.  So here are some of my first (and jetlagged) ruminations: As usual, please argue with me!  I met Buck Mulligan and Kinch aka Stephen Daedalus.  I met Haines and the milk woman.  I met Daedalus boss, too.  Not quite clear who the Jesuit is in the opening pages  the one that scared SD the night before.  Any ideas?  Uncertainty seems to be the method.  The constant shifts of narrator are much more confusing than what we had in any of our novels.  Joyce fades into inner monologue of various characters without indications, the Is are plenty and then, poof, back to a third person.  We have an omniscient narrator for half a line and a most intimate first person narrator for the rest of the sentence. That is quite confusing.  But I think once his reader gets the hang of this method it will prove to be quite an interesting and rich device.  Particularly beautiful seems the last third of Chapter One, which starts Ineluctable Modality of the Visible.  All that happens is Daedalus taking a walk after he got paid  but my, what an intimate look at the creative process of a writer.  This is a brain going at a hundred miles an hour  not unlike Proust - it is hard to even describe what exactly is done here  but somehow these pages contain the fleeting thought process of a creative mind which might (or might not) lead to some scribbling down on a note pad.   Have you noticed any interlacing of quotes?  We are obviously dealing with some seriously literate characters  I found a few bits and pieces, as e.g. the blatant Walt Whitman quote on (my) page 17:  Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself!  Grateful for any more hints  I am sure there are many!  So Chapter one has three scenes:  The Tower, Daedalus at his school and Daedalus at the beach.  The weaving of notions (is it notions?) and concepts is intriguing:  Mothers and the Sea, (the Sea as Mother and later as Father on p. 50 Old father Sea).  Women dont get much of a break so far  and neither do Jews.  I shall pay attention to the development of sin and life (as in meaning of and perpetuation of) as the novel progresses.  And since we have a classic three part (act?) structure to our heros journey, it should prove to be quite interesting how these fundamental themes unfold.  With Molly and Leopold Bloom, this surely has to change!  What do we think of the language, particularly the use of so many?  (Latin, French, German, English and its various dialects)  What does this tell us about these characters?  There education, their social background?  Ok, enough for today.  We should, perhaps, discuss some technical aspects: message boards and editionsI am reading the vintage edition of 1990.  Looking forward to thoughts from everyone.
