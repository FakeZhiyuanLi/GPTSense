      Well, it's been a busy week. And yet I still have the feeling that I've gotten nothing done. Monday I helped my friend Dave move some furniture he had been given: a coffee table, a bed, and an entertainment center. That all went fine.  But then we returned the pickup truck he had borrowed from a co-worker. I never got the fellow's name, but he was nice enough to have cleaned Dave's car for him while we were moving the furniture. Anyway, we parked the truck and then walked up to get Dave's car. On the way we were stopped by a couple of police officers in an unmarked car.  The police informed us that two white kids only came to that part of town for two reasons, either to sell drugs or buy drugs. This was outrageous. Apparently we had been stopped because we were  walking down the street  in the wrong part of town. As it turns out, Dave's co-worker did have a warrant out on him (for what, I canot say) so he was arrested. Dave and I were finally let go on our way, but not before being frisked and I'll go ahead and say it, harassed by the police (I'm sure they were sure we were there for a drug deal).  Sigh...  The rest of my free time this week has been taken up playing  urlLink Madden 2005  -- if not the best football video game ever, it's certainly the best football video game franchise ever.

      I don't seem to have enough of it. Time. I'm single, I have few responsibilities and I'm young. But somehow I never seem to have enough time. Working, sleeping, reading, watching movies, writing. And then there's constant interuptions from  other people !

      Well, the vacation is over and it's back to work at the little piece of heaven that is the video store I am an assistant manager at. I spent most of the day waiting for customers to arrive -- few did. Oh well, they usually only rent bad movies anyway...  The Guardian has posted an interesting extract from Tom Hodgkinson's book,  How To Be Idle ,  urlLink here . I don't agree with all of his assertions, but I wonder if there's anything to our modern idea of a "job" stemming from the industrial revolution.  The Matrix  captivated audiences by showing us a future world where man was ruled both physically and mentally by machines. That is science fiction, but often "real-life" applies fictions in much more subtle forms. Are we becoming enslaved to our inventions? By creating a system in which we rely so heavily on new technology, we, in a way, become enslaved to the system and the technology. This isn't a new observation, and I'm sure plenty of people would dismiss it out of hand, but I think it bears some consideration.  A quote from G. K. Chesterton:  "If somebody says: 'A rickety cradle may mean a rickety baby,' the natural deduction, one would think, would be to give the people a good cradle, or give them money enough to buy one.  But that means higher wages and greater equalisation of wealth; and the plutocratic scientist, with a slightly troubled expression, turns his eyes and pince-nez in another direction.  Reduced to brutal terms of truth, his difficulty is this and simply this: More food, leisure, and money for the workman would mean a better workman, better even from the point of view of anyone for whom he worked.  But more food, leisure, and money would also mean a more independent workman.  A house with a decent fire and a full pantry would be a better house to make a chair or mend a clock in, even from the customer's point of view, than a hovel with a leaky roof and a cold hearth.  But a house with a decent fire and a full pantry would also be a better house in which to refuse to make a chair or mend a clock--a much better house to do nothing in--and doing nothing is sometimes one of the highest of the duties of man."
