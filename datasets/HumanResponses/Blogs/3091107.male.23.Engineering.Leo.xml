       This is probably my favorite poem, and always grounds me when I need it, for I am one of Martha's Sons.  The Sons of Martha The Sons of Mary seldom bother, for they have inherited that good part;  But the Sons of Martha favour their Mother of the careful soul and troubled heart.  And because she lost her temper once, and because she was rude to the Lord her Guest,  Her Sons must wait upon Mary's Sons, world without end, reprieve, or rest.  It is their care in all the ages to take the buffet and cushion the shock.  It is their care that the gear engages; it is their care that the switches lock.  It is their care that the wheels run truly; it is their care to embark and entrain,  Tally, transport, and deliver duly the Sons of Mary by land and main.   They say to mountains, 'Be ye removed'. They say to the lesser floods, 'Be dry'. Under their rods are the rocks reproved - they are not afraid of that which is high.  Then do the hill-tops shake to the summit - then is the bed of the deep laid bare,  That the Sons of Mary may overcome it, pleasantly sleeping and unaware.   They finger death at their gloves' end where they piece and repiece the living wires.  He rears against the gates they tend: they feed him hungry behind their fires.  Early at dawn, ere men see clear, they stumble into his terrible stall,  And hale him forth like a haltered steer, and goad and turn him till evenfall.   To these from birth is Belief forbidden; from these till death is Relief afar.  They are concerned with matter hidden - under the earthline their altars are;  The secret fountains to follow up, waters withdrawn to restore to the mouth,  And gather the floods as in a cup, and pour them again at a city drouth.   They do not preach that their God will rouse them a little before the nuts work loose.  They do not teach that His Pity allows them to leave their work when they damn-well choose.  As in the thronged and the lighted ways, so in the dark and the desert they stand.  Wary and watchful all their days that their brethren's days may be long in the land.   Raise ye the stone or cleave the wood to make a path more fair or flat:  Lo, it is black already with blood some Son of Martha spilled for that:  Not as a ladder from earth to Heaven, not as a witness to any creed,  But simple service simply given to his own kind in their common need.   And the Sons of Mary smile and are blessed - they know the angels are on their side.  They know in them is the Grace confessed, and for them are the Mercies multiplied.  They sit at the Feet - they hear the Word - they see how truly the Promise Runs:  They have cast their burden upon the Lord, and - the Lord He lays it on Martha's Sons.   Rudyard Kipling

       The shelf continues, I am now one cut away from finishing construction, and a whole heck of a lot more sanding to go.  No pictures yet, although I discovered and innovative way to add fiber to your diet.  Sand in an enclosed area without a mask or ventilation.... You can just feel the grinding on your mucus membranes MMmmm mmmm Piney.  Canada's Wonderland this Saturday, just have to make it through a brutal day of work, I can just feel the bad karma.  PS if google minions are scanning my blog, I LOVE gmail!!!!  Just a nice clean interface, and definitly inovative with the labels.

       Sorry for the long silence oh viewers of my blog. Its just I've been really busy on a personal project.  It is not that exciting, but I am enjoying it.  I am building a shelf ooooo ahhhh.  Okay its a nice shelf, about 1.85mx1.0mx0.3m, solid pine, with a milled trim at the bottom and just some plane trim all the way around.  I have it about 90% constructed, all that is left is to attach the trim and the last panel on the back (which needs to be trimmed to fit.)  Then I need to stain it, which I hope to do Sunday.  I will have pictures up this weekend I hope.    Now one might ask what the big deal is, its a shelf I can buy one at Ikea for $40.  Well its not some crap Ikea laminated particle board crap.  To purchase a good shelf like this unfinished would be over $200 and I am going to pull it off for just about half that.  This is not what its about, while inexpensive quality furniture is good.  My real motivation here is software engineering.  WHAT? You say, well first off I am a software engineer, a real engineer, not a pretend one (that is a rant for another day.)  In reality I am a bit flipper, I sit day in and day out orchestrating a vast amount of ether to produce software magic.  At the end of the day/project/life I really have done a lot and have nothing to show, except maybe a CD, but I didn't make the CD, I just made the content, it just doesn't feel as good as good honest labour.  So every once in a while I am overcome with a urge to create, and until I build something solid and real with my own to hands (and a little bit of blood, sweat and pride for good measure,) its a thirst that just can not be slaked.  So that is the purpose of this project, and it is my most ambitious to date, and it is going really well.  I hope in fact to build my own desk next year when I move into my house, but one project at a time.  I will post some pictures this weekend.  That and I will try and blog more.  Cheers

       What is the medical purpose of this process?  Are Dr. Trying to determine how agile your testicles are?  Is it a cruel joke?  Or is there some darker purpose a foot, perhaps a plan to take over the world??????  That aside, had a physical today, got called fat, well no shit Sherlock.  But here is a number to hit it home... For my age/gender/weight/height I have a 240% higher chance of a heart attack then a person of equal age/gender/height (but a healthy weight.)  Sadly that weight is about 100 lbs away... So lets take it 1 lb at a time, and avoid premature death.... YEAH NOT DIEING (I am serious about that!)

       Currently reading a little Orcon Scott Card, always a favorite, I will speak more on this when I am done, but at the moment I would like to say that this book is really really accessible.  I mean you need to have read the others in the series which I have, but I haven't read them in a good 1-2 years, so I was completely out of touch with the characters, but I just picked this up and BOOM I am back into it.  Good on you Card.    More to follow when I am done the book.  Cheers

       Okay, okay, so I didn't get back to my comments on this as fast as I would have liked, and like most stories, the true impression is fleeting... So as it has been a few days and almost and entire book in between I have some loose impressions.  On the whole great book, good warm up in the first period, I liked the whole three religion thing, especially how Pi used religion to shush the religiosos.    As for the second part, just a good yarn, filled with (what I feel,) was a good window into the human soul at its most honest.  Like really in all the stories human vs human seems so puny and pity compared to human vs nature.  Its so visceral, just makes life so alive.  Third part gave me the willies...  I'm with Pi on that one, his version was better.    In any case, I'm no book critic I just know what I like and I liked it.  I also like Ed Greenwood, mostly out of loyalty, because in my literary infancy he seemed like a god, not so really, more like playdough through a mold, but he still holds me to a story once in a while, but he is off my hard cover list.

       First off I just made the logo, what do you think?  I realize it isn't a masterpiece; in fact I used another image as a stencil to create the silhouette.  So very little of my own creative juices were employed, other then the initial spark that said "I am looking for X."  That aside I wanted to lay down some ground rules, sort of, more like what one can expect from me as the blogger, and as anyone who may or may not be reading this.   1.  I will post when I post, this place could go dry for 3 months, and then meet with 3 posts an hour... It’s just my nature to be ride up and down on the waves of interest. 2.  I will write what I damn well feel like, so if I am saying to much or too little on a subject or how I feel, you are more then welcome to ask for more, or less, but under no circumstances will I feel obligated to change or respond, but I will try. 3.  I won't talk about work, or the people I work with, this is more a concern that the place I work is very sensitive about corporate image, and I wish to keep my job and a healthy relationship with my coworkers, so I am not going to bitch, gripe, or make comments about them, or my companies decisions, the most you might get out of me is something like "I had a good day at work."  Or "Today sucked." 4.  Self-expression, please feel free to respond to any thing I write with anything you feel like, but I am going to say it right here and now, I will censor things I deem inappropriate, or just out and out delete them.  I admit to occasionally having spats of verbal diarrhoea that would make a sailor blush, and I am embarrassed by them, my personal feeling is that anything that can be said with curses can be said more eloquently and equally expressively with out being offensive... That being said, I am not a prude, and I am sure a few dirty words will slip in, just don't go to far. 5.  A follow up on 4, "ism's" will NOT be tolerated, no racial slurs, no I hate this group, I have that group, kill them, burn that etc.  You want to debate politics okay fine, you want to talk about what group you want to ethnically cleanse, take it some where else.  I have no stomach for it. 6.  If you are someone I know, and I say something about you, and you just really don't want that being said, tell me and I will take it down. 7.  Personal information, I really don't feel that their is a lot of privacy left out their, but at the same time I'm not going to give away to many personally specifics, dammit if you want to steal my identify you will have to root through my garbage. 8.  Enjoy, or don't its your call!  Cheers (note I am notorious for both stealing peoples sayings and implanting my own in other peoples speech patterns, no offence intended, if it sounds good to my ear I keep it.)

       If games were real life, I could respawn, but according to my brother Alex, I can rocket jump...  Or at least jump using some sort of mine, or small explosive device.  Without going heavily into the physics of explosives, which I am sure the google searches and this blog post will paint me up and down the world as a crazy nutt job terrorist.  The truth remains that year after year people have limbs removed by said devices, more often then being flung 2-4 meters into the air.    The problem I'm sure revolves around how the energy is dispersed, that in fact there is not enough energy in a small bomb to launch you, but there is enough energy to launch a piece of the bomb through you.  In the event that there is enough energy to move you, that energy is expanding  in a compression shock wave and isn't only going to move your feet, its going to move through your whole body, because the shock wave is probably traveling a lot faster then the human body can be safely accelerate to in time, turning human into liquid goo.  I will try and add more to this as I find out, if I care to, but suffice it to say, people can't rocket jump.

       What a night, well I hope none of my brothers friends are reading this, because then I will be in trouble, but Erin (my fiance,) Candace (Erin's sister,) Alex (said aforementioned brother,) my mother, and I went to see David Usher at the Living Arts Centre.  GREAT SHOW!  The opening act Chris Koster, (www.chriskoster.ca) he is pretty new as a solo artist and I think has a lot of potential, he is a little nervous which diminished his stage presence, but the one song he did guitar for he just got into and just dominated the room.  So keep it up Chris!  David (with Moist + Electric Violin Girl + Vocal accompaniment Girl) was great, the whole lot of them had a lot of fun with the show and that energy and enthusiasm just filled the room, during his second encore he forgot a whole lot of a song during the acapella part, but three super enthusiastic girls from the audience filled in the blanks, and everyone had a good chuckle as they tried to hit those high notes.  In his embarrassment he didn't finish the song and moved on to St. Lawrence River, I didn't realize a whispered "Fcuk what's that line" was part of the song :)  but what made it great was that he kept going the audience said that's okay we like it anyways, and the show went on.  He did give us a disclaimer at the start that this was the first show in about 4 months, and so they were rusty and that there was nothing like a "spectacular train wreck."  The show was as far from a wreck as could be, and the rusty spots just made it all the more personal.    Great night Great Show nuff said

       So my fiance&eacute; and I, Erin, have purchased a house, actually loyal followers of the beta blog, or anyone who knows me, knows this.  Mainly because I really only have one or two things of interest to talk about, and this one is a pretty big one, and since I don't actually have the house yet, I'm still very much excited about the house.    So we purchased the house from the good people at Mattamy Homes, a very reputable builder with which, Erin's parents, Janet and Bob, or often Mr. Westmen and Mrs. Westmen, or occasionally and awkwardly Hi, ... (indicating a trailing off silence.)  As they are my future inlaws, and I do have a genial relationship with them, you think I could comfortably sink into the names they have offered, Bob and Janet, or as Janet said, His Highness and Janet, anyways I am tangential here and I don't mean too, suffice it to say they have owned to Mattamy's and remain happy with their current one.  So Erin and I felt confident in our purchase, now I have no complaint persay, as I have never purchased a house before but the whole new house scene is scary and lonely.  First you get the Sales Pitch, followed by the Mortgage Sprint, and Lawyer Dash and Dot (all soon to be Olympic sports.)  Currently petitioning for status as an exhibition sport include the Design Centre Dance, and Loan Insurance pillage.  After the first three, you have signed a million papers, handed over a ton of dough, signed over your souls and first born, and then boom its all done, like some cosmic birth, its BANG followed by a few millennia of cooling off.  So in the time between it all has become like some surreal dream, and I am not sure I have bought a house, to reaffirm the impending financial burden, Erin and I discuss it at length, with anyone who will participate, and trust me there are line of people willing to add input on the colour you should pick for the underside of your mailbox (not that I get a mailbox, stupid Canada Post "Superbox" Super pain in the butt is more like it.) I digress once more, so Erin and I are now at this point where we need to know what the whole thing is going to cost after upgrades so we can budget for the house, budget for the wedding, budget for the honeymoon, and budget for groceries other then craft dinner. To calculate all this, we need prices and for prices we need to go to the design centre, and for the design centre we need to be called by Mattamy, and we need time.  Well with Erin now finished her first degree (way to go sweetie!!!) we have said time, and so we decided this weekend that we shall commit this weekend and to go to the design centre on our own time and just get an idea.  When low and behold the first business day after said decision the design centre calls and says "Its time to come in for your appointment."  Hence the irony, but the telephony, OY! getting a hold of some one and then booking an appointment, its telephone tag all over the place.  So we are booked but it only took 800 billion calls.  House here we come!!!!!

       good afternoon, and welcome to my blog, don't know how you got here or if anyone is listening, but who cares, a blog doesn't judge :)  Anyways, today it finally happened, the car died.  It really died friday night, but you know how a terminal patient can linger, so has the car.  This morning the garage called, and gave the diagnosis, its the engine... Its not that it couldn't be replaced, but minimum 600 for the engine and 800 labour + mystery extras + tax is sure to be 2500, and I am not willing to put that in, especially if I can get a new car for a little over 13000, and in any case I really can't affoard either right now.  So ladies and gentlemen, please bow your heads in a moment of morning for the car.

       Should it occur that you find yourself trapped in a dungeon, in a less then ogre form, with your stallion donkey, and your adorably deadly cat, who has a passion for floppy hats and tall boots, whilst only manacles, a cell door, and a castle wall armed with a milk frothier stand between you and your lady love, fear not, because through the improbable powers of magic, everything will work out.  How you ask?  Well I won't spoil it for you, because I think Shrek 2 is a great movie, and worth the sticky floors, and uncomfortable seats, even if you sit on the end of a row, where boneheads with big feat tromp up and down past you stomping your feet each time they pass.  Why on earth would anyone want to endure such a thing, what movie could possibly entice me back to the sinister theater complex to be gouged of my 14 dollars for a ticket, and 10 dollars for my death tub, and sugar barrel (aka large popcorn with "topping" and ten gallon pop?)  Without going into a tirade about topping, and I assure you I have a tirade stored up all about topping and the other fowl lies of the theater industry (from an inside source,) I will tell you.  Shrek 2, lets you forget for a moment all the tripe that has been pumped down the movie pipe line, and enjoy a well animated, well written, well spoken show.  Now it doesn't let you forget for too long about the tripe, because it slips in all sorts of reference to pop culture, in a twisted fun way, so you can't hope to not laugh at some of it.  What it had that so many sequels don't is freshness.  It wasn't the same jokes completely rehashed like Austin Powers 2 and Three, Charles Angels 2, and Beverly Hills Cop 2, 3.  Just to pick on the principle actors a bit, but in this case it was fresh.  Now the moral was the same, Beauty is skin deep, and thats a great moral anyways, especially in this age of EXTREME Makeover, and The Swan.  I mean what person can't help but feel ashamed if you tell them the only way they can be pretty is to go to extremes, or to liken them to the ugly duckling.  Except in the case of the Swan you have fifteen but ugly ducks and one swan.  Can you say early childhood onset eating disorders as popular mainstream behaviour?  So I digress, the point being that Sherk 2, is fresh, funny, pokes fun, (even a little at itself,) is appropriate and amusing for all ages and shows a new level in detailed animation (not life like, but that is intentional.)  So spend you $$$, support the movie industry, (don't buy the popcorn,) and tell me one thing?  Do you know the muffin man?

After that, its a poo poo to all you other ladies as I will be married, actually you pretty much have less then a snowballs chance in hell with me now, becuase I am the happiest guy on earth, engaged to the most wonderful girl in the world.  So its not like there was any chance, but May 21st will pretty much dash those clinging to some shed of hope.  Sorry.  FYI people that is the long weekend up here in Canada, and sort of Erin and I's 6th aniversary, the official date has always been either the 28th, or the 21st, so I think we will take the 21st as official, just for sentimentality of it :)  Woot I'm getting hitched!!!!  peace out!

       Nothing makes my weekend, then sleep, curled up like a cat on the sofa snoozing away a somewhat bleary long weekend.  Okay truth be told I can't curl up like a cat, because Erin's cat Ben (a reincarnation of Ivan the Terrible,) can actually jam his foot up his nose if he wanted too.  Sooo to rephrase, splayed out, in an uncatlike fashion on the Cottage Sofa, with a book forgotten dangling from my limp hand as I sleep away the afternoon.  Add to it a cute girl, Erin, who is similarly entwined in sleep, sharing said sofa, and you have my recipe for relaxation.  I could have used a little more outdoor time, but it was cold and buggy, and we were out there a lot helo-chopptering (the verb describing the act of piloting an out of control remote control helicopter.)   Add some dangerous explosives (aka fireworks in a windstorm) and you have yourself a great weekend, or at least I did!

         I am The Tire around turn I endlessly until popping day    I present this haiku to you, as I begin this discussion of the inner life of car tires.  Sure its not a great life, I'm sure it is in fact largely a nauseating life, turning and turning and turning, just typing it makes me sick.  So between bouts of nausea, I'm sure tires complain endlessly to their neighbor's.  Yet neighbor is all they will ever be, as the cruel task masters who enslave them deny them the close companionship of fellow members of their species.  Only as young children do they cavort together through factories and stores, only to find that adolescence striped from them as they are rotated and balanced into perfect harmony with a car.  There to slavishly carry the car safely over all manner of surfaces, only to end their life shamefully in a mass grave, where they will spend eternity in a purgatory of idleness, or for the unfortunate few, the hellishness of the tire fire.  Some few will be forced into further servitude in some new reincarnate form, which the man tries to tell you is recycling.  So if this is their life, is there any wonder why they might wallow endlessly, only to one day find they can take it no longer.  In that deepest moment of sorrow to open their treads to some road debris like a defeat samurai general pressing his pressing his sword to his breast.  Like many a tire before, and many a tire after, my tire found this moment of despair and choose, the easy way out.  Without ceremony or a sound it was over, and its lifeless shell clung to my car, flapping in the RPM's.  Caught between mourning for my tire, and general loss of vehicle control, I was forced to the shoulder.  There I performed the last rites, as befitting my lost friend.  Also known as the rites of Jack and Tire Iron.  As I raised the car up on the steel, its comrades whipped by in silent salute, each one leave a wake understanding, and as if the car could think, it leaned into spaces left behind, yearning to rejoin with the road and is pack.  When at last the rites were finished, we left that shoulder, by that road, where one poor tire ended its days.  In one final salute to their lost neighbors and long time friend, engine, car, and tires all roared back to the road throwing up dust, tears and a piercing shriek.  And such is the way of tires.

       Phew, sanding and Fraser, seem like opposites, blue collar and high brow, but hey that's me.  I mean I'm a yuppie intellectual computer geek, I just happen to like to get my hands dirty with a little bit of construction.  So tonight I sanded a large portion of "the shelf" do do do, and after moving it out of the basement to improve air flow, I replaced the hand with a electric palm sander to increase sawfust flow, and that flow was still straight into my lungs.  So I will be coughing up hair balls for days  In spite of that, the shelf is coming along smoothly, hopefully I will be able to put the first coat of stain on this weekend, maybe even the second.  So where does Fraser come in, well he is the reason I am not doing more sanding, I wanted to see the finale.  I admit to having drifted away from the show in the later years, but it was a show I always enjoyed, witty, loquacious, quirky, and just real, even when it is at its most eccentric and crazy, there was always a taste of how it was real life.  So tonight I watch and join a loyal following of watchers to bid adieu to Dr. Fraser Crane.

       Organic, Shmorganic Its all a load of bull, modern farming techniques, and I only loosely call them modern have allowed man kind to overcome the theoretical limits on population size, instead of over population, famine and war, we have over population, and war.  Although population is leveling in out in most developed nations, and famine does exist in the third world, but wait it doesn't have to... (I'll get back to this.)  My first point is the we have been GM'ing food for years, breeding livestock for specialization, grafting and fertilizing plant lines to get the best, GM just lets us do it in a few less steps, then along comes a bunch of no nothings and want us to switch back to stone age methods, maybe I should hunter gatherer myself some beef while I'm at it.  Organic food means lower crop yield, lower quality crop and more waste, but what is worse, to make it appear like it is the same quality crop, marginal crops are trashed increasing waste, and making the poor starving people even more starving, fortunately I think the avg. starving person is ignorant of that particular form of food waste. Then you take the starving third world nations, where crops could be modified to thrive in marginal conditions, instead, we stop development on them, as there is a fear that they are dangerous.  Anyways the most recent hit to the GM food industry was here http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3703791.stm where a major GM company stopped/postponed research on GM wheat because of market push back.  I can understand them not wanting to waste money on the project, I just think the market has its head screwed on backwards.  BAH!

       Okay, so now that I am good and blasphemous, JC is Jacqueline Carey.  Her works are wonderful, maybe not for the young, or offendable, but wonderful none the less.  I actually feel her work is better then Tolkien, and that is saying a lot from me.  Anyways here are the three books she has in print   Kushiel's Dart Kushiel's Chosen Kushiel's Avatar  Hey it might just be, yes it is a trilogy.  What is sad, yet refreshing is that she has committed that this set of characters story has ended, which I admire, since I feel too often now days authors start on these unending epics which can never be brought to a satisfying closure for the die hard fans, and tends to weaken early work.  Its not that more couldn't be done, they are great characters, but mercifully she is going to leave them alone.  Yet fear not, because she just announced (more or less recently, I don't check her site daily or even weekly,) a new book.  Yeah!  So below I have copied the synopsis from her site, sounds good to me, I eagerly await it.  I encourage anyone to hit their library or book store and try the first one in the series.  They are big, but they tantalizing your intellect, emotions, imagination, and intimacy.  Geoff Out!   Synopsis from her site:  Banewreaker:  Volume One of the Sundering In the Seventh Age of the Sundered World, the world of Urulat lies uneasy under the shadow of Satoris Banewreaker, whom Men and Ellylon name the Sunderer. Wounded and defeated in the Shapers' War, banished by the Six Shapers who are his kindred, the Sunderer has raised a mighty army of Fjeltroll in his fortress of Darkhaven. At his side are the dreaded Three, his immortal generals. Together with the Sorceress of the East, they have conceived a plot to conquer the sundered world of Urulat and bring all of existence under their dominion  This is their storyÂ and they're going to lose.   For a red star has risen over Urulat, and the time of the Prophecy has come. In the halls of the Rivenlost, the wizard Malthus studies the portents, and in the depths of the desert, a child is born with the mark of destiny emblazoned on his palms, unaware that the fate of the world will rest in his hands. A valiant company of travelers undertakes an impossible quest to retrieve the dagger Godslayer and destroy the Sunderer. As the forces of Darkhaven move to thwart their plans, events unfold to reveal the intricate linkage between triumph and tragedy, between good and evil.  The Sundering asks the question: Which is which?

       I had a chance last weekend to visit my school buddy Rod at his new house, new to him the house is one hundred years old I'm told.  I must say I was surprised, first off his property backs right on to the escarpment in Grimsby Ontario making for a nice backyard.  His neighbour had this cool layered thing going with a sauna or something, and Rod said he and his soon to be Wife will be following suit.  The deck, the outside of the house, and the garage are awesome.  They are mostly new, clean and in great repair.  The inside is well laid out, but needs a lot of work; good thing Rod is a handyman, because his floors are going to take forever.  Ancient painted and repainted hard wood that is rotted in places is going to be quite the challenge, but if all goes well he should have the place in great shape by the wedding, which is in November.  My only negative about the whole trip is that the city planners of Grimsby aught to be taken out back and beaten with a 2x4.  Who puts a billion unmarked turns in Main Street?  Its freaking MAIN STREET people, the MAIN street of the town, the Street which acts as the MAIN source of traffic and reference for your city, and yet you twist it all up and don't tell people what's going on.  I think you have a better chance of finding the end of the rainbow, or at least getting a box of lucky charms before you would find the end of that street.  City planers, what can I say, GET A CLUE? 	 Road induced rage, as opposed to driver induced rage they name is Main Street.

        urlLink      Here is the teaser and the  urlLink link  to a great article in today's  urlLink Toronto Star  about the butter tart, yet another Canadian delicacy.   Patriotic pastry Oh, Canada. You confound us in our search for a unified culinary identity. The regions are so individual and the myriad cultures so diverse, it seems impossible. However, there are a few dishes that are definitely Canadian. And the flakiest, the ooziest and the sweetest of these is the butter tart.

       Mmmmmmmm, 5 day weekend, what to do what to do?  Well I think I will start with a little web slinging action from Sam Rami's Spiderman 2, I wonder if Ivan Rami, and Stan Lee have there requisite cameos?   Then a good nights sleep and its Canada Day!  So I shall celebrate my Canadian pride with some sleeping in, reading, and video games, followed by a 3 hour drive to the cottage.  Sweet sweet cottage, well its been a family dream to own a cottage for years, Erin's (for those who just tuned in Erin is my fiancé) parents own a beautiful cottage on Georgian Bay, just about 20-30 minutes past Perry Sound.  The cottage is a 3 story A-Frame that stands at the mouth of a small bay, at the bottom of a big bay on Georgian bay.  Actually there may or may not be one additional level of bay in between, but the last two bays in the bay hierarchy are Dent Bay and Carling bay (I think.)  All these bays aside, the cottage is nice and high with a beautiful view of the bay(s,) and no neighbours crammed up your nose, there are neighbours, just not too close.  So I will fritter away Friday and Saturday in cottage style, with lots of sleep, great food, swimming sun and a few light chores.  I think I am on task to change the 15 smoke detectors around the place.  Just for good measure I think I will add in some video game playing to my task list, I don't want to miss anything important.  So if you suckers are reading this, then I hope where ever you are connected to the internet is as nice as mine, and that hopefully your weekend is as good as mine.

           Continuing on my sojourn into Canada and Canadian culture I shall examine the beer.  The beer is good, in variety and volume; if libations were a bullion currency then the Canadian standard is gold, or maybe platinum.  Expert beer consumer Chris Ness has this to say, "it's the middle road, its not quite German quality, but it is better then American beer.  You can also get some bad Mexican beer."  Really isn't that what's important, I mean who wants to be as crazy and single minded to the devotion of beer craft as the Germans?  If we were where would me find the time to have such a high nation sex average (time / year) or time to partake of the nectar of the grain?  Yet we do strive for a level of quality far above that of our southern cousins, because they drink shit!  So raise your bottles, cans or kegs in salute this weekend, and drink Canadian Gold.

       	As Canada day is approaching the annual migration of city dweller to weekend dock rat takes place, I thought I might share my feelings on this fair land of ours.  In light of recent elections I have found my Canadian pride and nationalism rekindled, especially by the Bloc Quebecquois.  I wonder if there is anything else so distinctly Canadian is having an official political party devoted towards breaking up the country.  I mean in any other country you would be committing an act of treason, look at Chechnya.  I think in the US as long as you stay on your plot of land, and only come out in the open once in a while to burn a flag, and buy big big big guns you are tolerated, but if you actually started to openly try and divide the country you would probably find yourself in court on treason charges, and my guess is that in some states that carries the death penalty.  In Canada mind you, it is a very different story, so different in fact that 12% of the population can elect 18 % of the federal members of parliament.  In fact if you take into account the eligible voters who aren't worth a damn (see  urlLink Minority Government ) only 7.2% of the population elected the Bloc into 54 ridings.  So here we have this federal party of whiners telling us that Quebec is hard done by and abused by the rest of Canada, and they want Sovereignty.   Now I hope Canadian's will recall that Sovereignty as defined by the last referendum lets them keep their Citizenship, passports, currency, and a bunch of other Canadian niceties, but they get self-government.  Well, I think it's a load of bullocks, and if Citizens don't like Canada they can migrate, but Quebec is a part of Canada, a part of our history and a part of our national character, and without Quebec we wouldn't have Poutine, and then we might as well just be the 51st State.  So fie on you Gilles Duceppe, because I am willing to fight for my right to put cheese curds and gravy on fries! 	 	To say that is the only reason I like Canada is an injustice to Canada and myself, so here are some other things I love about our fair land.  Our national/provincial parks, trails and wildlife preserves, if you haven't noticed, Canada is just teaming with nature.  To start with we are the second largest country in the world, but population wise we are far from it, and with most of us living with one hour of the border, that makes Canada one seriously empty place.  In that emptiness I find beauty that for some has only been shared through the brush strokes of folk like Tom Thompson and the rest of the Group of Seven.  At times Canada is sharp, and rugged, great mountains rise like teeth high into the sky, white topped and beautiful.  Then Canada can go to the opposite with its majestic forests, and waterways like those of Algonquin Park.  I am not a hard-core camper and as such much of Canada isn't open to me, but even when standing at the doors to this great land I am overcome by is wonder.  At times the only way I can express the diversity of Canada's nature is with the songs of the Canadian comedy band the Arrogant Worms.  In such songs like  urlLink Rocks and Trees:  	Cause we've got rocks and trees, and trees and rocks,  	and rocks and trees, and trees and rocks,  	and rocks and trees, and trees and rocks,  	and rocks and trees, and trees and rocks,  	and water. Or  urlLink Canada is Really big:  	our mountains are very pointy, our prairies are not 	the rest is kind of bumpy, but man do we have a lot! 	(we've got a lot of land, we've got a whole lot of land)  	And the list of patriotic comedy ditties just goes on and on and on.  That's another thing about Canada, we can laugh at ourselves and say boy aren't we silly, everyone one has a few jibes, a few laughs and then we move on.  Its not like we need some massive documentary that rips off book titles to get our political views across in a hostile manner.    	Well my train just pulled in, so off to work I go, I hope this makes it clear I think Canada is great, but if not I have all Canada to drink Canadian beer, sit on a dock in majestic lake country ponder and blog about it.  My name is Geoff, and I have a Canadian problem "Hi Geoff"

       I would just like to say that Microsoft Word is not blog friendly.  In fact while preparing my blog entries from within word I find myself at the mercy of the auto correct feature.  Part of it is words tendency to replace apostrophes and quotation marks with stylized equivalent.  I suppose that in a word document it is kind of nice to have your 66 99 and 6 9 style punctuation.  The problem I have is when they are copied into a pure text editor they are properly displayed, but when they are submitted in the blogger.com's web form, they become horribly mutated and discombobulated entities.  Like so "" = “” and '' = ‘’.  Don’t get me wrong, I like word, this is just a pet peeve of mine.    It just means that my entries require  reformatting before posting.

       Well P.M. is still the PM, but other then that everything else has changed.  No longer will the Liberals control the house, instead they will have to fight for every inch, and compromise with the other factions.  Honestly, I think this is great!  I know I have said that I stand behind Paul, that statement is true, but I think in this case, that with the Liberals having a clear minority, it allows them to lead a mandate down the middle of socialist, ecenomic and ecological change.  With the checks and balances added by the other stake holders Mr. Martin will have his hands full, and maybe the government will collapse in 12-24 months, but the exciting chance for change in that time can't be ignored.  Money for defense, cuts to bloated federal departments, health care, and maybe some excitement in the land of civil liberties, who knows, anything and everything might happen.  So common kiddies hold on your seats (for those incumbents who were lucky enough,) and lets see where this country is going.    As an aside, for you worthless shits who didn't vote, yeah you know who you are you 40%, if I catch you bitching about anything that happens between now and your next opportunity to vote, I am going to tell you to stuff it.  You had your chance to vote, and only that vote give you the right to my attention.  You could have spoiled your ballot, or did a protest vote, or officially abstained, but doing nothing was not an option.  You should have gone down to your polling station and made your mark where ever that may be, but for not doing that, you have dropped to the lowest level of my regard, I value the opinion of a Marxist over you, because at least he had the courage to voice his opinion.  So between now and then even if the they pass a law to double taxes to all the people who didn't vote I don't want to hear a word out of you, because you don't have a say, you forfeited that privilege!

        urlLink    These are my new running shoes, and some socks to go with them.  Thanks to my friend Kevin, and my scary doctor I started running a few weeks back.  It whips the living shit out of me, but I feel energized when I'm done.  So after a few weeks in my feet started to hurt.  From the get go Kevin kept disrespecting my old shoes.  He told me I needed to get proper shoes designed for running, and to my style of running.  So after enough pain I did.  Boy did it help!  Tonight I easily ran most of my route, by at least a full 1/3 more then usual, and when I was not running it wasn't because of pain in my legs, it was because my heart/lungs were pushed to the max and I needed a breather.  So thanks Kevin, I'm glad I listened, these shoes ROCK!  Also congratdulations to Kevin on completing his triathalon two weeks back.

       !!!!!Warning the following is a highly biased rant, and I don't care!!!!!  	When I was but a wee lad of nary a few more winters then seventeen, I worked for a media mega complex of the devil.  Not satisfied with an abusive summer job of regular portion evil, I had to super size, so I threw in my lot with Viacom, one of North America's largest forces for the perpetuation of evil.  In my part as lowly drudge, I slaved for one particularly sinister subdivision of Viacom, specifically Famous Players.  I worked for the dark lord's omni-mega-ultra-demon-plex also known as the Coliseum Mississauga.  Now, I would like to clear up any misconception that I might be unbiased in my opinions of this place, but let me state up front 1.  I was fired, and 2. I hated them before I got fired, getting fired just helped me hate them more.  So let me delve into the evil that is done by this business in a more organized fashion, because if the preceding style is allowed to fall any further below its level of comprehendability, its going to start looking like some crazy guy with a pair of scissors and a news papers cut and pasted it together.  	  How I knew that the Coliseum was affiliate with the dark lord.  1.	Dark Symbols:  Specifically the organization and construction of the building placed key components of the building (Box office, managers office, concession, ticket line up, and the washrooms,) at perfect mathematical position to form a pentacle (a known symbol of evil if TV has taught me anything) around the main concession stand.  2.	Cacophony of evil praises:  At the centre of the theatre stood a gigantic alter to evil, which sprayed forth kernel's, nearly constantly, of evil high into the sky on a regular basis, with each kernel was released and ear splitting cry in praise of dark practices performed in the building.    3.	Murder most fowl: Well not murder per say but definitely assisted suicide, under the false pretence of health.  To start with MOVIE POPCORN IS BAD FOR YOU!  Didn't know that, want to sue them?  What are you an ignorant shit, or someone out for cash?  Fast food is bad for you, hot coffee burns, if you break into my house and fall down my stairs, tough shit, you're a moron, and Darwin would be proud you are out of the gene pool.  That sub-rant aside, would you like topping with that? Or should I say would you like a heart attack with that?  Movie popcorn topping hides its true evil under the guise of its associate brand name, Becel.  Becel happens to make a particularly health conscious margarine.  That is not what they put on your popcorn, what goes on your popcorn is 100% hydrogenated vegetable oil, also known as heart attack in a squirt.  You might as well get the butter; it tastes better and probably is better for you (I don't have the science behind that, but I do know that they are both bad for you, who can say what's worse.)  So what you say?  Well they take your knowledge that Becel makes a good margarine to get you to put topping on your popcorn, to get you to like it more, to get you to buy more, to help you kill yourself!!!! MURDER I say MURDER!  4.	Dark Practices:  The economics of the movie theatre is pure genius, and evil all at once.  First off ticket prices, 13.50 – 14.50 on a Friday night, that's awful, and in spite of popular belief that those go straight to the distributor, that is a load of bull crap, a lot of it does, but a nice hefty margin was tacked on at the beginning of the megaplex era for the theatres to take home, which more then covers the cost of theatre operation and employees.  That leaves money from the concession sales to go straight into their pockets, and boy does it ever.  50 lb bag of popcorn = 10$  It makes probably 200 –300 large bags of popcorn for customers, add on a .05 cent per bag price, and maybe .03 worth of the aforementioned murder sauce.  You get a per  bag cost of about 13 cents.  Pay some moron minimum wage to sell it for 4.50 a bag and remember on a Friday night you sell that many bags in less then an hour, and you are making about 4.33 a bag.  You get about 30 hours of solid sale in a weekend, your making 26000 in popcorn money alone, and I promise you all those numbers are far below actual numbers, as I know for a fact on an average weekend the theatre would make ¼ to ½ a million, and over a million on blockbuster summer long weekends.  That kind of extortion is absurdly evil, what's even worse is that people are willing to kill themselves for that price.  You know they (they being the news paper or web site I am likely misquoting) are estimating that by 2020 a night out (dinner and a movie for two) will exceed $200  go go gadget inflation!  5.	They fired me, me, darling me, who would want to fire me.  Actually this is embarrassing and in fairness I will share.  The day I got fired I was working a special shift, you see the fry guys (the guys who worked in the new your fry stand) were lazy lazy lazy people.  At the end of the day, they were supposed to take all the left over French fries and uncooked (but cut) potato's out to the trash compactor.  Instead they would bag'm and drag'm the minimum distance they could and leave them just outside the door on the way to the compactor.  This process created a problem as now all the bags were slightly damaged by the drag.  Some times they would life these damage bags into the trash trolleys used to collect garbage around the theatre.  In this one exertion of bag liftage, about half the time those bags would break spilling their contents all over the trash trolleys.  The guys on garbage duty would never empty the loose potato's into the compactor, so these would build up and rot.  On this particular day I was tasked, with two others, to empty the four trolleys that were full, because this had been going on for weeks, and now all the trolleys were unusable.  Now you have to understand, I can't stand mold, makes me hurl, so here I am with too co-drudges shovelling rotting potato in the burning sun and then bleaching them out, for like 4-6 hours.  When it was all said and done, they gave us a pat on the back, said "you stink go home," and sent us home for the day without paying us for the rest of the shift.  Now maybe it was my encouraged ego from the slight complement, maybe it was me trying to show off to friends, maybe it was mold fumes getting to me, or maybe it was because EVERYONE INCLUDING THE MANAGERS DO IT!  What ever made me do it, who can tell for sure, I decided that night to go to a movie with my friends and not pays (GASP) so we walked up to the place they rip your tickets, said "hey were sneaking in," there person was like "sure."  So we walked into the theatre.  Sadly, I got caught in the theatre, and decided to be honest instead of lie and say I lost my ticket.  So the sacked me, and the girl who let me sneak in.  What really made it worse was that it was 'Night of the Roxbury', I mean really fire me for sneaking into something good, laugh at me for sneaking into something CRAP!  What really chaffed my ass was that the girl was rehired for crying and she was so useless that she made useless tits contenders for MVPs on NHL teams even though they don't know how to skate… AND Breath, 2, 4, 5.  So, I really didn't do anything that wrong, they just nailed me up as an example.  I mean I was guilty, but so were all the other employees and managers, I mean the managers used to pick up girls by giving them free passes with their home numbers on the back Alright I am going to call a stop to this tirade, it has gone out of control, and I don't want to proof read it.  Suffice it to say I don't like famous players, nor do I like movie popcorn, yet I like a good little automaton will continue to go to movies and buy popcorn.  Like tomorrow night I am going to see Spider Man 2.  So there me!  The Bitter Bitch

       	So I've been a little remiss in my blogging, and my readership of one has take offence that he has been forced to stare too long at images of my boo boo's.  So, I will try and catch up with my life today, as uninspiring as parts of it has been.  First off, I'm excited that I now have a reader, other then my mother, no offence to my mother but she has to like what I write, my non-related readers don't (have to, nor do they, but they are reading it any ways.  In part it is that readers fault that I am blogging right now, as he complained that I have a duty to my readers as an unspoken pack to keep this blog up-to-date.  Dammit he might be right, except I explicitly said early in this endeavour that if everything goes to hell and I don't blog for a couple weeks/months/years then meh!  Don't get me wrong, I like blogging, I get to be expressive and play with English, but I am not going to let it rule my life.  At the moment though, I find myself in possession of about an hour to blab, so blab I shall.

       	Have you ever noticed, 1.  I have been writing a lot more recently?  2. Blog is not in the Blogger.com's dictionary?  Well its not, actually a lot of words are not, it's a funny dictionary, and the 'learn' button does nothing.  If I were blogger.com, I would call up my coworkers at gmail.com (since I am pretty sure they are all one and the same,) and I would share the technology for gmail's spell checker, by far an easier tool to use!  While I was at it, I would also see if I could steal the 'label' concept and implement it into blogger, imagine all your posts labelled to what categories they fell into, that way you could have pages set up to archive by label, and pages to archive by date.  I think that would be boss!  I wonder if they are open to feedback, because I think I am going to recommend this very thing.  Oh and as for the prolific, mediocre, writing, I have started  doing it  on the train, so I have 1.5 hours a day dedicated to plumbing the depths of my mind.  Bloggity Blog has left the building!

       	I just want to thank my Dungeon and Dragon's Group of yore, as in trying to find a seed of an idea on which to write, I have naturally drifted back to my creative high school years.  Now I will admit here and now that I was a massive nerd in high school, D&D, AV Club, Drama club, heck I'm marrying the head prefect for that matter, but you know what, I'm proud of those days, I had a lot of fun, and don't regret a moment of it, especially note the head prefect, I particularly like her!  So digging back to those days I find that some of the stuff my D&D group made up in the dank basement is just damn funny, and in some cases epic.  So if any of you guys out there read these stories and remember, yes I am stealing those nights and bottling them up for the net.  So, to Trevor, Mark, Ken, and Chris (who is also my webmaster,) thanks, and to the rest of the crowed of occasional wanders who joined in and departed our rag tag cadre thanks to you as well.  Also Steve, Bob, Dave and that Guy who moved to France,  my university crew, I might steal some of that as well!   Cheers.

       	On many a night hence, I have return to the Dirty Elf to reveal in the stories of my new friends, the pungent 'eroes Scobar and Mombo.  Tonight I was privy to a new form of entertainment that these two dwarf gentiles introduced to me.  The game, if such an activity could be called a game, is known to the boys as Mugs.  Mugs doesn't it, in my mind at least, have a clear victor, nor are all the participants voluntary.  The game progresses like so:  First player orders, and chugs a tankard, second player selects a patron at the bar, first player then whips his empty tankard at the head of the patron, then its second players turn to drink and throw.  The game proceeds until the players are too drunk to throw, or the patrons are all unconscious, or a fight breaks out.  With their dwarven constitution, I don't think Scobar and Mombo even understand the concept of "too drunk".  As for the patrons being unconscious, possible I suppose, but I have never seen it happen.  Now, as for a fight breaking out, that is pretty much the expected norm I suspect.  I think the whole game is pretence for a good honest brawl, and given the crowd at the Dirty Elf, I'm not all together surprised they oblige the dwarf's their game.  As I have mentioned, the Dirty Elf is a squalid whole in Waterdeep's Adventure quarter, with the seediest bunch up in comers and the most retched bunch waiting to receive their comeuppance.  There isn't a green warrior in the bunch, or at least not by the end of the night.  So my readers, that is the game of mugs, and now I must lay myself back down, as I have a terrible bruise on the back of my head, alas me thinks some one mighten have thrown a mug there!

       Wow, I'm watching the Canadian Leadership Debate, and now I know why the liberal colour is red, because they are bleeding out there.  I suppose it is tradition that a seated party should draw the most targets as their opposition tries to unseat them.  I'm in agreement with my parents on this one, and that is, I feel Paul Martin has a passion, and a vision, and can make a difference, but he has to untangle himself from the scandals of the past and push forward.  I'm afraid his attack campaign has worked against him, and with 11 years of liberal government behind us, just sheer will for a change might be enough to boot the Liberals, and I think its a real shame.  Layton (beside from looking weird...) is just unrealistic, and while I sometimes find myself on side with the NDP, I turn around and watch unions destroying industry.  Remember people a union should never have the right to penalize you for working harder, or protect you for being a lazy waste of air.  I still feel union's have a place in this world, but working and legal conditions have changed, and union's haven't, its time to grow up!  Harper, well, I'm not sure he is that scary, but I think the extreme right of his party is going to make us Mini-America and bleed our individuality dry in the process.  Duceppe, I just can't be pro-separatist, although he seems to have a fairly good left of centre policy, ironically he makes a pretty good opposing when he is not trying to divide the country.  I think most telling in this election is the undercurrent of conservative defection, these are hard-line traditional PC candidates jumping ship to the Liberals?    Gah, this is just unnerving and after watching the debate I'm just all the more disgusted at the childishness of the other leaders.  So who am I going to vote for?  Well I think you would guess Liberal, and at any other time in my life I would agree, but right now, I think I will vote for Carb Option's party, because they at least are promising a tastier Canada.

       Stupid batteries, my gameboy has been providing a new source of entertainment with Sword of Mana,  Sword of Mana is in itself pretty good, but not the topic of this rant, the rant is about battery life, sleep mode and stupidity.     First off battery life, the life on the gameboy's lithium ion battery is pretty solid, about ten hours of game time when the back light is on. I hesitate to even try and speculate the life without the backlight, but I would assume it is substantially more.  Now I think my battery is showing a little bit of age and I think I only get like six to eight hours these days, but I'll manage somehow.  My problem is the battery light, with its evil red glow telling you, "times up" but the truth is, "times up" is more like, "please save soon, your battery is dying and could go anytime now sir."  I have noticed that from the time the light goes on to the time the screen winks out can be anywhere from ten to thirty minutes.  That's a lot of time to save.  Yet it still triggers that battery death reaction where you panicked search about for a save spot.  That panicked look becomes a reckless search, and recklessness leads to death, and death means no saving, so its a vicious circle, one that doesn't need to happen in light of 30 minutes of battery remaining.    That brings me to the sleep function, what a great bloody function, battery running low, that's okay, put the gameboy to sleep, and then you can wake it back up when you are plugged back in, so my question is, with this awesome function, why don't more games use it!

       	As you saunter though the   of the Dirty Elf Tavern, in the bowels of Waterdeep's Adventure Quarter, you are greeted by a strange weathered note pegged to the door frame by what looks like a large animal fang.  In nearly illegible common is scrawled the words, "'ero's Wanted?  Come in bar! Cee Spiky Dwarfs!"  At first glance one must wonder if this is the note has been written by a four year old, and proudly pegged up by his father, (the barkeep?) for all to see.  On second glance your realize no self respecting four year old would right so messy.  Filled with a bizarre curiosity you, as I was, you might wander in to the Dirty Elf to have a gander at what this sign might mean.  Now if it should happen that the last fool to stand where you did followed up on this sign right and proper you might not be greeted by anything but a dusty old tavern filled with adventures and has-beens sucking back a few pints and glorifying the time the beat up the Orc Widow.  On the other hand you might see what I saw on that fateful day on the Sword Coast.  Before I illuminate what I saw, I want to talk to you about some math, now I hear this form of math is all the rage in Candlekeep, as snooty old sages discuss at length how best to get from point A to point C with as little fights at point B along the route, the call it Optimizacracy, a special subset of Divination I am told.  What this fancy number magic might tell you is that if one were standing at the door and were to find the perfect seat at the bar that's the optimal distance from the bar, the outhouse, and the nearest fight, then the two men I met were at that spot, and if you nothing about those men you would say they were powerful sorcerers, but in fact they don't have half a brain between them to make one eighth of a brain for magic.  If we can see our way clear past the math of it, you will find standing that this probabilistically perfect spot two men, and I say men in the loosest of terms, because what I saw where two four foot tall creatures, armour from top to bottom in the a mishmash of tattered hardened leather scraps riveted together, but looking as if they are mostly held together by old grog stains. Mixed into that mangled mess of so-called armour are spikes, and by spikes I mean jutting sharpened steaks of partially rusted iron.  Topping these stout figures is a pair of beards that could rival the main of any savannah lion.  To the left the red headed one with a full head of hair and beard that don't differentiate on where one starts and where ones ends, and generally spread outward until it his a fuzzy region of tangled food remains and crusted grog.  To the right is bald on top but braids all the way down, and dyed green, or perhaps moulded, I pray not check to deep, as neither one has a temperament or a smell that tolerates investigation.  Who are these dwarves, they are the "ero's" Mombo and Scobar, Heroes, Warriors, Drunkards, Battleragers.  Should it happen that you have cattle to save from ravaging Orc's these are not the heroes to call.  If it were the case that Troll's ran off with your daughter these are not the heroes to call, but if hundreds of dragons were swarming an orphanage of help less children and maidens, then call Scobar and Mombo.  For in the thick of battle and destruction, when the odds are insurmountable, and survivability drops to nil, that is where these two will put an ale in one hand axe in the other, and screaming at the top of their lungs charge headlong into battle, and win.  To the dragons who here this tale I warn you one thing, if you dare to spill that ale, then no longer will your death be swift and gentle, but like the winds of Hades burn you until your flesh melts away into dust and death.

           I do realize that what I say here to a sometimes-vacant audience could be perceived to be me stroking my own ego, but really it is an exercise in my literary skills, and an attempt to add humour and satire to my life, and the world.  Perhaps, blogging is also a chance for me to hone my skills and produce something of interest and quality.  What I do take offence at is Illiad’s jokes about blogging in his comic  urlLink User Friendly .  Most recently,  urlLink here ,  urlLink Here> , and  urlLink here  Illiad has made reference that blogging is no more then an author jerking off in the mirror as opposed to some run of the mills smut.  I suppose as a doyen of technical humour it is both his job and his place to express his opinion through the media of his choice, which just happens to be comics on the web, wait a second there, so if I can draw, it legitimizes and social commentary I might make, or  urlLink perhaps personal anecdote of my life I want to share  (no offence to Scott Kurtz on this one, just this  urlLink PVP  is illustrative of that last point.)  Now here is the trick, Illiad, you are entitled to your opinion, and can express it how you choose, the upside to blogging is I CAN DISAGREE, so I do disagree, I think there are plenty of legitimate reasons to blog, are not memoirs just dead tree blogs?  So you blog your way, I blog mine, and if we both keep it up, and millions more join us, one day the web might represent more then a gigantic porn hole (no pun intended.)  Instead it will be a land of people talking, and people listening, and maybe in that space we can bridge our differences and become a global community, hey, it’s got to start somewhere.

           The Raiders came out swinging in the first but were met with staunch resistance, nearly scoring a run but getting forced out at first.  As the Raiders took the field things started out a little loose, and Royal Pain capitalized on that with some stellar surprise hitters, remember, just because a girl is at bat, doesn’t always mean the can’t hit.  The third inning was a catastrophe for the Raider’s as a bad call at home left the team demoralized for the remainder of the inning.  In the last few innings the Raiders picked it back up to keep the scoring in check, but in spite of some power hitting innings were unable to battle back.  Left rover, yours truly, made some good plays early on, but was hindered by a pulled quadriceps.  Star second baser Jane made a good play for a rocket from the outfield, but it bounced funny and took her in the face.  All in all a great effort, and some solid playing, obvious room for improvement, but the potential is there, and most of all it was fun.  Final score was 7 to 19!

       Hi people, I would just like to take this opportunity to gush about my sweet heart, while she knows I feel this way, sometimes I just am so happy I have to share.  Now I don't think she actually reads this, so I can't embarrass myself too much.  So here goes, my love, Erin, is the smartest person in the world, okay so smartest person in the world may be going a tiny bit to far, but she is damn smart!  This week, Thursday, to be exact, she is graduating from the University of Guelph with a Honours batchalor of Science in Microbiology and Genetics, with a minor in Philosophy.  That's a lot to say, but man did she work hard for it.  Now here comes the horn tooting, not only did she graduate from that really really hard sounding faculty, she is proceeding to do her Master's in the generally the same area (my fingers were sore of typing it all out. :)  Add to that Master's (and maybe a PHD,) she is being super funded by NSERC (for non-Canadians that's a HUGE deal.)  Also she is receiving additional funding from the University of Guelph since she is such a smarty pants.  Finally the fill feather in her hat, is that she is receiving an Award for the Highest cumulative Average of a graduating student in MBG.  SO there you go, my sweat heart is a super-genius.  I'm just soooo proud of her, she has worked really hard to earn that, and definitely deserved it!    So to my Erin, congratulations! You did it baby, now just a few more degrees :)

       One of the individuals whom I work with came up with a great quote, we were talking about software bugs, and I said to it him "dammit Sean, your and your pessimistic law, I am expecting things to go wrong and they are going right. (thinks you need to know here is I was referring to Murphy's Law, while not strictly his, his name is Sean Murphy and hence we always joke its his law, and in this case I figured things I want to go wrong going right in this case fell under the category of 'anything that can go wrong will.'  Also Sean asked to be given the reference for the following quotation, hence why his name is being mentioned otherwise I wouldn't name anyone from work.)"  His response was "That's not an application of Murphy's Law, that Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, An watched error condition never expresses itself." Sadly that is not a direct word-for-word quotation, it in fact sounded much better at the time, but since, as Sean says, there is no room in the budget for him to have a personal scribe follow him around all day, such exact witticisms are lost.    So I guess we can say that this is some how adapted from the following paraphrased statement about uncertainty, "One can know the exact position of an electrons, and not its velocity or vice versa"  The more precisely the position is determined, the less precisely the momentum is known in this instant, and vice versa.  --Heisenberg, uncertainty paper, 1927   So we shall now adopt the Murphy-Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle  The more precisely the position of an error condition is determined, the less precisely the error conditions will be expressed in this instant, and vise versa." -- Sean Murphy, random cubicle retorts, 2004.

       Apparently, if a candidate was running in my ridding I should be voting for the Bloc Quebecois.  Go figure, I have always been a pretty rowdy pro Canada kind of person, and her I am waving the separation flag.  Or at least according to this  urlLink quiz.      So who knows, I know who I am voting for, and only because I stand behind the convictions and potential of the leader, not the foolishness of his predecessor, and his cronies.

           She lay alone in her bed, alone in her heart.  The soft patter of rain on the matted straw, tormented her restless ears.  Lightening flashed in the distance, sending beams of white light casting though the shutters, each flicker brought to life the shadow monsters.  Those beast who haunt cluttered rooms at night, terrible beast of fang and tooth, who evaporate by light of day, leaving just clothes, and lamps, and misplaced things.  With a guttural roar the beast shook the room, the shutters shivering in their frames as the lightning's boom reached for her.  In fear she clutched the blankets close to her bosom, trying to gain some measure of comfort from them.  No such peace could be found, for on the heels of one bolt, came the next, each one tearing the night with their discordant energy.  Far off in the distance, lightening touches the top of a tree, like some divine figure smiting one who stood to proud and tall against his might.  Instantly, the tree genuflect to its maker, bursting into a thousand repentant shards.  Glowing, they fall to forest floor only to have their last ounce of life doused by the moist, moldering remains of last autumn's dross.  The storm raged on, her mind raged for that she was without.  The winds wailed through the rafters, crying out for her grief.  She slept not, nor did the storm.   How much?  she thought must one bare. "HOW MUCH?" she queried to the empty night.  In answer the storm split asunder another tree, as if to say, "all that has been taken from you, and more, it is all yours to bare."  She wept, and the storm rained harder, she wailed, the winds blew harder, she raged against the failure of her life, and lightening begot her fury upon the world.    got stuck here, I know where I want to go, but can't get there, just not sure how much, or how little I want to say... well we shall see next time.

       Well, I have at least one reader, and that's my mom, and she likes what I write, and since I know she is going to read this too, that's okay.  It just reminded me of some movie, or maybe it was a Simpson's episode, where some character said "My Mom says I'm cool!"  Which is almost, for a kid, making the exact opposite statement.  I think, for other less subjective^2 things that a mother is a perfectly acceptable provider of critic, even if slightly biased, but I will take what I can get until this place picks up a little.  For a quick side note subjective^2, ^2 indicating squared, or power of 2 for non math/computer notation geeks, means, at least in my make believe land, quality or value of a subjective nature, that is subjectively applied.  Like coolness, it means different things to different people, is valued differently by different people, and is definitely doled out at what might appear to an outside observer in a completely random way.  What might be cool one day is anti-cool the next, unless you are of some level of coolness, and then your are retro cool, what the bear!  Anyways, in light of my recent praise, I believe I am going to try something, something I actually recommended to someone else.  I am going to write a story.  Sort of, one post at a time I am going to look into the lives of some characters, at first it is going to be really really bad, and then we will see what emerges from the my literary primordial soup and transforms into something real.  I will try and keep things some what in order, as order appears probably by prefixing the post title with some sort of grouping name like "Fantasy:" or "Bob's Life:" or whatever else I want to call that thread.  So join me on this ride, and lets see what happens.  By the way, this idea came after I had a fight with my younger brother Alex.  The same Alex I posted about earlier.  I had a disagreement with him about the way we both perceive how one should act in regards to the requests made upon them.  Suffice it to say, I think he is lazy, and he thinks I am a tyrant, and while I would like to be a 'cool' brother, I end up just being a jerk a lot because I hate living in his filth, and in any case we really don't communicate very well.  So in a subversive way of making nice and getting him to communicate better, I set up him the blog  urlLink (someone set up us the bomb get it? get it?) , and encouraged him to develop is writing, because he really can write.  I think I said all that before, so I'm off for tonight, and tomorrow I shall try and make my first story post.  Till then, avast ye scurvy scallywags!

       Well I tried to have a good rant about the election, but my computers hard drive died.  So much for those IBM commercials about the new t-40's "bracing for impact."  Or the magic blue button, to make it all good.  Oh well, so I lost that rant, I don't think it had a moral, other then vote.  I said something about civic duty, and your responsibility to vote.  Yeah that's about it.  Also I set my brother up to start blogging.   urlLink http://gcpeart.evermeet.org/shadowfire/   They say he writes well, I haven't really seen a lot of it so I can't say one way or the other, but I have encouraged him to write, and let himself be heard.  In any case he now had the ability to do so, so lets hope he does.  geoff out

       Well I have sold out to the man, am I ashamed, not really.  Okay so google provides my mail, and google provides the tools I use to build my blog, and google provides me with daily news, and all my searching.  So if google does all this for me, for free, and I don't click on their ads to often, then I am just a jerkish sponge.  So here is the deal, I put google ads on my website to assuage my guilt, so that anyone coming here can help pay google for all their great stuff.  If I make a little on the side, I am sure it is peanuts compared to what google makes, and everyone is happy.  Google because they make money and stay in business, me because I get to use all of Google's stuff because they  make money and stay in business, you because you get to come to my site and click on all these topically related links.  Isn't it great :)  Purple tree monkey out!

I picked up a different default template, and have begun work to totally revamp it, but until that work is done, I'm not going to post the changes, I prefer big bang of new stuffs to show up, instead of incremental stuff.

       Okay here is the equation:  Cold Room + Late Night + discussion of persistence mechanisms = SLEEEEEEEEEEEEP  Okay and the guy was pretty dry.   Now I am in a session on pervasive computing, its a lot more interesting.  Imagine calling a computer airline booking service from your advance phone, asking with voice for "Flights from Toronto to New York" and then having the computer understand you speech and display on your screen all the flights instead of r e a d i n g   t h e m   t o   y o u   v e r y   v e r y   s l o w l y.  Then you read through the list and say "I'd like to book the third one."  Again with out blinking, not that computers blink often, the system understands, and begins to book based upon the information your have stored in your phone, it asks you to confirm.  So you check the display, and oh wait that's your old address.  Make a few quick changes, and then tell the system "Okay its good now."  The computer then asks you for your choice of credit cards.  Your phone beats you to it and offers up your default credit card, which you then key in your password for.  The system thanks you,  you hang up, and then a text message with your confirmation number and eticket number shows up on your display and gets stored into you on phone agenda with flight times.  Now that is what I call a cool idea.  Now lets just see someone do it, now that the tools allow it.  Please, Please do not let this technology empower the asking of "Do you want fries with that?"  On the topic of fries, there is a fast food franchise in the States called Jack in the Box, which is advertising a new type of fry they call "Natural Fries" or something like that because they are fresh cut from real potatoes so as to keep there  skins.  The ad for these new fries has Jack, the mascot, in a news conference with a reporter from France, and the reporter is harassing him in a stereotypical way about not calling them French fries, and does he hate the French, and jack is like "yeah sort of."  The new age of tolerance we live in! BAH!

       Well with a title like that I really don't have much to add.  I spent the night with a bunch of Canadian's from Toronto who all worked for one of the other major FI.  Look out Abe, now I have contacts :)   The food was great, the beer cold, and I got to ride a mechanical bull twice, sadly my best time was about 14 seconds, and thats only because my iron ring got caught in the rope and nearly ripped my finger off keeping me on.  The group of us also played some black jack, and armadillo racing.  To those canuk's like me, armadillo racing is exactly what you think it, take a couple of armadillo's put them in the hands of some crazy tourists, and then when the start gun goes, you drop your squirming armadillo into its track and they run to the end.  There were also trail rides, but by the time I got there, they were already all full up for the night, and you could get your photo taken on a texas long horn (aka a big ass bull!)  Gun fights pervaded the streets, but I think the guns had blanks, because there were not nearly enough bodies to match gun shots.  So it was a good time, these IBM boys know how to throw a good time!

       I thought I could make it the whole week without sleeping through a session.  I failed.  It was a session on webservices security, and it was being presented quite well, but the pasta from lunch and general mental fatigue caught up to me.  Oh well, c'est la vie, I have the slides and they are sending me a cd of the presentation, so I will review it when I get home. I think I have put on a lot of weight here, there is just too much coffee, and snacks and good food, I'm trying to cut back today, but I figure it will take a few weeks after I get home to get back on track with exercise.

       I was taking a break between sessions, and I decided to add some commonly used links to my nav. The inspiration for adding the links was a new  urlLink Strong Bad Email  which I thought was particularly funny.  Anyone who has ever been to  urlLink Homestar Runner  is probably familiar with  urlLink Strong Bad  but I wanted to share, and make it easier for me to navigate there, so I don't get an  urlLink error page  not that I mind, the error always makes me laugh.  Another great part of the site is  urlLink Teen Girl Squad , if you have ever seen one, then you know what I mean when I say they are "Soooooo Gooood!"  Also, I figured while I was updating, I would add my American news source  urlLink CNN  which I don't really endorse or object to, its just convenient.    Finally, I added a link to  urlLink Ill Will Press  which is a site filled with flash animated cynical squirrel rants.  I might move the Homestar and squirrel links down to the comics section, haven't decided yet.  In any case enjoy!

       Stupid Sharon, telling French Jews to give up and move to Israel is like telling the anti-Semitics and the terrorist to "keep it up, your winning."&nbsp; Dammit man wrong way to go on that one, but of course he has gone the wrong way on a lot of things, like the Berlin wall, oh wait that's no what it is called, its the Israel Security barrier, like I'm sure that's going to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I can say is where are you taking me and where did you find a hand basket so large as to carry me?

       Okay so the title is shocking and inaccurate, this article is about director of X-Man and X2 directing a new installment to the Superman franchise.&nbsp; The title is about an installment which failed in preproduction that would have cast Nick Cage as Superman, that just doesn't seem like the right roll, Nick does that up tight guy, and Clark Kent was more home town nervous, I like Nick's work, but I think that would have been a terrible match.

       Grady Booch is an interesting guy, sort of looks like Sean Connery from The Rock, but before the hair cut.&nbsp; His topic was about what was and what will be in software, and he agrees with Chris Ness (a guy I went to school with,) that software is going embedded, and that the death of Moore's law is the answer, but he also agreed with me that OO is here to stay, just OO is going to go to the embedded platform, so Chris, if Grady is right were both right.&nbsp; He did promise a continuance in the current style of display upgrades will continue for years to come, with more BIGGER monitors *grunt grunt grunt*.

       Well we are entering into the end of the day here, Its actually about 4 pm Dallas Time, and we have been going since about 8 am.  There are actually presentations and the such all the way until 8 pm, so I really haven't even entered the "home stretch." In spite of that, my brain still hurts.  I will probably go to sleep right away, if I am smart I will go for a run, a swim and then sleep, we will see if I am smart.  It isn't the good ones that are killing me, it was the last session which was painfully slow, and what is worse is it was painfully slow over content I already know, which just extended the length of a second towards infinite.  I mean I may have been able to speculate the content from the synopsis, but I thought it was going to have a little more flash and dazzel, instead it was the most basic form of the work I have been doing for the last 8 months, so it couldn't help but be boring.  I suppose to a person who has never done that stuff it was very interesting.  I'm just a person who has done that stuff, so it was killer.  I'm in a black diamond presentation now, that will start in a few minutes, so hopefully this is killer interesting, or at least over my head.  I always learn best when someone throws me in the deepend and says swim or die.  As opposed to the shallow end and telling me this is how you kick.  We will see :)

       That explains all the funky lights, video and sound, are opening act for this conference was Cirque Du Soleil, and man are they good.&nbsp; There were lots of misc performers, but at the core of the act we had one of those girls who does all sorts of acrobatics on a rope high above the stage, and this guy with a big metal wire frame cube that he twirled about, it was very neat!&nbsp; He made baton twirlers look like childish.&nbsp; Anyway it was&nbsp;a great show, the speakers were pretty good too, they demoed the new rational tool, it was impressive to say the least, but I actually have seen it before, at a private demo.&nbsp; I just wasn't allowed to talk about it, but I guess since they are show casing it here, let me just say, the eclipse platform is the ultimate integration layer!&nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyways its time for my first regular session, as yesterday was just the jump starts, I must say before I depart that wireless is great! &nbsp; g out

       I feel like I'm at a rock concert here, I am sitting in the third row, the music is pumping the lights are flying everywhere, and there are too giant video monitors playing abstract video. Actually my first impression when I came in, is that this was the room back in late 70's that the girl with the hammer came from, to go smash the screen in the room full of grey people. This is definitely a cultural 180 for the company, but obviously that has been happening for years. What is really great is that the video displays that have crazy stuff on them are in fact largely made up of clips from the open sequence to the movie Contact. Oh lights are dimming, its time for the main show, I wonder what instrument the key note plays?

       Ah the joys of coffee, and software development in java.&nbsp; Its all so good!&nbsp; Today has been pretty good, better then I anticipated in fact.&nbsp; Most of the presenters (sorry guys not all) are very proficient at speaking.&nbsp; So it has been really good, the topics interesting warmups to the week, and the free coffee is flowing.&nbsp; If I have a chance tonight maybe I will summarize what I have been to and what I learned.  &nbsp;  Cheers  G

        So as I sit on a plane, the panic Thursday seem so distant, but at the time it was hurry hurry hurry, flurry flurry flurry.&nbsp; Since the reason I am on this plane is that I am on the first leg of a two week expedition.&nbsp; The first leg takes me to Grapevine Texas, Grapevine is just outside of Dallas, so I will be landing in about 1.5 hours at Dallas Fortworth.&nbsp; The purpose of this part of the journey is to attend IBM Rational User Conference.&nbsp; A 5 day conference about software design with a UML/Model/SOA spin.&nbsp; I'm really excited, there are some great topics, and it is the first time I have been to Dallas (actually there are a LOT of places that I have never been, Dallas just happens to be probably the farthest I've travelled (either that or Calgary, but Calgary has Tim Horton's so it seems less exotic.)&nbsp; Anyways the conference is entirely paid for by my company, I just have to go there and learn.&nbsp; I get one day, today, to myself to see the place, so hopefully I will get a chance to go out on the town and have a look around.&nbsp; I have a strong encouragement from a guy at work to go to Resistol Arena for the Rodeo!&nbsp; I think I will look into it, but you won't catch me playing Cowboy poker anytime soon.&nbsp;The second leg of my Journey will be... Calgary, where I have in fact been once before, this time around it is for my brother's wedding.&nbsp; I will be going out direct from Dallas on Thursday, where I will meet up with the rest of my family, for what promises to be a great vacation, once we get past the wedding.&nbsp; I wish someone would listen to me when I say I'm scared out of my mind, I think I have more cold feet then the groom.&nbsp; You see the problem is, I am both the MC and the Best man, both of which involve an inordinate amount of public speaking, and at the moment I am stuck in a downward spiral of public speaking disaster.&nbsp; My last great performance was my OAC English ISU presentation, (that's Grade 13 Independent Study Unit in layman's terms.)&nbsp; Prior to that I acted in all sorts of school plays, but from that point on it all went down hill, each one worse then the last, until&nbsp; I got a C in first semester of forth year, and decided for the safety of my group I would run the computer during our Thesis presentation.&nbsp; It must have been the best run computer in the universe because it netted me a job interview with IBM, that didn't pan out to anything, but damn, that was so fly mouse work!&nbsp; So with this in mind I think this is how the cycle works.    10 presentationStress = 0;  20 assignedPresentation;  30 presentationStress ++;  40 presentationQuality = 1/presentationStress;  50 if(presentationQuality <> 60 else(presentationStress --);  70 goto 20.    So you see how this is a terrible loop, where quality continually gets worse, until at infinity the quality is 0!&nbsp; So at the moment my presentation stress is at about a million, so I am just a little nervous, I have sometime to prepare, but I thought I would share my jitters with the empty void. &nbsp;

       &nbsp;Went to see it on Tuesday with the parents, okay movie, not great but okay.&nbsp; A nice action-jackson historically inaccurate half epic, that had lots of sword fighting, so you won't hear me complain about it.&nbsp; I recommend watching it on cheap night or video, but its worth watching for fun.

       &nbsp;Catastrophe was averted as our project got the green light from the big boss today, it was a nervous one for EVERYONE, but it all worked out.&nbsp; I just had to get up at 5 am so I could be at work for 6:30 am.&nbsp; After the demo we went out for drinks to celebrate, in a bit of a Fruding slip my manager said, "This is a project is a career breaker or a career wrecker."&nbsp; He corrected himself so that they won't both negatives, but we had a good chuckle over it, because he to a certain degree is right, but today was a good day, and no need to gloom on what if's, especially not while things are going good.

       &nbsp;So a little fatigued on Thursday wasn't enough to stop me, well at least not completely stop me.&nbsp; I had intended to visit Erin in Guelph, but my parents wouldn't let me drive, they said I was too tired, I agreed and didn't fight them on the issue, so Erin came to visit me instead (she's so nice.)&nbsp; We just hung out that night and I got packed for the camping trip, which is the real meat of this blog entry.&nbsp;So the next morning, up early again for a shortened day of work, coming down to the wire, big due date coming up on the following Tuesday, so I was actually in pretty good shape for the due date but the tension in the office was palatable.&nbsp; In spite of that, I cut out early, (don't worry I still worked more then my 37.5 hours a week, actually, I don't think I have worked a week (on average) less then 40 hours in the last 4 months, and I don't begrudge that either, It means I am interested in my work and dedicated, but it also means I don't mind cutting out early on a Friday, actually I think it's a right that they should add that to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.&nbsp;So the reason for all this cutting out is the Camping Trip, the camping Trip was a sort of pre bachelor party for my buddy Rod who is getting married in November.&nbsp; (The following I am only writing because no one reads my blog, if you are reading my blog please don't read the following, Sara and Erin, DON'T READ THE FOLLOWING.)&nbsp; The description of this weekend Kevin (Rod's best friend and mutual school friend,) gave me for this weekend is as follows.&nbsp; "This is not a bachelor party, this is a chance for me to get to know Rod's friends from his home town, so when we are at the REAL bachelor and I am licking jello off a French Maid's Nipple, I know who the guy is licking off the other one, Capiech!"&nbsp; (Note Kevin isn't Italian...) &nbsp;Moving on, so the people at this thing were:&nbsp;Rod, aka the groom (no this isn't Kill Bill with gender roles reversed.)&nbsp;Kevin, as described above&nbsp;Brad, mutual school friend,&nbsp;Trevor, mutual school friend (Rod, Kevin, Trevor, Brad and I all went to McMaster for Software Engineering and were in all the same classes, studied together, partied together, and hung out in the lab for many all nighters together.&nbsp;Chris, who went to Mac for Software, was a year behind us, but shared a house with Rod, and was a cool guy.&nbsp;Martin, same as Chris.&nbsp;James, guy rod knows from home, they studied martial arts together.&nbsp; &nbsp;And now I'm getting a little fuzzy up top, there was 3 other guys, and they were cool guys, but I can't remember there names right now, maybe when I check my mail I will put them in.&nbsp;So what did we do that weekend?&nbsp;  What did we do that weekend?&nbsp; Well we went up to Arrowhead park, which is just outside of Huntsville, we shared two sites between the lot of us.&nbsp; It is a really nice park, clean, well organized, not cramped, I mean you wouldn't go there to do serious camping, but for car camping its perfect.&nbsp; So we set everything up so that there were three tents per site, but all the cooking and hanging out would occur at one site.&nbsp; Then we proceeded to hang out.&nbsp; We drank, told jokes, told stories, listened to some music, and had a good time, we cooked meat on an open fire, in the man way, and basically enjoyed the great weather.&nbsp; We went swimming and played Frisbee and beach volleyball, we also played 500 up with a small foot ball and in the lake, that was good times.&nbsp; Caught up on a little sleep and relaxed, good times!&nbsp; Sunday we came home, I unpacked, and collapsed, ready for a stress filled work week : )

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So going back to yonder days is going to be a little hard since a lot has happened since then, but lets see what I can remember.&nbsp; Now I think I already told you all about the walk over and dinner, but let me reiterate that dinner at the Lava Lounge was meh at best.&nbsp; The waitress was a little flaky and looked really weird.&nbsp; Its like she had all the elements of a person who could be very attractive in a neat pile before she left the house, and as she went to assemble then she tripped and got them all mixed up, and tilted.&nbsp; I don't want to slag the place to much more then that, but a review with out mentioning the food would be incomplete.&nbsp; The food was inexpensive and cheap, and burnt, but I guess if it is the Lava Lounge I should expect that, hard to control the temperature of a volcano...&nbsp;Now on to the show, or at least the venue, I will get to the show in a moment.&nbsp; So we walk from the lava lounge, and it's getting a little overcast, brad began what would become a repeated joke for the next while, and that was about rain.&nbsp; He insisted that the weather channel had indicated "No more then 1 millimetre of rain.&nbsp; So we are all in line in front of the place and it's getting gloomier and gloomier, and some one would say, "Don't worry there will be only 1 millimetre."&nbsp; Brad would chime in, "Less then 1, less then 1."&nbsp; Well it turns out both were wrong, because when the sky opened up, it got wet and FAST, fortunately we had partial shelter from a tree and they started letting people in, but I can assure you it was more then a millimetre.&nbsp;So the place the concert was held is called the Mod Club, which isn't the name of the building but some roaming entity that can be in any number of buildings, and that night it was in that building.&nbsp; I think, but I may be too uncool to get 'it,' but I think Mod stands for post modern, as in retro, and that would go along with the décor, very Austin Powersesc.&nbsp; My kind of place (for those who don't know it, Erin and I are definitely children of a different cultural era, but I wouldn't be willing to give up my technology era for my culture and style era, so we choose to have lots of electronic toys, and decorate in a way that pretty much offends the rest of the sensible world, but screw'm&nbsp; (well I guess that is you, and so I just said screw you, sorry.))&nbsp; Well that was a tangent; suffice it to say I liked the place.&nbsp; At the time we got in it was maybe at 1/8 of its capacity, what was great it was a club more then a concert hall.&nbsp; They had a stage at one end, an open floor in front of the stage, to the left was the main bar, and to the right was elevated area with a leaning rail and a bench of seats.&nbsp; That was just the main floor, behind the entrance was a set of stairs that went up to a balcony over the bar, from which you could sit and enjoy the show.&nbsp; It was full when we got there.&nbsp; So we lined up along the leaning rail, chilled and waited. &nbsp;So around 9:30 the Bare Naked Ladies role on to the stage with much fan fair and start into why they are here tonight.&nbsp; As it turns out Kevin Hurn, (sp?) who plays keyboard, mandolin, accordion and 'other' for the band, is like the biggest fan of the Nits.&nbsp; He attributes the Nits as one of his prime influences and an influence he has brought to the band.&nbsp; Now the Nits are about a 30-year-old band from Europe with little to no following in Canada, but Kevin heard they were doing a North America tour of small venues and Kevin wanted to give them an audience.&nbsp; So he, with the help of the band, put together the show I was at, the plan was BNL brings the audience and the Nits bring the music.&nbsp; So I think there was maybe 400 people for an awesome set by BNL, it was an acoustic set, and just fantastic, they joked, they had fun, and they were really back to there small venue roots, just a great show, they even had the Nits join in for their last song, can you blame them it was a great segway.&nbsp; &nbsp;When the Nits came on, I was a little disappointed with the audience; I really thought it was a part of the deal.&nbsp; BNL kindly does this AWESOME show, and then the audience stays around and gives the Nits a chance.&nbsp; To my disappointment, half the audience left nearly right away, what a bunch of jerks!&nbsp; So it took about 15-20 minutes for the crew to change over the stage, we all relaxed and then when the nits came back out, they kicked off into a great set of interesting music.&nbsp; I can definitely see some of BNL in the Nits, I guess I really mean I can see what part of the Nits that BNL has made a part of them, but I was a BNL fan first.&nbsp; A little more electronic then BNL, with synthesizers and sampling, but very fun and up beat, some funny songs some serious songs, just good stuff.&nbsp; My only complaint isn't about them, its really me, as they sing with a Dutch accent, it made it difficult for me to understand all the songs, but I could get the gist, and they had some great talent with the instruments as well.&nbsp;So the night ended the show was great, by the end their couldn't have been more then 50 people in the crowed and that included BNL because they came down to enjoy the show.&nbsp; (They just really really like them.)&nbsp; Kevin also got to play and sing with them.&nbsp;By around 12:00 or some I caught a cab with Brad and Jodi, and then a subway to union.&nbsp; I missed the 12:20 bus home and hung out in the station until 1:20.&nbsp; It was really funny because I watched these too really creepy/slimy Canadian's try and pick up these to tourists who couldn't speak English very well.&nbsp; They were surprisingly successful, like disgustingly so, but I never thought being a tourist made one a floozy, so I guess those guys just tried the right lines on the right pair of girls, in either case it provided me with an hour's amusement, it was sort of like a train wreck, you know is a terrible tragedy but you can't stop looking.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I got back to Mississauga around 2 - 2:30 I think, I was definitely in bed by 2:40, but the next day when the alarm went off at 6 am, I was exhausted!!!&nbsp; I think I survived Thursday, but I don't recollect, I probably turned on the music, and got the coffee flowing and turned of my cognitive abilities and just got some programming done.&nbsp;

       I went to a great concert last night featuring the Nits, and opening for them was BNL, I will talk all about it when I get the chance, but I don't have time as I'm running late for my train.  I just wanted to blog this before I forget, on the way to the concert my friends and I were about to cross a street when we simultaneously noticed the a) red light, b) 2 police officers on the corner.  So we stopped instead of jay walking, not that their was any traffic or anything.  The great part was, the cops jay walked, and as they passed us on our side of the street one of them said to us, "Well I guess I better right myself a ticket."  Then he smiled and kept going.  I nearly cracked up, but I thought better of laughing at / near the officer in case it got misconstrued as a request for a good night sticking.

       Here is a fast rant about my router table.  So I want a nice solid router table, good fence, something that will last, be comfortable to use, and more or less last me 10-15 years minimum.  I would also like this at a reasonable price, I say reasonable because I am willing to spend a little more to get quality.  So I buy one from crappytire (to non-Canadians Crappytire = Canadiantire = a large chain of stores which sell stuff like gardening equipment, tools, auto, sports houseware, and a few other things like that, it is like a department store with out the clothes, and twice the size.)  Back to the table at hand, the thing cost me a lot more then I wanted to spend, so much more that I'm embarrassed to say, I put it together and boom, this is when I find out I need to drill and tap the holes for the router interface myself.  Does this make anyone else nervous?  I'm a beginner sure I could do this, but I don't feel comfortable doing it.  In any case I am set on this course so manual makes a big hissy deal about 2 drill bits, one of which being a 3/4" steel countersink.  So I go back to Crappytire, and what do I find, they don't care the bit that their product (it was specifically a Canadiantire Housebrand product) requires.  What the bear?  So by the time I get home I decided to take the thing back I think there is a more reasonable table I can get from Rona (another hardware superstore, like Homedepot,) and it is predrilled for my router.  The whole affair is just maddening!

        urlLink CNN.com - Courier robots get traction in hospitals - July 6, 2004   Here is a pretty cool article about r2d2 sized robots at work in hospitals.  The future is now OOoOooOooooOO.  On topic of future, and computers and the such, my friend Chris and I had a discussion on where software technology was going, he was in favour of more embedded code programmed in C and the whole OO thing disappearing, where as I see service oriented architecture, model driven design and OO going forward.  In either case I don't think either of these fully describe the next paradigm, or perhaps don't even scratch the surface, I wish I could tell you what it would be, but then if I knew I would be rich!

       Nothing quite like a weekend of sleep, swimming and power tools.  That sums up most of the weekend, slept a lot, swam a lot.  I also used Erin's Father Bob's new power planer to strip a bunch of hand rails on the deck, and then Erin and I split the task of sanding them, and then Erin and her sister Candace painted them.  Then to add to my power tool joy I bought a new black and Decker 2 HP router and a palm sander.  The sales guy also threw in a bunch of bits for the router free, and I saved like 20% because the box was scuffed, oooo woop-di-freaking-do.  I figure the router will be a little scuffed too, its a power tool, not a ming vase!  Anyway that was my weekend and it was gooooood.

       Why in the whole damn 'verse of god aweful shows and crap tv, did Firefly get canned! I think that show was awesome from the get go, I just wish I had known about it when it was on TV.  The characters are well acted and loveable but deep.  The story intrieging, and the dialog great.  Effects, filming, everything just really really novel and amazing, and yet Fox cast it off like it was nothing.  Just makes you wonder.  I can't wait for the movie, due out in 05, I am definitly heading out to see it opening night, because I want to tell Joss, and the Crew of Serenity that I support them and their show!

       ...I'm going to try and remember and post as things pop into my head about the week in Calgary, mostly I was too busy enjoying myself, or nervous about MC'ing so its all a blur, but I will blog about what I can....  So the conference ended and I headed up to my room to pack up, and check out.  My flight from Dallas was scheduled for 4:30 pm.  I felt like I needed some lunch and I knew there was an airport shuttle at 1:00 pm, so I headed over early.    The self check out desk at the Dallas-Fortworth was a little confusing, they actually had 2 self checkouts, one with luggage, one without... Why...  Pearson has one set of self checkout lines, and an express baggage check for those who used it, it works well.  So I had to buffoon around in to many lines to get everything checked, and then on through security.    Security required me to take off my shoes, I guess shoe bombs are on the rise, oh well I got through no harm no fowl, I would rather be inconvenienced and safe.  So then I figured out where my gate was, and then went and grabbed a leisurely lunch.  Around 2:30 pm I mosied on over to my gate, and heard whispers of delays.  By 4:00 it was finally poster, our plane would be delayed 1 hour.    Then it was 1.5, 2, and finally 3.  The reason for the delay, tornadoes over Denver, and just my luck, I didn't have a direct flight to Calgary, I had a stop over in Denver.  At this point I was also worried about catching my transfer in Calgary.  So after many hours at the gate, my Gameboy dies, and my laptop dies.  I figured I had enough juice to get me to Calgary, but I didn't account for a 3 hour delay.  So just my luck I had also packed my books in my luggage... Never do that again.  We finally left Dallas at about 7:10, so just shy of a full 3 hours, and the ride to Denver was unexciting at best.  The landing was a little scary, see I am the kind of guy who listens to the pilots with my courtesy head set, and so I am hearing them as they make there final approach, and all I see out the window is clouds, clouds, clouds, clouds, clouds, clouds, GROUND!!!!!!  We broke final cloud cover about 10-15 meters up feet up and 100 meters out from the run way.  I'm glad they knew what they were doing because that was just freaky.  So we land at the wrong end of Denver and I have to hoof it clear across the terminal  to the gate for my Calgary departure, fortunately it hadn't left yet, by the time I get there, I am greeted with my friend... The delay.  See Denver was pretty much shut down for about 5 hours, and that creates a big back log, so the place was crammed, and my plane hadn't even landed, never mind groomed, or fueled.  Fortunately I found a plug, and jacked in.  Juiced up my laptop and gameboy, and had an engaging conversation with a nice American lady headed to Calgary for... A wedding.  Actually we didn't talk about wedding's at all, we talked about Canada and its CrAzY > 2 party political system.  Fortunately she was intelligent and just uninformed, so I didn't just tell her about it we discussed, so it passed the time.    We finally left Denver at 10:10, I think I slept most of the flight, I lucked out and actually had the only row with an empty seat, so it wasn't to squishy, I could have used less screaming baby, but what you going to do about that.    Landed in Calgary about quarter to one (which if I have my time zones right was actually quarter to two,) got picked up by my lovie, and my parents, and then dropped off at the house I was staying in, ironically didn't get to meet the owner of the house since she had gone to bed, and I didn't even get to meet them the next day, because totally drained as I was I slept in.  So that was my travel experience, and what an experience, I will elucidate more of the fun stuff in the near future but for now, I sleep.  jetlagged geoff

       Here is  urlLink another article  for you people to read.  This one is about RSDUC, and features me, in fact it features a lot of me.  I don't want to be vain, but I don't get quoted often, or ever, and often find myself quoting others, so today I shall strut and preen about.  Enjoy

        urlLink    Well I am back from my brother's wedding, and aside from no internet, I have a lot to tell.  To start with here is one of the millions of pictures we took, from the look of things I would say this is probably Moraine Lake, I'm not going to go into a lot of details about the trip right now, but I will over the next few weeks post all sorts of pictures.  Enjoy this one for now, and I will fill in the details soon.
