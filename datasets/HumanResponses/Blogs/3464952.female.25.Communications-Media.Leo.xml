       Welcome.  This is my brand new blog.  I used to have a blog at http://fcprincesse.diaryland.com.  It's still up there, but I officially ended it a while ago because it served its purpose and wasn't doing anything for me.  It was my way of staying in touch with people from home and chronicling my journey through graduate school.  But... graduate school being over, and having started a new job, I didn't have the heart to keep it up.  This is going to be a different sort of blog with a different sort of purpose.  I didn't talk about my faith very much in my last blog, but I plan to use this blog almost exclusively for that.  I want to track the growth in my relationship with Christ, and talk about the things I am learning from the bible and about God from other people.  I also want to talk about the ways God is using me in other people's lives, although not necessarily with too much detail because I don't want to encroach on other people's privacy.   Although more details about my faith will be clarified later, the most important are:  - I am a Bible-believing born-again Christian - I attend a Fellowship Baptist in the Windsor area of Ontario - The Bible is the sole basis of my faith.  I believe that every word is God-breathed, and that everything happened in history as it is described there (yes, I even believe that the earth was created in seven days) - I believe that Jesus Christ died for my sins on Calvary, rose again on the third day, and ascended into Heaven, all of this so that I, and anyone else who chooses to believe in Him can later join Him there  Please take notice that although this is what I believe, and my faith is very strong, I recognize that many, many other people completely disagree with me.  Of course, I hope that others would take up these beliefs, but at the same time, I believe that it is every person's choice.  I will not ridicule or talk down to anyone about it, and I hope for the same from others.    I am more than happy to discuss what I believe in a one-on-one correspondence, but I ask that there be an openmindedness about it.  I know that Christians get a bad reputation for being close-minded, and I am sorry for that, since it is not our position to judge others, but at the same time, many Non-Christians are also incredibly close-minded and intolerant of Christians.  Just as some people who claim to be Christians are persecuting Non-Christians for lifestyle choices of all sorts, many Christians are also persecuted by Non-Christians for what they believe, even if that persecution is only in the form of belittlement.  I hope and pray that this blog will give encouragement to others.  If it positively impacts even one life, then I will be more than happy.
