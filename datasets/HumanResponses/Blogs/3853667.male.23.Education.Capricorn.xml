      Recently I was ill, and unable to talk.&nbsp; Being a naturally garrulous person I found this experience of enforced silence both illuminating and frustrating.    I never before realized how much importance we put on the function of speech and how hard it is to communicate with anyone when you are unable to speak.&nbsp; I guess in a way I was lucky, my flatmate and I are able to sign a little, so we got by, at least on the very basics of things.&nbsp; But it was still more or less impossible to carry on any sort of conversation, with sign language we, at best, communicated basic need and desire, yet any concept beyond, "Can I have a tissue", seemed too hard to get across.  This is something I have never considered before, our limitations within the structures of communication are vast, once vocal options are unavailable.&nbsp; Having taken various classes at University on communication (thus, wrongly, thinking I knew all about communication) it was a shock to learn, that, even with the most advanced paralinguistics, speed of writing, etc, that the reliance on speech, in myself at least, was not utilitarian, but necessary.  Being unable to express myself at all, led to me giving up even trying to do so.&nbsp; The immense sense of frustration and futility seemed overwhelming whenever I tried to communicate.&nbsp; A harsh time for a non-stop talker.....  But consider, what would your lives be like, if you could not talk.&nbsp; I had a look, and I didn't like it.  &nbsp;  till l8r  xag

      Has anyone ever found that when they most need to think, the capacity of thought seems to have abandoned them entirely?  In a recent encounter I was left with many questions about myself and the way I percieved the world around me.  Someone, namely a very irritating, but well loved flatmate, forced me to have a look at some of the things that I take for granted about myself, and see that, in all fact that these things do not really exist.  It makes one wonder, how much of what we take for granted about ourselves truly exists?  Take a look, and see if you don't mentally freeze up as the status quo is altered.

       urlLink The Witches Secret   This is a website for all the aussie pagans out there!  The actual physical location of the shop is near to where I live, so I have seen the great stuff they have as well as talked to the owner, who, incidentally has a good knowledge of the craft!   This is not for the incidental dabbler in the pagan arts, but is good for beginners, as well as the experienced.  Take a look and enjoy!  I did. Till l8r xag

      Welcome to my first Blog.  I'm going to use this as my site for views on the world, technological advancements, political views and random rants as time permits.  I invite and encourage any and all viewpoints and will respond to as many of them as I can, just keep it clean and on the subject being discussed and we'll all get along fine!  Just a little about myself.  I am a 23 year old Australian with a great deal of time on my hands to think, despite studying a Bachelor of Education full time.  My interests are varied and I have a sort of amateur jack-of-all-trades knowledge of a lot of things.  So feel free to tell me if I get something wrong, it won't be the first or last time I am wrong, so bear with me.    I'd really like to encourage the interest of those with political ideas (not ideals or fanaticism) to discuss their thoughts as I have some of my own ideas for a new form of governance.  I'd also like to have a scientific forum occur debating the uses and value of new technologies as they are researched and become available without the windy moralising attached to such technologies as genetic engineering by most in the scientific community seem to be doing.  So this is it, hopefully a blog that will stimulate thought, conversation and maybe a debate or two.   Till l8r! xag
