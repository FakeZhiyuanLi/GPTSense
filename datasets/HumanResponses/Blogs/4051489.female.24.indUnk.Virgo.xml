      I have to have a permission slip form my doctor to have sex.  God that sucks.  Okay, I'm exagerrating, it's not jsut to have sex, it's to procreate.  Back in April I had another rupture.  This one wasn't as bad as the one I had a few years back at work (Lying on the concrete floor, completely blacking out from pain, screaming the whole time in the ambulance), but this one was still bad.  It was so sudden.  I had popped Anthony into his playpen, about to head into the kitchen for a cup of coffee and then BAM!  I was on the floor, grabbing my side, swooning from the stabbing pain.  It was the left one again.  This one sucked though, because I was home alone with Anthony.  I didn't want to call 91, because what would happen to my baby?  Who would watch him while they poked and prodded Mommy?  I crawled to the phone and called Rick, but he didn't answer his work line.  I panicked.  I called Tracy, as I knew she had his pager number (I didn't), and she could come get Anthony while I went to the ER, but she wasn't home.  I left a message, sobbing, into his voice mail.  Luckily, he had just gotten out of a meeting, got the message, and flew home.  Tests at Er showed that the hemmorage wasn't too bad.   So, the permission slip issue comes in now because Rick and I are really wanting to try for number #2.  But since this rupture happened, my doc said no trying for at least 3 menstrual cycles.  The scarring on my ovary could cause problems, like an ectopic, not to mention it could cause a serious miscarriage.  So, no babies for us... Well, it's been four cycles!  I get to go get checked up in August to get the go ahead.  I she says all's well, I won't be writing in here much because I'll be too busy having sex.

      Well, I don't really need to go back to work, but there's been some financial strain in the Spangler household that has caused me to seriously consider getting an evening job. 1.) Rick and I fight all the time about finances, particularly about his stronghold on our money, refusing to let me spend a dime, or have a voice in our money (groceries even!). 2.)  We are in desperate need of some major household purchases:  New computer (ours is a dinosaur gasping on lifesupport),  New couch (not only is ours broken in several places, but the cats have peed all over one side of it),  Bed for Anthony (outgrowing the crib),  Entertainment center (our current one is soooooooo not childproof),  Display shelves for the collections (to hang above Anthony's reach to protect them) New Car Seat (Anthony's outgrowing the infant seat quickly) Car Repairs (Because the fuckwad who hit us hasn't paid on the judgement) 3.) I'd like my own spending money, particularly come holiday season.  Honey, I'd love to buy you a gift, so give me your credit card...well, now that just don't fly, now does it? So, anyways, I went to interview at this legal copy center, one that I had applied for a long time ago and had gotten an offer, but wasn't in a position to accept at the time.  Since that first interview had gone so well (I was insanely over qualified for the job, but I didn't mind, the work environment seemed nice), I figured this would be a slam dunk.  Well, the guy that interviewed me was a raging ASSHOLE.  He kept saying I didn't know anything, no matter how many times I spelled out my extensive experience.  I could fucking MANAGE that place, and he's telling me I'd have to have a trial run to 'see if I can figure out a copy machine'?!?!?!?!  I could take almost any copier apart and put it back together faster than most techs, but this twit says it'll take me 3 months to 'get the hang of using one'.  Then, if I was lucky, I could be moved 'upstairs with the boys to learn scanning'.  Learn Scanning?!  I did prepress, typesetting, and graphic design for YEARS.  He kept saying my experience was just like 'the kids who come in with a few months at kinko's...' what the fuck ever.  That's like telling someone who studied Culinary Arts at the Courden Bleu (sp?) in Paris that they might as well have worked the register at McDonalds...I may sound cocky, but damnit, I have a right to be.  I graduated top of my class at only 18 years old...from COLLEGE.  I was successfully handling the  marketing & design for a major company here in Seattle by age 20.  I worked with some of the best press operators on the West Coast learning the gears.  Kiss my ass I don't have experience!  It took every bone in my body from going seriously Italian on this fuck's behind. Now, I knew that re-entering the job market would be tough, especially after a two year absence, not to mention my time being a stripper in between 'real jobs'.  I am totally cool with working at a retail job or something, couldn't give a fuck if I was only scrapping in $8 an hour, but I will NOT work for some arrogant sexist shithead who is going to treat me like a moron.  As vehemenantly anti-Kinko's as I am, I would prefer to work for that printing chop shop than deal with that bullshit. Luckily, when Rick heard about the nightmare I had to deal with, he said we'll seriously re-evaluate the need for me returning to work.  Thank GOD he's finally becoming understanding!

      Well, I know Dom's probably cursing under his breath that I didn't go to the theater the very opening day of this flick (hey, gimme a break, kid, remember?).  We rented it the very first day it came out, kay? I liked it, nice little flick.  Great special effects!  Since Dom never got to force feed me the comic book, I can only surmise as to how close to the story it stuck.  I'll have to pick his brain later, as there were a few things I am needing background on to fully grasp it all.  But can someone please explain why the HELL (pardon the ironic word choice) there were Gerald McBoing Boing cartoons on the DVD???  Even that seems a bit far reaching for fanboi stuff.  So, for the winning snicker bar....how many people sat there with that annoying "who is that...I recognize the voice..." tick going through there heads.  I suck at voice recog, but that one was itching in my head the whoooooooooooole time.  Conveniently, they left the voice credit OFF, simply noting the physical character as some random guy.  So, I, being the obsessive I am, had to go digging on the internet.  Thank god for IMDB, right?  David Hyde Pierce!  Frasier inexplicably cute and dorky younger brother!!!  I knew that friggin voice was familiar!!!!!!

      *sigh*...Anthony's in a nap war again...  Do you ever find yourself obsessively checking out certain physical features on other people that are on yourself otherwise flawed?  I'm not talking about if you hate your haircut you look at other hairstyles...I mean if you have a huge nose that you are not happy with, so therefor you are constantly noticing the shape of other people's noses.  You'll stare at how theirs fits on their face perfectly like Jessica Simpson. I do this, not the nose though.  Maybe if you don't and I do it's because I'm 'priviledged' to have an extremely fucked up physical feature that bothers me deeply.  My teeth.  Before I got the porcelain amalgam put on the front ones, it looked like an acid-tripping ice sculpture had taken a pick to my front teeth hap-hazardly.  The dentist filled in the rough spots, and I was able to smile for a while.  But then when I was pregnant, I lost one of my canines, and then shortly after giving birth the crown on my front incisor fell off.  So I'm missing two teeth near the front and am back to being ashamed. I've mastered the subtle art of turning my head down and covering my face when I laugh, and speaking with as little of my choppers showing as possible.  Not many really notice it.  But some people do.  I hate the fact that people, even my 'friends', think I don't know I have bad teeth.  Like I could not fucking notice every time I look in the mirror.  Like I don't pick up on the slight cringe and shock if I do smile openly.  The few who think that speaking up might be 'helpful', the enevitable comment of "Have you ever thought of getting your teeth fixed?" that pops up is what is the worst.  Like, no I haven't, I like fucking having this shit going on in my mouth, barely able to eat solid foods, too embarrassed to smile in public.  I just happen to have the $40,000 it'll require to fix them properly, but I wanted to spend it on shoes.  Pardon the irony, but BITE me. Enamel Genesis Imperfecta.  That's what the doctor finally explained to me.  It's a condition formed at birth, but not apparent until all the adult teeth are in, and by then, it's usually too late.  The teeth come in without enamel on them, not properly anyways.  If you could see enamel like you could see paint, mine would look like a really shitty primer job on a white trash camero, uneven, flaky, and missing in many spots.  My teeth came in unprotected by several layers of enamel that normal people have, and thus, they didn't have a fighting chance at surviving past my early adulthood.  I just got to enjoy a few years with exposed tooth pulp in my mouth, highly sensitive, easily stained, and constantly breaking and chipping.  Doc says one by one my teeth will be replaced with implants as the years go on.  it's better than dentures, apparently.  But five times as expensive, so I'll get like 1 new tooth per year or something, and pray to god the others don't fall out too quickly.   She's giving me this thing called a 'flipper', which will fit into my mouth like a retainer.  It'll have little fake teeth in it to replace the ones in front I am missing, so I can kinda look normal again.  I cried when she showed it to me.  I get it on August 11th, so I'll post a picture when that happens.  Can you believe I've avoided having my picture taken since my son was born?  if he looks back through his childhood photos, I wonder if he'll be curious about where Mommy was.  Is 'hiding my face' a viable answer?

      Well, for the thousands of surveys they have there, I only found two that were cool.  This one is long, but very interesting...I warn ya, some of the questions were obviously written while SEVERELY intoxicated...you may just not want to answer them.  1. Have your parents ever used those sticky mouse traps before where the mouse gets caught and suffers until someone comes and twists it's poor little neck? did you feel intensly bad for the mouse? did you try to free it? If none of this applies to you..please describe any other mouse fiasco you have had (or make one up)  Yup, my parents used those. Since they were all over the bottom section of the house that I lived in, I would meticulsously check them so I could liberate the mousies before they died.   2. Describe yourself as you would to a therapist ("so tell me, who ARE you as a person, really?)  Hmmm..that's a toughy. I'm an impassioned democrat, but middle of the road liberal, I constantly look to learn, I've suffered boughts of low self esteem, I'm a fiercely protective mother, I'm a loner with outgoing tendencies...   3. what is your favporite food and what does it say about your personality?  Hmmm...I love too many different foods. I love pasta, especially pesto sauce on Angel hair...and I looooooooove chocolate. I don't think it says much about my personality. Maybe that I'm an Italian with a sweet tooth?  4. What do you think you were in a past life? Do not believe in reincarnatation?If so, tell me about your mother.  I'm actually supposed to have a pastlife regression coming up soon, so I'll get back to you on that one.   5. Now name the thing that if someone dressed up as, you would have an intense and deep desire to have their child   Jack Skellington. Or a cook's uniform.  I swear for some reason those checked pants and white coat are hypnotizing for me.  6. would you rather be a werewolf, a vampie, a mummy, or a water fowl? explain the benifits of your choice.  hmmm...a vampire I suppose would be good because I'm a nightowl, and a quasi-goth, but I can't stand the sight of blood, so that could be a hinderance. I don't care too much for large breed dogs, so I don't think I could be a werewolf (unless I could morph into a pug or dachsaund). Couldn't do mummy, I'm claustrophobic, so I'd never stay in my tomb. Water fowl...I'm terrified of water, but I'd love the flying part. Plus, feathers are always in fashion.   7. If you had to mate with an alien from star trek or star wars to create an ultimate crossbreed which would save the universe, which species would you pick?  I never watched star trek enough to know all the breeds of folks. I suppose a Betazoid (or whatever that counselor chick was), and a vulcan, so I could read people's minds and tell them why their thoughts aren't logical.   8. if some kind of food had to be named after Jesus, which would it be?  Dark Belgian Chocolate. I'd praise that anyday!!!   9. Are you insulted at the idea of naming a food after Jesus?   Nah, just cause I was raised catholic doesn't mean I'm a very good catholic.   10. When yuo played Mash as a prepubescent, what stuff did you always have listed on it? What was always your worst option for each category? if never played Mash, make stuff up.    What's MASH?   11. If you were the author of those crazy tabloid magazines that are entirely bulllshit, what kind of crazt stuff would you make up to write about? Which celebrities would you scandalize? Would you make lots of money? If so, would you donate it to cute fuzzy animals?  That Christina Aguilara chick would suffer at the fate of my pen. And Jessica Simpson, although it doesn't take much to make her look silly. I would make lots of money, and donate it to some fuzzy animals, and ignore others that weren't fuzzy enough.   12. what is your favorite kind of cute fuzzy animal?   my cats. I love them, they drive me crazy, and they are both thoroughly fuzzy.   13. What would you rather wake up to find next to your bed, a ghost or an alien?   a ghost, definitely, because the whole alien one I'd be wondering just where the probes went.   14. what would be the worst possible experiment and alien could do to you?  make me listen to boy band music for several hour stretches.   15. If said alien did an anal probing on you, what would they find? (be creative!)   Last night's dinner?   16. Ok is that question way to gross? Do you feel tickly inside thinking about it?  ew.   17. Who do you know who would best fits the title of "gooey she-monkey"? Describe this person.   I will not say her name, except that I know her via a relative. She's an ickypoo nasty person, who lives on welfare and doesn't deserve to have children.    18. Ok, the word "sex" was in the title of this survey, so I will throw in a sex question. When, how and to whom did you are do you want to lose your virginity? How was it? HOw do you wish it was?   I lost it to my best friend's brother when I was 15, on a whim, and it was...un-moving, shall we say. I remember thinking, what's all the fus about?   19. Now for the generic question. What is your favorite cd/band/singer/music in general?    AAAAAAaach, too many to list.   20. Now, what thing would you most like to do while listening to this music that is naughty, bad, evil, or insane?  Fuck or dance, what else is there?   21. If it had anything to do with aliens mentioned in questions past, please leave me a note. Hm..I suppose I should throw in another generic question here. What is your sexuality? I don't want to know anything about beasties or babies, so just leave you animal and small child fetishes out of it.   I'm straight-ish. Thoroughly expored my girl-luvin side, and enjoyed it mucho. But I never really saw myself having a relationship beyond sexual with another woman, so I guess that makes me straight.   22. If you HAD to do it with a person of whichever sex you don't prefer, who would it be? describe them, as I may not know you and thus would have no idea who you were talking about if just given a name. And if you are Bi, hmm... Just don't answer the question.    OKay, I won't answer it then...  23. Which famous person would you have to be stuck entirely alone on the planet with to kill yourself immediately upon finding out they are all the company you would have for the rest of eternity and probably expected you to repopulate the earth?  Kevin Nealon, formerly of Saturday Night Live. I don't think he's funny, and he's pretty damn icky looking.   24. Who would you have liked to repopulate the earth with (if your are gay, imagine this is by the time when humans have evolved to be able to reproduce with people of the same sex)   Other than the obligatory response of "My husband, of course!", I'd have to say Orlando Bloom. That man is tooooooo dang pretty. There's a few other men in the world I know of that would make repopulation a very fun process, but since I have that obligatory response above, I shall not mention them.  25. Describe what sort of girl/guy you are most attracted to. BE totally honest. And when I say that, I mean looks entirly, no personality traits.   Smaller framed, ie lightweights. Must have a tatoo somewhere on their body. Doesn't matter what colour eyes, as long as they are very pretty ones. Long, delicate fingers...purrrr....   26. Now describe whichever of your parents is the saqme sex as the people you are attracted to in general. Both if you are bi.   huh? don't get that one...don't think I want to...  27. Now tell me, was Freud right about the whole thing about people being attracted to people look like their opposite sex parent in appearence? It counts even if it is just the same eye and hair color.   nope, not at all.   28. What do you think of Dr. Freuds Penis envy theory? If you are a guy, I don't want you to answer this. Instead tell me, if you had your penis ripped off in a freak accident or any other way, would you live the rest of your life as a man who lost his best buddy...or would you have the rest of your manly accesories hacked off, get breast implants, and run around wearing fish-nets until you died?   again, huh?   29. If your life were an epic tale, would it be science fiction or fantasy? What sort of non-human would be your forbidden lover? In what extemely dramatic way would you DIE?   I'd want it to be a fantasy, though in reality I'd be a friggin dramatic comedy...give me an elf (Tolkien version, not Keibler) and I'd be a happy girl. Hmmm...dramatic death? I suppose left to a desireably attractive mad scientist to 'do what he will'.   30. Which LOTR orgy would you prefer...hobbits, elves, royal humans, or black riders?    ELVES!!! I swear, was there a single ugly one in the group? nope.

      well, most of their user made surveys were stupid, but here's one I liked.  Feel free to copy the questions and answer them for yourself.  1. If you could spend one uninterupted hour today with any person alive, who would it be? Why? What would you do or discuss? Why?    Tim Burton, and we'd discuss art. I just think he's be a very interesting person to discuss impressionism with.    2. Which work or home responsibilities do you find most fulfilling? Which do you find most frustrating?   Being a mother is the most fulfilling job in the world. Considering 'play time' is an actual requirement of our daily grind, how cool is that?! Frustrating would be diaper time. If you've ever tried to change a 1 year old that loves crawling, you know exactly how frustrating it is. Why don't they make mini straight jackets for this?!   3. If you could do anything in the world, and be certain of success, what would you do?    Open up a restaurant with my husband and my father. It's been a family dream for the three of us. There's a friend of mine who I'd also have to drag out of hiding to come work with us.  I sometimes consider him to be my sanity, and I would have to have him there...by gunpoint if necessary...He knows who he is.  4. If you and your significant other were stranded on an island for one month, what topic would you most like to discuss?   what would I WANT to discuss, or what would we INEVITABLY discuss? trust, these are two very different things. I'd want to discuss our son, future family plans, what kind of house we want to buy. What we'd end up discussing is why we're so damn broke and why money sucks.   5. Is there a topic you would avoid?  Our marriage problems.   6. Besides the necessities of food, clothing, and shelter, what would you most want to have with you?   other than the obvious 'a raft' answer, probably a PS2 with a bunch of 2 player games.   7. If you became more rich than you could imagine today, what would you want to do with the money?   pay off debt, right off. get a respectable home (not Bill Gates ridiculously big, but something we could have a larger family in). Open a restaurant and possibly my own boutique. Pay for private school for our son.   8. If your house caught on fire (and everyone was safely out,) what three things would you most want to save? Why?   do my cats count as 'everyone'? okay, then beyond them, I'd just say my photo albums/home videos (which are conveniently in one box for that very reason), my 6' yall Jack Skellington, the Oogie Boogie doll my husband hid my ring in when he proposed.   9. What things about yourself do you treasure? Is there something that you think you should apreciate more in yourself?   see, if you answer it, your conceited, if you don't, it's false modesty. Aha, there's my treasured trait...the ability to dodge questions!   10. What would you still like to learn to do? Why?   There's so many things I want to learn! How to knit, how to cook chinese food, caligraphy, how to program in SQL, how to make my own puppets...   11. If you could suddenly possess an extrodinary talent in one of the arts, which would you like it to be?   I already do, silly! J/k...I'd like to know how to create puppets actually, and entertain children/adults alike.   12. If you had to define love in a few simple words or actions, how would you do it?    when life just makes sense that way.   13. If you could physically transport yourself to any place in the world at this moment, where would you go?  Reno, NV. I'm really friggin hungry and I'm remembering this killer endless Buffet down there at the Atlantis.   14. If you had to select the sexiest word in the English language, what would you pick?    caress.   15. If you had to name the one thing that frightens you most about growning old, what would it be?   knowing I will lose my father sooner rather than later.   16. If you could hear the deathbed confessions of one person from history, who would you pick?    Van Gogh. Why exactly did he cut off that damn ear?!   17. If you had to pick the most sensual part of your own body, what would you pick?   my back. It's delicately tatooed for a reason.   18. If you had the power to hypnotize anyone for a day, who would you pick and what would you have them do?  this answer could be far too x-rated...it would involve Orlando Bloom and would be MUCH longer than a measly 24 hours... Seriously, I'd hypnotize my hubby to bring me home cigarettes and dinner, then hand me the plastic to go shopping with more than a pathetic $20 limit that I can spend on MYSELF.   19. If you had to chose the one thing that gives you the most comfort, what would it be?    My son. No matter how bad I feel about myself or the world around me, nothing matters when I'm around him.   20. If you had to give up your favorite food forever, what's the minimum amount of money you would demand in return?   I don't necessarily have an all time favourite, so this is not really applicable.   21. If you learned there actually was a Heaven and Hell, what's the first thing you'd change about your life?  nothing, I think I am living a fairly decent life.   22. If your soul was a color, which color would it be?  The colour of purple you see last during a sunset.   23. What's your favorite number? Is there a reason for it?   The number three, it's little and odd, much like myself.   24. If you had to name the one most important ingredient of human beauty, what would you say it is?    humanity.   25. If you could have any room in the world become your bedroom from now on, which room would you choose?   hmmm...whichever celebrity on 'Cribs" has an Xbox and PS2 in his bedroom, minibar, huge bed with lotsa pillows, and a jacuzzi.   26. If you were a natural phenomena, which would you be? If you were a mythological being, which would you be? If you were a metal, which would you be? If you were a sensation, which would you be?   I'm leaving that one alooooooooone.   27. What is the best example of perfection that you can think of?  A 'Black Magic' rose   28. What's the strongest craving you get?   normally, it's when I crave a hamburger for no reason. When I was pregnant, that whole craving system was just SCARY!   29. You discover your wonderful one-year-old child is, because of a mixup at the hospital, not yours. Would you want to exchange the child to try to correct the mistake?    no, I love my son because I've raised him as mine. Although I'd want him to be able to eventually meet his biological parents.   30. If Jesus showed up on your doorstep and offered to answer any one question, what would you ask?   Where the hell have YOU been?!  no seriously, I'd probably ask if we as a society will ever get better?

      2004-07-09 - 2:42 p.m.  hmmm..son is sleeping, I am bored...  I remember back on the old site I used to post on (wahm is evil, please remember that), a friend of mine started a 10 things that annoy me, and 10 things that make me happy thread. Since I'm sure it's been deleted, I should create my new lists.                              10 Things That Annoy Me  1. websites that claim to be nonbiased, yet skewer and allow others to dissimate anyone who isn't in their way of thinking...  2. liberals who automatically assume all conservatives are 'uninformed' and then proceed to crame usless information down their throats (and hey, I am a liberal).  3. People who assume that a person who is young and 'alternative' must be completely clueless about being a parent.  4. CD wrappers.  5. No store in Washington sells Gerber Simple recipe foods.  6. My neighbors. They are the spawn of something far worse than Satan.  7. People who use the U-Scan line at the grocery store but are too stupid to figure out this simple device. GET IN THE OTHER DAMN LINE!!!  8. People who think I've never heard the song My Sharona, so they must sing it to me...off key...all the damn time.  9. Weather Reports on TV that are completely and ridiculously wrong.  10. Bad Thai Food.   And 10 Things that Make Me Happy  1. Watching my son talk to himself in his mirror.  2. Getting a hug and giggle for no reason.  3. A great cup of coffee.  4. Sales on baby food.  5. People who accurately guess my son's sex and age on the first try.  6. My husband bringing home dinner without me asking him to.  7. Gooooooooooooood nookie.  8. Nightmare Before Christmas toys.  9. Jim Hensen  10. The image of blowing up a local Hot Topic.

      originally written 2004-07-08 - 12:20 p.m.  Ahaaaa...finally joined a blogging community. Well, at least this will be a healthy way to kill off my free time instead of being a serial poster on message boards. BEWARE...I'm a babbling queen, and notably outspoken...I have a feeling that this diary may be rant filled.  Hmmm...who am I? I'm a girl, that should hopefully be obvious. Well, actually woman, going on 25 I don't think allows me to stick with a child's moniker anymore...sigh...  I'm married, to my hubby Rick, for 2+ years now. We've been together for almost 4. He's older than me, 30, but looks younger. He works at a hospital in the food services department, as a purchasing supervisor. He's always been a chef/cook, and is loving being on the paper pushing end for a change. We met on the internet, while he lived in Kentucky and I lived here. We couldn't stand being so far apart, and he decided to pack up and haul out here. A one way ticket on greyhound was all we needed, we were set for life.  I'm not a native Washingtonian, I was born in Southern Cali, raised in Northern. I'm born of immigrant parents, and I'm proud of my Italian via Canadian heritage. Went to college in Sacramento, then in SF (Art major, graphic design). I worked in the field for a while, biut got sick of it. Oh yeah, and when the economy up here went SPLAT, there was no work in it anyways, so I became a stripper/web porn performer for a spell. Hey, rent was expensive! That's actually how hubby found me. It's a fucked up little love story, and I don't recommend to anyone to look for true love in this fashion. We were just VERY lucky.  Anyhoo, we married in 2002, while I had taken time off from nakedness to sell commercial printing. That didn't last more than 2 years though, so shortly after our nuptials, it was back to the pole dancing I went. It must've amped up my fertility or something, because six months later I was prego-rama.   Ironically, we were able to patch up the trouble spots in our marriage after we discovered our impending family addition. So, I guess we did everything the opposite of normality...met on the internet and worked out, having a baby helped repair our rocky marriage...  Oh yeah, what now for the artistically inclined nude lover? Well, I'm a stay at home mom actually. I work part time from home for a fundraising group, but my primary job function is mommy.  So, that's my life, in a nutshell...

      Well, now several people I know are using this blog service, so I guess it's time to switch.  I didn't like the one I was using, too clunky and teen-esque.  I'll transfer my previous few entries over, pretend like I actually write stuff that's worthwhile. I don't really get to write much.  Half the time of my days is spent peeling Anthony off the couch.  Then when he naps I get to make my work calls and get treated like a friggin telemarketer.  Yip.  Well, I'll go get my other posts now.

      WARNING: THIS POST IS NOTHING BUT A SELF-LOATHING, SELF-PITYING EXTRAVEGANZA.  READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Okay, a little explanation on the post below.  I have come to not enjoy my brtihdays over the past...let's see, 7 years now?  It's not a whole 'getting older' thing, I could frankly care less about that yet.  25's not really that old, and since hubby will always be 6 years older, I get to claim baby status.  It's how much this supposedly 'joyfilled' day always ends up being completely lame and depressing for me.   A lot of it is due to my severe antisocial nature.  I have a hard time making friends, so my social circle is a barren place.  Especially in more recent times, being a stay at home mom isn't exactly conducive to social interractions. A look back at a history of crappy ass b-days...   18th birthday - was in the process of moving from a hated town, but no one that was there knew I still was (or they didn't give a shit).  One friend showed up at my place that night and took me to go buy a lottery ticket and cigarettes.  The next day I got b-day nookie in the middle of Folsom River from a guy I was on-off with all summer.  Exhibitionist?  Why, thank you. 19th birthday - I was still fairly new to the area, and too busy working corporate life to go out and have fun.  Besides, what the hell does one do on their 19th friggin' birthday?  I think I got a card from my boss. 20th birthday - would've been okay, although I found out my 'loving boyfriend' had to drag my close friend at the time out shopping because he had no clue what to get me.  The awesome Angel statue he gave me and my favourite flowers totally lit up my life, until I found out he was taking credit for Dom's work.  That was also the weekend that asshole (not Dom, but the now ex) moved in and proceeded to dessimate my life as I knew it. 21st birthday - oooooooooh, this one was a doozy.  I had actually planned a fairly large party, due to all my work friends 'promising' to attend.  At my table for 18, my 5 actual friends had plenty of room to spread out.  Laurel (supposed best friend at the time) bitched the whole time because she couldn't go drinking with us, but was planning on leaving for Ireland the following day anyways so would only stay for the free meal.  Poor Dom and Becca desperately tried to lighten my dwindling mood by bar hopping.  By the time we got to the Mercury I was fairly intoxicated, but it was quickly brought down by my then recent ex's (see asshole noted above) best friend coming up and feeling the need to attempt a deep conversation about the recently vacated terd.  Not exactly a choice topic for discussion to me.  I went home, threw up, and grumbled myself into bed. 22nd - Thank god I was with Rick.  No friends that year acknowledged it. 23rd - 5 stripper friends dragged me out on the Ballard bar crawl.  5 days later I found out I was pregnant.  This birthday was actually okay. 24th - Again, thank god I'm married and have parents, or this day would've once again passed without a card. 25th and presently happening in two weeks - Dom's in Frisco, I don't talk to Laurel anymore, and severed ties with Crystal recently as well (she couldn't stop shit talking Rick, despite how well we're doing, so I finally gave up on associating with her).  Stripper friends turned out to be fair weather friends, I only still talk to one, and she's insanely busy with her life.  Tracy's never around, so that leaves...ding! My husband once again to carry my social life as I know it.  I'm not totally alienated from the world, I do talk to a few gals I met on the net and we sometimes hook up with our kids.  But these aren't people who know me well enough to go baking me a cake or anything.  I may call Nico & Eileen to at least go have a drink somewhere so I don't feel like a complete dumb ass on 'the day'.   I've heard your 25th Birthday is supposed to be special because you are turning a 'quarter of a century old' or some crap like that.  Well yippee fuckin skippee.  I'll make sure to light an extra pretty candle for my own sorry ass.

      I have a few moments of random goodness, which is always a blessed thing to experience when your mood's going potentially in the dumper. 1) My mom bought me a tank top (she got it for a dollar, I think) at some sale and sent it up, but I burried it at the bottom of a dresser drawer due to the colour.  It was white, which is a hue that I am completely allergic to... Anyways, clean laundry was dwindling, and since it was hot, I ripped off the tags and decided to put it on for kicks.  Surprisingly, despite the colour it's one of the most flattering things I've slapped on recently.  Makes me look stacked.  Yippeee! 2) Wandered over to Goodwill with like $1.50 in quarters, not really expecting to buy anything but still it was something to do.  I found a rad goblet that was .69 cents, but half off due to it's green tag today.  *shopping bliss*  It makes a very nice addition to the kitchen. 3) I finally found the two AWOL pacifiers behind Anthony's crib. 4) I got to see the new screen shots for Jak & Daxter Part 3.  JOY! 5) The doll I stuck on ebay is already up in bids to a LOT more than I thought it would go for.  Any step toward financial stability is a good thing! Hey, life don't suck that bad after all...despite knowing I am going to turn 25 in less than 2 weeks and have a sucky ass birthday, as always.

      I dance in my domestic glory...I made the world's best brownies yesterday.  Okay, yes they were out of a box, but I added a little oompf, and now they are the moist, chewy, chocolatey little pieces of heaen that they are. However, my tiara was quickly tarnished when I looked around the house and realized I hate it.  Seriously, I hate my apartment.  Not the shape of it or the size, it's what's in it.  See, years ago in my college days, my living environment was so dang important to me that my entire income went to providing me with the coolest furnishings ever.  My weekends were wiled away painting murals on the walls and coordinating the bathmats with the toilet paper. Growing up and entering LIFE made all that go by the way side, and now my apartment is furnished...not decorated.  In fact, the only room in it that I am happy with is the bathroom.  But hey, $40 at bed Bath and Beyond and that's accomplished. Admittedly, the compromises needed in marriage have led to mismatched furniture.  I awnt to hurl our sectional out the window, but Rick can't bear to part with it.  Oh yeah, and we're broke, so we can't afford new stuff even when we do agree on it.  *sigh* CraigsList, Freecycle, and Goodwill...thank God they exist!  I'm off to eat some brownies and buy some blinders for myself.

      Medium sized, homosexual packages.  I went to the Gobb Shoppe to drop off my sketches for the new tattoo artist, and discovered an old friend working there as their new piercer.  I had met Eric back when I worked at Deja Vu, he was the counter guy at night in the main store.  He was awesome, and totally made the time fly back in the day.  There was always something highly amusing about the peep show girls teasing our little flamer.  He always joked that for the right price, he'd climb in a booth instead of us and "really give 'em a show".  I still wish someone would've anti'd up on that dare.  He made an awesome drag queen, so it would've been hysterical to have our own little crying game with some of the fucks we called customers.   While he was there he was doing piercing on the side, mainly for friends and the gals at the club.  I was originally going to have him pierce my downstairs, but then I got pregnant so put a hold on that idea.  In hindsight I should've hooked up with him after giving birth, as I was unable to have sex anyways and it would've been the perfect time to heal a new piercing.  But, since I wasn't at the Vu, I had no idea how to reach him. Anyways, he's piercing at the Gobb, so he is going to put my nipple rings back in for me.  I had taken them out because I thought I'd be breastfeeding, but that didn't work out.  The holes are still there (the actually leaked milk while I was attempting the ol' BF process, it was pretty weird).  If there's anybody I'd trust to mess with my now less than perfect tatas, it's definitely Eric.  Who better than a raging gay man who's already seen me naked?  Even Rick can be comfortable with that.  Plus, he ain't charging, even if he ends up having to stretch them.  I think I'll be popping a percoset before I go just in case he does.

      Okay, out of curiosity, who the hell reads these things, anyways?  I only know that my hit counter shows people wandering through... I know three of my friends read this, one anonymous net mama, and one nutcase with a vulgar namesake and penchant for odd remarks who shares my enjoyment of Jim Norton comedy.  Oh yeah, and the little retard who felt the need to directly email me a complaint on my choice of writing subject.  If you are still reading twit, you can still kiss my ass.  I had to explain what a blog was to a friend today.  I told her it'd a form of online diary that's publicly posted.  Or your own personal editorial column for a nonexistant and highly self obsessed newspaper that has room for feedback from random readers. I know who's blogs I read, and why (beyond the obvious answer of "i'm bored and my son's asleep"...  Dom's Blog -   urlLink Super villian without a cape    a very close friend of mine who lives too damn far away, so I catch up on his latest ecapades via his blog.  I've dubbed him my own personal superhero. Jessi's Blog -   urlLink DirTmama aka willows_girl   fellow Seattlite mommy who's poptart punky and nice as hell.  Her blog is funny, and she has one of the more interesting jobs I've ever come across. Thea's Blog -   urlLink Thea's Soapbox    Another Seattle alterna-momma who makes the coolest purses EVER.  Go...buy them now... Her writing is amusing, and she's an all around sweet heart. Nico's Bog -  urlLink My Crazy World   keeping up with the theme, she's the third non-soccer mom type mamasita who is actually a nearby resident of Ballard.  She has three kids, and they all completely rock. Jim Norton's Blog -  urlLink "I Stink"   Don't personally know him, but he's a damn funny comedian with a very twisted sense of humour...and a blog he made public.  It's highly read, pretty sick and disturbing in parts, but makes for side hurting sillyness. Alton Brown's blog - -  urlLink Rants & Raves   Not really a blog in the typical sense persay, as it's really just a part of this famous chef's website.  But he writes these very funny rants and raves every so often that are very thought provoking.  So, who the hell is reading this?  Leave a comment, sign the guestbook, whatever.  It's nice to know someone's listening.

      When you are single/without child living in a crowded urban environment, random outside noise does not affect you.  You probably don't even notice it half the time, even if it's a crew of frat boys next door on a three day bender. But when you become a parent, suddenly this shit annoys you very fast.  Mainly because the asshole who yammers loudly on his cell phone on the balcony at 3 AM repeatedly wakes your child, causing you in turn much strife.  I live amongst a cluster of apartment buildings, all three story walkups with balconies facing eachother.  If I walked out onto my balcony right now I could see/hear: The morbidly obese lady in a mumu reading and smoking while she hacks up a lung on the top floor across from me. The guy below her smoking (not hacking his lungs out yet) while he twirls his stringy 'intellectual' goatee. The other top floor balcony with their 'we're so hip' red light in the porch, usually one or two youngish people braying on endlessly and loudly. Bottom balcony where some idiot bitch likes to take her cordless and twirls her bleached hair and blather for hours about stupid ex-sorority sister sounding bullshit.  Very Loudly. The dump-style backyard of my fucked up white trash neighbors, who are actually doing yet another fucking band practice in their non-sound proofed living room.  It's 11:45pm by the way.  I hate those people. In addition to these eye/ear sores, I can hear the person who moved in downstairs being her brandspanking new annoying self.  This little fat girl (who wears belly shirts, ech) likes to play country music at top volume late at night, and work on home improvement projects during the day.  I honestly wish she'd bash her own skull in with that hammer of hers.  Currently, whatever country crooner she's into is turned off, but she's watching a movie and cackling mindlessly every five seconds.  Since she has all her windows open, Anthony has enjoyed waking to her crow a total of three times. There's also someone on our block having a party (it's friggin Tuesday, what the HELL are you celebrating?), someone working on their car, and someone having a 'domestic altercation'. I fucking hate apartments, and I really hate the people who live in them.

      As most in my immediate circle know, I was eagerly anticipating today's dentist appointment.  I got my new front teeth today *insert applause here*.  Last week they took this funky mold of my entire mouth, and some tooth obsessed 'sculpter' sat in a cave somewhere and crafted a retainer like device that contains two teeth where I am missing them.  I gotta wonder how they figure out what those teeth should look like.  It's magic, I tell ya. Anyways, today, they pulled out the contration and deftly shoved it into my mouth (get your thoughts out of the gutters, please).  With a little 'PING!' of the wire in back, they wrestled it around to a "comfortable" fit, and finally allowed me to see the results in a mirror.  It's creepy, honestly, if you didn't know about the little thing, you would not know by looking at me that my smile now contains two imposters.  It's so natural it's...well, not noticable.  Kinda lackluster event really.  She still has to fix my filling on the tooth between the two fakes, but other than that, I've got a complete, unscathed set of teeth in front. It's so fucked when you realize how desperately you want to look normal, that when you do, you feel stupid for having that need, because normal is...well, normal. Anyways, the downfall of my little plastic friend is that I have a heinous lisp right now, until I adjust to talking with it in.  She said it's just like getting used to a toungue bar, so I should have the thillyneth under control in a day or two.  Dad said I sounded a lot better after a few hours of babbling. I asked Rick tonight if I was finally pretty now.  He said I always was (good answer).  I didn't feel like I was, but it's nice to know someone still did.  Which is stupid when you realize how insignificant a tooth can be.  A tooth on me that is less than the size of my pinky nail.  But at least now I can smile and not be embarrassed.  I plan on booking some portraits with Anthony next week.  We'll both be grinning.

      This is in direct response to my newest comment... HI!  There's actually quite the collective of alterna-mommies in the area, and we do get together for hanging out/scaring normal people.  Most of us connected through Mamatropolis and Punky Moms message boards (see links).  There's a local group for both boards on yahoo if you are interested, and there's an upcoming event called Mamafest on Saturday, August 14th at Gasworks park from 12-3.  Basically we're just getting together for a meeting face to face picnicy kinda thing.  Anybody with a kid and an attitude is invited. Most mommy groups are a waste of time for 'different' people, as we usually get shunned rather quickly.  I friggin hate that.  I remember the screwy looks I got when I was pregnant, like "oh my god, they're BREEDING..."  yeah, well, bite my pale and tatooed derierre.  I'll bet us freaks are going to make much better parents than the hyper conservative soccer moms and microsoft dads we see ploughing through bellevue mall every sunday.  Heaven forbid we raise our children to be open minded. Hmmm...that is probably going to turn into a rant, but I have to get going, so I'll save it for another day.

      Men, don't introduce your wives to video games...or they'll end up like me.  I'm currently hopping arund like a puppy on crack waiting for my two favourite game sequels to come out. Jak III, and Ratchet & Clank 3-Up your Arsenal...both come out in the same month, November.  Since I'll be bouncing off the walls when they hit the shelves, poor hubby will probably have to move the PS2 into the bedroom if he wants to continue watching his precious football games.  I consider my fanatic obsession with these to be his penance for the season.  I'll be busy punching buttons and playing like a freak on both games until I have completed them.  Similar to when we borrowed Shawntay's Xbox so I could get my freak on with Morrowind...I don't think I slept the entire 2 weeks we had it in the home.   *sigh* poor Rick, he was so innocent about wanting me to play with him.  I was terrified of the controller...I only played a few random computer games, but nothing so alien as an actual console.  So he tried renting games he thought would peak my interest, but to no avail...then along came Final Fantasy X.  I would sit curled in the chair next to him watching his characters flit across the screen, asking questions about what did what.  Since he was cooking dinner at the same time, he'd frequently pause the game and go stir the pots and pans on the stove.  He'd toss the controller onto my lap each time so the cats wouldn't scamper across it and restart the game.  He was taking a particularly long time in the kitchen, and heard from the living room the telltale song of the game's continuation.  I had begun to play *cue ominous music here*... Since it was a rental, we only had a limited time with it, despite the complex nature of a game like FF.  I'd completely taken over the game and the console within 24 hours, as Rick stared on in shock and awe.  He ended up returning the game a day early, which I swear to this day was in retaliation for me taking over.  So, I promptly threw a fit, walked out the door, and bought a brand new copy of it and the guide book. So, three and a half years later, I'm now an avid 'gamer'.  I don't just play anything that comes out, much to Rick's despair.  I hate the sports sim games he plays.  Not fond of 1st person shooters, either.  My favourites to date: Whiplash - smash the bunny, smash the BUNNY! Ratchet & Clank (1 & 2) - I want a sarcastic robot with a helipack...can I have one? Jak & Daxter (1 & 2) - 1 was okay, 2 rocked.  Still don't know what the hell Daxter IS though... Pacman World 2 - yeah, I'm lame, who cares. Final Fantasy X (& X part 2) - okay, so the whole Charlie's Angels thing was stupid, it was a neato storyline, though. Beyond Good & Evil - Easy as pie, but fun. Despite having a Nightmare Before Christmas level, I thought Kingdom Hearts was rather lame.  Well, that's what you get for it being made by Disney...

      Well, I've scrapped the idea of putting baby names on the leaves on my back, just didn't like the way it would look.  Besides, that whole piece, including the vines, is a seperate meaning....SO! I came up with a new plan...will post sketches when I get off my ass and get them finished.  It's going to be the outline of a roman cross filled with the leaves (think looking through a cross shaped window at the vines) with a banner wrapped around and Anthony's name in it.  We're doing the lettering in the same style as Nightmare Before Christmas, because I am that much of a dork.  I just figured it'd be more legible, and I hate that script-y shit everyone else has on their tattoos.  We'll try and fill the background of the banner with white ink to give it a bit more depth, but I don't really know how my skin will take it.  Some people just don't really show well with white ink.   I've given up on getting with Ben.  As much as I loved his work, and am very proud of the vines he did, he's just too damn busy!  He's off in different parts of the world every other week, and his schedule comnflicts with when I can grab a babysitter :( Found a decent substitute, though, Kat over at The Gobb Shoppe.  She's nice, very old school, and had an attitude I am very confortable with.  She does very nice grey work.  I didn't like the other artists I spoke to because they all acted like they were the shit and couldn't give a fuck less what they were permanently etching into my body.  Well Fuck You very much, but I ain't down with that.  I was fortunate to have had my work done by one of the best artists in the Northwest, I don't need to get attitude from some nitwit who just finished apprenticing a year ago. I even had one twerp get all nasty about "I don't do name tattoos, because inevitably people don't want them on their bodies after a while"...dude, it's my SON...not exactly a relationship that will be breaking up anytime soon.  Morons...

      I got a weird note from someone who had wandered on to my blog, how I have yet to deduce... He/She/It was questioning why all I have discussed is either about being a Mother or being pissed off, or both simultaneously.  Okay, the title of the damn bog is Mother Hoodlum, that should've given you a head's up on the first part, Genius.  As for the pissed off part, well, I have no excuse, so deal with it.   I'm a 20 something woman living in America under the Bush Administration.  Take any part of my consensus makeup, and for fun see how Dickweed in charge has fucked us over, I can be as pissy and outraged as I damn well wanna be!  If you are a woman, or lower-middle class, or young, or well just about ANYTHING you can pretty much bet that Clueless George has completely screwed you in some way.  Oh yeah, and my godamn car tabs are going to cost well over $200 because of that fucking monorail that we're still voting on.  Fucking politicians. Okay, so yeah, I write about being a mother, and I write a lot of rants.  Would you rahter read a single person without a child writing "Oh happy day life is full of flowers and puppies" every day?  Then do a search for LSD using Eunichs and quite writing stupid letters to people you don't know.

      Went to the park yesterday with my new friend Nico and her brood.  I swear, her kids are the coolest.  Ages 5, 7, and 8, all cuter than a damn Rockwell painting.  I'm thoroughly taken witht the girls, especially (nothing against Max, but I have girl envy).  Anyhoo, we're at the park, and Anthony was completely confused by the whole wading pool concept.  I'm taking the camera next time we go.  Dang that place was packed, mommas everywhere... Her kids were playing in the playset area, seemingly having a good time.  The little one came up a few times complaining of a boy with a stick poking/hitting her, and for the life of me, I could not see which one she was talking about.  So Nico and I are now watching the kids like friggin vultures.  Suddenly, all three of her children come tearing out of the play-area at warp speed screaming bloody murder, and we see the litle terrorist.  This pudgy little brat of probably 5-6 years age is flailing a huge stick after them, like a sword, with this insane look in his eyes (I'm not exaggerating, this kid looked seriously evil).  Before we could intercept, the stick tags Morgan, Nico's eldest...HARD.  Nico shows her super mom powers by calming all three kids in like 3 seconds.  All the collected moms there suddenly perk up like prairy dogs, with chants of "Where's that kid's mother? Who's the mother?" As demon seed is wandering around looking for his next victim. This fat white trash bitch waddles up with her cigarette dangling out of the hand with her 'diet soda', apparently to claim Son of Satan.  She just looks at him and says "what're you doing?" like his answer could possibly be "oh, helping with Green Peace efforts, mother dear"...He didn't really answer, just mumbled something like 'getting them away from me' and continue swinging his Excalibur. So what does Mother of the Year do?  Wander off!  You could hear every jaw in that park hit the ground as her fat ass landed on her picnic blanket FAR away from Little Lucifer (in other words, she had no intention of actually watching her demon seed). I swear to GOD if that little future convict had hit Anthony, I would've gone so punk rock on her ass they'd be pulling cellulite off the trees a week later.  Morgan, the victim, was such a champ though, so we let it drop and just left. Grrrr.....people suck!!!!

      Well, my little brother Saturday, after a four day visit.  He's all of 15 now, a lot taller than me.  Hard to call him little now.  Hard to help him either.   He's taking the wrong path, and there's nothing I can really do about it now.  I've tried, but he defies reality.  His lying has almost become compulsory, which is frustrating for his parents, not just myself and Rick.  You can never get the real story out of him.  After realizing how much he's mislead you, it makes you seriously want to beat your head against a wall.  And his.  But mom is so damn lax with him, he gets away with so much.  And she wonders what happened?!  I would NEVER have gotten away with half the shit he does, hence I turned out okay, with a clear understanding of right and wrong, and respect for myself and the world around me.  Adam's got this scary feeling of 'entitlement' that is just appalling.  But if I ever say "hey mom, don't be so loose with him, you weren't with me" suddenly the guilt trips begin and I have to deal with her crying "oh, I was such a HORRIBLE PARENT to you....boohoo, you hate me, gahhhhhhhhhh".  *I return to thumping head against the wall* Some people refer to Adam as the Sharona Mini-me.  Whatever, so yeah,  he wears black clothes, listens to industrial music, reads Kafka, and became a vegetarian at a young age.  That would be where the similarity ends.  I was reading Kafka when I was 8, if that enlightens you at all as to how warped this little girl be.  I was also borderline obsessive when it came to schooling (who graduated at 15? yuppers, lil' miss doogie howser, with nothing to show for it now).  I don't even think Adam wants to go to college.  He has grandious plans of going to live in Either Amsterdam or The Czech Republic.  To do what, I have no clue, because work ethic is an alien concept to him.  His school work is suffering, and he's wandering the lovely path of drug use.  I've tried my schpiel, but I guess someone who's never done drugs just can't seem very convincing.  And then he lied about it to my face, so I guess it doesn't matter much anyways. But I can't hate the little shit.  He lies, he disrespects the parents, he gets all lazy, but then I see him shine for breif moments and like a goddamn halmark card I have hope again.  He's wonderful with my son.  I can leave him with Anthony for a few hours (Wed I had a dentist appointment, Adam babysat), and have no worries.  And in return, monkey squeals and giggles everytime he sees Adam.  So he ate a path through our refridgerator, I say fuggit.  At fifteen there is no need for a boy to worry about his weight.  He has broad shoulders, and is average build.  Anyone says he is chubby I'll put a foot in their ass.  I got really upset with Rick while Adam was up, and had to leave the room so kiddo wouldn't see me fight tears.  He came into the room and just gave me a hug and told me he wanted to take me to go rent some movies.  He spent the last 8 bucks he had of spending money renting hollywood videos to cheer up his big sister.

      I post on several mother oriented message boards, and have been doing quite the battle AGAIN with a militant breastfeeding advocate.  I hate these people.  They keep on harping how horrible formula is, and how you are abusing your child/being neglectful to give them such 'malnutrition'.  I'd like to give them a carefully placed foot up the ass.  One of them actually started saying that formula kills infants!  What a crock of SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIT.   Her latest steaming pile of festering excrement involved a post called Happy breastfeeding and nurse-out Day.  And then she proceeded her usual cramming useless doctrine and rhetoric down everyones throats.  So, I have my own response...  HAPPY 'MY CHILD SURVIVED FORMULA DAY  Gals, if you formula fed your child, and the kid has managed to somehow escape the harrowing death they were doomed to by this abuse, feel free to read and celebrate. If you breastfed, but have managed to keep your dinner down upon seeing someone else give their child a bottle, I suppose you can feel free from attack here too. As a first time parent, especially just out of the gate, we are often times filled to the brim with self-doubts. But, it doesn't mean we're going to stubbornly march in with ignorance and blindly just do 'whatever'. If so, new and soon to be parents wouldn't be so easy to spot in a book store, obsessively pouring over 'What to Expect' tomes and 'Your Baby's First Years' like they were writing a new masters thesis. As there are so many other issues facing our children in this day and age, we need to be focusing on giving terrified newbies positive affirmation and gentle education. We need to present ALL options available, and not screech anything as the ONLY way. We should encourage bonding and nurturing, above all else.  So, I'll stand up in my 'confession'. Hello, my name is Sharona Spangler, and I formula fed my child. For this terrible indescretion, I got an extremely active, beautiful, strong as an ox child who has only been sick once in his entire 14 months. He's a happy little smiler, extremely confident and outgoing, and gets lots of kisses, cuddles, and love. He likes to give mommy and daddy hugs. I was formula fed myself, as was my husband. I'm happy to report we're both still alive and well.

      Anthony has impressed all with his new ability to walk, which he followed with the ability to climb (more irksome than impressive).  Still, being quite short, the second new found gift didn't have us too worried.  How foolish we mortals be... Anthony wakes us every morning by going to the side of the crib that the monitor is on and saying "HI, hi hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii hi" over and over agian til someone wanders in and scoops him up.  It's quite cute.  However, yesterday, he decided to change his MO, honestly I think to make sure we could both have simultaneous heartattacks.  We heard one "HI" on the monitor, followed by a loud THUD.  This thud was followed by screaming, as we flew out of bed and into his bedroom.  There was Anthony, next to his crib on the floor, looking quite shocked and scared at a trick he apparently didn't know he could do, or the ramifications.   He's got a small bruise on his forhead, but mainly a bruised ego.  Scared the PISS out of us, though.  Enter childproofing frenzy by mommy.  Since he's sleep's so erratic, I don't trust him in a real bed yet, I put a 'landing pad' on the side of his crib (it's against the wall on the other side), made of a large fluffy comforter, and re-kid-proofed his room.  Rick is adamant about not moving the shelf with his collectables that's in there (grrrrr), which is just ASKING for trouble.  Well, I suppose he'll learn when Anthony gets out of his crib and uses his Peyton Manning figures as chew toys.  I'm worried about the bookshelf though.  We don't have it secured to the wall, and Anthony could pull it over.  I'm going to have to put my foot down on that one.
