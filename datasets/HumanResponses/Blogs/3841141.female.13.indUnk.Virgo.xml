      Hoshi wandered about the old mansion searching for her beloved Ukchan. Every footsteps she took picked up tons of dust swirling around her. Coughing she stumbled forward leaning on a wall till the dust cleared. After the dust was settled, Hoshi looked around and spied on a stairs she never noticed before. The girl sensed a strange delight creeping up on her as she made her way up the stars. Something was going to happen, she could tell. At the top of the stairs was a small trap door. Hoshi pushed it open and stepped into the crisp night air. A movement caught her eye as she emerged. Ukchan turned in the full moonlight to see who was there. His body had a crystalline glow around it in the moon as her turned and his short blue hair turned to diamond in Hoshi's eyes. As he spotted her. The deep brown eye of Ukchan drilled right into Hoshi's soul as he stood searching her. The females min and heart told her to run to him, but her body didn't listen. All was still. suddenly Hoshi came into herself and dashed forward, her legs becoming weaker and tears streaming from her eyes. She drew nearer and near when her legs gave out. Hoshi started to fall, fall right into Ukchan's strong arms. Her heart skipped not one, not two, but three beats as Ukchan stopped the fall. She didn't dare move for a moment feeling she might wake from a dream if she did. Ukchan gently wrapped his arms around her and pulled her tight to him. Hoshi help her breath as she buried her face in her soft shirt and linked arms around him. She relaxed when Ukchan;s torso softened and leaned on his chest. Hoshi was in a dream like daze as her worries fell away. Squirming a little in the arms that help her firm yet gentle she looked up and caught Ukchan looking down at her with a small curved smile. She lovingly smiled back at him with teary eyes. Taking then a chance Ukchan leaned down, closing his eyes and met lips with Hoshi in a kiss so heavenly and pure that the world instantly feel away from them. Their bodies grew hot as they shared their warmth and seemed to melt into one another, Hoshi closed her eyes and started to kiss Ukchan back putting slender arms around his neck. Both felt as if they could stay like that forever, but Ukchan pulled back after some seconds. Hoshi opened her eyes and looked at Ukchan with the slighest blush streaking her face. Nothing in the world could have beaten that first kiss.

      ((I wonder how far this will go... and uhh... sorry about the spelling.. they took Spell cheak off >  You start to fly hard, fly faster. Every fiber of your being is set on getting more of that precious life-giving substance. You could still taste the salty sweatness in your mouth and you savor it for as long as possible. The lust consums you in it's dark abyss. Soaring over the fiery forest of death you smell the blood of an innocent. The blood of a child mingled with fear, yet some bravery. The young one was drawing closer to you and you lose all control you may have had over your body. You swifty and silently float down to the forest floor and hid in a rose bush as red as the blood you lust for so infinitely. The child makes it's way into a clearing making it's self vulnerable to even the slightest of dangers. You studdy the child with your darking eyes and find little threat other then it carries a small dagger by it's side. The child stumbles a little to close to your hidding place and you get a good smell of it's blood and great fear. The lust takes a new killing hold on you and you leap out at it in a rush of rose pettles floating harmlessly around you. For a splite second the world is frozen in it's own evil as the darkness consums the child. It screams so earsplitting the next moment before you slash at it's windpipe killing it instantly. Blood poors out of it staining the ground red as you start to bite deeply into the wound, lapping up all the newly killed life withen. With bloodlust becomeing even more over powering you turn animal like in your feeding and gorge yourself so deeply that no other feelings can get though.

      ((I hope you don't mind, I continued the story.. add on as well! We could collaborate on it, that would be cool ^^)) Currents of warm air swell and gather underneath your ebony-furred wings, pushing you up, up, higher and higher in a spiraling motion until you think you shall faint from the height. Meaningless patterns of light dance on the inside of your eyes, a fireworks show only for you. You cough. Again and again you try to purge your throat of the sticky-sweet smoke, but it clings to your windpipe like molasses. Your mind starts to becoming weak, driven by the need for clean air it throws its last reserve of energy to your new wings, flapping madly to send you shooting out of the foul, odorous cloud. You break through. There it is- clean air! It seems like a miracle to you as you gleefully inhale the crisp, cold evening atmosphere. But something's not right.. your tongue runs along the top of your mouth before passing along your two canine teeth.. a salty substance trickles from the cut caused by the needle-like point of your tooth. And as the blood flows over your tongue your mind is sent into a frenzy. That was it.. you needed it! Blood! You craved it, you lusted for it, HAD to have it. It was your source of energy.. this newfound realization terrified the corner of your brain still conscious. But soon your mind is captivated by the lusting presence inside of you. Forgetting the forest, forgetting the flames, the corpses, the curse, you beat the air. Wind streams past your face as you cut through the air toward where your instincts told you blood was. Where humans were.. where there would be people to provide you with your means to live.. that is what you longed for. For now, you were not human but a creature of shadow, a vampire..

           Far in the dark night. When all hope is lost. The screech of an owl, the howl of a wolf. You shake as you steep deeper into the forest. The air starts to get colder and yet somehow, more evilly delicious. You come to an ancient clearing showered with sliver from the full moon staring down at it, at you. Your skin prickles and you turn around. Bloody rotting corpses are hanging from each tree. Each body hung from organs strangled around their neck. They seem to be staring right at you. You run! Fast. But nothing could take the curse on you. Nothing will change you back. You start to go though a transformation. Your ears become long and pointed. Your K9 teeth become sharper and longer. As your nails grow great black wings burst the skin on your back.  Screaming in pain you keep running, right into a corpses hanging from a tree. It seems to put it's dead cold arms around you and not let go. Nothing could help you, nothing would save you. You shut your eyes trying to believe nothing is happening, the world is fine, but as soon as your eyes even slightly open you are still being held onto by the corpses. Turning back to the trees trying to break the grip your eyes grow even wider with fear. The whole forest is burning. The sky is alight with dancing flame. The corpses disappears as you try to run the other way only to find that you are blocked in. Trees fall ablaze to the ground starting the grass on fire. You can't get out. You will die and forever this evilly holy land will be your ashes grave. In your vain attempt to escape you leap into the heating air and your wings take flight. Higher and higher into the smoky air that's clogging your lungs.

      How many times can you die in a day?  Why can't you see death comeing from a mile away? Why can't you taste life and all it's britter-sweet? If you die are you still awere of whats going on? or just in a neverending dream? Would you be a newly born baby?  How many years does it take to live again?

      What is life? What is light, time, death? Can you go anywhere after you reach the end?   In the twilight you look up and see yourself looking down at you. You start falling upwards.   Is it real, or not? Is anything you see trustworthy? Or is it all a lie?   You look down and see yourself flying upwards in the sky.  But how can that be? If you are falling upwards and look down would you see yourself flying? Are you dreaming the true dream of life, or are you dreaming a lie? Is the whole truth of your existenice that complicated, or just that simple. What makes us all what we are? Is it our mind? Body? Looks? Feelings? Mayhap just the four componits of life itself. But if it is, what gave us the truth? The ability of thought or a one way mind?   "Is all that we see or seem, but a dream within a dream?"   Ask yourself what really will happen, when all life stops. Will you ceace to existist or will we live on in a continuing dream?   You grab onto a tree and find that the thing you grabed was your arm.   What could really make life so confusing and dream like? Are you really there?

         Part of the problem, Nekomori thought as she tore hurriedly down the street to school, is that I can’t tear myself away from the computer. 	She had been running now for over ten minutes trying to make class on time. Even with her swift catlike running, it still took her forever to get to school. Gah! Why can’t school start later?! Like at 10, not 8:30 in the morning! Nekomori started to lose wind as she went, but couldn’t stop. Schools not that far, I can make it! Her whole body was lost in the determination to get to school on time, she lost all control. Nekomori spotted a rather large crack in the road ahead of her. She tried to stop, but couldn’t and tripped on it. Her paws shot straight out in front of her as she fell on the gravel, but bits of rock bit into her skin like small razors. The cat demon bit her lip as to keep from crying out. Oh no! Of all the mornings! Getting up she wiped the bloody palms on her jeans and continued running down the street dripping a small trail of blood as she went. BRIIIING!!! The first bell sounded at Ryu Kobushi* Middle School. Oh! Good I’m not late yet. Nekomori stood at the entrance of the school when the bell rang. After a small break she started walking to her next class, science, panting the whole way there.  *			*			*  BRIIIING!!! 10:05, one hour 35 minutes later the bell sounded for ten minute break. Nekomori dragged herself from Ms. Hisuteri’s science class with a pound more homework weighing her down. Neko hadn’t really been paying attention to the class. Her mind was more focused on her secret and how, she could tell, it was getting nearer to the time when all would be reveled. She sluggishly walked to her group’s meeting place for the break still thinking of her secret.  Neko’s large eyes picked up the figures of two of her friends standing by the meeting grounds.  The taller one was Nikkota Megami the dragon (human + dragon) that she met last year. The two were brought together by [sheep] Neko’s best friend. Nikkota and [sheep] had sat together one day in their class and they became fast friends. Being a dragon in human form Nikkota had wings sprouting from her back and a long lizard like tail, which set her a part from the already strange group. The person that Nikkota was standing with was Artemis the elf. Artemis was one of Nekos good friends, but it wasn’t always like that. Artemis was a bit mean the year they met and tried to split up [Sheep] and Neko’s friendship with no success. The past year had made up for her actions and now they were all good friends. “Hay!” Artemis yelled as Nekomori drew near, “didn’t see ya this morning. Where were you?” “I was almost late. Slept in, ya know?” “Ah, no wonder.” “Shuji-Baka!” Nikkota walked quickly up to the group of growing strangeness, “I knew you were Shuji!” Neko’s face changed dramatically from a state of joy to obviously false fright. “But! But! It was just a joke. Don’t hurt me.” Neko cowered. Everyone instinctively cracked up at the fake drama Neko was giving off on the subject of Shuji. Shuji was a character on the site C.C. that Nekomori was on all night with. Neko made Shuji’s whole mission; he had been made for a joke on Neko’s friend, Nikkota. For the longest time she had been blaming, unknowingly, Neko for being him. Now she knew for sure after Neko had told her the night before. “Seriously! Shuji is such a Baka*”, Nikkota continued to drill it into Neko. “I know! That’s what he was made for.” [Sheep] then miserably walked up to the group. She had the look of the boredom of death on her face. Nikkota cheeringly went up to her, “What’s wrong [Sheep]als?” [Sheep] sighed and looked down, barely mumbling, “we have P.E. next.” Low annoyed groans exploded from the throat of the group. No one really enjoyed P.E. they just went because they were made to by the evil school district. A district that seemed to enjoy seeing the students miserably sweat in the heart of midday. One that basked in the glory of seeing helpless children faint one by one on a field of dead grass, while the teachers sit in the shade making sure they did it. P.E. was the school student’s number one fear. BRIIIING!!! The bell signaled the end of the break and the start of the passing period. The four friends looked at each other and swallowed. Each knew what they were doing today, Cross Country. Cross Country was running, a lot of running. Everyone was made to run almost two miles in the scorching heat of [place]. If they got a time of 20 minutes or more then they would get a failing grade. Side by side, the company made it’s way slowly to the locker room chattering worriedly about the horrible events ahead. After setting down their backpacks in the Backpack room and proceeding next to the lockers, Lily joined them. “Can you believe the school? Really?! Making us run on a day like today?! It must be at least 100 degrees out there and they expect us to run?! I mean, Come on! Are they trying to kill us?” “They are. Everyone knows it. We should go on strike,” [Sheep] joined in with Lily. “Yea! That’s a good idea! They can’t keep doing this to us!” Artemis said, getting more and more into the idea. “I mean, what’s the point of Cross? There is none, so the only explanation is that in fact, they are trying to kill us. And legally too!” continued Lily. “We need to make shirts that say ‘Down With Cross’ or something and wear them under our P.E. shirts. Then when they tell us to run we take off the P.E. shirt and sit there wearing the anti-cross shirts!” Neko started to get the glorious image in her head.  “Yea! If we get enough people to help us then they have ta get rid of Cross. They can’t really expel or suspend so many kids at once!” “We need to collect money somehow, [Sheep]? Do you know where your cousin makes his ‘It was hot today’ shirts?” “No, but I can ask him to order them for us. What size?” “Medium should work.” “Alright.” “I can collect the money for safe keeping,” [Amanda] the [race] came up to the group after hearing most of what was said, “I can help.” “Good, good. Now we need someone to make signs,” Lily seemed about to explode with excitement. “Why not wait until we get the shirts and stuff,” [Sheep] suggested. “Yea, then we’ll know how many we need” Nikkota put in. Neko looked around the looker room, “maybe we should be going. We are, like, the last ones in here.” The party started to move slowly out of the room, still talking about their plans of striking Cross. Neko galloped ahead of the group in her normal outside hyper ness. She started leaping and doing spins in the air, almost like a strange ballet dance. As Nekomori stopped for a moment she saw everyone not in her group running frantically for their assigned spots on the ground. She skipped back over to her group, grabbed Artemis’s sleeve and started pulling her over to their class. When arrived at the class, Artemis ran for her seat, as did Neko. Their teacher, Mr. Hogakukiro, came out of the boy’s locker room, walking darkly over to his class. The students watched aware of his attentions, he was planning something, but what? “Well class!” he growled as he reached the head of the class, “today is Frisbee and Cross. You! Come up here and lead the class in stretching.” A small fairy got up and started doing stretches that the rest of the class followed. Grr… Frisbee… why?! No one cares if we can toss a Frisbee or not, it’s just… why? Neko was getting tired of the pointlessness of P.E. and how they were made to do things. The stress of all her other classes, she thought, were enough, but the school didn’t think so. “Alright!” the teacher reappeared after the stretches were complete, “I want everyone to run around the tennis courts and adventure zone to the field! And GO!” Everyone started running or walking the set course, but slower then normal because of the heat. Neko hung back with the two friends in the class, Artemis and Mishiranu. Mishiranu was a strange alien cat girl that had come from a mysterious planet many light-years away. Her over large brown eye and ankle-length brown hair made her appear to be a normal cat demon at first glance, but if you looked closer you would find she was not. She looked almost anorexic with only 56 pounds. She also had little strips of black all over her whole body with tiny hairs she could make grow or shorten at will. Mishiranu had often spoken of her home planet. It’s icy cold weather and fruit that could only grow there. You could tell in her voice she missed her home very much. The friends talked about Mishy’s home all the way around the course to the Frisbee place. As normal they were late and the teacher had already started talking. Neko zoned out and got lost in her own little world as the teacher continued to bore her.  Mr. Hogakukiro released the Frisbee teams to go play a game no one understood. Neko’s friends had to split up for the time being because they were all on a different team. Neko’s team, she then realized, was placed against Mishy’s. Neither of the friends was up to playing in the heat so they just walked around talking about planets. “Wanna go get a drink” Mishy seamed about to faint after a while “Alright.” The two started slowly walking up the ramp to the crappy water fountain. After they both had their fill of the contaminated tasting water they started to head back when Mishiranu stopped. She turned to the ramp bar that kept people from falling off on the other side. Mishy carefully went up to it and slid herself under it to the other side. The dirt on the other side sloped down to where they were supposed to be playing Frisbee. Trees and bushes that hid anyone there also surrounded the dirt. Mishy started walking up the ramp on that side, holding on to the bar to keep from sliding down with a small grin on her face. Neko ran up to her, “what are you doing?!” “I’m walking to the end of the field, come with me.” “No! What if you’re caught?” “I don’t care. This school is run by idiots anyways.” “I’ll walk by you on this side of the bar.” “Ok” As the two started walking, Neko’s keen ears picked up the whistle that told everyone to stop. “Um… Mishy… I’m going to go now,” Neko shot down the ramp and joined the others before she was missed. The small class started to make it’s way up the ramp to the start of Cross Country. “Where is Mishy?” Artemis asked finding Neko in the crowd. “Unless she was caught, she is somewhere over there,” the cat demon pointed a long finger towards the corner Mishiranu had climbed. “Oh…” Artemis looked worriedly down where Mishy went then back to Neko, “You gunna run today?” “I never do, especially in this heat!” “Can I walk with you then?” “Alright. By the way, have you seen [Sheep] or Nikkota?” “I think this is their class now.” The two other 7th grade P.E. classes made their way up the ramp and combined with Mr. Hogakukiro’s as they reached the top. [Sheep] and Nikkota were talking excitedly about something as Neko and Artimis joined them.  “I wish I was aloud to fly Cross… but if I did I would be suspended. Stupid school. What’s the use of wings if I can’t even use them?!” Nikkota said angrily, cursing the school. Artemis shook her head, “God, seriously! Just how dumb is this school? People with wings should be able to exercise them more then legs.” “And werewolves should be able to use their wolf form!” [Sheep] snarled in the direction of the teachers. “Well… blah to them! They are just idiots anyway, they can’t help what they do.” Neko growled softly, “It’s not their fault they are bakas.” “I know, but still!” “Class! Class,” Ms. [teacher] stood in front of the mass, “Everyone behind the cement line! Ready? Go!” The kids took off in their normal sudden adrenalin. The group soon fell back to be the last people in Cross, but didn’t care and chatted both happily and angrily.  “We so need to get together when we are older and make our own school. One where there is no evil teacher to push it’s students around. There are nice teachers that give no homework and actually teach kids something!” [Sheep] blabbered on intently, “and one that has swings!” “Yea! Swings are cool! This school needs swings!” Nikkota put in.  Artemis thought about this for a second, “why doesn’t this school have swings in the first place?” “Because this school sucks. It thinks that swings are to babyish for middle schoolers.” “But they’re not! Swings rule! We need to like… write to the school or something.” “Doubtful they would heed it. The school is an idiot remember?” “God, of only I could turn into a bigger dragon, then the school would be gone,” Nikkota puffed out a little dragon smoke left over from her last fire breathing. “Oh! That would be so nice.” “Then instead of being made to go to differed school, we could run away from the polluted air of this place… Live in a cave in the forest or something. It would be nice…” Neko mumbled to on one in particular, but just looked up into the sky. “It could be like a pack! We could get the others to come too!” [Sheep] started daydreaming. “If only…” The party kept talked and daydreaming about possible events they would do in the future to both their lives and the school. It all seemed so clear that they were going to be friends no matter what. Minute by minute the group walked slowly the Cross course which seemed to take forever. As the time passed the girls got more and more excited about the dream plans each of them knew most were not going to come true.  The assembly was soon almost half way done with the first lap out of two laps. They were nearing the place where Mishiranu had disappeared. “That is were Mishy ran off to before Cross, I hope she didn’t get caught,” Neko worried as they went. “I’m sure -” a teacher yelling at them from across the field cut off Artemis. “Run! You can’t walk and talk. If you walk you need to be 20 feet away from each other!” the teacher was getting more and more upset. The friends instantly took off at a rate. They started to spread out because of different running speed, soon almost in a strait line. Nikkota, [Sheep], Nekomori, and then Artemis all panting trying to stay out of direct trouble. The teacher’s beady red eyes followed each movement looking for a fault. As the group lost wind they slowly automatically drew together. The teacher grew inpatient and started to stalk over to the worn group. “What are you doing?! I told you to work out! Or at least be 20 feet away from each other, but you seem to have lost that privilege. We want you to work out at this school so you can become stronger. Not work on your social skills! This is P.E. physical education and we call what you are doing ‘defiance.’ If you don’t listen and obey then I will have you out of here in a second with a referral! Why? Because I can! Now, RUN!” Neko sighed a looked slant ways down. I couldn’t care less what grade I get in P.E.! The teacher turned her three eyes to Neko, “you three run! You stay here.” The others ran off in fear of getting suspended while Neko faced the evil triclops teacher. “As I have said, what you are doing is called ‘defiance’ which gives me the right to suspend you even on the smallest mistake. So unless you want some big problem then run and don’t sigh in front of a teacher! Now, GO!” Neko eeped and ran so hard she almost fainted. Blinded by tears she tripped over something lumpy in the path. She wiped the tears away and looked down. There was the body of the fairy in her class. Just lying there, pail and cold. Neko put her hand to his wrist to find a pulse. “What are you doing?! Leave him! He is passed out so I will deal with him later, now RUN!” Nekomori got up and worked her way up to a run. Her eyes soon blinded by pain, heat, and tears. Her legs felt like jelly, but she still pushed on. She couldn’t take it much longer. Neko felt herself slipping into a faint. There was nothing she could do. All went dark. “The time is coming, be prepared” A small voice pierced the darkness. “Who are you? Where am I?” “The time is coming.” “What time? What will happen?” “Be prepared.” “Be prepared for what? Who are you?” The voice faded back into the darkness “Hello? Hello?!” “Neko?” “I am here” “Nekomori Chan!” “What?” “Wake up!” Neko jerked awake startled. Her friends were gathered around her as she lay on the black top.  “What? What happened? Where am I?” “You passed out for a second. Don’t run so hard next time,” Nikkota looked worriedly down, “you fell on my tail, are you alright?” “I’m fine, but wont we get in trouble being in a group again?” “Don’t worry. That teacher had to go do something. we wont get in any trouble,” artemis looked back just to make sure. “Are you sure your alright? Your as white as paper.” “Don’t worry about me. Now come on. We need to keep moving.” [Sheep] helped Neko up and the group continued to migrate. “Why did that triclops keep you back anyways?” [sheep] asked unknowingly. “Because I sighed! What kind of teacher would really stop anyone for that?! Really? She also threatened me with suspension!” “Oh dear God you should be able to sigh if you want to! This school is crazy or something for doing that.” The conversation continued with the walking completing it’s first lap. Again, as it neared the half way point, Keno ponted out the place Mishy vanished. “Do you think she is still there?” Neko asked the group. “Most likely came the reply from Artemis, “We’;; find out when we get up there.” The company advansed and whennear enough Neko called oout, “Mishiranu?” “What?” came the reply from a tree. “What are you doing?” “”Skipping Cross with [Ashely].” “I see. Well you can come out. It’s nearly over.” Mishy and [Ashely] emerged from the tree looking really bored. “Have fun?” Nikkota asked the two. “Yea, we sat and talked.” “Can I ship with you next time?” [Sheep] eagerly asked. “and me!” “and me!” Everyone wanted to get out of the horror. “Sure. I think I will bring some soda and stuff next time. Maybe a T.V. some popcorn?” “That would be sweet,” Nikkota jumped in, “I can bring something!” “That would be great.” Neko thought about the idea, “How would you get power for all this?” “I’ll hook up a power line.” “to a tree?!” “Yup.” “Ummmm… ok…”

       Everyone put in their ideas and soon they past the end of Cross and started the walk back. "Is he coming over here?" Neko asked paranoid as Mr. Hogakukiro spotted everyone coming. He looked so evil that anyone would think the cyclops was up to no good. With arms as his side and head bowed so slightly Neko could feel his eyes on them. "He is walking evilly. Look at his eyes. It's like, right out of a movie or something." "Yeah, creepy. What's with the walk?, it's like an 'I'm going to get you" type thing," [Sheep] shuddered. "Ug... what's he planing now?" "I dunno, but I know I've had enough of these teachers." "Shh! We are getting nearer. He might hear you." The teacher stopped as the girls walked over. Neko, [Sheep], Artemis, and Neikkota held their breath as they past. Mr. Hogakukiro had stopped Mishy and [Ashley], but the only words the main group heard as each one disappeared into the locker room were, "You made a wrong decision." "I hope they aren't in to much trouble," uttered Neko as they started dressing rapidly, "they didn't do anything wrong if you think about it." I know, but the teachers here don't think," Mutter [Sheep] "Yeah, but still..." As the girls talked about this Mishiranu came back with [Ashley] steaming by her side. "What happened?" [Sheep] and Neko asked in unison. "The teacher blabbered on and I didn't listen, and [Ashley] got a referral." "Didn't you get one?" "No... I dunno why." everyone continued to dress and talk about how stupid the teachers were until the bells blasted them out with it loud ring. "Off to lunch!" Nikkota and [Sheep] started to walk off to get some food after saying bye to the group. Neko split up to go to her [RAM] class to read as did everyone else. The teacher was late, as normal. Ms. [Faust] briskly walked up to the classroom with her whole class waiting impatiently for her to unlock the door. As soon as the room was opened the mass crowed into the smelly, cold room and found their seats. Immediately the place was full of talking, yelling, and playing. "Class! Class! Settle down, sit down, and start reading," The teacher hissed, "You know that you are suppose to start reading as soon as you come in. I'll count to tree. One, two, three."

       The moon, so bright and bold, will guide my way though all the old. The times that we share are as sweet as stone and this is why we will never grow old. But what is this old that we speak of so often? Is it simple age? Or something more? Will in the night the moon, never wearing down to the bitter ness of old, someday teach us, tell us all it knows? If there really is such a thing as old, he will know, he will know. OH what is this moon so high? Always running from the lighting sky. Yet still as lovely as been told. It's bold face that glitters down upon us will never shine again if old is real and we are not. What thought the icy air of night will fly so swiftly as a bat? A bat with it's wings unfold as it foretold the darkling of the world, so cold. And if this white night sun will stop shining and leave the universes's living core, what will happen is so untold. So hear me and take my word that no one will survive this earth. You have pushed it to far it wishes to roll, roll far away to a space unknown.

      Ok so this is the dream I had last night. It is really mushy and stuff and the best non-vampire dream I've ever had! ^^ Beware! Fluffy things included!  Oky so... It's like this: It started In school and stuff, right? Yea there was this ride thing in this building. Some of my friends and I went in it and like it was a conveyer belt with trash on it splitting into to was as it went. The trash goes one way and people go other way. But like we were on it and this really big bog of beer type thing went on it and got stuck with broke the ride so my friends and I just walked and sat watching the movie they were playing in there on this great pull down T.V thing. *Movie unknown*. Yea. Then we left and separated. *later* I went back in and sat down bored watching movie. *Beware! This is where fluffy comes in!* This insanely hot boy comes in and sits right by me! I mean WOW! Short black hair kinda anime style and stuff and eyes and tall and OMG! I can't describe his hotness (and in the dream he is also the person that plays Ukchan). I look at him knowing him and like, I have a crush on him. He looks at me and I look at him and stuff. He says to me in his warm voice type thing, "I've always liked you" And I'm all OMG! I love him! And stuff. And like yea. He takes my hand and like yea. He hold hands there and stuff. I lean on his shoulder. And then like yea soon we get up and like walk out holding hands and stuff and I'm all ^^. I start walking in front of him holding both his hands with both mine leaning back on his chest and stuff. And we are just like walking that ways across the quad. There we meet his friends and he talks to them and stuff and I break away from him to go tell my other friends. And like I find friends and things (Bekka and Annie fer some reason) and I tell them and there just like "No fair!-_-; My Ukchan" and I'm all (^-^)v yea. I go back  and another friend runs up to me and are all like "How did you get Mat? (name of boy)" and I'm all like "I was myself" type thing. And then I go back to him and I spend the rest of the dream in his arms. The End!

      Okay, so I finally had a dream!  It started out.. I'm not quite sure. But it ended up in this farmer's market type of thing, where lots of inventors are selling a whole bunch of junk. So, I'm there for a bit, then I go back to this.. camping.. place. Sort of. There's a barn-ish-shed-thing-of-doom where cars are parked and stuffs like that. And so we're all gathered by this freakin' AWESOME anime guy, looks like Crim from .hack//SIGN only wearing leather.. black leather.. mm.. :9 Anyway. And he's like, in front of this hill, and saying that there's a fire coming our way. A few seconds later, fire comes ROARING over the hill. People are all screaming and running for their cars and all, so we (we being my mother and father and I) hop into an old-style white beetle and get to the road. Then I look over and I'm all "O_O OMIGOSH WHERE'S BOY?" And my mom just turns to me all calm-like and says, "Oh, he must have died."  So I start freaking out, and my parents don't even seem to care. I hop outta the car and race back toward the barn-ish-shed-thing-of-doom, which is on fire. And people are just.. standing in it not caring. -_- So I start shouting, "BOY! BOY! PETER! WHERE ARE YOU?" He just walks out (Point of interest: he's got glasses on in my dream, but normally he's got contacts) calmly and gives me 'that look' that shuts me up pretty fast. So we all get back in the white beetle and are driving down the highway when suddenly the 'rents turn off of the road onto a.. golf course.  We're just drivin' down the golf course when suddenly it becomes a cliff. And at the bottom of the cliff we see.. more golf course. Well, we can't stop ourselves now, we go flying off of the edge, then land. Boy and I crash through the windshield and start.. uh..  flying.  Like we were shot out of a cannon, you know? And the land below us becomes so teeeeeny tiny, and we hit the ground and it doesn't hurt at all. Then we get up to find mum'n dad.. then I woke up.  ...I have the oddest dreams.. >_>

      Ok this odd dream has to do with wolvies!!! YAY! Many odd things in here! Funfun!!  So it starts off with me and my brother in my room just sitting when my mother and some random lady person comes in. They sit at a table that is at the foot of my bed in my dream and look at us. We look at them. Mother dear tells us that we re wolves!! And we are all like YAY! ^^ *bouncy bouncy bouncy *! And the lady person is all nice and gives us papers to fill out. Something about mating season. Well like. We don't have time to fill it out and we go to this place. We walk right next door to the old school, but as we are walking it changes to a forest. There we find wolves everywhere! hundreds of wolves! And like, most of them are really thin with their face and body so I change into a beautiful pure black wolf (most of the other wolves were brown) and like I walk down there. Here I look around and see the lovely brown wolf. Not thin like the others and not fat. Just, perfect. I run up to him "Hello? Hi? Heeeelllllooooo?" But before he can answer me some random werewolf in his human form blows a whistle and we all have to line up just like in the old school! Then like, I look for that wolf I was trying to talk to, but I can't find him. After that we went home and got the papers to fill out again. I started to fill it out like my brother, but he finished first (because most of the time he was trying to sit on my paper). When the lady comes back from where ever she was I showed her my paper and she gives me another one after telling my brother to not do that. I try to fill it out again, but for some reason I was not sitting at the table. I soon lay my paper down again just to take a break when my brother comes over and sits on it and tears it. I'm all "grrr" The lady comes in and I show her my paper and shes all "*sigh* I didn't think it would take you THIS long to fill it out." I get the paper and sit at the table and do the second question then look at the first. It says to write your parents and grand parents and great grand parents madden names and I'm all "What the heck? Do we have to do the first one?" and the lady is all "No, you can skip that one." So I do most of the paper before I wake up. OHH! Wasn't that fun? Being a wolf was the best thing I have ever felt. OH! I want a continuation of that dream!!!

      Ok, so last night I had many odd dreams and I will tell you two here. So like yea. This one has pirates and kids in it! On with the dream!!!  It started I was on a huge boat in the middle of an ocean with my mom and like 11 daycare kids. All the daycare kids were like doing this course where they climbed things, crawled on things, and slide down things to nursery music. Then like my mom was wearing a scary red dress. Then after all the daycare kids were done we went down below the deck to uhh.... change into different outfits. Well my mom brought out this patriotic dress and then a really REALLY big american flag. Well I thought it was for twirling like in color guard, but then she took it off the poll and rapped it around my head like a bandana. So I'm like ooook... Then like I went up with five kids and like these pirates started to board our ship. They grabbed the five kids for slaves then wanted more. I tried to fight them but they soon got five more. With these they took out these needles (sowing) and pocked each kid and each one died. One little boy was left. I took him to the front of the boat and told him to stay, but he followed me anyway. I got mad at him but then the pirates took out other needles (doctor) and stabbed him. Then I woke up. Isn't that nice? Well, yeah sure, I mean. The kids are gone now right???

      jinopets.com has some cool looking pets, but not many! It's maps seem a little ill drawn and the games are few, but it also has good chat! Go see!  veropets.com is really odd. It has somewhat of a choice fer pets and you can have 3. The pets seem... odd. They seem mostly to be made from parts of other animals in life. Then the map. Most of the places dont work, but hey, it's a growing site!  furry-paws.com is a very odd sitee. It has nothiing but dogs, lots of dogs. Over 100 to pick from. These are realy life dog breeds. Then, after you find where to get them (It's kind hard to) you can change it's pic. The place has jobs you can chose from and games and stuff. Overall it's on odd oky-ish site.  muchopets.com is really odd. The pets are 3D-ish and moving! That's a new one. There are NO games and the site is confusing. It's a slightly OK site, but I wouldnt tell anyone to join it.
