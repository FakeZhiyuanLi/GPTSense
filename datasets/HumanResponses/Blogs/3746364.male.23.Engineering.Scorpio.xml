      morning i was watching MTV, i inspired to see a movie and amde a plan to see it in hall but when i asked Somebody(i am actually hesitating to call that someone as my friend because now he is not among us. Sorry, god may bless him). he adviced me to see Lakshya with my girlfriend. I don't know why, if movie is romantic , he is right. any way he disapponited me in two ways: one i have no girlfriend, so it was his comments. second he is busy with his ORKUT and someone else who is not here. that's why i am saying he is not among us. he was a good boy but he would be angry if i will right any more.   here i am learning some financial terms and to improve my financial health. i am missing my friends to much who have completed their MBA in finance (now they are financially sound opposite to the proverb that money speaks). while reading financial management i have been surprising that how did they manage finance without having it.  now i am thinking to watch Deewar(may be wall) within the 4 Deewars of the room. Bye

      life is so colourfull i am realiseing this for a long time. now i have some turns in forcoming days. what will i be in next 5 years, where will i be. nowdays i am busy with my past performance in my workplace. everything is meshed and i have to put the thingat their pace  before i leave for a new destination. destination???? i don't know.i can't believe even on me. i am not satisfied with my condition because i did nothing here except garbage things. i want to sit alone in my room and like to have no call from anywhere. i tried to do so but whenever i went to my room to get some relief i got a call. when i go for swimming i try to concentrate on my practice but i failed. some times i crossed the width of the pool in a single breath and some times i coudn't move a step ahead. whenever i try to realise my situations i got nervous. i am very tensed these days due to various reasons. nobody is arround me except my GOD and i feel HIM. i am grateful to him that i am writing this. bye

      July starts and I miss my school days. I remember when I was in my school I used to love to go to school, new books, new bags, new class-teacher, new class room,enjoy masti vah vah. I really miss yaar. Now days we are busy with our jobs and careers and have no time to share those feelings. But thanks to e-mail, mobiles, and obviously blog knid of thing to keep in touch with my golden friends. Here I m again in difficult situation to decide my way for the ultimate goal of my life. At this turning point I have so many advises, few choices to go ahead. Faith in god, trust on my friends, blessings of my Guru and my family, and with all my relatives whoever love me or not, here I m ready to face the challenges.

      today i m feel someing some relax from my work. trying to swim better but have some problem while breathing in water. enjoying IITK, but not interseted to stay here for a long time. i told my friends that now i m in preparing to leave the place soon. not only one reason but so many. my best friends are struggling with their destiny, i can only pray for him and nothing else. after all this is a golden time for them to make themselves strong. i really worry for them knowing that everyone has to face that type of problems in one's life. i love them so i care for them. love never dies only change the way to express. today i have no way to express my love. i m fool i have a graet feelings for them.  once there was a GAP but now there is a gap.
