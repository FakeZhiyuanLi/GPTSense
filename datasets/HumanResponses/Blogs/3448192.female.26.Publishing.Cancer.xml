       Skint Silly   I got suitably drenched this morning because I am broke. We are all broke. 'We' being my better half and I. 'Better' because he fixed me pancakes this morning, which is the reason why I can afford to skip lunch today as I am still full (OK, I lied. I am just broke).  I have $19 to my name, and he has $10 - but he doesn't know that. I’ve secretly placed one of my two $10 notes in his wallet last night. Good thing that we went to get groceries last weekend. That should last us for two weeks. But by then I should be home. Maybe. That also means that Mummy will go back to the Bug Woman Cave, hyeh hyeh hyeh. Hey, it isn’t that bad for them. They will have someone to cook for them all the time. They lead an easy life there as compared to me. All I get is sex on tap, The Family Guy, loads of Dutch cheese (I so like) and our occasional treat - Hello Panda chocolate biscuits. There is one packet left in the fridge, do you think he will know it was me?  So, it is all good except that I am broke. It’s not funny! Pass me $20, Someone. Yeah yeah... OK, fine. Be that way.  Also, all my friends are abandoning us now. Long story. Actually I also cannot be bothered with ‘friends’ like those.

      So this party was better than the one that we had just left. It was the launch of a new magazine, set on the lawn of a charming old five star hotel. And this was no cheapo, low standard ‘do either. Chefs with their tall white hats stood behind their stations surrounding the guests, ready to whip out bacon risotto, crab meat temaki and deep fried golden cheeseballs. The bartenders poured us drinks from behind the ice bar by the water fountain. Our friends and some people that we know from the local theatre scene were there too so conversations were easy. I was chatting with my girlfriend and her partner, while my boyfriend wandered off to talk with other people.  Then Christian walked up to me and asked if I was enjoying the party. I said yes, and we clinked our martini glasses while we both looked around with smiles on our faces.   I have been drinking since I knocked off work, at that previous event. That place was half a minute’s walk away from my office so that had to be done. Five hours later, here I am, and I was getting a little tired and tipsy. I did contemplate about not going to work the next day, and then I decided against it. Oh well, I thought. I shouldn’t be over-indulging myself all the time. I must tell Jelte that we ought to go home.  “So where are you off to next?”, Christian prodded. I am known – and I am not proud about it – for going all out on parties no matter if they are on a weekday or a weekend.   But tonight has been a little bit strange for Jelte and I. Ever since he was ‘late’ in meeting me after work, which had kept other people waiting for me. Six months into being with each other, this evening had been a stage for a string of misunderstandings and miscommunications to happen. Although no one could be blamed for those verbal accidents, I was understandably upset. I can’t be blamed for unblamable mishaps.   “Actually, Christian, I am waiting for my Beacon of Light. We are going home”, I replied. “Where is he now?”. “Er, actually, I don’t knows I said. So we both looked around to locate my six-foot-two man.  And there we saw him, to our left, under a tree, clucking away pretending to be a chicken, as he chicken-walked towards a crowd of people whom I prayed to God were people he knows!  “Yep, that’s Jelte all right,” Christian helpfully informed me.   Bursting out in laughter, I remembered once again what made him so special to me. He is just so innocently clueless sometimes, and he does not care what other people think. And with that thought, I forgave him in my heart for his inability to be on time with me today (did I mention that I did not actually inform him of when to meet?), and I also chucked away all thoughts of pushing him into oncoming traffic on the way home.

      There is a bunch of girls who work in the same industry as I am. We are all in the lifestyle, food and beverage, fun and games business. It is not all glam and handbags. We work hard. If you happen to catch us having fun, it is just us balancing the equation of working hard with equal amounts of partying.   All of us except for one are also dating full-grown men without what that is commonly known as ‘good’ or ‘stable’ jobs.   My partner doesn’t even have a job.   Or rather, he is in between jobs. Take my word for it – he tried, oh lord he did. But this is not about his inability to score an employment worthy of his talents and time.   Most women in eras as recent as 40 years ago can only dream about getting out there, going to school and earning a rightful living as well as a place in society.   They dare not even venture out in skin-tight outfits, go to clubs, meet members of the opposite sex, have drinks and smoke cigarettes.   I know, it can get tiring, bringing up the battle of the sexes issues, the past versus the present again. Especially since this is not the Adam and Eve Revisited.   But I do like to waffle on that the bunch of girls and I, we wear sexy clothes if we want. We go out there and drink like men, we smoke, we pay for our own stuff, we put ourselves in cabs, we go home and go to work again the next morning.  There I’ve said it.   Yes we do all that and more! And I am happy, I am proud and I feel very fortunate to be here, doing my bit and having fun while I am at it.

      He sat me down when I got in and I told him everything. He was rather amused by it all (well, he actually told me 'you amuse me' last night when I managed to burn our dinner potatoes with our daging masak kicap). Then he ran up to the room to get us cigarettes to smoke while we try to flag down a cab outside (we didn't manage to score a freecab) but when I was waiting for him outside the house, I got a cab instantly.   Arrived at work, 10.20am.

      Jelte & I got up together again this morning. This is his second day waking up with me as a result of our Annual General Meeting on Monday night. We were discussing his status here, about him getting a job, about him being pro-active about getting a job, about him being pro-active about getting a job so he can buy me presents. I told him that to look for a job, it is a 9-5 process. He gotta be in the full-time mode because that is the best way to get the fattest worms, just like how they say that the birds do it in the mornings.  Anyway, so uppity-up we went this morning. I had coffee and chocolate toastie (those things that Jelte calls 'the Power Puffs') (they are actually just breakfast snacky things that you pop in the toaster and the ones we had in the morning has chocolate icing on it and marshmallows inside). I took the Today paper in, I read some, and then we said goodbye as I went out, jumped on the bicycle and off I rode into the winds towards the bus stop. It was 9.10am, I needed only be at work before 10.  I wasn't half as unlucky as yesterday morning when I got so drenched in the rain that I was still wet when I got back home. But I wasn't any luckier today (err, did that not make sense?).   We arrived at the stop, me and my bike - no drama nor me tumbling down flat, grassy patches - and so I took my cigarette from behind my ear and lit it to celebrate. Turned around to lock my bike onto the fence and GASP!, no key! Whipped my cell out to SMS Jelte, and GASP! , no reception! My phone's finally been cut off (consider yourselves informed). So as cool as a banana I jumped on it again to go back home. Hell, I only have some money left, but I had no choice but to cab to work as soon as I get this wretched bike back home.   Turning back, an amah and her baby in a pram was blocking my route so instead of waiting patiently for them to pass, I was possessed enough to take a chance and turned into the street before the one that I was supposed to take.   What was I thinking!  I wasn't, obviously.  I spent the next thirty minutes being lost! That bloomin detour took me all over District 6, District 10 and 11 and all others in between! I went to Namly Park, Namly Drive, Duchess this and that, Bin Tong Park... everything but Coronation Rd West. And I can't even call for help. Houses at these places are so neatly tucked away, so secluded, and very disorientating. Many times I have taken a turn and each time I believe with a swelling in my heart that THIS route will take me home, it did not! I went down slopes that took me to people's car porches, I took up slopes that lead to new apartments with construction workers loitering around, maids smiled at me when they see me making u-turns one second after I turned in... it was hot, there was no more cigarettes, I have no phone and no freakin sense of direction.  All because of a bloody baby!  My lucky twist was when I saw a field towards my right so I thought 'have field, have way to tembus'. But again it was someone's large house but this time, there was someone who spoke English and who actually looked like he lives there. I was about to turn away when he called out if he can help. So I told him I was lost. 'Where are you going? Maybe I can help?', he said. He was in his sporty (probably golf) gear and piling stuff into his maroon Merc. I know this sounds dumb but I told him the truth. 'I am actually looking for my way home.' With a smile he helpfully informed me that I could go through that field there, ride down the hill and follow right at some point or other.   So I said thanks (I saw him smiling in a way that a parent will smile when their kid said bye as they board the schoolbus) and went on my way. I actually walked down the hill, too much of a wimp by now to do any superhero acts. And after one more time being lost time, I was home.  I rang our doorbell, an astounded-looking Jelte greeted me at the door, his face full of question marks. All I could muster was,"I decided to go for a ride around the neighbourhood instead of going to work." And I wearily parked the bike and went inside to call a cab.

      It’s pissing down rain right now and I haven’t been this happy, or rather, 'alright' all week.   I had been stressed out and, more importantly I was down in a black depression hole. Just like I do sometimes and this one saw me being given oxygen and pills at Raffles hospital on Tuesday. Jelte and I were in the midst of a movie at Lido when I got the trembles and a racing heart. It was another anxiety attack. Following day, uncontrollable sobs and a cloak of doom enveloped me and I was flat out on the bathroom floor of his for hours. He was with me both times and even then, I thought he would leave me for having seen me that way.  But of course, when your mind starts doing crazy things, you can’t be expected to make much sense. To prove that right, Jelte is still with me. He seems to think that to have seen my worst is one of the best things between us. I love him to death - recently I told him that I love him so much ‘I want to give birth to him'. Heh. I meant, I want him to be one with me, not just another person. At that time, that’s how I felt about him. Now of course I am back to my usual feelings that your partner should always retain his individuality J.   And today is the first day that I don’t feel the need to take an anti-depressant pill! Yippee. Thank God for small mercies. The things I took for granted just a week ago - being 'normal'/ 'balanced' – I got it ‘back’ today and I feel so calm, without drugs.

      I am so fragile this past week. When Ayla, the heroine in the book I am reading, The Clan of the Cave Bear, was cursed with death, I wanted to cry. It’s Vesak Day public holiday on Weds, and I have four days off work from Saturday onwards.   Talking about work, I was in the office on both weekends. It can be quite the refuge on weekends. There is no one else but me. An escape from everything else. But yesterday I had the sudden urge to go home – the one with my siblings living in it – even before I had completely finished the work I set out to do. Probably because of the looming storm that I wanted to leave fast. Grabbed some junkies along the way (yes I picked up a few heroin addicts from Watson’s…) and cabbed it. It was nice catching up with Heidi who had a lot to catch up with me – ranging from Lion King to her birthday cake to her birthday present (a big Simba or was it Mufasa?), about how high heel shoes hurt and you can’t jump with them on. Dickhead looked a little down so I got him ice cream so he can cheer up. I didn’t even twist his arm for getting me vanilla Coke instead of the diet version. Loobz made me laugh when he sang a song with Heidi’s new plastic guitar from Uncle Jelte. Bobo was busy scurrying here and there. Wang was busy playing techno and then alternative and then pop… DJ Confused … all in all, the house was cheerful and smelled clean and delicous. Even my room hee hee. Bobo and Loobz fixed nasi lemak for dinner – it was what my stomach was waiting for its whole life! Bobo almost made me cry when it was time I left, hanging on the grille, sad to see me go (vice versa). It would have been nice if I came back for good but right now I am not sure what the plans with Jelte are yet. We have to talk about our savings, bills and travel. On Saturday we will open up a joint account.   I had a fantastic lunch today! There is a new Peranakan place downstairs from my office called Nonnie's. I had ayam buah keluak, fried fish with sambal belachan and rice. Cost me under $8 for the lot.

      Since our cocktail tasting with Morton’s GM was canned, I remained in the comfortable climes of my pajamas. After finishing some work, I met up with Jelte and Hooker (our new 'recruit' Richard Hooker). We went to Sandra’s for champagne & wine and dinner together with Yvonne. Our tummies suitably lined, we moved on to vodka shots. Drunk as skunks, around midnight we got restless so we trooped to Shazam’s, half a klit away. There, they had cheese sandwiches and more vodka shots with Ribena (which were not that well-received btw). I was sleepy at 2am so I played the xbox. After two fourth places in Burnout 2, I snuck into Shazam’s room for a kip. I was in the right outfit so might as well act the part. Boydie and Big John turned up later. When I awoke later, an xbox party was in full swing and the house’s population had increased by 30%. That’s what professional adults do on Saturday nights at 4am. Play computer games together. I was refreshed but it’s past Jelte’s bedtime. We shared a cab with Hooker. There was a police stop near home. They stopped our taxi and asked Hooker who was seated in front, “You all come from where hah?” Hooker said, in his very English accent, that he comes from Clementi. We had no more problems after that.

      We are not going to Pangkor anymore. Gone are the carefree days with my friends, some of whom are coming from Kuala Lumpur, in my yet-to-be-bought electric blue halter-kini, lying on a hammock with Jelte in the sunshine… the Malaysian side of the organisers had fukced things up big time. Problems with the location, they said. I don't see anything wrong with Pangkor Laut but I am just glad I got my money back. Saw $1.6k sitting in the ledger balance side of my savings account last night. Maybe we should use the Beaufort dirty-weekend voucher that Shazam has given to Jelte for his birthday… but it’s not mine… hee hee.   The other goldfish at work has passed away too. The day he died, we thought he had grown affectionate towards the right back corner of the tank, not swimming towards fish food when we fed him. Hey, we are not rocket scientists you know. This is a magazine office! All we know how to do is prtend to be busy and after that, drink beer. Anyway, the next day, he (or she) was still there. 'Still' being the operative word. It was Dead. Dead as Zed is dead. Zed is Dead… Pulp Fiction. Feel like watching it again.   And home… I miss home. Home is my room, where Dickhead is staying in now. It's where Loobz and Bobo and Wang and Heidi and – I read somewhere – the mad critter Cha Cha live. If I came home, Dickhead would have to bunk in with Loobz and Loobz wouldn’t like that would you Looby Dooby? I miss watching Pulp Fiction just for fun. Playing Massive Attack in the evenings and Rapture in the mornings. I miss my Issey Miyake perfume. But anyway Jelte does not like it there. My whole house is about the size of the whole of his third floor, which is the narrowest part of his house. And though I have a pc in my room, it’s not wired up. But Serangoon North is nearer to his office at Toa Payoh… oh what to do? So many places, so little of me.  Alright I’d better shovel on. Have Mahen and Nadia’s wedding story to file in (for my WEDDINGS feature remember? You HAVE to keep up with reading my blog, you slack cat). Dinner shall be with Yvonne at Sandra’s later, and then at 10pm, the three of us will sample 30 cocktails with Morton’s of Chicago’s GM (aka General Moron, tee hee) at three different steakhouses – incognito. Market research (and seen about town with three outstandingly gorgeou... intelligent ladies) for him, a happy client for Yvonne, free cocktails for us (I hope they have beer).   I have to go home first (home? which home? where is home? what is home?). I swear I am wearing my pajamas now. Let's just say I left the house (in this case, his) in a hurry this morning as a result of a stupid quibble...

      We had them last night :). Lame I know. But it's true, so…  Watched this characteristically bizzare Kaufman film with my better Jelte, Sandra and Shazam last night. What brilliant cinematography about memories, the mechanics of memories in relation with the mind, and with the present, and perhaps even love. It's the kind of film that leaves you feeling dazed, like you have to be pulled back towards the ‘real world’, when it is over. Though a little disturbing at first, the natural way the story is told becomes easier to perceive later on. Though graphic, the scenes were beautifully orchestrated. It was the visual collage of your mind. Or that’s what they want you to think anyway.   Moseyed over to Shazam’s after that for a beer. “One for the road”, we say. Had one, had two, then Sandra suggested popping open the Dom in the fridge. What occasion, eh? Hey, I signed my first PO today, Shazam said. What’s a PO, I asked. A purchase order, Shazam said. For when I get the contract to design DFS watch section. So, popped one… then a second one. Time flew. Oh, it’s 11pm, we better leave soon hey baby? Jelte said to me. Okay. He played one round of Burnout on the xbox, got first place, so played the second one out of five. Shazam nuked us some of his briyani from Sri Lanka. Can you stay over, he asked us. We teased him about the astronaut upstairs before that. He has a full-sized astronaut figurine upstairs. We told him that Mr Astronaut will walk down the stairs and ask to sleep with him. Hee hee. We didn’t stay. When the tandoori chicken (also from Sri Lanka) was heated up, we left for home.

      I was shaking in my non-existent socks. I was meeting this American writer/ humorist and I didn't realise how big of a shot she is until I scoured the net for last-minute info on her. And found out how big she is. Well at least in the 70s and 80s. Even Playboy magazine did a story on her! I wasn't prepared. I didn't have a tape recorder, and I have even less questions for her.   But it turned out much better than I made myself to believe. If I were to take her word for it, we are having beers next time.   ;)

      My liver needs a break so after four cocktails - two appletinis, a cosmopolitan and a chocolate martini - I decided not to join Jelte & Yvonne to Shazam's and instead go home. After a good shower and a coat of Origin's Ginger Soufflé body cream, I snuggled up in bed with my Glamour UK mag (Bobo, check this magazine out, you'll love it!). And then The Sandman came knockin'. I couldn't get up, my eyes were opened but I couldn't stop the lights from switching on and off and they wanted to take away Fondue. I was asleep on my side and I felt a lot of presence at my back and I screamed but no one could hear me. Ten minutes later, I managed to fight my way 'awake'. I sprinted to my cellphone and rang Jelte up, scared out of my tits. He didn't have to and I love him for it, but he raced back in a cab, hanging onto the phone with me all the way. Fifteen minutes later, he was by my side.

      Happy Birthday Baby! B'day Brunch for Jelte with Cora & Joris on 4 Apr 2004.  urlLink

      First I have been spaced out, now I need my proverbial space. This morning like all other mornings, Joris (his dad), Jelte (him) and me (myself) were driven to work (almost to work, for me, to Toa Payoh MRT station to be exact) by Cora (his mom). Because of the time of the day, it was understandable why people get cranky. So, we were cranky about jeng, jeng, jeng, Shrek 2.   Both of us squabbling like kids at the back of the car. I thought it is a fun film to watch even for kids and he didn’t entirely agree. Which was fine but he didn’t have to have the last word about it and I wasn’t going to give him so I said “ it was what I thought about him, and you can keep your own opinion”. It was worse than it looks here… for me at least. It was stupid. Especially because his parents were there. This is the second time I lashed out on the way to work. Maybe I am not good with people in the morning.   I got thinking. If it was my own family, it will be funny. And I won’t feel bad. And he won’t feel bad. It’s too serious in the morning and I hate Toa Payoh. But if I don’t go with them in the morning, I will take a cab from Coronation. Or I have to leave an hour earlier. Maybe I should go home.  Don’t know why but I was so depressed (don’t ask, maybe I waited too long to have my coffee), I bought Citibank insurance at 9.15 this morning. And breakfast from McDonald’s.   Fuck it.

      This is the second day that I am being utterly useless at work. I have style and events to finish by Friday, an interview with madcap Jewish author Fran Lebowitz Thursday, a martini tasting tomorrow (appletini)… and my WEDDINGS story to finish next week! First my new editor sends me to s spa in Koh Samui, then she made me turn up for a champagne brunch on a Friday and now I am supposed to write a feature on holy matrimony. Or un-holy matrimony… I am sniffing out for the unconventional. But ack. I have lost two days’ of brain activity. Mblog was also down all day… like me. Watched Shrek 2 with Jelte after work and I highly recommend it! The Puss in Boots/ Antonio Banderas combination is one killer cocktail.

      So you have read about me larging it on Friday night. Saturday night was even bigger than large. It was uncontrollable debauchery. We were the 24 Hours Party People. All in the name of offering a friend our shoulders to cry on. Though he didn’t actually cry. We haven’t seen one of our mate Shazam for years and years (actually just two or three months but it felt so) ever since his gf moved to Singers. Saturday afternoon saw a flurry of SMSes sent to Jelte that finally relayed the message that his relationship has ended. He had even helped her pack up her bags–which wasn’t hard considering she hasn’t actually unpacked most of her belongings. So off we went to the Cow after my chicken rice dinner not really feeling like leaving the safe, warm and dry confines of home with full stomachs (I had two helpings) and our alcohol stream still filled with too little blood. After all those lost time Shazam admitted to actually being shy to be coming out and have a few cold ones with us. But as time went by, he threw caution to the wind and managed to just bare his soul little by little. And more and more… till the following evening. After 20 hours of being awake and drinking copious amounts of beer at his, stepping out of the scene of crime as we walked into the light again to grab a taxi home hit us pretty hard in the face, longing more than ever for a good wash and the fluffy bed. Suffice to say that Cora looked more than a little bewildered to see us stumble home with bags under our eyes looking like The Simpson’s characters (for some reason lack of sleep and too much alcohol make one inherit a yellow pallor). It was a good long sleep and we are both at work today, feeling better than we thought we can ever feel again.   Next party – Pangkor June 5-7! I so crave the sunshine, sand and salty breeze… time to get new swimmies. I saw this nice little halter top tankini in electric blue. Perfect for spending 24 hours in!

      Dear Fans  I tried to make some changes to my site and look what happened! My calendar has dipped to the bottom, my fonts are waaay too big, there are no line spacings between entries and the shade of pink is wrong wrong wrong. And how come I cannot load up my photo? And why can't I even have wallpaper effects like my siblings'? I am supposed to be the creative one.  Yesterday was 12 hours of alcoholic hedonism. It was free free free everywhere. We only spent on our own dinner (plus beers with) and cab home. Unlike last weekend, I managed to keep my white top white :).   Stumbled home at about 1am and his folks were not even home yet. I was drunk as a skunk (note: I don't get drunk, just royally tipsy). But Jelte's tummy does not like beer to be mixed with vodka and champagne... let's just say he deserved to be served eggs and a cup of tea in bed.   Cora is making us chicken rice for dinner yummo, I can't wait!

      Five of us ladies at work reshuffled the whole office seating plan yesterday. We were sick of the unproductive lay-out which leaves us with less time for beer everyday :). The art director was sitting near the smoking area, I was pretty much sitting in the stairwell, the circulation manager was sitting beside the goldfish (the other one passed away), the sales team was sitting with the creatives, and the editor was sitting in a box.   The publisher is still in the red-carpeted mezzanine laced with large dark wood furniture.   So for three hours we heaved and we hoed, we went on all fours pondering about the destinations of multicoloured wires, we argued about who owns the pink chair (I do). We did a pretty good job considering that the only two other men - the publisher and the gay boy - were not there. The publisher er, had to go, and the gay boy is still in Koh Samui (having spliffs and riding a Vespa with his soft toy in his backpack, he told me).  After work we celebrated with pints and pool of course (my boy arrived to join the celebrations even though he had little to do with our moving of heavy furniture and removing doorways...).   Came in this morning having to dodge out of the electrician and IT guys' ways. Glad to leave for lunch with a gal fren at noon. I was made to believe that I was attending her office warming but in the end it was beer lunch with her and my renegade ex-boss at BQBar. Apprehensive at first, I was glad to meet up with him after almost half a year. I am still working in the magazine he was fired from. Now I am in her office waiting for us to go to the second floor of this building for a game of pool - the other thing she promised.   It's Friday and there is a Cartier-do to plonk champers at later, a CD launch at Embargo, Fly Entertainment's anniversary at Centro (upstairs from Embargo) and a MediaCorp party at INK, where her boy deejays. My boy will be meeting us at Cartier.  Am I dressed appropriately? I am wearing a white muscle tanktop and dark blue jeans and heels. And my shocking pink handbag. Great!

      People should learn that sometimes to stop talking is better than to carry on a conversation that is leading nowhere or worse, causing anger or hurt. That period, thoughtfully placed in the midst of a sentence that has begun swelling in the direction of causing upset, is well worth a million more words by its initiator.   Anyway, someone I know will be moving to Vietnam next week to teach English. Something, or rather some things, in me stirred with the hearing of that news. Words along the lines of ‘it should have been me’ formed in my head and in my heart. But I am someone who believes in flow, of the natural order of things. To pack up my bags and do that today will not be as rewarding as me going when I am actually ready. Among others, I should first see a little bit more outside of my increasingly uncomfortable so-called comfort zone. And a TOEFL certificate in teaching English wouldn’t harm either.

      Let me talk about this morning’s Morning Humour. I was so tired and didn’t want to wake up this morning. Went upstairs at 9.30pm last night and tried to get comfortable. At 10pm, God turned off the lights. My whole world went ‘BLUB’. Then, darkness. Blood drained from my face and three things sprang to mind. Can’t remember what they are now but I was so afraid. Grabbed my phone and the same time I rang for Jelte who was downstairs at the time, the duvet and I sprinted to the door. Simultaneously I heard Jelts shout “it’s okay baby!”   Apparently we were not the only ones in the dark. The island was afflicted with blackouts everywhere. I called my siblings and even Donny called me – not about blackouts, but about seeing me on TV. The news showed me at the Dutch club cheering the game.   It rained all night till morning. Jelts woke me up at stupid o’clock because I was literally pushing him over the edge. I had to steal his body warmth and he had a hard time staying in bed. When the alarm clock screamed in the morning, I couldn’t, wouldn’t, shouldn’t have to wake up. I cannot get out of bed if my mind has not made itself up about what to wear.   But I had to and was very angry about it. After the shower, I pulled on my turtleneck. Tried to feign being awake by drawing my eyes. The eyeliner chose this very morning to have a fight with me! I screamed because it wouldn’t listen to me. It didn’t do what I wanted it to do! Jelts commented if I was having a bad time. I roared at him. He laughed and left me in the bathroom. I tried to wash it off and the whole thing smeared my left eye. It became a huge black patch. I had to wash five times! My eyes hurt and I was so sad, disappointed and angry. My boyfriend walked into the bathroom, and of all things he said “sorry”.   That made me feel really stupid for fighting with a make up. He said he had never heard me roar before.   Welll, neither have I.

      I bought a packet of ciggies today. The worst I could find! The cheapest! Only $7! Before you let out a sigh of ‘she’s got  the willpower of a peanut’, listen up. The think is, Eda and I planned yesterday to have a pack in the office to share. Works for me coz rather than go cold turkey, I am telling myself “I don’t need it”. And thus, only smoke when I need to. Like when pooing.   Rather than go from 20 to zero, I am doing it 20 to 2. And two weeks from now... who knows? I will graduate to social smoker. Anyway, honest be told, today I already had two smokes and not much else. But I told Jelts yesterday (when I also had two whole sticks) that my throat feels rougher now than when I was a chimney. Today, I am finding breathing a little more challenging.   Could it be the tentacles of work stress that have wound themselves around my neck?  Does my chest feel tight because of the load on my shoulders?  Am I having a heart attack? (No pain in left side of body... prod, prod… all good)

      I was so tired yesterday. I was also busy but my brains wouldn’t cooperate with me. At 4pm I was ready to go home but I gritted my teeth and waited for Jelts. Actually I didn’t want to go home for a kip and work from there because of Joris. Jelts thinks it’s funny, me being afraid of his dad. Anyway I was fetched at about 6.15pm and we had a nap before dinner. I finished my work later but he didn’t (norty). We watched the Paris Hilton and a Croatian actress’ sex vids. Hilton has a lot to learn about pleasures. Preferably from the Croatian gal.

      We got home at almost 7am last night, from football. Woke up and found text messages from Shazam. They were at Substation and asked us to join for lunch. Jelts was ill from alcohol/ wan tan noodles poisoning. I fixed him eggs and toast to soak up the bad stuff from his tummy. But my slimy egg yolk (the way he likes it, actually, what have I done wrong!) encouraged vomit to projectile out of his guts. And thus, he did not feel nauseas anymore now. But he did have a pretty bad case of diarrhoea for most part of the day...  There was a Punk Rock music event at Substation. I felt liberalised just looking at their outfits. The geek/ corporate look is in, according to the punksters. The girls were decked in shirt and jacket over mini skirt. Hair pulled back with scrunchies and a clip to tuck fringes away from faces. Fishnet stockings and white socks with Doc Marten’s (I didn’t realise you can still get those) finish the look. Boys had thick glasses on, skinny pants, bomber jackets, fur even!, on tartan – another favourite design – with black boots. Everyone danced like ronggeng like that. It was Ska Society. The music was part ethnic, part tribal, part screams part synthesizer. I was flabbergasted to see the young uns on stage, singers screaming words out and a full brass band playing along. Trombones, trumpets, cornets, saxophones.    Sunday brunch at Substation   urlLink     The kids drank Coca Cola while they danced to punk rock while we stood around taking pictures and drinking frozen margaritas. Because we can hee hee. I tried jumping like them to the music but my tits almost fell out of my singlet so I had to stop. After lunch we left to eat, err, another lunch at Great World City. We wanted to book Gold Class tickets anyway.  Walked around GWC, followed Hooker look at sofas. Six people enquiring about the one chocolate leather sofa. Heh. Walked around furniture some more and Jelte waited for us at cinema. He hates shopping. Me too but I was having fun getting lost in mock living rooms.   Wanted to watch Hairy Prata 3 but they had no 9pm tix and Gold Class is shwoing crappy Around the World. So we settled for Troy in Normal Cinema Number X. Went to Shazam’s to watch the rest of Sex season 6 and wait for 9pm (have to return to Jason tomorrow)(fuck! I forgot to remind Coxi to buy for me from Jakarta!).   The guys and Sandra laughed at Troy but I cried. They thought it was overtly dramatised but to me, it’s mythology so more than a little exaggeration is in order. Actually I think Hooker likes it too. Jelte found it okay. Shazam thought Brad Pitt is too pretty.   Took a cab home. I got no more money so Jelte paid for everything. At home, I finished reading Valley of Horses! Now, The Mammoth Hunters.

      On Saturday, I went to the circus for the first time with Jelte. Funny but halfway through the show, I felt like I have been to one before. I am still unsure but it could be reminiscent of my family actually :o)…  Before that, we met my old friend Tini at Yishun. She has just started to sell makeup and skincare stuff. I bought suncreen lotion from her for $36. The $60 Biotherm one I got, I gave to Sandra cause it is too ‘rich’ for my stupid skin. It was good seeing her again. With good friends, you may only meet once a year or so but gaps of time in between meetings are insignificant.   After the circus – which was enjoyable enough but I’d never pay to watch one… unless it’s Cirque du Soleil… not that I’ve paid for it – we headed home. I had 3 discs of Sex and the City season 6 to finish watching. At about 1.40am we set off in a cab with Joris to go to the Dutch Club for the Holland VS Sweden game.   It was… a very weird game! I am not complaining coz after all the Cloggies won 1-0! But to me, the untrained eye, it was an unusual competition. Tried as they might, close as they get, good they played, stupid as they were, neither side scored anything in the first half. Repeat those acts in the second half, nothing was scored again. The worst scenario for the Dutch team and their supporters all over the world happened – penalty kicks tie-breaker. Fact has it that for the last four or five Euro games, the Dutch team has always fucked up penalty kicks. They can’t seem to put the ball through to the net at all. We are so gonna lose, the general air sunk heavily. Especially on my eyelids. I was ready to fall asleep on the Dutch Club’s event room floor. But the Dutch team matched score for score until the third one which they missed! And the Swedes missed one too. Now Fate hung on the last Dutch guy’s boot. One kick and – it’s IN!  WE WON!  Suddenly it seemed like sunshine now filled the whole room. I was sleepy and a little tipsy too by now. Big John and his mates came for the first half and they left us with many drink coupons. .Jelte and I had tipsy fight on  the way home – it’s become standard routine to signify our drunken state. We bicker like two Mr Burns from The Simpsons before stumbling into dreamland. As usual, he slept first while I read (yes, read… even when drunk and sleepy). Hic........ zzzzz.

      These are places that we did NOT go to last night. We planned, we executed ideas, but for one reason or the other, none happened.   Our evening began with Jelts and I at a Stella Artois event at Fort Canning green. For the Win a Date with a Celebrity contest. I think I gave Jelte his first journalistic interview experience while I stepped back to sidekick role of holding tape recorder. I wrote down some questions that i think were siginificant and then I got him to shoot them to the date winners and Melody Chen and Sivert Ong. The whole event was pretty lame, and the two 'stars' were lacklustre but hey, I am just a tape recorder holder ;o)  So, it was good. We had a couple of beers there, and later wines and champagne at Sandr'as. She invited us to celebrate her first pay check from Clinique.    Sandra 1st pay toast   urlLink      Tits out   urlLink      Tittie boy (Hooker)   urlLink     Didn't know what else to do in small tiny Singapore so Hooker and his mate James, the Ss and J&L decided to go to JB. Cabbed home to grab passports and toothbrush. But Hooker rang to say his passport was in his office.   So scrapped JB, wanted to go Velvet now (yes, right, in my JB clothes!!). Then I remember, Spencer is spinning tonight, Marx too. At HPL House. Jeng jeng, I so clever.   It was another Kinemat party. It's a 'private' event, like Alter Ego. Saw Haikel and Ash there. Belle - or Ayu - is looking good now that is pregnant again. She got this pink flowy top thing and fisherman's pants, scarf on her head, boogieing.   Aaargh! We also saw the MTV Golliwog who flashed his black cock into my face at Big John's house on his birthday! Shazam and Jelte got really excited and walked over to him by the wall, taunting him with such pleasantries as ‘we hear you have shown something to our girlfriend at big john’s house…’ (baby help I forgot exact dialogue). Anyway he walked away and I didn’t see him anymore. Though he is prolly in the toilet showing his ebony schlong to some cornered bird somewhere else…   More wirdness. Koreen (Adrienne) suddenly professed her love for my friendship, Cheryl Fox is quite tiny in person (she gave a me a cigarette - I am still not buying. I had like four cigarettes all Friday). And the girl from Sex in Lion City (see previous blog of similar title), Joanna Fullerton or 'my real name is Ciara' flirted with Shazam at the bar - she is EXACTLY like her Samantha Jones persona of that play! Touchy feely like she knows him. How dare she touch my friend's partner like that. Out of this world. I squeezed in between to grab my vodka redbull which Sandra took from me later anyway.   It was very small and dark and smoky smoky smoky! My tummy ached, I needed to poo (cigarette laxative effect?) I had a shit at Orchard Parade hotel next door in the gents while Jelte waited for me by the sink.   Back at Repercussion's black hole, Lyes waved to me at the lift landing. Looked like he is standing in a bright place. We walked over, and saw the inside oh Hard Rock's upper floor. It was cold and smoke-free (coz has no one there). I sat Jelts down (smoke got in his eyes so he needed to stay for a bit) and went to get the rest.   That was when I saw Ciara (Joanna?) flirt with Shazam, delaying my cocktail from reaching me. Anyway the posse joined in and Shazam and Hooker went to the unattended bar to re-enact a scene out of Cocktail, it appeared to me. I told them there is a camera there watching, above the curtain. So Hooker smuggled a bottle of Jim Beam into my Paul Frank bag. Yes, my friends.  They had enough and wanted to go back to Shazam’s. Jelts had to go home. Which was good coz they went to Lola and the next day when we are going to the circus, they were all unapproachable, hungover and unapproachable.

      Everyone's in the office now, everyone's smoking. I took a puff off Maria's cigarette and one more from Jason. I want to smoke a whole stick by myself but I am holding off till I have to spend quality time on the throne.

      I haven't had a cigarette since, what? 11.30pm last night? As if that wasn't bad enough, I didn't manage to have coffee at home this morning. I had to chew on Jelts' head a couple of times. Then, it was a torture to go to the coffeeshop near work to order iced coffee without asking for a pack of Marlboro Lights as well.   In the office niw. I need to poo. But can't poo without a fag. It's like having coffee without sugar, lime juice without vodka, a bar without pool table, life without Jelte's head to gnaw on. Ah... Eda has just walked into the office. She will give me one. She walks over to me, "Beb rokok ada beb?".   My anticipation deflated. "But Maria is buying, she's in soon," she continued.  There isn't hope yet :)

      Went to watch Hossan, Kumar and Joe’s stand-up and ‘improv’ comedy at Raffles’ Long Bar after work. It was very packed and a little unpleasant. It is fantastic news that people, expats and locals alike, are flocking to watch a trio of locals tickle their funny bones. Either the mindset that used to cloud the value of homegrown talents is gone, or the low ticket price at $10 is the big catalyst. Hmm… maybe both.   We took leave off work today morning so that we could watch Holland vs Latvia game at the club. But none of us were disciplined enough to get up when the alarm went off at 2am. The next thing I know, it was 10am and Holland had surprised me very pleasantly by not playing like ballerinas.  I am only assuming that because they qualified themselves for the next part of the Euro 2004. Hurrah!  Guess this Saturday we’d better nnot get any headaches so we can catch the football fever Live! at the  club. Oh, talking about headaches, Jelts get headaches from smoking ciagrettes very often. Indeed, it has at last been proven that I am not the guilty party. So this is my last pack that I am gonna buy.

      Jelts & I and the two Ss caught Pitch Black on DVD last night before sprinting to the nearby cinema to catch the sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick. I am already very busy one day after the magazine went to print. It’s usually two weeks of loafing around. Because after next week, my editor goes to the UK plus I have got almost back-to-back people to interview (tonight, Hossan Leong, Joe Augustine & my twin, Kumar), shows to review (Moscos Circus on Saturday!), and stuff to preview (like ‘chi’ water spa at Shangri-La, Friday).   I’d better get some work out of the way now.

      True to our promise, Jelts and I spent some time with Cora last night. BTW I didn’t realise that Joris had gone to Holland.   But first, an amazing experience. I was supposed to meet with Jelts at Orchard MRT after work. He said he would wait at the exit leading to our bus stop. So I got out of the gantries, picked up three rum balls to eat, and I took the escalator up.   From the escalator, I looked up and saw a tall, young man leaning against the staircase. He had a leg rested over the other, reading intently. His longish hair flopped down and I couldn’t tear my eyes away from him. He was damn attractive. My heart skipped a beat as I reached the floor. I walked quietly up to him and then, I kissed him.   It was Jelte.   After dinner, as usual when the three of us are alone, especially after we have had a couple of cocktails, Cora asked us if we wanted to play ‘Rummikub’, a tile game using numbers and a good memory.  I always win this game so Jelte wasn’t interested:o). Then I said, let’s play for money. Everyone put their books away.   I went up to grab my piggy bank and the table was set. At first gambling 10-cents for each point lost, we then increased that to 20-cents. ‘Because don’t have challenge’, Jelte said. I lost all of rounds. I lost $7.50 of which most went to Cora.  I don’t want to play anymore.

      This was a somewhat languid day.  Met the posse up at Samy's for out-and-out Indian banquet complete with banana leaves and eating with (only our right) hands. I think our toothless Indian waiter likes me. Hee ole-wayz zmiled hiz toothlez zmile at mee and shoog his head a lot ad mee. He also gave mee many food many timez.   We had sambal prawns the size of my palm. We had chicken tikka, mutton dhal, fish head curry, fried fish, chicken korma, pappadums... many, many glorious types of sinful, fattening, rich, spicy, delicious Indian food slapped onto our banana 'plates'. Ohhh... the thought of them brings water to my mouth even now. So cheap, lah. We ate like pigs and only a hundred bucks for the five of us.  We decided to walk from Dempsey Road to  urlLink  Botanic Gardens  to settle our full tummies and for ginger tea. It was quite funny how that was entertainment in itself. First we ventured into a few warehouses selling antiques. Then we poked our heads into some abandoned colonial houses. Then as we walked down the road towards the garden, we saw a large spider building his web in the trees -quite spectacular. Then we saw another spider. We got to the garden, walked thru the purple orchids, sat down at Halia for frozen mocktails and to cool down. Meandered through the rainforest. Had ice cream at Café Les Amis.   Jelts and I went to Tanglin Mall after that while the rest headed home to rest. I need shoes! My shoes are all dead now. Need shoes for birthday! I already got a Levi's collector's jeans No. 769 (thanks Shazam!) to wear.. now need shoes. But, no size for me. Instead we bought Hooker a pet. A pet cat. A helium-filled pet cat with four paper legs that walks when you pull it along with its string.   Went to Hooker/ Shazam's. Oh, Hooker has already moved into his block. Four floor of Hooker, tee he. I got pantyliners but left it at Hooker's when we delivered the housewarming cat. We chilled, then we caught the 9.30pm Around the World in 80 Days which was crap. A no-brainer comedy flick with big names and tired clichés. But still brought a couple of laughs and Owen Wilson was a welcome cameo in my books. The funniest part was seeing Richard Branson (Virgin air) operating the hot air balloon rides set at he turn of the century.

      Sentosa was fun yesterday! We decided to go pass Trapizza and on to the next barstop, Sunset Bay. At first we thought the place was lively. It was packed and they played Black Eyed Peas' Where Is The Love. But the staff and even the crowd had a rather aggro attitude like waddafark. They had a pool table and when we played, three teenage girls wanted to play too so Jelts and Shazam let them play the next table which was rightfully mine (I said OK). Sorry to say this but Singaporeans should really learn first to wait for their turns and be graceful about giving back some. The next table they gave to two boys who wanted to play, and I approached them pointing to the board where you write your names for a turn. Since they already put money in, I let the boy play with a girl. Bla bla bla, awful place, too much crowd, loud music, staff who behaved like we owe them money, and rickety old pool table with holey balls and damned cue sticks, we left.  Went to rent bikes in search for the next better bar yonder. Have wheels, will find next bar. And Bora Bora was much, much better. As soon as we have parked our bikes, the staff went “Helloooo…! Hellloo!”. This was where we spent the rest of our time in Sentosa making merry. There was a big yellow floaty contraption in the water that I thought was the coolest thing I ever saw – after Jelte that is ;o). It was a slide on water thing. You swim up to it, clamber up and you slide down straight into the water. If I had swum that day, I’d take over it and make it my own private island… err… shared with 17 wet, dark teenage boys who clearly had the same thoughts.   We moved to the beachfront with our pina coladas and watched the sunset (it was really quick, like 30 seconds). Then we decided to cross the suspension bridge close by, to ‘Asia’s most southernmost point’. On the bridge, we walked with our legs apart, pushing down really hard with each step, so as to cause maximum wobble. I think the students right behind us enjoyed it.   It was crowded on the way out of the island. We decided to walk out. They had constructions going on the side of the causeway, closing the traffic in on us even more than the traffic jam already had. At one point, Jelte and I separated from Shazam and Sandra. We walked into a gap that led into the construction area, as it was away from traffic. It was rather dark and filled with large square holes on the ground. But there was nobody else there. It was quite a long walk and I realised too late that we might not find another gap to walk out of. But I noticed gaps underneath the metal walls so I gathered we could roll out on our sides.   After 10 minutes, we reached the end. A dead end. With its gap blocked out with heavy materials. Like sandbags. But up ahead at the closing point, the narrowest point, there was a gap below. Right beside a drain, and too small to roll out of. You gotta be pulled by your ears. It was too far to walk back, we have gone this far. Jelts went first (I hate to think that I might emerge in the midst of foreign workers having coffee break). Traffic was zooming past.   Jelts went on his tummy and pulled himself up, save a slipper. It was a little too low for adults to come out easily of – you gotta press your cheek against the tar – but he managed somewhat easily. But how am I supposed to do this with my boobies in my way? I looked behind me, it was dark and I was alone now. What if a wild and hungry dog or a construction worker came along from the shadows? What if I fell into the drain? I didn’t wanna be there with a dog or in the drain so I recovered from my what-were-we-thinking mode in a split second. I threw him his slipper, and my bag and his bag and now, it was my turn to escape from my imaginary enemies.   Went down on my tummy, fitted okay, breasts turned out not as big as I thought (hee hee). Wriggled like a soldier, stuck my head out and saw a big bus on my right, prayed to God no one was laughing at me. Felt conscious about my arse being exposed on the other side of the fence as I was wearing a short white dress. What if a dog came and bit my arse? Jelte was picking up the bags, I asked him to pull me out. He struggled with the load and me, and I fought my way out as dignifiedly as I could. It was all over in six seconds. Shazam crossed the construction barricades to greet us just in time. Mission accomplished! I got scrapes on my knees and ankles but we were now free. Took cab to Shazam’s for SBX – shower, beer and xbox before Dutch vs Czech game at 2.35am. Shazam needs to stock up pantiliners and a comb in his place.   I rested on Shazam’s couch and at 2am, Jelte needed us to skip the watching football and go home as he had planet Mars for a head. It was the return of The Migraine again. We had spent much time in the sun today, and had drunk all day and night. The continued hours in front of the plasma TV playing games, instead of resting, had fried his brains. We went home and I read my book in bed, as I was already rested by then.   Tomorrow, we eat vedi good curry at Samy’s.

      So Sex in the Lion City (as it's correctly called) and the four-course dinner at Ristorante Teatro was um, so-so. I was invited to review the show. My colleague Shalu and her hubby Sean joined us.   The food. The breads came with delicous tangy salsa dip. We kept asking for fourths. The first starter, porcini mushroom soup served in a large plate was creamy & delicious, with shroomy bits floating about but was served at warm-ish temperature. The room was cold - we borrowed the staff jackets - so we had to scoop the soup up quickly before it turns to porcini ice cream.   The second starter was black pasta with seafood. That was rather pleasant for me as just before dinner, Eda was talking about black pasta which I have never eaten. Apparently it's made with squid ink. Mine was served with prawn, scallop and squid rings in familiar looking bread dip salsa-looking sauce.   I picked beef for my main as I had fish for lunch. My salmon lunch was served with rice and mayonnaise - harrowing! They should not serve rice with mayo. My medium beef was cooked right but it's a little too salty outside and the flavour contrast strakly with the rest of the beef. It was served on a bed of flattened spinach, fried tatoes and onions. Not bad but I didn't finish it. Shalu's a vegan and her main was vegetarian pasta in a sauce that looked and tasted like the salsa bread dip, like our black pasta seafood sauce. Maybe since we liked it so much, they put it in all our foods.  The ending was tiramisu which we suspect was made with fake cheese or a combination of mascarpone ad egg white or soemthing. It lends that plastic taste on your tongue rather than melt into your tastebuds. The espresso base was rather strong. I didn't order after dinner coffees.  We also had two bottle of wine. So the end bill was actually $400+ for uhm, mediocre food and service (staff was very helpful and polite but they do things like reach across your face, nitpick.. nitpick.. nitpick). Mine and Jelte's dinners were free but we had to pay for beverages. So, $80 for four-course italian dinner with theatre and wines on a Friday night... not bad.   Wait. I am suppsoed to review the show not the food! Ha ha... well, read it in  urlLink Expat magazine  August issue ;o)  After Teatro, we went to ATTICA. Very nice place at Clarke Quay. Met the usual party crowd from as long as the old Liquidroom time. Saw Boydie and crew there too. And Chicken Bob who was with Fox. NAturally my polite hellos at that last table was rather snappy.  We spent only the $50 note that Jelte had as our unofficial budget for last night.   Now, I must go. Going to pick up Shazam and Sandra to go to Sentosa for makan and cycling. Hooker is at work - HOOKER ARE YOU READING THIS - you'd better meet us for Dutch VS Czech later.

      I will be turning 26 soon and like I have always said, I embrace aging. I embrace the fact that I have been around the sun so many times, as Jelte says. He can say that, he is a year younger than me. Anyways I do look forward to the age when I will be completely comfortable in my own skin and that I will be wise enough to face the effects of my non-conforming ways. Not that I am not already(ish) now, but it will be a good thing when I don’t have to think or write in blogs about it. What am I saying? It’s Friday!  The beginning of this entry sounded better in my head so I am gonna stop now before I completely ruin it.   So, I have war paint on today. My family must be so proud. Going to attend a dinner theatre thingamajig after work; time to schmooze the events organisers for my new-improved (read: more work for me) Expat Diary section of the magazine. We are going to watch Sex in Singapore City (sounds awfully similar to a particular HBO television series…) (so unoriginal) at Ristorante Teatro at the Esplanade. Do you know what Esplanade means? Not ‘durian’ you silly thing. It means a level open stretch of paved or grassy ground; especially: one designed for walking or driving along a shore.  Trivia? Indeed. Trivial? Not really. Good to know for when tourists ask why the hell did we name our arts centre after flat ground.

      Actually this blog has been under construction ever since it started - thanks to Lilies! It is always bugger, better, faster, more... so bear with me (her), and erh, I have to skate to the bar now - it's Beer O'Clock!

      I loved the idea of owning one of these anti fuzz gizmos ever since before I got one from Jelts two weeks back. Now, I am afraid of it. The promise of being hairless for longer is still not convincing enough for me to let it run its course effectively on my sensitive bits. It's not because it doesn't work - hell, it does. The first time we used it was on Jelts' ankle (the coward). I was still fairly hairless when I just got it so I made a solo attempt on myself a week later. Switched on, it makes a loud "BRRRRRTTDTDZZTZTTT!!!" sound like a lawnmower, dudes! I ran away from the damn thing. Two days ago, I don’t know what got into him (and why I allowed it) but we tried again. I tell you, waxing is better. At least the pain happens in one clean sweep. But for waxes, you have to foster one or two days' growths which is not practical for someone who lives in sleeveless tops. But the spot successfully erh, attacked (it is the right word), looks pretty promising. Will try again today.

      Went home for dinner last night and Mummy has outdid herself again! The promise of pizzas was piled on with her mean chicken curry, sardine courtesy of Bobo, and fried eggs courtesy of Bug. And the apple pie! It looked good; am sure Loobz will concur, but I forgot to eat it. Mum made so much pizza - mine was the size of a table but we were going out so cannot lug tables around, lah.  After dinner we went to Post bar at One Fullerton. Shazam and Hooker were already there by the time we finished eating so I couldn't take Heidi to get her ears pierced. Actually I didn't realise that she wanted me to take her when she called me the night before. Anyway, after Post, we walked to Boat Quay and decided that curry was a good idea. It was during this time that I start to lose my voice. After curry we went to Shazam's to sit out the time before the Holland vs Germany game at 2.30am.  It was fantastic! Not the game - which was a little like watching octogenarians do the rumba - but the atmosphere at the Hollandse Club. At stupid o'clock in the morning, we were sprawled on the floor next to 8-year old boys (and girls), craning our necks up to watch the game on the projector screen. I was in my pink pajama pants and a Calvin Klein (I just found today) T-shirt that Cora got me; emblazoned across the chest with an orange rectangle of German news that carried a picture of a Dutch player lurching his spit in the direction of a German one. Hip hip, Hurray! I don't know how to talk about the game the sporty way.   The Germans scored one before the Cloggies did. It was Van Nilsterooy. Was at the 80th minute, it's a tie! We whooped and I knocked the beer of Monique whose legs I was sitting between, all over her front and my hair.   Guys - watch Channel i News at 8.30pm - we were chanting (I only did a Milli Vanilli lip sync act) the "te de de  de de de... Aan vallen!" I have never heard of before in my life. But I did it with the Cloggies at the Dutch Club. I am, from this morning onwards, an honorary Dutch Lady. We did with such gusto all for the television dah-lings. So catch us on the silverscreen tonight.   And Friday, we will do this all again.

      I just got back from a grumpy lunch with Sarah, my editor. She was grumpy about working till one last night only to find out today that the magazine goes to print on Friday and not tomorrow. She was annoyed that she slogged for nothing. No one tells you anything in this office. Everyone has their own schedules. I am just glad my Weddings story is done, and I have done a MUCH better introduction that is more than just me saying that marriage sucks.   I wonder sometimes how we manage to produce a  urlLink stylish rag  every month. I was just an innocent bystander at that point she found the news out and though no one twisted my arm for it, I found myself sharing her grumpiness in our 'boardroom' that is SODs (Shamus O'Donnel, Irish bar downstairs from work). Now I've got a pint and a cheeseburger 'behind my teeth'. She also bought me a pack of fags.  Anyway, I've had a nasty cough/sore throat - or if you ask my better half, he'd say cooties - and I hope to God I only get really sick on Thursday. The whole office is suffering from this cooties epidemic. Must be something in the air conditioning unit. I think someone throws in a bag of germs in our cooling system each night.   But looking at this 'new schedule', I can take the morning off tomorrow. Gotta finish my Elvis and Heineken Music reviews today. Going to Bobo's to have dinner with Mum then go to Shazam's for... I don't know, whatever we go there for. Tonight I am joining the Cloggies watch the Holland team play soccer against another team, I don't know what, in the Dutch Club. I even got a t-shirt made by Cora. She said it's got Dutch words (probably swear ones) and a picture of a Dutch player who spat on a German player taken off the newspapers some time back.  Sandra's in Hong Kong till Thursday. Thursday we invite ourselves to Hooker's for his housewarming. He's moved to the fourth floor of Shazam's block. Fourth floor of Hooker, Jelts said. Today he sent an e-mail telling everybody his housewarming is on the 9th floor. Ha, ha. That's Shazam's house. We are not going to Batam anymore. I don't know. After that cycling bit, everyone including me seems to just wanna chill and not break any laws.

      I spent most of my Sunday reading  Cave Bear's  sequel,  the Valley of the Horses . These  Children of the Earth  series are pretty damn good. They must be, I spent a good part of a nice hot day with my nose buried in one.  We were invited to Shazam's last night, Sandra cooked boiled carrots as well as boiled leeks with mayo. Served with Mr Boon's chicken. Not bad. I ate leeks. I had to tell myself we were only going for pre-movie drinks at his place, with snacks. But it wasn't so bad. I didn't feel like running away from the table. Maybe we can still go to Big John's, if his offer to dazzle us with his culinary skills on Weds still stands.   After dinner, we hooked up with Hooker at Great World. Jelts and I surprised them with GV Grand tix for 'The Day After Tomorrow'. The crew was chuffed, it was great. They've never been, only I have. We shared a bottle of champagne before the film. Inside the cinema, we had top class recliner seats - great to sleep on, though for once when I should have, I didn't - and blankeys and we were served the nuggets, wedges, Cokes and popcorn that we pre-ordered. Wholesome decadence.   Cool epic film about the ruins of this young earth to watch on a lazy Sunday. Nice way to wrap up our well-behaved weekend.

      I wrote so much at work that I don't have time to write an entry for my beloved blog today!  Anyways, was flipping through Dr Sundardas D A's new book on women's wellness just now. He is a naturopath holistic healer doctor person whom I have heard of time and again for a couple of years now. Happy that his book landed on my lap; it was for me to review actually. The book said that if I bought the book, I can bring it down to the clinic for a free wellness assessment. But I didn't buy it, I got it for free. Should I lie and get a free assessment? I have sent an e-mail to ask how much a wellness assessment costs. But I am convinced enough to go to his clinic and pay good money to find out just how well (or unwell?) I am.

      (a continuation of 'Misfit')   "So I laid me down to sleep, Prayed the Lord my breakfast to keep; If I puked before I wake,  Prayed the Lord my head won't break."   Yes, exercise did all these to me. I was kidding my existence when I believed myself to still be out of breath when we reached home yesterday. I went to the confines of bed to contemplate my sorry state but all I felt was how my head felt like it was too small for my - ahem - large brain. I felt nauseous, felt like hurling up the solo egg and four beers breakfast that I had all day, all day.   And those things for 'breakfast' was only the beginning of my mistakes. I began to wonder if I would ever feel okay again. When this morning I do, I feel like it's my duty to tell all you people what I did wrong in my heartfelt attempts to keep my heart performing at optimum level for at least once in my life.    1) Eat something substantial before or during the exercise:  I had a fried egg and a toast in the morning. Everyone else had lunch too (at the time when I stupidly drank beers!). No one else suffered from the nausea like me - I was practically starving by 5pm without realising it. Jelte explained, "Since you don't execrise at all, you hardly have any muscles to be burnt when you cycled. Thus, the energy you used came from what you have eaten. You haven't eaten much so it has taken quite a toll on you."  If you fail to have eaten and are suffering afterwards, pray that you live with people who'd fix a high-protein meal for you. Cora saved my life with egg salad sandwiches.    2) Do not drink only half a small bottle water plus four mugs of beer when cycling 20 kilometers:  Instead, take sips of at least a big bottle of water.  Only.  No beers - beers, like all alcoholic drinks, are diuretics. We all know it, including me but no one remembers it until its too late. That's what happened yesterday; even Jelte forgot to keep me in check when I was treating exercising like a night out clubbing. They sap the juice out of you and that's what causes migraines - when your body is dehydrated and the sun is slapping you from all directions. What I had was a minor heatstroke.     3) Keep up the fluid intake and eat small amounts throughout the rest of the day:  That evening, we went to the Dutch Club for dinner and there was an event happening. I still felt a little out of whack. I stayed away from all alcohol and stuck with water. Jelte's beer went down my throat like sandpaper! And I couldn't eat. Food made me want to throw up. I managed to stab at a few salad leaves, some chunks of beef, no chocolate mousse. Shazam & Sandra (who are now more or less an item, FYI), and Hooker joined us there later, and later we moved to the bar. Played some pool and after 12 glasses of water, I could finally down a G&T. That's all. We went to Adam Food Centre after that, not a club - what a healthy-lifestyle day - and there I ate more, half a mee goreng.  So there you go! If you are thinking of exerting yourself in the name of health, please follow these simple rules I have newfound respect for. I will try again two weeks later (going to Batam next week), and will tell you how that one goes : )

      I am SO unfit! Sandra & Jason, Jelts & me went to East Coast to cycle today. Actually I planned this triathlon: swim & cycle - play pool - drink beer. I could keep my speed up always, when cycling I am pretty much up there. But it is when it's over - right now - that I am feeling the PAIN.   I think I am still panting when I actually am not. I think I am panting when I am actually here typing away at the computer.   Groaaaan... gotta lie down :(

      There was not one type of alcohol that we did not drink last night. From champagne to beer to vodka to caiprinhas and back to champagne again. And then B52s and pina colada and caiprinhas and more champagne. Let's just say, the combined alcohol we consumed was enough to get a rocket going. And as if Thumper - which is a FAB club  btw - wasn't enough, we also went to INK.  Yes we are a highly irrational bunch. Especially considering that it was a bloody schoolnight.  Thank God I don't feel half as bad as Jelte (and Sarah and Jason, and I highly suspect also Shazam, Sandra and Hooker). I am only very sleepy now. I have already told my editor Sarah that I am going to sleep under my desk when she called just now. She had overslept from too much drinks last night (what are we like?) (it was The Queen's birthday yesterday).   But my heart goes out to my poor little pumkin kitten Jelte! He crashed out when we came home and I was fixing us a snack. I didn't wake him up cause I thought he was so tired. I should have. I feel so guilty now. Because I didn't wake him up, he didn't drink a litre of water before sleeping. The water is essential damage control against hangovers. Without it, Jelts get the Mother of hangovers. And that's what he is suffering from right now as I prance about the office laughing and joking with my colleagues, telling then how great last night was.   I will never let him sleep after a big night out without drinking a litre of water again. Seeing him this morning was painful for me. I think he is suffering from a hangover for the both of us. Jason just walked into office. The minute he saw me, he curled up into a ball and whimpered 'no'. He said I am evil, that he will never go out with me again because he is also hungover.   I feel so guilty because I did not let us go home after Thumper. I feel guilty because I am not suffering from a hangover : (.  I do reek of alcohol though. Light a match in front of my breath and you will get fireworks going.  And oh yeah - Ray Charles is dead.

      Why do social events make me nervous?   Give me an evening shooting pool at a bar, or dancing the night away in a club any day (I mean evening). But sit-down dinner at the table with close friends, lunches with media people or going for press conferences make my skin crawl, my heart race and I immediately feel about 95% smaller. Give me a family reunion and I want to migrate.   My boyfriend, unlike most other men (and one woman - me), he loves visiting people’s houses to sit down and chat and eat. I always end up reading some guy’s Hustler or Sports Illustrated in a corner of the sofa.

      That’s the clock ticking very loudly in my head. Not the biological variety, you purists, I am talking about deadlines. My sitting on my arse have finally brought me to the day that all my deadlines have conspired for. This is the day when I have to file in MUSIC REVIEWS, GALLERY INTERVIEWS, WEDDINGS and lastly and this is the best part – a wedding A-list. For the best money can buy, a Vera Wang dress, a Tiffany ring, shoes by Stuart Weitzman, a limited edition clutch by Lulu Guinness… aaargh! I don’t even know what to wear tonight!  Tonight we are going to the media opening of a swank new joint uptown called – fittingly enough for me – Thumper. Should I don that new black waistless dress or should I just turn up in this white T I just bought last night that I am wearing now? It’s got a pleated shoulder and pretty tribal decoration in pink all over the front. I can just go home and change into my gold heels and pink bag. If I were to wear that dress, I’d have to shave my legs first. And my hair! My hair! I slept on it wet last night and it’s grown all crumpled.   Deadlines! Shit! Have to write Mahen and Nadia’s wedding story first – damn! Where’s my tape recorder?!

      Returned to the office today after two days away. ‘Returned’ is hardly the right word for it. I was practically working still, but only from home. Haven’t been free till now, 3.30pm. I haven’t been 100% since Saturday. Now I’ve got this dull throbbing where I believe my cervix is. Damn PMS.   I am happier with the new intro for my weddings story. But I guess that’s taken too much toll on what’s left of my brains. I got no more ideas of what to write. I’ve turned into Jelte – copying and pasting mass jokes for my post this morning : )  Oh, met Loobz for lunch today. Funny, I forgot about lunch with my colleagues and I planned to meet him downstairs from my office. It just so happened my colleagues and him came down about the same time so we all had lunch together.

      I bought a black dress today! It’s a halter dress with A-line short skirt that is extra-long on the left front side. The back is waist-less. I also bought Biotherms’s sunscreen for my face so I won't have wrinkles when I am 28. I spend most of the time barefaced and in the sun. It was a rather flamboyant buy: $62 but I think it’ll last forever.

      I saw some  urlLink kois  in a pond today after lunch. Jelte & I were at Raffles Medical. We have both got the flu bug. Anyway the kois were in a pool and people had placed rocks around the inner circumference. The pool had a bowl-like appearance, with its perimeter sloping outwards. I thought, why are they making the small place smaller. Then I realised that maybe they wanted to prevent the kois from swimming all the way to the side – and falling over onto the pavement. There, they will flop and die. I pointed that clever observation out to Jelte. He disagreed. He said that if that is so, then we will constantly be finding fish flopping about dying on beaches. The difference, I pointed out to him is, the beach is a gradual slop. Somehow if the waves wash them up, they can still roll down to the water. But here, once they flop out, they can’t flop back in.

      I can’t shake off this uneasy feeling. It has made itself home on my conscience since Friday night. I am having nightmares as a result.   What do you do when someone at the party got too drunk? How much is too drunk? Too drunk according to you, or according to that person?  How long should you wait?  The reason I asked is because I initiated for someone be sent home from Friday night. And till now I’ve been questioning my own judgement.   It wasn’t that early, around 6am. For the past two hours, he was rather off his tree. My intentions were clear – I didn’t want anybody hurt. Particularly after he had broken one of the host’s photoframes. I jumped to catch his fall twice after that.   I sounded the host of the party for his opinion. He wasn’t too happy with the guy either but he was willing to wait and see if he would do any more damage.   But each time the guy swayed, each time he lost his balance, as long as he was standing up, he made me nervous.   It is fair to say that I wanted him to leave because I would feel better.  I walked him down to grab a cab. I spoke to him when he was lacing up his shoes. He asked me ‘why’ and I told him in that he was bumping into people and things and it was making us nervous.   Today I sent him a text message. I apologised about that evening, hoping to see him again soon. There is no reply. I am so worried.   What have I done?

      Was lamenting slightly last night. Wanted to go to the circus but worried that I might be supporting the unethical treatments of animals. Was glad to find out from  urlLink Channel News Asia  that  “There will not be any wild animal acts this time following Singapore's ban on wild animal acts. Instead, the Moscow Circus has substituted its tigers in the magic act with dogs that play football.   Pups playing ball? A strong Russian man pulling a 10-tonne lorry with his teeth?  Rrrr…   I’d like to see  that   one!  If you are interested, here are the deets: Until August 13, 7.30pm Woodlands Square (beside Woodlands MRT station) $19-$55 from SISTIC.

       Scrolling through the short messages in my cell phone – like reading my young blog – always make me feel warm and fuzzy inside. Actually sometimes they make me cringe. There is enough space in my phone for 35 messages. I have 23 messages I never delete. So I though it’s a good idea to ‘store’ them here.    The oldest message I got is from Jelte (of course! I think this is turning into a shrine to him):   11/09/2003, 0938hrs:    We love you too. So much  This was a message from Fondue and him. I think I was staying at home at that time. That’s why I left the fake mouse with him for company.   24/10/2003, 2204hrs, from Jason:     abt the no. to call for depression… 1800-2231313… hope ur gf gets better soon   This was from my lovely colleague and friend, Jason who brought me frozen Absolut Vanilia. I was going through a confusing, painful and depressing (d-uh) phase at that time. No I didn’t need to call these people and recovered with Jelte’s tender loving care.    26/10/2003, 1158hrs, from Loobz:   Waycentral dot com. I wont be so soon to email ya. Comp is prostituted by the three of us here. Happy swimming!   That website rents and delivers DVDs. I was at the Dutch Club swimming (read: paddling) with Jelte and I think Cora too. We had beers and errr… Dutch French fries. The best way to have your carbos! And the mayo is simply heavenly.    31/10/2003, 1139hrs, from Jelte:   Don’t worry baby love super jelte to the rescue  I had a panic attack at work… shivers…    19/20/2004, 1754hrs, from Jelte:   I love you more than a moth loves a flame… and you’re even hotter!  What can I say? He loves me!   29/03/2004, 1943hrs, from Jelte:   I love you pumkin babypie silver lining sausage peanut. My passion!   I was in Koh Samui’s Baan Taling Ngam for work... it was so hard sleeping without him! Thank God for Fondue :)   05/04/2004, 1335hrs, from Jelte:   I love you baby dew drop  He called me a baby dew drop!   14/05/2004, 1156hrs, from Jelte:   Hey babe. I’m crazy about you  This was sent when he was at work   17/05/2004, 0902hrs, from – you guessed it – Jelte:   I love my peanut! With sausages  He decided that I am a peanut. At first it was a comparison between my willpower and a peanut’s. I have no willpower so I am now a peanut. Hey, not having willpower does not mean that I don’t have morals!   18/05/2004, 1027hrs, Jelte:   I love you my grumpy girlfriend! You so cute when your angry!  This was one of a string of three days in succession when I barked in the morning (I am not a morning person, we discovered). I usually face my mornings alone, so I never harmed anyone. But now he works mornings too so... he sometimes (often times) has to bear the brunt of my a’.m. grumpiness’   18/05/2004, 1203hrs, Jelte:   I love you… And I think the world of you  I said something nice to him too   18/05/2004, 1705hrs, Jelte:   Ok love! You already monster! You got my heart  This was in response to my incessant apologies for my morning er, moods   18/05/2004, 1710hrs, Jelte:   its ok. In dutch we have a saying that directly translates into a piss pole. It means that you can use me to piss against because I can take it. Cause I love you!  Again, I was trying to explain my morning incapabilities and hating myself for doing it to him so often. I tried to aid the change in me. I bought 3-in-1 instant coffee to add to my morning glass of milk ; )   [Still six more to go… but so sleepy now. Need to crash. To be continued.. if you can still take it! Nitey nite beautiful people]

      Today is Sunday and I have got to finish  Weddings  by today if I want to enjoy the next two days of slacking. But it’s hard to concentrate on work. I have only just begun to recover from Friday night. We were drinking and partying at Jason’s this time round, until yesterday at 5pm. Without any sleep, at about 1.30pm Hooker and us decided it’d be grand to hit town to keep the alcohol/blood equation unbalanced. I tell you, I had stars in my eyes! That’s what lethargy combined with sunlight does to my sunglass-ed eyes. I missed out seconds of my memory – one moment I was on top of the stairs, next moment we were across the road. Scary shit. I was turning delirious. Couldn’t finish my frozen margarita at Muddy Murphy's, it was all too intense for me. I needed to rest.  So in between keeping me upright, Jelte bid Hooker goodbye as he went off in the opposite direction to locate another drinking hole (how does he do that?!). I had a tiny panic attack when blood drains off my palms and my lips started feeling pins and needles. We headed back to Jason’s (we left our bags there) where I was commanded to go take a kip. After an hour, we called a cab to go home. This time we slept for 14 hours! Oh, Hooker sent an SMS to Jelts at 11.30pm. He was at Cow, still drinking!!!  Today I found out why I was so average yesterday. I got my period. Periods always make me go weak; I also often get anxiety attacks at this glorious time of the month.   At least, that’s what I’d like to think. Imagine, what will I do if I had to stop partying?  Okay, I’d better shovel some work now. Then we might go to Shazam’s for beers tonight ;o)

      Finally the phonecall to Indonesia Embassy actually met with a ring rather than be automatically diverted to the voicemail service, after half an hour. Unfortunately, Jelte DOES need to get an Indoenisa visa done even if it's to go to Batam for 24 whole hours. Cloggies need to bring their passports (minimum six month validity), a passport pic and SIN$70 and wait three working days before approval.   I am so disappointed!!! First Pangkor's cancellation, now even Batam is not happening. What an unlukcy weekend to plan anything for :(. I hope he is not badly affected by this. I still have my two days off on Monday and Tuesday. Guess I will help Cora clean the house on Monday and go meet my sisters on Tuesday.   I am so blooming disappointed. But Jelte & i will have fun on our own, I am sure.   TGIF

      So it’s all set that the usual suspects a.k.a. Jelte and me, Shazam and Kro, Eda and Sandra, and Hooker & Big John are going to Batam tomorrow till Sunday. There was a minor melee yesterday when found out that Sri Lankans and Cloggies (Dutch) need to apply for visa at embassy, unlike the rest of us higher mortals. But then Shazam has got Brit passport and Kro has got Canadian one, so only Jelts is in the piss. And he was so looking forward to going… not after Pangkor’s cancellation that this is happening… So the whole crew starting asking people everywhere for advise/ favours. At the end of yesterday, Hooker confirmed that Jelts wouldn’t be needing any special visa after all. Well and good but Big John just told me over MSN this morning that his golf course contacts in Batam said he msut apply for visa by 3pm today. I have been calling the Indonesia Embassy since 9.45am… there are no more “we’re closed for holidays” message like yesterday but there is no reply, it is always busy… cross fingers…   Answer the goddamn phone, people!

      Last weekend he bestowed me with a shiny pink dildo. Today I received a lilac epilator - hurrah! The lower half of my body will  never  be unhappy again.

      I am still a little bit out of it these days. I find myself unable to finish off sentences,  I have lost the smidgen of eloquence I never had , I laugh at jokes about four seconds late every time… so I decided that I should… read. Even at lunchtime I take my book. So my plan for today was to go have some sunshine in me (since I seemed to have lost the one I was born with) so that’s what I told the crew last night. But today I thought, fuck it, it’s gonna rain on me anyway, I rather stay home to read my book (surprise, surprise). But at about 3pm my bouncing ball of energy Jelte said let’s go to the beach (I am beginning to think that it is him who has stolen my verve away...). Anyway he asked if I could edit his  Skype   piece before we went to the beach. Of course I said yes but I can’t go to the beach, my toenails need to be painted. So he offered to paint them whilst I edit. Can’t say no to that. Besides, the gang called to say they were on their way to Sentosa.   So he had a poo then he armed himself with Cora’s pedicure stuff. I don’t know where or when he learned how to cut, scrape, push, file and buff (like he knows the evolution theory, how to make a wicked creamy pasta and the words to the philosopher’s song) but  my toes look happy now . He even painted a smiley face on my skin, on top of my right foot :o). The shade of brown he picked is lovely too. I enjoyed placing my feet on his crotch. My first ever pedicure! What a sweetheart I got. I love him to death! My baby! This morning he went to work without me because I refused to leave the bed.  My alarm clock has been doing odd things lately.  It first went off at 3.45am and then it went of at  4.62am!!  Weird, weird, weird. Arrived work at 11am. Was famished so I bought fried noodles with egg, veggie fritters and iced coffee to my desk. I am so full and fat now.   And I miss him :(  Anyway yesterday, after Sentosa (where I didn’t even change into my bikini that I had underneath my clothes... because I was reading…) we freshened up at Shazam’s then buggered to  Coyote Ugly . The dancers were really so good, it was bad! That place is full of American sailors and dripping with sexual desperation. Alcohol was consumed in er, creative ways. We were promised hard-bodied male dancers as it was also ladies night but all we got were skinny Malay boys who danced like geckos. We had free plonk the whole time there and I had to meet with some people, the 50-something Singapore expat wives Calendar Girls to be exact so I did. I even got one of their calendars. One of them owns this godforsaken place. After about 45 minutes, we left for  Peter Kruder at Velvet Underground .  I managed to get six of us into Velvet with no problems. Dickhead were with us though Bobo and June did not. Kruder was pretty good, the first time I heard his music was the day before. But Jelte and I stayed till after 1. Dickhead at first wanted to go but he went back to my friends and stayed till 2. Today I heard from Yvonne that the crew stayed till close. They walked to Shazam’s and they were so drunk by then. Haha, along the way,  Sandra ate some leaves  and at one point they tried to steal a table from six bouncers eating supper downstairs from Shazam’s place. Everyone was all over the place en route to Kellock Road. Yvonne was going to order some food to take upstairs and woo hoo! – she saw  Kruder eating chicken rice at Boon Tong Kee ! She is now one happy bugger with autographed CDs. They didn’t leave Shazam’s till 6am!  Blimey!

      In my excitement to start putting entries in this blog, I have failed to give thanks to certain people. Inundated with my frenzied short text messages and daily emails about my life, it was Jelte who first planted the seed of my own blog in my head, Loobz who spurred me on and Bobo my Lilies flowers who made the creations in my head look how they do here. She had painstakingly transferred text from my ugly old mblog blog to this current snazzy one, complete with images of mine I never knew she had. And it’s very nice to log in with entries to see she has made some changes every so often. Thanks chick! You are my bomb.    ..as refered to the above-captioned..   urlLink

      [Today’s soundtrack: Jack Johnson’s Mudfootball, “Everything good always would, everything good, always would remain”]  I am a paranoid peanut and I know it. That’s why I give myself two days before my insecurities drive me to question other people’s (usually good) intentions. That’s my mantra – Two Days. When I feel bad, mad or glad, two days are what it needs to be sure that I am not just being overtly emotional, that things are indeed, the way I see them. I urge you all, my devoted readers, to follow this mantra of mine. Never jump into conclusion, two days, two days…  it’s enough time for a little soul searchin’. Long enough to settle down wired nerves, short enough to sort things out (if you were right in the first place) before things get out of hand.   So. Sunday was kind of bleak for me and I have a very unreasonable reason for it: we had a silly fight on Saturday so I decided on Sunday that my life is ruined forevermore. Monday was just being Monday i..e. it was the blues, my mother doesn’t love me, Jelte doesn’t (really) love me ( I stubbornly thought, even though he said we will start a joint savings account on Saturday for a sabbatical together in a year’s time), I am a bad writer. So when Eda invited me for after-5 beers, I agreed. I couldn’t have met up with him at Orchard on time anyway (because I am such a bad writer, I needed more time to finish my work. For yesterday at least).  I informed him so and later we met at The Blue Cow.   When he played pool with Hooker, I took the chance to chew on Eda’s ears about him. When I say ‘about him’, I was actually talking about me. Like why do I feel this or that way and can you please give me a tight slap. I didn’t give her many details, because I didn’t know myself what they were. Here eyes glazed over, because (now I realised) she knows me and she knows Jelte, so she knew I was the twat. But I convinced myself she was crying for me. But there I was bitching about him (and me), and he came over, once to pass me a hundred bucks because I am broke, and another just to kiss my shoulder.   Aaaah! Why can’t he leave me to bitch about him in peace!?  When we reached home, I ran upstairs. I couldn’t socialise, I wanted to read my Cave Bear book. I squealed upon entering our room because I saw a mini Pooh Bear holding a flower on my side of the bed from Cora. This morning with my ‘morning humour’ as he calls my a.m. grumpiness, he growled like a cat complete with clawing hand movements when I was cussing in the bathroom. He kissed and hugged this bad tempered bundle of imbalanced hormones.   I realised now, Two Days later, that if my mum doesn’t love me, Cora does. And he does love me - he pretended to be a cat when I was in a bad mood. And in the car, he passed me his card so I can take a grand to help pay out the credit card company.   What more can I ask for? What more does this paranoid bitch deserve to ask for? I know someone who deserves a big wet blowjob tonight! :o)

      The Double Ss – Sandra and Shazam – plus Shazam’s baby sis, Enosha, and my colleague, Eda, were treated with Jelte’s scrumptious, sinful steak sandwiches last night at our place (not the new size-of-a-dining-table one but his folk’s, a.k.a. The Castle).   Was to busy to tell my faithful, possible imaginary, readers that we saw I, Robot two evenings ago. And what about it? It was kinda good, but don’t expect to be blown away by ingenious ideology.   It was like a cross between A.I. where a robot kid, played by Haley Joel Osment (sp), did not turn out to be a ‘normal’ robot, and Men In Black. You know? Robots with hearts with some kick-ass action? Yes? No? Okay maybe I am bringing the two together because of the Will Smith constant but this is not about his awesome pecs, we are talking about A.I.s here. ‘David’, the character played by the angelic Haley, wasn’t supposed to want to win the love of his ‘mother’ yet he did. Love the tagline too: David is 11 years old. He weighs 60 pounds. He is 4 feet, 6 inches tall. He has brown hair. His love is real. But he is not.   With I, Robot it’s similar. When Sunny, what this sardine-can anomaly is called, was about to be robotically put down, he asked, “Will it hurt?”Aiyoh! How to kill him now? But since he is not supposed to be ‘alive’, how can he be ‘killed’?  Why I like the film, and why Jelts likes it too, is not because it’s enlightening, not because it provides us with answers or even questions that no one has asked before (all popular ingredients for fat box office profits).   We like it because this genre of film keeps the very real topic of science’s artificial intelligence fresh in our minds.   We might not leave the cinema feeling like it has changed our lives like what Eternal Sunshine did to my friends and I (pinch of salt here, please) – we were speechless (could be because we didn’t understand the Kaufman) (another pinch of salt here, I am trying to be funny).   But subconsciously, we are learning more and more about the facets of technology versus nature. Yeah sure, through watching Hollywood jing-bang, but at least the seed of questioning life/ science notion has been planted in our little heads.   Anyway Eda and I worked till 9pm last night. One of the best things in life is when you go home late at night from the office with a workmate only to be welcomed by the smells of steaks and onions baking in the kitchen. You find your friends and your partner cooking up a storm in there, in between or together with glugs of beers and sips of cocktails. Balancing hot pans with cigarettes dangling from the corner of their lips.   We sat down a few minutes later around the small table, attacking Jelte’s too-large sandwiches with both hands (and noses too, in the cases of the Sooriya siblings). Then we shared a (too small) tub of Ben & Jerry’s Superfudge New York ice cream in front of the projector screen, watching episode after episode of The Family Guy.   It was blissful!  Tired after a long day’s work and fat with his love and good food, I fainted in bed.   Naturally.

      Ever since we got that great little unit, my mind had indulged itself in mental interior decorating. I find it highly distracting when I am trying to summarise feature length copies on topics like wines and Australian trains for the rag’s website.   A typical thought process goes like this:   … and the two-carriage Savannahlander can accommodate up to 120 passengers on the three-night round trips into outback towns…   Should we clean the new house up or pack our stuff first?    … and such double-lengthers can take you across one end of Australia and down the other in two or three nights…   Maybe we can do both first – but I’ll need the help of Linda the Filipino…      … all you need is two bottles of wine and enough self-control to drink only one of them…    Oh, don’t know if she is still wants to work for me… the last time she asked for work, I was never home enough to render her services useful.    … facelift that Athens is going through right now is reported to only be complete a day before the Olympics on August 13…     We need shoe racks. We can keep them below the kitchen window, in the balcony area.   … the lavender bath for a good night’s sleep…     Is there space for toiletries in the shower? Maybe we need to hang some kind of an amenity rack just outside of it.    … moves to his own beats when it comes to drum ‘n’ bass…    Can’t wait to move in... but there’s still so much to do!   There you go.   A sneak peek into my world.   Ass if this Blog is not enough….

      I am - nope, make that, WE are - very unhappy with work. Not what I do - I love my job - but with someone in particular for making my life, and those around her, hell with a capital A!  Yes I know there is no A in Hell but it sounded nice.  At that time.  Anywyay I don't want to waste my time and yours bitching and moaning about this moaning bitch because I am going to put my big foot down and take the boss out for beers tomorrow so that we can solve the world's problems together.  For now, I will be doing more of *her* work so that we can all live in peace and harmony. Tonight, my babylove Jelts and me are going to watch I, Robot with Shazam, Sandra and Shazam's baby sister whose visiting from Sri Lanka.  Oh I donno if it's my period that is coming or whether it's because I stuffed myself with good food silly in Thailand but I have been chunky foor the past two days.   Time to do my workout with my baby tonight! Just us and Mr Pinky!  Aaaargh! I hate her  PS. Just received a pink pair of boy-leg panties with glittery heart in front. Sweet.

      Just got keys to our new (doll)house in Toa Payoh.   It's so tiny - I love it! It's got one bedroom, a kitchenette, loo + shower, living room. I think if my mom wasn't around just now, Jelts would be as excited as I :o).   It's very clean and newly-renovated too. And the neighbourhood is filled with food centres and shops. Thank God we are ten floors up; the hustle and bustle is not a problem.   But it's smaller than I thought. I don't know where Dickhead can keep his stuff. He'd have to keep his personal belongings in the living room! My stuff would probably over flow out of the bedroom. Maybe it's better that I let him have it. Rather than us getting into one another's hair.   Will have to discuss this with him.

      Things to do when you have got a weekend in Bangkok:    Day One   Get your shopping out of the way first  Take the BTS sky-train to Siam Square, MBK and Discovery Centre, all mega-malls with mega stalls. You can find cheap and cheerful things to buy and places to eat. You can even catch a movie or two. BTS: SIAM   Massage  Then pamper those tired muscles and feet at Healthland for only 350 Baht (about SGD$14) an hour. Get your concierge to make bookings for you because I have lost the contact details. TEL: (66) 02 637 888 3   Dinner  Book a bed at Bed Supperclub (Sukhumvit Soi. 11) in advance. Dress code: smart casual so no shorts or slippers for the men. Then go home to rest coz your waking up early tomorrow. BTS: NANA   Day Two   Chatuchak  Wake up early to go to this crazy market where they sell ‘everything’. Eat something here but be careful you can see what they are selling to you or else, just get some unpeeled fruit to eat.   Brunch  Drop your shopping off in the hotel and go for brunch at Kuppa (Sukhumvit Soi. 16 ‘sip hok’). Fabulous ambience, cheap food. TEL: (66) 02 663 880 6; BTS: ASOK   Free and Easy  After this, you are free to swim in the pool, paint your nails, get your hair done, do more shopping or go for a spa treatment . Remember to pack most of your stuff as you are leaving the next day (this is a 48-hour guide, remember?)   Dinner  Go anywhere you like    Party  Have a few cocktails back at Bed but at its very own disco or at the nearby Q Bar. Then go to Mystique, at Sukhumvit Soi. 31. Q Bar & Bed Supperclub's BTS: NANA  &nbsp;

      Rolled out of bed at about 11 and packed away. Our flight was at 2.40pm. Big John came round to bid us farewell (he's on the 7 o'clock flight).   We should have stayed longer. We'd only discovered the virtues of the BTS, we haven't &nbsp;done any shopping (except I bought a 10 baht cat figurine for Cora), and there were half a dozen large bottle of Heineken, instant noodles, juices, soybean milk and everything still left in the fridge!  We were tired though, we'd been drinking steadily for many hours everyday and sleeping late since Weds. We had some bahts left so we pigged out on fast food. All that talk we had about the film Supersize Me had at last reversed our brains. Or was it alcohloic poisoning that has killed our brain cells?   Cora met us at the airport where we bought more alcohol- vodka and tequila and beers. Came back home, had a shower, unpacked, had dinner, and crashed! I snored so loudly, I woke myself up!   &nbsp;

      What a state the suite was in today. There were food everywhere! Big John came knocking while I was cleaning up, ready for some more food. The Two Ss were too tired to go and we agreed that Shazam deserved to chill for a little bit, so Jelts, BJ and I went lookin' for 'Kuppa'.   It was at Sukhumvit Soi. 16 and the cabby - classically - dropped us off way too far away from it to dare call himself a cabby. We had to walk back about 20 minutes before we found the place.   And what a place Kuppa is! It's a nice standalone cafe with a high-ceiling and open concept kitchen. And the food and coffees were divine! Real pastas, sandwiches and coffee. Nice ambience and very affordable. Each well-prepared dish was about $6-$8, a fraction of the price if it were to be Singers.   We packed some lunch for the lovebirds at the hotel and took the BTS (Bangkok's 'MRT') five minutes' walk away. It was Asok Station, and we took it back to the hotel, stopping at Ratchatewi Station, which was practically at its doorstep. It was only two stops away; it was about the same price as the taxi in 1/4 of the time. Fantastic. From then on, we kept taking the BTS.  All these while, Shazam got something in his bag that makes me go crazy. It's the tablet version of Clarinase syrup that I've got sitting on my office desk. I was royally annoyed with my stupid sinus when he finally realised to offer me one. Good thing he rested, now he was thinking clearly. After that, it was as if I had ten cups of espresso. I was bouncing off the wall. Parents: Keep Clarinase away from your kids and have them yourselves instead! Ha, ha... ha, ha!  After a rest, we decided to take a walk in the nearby malls: Siam Square, MBK, Discovery etc. It was so very crowded and there were so many shops! We even bumped into Chrissy who had just stepped out of Toni & Guy. We were to meet up at 8pm for dinner at Bed before partying at Mystique (hoping against hope this time round to bump into more 'friends').  Met Chrissy again but at Nana Station, near Sukhumvit Soi 11 where Bed (as well as Q Bar is). Dinner was fabulous! It was a set dinner thing where everybody was first asked for their dietary prefrences/ requirements. Then dinner, almost exactly the same for everyone, was served.   Starters were firstly, a very delicate and flavourful corn and crab meat 'cappucino' soup. It was a dream to have in your mouth! Then, we were served salad which was topped with what I believe to be basil and mint sorbet. What a delightful combination!   Before the (duck) main course which was served on a bed of what tasted like mashed sweet potato and pumkin, they did a re-enactemnt of Yoko Ono's piece-cut performance.   A 'geisha' walked slowly before finally settling on the stage right in the middle of the room. Then she placed a pair of scissors in front of her. Now, everyone was invited to come on stage to cut a piece of her black satin 'kimono'. Some cut out small pieces on her skirt whilst others cut the rest of her garment off (yep, a young man did that. How rude!).   Jelte cut a piece for me from one of her sleeves.   The whole set-up of the place was obviously, like a big bedroom. Unfortunately we booked just one night ago, so we had a table -  a table!  - and no bed in Bed. But after dessert we quickly took over someone else's 'bed' when they left. It was about 2,200 Baht per person (SGD$90), our one big meal in Bangkok which had to be done.   After that, we went to Mystique again. I pulled up my stunt to get in for free this time round, and it worked! The seven of us didn't have to pay to get in. We also had a table. I managed to convince them to invest in a bottle of vodka and I had fun! Jelte had ran out of steam by now and the rest were just bopping/ coping. Thinking about it now, I should have dropped Clarinase in their drinks. Hee hee.  I went out to look for Eric but I had to return soon enough to our table because I kept getting picked up. I was thrown the classic 'My name is Francesco/ Romeo, I am the director/ photographer&nbsp;of a modeling agency from Milan' lines, though this time it was for real.&nbsp;Their models were at the table right next to ours.   Again, it was a great night out which could have been better if blah blah blah, but I am glad we didn't as we had a plane to catch tomorrow and I want to look human when we board it.   Staying up too late and having baggages under our eyes are not good looks.   We went back to that coffeeshop below Chrissy's to eat again. I was drunk, as planned, and crashed.   Sad to know that we are leaving tomorrow :o(.

       Got up at 11 armed with the plan to hit Khao San Road for curry and orange juice. My nose was still leaking from being sick a week ago! I believe that it's because when Cora went away, we never bothered to squeeze our own OJs in the mornings. So I am Vit C-deficient.   Shazam was hungover. Again. We had not seen him sober for a while by now. But we continued drinking. Got a call from Big John at lunch. He had touched down and was going to meet us on K S Rd.   Went to Gulliver's Inn to cool down and shoot some pool. Bangkok is very hot. A while later BJ arrived.   Now that we had been in Bangers for more than 12 hours, we were desperate to meet Eric.&nbsp;A couple of phone calls already and he was nowhere to be found. Even Chaplin was out of town. Damn, it wa going to be a quiet weekend. We all knew it in our hearts, but we still hoped. In fact, for the entire trip, we were to spend a good number of hours chatting up strangers, making overseas phone calls for leads to both or either of them.   Luckless in that department, we went to seek solace in a place Jelts and I like: Hole in the Wall. Gulliver's was getting packed by then (about 5pm) anyway. Shot more games of pool and we also had shooters. If we were not gonna get high, at least we can get drunk, our insensibilities reasoned.  By 6pm, Reggae Bar was supposed to open. It did not. So we ordered beers at the bar beside it. That bar was more like a shop-front that sells beers. Across from it was a silver shop. Great, I can buy some accesories, I thought. But we went inside to find that they were all body-piercing stuff. I only had my ears pierced.   What the hell. I asked where to pierce my navel. They said few doors down so I went to look for it. I found the shop and I even selected a belly button ring - purple daisy with a large diamond type accent on it. Girly and fun.&nbsp;I asked how much. He said 500 Baht.   I went out looking for Jelte who was looking for me. I told him what I wanted to do. Of course he didn't believe me. I am the girl who gets hysterical when someone  else  touches  her own  belly button.   Maybe it was the Chang, maybe it was the shooters. Maybe my brain had gone for a walkabout at that time but I knew that it was the classic 'now or never' moment. Either I pierced my belly button now, or I was going to have 'Now or Never' tattooed on my arm.  I chose the former. By the time the guy was marking my orifice with a marker (which made me laugh hysterically, as you might have guessed), Big John, Jelte and Shazam were there. Someone said to video it and so Shazam did.    The video will tell about it all better than I ever could. I would post the clip up here as soon as I know how to.    It was to be the most rebellious thing I did for all the time I was in Bangkok, July 22-25, 2004. For now, let me just carry on talking about what happened the rest of the day.   We managed to meet Peter though, whom I don't like anyway. Went home after that to freshen up and mellow down. Chrissy, Boydie's wife, called and though she was up to her ears in work, she finally agreed to meet us up that night.   The boys and I went to the very-awful The Rock, across from our hotel, to wait for Sandra and Chrissy who turned up at the hotel around 8. First stop was Cafe Delmoc, near K S Rd.  Delmoc was hosting a drum n bass night. It was pretty pumpin' and that was where we (I) got pretty close to meeting Eric. But, alas, for reasons I shall not discuss here, where 40 people looked in my blog while I was away for 3 days looked, it was not to be.   So off we went to Mystique, the newest hottest club in Bangers.   I don't know how they did it but everywhere we looked, people we off their fucking trees. We were like kids in a candy store where they stored the candies where we could see them, but couldn't touch. This is all I am going to say about it.   At 3am and lollies-less, we went back to the hotel. But not before Big John, Jelts and I ta-paoed some great food like chicken and basil, crab curry and other goodies back from downstairs of Chrissy's place.   Apparently Shazam and Sandra got lost in their cab but at almost 4, we were reunited. After pigging out, we changed into our swimmies and erh, swam, It was so cold so we came back to our suite and wagged chins some more.   Bedtime: about 5am.   Our body clocks must have given up on us by now.  &nbsp;

      We over-estimated our mortal selves when we believed that Jelte and Sandra could be at work at the normal time after going to bed at 5am Thursday morning. At 8:30, a short discussion in the hallway resulted in them taking half days. So we traipsed back to bed. Then at 11:30, only Jelte was going to work while Sandra decided to stay at home after all. I went back home to pack.   In two hours' time, Shazam was on the plane with Hooker and his friend, Simon, to Bangers. In about eight, Jelte and I got into the plane for the first time together,&nbsp;also going to Bangers. Sandra would join us the following day.  We arrived at 00:15hrs Friday morning. The cabby took us to the 'wrong' Evergreen Place so we had to take another&nbsp;cab. Already we were late as the bars&nbsp;now close at two.&nbsp;By the time we met&nbsp;Shazam at our hotel, he was already 180 degrees (again) (Hooker and his friend Simon had booked themselves elsewhere).   The guy who checked us in was illiterate and incompetent. I wanted to check that he got my booking right: one room tonight, two rooms tomorrow. But he kept dodging my queries, he kept confusing things about. He was playing games with my feelings.   I was very patient because you should never make a Thai an enemy (trust me, my first boyfriend is Thai and we are still not on good terms, according to him)&nbsp;but usually-mild-mannered Shazam threw his passport at him.   I hid my horror, I was sure that the guard standing near us would shoot us with his AK47 and&nbsp;together, they would cut up our bodies into little pieces and&nbsp;sell them on the streets as barbecued chicken. I quickly explained to Mr Stupid that our friend here is very tired and very drunk. That's why we need our correct rooms quickly so we can chain him up inside, away from civilisation.   After about 20 minutes, we managed to drop our stuff in our room - which was fantastic, btw. It was&nbsp;quite big and clean. Everything worked and there was a microwave oven, toaster, fridge, cutleries, glasses.  Our initial plan to hit the clubs were exchanged with a more manageable in-room drinks courtesy of the nearby 7-11. I offered Stupid some drinks which he politely refused. But at least now we all know that we are all friends, not foes.  Went back up to our suite and now that we are settled down, we flicked on the TV. We were surfing the channels when at one point, we saw Stupid at the front desk. It was a camera surveilling the entrance so guests would see who was coming through! No wonder he rejected our Heineys. And if they shot us, one of the guests in his room was bound to have seen it all happen.   So we didn't got out the first night in Bangkok. We finally went to bed at about 4am.

      It had been quite a ride, this turning-26 business. I give up giving a blow-by-blow account so here is the sum-up.   Last Weds, after Blue Cow after-work drinks, we went to Thumper at Goodwood Park Hotel. It was the grand launch with pretty serious booze going on. Sweet. Yvonne organised a bottle of champagne for me and I must have had 17 birthday songs that night, and 17 more after-midnight. People were coming to me from all directions to wish me well.   Shazam was indeed suitably impressed with my Levi’s jeans stunt. He came round with Sandra about ten minutes after we arrived. Came to me with large bags and then pointed his finger accusingly, saying ‘where did you get that from?’. It was funny that he later said ‘wow, I can’t believe you pulled that joke. I feel so loved’. Ha, ha. I don’t know that you are supposed to feel that people care about you when they pulled a stunt on you.   With me were of course the posse made up of the Double Ss, Hooker, Big John, Boydie and Jelts. Office people like Jason, Hiroko, Eda, Shalini and Maria. Mann turned up with his wife, Maria. People like Anwar (Today paper), Merlitz and Ciaran etc were also there. Beside our table was Rick Tan’s, a gay actor, and his gay and/ or actor friends. You can imagine the racket coming from our direction.   Went to Ink after that. Even Jason who doesn’t drink nor party and who was working the next day came along. Actually everyone had to work the next day and they all lasted the whole night with me (who had taken off). Vernetta (Lopez) stumbled in at one point and we discovered that we share the same birthday.   So of course the birthday cocktails came around. Let’s just say it wasn’t me who did a Merlion all over the table top, completely filling up two or three once-empty glasses with her own projectile… she was entirely good-humored though. Besides everyone else was also sideways; there was not one person who did not empathise with her.   We were dejected when the lights at Ink finally came back on, signalling the end of our debauchery. It was after-3, and we were having so much fun. I was happy that it ended on a high note. Shazam and Sandra invited Jelte and I to stay over so we did. We stayed up till 5am at his, having our last cans of Sapporos and we just talked.  It was a seriously successful birthday celebrations. I guess it was because I didn’t expect anything much apart from a night of drinks with people who are close to me. The best part is I know that all my friends had fun! Even my sweetheart, by some miracle, did not get sick even once. Can’t wait to go to Bangkok for the weekend tomorrow…

      I am 26.    One and a half hours later    Um. Jeez… I have been walking around touching this and that, replying to people’s birthday greetings, been on the phone with Mum for half an hour, talked to Jelte on the phone, had a cigarette, sat down, stood up, looked in the mirror. Cooked pasta. So hungry. The last meal I ate was more than 24 hours ago with Bobo and Heidi, a picnic lunch on Jason’s rooftop.   This was what happened in my bubble in the last 24 hours.    At this point, kindly refresh your memory by referring to two posts ago entitled Happy Pseudo Birthday before reading on. But only if you think this might help in your enjoyment of my blog. If you don’t think so, then you don’t have to do it. In any case, to find out what happened to me in the last 24 hours, read on.    So when Loobz left my office, I went back to work. Oh, the rag went to bed yesterday – as planned. I can’t remember the last time we went to print on time. I now declare myself the new editor. I can do that because today’s my birthday and I am 26.    This is really hard to do right now, this typing my blog in. My thoughts together with my hand-eye coordination are not synchronising effectively. And my pasta is not going down too well either. Plus I kept thinking about which shoes to pack.    So there I was happily at my desk when I heard some familiar noise. I turned around and saw two pussycats standing and smiling at me. Bobo and Heidi came to surprise me. They had a bag (which looks awfully familiar but never mind) of makans and goodies. ‘Let’s go picnic’, Bobo said. My colleagues were milling about and they all told me that I am the stupidest person ever. Oh, no wonder I am stupid. I was the last person to know that my sister had planned a surprise lunch for me with my office peeps.   Jason tossed me his keys and we made our way to his house that is like five minutes walk away.    Fuck it’s 3pm. I have to finish this soon if I want to get anything epilated and packed. I’ll have another cigarette to aid in my erh, writing.    So we spread her Spiderman picnic mat on the floor of his rooftop and us three ladies shared a meal of egg mayo sandwiches, roasted chicken, chips, crackers and chocolates. The weather was nice and warm – not too hot – everything was chill. I was still not quite sure I deserve such a lovely surprise… and all her efforts, lugging a tot and two bags uptown to feed me. Aww…. I glow inside out just remembering Loobz coming to the office to give me the personal alarm (so I can bring it to Bangkok) and now, a concrete picnic my sis and niece.   After about an hour, we all piled into a cab and she dropped me off at work. Some time later, again I was at my desk when I heard silence behind me, at the back of the office. I went to investigate and I caught my colleagues by surprise as they were trying to surprise me with a birthday cake. It was funny seeing about 1,700 people huddling around the small glow of candles trying not to let me know that they were hiding my cake.   I grabbed my cam and snapped some pix of them and they gave up trying to hide anything. Now I got evidence you’d better give me my cake. So we all sang the happy birthday song. I popped my own bottle of champagne for the first time in my life.    Whoo-hoo! Dickhead just arrived to pass me my pressies. A g-string with a cow in front, a soccer design panty (don’t ask), a pair of shorts-knicker thingy and a PINK wallet. I will bring all to Bangkok later. I really have to hurry now so I can entertain him.    So it was a Wednesday afternoon and we were having a party at work. They gave me a Lulu Guinness bag! Wowwww.   Then Sandra called me to say that Shazam was going to give me my Levi’s today. Shoot. I was not wearing it so I have to go home to change into it. See, about a month ago after he said he wants me to have the Levi’s for my birthday, I kidnapped it from his home. It’s been sitting in my wardrobe, waiting for the time when he will give it to me and that should be when I am already wearing it.   So I went home to change. Finally decided what top and shoes matched my new Lulu bag and Levi’s. I know; very busy ah. Went back to the office and it was time to go for drinks. Eda was still having her hair washed at the salon downstairs so we waited for her at Cow.   At cow I was given some flaming bday cocktail and another bday song.    Are you tired of reading this already? I am already tired writing about it! Okay Cora had just came home from Holland. I think I better get away from this computer and talk with people. Don’t be a stranger! Will see you again when I come back from Bangkok on Sunday.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      1. I have a phobia about formal, sit-down dinners or gatherings  2. I only eat vegetables that are green – and I eat only the leaves  3. I can’t do anything else when I am on the phone 4. I don’t wear matching under garments (so troublesome lah?) 5. I am super short-sighted; over 1,000 degrees myopia in each eye (I     can’t see them anyway)

      Well since people are already giving me hugs, greetings and prezzies today, I might as well play along.   I am wearing my Tiffy ring today! My colleagues reckon that it’s different from the one that Hiroko has. She is the first person I know to wear it. Then Jason came to hug me and give me a gift – The Da Vinci Code. Fantastic! Something to read on the trip. As if I’d have the time to read anything ;o).   Then Loobz turned up with a small package with a small card. The card had (small) dried flowers on the front and inside, it held meaningful birthday wishes along the lines of ‘bla, bla, bla’ and ‘yadaa, yadaa’. Very touching.   The gift? A (small) personal alarm thingie! Now no unwelcome dog – man or animal – can get away with trying to rape or bite me! Jason laughed. He said as if anybody wanted to rape me. Yeah but I am more concerned about insane canine critters. My scariest experience was when Jelte and I were surrounded by mad dogs/ hyenas crossbreeds I believe in Ko Samet.   Anyway the alarm thingo has also got a flashlight so I can find my way around in this life. Thanks, Boobies! I really, really appreciate your coming all the way because you know I am going off tomorrow xxx!  Half of the office people are not in today. So it the day has a kinda sorta festive feel to it. We have a bottle of champers in the office to pop later. Maybe I will arrive Thumpers sideways.

      I have recovered from most of my boss’ crude words and my own crude snot depositing habits by now. I think he felt bad about it. Not about my flu, but for spitting the dummy at me last Friday. He invited me plus the rest who were in the orifice for beers yesterday. He also told me how his son’s new girlfriend didn’t believe I was “an 8-foot tall woman with huge tits” until she met me, which was also yesterday. As exaggerated his berate could be, so could his flattery – if you can call his description of me to her ‘flattery’ to begin with…    I am so excited about tomorrow and this whole week! So excited I cannot organise myself for Ferragamo at the Divine Wine Extraordinaire tonight. Fuck it. It’s formal wear anyway and I ain’t got those type of rags. I thought I could pull something off with my suede pants and a jacket but I don’t know why I dressed myself in a skirt and I am wearing sneakers instead.   Work wise, it’s still busy around here. We hope nothing goes wrong and that we can put the magazine to bed today. I have already started on our September issue. It’s gonna be another monster with our annual Spa feature plus a special 20-page British update.   I thought I couldn’t take the Thursday – my birthday – off, but it’s looking now as if I could. Which will be immense help because we are so gonna large it Wednesday night at Thumper – it’s free pist, my man, we just found out yesterday. First we got our mitts on invites now we are gonna party like it’s 22 July 1978 on the house!   We are flying to Bangers the next day. If I can get that day off, there are so many important things I could do. Firstly I could stay in bed till 12. I could pack our stuff (which will take me like what? 15 minutes with good music on). I could remove my body hair. I could repeat ‘Jelte is a sweet guy, he loves me so much, and I love him so much too, so I should stop being so mean to him just because I am a stressed cat’ in front of the mirror for one hour. After that I can sleep again.   Anyway we met with Shazam’s ‘ami’ last night. She cooked us full-on Sri Lankan dinner at his place. We pigged out on fried potato cubes with anchovies, chillies and onions. We dunk gobs of dhal or lentil curry on our food. We had second helpings of the tomato-curry chicken. Her basmati rice was divine! Light as air! It was like eating curried clouds. I had two rounds of everything and I mentally struck off my bikini from my list of things to pack for Bangkok. When Jelte massaged my feet on the couch, I surrendered. You guessed it – I hibernated with a 45-minutes sleep.   Jelts gonna be working a little late today so I’d better get some currency changed and if I can find one, a new top. I can also sit in a café and finish reading Mammoth Hunters – the third in the Earth Children series.   Aah… I have missed out on writing so much about the last couple of days. Some not so nice, some very nice. Very nice like going back home on Sunday and ate porridge that my sis Bobo cooked. We (me) bitched and moaned a little. We watched porn together (and I was horrified and I got nightmares about one particularly sick sick sick one!). I got my guitar back – it’s in serious need of tuning. Also about the day when boss screamed at me, the posse came down to meet Jelte and I at Dempsey Hut to cheer me up, whether they realised that I was miserable in the first place or not, I was very cheered up then what with Chaplin after that :o).   Well, this has taken me the course of one day to write. It’s getting too long so I’d better stop now.

      Yesterday I felt the worst I have felt in a long time. It wasn’t the machine-gun sneezing. Never mind that I was producing litres of freaking snot. It wasn’t the nasal congestion. And so what my head felt as big as Jupiter. It wasn’t the fact that my Jupiter of a head was blocked. What the hell, I still did my work.   It was because I left at lunchtime because I was so sick and my boss yelled at me. He yelled at me!? In front of the IT guy who’s got a funky body odour! Why didn’t he yell at HIM for smelling so bad?   I was so flabbergasted. I had been stressed out at work, juggling the work of three people. But today, when I know I can't keep my steam up and I had to go early, I made sure people could carry on with their work in my absence.   But when I am as sick as a dog, he spat the dummy at me.   You are so fucking welcome! Thank you for making my life miserable you C-U-Next-Tuesday!  There. But I still don’t feel better. In fucking fact, I am back in the office today, yessiree on a damn Saturday to – you guessed it – do more work.    I haven’t felt this forced, this immense tearing apart from the inside in a while now. The last time I was ever made to feel awfully like shit no matter what I did was when I was in my first relationship. And that lasted a good three-and-a-half years. I thought I am already over and done with my quota of letting people make me feel absolutely the shits.   So I met Jelte after being chased out of the office and you can ask him, I wasn’t a nice person to be around at all. I tried to suppress my unhappiness. But my mind was filled with worry and stress the whole time I was supposed to be getting better.   I was edgy and short-tempered. I was very, very unhappy. I wanted to go back to the office so many times. I struggled with myself. Didn’t I leave the office in good condition? If I went back, it’s as if I was not that sick. Wouldn’t I be demonstrating that I didn’t really have to leave in the first place?  In the end and after a few phone calls to office comrades, I didn’t go back. To show him how fucking dedicated I am, I came back today. To do what? The fucking content page which I had already done, with only the page numbers to be filled in.   Another thing I want to get off my (stuffy) chest is: why do men always say that women nag? Case in point, on weekends, we’d do the housework. Since I am in this godforsaken office now, I reminded him about the laundry he was doing. I had already swept the kitchen floor, cleaned the stove and washed the kwali before coming here. Now he said that I was getting good at nagging.   But I am not upset with him because it may be true. But isn’t there is a reason for everything? (I still don’t think my boss had a good reason for yelling at me though). I may have nagged because he may have forgotten to do certain things. It is a type of reminder that is used more often in dealing with unpleasurable things. But say, I keep badgering to give him a blow-job. Would I still be doing the action of nagging?   Actually, I might still be. If I don’t give a good head then my victim would consider that as harassment. This would mean that, that…. I have entirely derailed my train of thoughts. I have forgotten the whole wonderful point that I had in my head.   Oh well. My happy thought for today is going back home to pick up my guitar.   With what I am going through now (complete and utter confusion?), I may come out with some pretty good stuff this weekend.

      I think I am gonna be sick. Got caught in the rain yesterday morn and have been sneezing fantastically. Last night I dreamt that I have the fever and I woke up thirsty as hell. Jelts ran down to get me water and when I woke up this morning, I was under the weather. So weak.  We argued all night yesterday about the virtues of him giving the ring to me now (me) and how much more exciting it would be if I got it when I least expected it (him). Basically he ain’t gonna give me my ring now. I have to wait for my birthday and even then, he wouldn't tell me when.   So after dinner with his dad and their friend/ colleague, Twan, I decided to sulk. They were talking shop and discussing hierarchies during dinner anyway so that kind of tired me out. Besides I believed we stole a taxi from someone else who was by the road first and I felt bad about it. So I went upstairs as soon as we reached home to contemplate the order of things in the grand scheme of life under the shower.  When I came out of the shower, I saw Fondue my pet mouse wearing my ring on his arm! He gave me the ring! So happy… I squealed and ran downstairs to tell him how right he is – I didn’t expect it and I was very happy. Asked him to come upstairs with me so I can ‘thank’ him properly. He had to finish something on the computer so I went up first.   I waited in bed but I was out like a light in under five minutes.   So useless of me.   Oh well. He can wait :o).

      It will be interesting to read (and write) my blog in a couple of weeks. It's been rather angsty recently – because of work – and I hope that angst is not something closely associated with this blog.   I like to think that I have left my adolescence well and good behind.  I had a bad day – actually make that ‘weeks’. Days when upon going home, you still feel as shit as you do at 3.30pm when it’s after lunch and you are sleepy yet it’s still at least two hours away before you can leave the bloody orifice.   At first I tried to ignore it. I still went out, I met with people, I stayed up late. But I am tired. When I read my own blog, I see a lot of complaints from myself. Like this one.   This has to stop.   Well. I absolutely need to find the time to remove this ghastly fire engine red varnish I accidentally put on my toenails. In my tired mind, they were dark violet or brown.   Jelts and I went to watch  urlLink Supersize Me  just now.   Now I want to sleep.

      Have you ever gone through days (or a lifetime) being inexplicably stupid?   I feel like the perennial dumb blonde today (I had to check whether ‘perennial’ means what I want it to mean) (it does).   I feel like I don’t write well enuogh, I don’t sub (edit) well enough (I missed out a couple of fucking stupid typos) and once I had to striggle to come out with the answer of what 51 minus 4 is!  Look I even spelled ‘struggle’ ‘ striggle’.  Don’t laugh at me about being dumb – the joke’s only funny if it ain’t true.   What?   Aaaargh!!  I can’t write, can’t count, can’t organise my freaking birthday party.  I QUIT FROM BEING LIANA!!!!

      I quit! Both my job as well as being my own PR entity.   I said I want to quit work because this is what I do on a daily basis. Don’t ask.  And about quitting Banana Unlimited, yesterday I sent a poll out asking my birthday party guests if they can make it next Weds at a certain time. I didn’t say what it was for – to watch a film at the Gold Class cinema, actually – but the results of my little research say that I gotta cancel it. Six-thirty in the evening is apparently too early. And there are far too many constrictions like me not being able to choose what show etc. Hereby I quote Jelte: Bugger.

      I want my ring. I want it now. But I can’t have it now. Have to wait nine more days. Aaargh! The mental torture.   In the end Jelte and I did not watch Supersize Me after work. I fixed his dad and him mushroomy pasta and then I ate crabs by myself. Joris bought me two crabs. I guess that's his way to say "let's be friends". I didn't realise we weren't but since I was teleported to crustacean heaven, I guess we are friends forever now.   Back on earth I was attacked by a cockroach in the bathroom. Luckily I had some pandan leaves in my hand - I actually went in there to leave some on the floor as the critters hate the scent - but one cheeky bugger beat me to it. But the pandan leaves worked. I threw the bunch at it and ran like hell.   It's now buried in dust after Jelte hoovered it.   Patrecia swung by the office today to pass me July’s Juice magazine cause Jelte is their 'dude of the month'. My dude is Da Dude in my birthday issue. So clever. How did he do that? I think he is going to win hair gel hamper. But he is secretly wishing for a million dollars.  For accommodation in Bangers, my colleague Shalu recommended a serviced apartment called  urlLink Evergreen Place . It will be self-contained plus it costs only a portion of the price if we compared with The Four Seasons or Conrad - yes my friends actually planned for us to luxe it. I am happy to be at Khao San Road but I don't think they believe me just because  they  don't want to. Even though I told them that I have stayed there before, they still tried to educate me about the vileness of the place by showing me pictures. They (Hooker) even tried to scare me with a picture of a white guy at Khao San Road with dreadlocks and red pants ha, ha!    Anyway since one said that he rather sleep in his own vomit (profound insight by Hooker), the general consensus is now 'Ever Keen for Evergreen', catchy line courtesy of Big John. It's actually not bad at all. It's near malls, clubs and the Skytrain, it will cost us at most $50 each and there is a pool. Besides the Conrad will be full; booked out by the 15th Annual AIDS Convention space cadets.

      I swear my colleagues were more excited than me when I told them that I can’t join them for tea time fried rice because I had to fit into rings after work. Everyone (actually just the two of them) got worked up and said things like how he should have surprised me, how he should have taken them instead to Tiffany's so they can help him pick. I could almost hear them make decisions in their heads about what to wear to the wedding.  The problem about it is this was actually for my birthday. They knew (as with, you lot) that I have been hankering for that Tiffany mesh ring. Because we don’t want me to end up with more sex toys and hair remover gadgets (my family reads this blog), I went along with him.   So yey!!! I finally got it! But he said I couldn’t have it until my birthday. Thanks baby, I will cherish it forever plus seventeen :o). Our table number at Takashimaya foodcourt (like what else can you afford after that) was “17”.

      So I have got a grand total of one complaint today for not updating my blog. Been unable to write much last couple of days. Yes I know. The Sotally Tober update was not only unintelligent, it showed me and my friends in unstable state of minds. And that is not fair judgment on us. Anywya they were outdated. Not my friends but those pictures. But they are real; there was no deceit involved. I am not sure what I am trying to say but it IS almost 2am on a Saturday night and I have just come home from Heineken music’s Area320 event. So this is for you – Good Root Addicts.   I have always wanted to say that.   Anyway Area320was GREAT. Like I said, we left at 1 so there weren’t much to be seen in terms of people but there were firestarters. Don’t know if they are considered people. I tired my hands twirling and spinning glo sticks on strings and I hit my head twice. Needless to say I did not quit my day job.   The musicians – we were right up front of the stage –  were fab. I had a good time even if the rest of the world were zombified. Perhaps it was me who was odd but as you klnow, I dont realluy care. I appreciated the effort that some people go through to have, though sometimes outdated, ‘live’ music. They are good. They musos were mad. The guy at the synthesizers was so into his music, he reminded me of Slash but with keyboards. Hair all over the keyboard. 141 Worldwide not only let me in on media passes, I got three minute tickets for my mates too with little grovelling. Maybe they didn’t have enough people in the party but who cares? The beer was $6 each so we saved money for like 5 beers. One track mind  I am going to bed now because I realise I am making worse sense than normal.   Good night world.

      Jelte already mentioned in his blog about the b!tch. To update from there, no, we were not at that event that the c*nt mentioned – fancy spinning tall tales like that. My reputation is at the stake that her body will go through soon enough. Muaaarghh... ha ha... haha... !

      I have taken over the editorial side of things. So naturally, when my hair got on my nerves this morning, it was dirty, shapeless and in need of a trim, I had to book an appointment at the salon across the street.   Back to work, I am seriously shovelling. Liasing with a thousand people about issues of August to December. Sarah left vague instructions to all as she was in a great hurry and they have been calling, e-mailing, and coming to the office to sort things out with me. Fucking hell, I was so stressed out busy I had to take a Lexotan to slow down my heart rate.   So my day is indescribable because hey, didn’t I go to the hair salon during office hours? But people don’t realise that it’s because I am too busy to fucking even wash my hair. After showing my face at potential advertisers, Breitling, event at IndoChine, I have a fashion show to go to tonight. I cannot afford to look like what the cat dragged in. Yes it sounds glam and all, and it is, but they are both also work. I have to be at the fashion show to make nice to a Japanese fashion mogul Mr Shiirashi with Hiroko my colleague. What is really nice for me though is that they allow me to invite my friends. So no wonder people think that I am actually not busy and stressed out.   Please, please open your mind. Look beyond the pink bag and hairdryer-blown hair. I got to go places to be places. And who says champagne doesn’t help, especially with my friends with me? (remember my earlier blog about me being socially inept sometimes.. believe it or not).  Sigh.   PS. Heineken gave me two passes for their event this Saturday and guess what? I just won two more via email!!

      I bought six ships last night.  I got myself THREE pairs of shoes, hurray hurray. Now I have a pair of red ballet flats to go with my Levi’s jeans that Shazam still does not know he has given to me (I stole my pressie from his room, remember, O loyal readers). Now all I need is a funky top (and today I realised that I do not have a black bag)… for my ‘birthday suit’. Anyway I spent $200+ last night on that red flats, a bronze strappy heel and a fucking kuniang beige slippers with kitten heels; got ribbon in front some more! Hahaha… I have to buy them because it’s near impossible to find protective gear for my soles. Yes, I have extremely humungous feet – size 12 or 42 if you need a laugh – and buying shoes for me has all my life been a big deal. Yep, pun intended.   My toes have always been subjects of attention. Women get stared at all the time be it because of their boobies, asses or faces. For my case my southern digits get all the fixated gazes, often with passing glimpses of fear. I think people get scared of things they don’t recognise. My toes are long and gnarled, to suit the rest of me.  When I wear covered shoes, which is often because I hate scaring people unwittingly, they still show beneath the leather or the canvas. It’s as if I keep mice inside my shoes. They look so bumpy. When I was young, about seven, I used to entertain fantasies about chopping them off with a parang. I believed I wouldn’t bleed because they are so dried-up and bony – it’d be like crushing dried twigs. So I hate my toes.

      So my Fujifilm digicam is still spoilt rotten even after sending it for repairs twice since April. It even became worse – now the battery won’t respond to being charged so I guess they killed my battery. I decided to take matters into my own hands and dialled them up. I told the receptionist that I wanted to complain. She said okay so I complained about what I just said in the beginning of this rant. She then got me to speak with the engineer and  so I repeated my complaining to him. The poor guy apologised and said they will give me a new camera. I started complaining about how the images in my memory card... what? They were gonna give me a new Fujifil Finepix 402 digital camera!? Who said Singaporeans don't know nothing about service? Yay! I am going right after my editorial meeting at SODs. I am gonna have a cheeseburger with fries and salad (must eat salad and quit smoking or else I get breast and cervix cancer – tell you more about it later – just some kind of online cancer test Jelte got me to do).   My editor is leaving for the UK tonight for three weeks, egad! My Bangkok birthday holiday is happening just in time. I will be quite a wreck holding the fort at this orifice with only Karen helping out on a part-time basis. Actually I don't think I can do it. Actually, I think I  might quit when Sarah is away!   After three days in Bangkok, I will come back and rest from my holiday for two days before going back to the grind again. Maybe I can beg Chris to give me some Earth Sanctuary spa vouchers. Eek! Forgot! Forgot to ask Chris about GoldenVillage!  Time to go write Spa feature.   Time: 2.45pm. I am a little bit drunk from our editorial meeting. i am going to be super busy , busier than i thought id be form now on. goodbye freedom.

      It was my birthday and the night before Jelte & I were out celebrating. So we were both quite tired, the party has started and my friends and family were there. But he didn’t show up for my birthday party. He was elusive and unreachable. No one knows where he was. I saw glimpses of him but he never stayed to talk. We went to Tiffany’s and he didn’t really want to be there buying me a ring (I don’t blame him… he he). He didn’t say much; his head is always down and I felt like he was looking for ways to leave me. I was confused, I was at a loss. He refused to talk to me, refused to answer my questions. I was almost begging. I didn’t want the ring anymore; I didn’t like all of this anymore. So I picked the ugliest, the cheapest ring – it was spiral and looked like a normal key ring. Back at the party, Shazam rang me. He was having fun with a girl from upstairs he just met. He was in the toilet. He said ‘this will sound crass, you won’t like it.’ I said tell me please, Jelte been behaving awfully odd! He said Jelte wanted me to know that he has left me. Aargh! I cried and I cried. I threw away the blue Tiffany box and the fucking key chain ring!   I felt like dying! I woke up and Jelte was there beside me and I begged him not to leave me like that! Not on my birthday! Cannot, cannot…   [end of fucking nightmare]  I slept for a grand total of 25 hours this weekend. Last night from 8pm-8am today. The nightmare must be because I slept on a super full stomach. We went to have beers with Joris and then seafood. I ate and I ate. Thai fried chicken, garlic prawns, beef with spring onions, omelete with chicken char siew and shrimps, rice. I couldn’t stop and when we reached home, I had to lie down. I ‘lied down’ till today morning.  And my tummy hurts! Felt like a rock. I think the food is still indigested, all rotting in my stomach. I feel so disgusted. I will drink Yakult later, when I can find one.

      We slept from 9pm last night to 10am today! Suitably rested, felt like doing something special but it’s 3.30pm now and we are still at home. He fixed us breakfast and I made lunch of 'mee siam' pasta with tuna. Then I broke the second glass this week today. I thought I have grown out of my klutziness. Oh, just remembered now that I have to write my Top Three column by today! Bye.   PS. I have long since wondered, after having tasted almost all Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavours available in this country, what my fave Ben & Jerry's is. You gotta like all of them, it's so hard to pick JUST THE ONE. But today, at last I found out. My discerning taste in ice cream has at last deliberated enough to come out with one single preference - my favourite BJ ice cream is New York Superfudge Chunk!

      We went home at 6.30am this morning. Washed up and slept (fitfully) till 11am. Came downstairs for a cuppa before heading to Tanjong Pagar to pick up Cora’s namecards, and then to Kallang McDonald’s for Heidi’s birthday with her parents’ friends and our relatives, including my  urlLink two sisters ! Too bad the 4th sis is in Perth :(.   The party, though kiddy, wasn’t so bad. All of us like a bit of fast food every so often. Heidi looked really pretty in her blue fairy outfit and Lilies added the fairytale touch of blue glitter onto her eyelids. Kids and the not-so-young ones joined in the game of stacking up paper cups. When it was time to cut the cake, I was also called into the picture and guess what!? They had a cake for me too –  urlLink a chocolate star cake !   I was a little embarrassed to be stealing Heidi’s thunder... look at us  urlLink Aunty & Niece ... but I still am so touched – thanks Mummy, Bug, Bobo, Wang, Loobz, Dickhead and me Jelte.   Even though J & I were a little out of it, it was fun for us. Even with little people trotting about. We were a little thirsty though and so after that we went to Da Cow. After a few cooling ambers, we headed home. Had a nap, had dinner, saw Cora off as she left for the airport to go to Holland, and went to bed right after at 9pm.

      Yes I know this is a real awful title! But it’s Friday and I don’t give a cat’s left hind paw!  As you can see, my beautiful geeky sister, Bobo, has put up images from last night’s birthday dinner. And if you read my blog from yesterday as you should, you will also know that we were indeed at Monkey’s.   Anyway moving on, did I tell you that Jelts had his hair cut? Now we can see his face again – he really does have one. It looks very good too but don’t tell him that or he will not talk to you for 5 minutes.  The posse is supposed to hook up today – ironically without Hooker himself – for seafood at ‘No Signboard’. But I don’t know. Seems like Thumper could be a very real option as well. But all I really want, all I really, really want is to go to the Blue Cow and play pool and beat people like Jason and Jelte at it.   Ha,ha.. ha, ha… I am so shameless. I am feeling mad today. Sometimes the idea of a party is more fun than the actual party. I don’t know yet if we are going to party tonight but if I keep feeling like this all night without it actually happening, it’s good enough for me.   Some updates that I have forgotten to update you with: / I haven’t tried the epilator again but will do this weekend, together with dyeing my hair blonde / If my hair turns out awful – both down there and up here – I will dye it totally black. The top one, not the bottom one. The bottom one not supposed to have anything to dye ;) / Hadiko, our French neighbour’s French cat, now thinks that our house is his. He eats and sleeps there. I think he only goes to his own home to have a crap at. He is learning how to speak Dutch. He is exactly like me except that I don’t use the house to only crap at / We haven’t gone to Batam or Pangkor as planned but we are going to Bangkok for my birthday! / There is also an eve-of-birthday party and the e-vite’s already been designed by me / Pangkor Breakaway Party that was cancelled is now happening again Jul 30-Aug 1. I may or may not go – depending on how skint I am post-Bangers   Have a good weekend to all xox

      It’s my niece’s 4th birdthay today:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY PUMKIN!  Forgot to buy wrapping paper yesterday and today I got the prezzie slightly wet. It’s rainy season again. The family is having dinner tonight at – I suspect – Monkey’s. Goody, I feel like having the spicy Punggol Mee Goreng. I wonder if they have this noodle dish in Punggol itself.  I realise that there are no real birthday venue options for toddlers to tweenies. They are from the age when they are too young to have anything fancy but already understand the concept of ‘birthday party’; to too ‘old’ to have clowns but want to have a birthday party that classmates and friends will be impressed with.    For expatriates, they usually live in big houses, sometimes with swimming pools. Their kids have that extra option to have a customised party at home, daddy as clown negotiable.   Most locals live in pigeon holes called the HDB. By the Housing Development Board. Basically, cement and steel squatters. These residences were built with practicality first in mind, to ensure that everyone has a small roof over their heads. These small roofs cover small houses. Small houses cannot accommodate kids’ birthday parties – the littlies need places to run amok in.   Even worse is birthday parties for local Muslims like us (at least when we were younger and cannot have secret, ehr, ‘progressive’ Muslim parties). We want to go do something special, we go to Monkey’s Café, the only ‘halal’ restaurant in town. Funny, it’s located in the midst of discos, KTVs and bars. The four floors of whores is in the same building.   Heidi is lucky though. I wonder if she is a Generation Z. She gets to celebrate her birthday at McDonald’s. This Saturday, we have party there. Got Cowboy Charlie. Cowboy Charlie can make balloon sculptures. I want to ask for balloon flower.   Anyway, she is lucky because at the ripe old age of four, her guest list reads longer than my upcoming one. Yes, I have already made some ideas about what to do for my birthday and for those whom I know reads this Blog, you are invited too. Especially Patrecia coz she got the same birthday as mine.   So, Heidi is lucky also because, back when we were young and stupid, we can only wish about having our birthday at McD’s. ‘Halal’ foods weren’t the rage then and we only ate fish burgers. My, how Time has changed. The Generation Z is so lucky. Generation Xes like me, we had to make do or, even better, made things adapt to us (i.e. break the rules!!! Bring on the bourbon!). Generation Zs (I am still uncertain if she is a Z-er) get to have birthdays at both McD’s and Monkey’s.   I will be having a secret beer to toast to Heidi before dinner. My big and strong boyfriend will not be joining us for dinner because at dinner, my Mum will be there.   Thank you for the lovely surprises, auntie Liana!  urlLink     Monkey see, monkey hear & monkey presenting the balloon and cake.  urlLink     Happy birthday to you... croak.. croak..  urlLink

      We watched a shitty film just now. It is called The House of Flying Daggers and it's such a total piece of crap, I wish they allowed 'free list'ing so I could have very well used my free Golden Village tickets to buy the tickets for my friends and I instead of wasting good $34 (of Hooker's).  Even better, I should have bought a pirated VCD (ooooh! scandalous!), flick it on at home, and fall asleep on the sofa.  That'd have been much more enjoyable.  Zhang Ziyi is a nice piece of work but oh, the plot just kills me!  She belongs to a righteous tribe called the House of Flying Daggers who is against the wayward ways of the goverment. They tried putting a plot there - even a plot within a plot - by making her a blind girl who works in the whore house and who possesses exceptional gift in dancing.  A 'govt. official' got word that the daughter of the old leader of this govt-opposing is in this whore house so he went there to cause trouble so that she might get arrested by his people.  Anyways to cut a long boring sappy romantically-overloaded story short, she falls in love with her captor, and he, with her, and they try  to run away from all the bad people and she was hit by a - flying! - dagger of course where her heart is and then it snowed suddenly and then she died and then the two rivals in love fought and then the old lover almost killed the new lover and then she suddenly got up again from under the snow this time and tried to save her new lover from being killed by her old lover!  How annoying.  I am going to sleep now

      I have been 100% since Friday. It feels wunderful not having toilet rolls as my constant companions.  We partied pretty hard on Saturday. There were thousands of bare-bodied men in all shapes and er, bra sizes. I noticed that they have spent more time in the gym, more money on steroids. And they have practised to be submissive at the same time too. Pouty, feminine, soft. I feel pretty manly myself there. A lot of gay men came up to tell me I looked good and I was given a Military Ball dog-tag because I am that cool (?). Whatever that means.  Jason came and stayed over after the Military Ball at Suntec City. On Sunday, we just hung out, dicked around with the computers and I read a lot.  I have finished the trilogy of Clan of the Cave Bear and have started on the book that follows, Plains of Passage. This hard cover is the size of a mattress. It is hard to wield and it hurts my lap when I read in bed (I can't possibly bring it out with me to read on the trains in the mornings - it would be like opening up an umbrella in an elevator!).  So I am on to the Da Vinci Code now and it is mesmerising. There are some apparent facts in there that I'd like to read more about on my own. It's a history/ religion/ thriller and of course, the religious institution in question is Christianity.  A couple of years ago, I found out about the freemasons and some other top-ranking secret societies founded by the Europeans. The ang mo's secret societies are so different from our Ang Soon Tong, Sa La Kao (sp?) etc. Their influences reach all the way to royal bloodlines and the very existence of religion.  In the Da Vinci Code, the papacy (the Catholic church) is so powerful that history is rewritten in such a way that the world is as it is now. When women and feminity used to be revered in the beginning of time, when sex was sacred and the womb a sign of fertility and power; the Church had turned those on its head, the fear of men of women so self-engulfing; and so it made women the weaker sex, and that copulation is now the work of the devil, and it now became that a woman was the one who made that perennial mistake and succumbed to temptation by eating that apple in West of Nod (Nod is actually a cursed land, east of Eden)...  Then the three of us watched Man on Fire - that made me cry. It's well put together and the music well chosen. The cinematography is a little artsy, making its visuals interesting. The storyline is a tad predictable. But Denzel Washington has a new fan in me.  So Jason left us at about 1am Sunday night. I kept reading till two. Woke up at about noon. It's National Day today - happy birthday Singapore and happy 'being able to ' come out of the closets without being arrested, all you homosexuals! I am sure you - and us two, if we manage to drag ourselves out to Zouk's closing party tonight - will be having so much more fun now that Singers has loosen its collar on your sexual preferences and birthright. Again this has at least a slight political/ economical hindsight to it but hey, when is it ever not anymore? In this complicated, two-faced modern society?  Jelts made us some very delish chicken fried rice for lunch. Shit. He had now even beat me in making yummy Asian fried rice; this used to be my specialty but he hasn't tasted my beef rice yet.

      Jason, Jelts and I are now all seated in front of the PCs after a night out partying hard at Fridae's Military Ball 'Make Love Not War' party. Gay parties are always so fun!  Dickhead and his friends Bryan, Danill & Nadia just left the house too. He came to pick up Toa Payoh house keys. They wanted to watch DVD there. Jelts &amp; I just shifted all my things from Serangoon North today.  Last night, the Doubls Ss, Hooks, Jelts and me went to meet Leon/ Paul McConomy's friends from Hong Kong at Post bar. We drank so much! I bumped into the gay couple, Alan and Andrew at Suntec's party just now.  Can't think right noe. it's 6.30 in the morning!

      I think my  belly button might fall off. Here I am sitting down at my desk when I had this urge to say hello to it. Then I saw that where the piercing was done, it's close to the surface. So I can see the stem of my stud through my skin. it's like looking at my belly button bone or something.

       This is a warning.  Should any of you see a 5'4" Sri Lankan man with a chesire grin and who answers to 'Shazam', RUN.  He is known to make sick people go out.    [rewind to 12 hours ago]  I worked till 8pm last night and went to get Jelts from Shazam's after work. Shazam was going to meet Sandra, and her sis + brother-in-law later on, but we didn't want to go out.  I had been sniffling all day, using up a whole office-sized bog paper and turning my dustbin at work into a work of art called 'The Legacy of Dead Trees'. Washing my hair and then tucking myself into bed with a large bottle of water and my book after a long day's work sounds like heaven.  So Shazam wanted to drop us off at home before he goes to Attica to meet those people.  Bad idea.  He'd been trying to convince us to please join them. Something about him being lost in Frog-land.  But I already had images of me in Sleep-land.  I must admit that it didn't take much for me (since I was the sick one, I get to decide whether we succumb to the idea of socialising in cold places with loud music that serve alcohol) to tell Uncle Cabby to please wait for us at the house for five minutes while I change so we could all go to Clarke Quay.  Being sandwiched in the back of a taxi with these two men have the kind of effect that positive ions have on you. It's like you could do anything (I was wrong by the way).  So both Jelts and I changed out of our work wear and the rest, as they say, is shooters.  We want to Attica first then to the 1nitestand and Crazy Elephant before ending up at Liquidroom - it's been SO long! I'll tell you something funny; my nose stopped leaking somehow.  Was it because I was in my elements? A thought. Guess bright lights, friends and alcohol have the same effect on urbanites as greens, fresh air and birds chirping do on country dwellers.  Scary thought.  Anyway Chris is having people come to sanitize our air cons, carpet and phones coz the office had turned into a vicious cesspool of germs and viruses. I needed to get out of there and weird thing - when I left the office to work from home, I realised that I don't remember how I got to work.  Going home was a good idea.  Gotta get some work done now.

      This cold goes round and round, I tell you. I ain't the only person who got it again after recovering from an earlier one. Dammit - my nose is falling off my face. Aaaaaaaaah.  I had a good laugh by  myself just now coz I remembered what happened at home this morning.   I was fixing toasts and I asked him what he wanted on his. The bloke ignored me - think he was walking around the house, thinking - and I was getting irritated, what with trying to feed us and getting my nose to stop flowing.  I asked him again, I might have yelled  by this time, and I had to smile when he said "Toothpaste!"  Ha, ha... it's a little hard to be angry when someone said he wanted toootpaste on his toast.  Someone suggested that I put tampons up my nose. Grrr!

       I still have not figured out a way to put up my piercing vidoe clip up here.   I just fixed the worst dinner ever (after my granulated instant noodles - yes it was as gross as it sounds).  It was supposed to be spinach pasta in creamy mushroom sauce topped with sausages and onions (I was too lazy to thaw the chix).  But it turned out to be a green slimy monster.  Even the suasages were slippery. The whoel thing was just a big mess.  I wouldn't go near it but sweet, sweet Jelte ate it.  I had Nutella on toast for dinner.  Aaah... have to do some more work now. Have got the damn flu again too, the one I have just recovered from, and the same one my colleagues Hiroko and Shalu are at home because of.  Sarah my still editor - the publisher and her had a fight this morning...  and then they went for lunch!  - said I shouldn't take Clarinase, when I told her I might get some. She said Clarinase made her hearbeat race.  I told you before that it made me go loopy. But I got the fun symptom, she got the scary one. But we decided that perhaps people with anxiety attacks get weird symptoms.  So I thought okay, I will go get some Clarinase when I meet Patrecia at HV later. Alas, she was already home sick.  Everyone is sick.   We all got bird flu - leaky beaks, Big John said.

      Jelts played a game that made me sad and angry last night.   It wasn't the fact that he was playing a game, it was the animation of the game, that Anime, that reminded me of something. It didn't bother me at first, sitting beside him on another computer. But 10 minutes later, I kept glancing at the animation which was slowly being replaced with image flashbacks from my memory. Those images were joined by words and sounds and feelings, flooding my head with things I don't like.  I went upstairs to play the guitar (after so long... I didn't play very much). Ten mins later, he came looking for me. I read his blog today; I admire his unassuming personality. His ability to ignore the negative is one of his strengths. I just let lifeless computer animation ruin my feelings.   But of course, I want everything - I want to be able to forget yet I don't want to lie about my real (wussy) feelings.

      It's Loobz's bday last Sunday and we planned a surprise party + two day chalet for him.   Was supposed to meet the family for brekkie at 9.30am but we arrived at a time more suitable for lunch. Next up, we sent the bday boy up to a massage while the rest of us mere mortals split ourselves in two groups - boys and girls - for the BBQ shopping. Boys buy stuff like charcoals and girls buy stuff like fluffy white bread.  Went home and marinated and cooked and peeled, and we were on our way to the chalet at Loyang called Aloha. There are very nice, sprawling, clean holiday bungalows. But it's only meant for civil servants and governmenet officials. I wondered if we can throw a party here.   Dickhead was to somehow think of a way to bring Loobz here and he did, about two hours later. He called me on the phone saying, "Yah lor, my friend Ah-Boy got problem ah! I go Loyang first ah. Wah lau eh, kan ni nah si bei pwobwem ah!"  I scolded him on the phone. He was supposed to bring Loobz here, not save his friend from a gang fight in Loyang (he's a pseudo cop)! All upset, I told Bobo this. Her eyes lit up and she said "He's coming! Everyone, he's coming!"  I was confused then I remembered... 'gang fight' in 'LOYANG' - that's where WE are! I couldn't believe that I was SOOOOOOO...... distracted.  Ahem.  So the surprise really turned out well for him, you could see it in his eyes when he arrived, all ready for a showdown with some people to see us instead, of all people.   We ate a lot, I ate four times and we all drank. Mummy didn't scold us, she just said Loobz should drink slower as he turns red easily (!?).  We played street soccer and our team won 10-7.

      Going to bed at 7-something a.m. just makes you want to stay in bed forever.   So at 5.30pm, I woke up. Couldn't remain under the duvet like that - I've got spas to edit.   While Jelts spruced up the battleground of the previous debauchery, I drank milk and chain-smoked in front of the PC, working. At 8, we left for Shazam's. Met up the crew plus Sandra's sister, Celine, for the first time.   Dinner at Kiruya Dining was really good. I mean the food had always been so but where we sat, at this warehouse-looking smoking-enabled area, felt like we were somewhere else, not a shopping mall restaurant.   The plan was to boogie at INK after dinner but Jelts was feeling a little fragile. I didn't mind either way so I volunteered to take him home. As if I would have it any other way.  He's mine!  I get to take him back with me!  Finished Back to the Future 2 and I fell promptly asleep at  the beginning of number 3...

      Called Yvonne in the afternoon to tell her that I couldn’t go to her Cosmo party tonight. Been nursing an infected eye. I am now re-enacting my school years with my geeky look No. 1.  I was also too disorganised to dress up on that Friday.  I was in the office till 9pm. Met Jelts up at the cow for a gratifying ale after work and that quickly became like eight or nine (I actually tried to count). Shazam came through later. Eric was supposed to come at first at 7pm. Then it became 10.30pm, then at last we met him after midnight. By the time Sandra arrived afterwards, we decided to go home. By then we were suffering from alcoholic/ toxic poisoning. Off our postal codes. Big John and Mann turned up at a later time. I joined Jelts in kissing the ceramic throne on more than one occasion. We had guests till around 7am.  Blasting night.
