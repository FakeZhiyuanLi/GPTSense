      Anyone who knows knows me well will also know of my never-ending stomach issues...my middle name is heartburn (well not really because let's face it, that would be weird)...last night I ate some french cuisine which brought with it, you guessed it, a flaming esophagus....now, I had always swore that I would never take Rolaids...chewing up chalky pills....no thank you....but last night I was on my deathbed...so I searched through my 10 junk drawers and found half a roll of old dirty Rolaids...I chewed em up...and guess what...cured...thank you Rolaids....  ...and that was the account of a Friday night in my life....pleeease reopen Chestnut...I swear, I'll never say I'm too old for you ever again....speaking of....I decided during a conversation with Gep last night that going to the Chestnut for me back in the day was much like I was involved in the sport of Sumo wrestling: a lot of shoving with my ass hanging out...  Until next time...Peace out home slice

      I know...if i was this websites' mother you would report me to welfare for neglect...but gimme a break...it's been a busy week...countless beers have taken years off my life but seriously though, good times...  August 16, 2004...Here are my post-wedding thoughts:  1)I'll be honest...I used to think weddings were gross and scary....but this week has made me change my mind...I've upgraded "gross" to "yucky" and "scary" to "not so bad, I guess"... 2)best of luck to Pete and Mel...best of luck to me and Hugh Grant...I've loved you through 4 weddings..I've loved you through a funeral 3)Best of luck to my girlfriends and base Gagetown...."Be all you can be" 4)No matter how many beer you consume, Mark Abraham still looks wrong in a tight tank top (picture is available upon request)...sorry dude...no dice....nooo dice 5)Invite single women to a wedding and they go into heat 6)Vomiting is surprisingly less gross if everyone is doing it...but not even Kimp can make it sexy 7)We've finally reached the age where we're old enough to behave...gross...  Until next time...fuck y'all...

      Well i have come to realize that the worst feeling ever is when you go on an interview ...don't get a call back and then 2 weeks later they post a help wanted sign outside their store...I GET THE HINT! anyways the smart thing to do would be NOT  to tell them off ....but thats no fun...but after the snottiness and attitude..realization sets in and theres no possible way i could get the job now...oops!..and this is why i'm unemployed...it all comes together now...anycrap this is what i do during the day now....(and yes i know i talk about the cat alot...but it's my only friend right now) 1-wondering why my lease ends the 26th and i can't move into the new place till the 1st...sweet..you guys can reach me at 1111 refrigerator box kids, the side of the road. 2-why would my cat would sleep on the tower of my computer under my desk...here aer my theories...she wants to hide because she doesn't want anyone to see her having crazy cat sex fantasies, she's telepathically fixing all my viruses in my computer, and lastly..she's jsut a moron 3-All the lightbulbs are burning out in my apartment..should i fix this?...nah..we will let the sister think she's pretty for a while...hey what can i say...i'm jsut that kind of person

      Apologies for my lack of updates...it's certainly not because my life has been anything less than exciting lately....what have I been up to?.....what haven't I been up to.... :  1)Running Fredericton's newest flop house....I wake up each morning with a new person on my couch... 2)Buying gifts, wrapping paper, cards, etc. for the upcoming wedding...The amount of effort that goes into a wedding is insanity...if I ever get married it's Vegas Drive-Thru ceremony all the way... 3)Reuniting with people I haven't seen in a while...and with every new arrival I ask myself "What is gonna go wrong at this wedding??" 4)Trying to put time in at the office...after the "you're terminated" scare of late, my boss scares me 5)Trying to organize myself for the upcoming year....picking courses (yes I waited until now), setting up my new apartment, applying for loans (again, yes I waited until now)  Sorry for the extreme lame-o-ness of this post....I promise my sense of humour will return soon...until then...watch this:   urlLink http://www.rathergood.com/moon_song/

      Well since i was away i just have to say that the events i will tell you about would not have happened if i were employed..keep that in mind please... Well it all started when i decided to join a senoir womens RECREATIONAL soccer league...that word recreational meaning that i would have to put any effort whatsoever! skip 2 months of half ass playing and we get to this past weekend.... Not only was i guilted into playing a tournament in moncton..i was forced to sleep in a tent the nite prior to the games. This to any other person is fine .... but here is my beef with tents 1-It's a f*ing peice of nylon covering you from the outside world when you sleep 2-I don't care if it says it's waterproof...it's not! 3-weird french ppl still smell in a tent! 4- I want to beat whoever decided that camping was fun sober...get out now we get to the actual tournament...when it says recreational non-competetive ..that does not mean stack your team full of university soccer butches 6 feet tall....there jsut gonna kick me in the face....so the weekend in a sentence... I'm a goalie and i love muddpuddles...NO! Yet the moral of this little story is not that i have a broken nose....it's that none of this would have happened if i was employed....where are all the chauvenist guys when i need them?  P.S. I banged your mom

      After having recovered tonight from my bout of food court food induced sickness (again, fuck you Manchu Wok) I decided the best possible thing for me to do tonight would be to make sweet, sweet love....to my computer.....yes, it's Saturday night and I am spending it alone with my computer....but like always in my life, good things still managed to happen:  1) An old friend messaged me to tell me that my user name of L'il_K would be much more appropriately changed to (and I quote) "Top Heavy Kay"....lonely Saturday night but again my breasts get me through...thank you Thelma...thank you Louise...  2) A Haiku about Jenna Jameson made me laugh...I would tell you about it but Stevo got first dibs...my apologies...love you Haikus...love you even more Jenna Jameson....  3) I discovered that although I love nachos and curly fries, they are not so great as a meal...   4) I discovered through the technology of my webcam that although smoking may be gross, it still makes me look damn cool.....  With hopes that others are having a much more exciting Saturday night overflowing with booze and nudity, I'm out......Peace in the Middle East

      For being a seemingly uneventful day, today has provided me with many thoughts....they are as follows:  1- After having eaten at Manchu Wok in the food court I felt exactly the opposite of sexy...through this experience I was able to conclude that along with the rice and 2 items of choice you are also given a special secret surprise: horrific stomach pains.....MSG...many sick guts?...  2- Although the possibility of marriage is still probably the most frightening thing I can imagine,I too want a gift registry....I wondered if it would be rude of me to invent myself a husband (who I promptly named Austen) and make a gift list at Stokes...so many wine glass sets I NEED, so little chance I will marry before the age of 45...

As i started my day out by finding out that i couldn't even get a job at bulk barn...i thought the day would get only worse...but here are the things that made me feel better 1-downloading "humping around"by Bobby Brown-self explainatory 2- finding out that there is a sticker explaining not to put babies in tubberware...with a picture no less! 3-lips heart lips! 4-the fat ppl that work at wal-mart....do i really have to be wearing a one piece joggin suit when i go on job interviews now?

      My new obsession:   urlLink www.grouphug.us   In response to my obsession I have began to compile a list of my own confessions...Here is installation #1...da da daaa....  1. I actually enjoy the feeling of grease in my mouth after I eat a Chicken McNugget 2. I am uncomfortable in the company of a noisy vacuum 3. I get excited when I listen to the song TNT by AC/DC...to the point that I have to repress fist pumps 4. I used to think that I did the worlds best running man (see: 80s hip hop dance moves)...I would "running man" all over my house...still do except that larger breasts make said "running" slightly uncomfortable without proper athletic gear...however....I keep on "runnin'" 5. My first crush ever was on the host of an educational program.... "Wonder Why"'s Richard Zurawski ( urlLink http://www.rcc.ryerson.ca/ccf/networks/CTV_Television_Program_Details/Wonder_Why.html )  Perhaps my real confession is that I feel no shame...

      Refer to your girlfriend as your "broad" and expect the wrath of hell to fall upon you...in the chance that she appears to find it charming be aware that her happiness is not in response to your comment but rather to the fact that she has another edition to add to the list she is compiling in her head of all the ridiculous things you've done/said...this will be used against you

      Since my recent departure drom my previous job..and by recent i mean 2 months ago....i have come to many conclusions on what i should do with my time off....so i came up with a list 1- travel to foreign places - if you call Saint John foreign..which i do..we can cross that off the list right now... 2- train for a marathon - but who are we kidding? 3- write a novel- it would be good if i didn't have a disorder in which i forget everyones name...  so that was was my list ...but heres what i really did  1-Named the racoons that sit outside my window at nite.... I call the creepy one Fatboy 2-changed the order in which the toothbrushes hung on the tray... 3-thought about changing the lightbulb in the kitchen but later decided that if it was dark then i wouldn't have to do the dishes.... 4-stared at the cat and found out that cats too have facial expressions... 5-made balloon animals which confused me so i made hats instead 6-went to my roomates room and mismatched all her neatly sorted socks
