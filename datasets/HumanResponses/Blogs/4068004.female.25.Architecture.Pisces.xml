						    i'm pretty busy this morning. wake up early to get my sister to lrt-then buy some nasik lemak-breakfast-get dressed laju giler coz its already 8.. and time tu jugaklah air pulak takde.. kenalah mandi air sejuk this morning.. hii.. of all the sudden..without any notice! if u ask me- 'ni mesti keje geng2 construction nearby nih!' ada construction nak buat flat just nearby my house. memang crowded giler.. sekarang ni pun dah jammed kat jalan bawah tu..lagilah kalau ada lagi tambahan population kat sini. Nak marah lelebih pun bukan tanah aku..  Kat umah meriah pagi nih. Pagi2 dapat tengok muka arween ngan fatin bangun sengih-sengih. Best sangat dapat hug ngan kiss diorang pagi-pagi walaupun masam gila..heheh..My niece from melaka pun datang nak spend weekend ngan we all.. my mum just consider her visit as "menyerah diri" sebab there's 2 girls to babysit..sorang demam and sorang gi kecik sangat.. cakap pun tak buleh lagi..haha..we all semua kena keja..so dia lah yang kena.. nasiblahh..  But since she's here.. me and my sister mulalah tanduk kuar nak jalan2.. haha.. tak sedar broke giler.. nanti bila dah keluar tu mulalah nampak itu lahh..nak beli inilah.. since awal bulan we dah buat hat-trick.Went for movies like crazy.. semuanya nak tengok.. (apa lagi ah citer yg tak tengok gi..?)  I'm writing from office today. Still working out my perspective drawing yang tak siap-siap since dunno when. Asal my boss keluar je.. hah.. mulalah cari other thing yang lagi best. No music in the office-pc broke down. no radio-busan gila. aku pulak lupa nak bawak cd ke.. agghh.. takpe.. positive! apepun today is far better than yesterday of course. semalam lagilah dashyat. dah la macam2 jadi since morning. dah petang tu , konon nak release pressure by tulis mail kat mon cher.. punya lah panjang i wrote to him..semuanya lah..all lovey dovey words.. wishing him good luck..etc..etc..for one flat hour.. the minute i clicked the "send" button- baru i nampak ..i typed his address wrong.  AAAAGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH............!!!!!!!!!  Stood still for couple of minutes. Blur. Dunno what to think. Can't even move. Rasa terberenti brain skejap. Then my hp bunyik. (hah..!mon cher) Mangsa lah dia kena dengar i punya cerita pressure stok sepanjang hari punya.. still rasa blur .. when he said "camana boleh salah taip tu....?" and "Camana boleh jadi macam tuuuu...." I still cannot figure out what and why is all that happening to me.. all at once pulak tu...!  Today..tak tau lah apa pulak. So far okey ajer. My boss and I takdelah banyak communicate sangat. Just talk benda yang perlu ajer. Since i'm the only worker he has..so I guess he's trying to keep me to guard his office..picking up calls..design..cadd drawings..presentation drawings.. isk. semualah! He keep on saying he'll find other personnel-but it's been months now since our last designer resigned.. and dah berbulan lah i've been alone in this office. Everything semuanya buat sorang-sorang. Mesti orang kat luar tengok i some kind of pelik. haha.. and my friends pun sometimes make fun of me sebab keje sorang2 nih.  But it turns out i'm very comfortable working alone. I'd do whatever I want at my own pace and kepala otak. No need to gossip or to dress up like crazy..make up like clowns.. there's nobody here.. my boss? haha.. dia lagilah selekeh. He really doesn't mind no matter how i look. He came - ask me daily progress-check letters or fax messages..then at about 10 he'll go out. Dunno where. Then.. he comes back after lunch.. then goes out again.. haha.. My tanduk goes in and out banyak kali gak lah dalam sehari.. I'm not really 'cheating' while working. But since this is a small consulting firm-with various status projects..just making sure my work is done-then only i 'party' laa..bukan sesuka hati jer...haha..  hah..counting hours la nak balik.. bila ada my nephews or nieces kat rumah..mulalah eager sangat nak balik. I'm still far away from 5.30. So.. better fill up my days with works. Sambil2 tu lam kepala dok pikir..(isk.. dapat ke tak aa gaji nanti..?) ..agghh...next month will be tough.. 2 close friends are getting married.. have to spare extra money for hadiah ngan trip gi penang lagi.. ushhkk.. peninggg...  :: this is why kita selalu heran when it comes to 'money'. dialah racun.. dialah ubat..hah...peninggg...

						   It's already 1 pm. As usual i'm not going out anywhere - rasa kelakar lunch sorang-sorang. So i take out my donat and air kosong from home- and have my lunch. Ingat nak call mon cher but I bet dia tengah prepare nak gi semayang Jumaat. Huhh.. today dah Jumaat. Cepatnya masa berjalan. Nanti sabtu-ahad dah joli lebih kurang sikit2..pastu pressure sebab dah monday balik.   Sometimes i nak ajer jadi exceptional. Trying to have a wonderful monday..but back to what we call a 'reality'.. it will bite us back. No need to pretend that we&nbsp;are having so much fun in life,when deep down inside we are crying and dying- asking for a better 'everything'. I know i sound 'tak bersyukur dengan apa yang ada'.. but as a person.. i would say that this "reality" thing is very tough. Very.. very tough..!   Maybe i've seen better picture of life before.. my parents, as far as i remember ..were government servants..we moved around west semenanjung a lot..which influent my perangai now... quarters with security guards..good schools..home-tuitioned..few friends of course.. pindah again.. new school..same thing..bla..bla.. but now i realise..all that somehow broaden and at the same time narrowing my scope of life.   Conflicts. when i was in Kuantan for my diploma.. new friends again.. but with various background. Then only reality sikit-sikit nak tunjuk belang. Tengok everyone punya true colour..&nbsp; but then mana matured lagi.. nak 2 time tu lah baru rasa freedom.. with course yang memang banyak visits.. Back to reality punya cerita.. still i don't really pikir sangat pasal susah nak cari duit etc..&nbsp; takde duit..call.. ada new project..call.. (haa.. wonder what i'd say if i'm in my mama's place then..) sure nangis punye lahhh..   Degree was ok financially.. sebab i ada loan. But still mintak kat abah bila dah ujung semester.. Tapi banyak habis kat travel lah.. minyak.. tol.. huu..  Then only that REALITY keep on haunting me.. jahat betull..  Since i graduate last year.. anything I wanted to do seems to be blocked. Tak yah mention during study dulu memang dah pening gile nak habiskan even satu semester.. but this time it's different. I'm grateful i did manage to finish school before..and since everything is giving me a hard time sekarang..i fell kinda LOST.   Time tu la nak cari keja susah..apply nak further study-my degree pulak dikata tak diiktiraf .. sadly i have to defer my cardiff offer to&nbsp;next year.. with nothing promising.. hope my abah won't say anything about me wasting money for exams etc.. (erghhh..sad!sad!) At last.. dapat lah keja sini.. alaa..sini..yang tak best nih...(again tak grateful lansung!!heh)&nbsp;  With that kinky boss.. nearby office from home..kira okey laa than dok rumah idling waiting for my parents to feed me. Malulahh..dah suku abad umur still takde profesion lagi. Although tak satisfied sangat with salary scheme-i accept this job and try to be more positive with it..(grateful..) hehe..  Almost 4 months here..with 1 months party sebab my boss went to China to participate in new project (that's what he claim laa..) I dunno how to describe - how my life has been. Sruggling - saving nak kawin la.. daily expenses laa.. entertainment..belanja mama tosei..phone bills.. bla..bla..bla.. hah! Is this my life i'm going through??&nbsp; Now only i learn how to aprreciate each cent in my purse... dah pulak my boss critically takde income,and as expected - kacau perjalanan gaji aku laa.... who's to blame? Ntahh..   Abah pun dah bising my phone bill makin banyak and banyak... Then, banyak jugak benda2 jahat yg allure my attention.. bantal pires lahh.. perfume laahhh..aussino bedsheet laa.. huu.. sedar2 ajer my purse tinggal syiling.. tu pun sempat lagi sedekahkan kat public phone.. heh.. cintaaaa.. cam gitu lahhh..   Why aah..? Why is it has to happen to me..? Is it I don't give enough thinking and vision when i was younger.. ?I should have expected all this. My mama constantly reminding everyone of us that life upfront is not going to be easy.. familiar words like " Mama takde harta lain nak bagi.. just ilmu ajer..itu lah yang all of you kena pakai nak hidup" ..  And now.. it does make sense...  Although nak kena kena face tough&nbsp;times sementara nak habiskan July nih.. I should give more attention towards myself &nbsp;..and more thoughts about future..maybe sebelum ni tak cukup thoughts ( that's why kat mulut kata nak jimat tapi tangan dok membeli) .. sebab tu still consider all this as burden..unfair..etc..   And maybe I should look forward to dekatkan diri ngan Tuhan..  &nbsp;

						   Tough morning..but yet cold and breezy..the only thing that make me smile - henman win 1st round kat toronto ..(heh!) ..then headed to office as usual-alone-with nothing to be expected..&nbsp;tapi dalam banyak2 benda- my pc broke down!   no more YM with frenz and mon cher.. another sebab nak tambah busan kat my days.. ergghhhh!! jammed skejap kepala.. heh! tapi still okey.. using another pc.. start wandering what to do..mulalah search sana..search sini..kot2 ade mende narik nak baca etc.. then i came across my sister's fren punya blog..mmm..narik tu... create blog sendiri.. takdelah busan sangat..heheh..then..klik sana sikit..sini sikitt..heheh.. my first publishing.. so jangan gelak tau? sebab standard lah beginner...  hehe..  mm.. so far nothing much to say. dalam kepala dok serabut ngan pc yang dah jem tu.. tatau nak buat apa.. tak berenti asyik scan disc ajer..nak shut down pun gagal jugak...heh.. biar ajerlah dulu.. so hope from now on-my days will be much ..much better with this new i-don't-know-how-to-say&nbsp; hobby..(can i say hobby?) ape2 jelah! selalu kita cakap dalam hati ajer pasal everything .. so now, at least boleh express anything yang kita wish to say.. hope boleh fill up my days yang almost "empty' tu..   i've read a few blogs yg i rasa mmg very interesting..about how they felt.. and i felt satisfied sebab there are things yang i wish to say out loud and that somebody dah tolong expresskan..heheh..so from now on.. my turn pulak.. hope i can be as good as that writer..(of course she's good..she's a writer!) but from what she had said ..kebanyakkannya mmg betul and i learn a lot from her writings.. thanks! she gave me some kind of encouragement - and have my own blog...heh!  :: everyday kena ada something new kita kena belajar kan? so.. this is for today... : )

						    Indecisive - Empty Decorations   I wake in the dark   Showers of light   Moments of emptiness around   Floating away   No rays of hope   Reality brings me to the ground      What can I do?    What can I say?   I need a place to hide away   Just for a while, just for a smile   Just for the life I used to know      For every song was filled with words of love and not of anger   What if they go?   What if they leave me far behind?    'Cause I don't wanna be alone.. (uh oh)   Living life for on my own (uh oh)   I don't want to live my life in isolation   Filled with empty decorations'   Cause I wanna be with people that I know   Who would do the things I do (uh oh)   Making all my dreams come true (uh oh)   I don't recognize the shadows at my door   Though I've seen them all before   Because the only thing I really want..   Is to be with you....    I look at the sky,   That looks back at me   I'm getting a silent melody   I know that I'm here      And I am lost   Alone and confusion by the breeze   Hiding my face, crying alone   I need to find my way back home   Back to the place   The wonderful days   Livin' the life I used to know   For every smile was born out of the love and our sincerity   And every tear from all the glowing joy    [chorus]x2'   Cause I don't wanna be alone.. (uh oh)   Living life for on my own (uh oh)   I don't want to live my life in isolation   Filled with empty decorations   'Cause I wanna be with people that I know   Who would do the things I do (uh oh)   Making all my dreams come true (uh oh)   I don't recognize the shadows at my door   Though I've seen them all before   Because the only thing I really want..   Is to be with you....     Is to be with you   Living life for on my own (uh oh)   I don't wanna live my life in isolation   Filled with empty decorations'Cause    I wanna be with people that I know   Who would do the things I do (uh oh)   Making all my dreams come true (uh oh)   I don't recognize the shadows at my door   Though I've seen them all before    Because the only thing I really want..      Is to be with you....

						     My sis forwarded me this blog.. her frens's fren's frens' blog. hehh.. lantaklah sapa punye.. but i kinda like what she's blabbering around.. same age as mine and probably got the same thoughts too... I agree quite a lot with her words.. for instance this one.. of she said how other people ( i think what she means is people who already married) should give more support and positive advices towards newly married and singles who's still looking for partners - as what she referred to 'threats' of how miserable can a marriage be. Come'on ol pals.. you guys should show us matured acts and words aa.. bukannya demoralise us lagi..

						    What a day today..!      I finally have time to breathe..although I prefer to stay home and sleep. It's the same ME..stucked in this lil' office - ALONE AGAIN.. but today's different. 3days before, i worked around the clock to finish the Kajang project - and today's the presentation. He wanted me to do the presentation at first-but since he didn't finish his work- so he has to do all the answering  with the client. Padan muka! hehehehhe..      Nothing doing. PC selalu hang and I'm not into anything today. Rasa best sangat ! And I finally can send my resume to 2-3 tempat... and finish up my davidoff contest.. hak..hak.. suka sangat FREE hari nih..      Remember yesterday I was grumbling about myself and everything around me..and suddenly get cooled down for no reason..? I have no instinct or anything..but I accepted my chillin' feelin' yesterday as a good start of being positive..       And when I got home yesterday, an interview letter was on my dad's bed. I was thrilled. Wow..another TEST? This is what i've been dreaming for.. a permanent job with the government...Part of me was jumping and another part was whispering pessimis words in my ears.. 'will there be another heartbreak after 3 major upset news i heard this year..?      No! This is not certainly not myself. Try first girl. Go for it!       The thing is.. I am scared. Maybe a bit skeptical with what's going on and whatever things that already happened to me recently.  Mama said to me.. 'If God has written that the job is for you..then nothing to worry.. it'll be yours. If not.. stay where you are. There might be another better offer coming'.        Everyone was excited when I told them about the news.. mon cher..etc.. but apparently I 'm thrilled.       Thank GOD I have one whole day to rest my mind today.       What to do ah? There's still 45 mins  to head back home. Haahhh.. home sweet home.. My sister forwarded me a few blogs to read... nice.. bleh habiskan time baca blog orang.. kinda learn wat's in people's mind.. and how they speak it out..OUTLOUD. Let's hear what he thinks about love. haha..       "Ehm...to me,  true love is demonstrated when you can overlook his/her mistakes and love him/her your best possible ways. Security and stability in a relationship will eventually result in a couple trying that hard to treat each other with love and of course, respect. So peeps, I'd say - go fall in love. Passionately. Ardently, if you're young. Give it your best shot."        "Check out the site on the movie. and tell me guyz, do u think love comes softly? which brings up the next question - can love ever be based on simply physical needs? Is it enough to stick to someone just for the sake of convenience? whatever happens to real feelings? u know, sexual stuffs aside.and... ouh, how about lust? do we stream together love and lust when we look for that special someone? Has finding your perfect   soulmate become an impossible quest nowadays? With all the short-lived relationships, there seems to be alot of hurdles for couples only for them to have permanent break-ups. Makes me wonder - why bother to fall in love then? Back to work i guess..."       And this quote .." coffee : how do you turn your eyes...from the romantic glare?"       Halo encik... that's my favorite song aa... hahaha...I only know him from my sis who's doing practical training in central KL.Never met him whatsoever. I just know him by name. I read his blog - and find it..very interesting! A lot of things that really make sense. Hmm.. That's why orang selalu cakap.. go and get some friends.. and you'd probably knows everything in the world..hahah..      Erghhh.. i miss my nephews and nieces... nothing but smile on my face.       Intann : Let's see if tomorrow is going to be tolerable to me.. Mon cher..i miss you!!

						    Finally I got myself and my thoughts back.       Still sittin' on the same chair, listening to music mon cher gave me recently.. they really keep me accompany. Thanks mon cher. An ol' 80's song which i used to listen when i was a kid- Tommy Page's A shoulder to cry on.  I'm cool now.. no more protests or grumbles.       I took my thoughts for a short tour. To remember that I still have A LOT of things and LOVE ONES by my side. To remember that there's still other people who is far in need than I am.       I wonder what I'd do if God suddenly put me in a war town or something.. Will I fight to survive..? Will I just lay there waiting to die..? Will I help others..? What would I do..?? Hah..? Will my soul ever get strong..?  By hook or by crook.. I have to be strong.. I have to be.. Nobody else will help me.. they'll surely covering their own ass !        So..Intann..? Ready to take the steps..?       It's 2nd of Rejab now. I guess it's time to get back to things you've taken for granted for quite so long now... and you know you can never get any stronger without the blessings of God.

						    It's monday again. Believe it. Buang masa ajer if you still cannot accept that time is moving soooooooooo fast and that you're having a tough time in life.       Oh no. Must remember my resolution last week. POSITIVE. Okey..okey..       It's monday-but different from other mondays. Today i have loads of works to do. I 've finished with Platinum Condo drawings last week- and now come newly proposed Kajang housing development. Presentation on coming thursday and I have to start from zero. ALONE. My boss?? dunno where he is- but thank GOD he's not here. haha..      I have so much to say-but no time at all. Right now i'm chatting with mon cher-now  in his  hometown for a short break. Something's  coming up i guess - we have to stop chatting for a while. Alaa.. already 1.30. Have to stop now. Get back to y'all after Thursday !!       Intann : The truth is- I'm still the same. It's just things surrounding me is moving and evolving and changing.... do not worry. Okey?

						    I read my best friend's email just now.. suddenly i felt lost.       She asked me whether i already got the invitation card-which i did received last week. I was planning to call her but - with so much to think- i forgot. As usual- we talk.. She told me that she's been counting days now-12 days to go. She's getting married..!! Can you believe it..? She was the one I used to quote as 'kanak-kanak riang' - as she's a petite gal.. ( now I dunno- its been months since I last met her) but for sure..selalu hilangnye lah kat supermarket tu! hehhehehe....       At the end of the mail, she wrote - although she's married- we shall be friends - the same as we used to be. That 'lost' feeling dragged me into tears.      I replied her mail. Promise her that i will be the same..as i wish her too. I was crying while typing-as if being so skeptical- (of what?? of losing her..?) I am glad she's getting married.. She's a good person - and definitely deserve a good one also. (Yeen..better be good to her, ok?)        It's been 10 years now since I met her and since then-we never stop talking! 10 years..? Can u believe that nida? All sorts of stories was once our topics- studies, exams, boys, love, crushes, heart-breaks, new friends..ol' friends.., then love again..drop-dead-cute-office-attire guys, my ANs..your ABANs..hahahah.. so much we've said and laughed about.. and I miss all that.. so much..

						    My brother always come up with silly words- and usually we all ended up laughing about it.. Words like..'harrraaammm...'..'sadissss..' tu semua memang kat mulut la...!My sister and I were suggesting going for Halle Berry's latest show- Catwoman. We usually 'have' to be accompanied by him..and his wife. But plan malam ni - only us ajer sebab mama abah tader kann.. hehehe...      I'm writing from office. No urgent work to do. Still.. a lot of calls to do..       Where is my 'intann to do' list?? hah?      Tapi my fingers still on this keyboard- chat ngan adi n my sis. hish..macam2 plan lah kami nih! Nanti bila dah petang mulalah kalut..heheh..       Err..best ke cerita kucing betina tu...? mon cher said it was given so much publicity-but-not as he expected.. heh.. dunnolah how comic-addict talks bout their stuffs. I usually end up angguk ajer.. hehe.. malam kang my turn pulak nak komen.      Hah.. makan invitation again! I have another sister who endlessly ajak both of us to her house. She's the one with two boys (sorang penakut-sorang gi energetic terlebih!) Alternate week - she'll be alone sebab her hubby is out to work. Just don't imagine how are these 2 boys are..! So - if ada invitation ajak makan n tido at her place tu.. equals to babysitting up until 1-2 in the morning. Haha..dunno lah air bateri cap apa yang diorang minum..      oit! nak gi tak ?      :: Intann - movie..works..borang to settle.. what to eat tonite..? buy ink cartridge..bla..bla..the list goes on.... haaaaaa......(yawn..)

(wish u luck!)      Saje jer kuar dari rumah 5 mins to 9. My boss is still in Genting and this is the best opportunity nak mengular.. hahaha.. smooth flowing traffic - good music - enough! i arrived at the office feeling 'okey'. Haha..       Actually i'm delighted! Arsenal won the Community Shield game last night meeting with traditional rival- Man Utd - and it was really..really..an entertaining game. At first i was down sebab pires was not in the list- tapi since dah lama tak tengok game.. Eager sangat nak tengok this team main semalam sans familiar faces.. no more viera.. kanu..parlour...ergh... still they have to move on. The world's moving right?? so..nev'mind laa..new faces pun.. everyone pun penah jadi new faces gak dulu..so.. the kick-off!      Awesome! As if semua pun dah busan sebab dah lama tak main-so everyone seemed to be so energetic! Attemps were breathtaking..cuma finishing jer kantoi.. still.. thumps-up to all new faces! Fabregas..Hoyte..Clichy..van Persie..heheh.. good work guys! Reyes deserved his Man-of the Match award-elok la dah nak patah riuk pinggang..haha.. 3-1 full time result. Inclusive one own goal. Charming Cole! hahahah...  So, starting next week- no more jalan2 during match nights...       So much thing to do today. My sister and I have to list down everything we have to do since mama ngan abah nak travel North. A lot (uisk..banyak lahh!) aktiviti-aktiviti tak berpaedah lingers in our minds- jahat betull... mulalah nak tengok movie tu la..ni laaa.. hah..camana..? But still..i have to settle down everything regarding job application first. Have to photostate forms and all.. urghh.. penatnyee....       ::Intann - Help! Where to start..? I've so much to sayyy.....

						    Mmm.. just had my lunch..dish sama jer almost everyday..nasik-ayam-bayam-dua inggitt.. and all ALONE..: (       It's pay-day today.. as usual..macam2 resolution untuk bulan nih.. nak jimat la.. no shoes..no fast foods..no macam2 lagilah.. but tengoklahh..by the time lalu depan kedai tu.. mulalah sakit kepala laa..ketar lututlaa.. purse bergegar laa... wonder why is all that stuff so tempting..? hehee.. macam boleh dengar aje my mum punya nag dalam kepala..huhh..cakap pasal duit memang takkan habis sampai kiamat pun.. (really annoyed with my phone bills...!)       I came across lagu Amy Grant-That's what love is for this morning on my way to work.. hahh..!! Dah agak dah.. they really dragged me into 'emotional' daydreaming again.. love..love and love..with everybody is pursuing love nowadays.. we sometimes forget that love can be a cruel deceit. Believe me or not... those kinda songs actually lead us to become a love devoter or a soul provider...which is for me.. not suitable for those who has a partner who don't really care about what love is all about..       We hear a lot about love stories..not to mention all love movies that we take 'em as a perfect dream-dying to get one love life similar to that.. start la berangan jadi heroin la..hero laa..haha..! ( If you asked who's my perfect hero..Jude Law-empty face-tall and skinny.. haha.. get me off my feet) usk..lari tajuk dah ni..!       I wonder macam mana people want from love nowadays. Macam-macam yang I dengar since forever.. failed relationship..tak cukup understanding la.. betrayals..tak honest with each other..find new guy/gal.. where the hell all the vows once uttered from their mouth..? bukan man ajer yang I know simply take people heart for granted..girls pun.. sama je... hu..     .. I owed my mum for her continuous advise - " do not LOVE a man more then they love you.. " , "girls shouldn't be the one craving..or she'll be   the one crying ".. after my first relationship failed 4 years ago, then only I know what she meant.. (blur betul dulu2..) haha..      I'm glad it's over. I moved on - with new rule for myself. Don't ever let a  loser  enter and rule your life. . worst lagi to love 'em..lagi worst if you deny his mistake!      Intann : Once mon cher asked me..how I want him to be.. I answered him..      " Be a MAN..like a man should be."

						   Wonder if you guys ade dengar lagu from Ally McBeal- banyak yang best.. but this 'alone again' song - captured my attention sebab quite slow and sedey skit lagu dia.. I dengar  for quite some times before i know that the lyrics bukanlah totally 'love' based. Dia try nak cerita hidup dia since dulu.. always have to cope with person she love died and leave her alone.. try lah dengar one day..really nice!.  Mm.. talking pasal 'death' ni..(Frankly-i'm scared..) I dua tiga menjak nih quite often dreamed pasal dead people.. people accident.. my father's close friend accident and return home.. macam2 lah..! (usk.. dahlah uncle tu suppose to join us jalan2 pegi Thai next month!) memang if kita just cakap pasal 'death' ni kita rasa okey ajer.. but at the moment kita browse balik what we've been doing all thru this living years..and banyak SINS dari KEBAJIKAN.. then only we think twice.. kan? kan?  Just pagi tadi..on my way to work.. I saw one slight survivor just 10metres ahead of me. One old Chinese man..driving an Iswara- dunno where he's heading to..(kalut sangat)..time2 jammed macam tu nak jugak move hastily.. but to my surprise.. (and his of course!) he was hit by a tanker- I should say he's fortunate enough sebab it was right betul2 the driver's side. Kalau that tanker speed lebih sikit..hah.. I by now mesti muntah tengok flesh and blood..  But think again man.. A tanker tu.. nasib tak baik.. hah..dapatlah tengok 'live' explosion .. tu pun kalau I tak involve sekali.. (huuu..mintak simpangg..) I tak kawin lagi lahh..  But this is not sebab I still tak kawin then I'm talking about this.. tapi kalau you all tengok muka that ol'man - you guys akan rasa dia ni try nak commit suiside ke..? selamber gile.. Walaupun panic..(sikit2 ajelah potray panic tu) tapi.. once he's out of the car.. siap pointed out to the tanker's driver..dunnolah.. marah ke..maki ke.. still nak denied his mistake.. huh.. he should be grateful he still alive man...(wonder where his heart is..hehe)  For whom yang penah been thru an accident-akan tau the real feeling. Betul.. just by thinking of it right now- memang rasa eerie sangat.. i was 4 going to be 5..when i had an accident involving my uncle's car and a taxi loaded with people. My Mak Teh brought my sis and me to a kenduri kawin in Perlis. We were already on our journey back to Alor Star.  Everything was okey at first. i was  sound asleep-then i heard a loud collision-i saw blood-blood and blood everywhere..i was in a total blur. Someone dragged me and my sister out of the car.. but the truth is- i can't feel myself.. i can remember things-but the shocking current still overpowered me then. my aunt and uncle were motionless. the moment i saw them..i felt unprotected. I cried.  Then the collision sounds and pictures of blood repeatedly playing in my mind..(up until now you know..) i was scared to death.. i felt so small..but i can still picture everything very clearly.. like it is always been part of myself. My uncle and aunt died in that accident-leaving 8 children.  With that.. I grow up feeling phobia with accident. Takut weh.. tapi takdelah sampai tak kuar mana2 or tak drive. Ada gak time yang I drive nak cepat etc.. tapi when I see news ke.. lori besar2 speeding.. haa.. time tu.. mulalah mulut baca macam2..takut la..  But one thing I learn from that.. not to follow the same mistake again. ( I know it's not my uncle and aunt's mistake that I have to be in that tragedy..)no one's is to be blame.. betul. Maybe it's God fate kami alami  semua tu.. and now I come across the same situation where I ada gak bawak my nieces and nephews keluar jalan2.. so time tu lah all this pictures and sound playing in my mind. C'est horrible man.. trust me.   Once my cousin asked me why I drive slow sangat one time tu..kami konvoi balik my mum's house sesama .. with their only daughter insisted to go with me. So.. dah lah lalu jalan yang I paling phobia..slow jelah... lagipun bukannya nak rush pegi mana ye ak..? Why I drive slow sangat..? I repeat.. Slow..? better slow laa... kan..? Apa I nak jawab if anything happen to us..?  guys.. value your life ok..?  why am I talking about this today?? Entah.. that ol' man pagi tadi tu laa..  hish.. wonder what he's thinking.. hope he learn something..  And as expected.. that fatal incident movie played again..I just cannot imagine have to face life without our love ones..  Aghhhh.. God I'm so scared....  Al-Fatihah to Pak Teh and Mak Teh..I can still remember you guys..
