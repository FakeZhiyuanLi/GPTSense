      It was the last day to see the Brown family at my church. A little sad, but all in all hopefully some good things will came out of this. Although I still want to do what I can to keep in touch with them. There was some pretty good food there which I think I ate too much of. They will be missed.  On to the last week of school...finals...Ewe...I'm not a big fan of taking tests. I just hope I do good on my History and Chemistry...those are the ones that I am worried about. My grandparents are coming down this week too...I forgot already...wow what a busy week I have ahead of me.  Well off to mowing the lawn I guess, today is still a non stop day.  :]  out.

      Today I spent most of my time at a baby shower. It was a friend of mine's sister who is just about due and she's looking it too. Although I must say she does look pretty good to me 8 months along. I gave her a blanket and pillow that I made which she really liked.  I had fun, but I am exhusted and need to take a nape or do something that doesn't envolve me thinking too much.   Tomorrow is a pot luck at my church in thanks to our pastor and family who are leaving our church. They were a great family who has helped us along very much and we just want to say thanks. Although I do say I may cry tomorrow when they say their good byes...who knows ;) we will all miss them.  I better get back to doing some more work and then take a break.  Who knows I may post again later tonight.  bye bye for now.

      Today was my dads birthday celebration which was pretty fun.  I go to see my brother and sister again, they havn't been aroung much lately. During this celebration we get a phone call that my grandparents are coming down from Oregon...which also is a cool thing, but it's not for a good reason. Apparently my uncle is very sick with cancer and has to go through surgery soon so they are coming down for support. And for those who say prayers, it would be greatly appreciated.   I am getting very tired now so good night.

      It was busy as usual.   First off, I woke up at 5:30 this morning and went to work with my dad. I swept and moped the store...Might I say it looked pretty good ;) Then my mom picked me up at 8:30am after she got off of work. I went to Target to use my gift card...I bought two CD's: Carried Me by Jeremy Camp and Casting Crowns. I love Jeremy Camp. His songs just have so much meaning in them that it gives me the chills. OK after Target we went to Gottshalks then Macy's. Then straight to Delano to take an elderly lady shopping. In the middle of that I met up with my sister at Wendys for lunch. Then back to shopping with that same person. Finally I get home. I didn't mind doing all that, but I had a terrible headache as usual. I finally bought medicine that will hopefully help these migranes. Then I kept working and cleaning the house for more guests that are coming by the end of the week. Then I jump back into the car to go to Wednesday night Bible study. It went really good, but attendance is still VERY low right now. Again back home...I set up a Holiday projector for my parents, which they like very much.  I then find out that my cat is going to have kittens. Whoopee, I say with sarcastic attitude...I love animals, but I have no need for more.  Lets see....I'll list them for you:  Dog: Minnie  2 Cats: Monkey and the pretty one with the green eyes(we never gave that one a name)  Rabbit: Jasper  Hamster: Chew Toy  And last, but not least My bird: Shark Bate (which by the way my friend Chuck named about a year ago or so)  And to finish off my busy day...I now think I will fall asleep.

      Sorry I haven't posted in a while; things got too busy before I knew it and soon almost another week past by like nothing. I did fin time how ever to go a shopping spree with my mom. We went to Macy's. Now we normally don't go there, but my mom received a gift card from one of her past clients husbands as a thank you for my moms help. This gift card was more than we could just about handle. Lets see it was......$500. Can you believe how long that took us to buy that much stuff. Yeah, Macy's is extremely expensive, but when your used to always looking for the lowest prices, you can find some good deals at Macy's, which meant buying more things to use up the card. I do have to say it took us two days to use up the card...We failed at making it one. Shopping is exhausting. Have a great week. And God Bless.

      We got back today from vacation just in time for church...Well we were a little late, but we made it.  Over all it was a good camping trip. The funniest part of it all was the melodrama. I know this sounds crazy, but those are the best things to go to when you need to laugh. It was great...The song I liked the best is one on 'How I would have written you a letter, but I couldn't spell(I'm gunna take a wild guess at this so bare with me) ppppllluuuhhhh'....You know when you stick your tongue out and make a farting noise...yeah...like that.  Anyways everything is slowly getting back into order and, but tomorrow my mom is going to work for days straight 24 hour shifts. This means I will have to put all the camping gear away by myself...Oh well, I need the exercise after gaining a few extra pounds...hopefully it was all muscle from walking a lot in the sand...LOL  Time to start catching up on other things around here.

      Well, my grandparents left today after church, and now I'm off to the coast tomorrow.  Sorry there will be no posts for a little while unless I go the nearest library.  It should be fun though...Going with my friend Jennifer never fails all the excitement ;) And for my parents, on Wednesday is there 25 wedding anniversary, so they  are going to go out to eat. Me and Jennifer will be stuck with toasting marshmallows for diner...oh well I like marshmallows anyways ;)  Life has been more up beat around here and it still is progressing as we will be heading out for the coast.   God bless and have a great week!

      It's the last day for my grandparents to be here, they will be leaving sometime tomorrow back to Oregon.   Also my uncle Don is doing a lot better and is actually eating real foods now. He gets up to walk around, but can't do anything major or his stitches will pop out.  Tomorrow is another Sunday with our sub pastor, John Lopez...lots of exciting moments to come ;)   Today felt like a lazy day for me, although I did mow the lawn and get the dishes done. Other than that I just sate around the house doing nothing.  Monday I will be headed out for vacation to the coast with a friend and family...It should be a good break for our family.  Until then good bye.

      Today was the funeral, followed by a reception at my grandma's house. I saw some old relatives that I knew and haven't seen in a long time. More then half though where family members that I had never seen in my life...that I know of at least.  After the funeral I tried taking a nap...I got maybe 30 minutes of good rest. Then I drove to town with my parents and did a few things...picked up my sister in law...then it was off to Bakersfields Home Town Buffet. Might I add, you can gain ten pounds in ten minutes ;)   I am exhausted so I will try to sleep, night everyone.

      Lately around here it has been a little weird, I guess that's not all that strange considering that there has been a death in the family. I might say we have been getting a LOT of phone calls constantly, knowing my house, the phone usually rings maybe three times a week. So just very awkward.  Losing someone that close that wasn't expected to die all that soon, it really gets to you after a while. Just a few months ago Lori took me to the March meets and know she's gone. One beautiful thing, though, that I got to see was her spitituality, and love for God grow in just a very short amount of time. And I know for a fact that she is in heaven....Why?...Well right when she got to the hospital that first night with my dad, she asked if she was saved. And her and my dad talked and they straightened out the situation.... And any time someone talks about getting saved it is truly a serious, joyful, emotional, but happy thing for me to see, it brings tears to my eyes. Some people out there may know what I am talking about and others may not, but if there are any questions or comments...please leave them for me or write to me at(baby_blue537@hotmail.com).   Right now is a difficult time in my life anyways, that when I see people pass on, it affects me in different ways than others.  I am now a Senior and when I start to look at where I am headed, it doesn't bring joy to my life. Don't get me wrong, I like my life and I'm not doing anything wrong to make it worse, it's just I want to be exactly where God wants me to be. I have thought about becoming a Nurse, a veterinarian, and even a Missionary, but I have no clue right now where I am supposed to be. So I take it day my day hour by hour seeing what is next to come.  All I ask is just for more prayers, you can never have too many of those.

      Today at church went really smooth, our sub pastor for now is a really nice guy who is about 6'3"...his wife reminds me of my aunt cheryl a lot.  But after church we went out to eat with them and a few other church members...might I say we had a great time.  After that me and my sister went to the hospital to take over watching my aunt Lori and help her do things...we basically just massaged her legs and kept her as comfortable as possible. We were there for about 4-5 hours, then my dad shows up after getting some sleep to take care of her. I go home and tell people who call, about how she was...and then I get a phone call from my sister...she said Lori passed away at 5:55pm. That was only about 30 minutes after me and my sister were relieved from taking care of her. The last thing I told her was, "see you latter Lori"...and she waved good bye.

      When I went and saw my aunt Lori today, she was VERY tired, but all there this time.   From the hallucination state and saying she didn't care to see me, it went to a smile and saying "Hi Honey" when I walked into the room.  We visited for about 5-10 minutes, but her eyes would shut every now and then so we decided to leave and let her rest. Tonight my dad will be staying with her all night...also in hopes to get enough sleep before church tomorrow.  There will be a person that is ministering at our church for the month of June while we are still in search for a new pastor.  Please continue the prayers for my family as well as the church...they are greatly appreciated.

      Last night was the graduation ceremony at DHS and a friend of mine, Jessica, was in it. Yay....she made it, now on to college she will go.  Updates:         Lori-not doing well, we see what is to come day by day now and hope for the best.          Don-As of just an hour ago they had to take him back into surgery unexpectedly. I don't know for what reason, but when I got home this morning, there was a note left by my grandma saying, "Don went back into surgery, we will call when we find out more." That was about it, so now the waiting process continues.  Have a great day everyone!

      My sister, me, my mom, and my dad all went to the hospital to visit Lori again today...just to keep her company. She started off by telling my mom to shut up when she said Hi. Then she said she didn't care that we came to see her and told us to go away. I guess the hallucinations started to kick in and she is REALLY not her self any more. There is more to the story, but it is really too sad to even think about it. They even had to tie her to the chair in her room.  On the other hand I am more than excited that today was the last day of school, but all my sick family members are really getting me down...and I tend to worry too much about everything anyways that the sicknesses don't help one bit. Sometimes I wish my friends were online more often so I can talk to them...I don't have enough guts though to even start the conversation when they are...and when ever I do they never really talkback. A lot of the times though, they are too busy anyways.  I know some people may think I am complaining too much over everything, but that was the whole point of this blog, it was to get worries off my mind. Even if no one ever reads this blog that's fine by me. At least it's not all building up inside of me like it used to.  These past few days have been really tuff for me, but I know that God is in it all. Yeah, people may have there doubts at times, but you learn that bad things happen and not just for any reason at all. You learn to deal with them and move on...Like today at the Ranch(aka grandma's house) I almost cried about ten times while my dad told the bad news about Lori...you know how you get that large lump in your throat when you try not to cry...well back to the point...I start to think about all the wonderful things that God has done in my life as well as Lori's and say, God she is all yours there is nothing that I can do to stop what is in your will. And every time that put a comfort feeling inside of me, even though there was nothing I can do...I knew God was in control.  So all in all a VERY sad day, but again life goes on and God is Good all the Time.

      After school today I went back to the hospital to visit my aunt Lori and found out what she has now. She has pancreactic cancer that has spread through her body and there is no way of treating it because it is so far along.  I also just heard that she only has a few days left to live...:(...My grandma didn't take it well, neither did my aunt-who can blame them-and they Really need a lot of prayers right now. Both my grandma and aunt are not believing that she really has the cancer.  Well, again both of my parents didn't get to work today and that's hard on our family, not having that extra pay check. So if you can please pray for us too. My mom is going to stay at the hospital tonight for the second time just in case something may go wrong.  That's all for now...I'll keep up-dating when I get more news.

      At 4 this morning, 6/2/04, we get a phone call and I just thought that my dad's store alarm went off and he had to go to work early, but then about ten minutes later my mom walks in my room and says, "grandma Betty called and we need to take Lori to the hospital".  Those of you who don't know Lori is my aunt who has been very ill for the last few months.  Well I normally don't get up until about 5:30 or 6 to get ready for school, but I couldn't go back to sleep. At 6 I hear someone knocking at the door and I'm the only one home so I go answer it...It's my Grandparents from Oregon. Apparently they are here for my uncle Don who is very ill too that I've mentioned before and has to go through surgery.  Then I go off to school on the bus and leave my grandparents alone at the house...After school and finals, I walk to the church where my mom was going to pick me up, only to find My sister there waiting for me.  We go to the hospital and relieve my parents from waiting with Lori since 4 in the morning.  All along while my grandparents are stuck in the middle of all this.  My sister finally brings me home at around 7, and just to keep my grandparents busy I play the game Train Dominos with them.(by the way my mom is still at the hospital with Lori and will be all night). Which now comes down to me writing you after I got out of the shower.  It's 10:35 on my computer so I think I'd better try to get a better nights sleep. Also in hopes tomorrow will be a better day. Good Night and God Bless!

      Wow, first day of finals and I had to write 5 essays and answer about 10 questions. Not all that exciting, but life is still good...I just can't hardly wait until this week is over. Then it's off to summer vacation and maybe some work??. I have a feeling life will get even more interesting after school is out.  Today after finals I decided to finish making the purses that I have been meaning to finish and send them off to be sold. Well it's been a long 7 hours and I still need about 10. Who knows hopefully I can be finished with them even earlier, make a few more bucks to take with me when I go to the coast with family and a friend named Jennifer.  On to my grandparents, I heard they are coming tomorrow, which is Wednesday. Wednesdays are already busy with school, church, and homework, I don't know if I even have time to clean my room. We will see what happens there.  Time to get back to studying for more finals :P

      I don’t know what has been going on with my entries, but they didn’t appear every time I tried to post them…Only the title would show up. I hope I can fix the problem before it happens again, or to where it will never happen again, I don’t know. I guess I need to learn more about computers. I never was really good at them, I just liked exploring with them, but at times I really get frustrated with them and want to throw them out the window. Oh well, I’ll try to clean up this mess of posts that haven’t shown up then I’ll try to post more often. With school going to start up and all I may not have as much time. I even applied at a place for a job. I need some extra cash to fix up my Jeep…It has problems with over heating…If any one knows about a good car shop that is cheep around here, please tell me, it will help a lot.  That’s all for now…Good Night!

      As you can tell lately there hasn't been many posts....I have been gone part of the time and busy the rest.   Lets see.....Last Thursday I went to Hume lake with a friend and her church. I was pretty fun. I staid there for about three days. We got back on Saturday afternoon.&nbsp;Then on Sunday I went to church as the usual. Here comes the fun part, after church this time we went to eat Mexican food with some friends. Might I say it was pretty delicious....Today my mom got off work and picked me up at my dads work. We then went shopping for a few things we needed and then bought a pool.&nbsp; It was so hot today, we couldn't take it much longer, so we bought a pool. It's not a huge one, but it fits about five people.   Then I guess it comes right down to now, while I am writing this entry and talking to a friend online.&nbsp; Sooo I guess not much happened, but I felt really busy.   Time to go and finish up some more business.

      Life can be very dificult at times...most of the time for that matter.  This past week has been rough...I was yelled at, and gotten on to for the stupidest things so many times, it took me for ever to calm down. I think either I'm going crazy or everyone esle is around me. If anyone knows me, they know that I hate being yelled at or gotten on to about something...I mean you might as well shoot me then yell at me. I'm a big baby when it cames to yelling...I cry if someone yells at me...You can hit me, kick me, spit on me, do anything, but yell and I wont cry. A lot of the things I've done lately may have not been the best things, but people make mistakes...also a lot of these mistakes wern't even mine that I got yelled at for.  On to another subject...I have another drivers training session tomorrow at noon. I hope it goes well and I don't scare the poor lady, who is by the way a very nice lady.  This falls under the religious catagory.  I would like to start a prayer chain on this blog, so if anyone would want to request prayer for anyone just email me and I will post it...or if you want to keep it under confidenciality, tell me that and I will pray for you personally.  I believe that's all for tonight.

      Well, last night was interesting. I went to band practice around 5ish. I sat at the piano as usual getting ready to play and one of the helpers there at church who is teaching us how to play instruments or improve our playing...And for the past couple of weeks I was playing the piano. This week the guy brings in a Bass, and might I say he truly is the show off type...And I am not exaggerating. Soooo he, who normally plays the guitar, tells me we are not having a piano player in this band and then he tells me to play the guitar. I told him I'd much rather play the piano, because it is much easier for me, even though I don't know how to read notes.  But he kept at me so I decided well, let him see for himself that I do much better on piano...  He then got on to me about how I play the guitar...Apparently that wasn't good enough for this guy, so then he takes the guitar back and gives me the bass. I have never played the bass before other than messing around doing nothing on it. So he started to teach me. I got the song 'Shout TO The Lord' down okay, but there was still room for improvement. I missed like one or two notes...just practicing and he says "what are you doing...its this one..."   By this time I was already getting a little upset at this guy, so before I blow up on him, I hand the bass to a different guy. At the end of all this I just ended up being a singer.  Tomorrow night is another practice...I guess I will have to see how it goes then...I will keep you guys posted on what goes on there.  Please pray for me through these stressful moments in time.  God Bless!

      I've only done maybe a couple posts actually about me...So I decided that I needed another one. Not much, but just a little more to get out there.   Quick review on childhood...   Born in Delano   Lived in Pond my  entire  life..well all 17 years of it I guess...not much of a life yet.  currently attending Baptist Temple Church of Delano right now...have been for pretty much my whole life too.  I'm going into my senior year of high school now. I have always hated school, just to let you know.  I've only ever had 1 boyfriend and it was in my freshman year.(Not a subject that ever comes up that often)  That may be because I don't do well with too many people. I am scared of relationships of any kind, even friends.  Any time I felt I was getting close to someone, I would freak out and do something weird and it would make them not want to keep in contact with me...Don't get me wrong, I do have some friends, but very seldom do I have one that is long lasting and to the point where I would tell them just about everything. Relationships are the type of thing that I need to get used to and work on...Especially if I want to find that special someone and not scare him off like I have been doing lately. I guess this is where people would tell me I am just scared of commitment...All I can say is Pray for me in this category.  Now off to sleep.

      Today I talked to an old time friend that I haven't talked to in a long time. It was nice, and I still have the same thoughts about him as I did a few years ago. He has changed quite a bit since I have met him...in the sense that he actually has a certain amount of respect now for people around him. For the most part he has been the friend that would call almost every day weather he was busy or not...Basically just to see what's up. He always carried the most part of the conversations, which was fine with me because if anyone knew me I don't carry a good conversation with many people. Nothing personal, just something I'm not good at.  Anyways I spent about two hours on the phone with him talking about many different subjects just catching up on life. We did have a little disagreement on some religious factors, but those are still in the making.   I never try to force the subject of religion on someone, but if they get me started then they better watch out because it is something that I take very seriously.  I think we ended up talking about swearing and how it is disrespectful. Well I thought it was disrespectful, but he had his point of view too...Swearing has always been something that I absolutely hated, and honestly I have no clue why. I get sooo mad sometimes when people swear in front of me that I just have to walk away or get into a different set of mind change, get right with myself and God before I can even talk to that person again...Its not that I rank myself higher than that person or even say that I am better because I don't swear...It's just truly disrespectful to me and makes me feel sick to my stomach. It also makes the person swearing look pretty stupid and just using those words to supposedly look "cool" or because he couldn't find any other word to use.  Yeah Yeah, I know I am ranting and raving, but that's probably what I do best. So please, next time you feel like swearing, don't, especially when your mad because that just proves you have an even greater weakness than the person your mad at.  I'm not asking anyone to change their entire life, just for some crazy girl named Beth, but to think next time you want to swear.  So now I am off to do something that I have no idea yet.   Good Bye and God Bless!!!

      Starting with  Sunday : After church, our family was greeted with my aunt, uncle and cousin from Oregon. It was nice to see my uncle in 8 years. That night, which was the fourth of July, we all went to my other cousins house in Bakersfield and watched a lot of fireworks from there.  Now  Monday : I went with my aunt and uncle to Dublin were we stayed in a nice hotel. We swam and went to a few shops and ate out at a nice Mexican restaurant...Might I say it was GOOD!!!   Tuesday : My uncle gave me a tour of the  Military base there in Dublin...That was the main reason we went to Dublin for his job. I got to see some cool looking dudes in uniform and met a really nice sergeant named Tadlock. He was one of the highest people in the chain of commanders. It was quite the experience.   Wednesday : I honestly can't remember what happened. But I do know that at 6:30pm I was in Wednesday night Bible study.   Thursday : Which would be today, was an interesting day. We started off by going and getting a good breakfast at Dennys. Then back home for an hour or so. Then back into town to work. I clean the church while people mowed the lawn. Twas a funny sight to see. Back home we went after that. Around 4:30pm we took off to Bakersfield to a really good friend of ours named Bob. It was for a Brithday party for me and my friend, Jennifer...Yeah yeah my birthday was the first and her's is tomorrow, but it took us three years to actually plan and have a birthday party together. So we all enjoyed beating up each other in the swimming pool that Bob gratefully let us use. Thank You Bob! Then back home I went again...twas a busy day, but fun ;)  Now it is time for email catching up to do and then sleep.

      Today was a relaxing day. I spent most of my time just resting, laying around the house. Then around 7pm, me and my family went to McFarland to watch the fireworks with a group of church friends. It was fun seeing a lot of people I haven't seen for quite a while.  One person that we really miss is a good friend Chuck. Especially my mom...She was going nuts saying how much she missed him and his commentaries about "Flaming Ash". LOL  All in all a good night, but just not the same with out Chuck.

      Well, I guess resting was out of the question, but me and my mom go a lot of work done around the house for visitors. My aunt from Oregon has decided to come over on the forth of July...I am not quite sure when she is leaving, but I know she will be here for at least one week.   A lot has been going on these past few weeks as you may have seen that I haven't been blogging....Blogging for me is just a place to go and write what I want, when I want, so it will release a bit of stress that I may get sometimes.  I'm not saying I am stressed right now, but it is relaxing just sitting here barely moving my fingers for no good reason at all.  All together, not a bad day and I hope to see more like it in the future. I am leaving on a happy note that sleep is a good thing...especially on your Birthday ;)  Have a good night!

      These past few days have been a little different. I spent the entire day at my church cleaning and around 5 we started to have our band practice. It was fun, but the good thing now is that me and that dude who was getting on my nerves before is now not and we are getting along just fine now...But a very long day none the less.  Monday was kind of a day that I spent here at the house all by myself again. Both of my parents work now so that means some days I spend time alone or with a friend.  Although I'm sure my friend likes to spend more time with her boyfriend then me, but who can blame her...I bet we all want that ; )  Today is another one of those days where I spend alone until 4:30. Then my dad gets here and we head of to the Bible Study on Wednesday nights...well I guess I forgot we have youth group again, so we will be cooking tonight with the youth....It shall be fun.  Now I am off to search the web again for some cool stuff.

      Get this...Me going to an actual slumber party : ) I'm 17 and my sisters fiances little boy, who is 6 years old, wanted to have a slumber party, but with older people. It was kinda fun, but it was something to laugh at. There were 4 over the age of 21...I guess it doesn't really matter when it's family, but we had a blast. We watched a movie, jumped on the trampoleen, then went swimming. After that is was junk food time.  Then this morning we all hopped into a car and went to church. A guy by the name of Grant preached today while we are still in search for a pastor. He was a really nice guy. The band that I am in, played today again. Boy did we rock on for Jesus. I also got to see my cousin and his new born baby today. They came over to visit from another state...It was nice to see them again for a new change.  Time to try to get some rest and then off to another Bible study tonight.

      Tonight was great...I went to my friends house to visit with her youth group again. That was something that I haven't done in about 5 weeks and everyone there was actually happy to see me again. We played volleyball and then had our devotional time with singing. Some people there even gave a small testimony of there past life...I might say that was a little hard to take. There are sooo many evil people in this word that need some faith and friends.  After that we played some more volleyball and talked. I love visiting at my friends house...I feel I could be myself there with out anyone judging me. It's also nice to talk with her brother Ben. He's a nice guy friend too. I would say they are the easiest people to talk to right now. Then at the end when Ben was going to take me home, I got to sit in the front seat, because it was packed with 4 other boys in the back seat. Me and him also had a good chat on the way home about Whitney and Mariah. They are great singers, but why did Whitney have to get into drugs?  Crazy people, but a great night.  Good night!

      Today my dad took the day off. Early this morning we put some pottery stuff together and put it in my kiln. Then went inside to fix the toilet. My dad always had me learning how to fix things, I guess it's a good thing in case if I get a guy who didn't know how to do anything. He's taught me how to fix different things in toilets, how to replace pumps and parts of coolers, and how to change the oil in my car. Not the typical girl, but it actually helps to know a few things and how to fix them...in the long run it helps save a lot of money too.  Right now my body aches, I haven't been able to sleep very well lately. I keep waking up all throughout the night at different times. Who knows I may be getting sick.  Another thing I have been doing lately is looking up info on Tsunami...It's a State Youth Conference that about 4,500 people go to. It's pretty awesome, but I don't think our youth may make it this year. We have to make around $2,000 just to pay for ALL expenses for about 15 people. This conference is in December, sooo if anyone wants to donate to Baptist Temple Church of Delano Youth feel free, you can email me if you have any more questions about it.  God Bless!

      Yesterday and today were those type of days where not everything may go wrong, but at times it seems that way. Have you ever felt like no matter what you did or said, no one would listen to you. I had so many suggestions that no one would even consider and it was really frustrating me...And for someone who usually doesn't put a lot of input in on some thing, it was very discouraging too. It seemed as if every thing I said was shot down immediately and not taken seriously....It was frustrating me enough to almost make me cry....Don't you just hate it when people don't pay any attention to you when you at least make the effort?  Other than all this other frustration, I had an ok day today with my mom...we even went to the movies and say a chick flick 'A Cinderella Story'. It was a cute movie.  Well time to go God Bless.
