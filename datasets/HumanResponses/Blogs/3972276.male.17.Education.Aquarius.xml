      Okay, so I haven't posted in a few days. Well there's a good explanation for that, I haven't been home. Well now I am so I've decided to write a little something. Since most of my posts are about the Cardinals, I decided to keep that trend going. Unfortunitly the Cards lost tonight 7-2, snapping a 5 game win streak. They played the Giants and Barry Bonds basically won the game. I think it was 3-0 and Suppan was still on the mound. I can't remember, but I believe the Giants had runners on first and third with maybe 1 or 2 out. I forget the exact situation, but you get the idea. Bonds came up and LaRussa decided to spot pitches carefully, but not intentionally walk Bonds. Sure I'm mad he hit the home run, but I hate it so much when people intentionally walk Bonds. Just go after him and if you miss a spot or he gets a hit, deal with it, that's what he's paid to do. So anyway, Suppan threw a fastball that was supposed to be outside, but instead just stayed right over the middle of the plate. Bonds crushed the ball into the seats in right field and the Giants went up 6-0. Oh well, shit happens. We'll get 'em tomorrow night. Tomorrow I'm going to see the Lion King on Broadway in New York. Should be fun I suppose, however it's a bus trip and a 4 hour one at that. I took a bus trip to Canada awhile back and that was hell. The seats are so uncomfortable and it's so boring. I'll just have to bring 4 hours worth of good music to listen to. Anyway I have nothing else to write so I'm going to bid you farewell. I'll write another update on Sunday I suppose about the trip. Hopefully all goes well. Later.

      I just looked at the Cardinals schedule in the month of July and realized they've only lost 2 games this month. Their record in July is 12-2. Isn't that awesome?? GO CARDS!

      What up yo? The Cardinals won again! 11-8. How deep is a team when So Taguchi comes up with a game tying home run off Farnsworth? Plus Pujols went 5-5 with 3 fucking home runs, which is SICK! Poor Cubbies. Now they're 10 games back in the division and have slipped into 3rd place behind the Reds. Honestly it's hard to say the Cards have won the division, because they haven't. There's so much baseball left it's insane, so I'm not counting any team out. However, that being said, it's all in the Cards hand's now. All they have to do is keep winning and they're set. I'm pretty excited about a postseason run. St. Louis hasn't been in the playoffs since 2001 when they lost in the NLDS to the Arizona Diamondbacks. As any baseball fan would know, Arizona was lead by Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson that year and went on to beat the Yankees to win the World Series in seven games. Yes, back then I was also a Yankees fan. I have nothing against the Yankees, I just hate Steinbrenner and don't agree with him just running out and buying every big name player. The Cardinals have tons of stars and you might think I'm a hypocrite because of that, but the Yankees payroll is $180 while the Cards only spend $80. It just isn't fun to root for a team that can buy whoever they need to win. When I was a fan back in '95 they were a team on the rise and much more of an underdog. But whatever. I'm a Cardinals fan for life. Seeing as I've been called a bandwagon fan on many occasions, you can quote me on saying I'll be a St. Louis Cardinals fan forever. What else is new? The WSOP (World Series of Poker) is on tonite. I love poker and I love watching it on ESPN. Poker isn't really a sport, it's more of a game like chess. Like any sport, it takes talent to play poker or chess. Sure much of the time in poker you rely on luck, but these guys take calculated risks for the most part. I personally think poker is great. Ok, I'm done for now.

      Well I'm in a fantastic mood so I've decided to make another entry into this here blog. The Cardinals won their 3rd game in a row beating the Cubs tonite 5-4. I really don't like the Cubs. I'm not a fan of Dusty Baker, Sammy Sosa, or Moises Alou so there really isn't much incentive to like them. Plus you have to factor in the fact that they're the Cards most hated rival, so yeah I don't like them much. The game looked awesome on paper and man did it deliever. Zambrano vs. Carpenter was an awesome pitching duel. Carpenter is like a younger Matt Morris. Before Morris had arm surgery, he threw in the mid 90s. Carpenter throws in the mid 90s now, plus he has a sick breaking ball. Morris now has to rely more on control and his curve. The Cards really got a good deal with Carpenter when they picked him up from the Jays. This kid is going to be awesome when you pair him with Marquis. However, Zambrano is a total asshole. I'll admit the guy has talent, but he's way too fucking emotional. He gets out of control. Seriously, what pitcher has the nerve to hit a batter and then talk shit to him when he hits a home run? Plus to add insult to injury, Zambrano hit Edmonds again in the 8th after he gave up the 2 run go ahead home run to Rolen, the previous batter. I was pissed. I love Edmonds and I would have just kicked Zambrano's ass, but being the class act that he is, Edmonds just walked it off. Props to Jimmy. Rolen, my fucking hero, won another game for the Cards by smashing a ball to get back the lead for good. Anyway, the Cardinals are now 9 games up on the Cubs after they gained a full game with the win tonite. I'm not worried about the Brewers or the Reds, who will be much more of a threat next year. Plus the Stros aren't bonding well and Williams was fired, so they're done. Well if the Cards beat the Cubs again tomorrow the season series is done and they'll have a 10 game lead for the division. I seriously have to question what the fuck the schedule man was smoking when he went to work this season. How can the Cubs and Cards be done playing each other in July? That's a travesty. Oh yeah, I watched RAW tonight. Sadly I'm still a wrestling fan as most people just abandoned the fad years ago. I don't know what it is, but for some reason I'm still a fan. Despite the fact the product is becoming increasingly shitty, I love Chris Benoit as champion and Chris Jericho is my hero, as my s/n would indicate. I got bored though and didn't watch the IC title match between Randy Orton and Edge. I hate Orton and Edge is a bad IC champ. Edge will retain, probably by a DQ with interference from Evolution. It's sad that I know that isn't it? Oh well. Anyway that's it for now. I don't even think anyone reads this shit so I don't feel like writing anymore. Later.

      Seeing as the summer has proved to be more boring than I could have imagined, I have decided to create this online blog to keep me from dying of boredom. I don't see any point in writing a blog, but since I have nothing else to do I figure it should eat up some time. Today is Monday. I recently bought NCAA Football 2005 for the Gamecube thinking it was going to be a great game. However, after playing the game for about 2 days I realized the game sucks. Honestly, I think watching a rock would be more fun than playing this game. As a big fan of the series I'm incredibly dissapointed. Fuck you EA Sports. Oh man, I've been watching "I Love the 90s" on VH1 all weekend. That shit is fucking hilarious! I watched the entire decade from 90 to 99. I never watched the 70s or 80s, but now I wish I had. That show is so great, I recommend that anyone who hasn't seen it should check it out ASAP. Just don't buy those dumbass "I Love the 70s, 80s, or 90s" CDs. If you really want the songs, just go on Kazaa or something. That's it for now. I'm surprised I wrote that much. Go me.
