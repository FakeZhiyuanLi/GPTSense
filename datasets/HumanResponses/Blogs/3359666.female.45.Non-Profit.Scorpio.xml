      If certain world famous performers had auditioned on today's  American Idol  first, I believe they would have been severely demoralized and gone on to pursue a different line of work altogether because of Simon. Here are some of the caustic evaluations that Simon might've given the participants. If you use a really sarcastic British accent while reading this, it will make it even better.     Michael Jackson and Bubbles performing "I'm Bad."   Simon:  Mr. Jackson, not only are you bad, but you are truly dreadful. First of all, your octave range is too high, there's too much crotch grabbing between you and your chimp, you're dressed like a circus ringmaster, and you appear to have Tourette's Syndrome because you keep repeating hee hee and making other inappropriate noises and gestures. Is the circus in town because it would appear that one of their acts is missing. Could someone please call them to come pick up these two? Next!    Britney Spears singing and dancing to "Oops, I Did It Again."   Simon:  Miss Spears, it would seem that you have a future as an exotic dancer. Your voice sounds rather childlike and yet not unlike that of a phone sex provider. Your dance moves are all rather predictable. Shuffle to the right, bend over and let your hair fall forward right along with your breasts, turn around fall backwards into your man posse, and then bend over and stare at the audience from between your legs. That is a big oopsie! You should leave immediately and go straight to the Playboy Mansion. You obviously have a career waiting for you there. Next!    Prince and The Revolution sing "Little Red Corvette."   Simon:  Prince, you are way too short, too ethnic looking, too scrawny, and Your Revolution is revolting. You remind me of a pint-sized Tiny Tim with all that screeching and caterwalling that you call singing. Purple is for Barney. You will never make it in this industry. Next!    Madonna and The Boy Toys.   Simon:  Madonna, first let me just say that I have never seen anything quite as eccentric as your singing whore drama. You, also, need to choose a hair color and stick with it. Your voice is quite good, but your choice of songs containing religious content is unfortunate. No one will buy your records. I doubt that you will find anyone in the entire world who would agree to sign a contract with you. You're a major loser. Next!      Snoop Dog rapping about something.   Simon:  Snoopie, I must say that out of all the contestants that have appeared before me, I have never heard singing quite like yours. Unfortunately, I have no idea what your songs are about or what you are saying when you sing them. You really need to do some work on your look. Your hair is a nightmare, you're way too thin, and your nose reminds me of a ski slope. If you were to work on your pronunciation and make the improvements I've mentioned, you might have a chance in the music business. Next!    Marilyn Manson singing "Disposable Teens."   Simon:  Miss Manson, your look is too bizarre, your clothing is deranged, and you need to lose the evil eye contact lenses and teeth hardware. The corset and fishnet stockings detract from your singing. If you want to succeed, please choose a gender and stick with it. That will be all for today.

      Captain Bubba was going over the City Crime Log and there were several entries that made him wonder if perhaps the full moon hadn't risen during the night. He usually circled the date for that time of the month because that's when all the loons started circling. In order, the complaints were listed as follows:   01:37 a.m. Man reportedly knocking on doors and breaking windows on entire block of  North Dixie. He was picked up and taken in for evaluation by the veterinarian because the doctors don't like to be disturbed when they're sleeping.   06:32 a.m. A woman was heard yelling at children and causing problems by a neighbor who turned her in.  Take that Gladys, you old goat.   06:53 a.m. An unattended flock of black sheep were all out grazing on the side of Hwy 127. Nobody in this town will eat mutton, so the owner was contacted pronto.   07:00 a.m. Three ATV's were reportedly stolen in the 300 block of Tell.  07:15 a.m.  Three ATV's were reportedly terrorizing the neighborhood over on Tempest Street which is exactly three blocks from the 300 block of Tell. They could be related to the ATV theft. Have Buford check on it.   08:00 a.m.  A woman showed up at the local hospital with a white powdery substance on her lips; scratching all over, and acting very agitated. They think she may have gotten into some tainted powdered sugar doughnuts and is on a sugar rush.   09:00 a.m.  A strange man was sitting in a strange car outside a house on Filmore Street. The woman caller demanded that someone come over quick before he does anything strange.    10:00 a.m. A very large dog was attacking patrons as they tried to enter the City Library on Cherry Street. It had managed to pull the pants off of one Daisy Tatum and she was airlifted to the nearest Walmart to replace them. The dog was last seen laying under a mimosa tree chewing up several Dr. Phil books.   10:42 a.m. Becky Benson called to report that her ex-boyfriend was threatening to set his truck on fire on the corner of Pecan and Peanut Ave. if she didn't come back to him.  11:15 a.m. Donny McDonald was reportedly working a herd of cattle when he lost his cell phone. He wanted to know if Officer Buford could bring Bolivar to help locate it without spooking the herd.    Captain Bubba closed the log and went in search of Buford and Bolivar. He found them both out back playing catch the robber. It was almost time for lunch so they stopped and the three of them went to lunch at the usual greasy spoon. Today was fried liver and onion day, so Buford asked for an extra large doggie bag for Bolivar.   It was relatively quiet for the rest of the afternoon until around 7 p.m. when a call came in from the security guard at the local movie theater. Some second graders were getting rowdy, so Officer Buford went over to talk to them and/or throw them out. When he arrived, they were all out of their seats, throwing buttered popcorn all over everyone, and using foul language. Officer Buford told them to sit down and watch the movie or he'd make them leave and they wouldn't get their money back either. The spokesperson for the group said,  Fuck you, we don't have to listen to you!  REALLY!? The security guard and Officer Buford decided to load up little Fuck You Freddie in the patrol car.   Office Buford drove him home to have a talk with his parents. Freddie wasn't worried at all and kept shouting obscenities from the back of the patrol car. Bolivar had been left at the station by accident. Buford sure wished he had remembered to bring him. Officer Buford got out of the patrol car and knocked on the door. A man opened the front door/porch screen combo and then stared at them waiting for someone to speak.   Officer:  We have your son, Freddie, here. He's been creating a disturbance at the movie theater and I'm afraid I'm going to have to take him in unless you agree to make sure he stays in the house for the rest of the evening .  Father:  Now, lookee here, Officer, we didn't even know the boy was gone and frankly we're tired of him. It was so nice and quiet around here that me and his momma were getting along real good if you know what I mean .  Officer:  So, are you willing to keep him in for the night ?  Father:   Nah, why don't you go ahead and keep him so we can enjoy ourselves for once.   With that the father slammed the door shut and it looked like Buford and Freddie were going to be stuck with each other.   Buford didn't feel like babysitting someone else's problem so he decided to take Freddie back to the theater and see if he could figure out what to do when he got there. Upon arrival, they were greeted by the theater security guard and the smell of burning garbage. It seems that Fuck You Freddie's friends had decided to set the outside theater dumpster on fire. It was then that Officer Buford realized that he and Bolivar would be spending the night at the City Jail with a whole group of second graders behind cell bars. Captain Bubba requested a written report and then he bid them all a good night before leaving.   Psst.... Sadly, this story is based on actual events and there are other Freddies out there.

      BEING MEAN TAKES A LOT of energy and dedication. I can handle all that, but planning the strategies to make it all happen without a glich are so tedious. I'm pretty sure that in a past life I was a member of Genghis Khan's posse. I love the way they are portrayed on South Park and I always wondered what the wrath of Khan actually was. I also wondered about the Mongol Horde. Apparently, Genghis had a strict philosophy regarding dealing with the enemy. He believed that he was the Pez punishment dispenser for God. You either surrendered or he would annihilate you, all your peeps, cats, yaks, camels, orchards, dogs, vineyards, and anything else you owned or might need in order to survive. He would sweep through your village leaving only a small pile of ashes.   Genghis and all the Mongols loved their horses. They were put on horseback before age 3. Each Mongol owned four to five horses. Most of them rode mares because of the delicious milk they produced. I would like to think that they all had a small stool and used a pail to milk their mares, but I have a feeling that this was not the Mongol way. I will leave you to your own visual imaginings. Mare's milk was very high in vitamin C which kept away the scurvy burvies. On some occasions, the rider would cut the horse's veins and drink the blood that spurted forth. If the horse died, they died; if it lived, they survived. Mare's milk could be made into a yummy fermented substance called kumiss which was also an alcoholic beverage. There's nothing worse than a bunch of Mongols drunk on horse milk. That's when things really got out of hand. You know how guys can be when intoxicated. A group of the guys lied and told the Chinese behind the walled city of Xixia that they would go away only if they would send them every cat and bird they had. After they gathered about a thousand of them, Genghis had his men tie bits of cloth to their tails and then set the cloths on fire. The cats and birds fled back to the city and ended up setting off hundreds of bonfires inside the city. While the Chinese were busy stomping out said fires, Genghis and his thundering horde rode in for the attack and destroy mission. His favorite method was to line up each and every villager and than let his men shoot them with arrows as his final act of gotcha.   Genghis had a whole arsenal of dirty tricks. His favorite method was to put fear in the hearts of anyone who wasn't part of his empire. Just knowing that the Mongols were on their way to a city near them put the fear of Buddha into any villager's heart. The original Mongols were professional warriors and had to study at the war academy before being sent out on the road show. These guys knew what they were doing and had some plays that would make the best football coach look like a rank amateur.   Here are some of their favorite moves:   Genghis loved this one because it was his patented move and yet the enemy fell for it each and every time no matter where he might roam. No one was ever left alive to tell just how he pulled it off. Genghis would run a test attack on the enemy, retreat to an undisclosed location, and when the enemy followed them to make sure they had indeed run them off, the Mongols would ambush the enemy by attacking them from both sides and also sneaking up behind them. It was like a Custer's last stand spectacle except Custer was still just a possibility in God's little pantry of things to come. They were quicker than a premature ejaculation.   Genghis had state of the art equipment too.  His men used giant leather shields to attack from behind or they would use their POW's for human shields. No use in dragging around more baggage than they had to. He also had catapults which could throw large spears, rocks, and battering rams into city walls. He used Goliath sized ladders to scale enemy walls if it came to it. Whoopee!! Then there were the gunpowder missiles and my personal favorite-the catapult of burning oil. Mmmmmm.....shock and awe, 1200 AD style.  Genghis was a man who loved his work. For four days, he waged war against a city of 10,000 people. When the smoke cleared every human, cat, and dog was dead and he was satisfied. I don't understand why he had to involve the cats and dogs in his death campaigns. I guess there was no Humane Society for anybody to send a complaint scroll to.   The life of a Mongol Warrior was most difficult because they virtually lived on their horses and owned several so they could swap them out. Most of them even slept on their horses so they could be ready to go at a moment's notice. He who had the fastest horse lived the longest. They carried cooking pots, dried meat, yogurt, water bottles, and others essentials for long journeys in their saddlebags.   I wonder how often the Warrior came home and what that homecoming scene was like back at the yert? The Mongolian Princess would be all freshly bathed and dressed in her finest after preparing a meal of fish or some small game animal with yogurt, onions and fresh berries for dessert while she waited for her man to come greet her and feast. Her warrior/husband would stagger in all narsty and stinking of horse sweat with kumiss on his breath insisting that he was going to nail her before eating or doing anything else. After the hasty welcome home, the Mongolian Princess would weep quietly as he ate and watch as he staggered back outside to spend the night with his horse as was his custom. Remember, when I told that the Mongols really loved their horses? What I really meant was that the Mongols were in love with their horses. The Princess just didn't smell quite right and she had no body hair to keep him warm at night so he followed his heart.  Copyright© 2004 Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      THE DAY HAD STARTED out bad. Bolivar had arrived today so that meant that Officer Buford would be busy  bonding  with the new police dog all day. Bolivar was a very tall German Shepherd with peircing brown eyes. Captain Bubba guessed that Bolivar wouldn't be worth killing after Buford and his kids spoiled him rotten. So far there had been several complaints called in and Captain Bubba was documenting them one by one.   7:00 a.m.  Three brown cows out on Hwy 243.      8:15 a.m.  Unknown individual reportedly bucked off of a Brahma bull. Patient transferred to The Sister's of No Mercy Hospital.      9:00 a.m.  Neighborhood dog reportedly killing ducks in the park on Hwy 64.     9:30 a.m.  Patient reportedly fighting off nurses at Shady Acres Nursing Home.   10:45 a.m. Ex-spouse charged with criminal trespass at 1200 Empress Drive.  11:20 a.m. Man yelling out on Rocky Top Road.  1:41 p.m. Officer requested in reference to a kitty cat up a tree.  2:30 p.m. Juvenile reportedly crying on porch at 1200 Empress Drive.   4:47 p.m. Ex-criminal trespass -spouse returned to 1200 Empress Drive. Suspect arrested and booked.  6:32 p.m. Woman reportedly driving through bar ditch on Merryville Mountain Road.  This last entry worried Captain Bubba so he and Buford decided to drive on over and see if they could pick her up. Buford insisted on bringing Bolivar  just in case  anything happened. The Captain hated the feel of that beast's hot breath on the back of his neck as they cruised the highway looking for their perp. Bolivar was here to stay, so what could he do except adjust?    Captain Bubba and Officer Buford started following a car that was obviously out of control as it wandered back and forth between three lanes of traffic. On the back glass was a emblem that said:  Jesus had to die. Ask me why.  The Captain ascertained that perhaps it had something to do with the female occupant having Jesus in the passenger seat at one time when they had a head on collision or she had run HIM down on the highway. Either way, she must've been the reason Jesus had to die. Was this her way of confessing? The officers finally got the vehicle pulled over and Captain Bubba approached it cautiously. The driver was a 90 year old woman wearing very thick glasses. It took her twenty minutes just to find her drivers license. She finally held it out in her leathery, gnarled hand and gave it to Officer Buford. He gave her a Breathalyzer test which she passed, but they did issue a ticket for reckless driving. Buford was itching to question her, but they had to let her go. She was a menace on the streets, but there was no DNA evidence to prove that she had  any involvement regarding Jesus and why he had to die. Bolivar just walked around pissing on all four of her tires.  Marking it for evidence  is what Buford called it as he laughed so hard he almost pissed in his own pants. They were done and as they were heading back, Officer Buford asked the Cap if he would mind stopping at Dottie's Jolly Cone, so he could buy some ice cream for Bolivar. Captain Bubba was already in a mood and decided that a chocolate dipped cherry ice cream cone might be just the remedy, so he turned left and headed that way. He was kind of sweet on Dottie anyway.

      Captain Bubba was more than a little annoyed with Officer Buford. It seems that Buford had caught Bubba in the midst of a busy day which caused the Captain to sign a request for a police dog without looking it over first. He'd just received a memo that they had a dog that really hadn't made the grade for search and rescue, but he would do just fine for their needs.   Captain Bubba:   Buford!!  Officer Buford:  Yes, sir, has someone called in another case cause as soon as I'm done eating my steak finger basket with fries I'll be ready to go.  Captain Bubba:   Buford, did you order a police dog without discussing it with me first?   Officer Buford:   Well, now I could have. I don't rightly remember. Why? Are we getting a dog?   Captain Bubba:   Yes, we are getting a dog that the department cannot afford and where in the hell did you think we were going to keep this mutt!!!??   Officer Buford:  Well, sir, my kids have been awanting a dog and I figured he'd just live with us when he wasn't here at work. I already got a name picked out for him and everything.   Captain Bubba was thinking up ways to torture Buford like a prisoner of war, but he decided against it.  Captain Bubba:   And what name did you have in mind?   Officer Bubba:   Well, sir, I wanted to name him after my dearly departed grandpappy Bolivar. Is he here yet?   Captain Bubba:   The dog arrives at 0800 hours tomorrow and you better have a leash and a collar for Bolivar. Also, you will buy his food out of your salary. Do we understand each other?   Officer Buford:  Oh, yes sir. Wait til I tell the wife and kids that Bolivar is on his way. I've gotta stop by the Walmart and get Bolivar some toys and things like that.  Captain Bubba:   I don't think he's that kind of dog, Buford.    Their case of the day had just been reported. Someone had placed a menacing ad in the local newspaper. It read: I know who you are. You dug up my white rose bush and stole it. I saw you do it and I have authorized someone to deal with you.    Captain Bubba had Buford go check out the two local nurseries and Walmart to see if any white rose bushes had been sold recently. Buford was gone an awfully long time so Captain Bubba called him on his squawk box. No answer. Buford came back in half an hour later carrying a large sack from Walmart. The look on Captain Bubba's face told him he better put the sack in his pickup and give him his report. He told the Captain that there had been only one white rose bush sold in the whole town during the last year to a Miss Zinnia Parkins. She was a retired school teacher who'd sniffed way too much glue over the years and was one eggroll shy of a full poo poo platter.  Captain Bubba and Officer Buford decided to drive over and question Zinnia. She freely admitted that she had written the ad and placed it in the local newspaper under Miscellaneous. When asked who the perp was, she said she really didn't know, but that she'd just said she did to scare whoever took her rosebush. The two officers asked to be shown the scene of the crime. She took off her apron and led them outside to an empty space beneath the bedroom window. Sure enough there was nothing left, but some landscaping plastic with ornamental rocks strewn around on top of it. They asked her if she'd mind if they walked around the rest of the house looking for clues. She said,   Of course, officers, do whatever it takes.   Both officers headed to the back of the house to see if they could find any footprints or anything else out of place. Officer Buford was the first to find something and he called Captain Bubba over to investigate. There stood a white rosebush out by the back of the house.   Officer Buford:  That there sure looks like a white rosebush to me, Captain.   Captain Bubba:   Yep, that's what it is alright. I suppose Miss Zinnia is losing her mind.  Officer Buford:  What are we gonna do, Cap?   Captain Bubba:   There's nothing we can do except arrest her and let it go to trial.   Zinnia Parkins was arrested for falsely reporting a theft and taken in for fingerprinting and processing. A hearing and a short trial followed the next week. She was found innocent by reason of senility and let go with a warning and a year's probation.   Copyright© 2004 Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      Captain Bubba and Buford had just received a frantic 911 call from a woman who stated that someone had put a diaper out on her back porch and she didn't even have a baby. After they removed the suspicious diaper and threw it in the trash for her, they got a disturbing call that a body had just been found right off of Hwy 666. They flicked on the bubble top, the siren, and sped off going 90 mph. This was the fifth body that had been found in less than a month and everyone was convinced that they had a serial killer on their hands. As they pulled up, all the highway patrolmen, sheriffs, local police officers, Canadian Mounted Police, and Texas Rangers were already there working the case. The EMT's had already done all they could, but they were standing by the ambulance to watch and learn from the CSI masters. Captain Bubba spotted a long black sedan with tinted windows parked well away from the crowd and knew that the FBI had been called in as well. He tipped his sweat-stained hat in their direction just to say   Howdy   before he joined the others.   When everyone saw Captain Bubba and Buford get out of the car, they immediately stopped what they were doing and waited to see what the Roadkill CSI could uncover that would help them solve this case. As the two men approached the vic, they couldn't help but gag on the awful smell. Captain Bubba kept telling Buford to breathe through his mouth so he wouldn't be so nauseated. They both covered their faces with surgical masks, snapped on a pair latex gloves; squatted down to examine the vic and look for any evidentiary material. The vic laid on it's side with it's tongue hanging out and it's innards scattered all over the pavement. Although they couldn't be sure, they thought this might be a vehicular manslaughter case. No premeditation. A man would have to be a danged fool to kill something like this on purpose. Identification of the deceased was easily determined. It was a  carnivorous Mustelidae  or pole-cat. Captain Bubba couldn't spell that so he just wrote down skunk. Buford went to work on evidence collection and making casts of tire prints and such.   Animal control was called and they scraped the evidence off of the hot blacktop and placed it into a  special plastic bag,  for it's final ride to the morgue. An autopsy was performed on the vic and Captain Bubba's instincts proved to be correct. It was definately a cold blooded hit and run by an unknown vehicle. They were lucky and found a single metallic purple paint chip on the body. It was later identified as coming from a 1998 Puma SUV. Finding the perp was going to be a difficult task considering that they still hadn't solved the other four cases. Nobody in town owned a vehicle matching that description. Maybe the killer had moved out of the area.   Captain Bubba held a news conference on CNN and assured everyone that everything that could be done was being done. He asked for their patience and advised them not to panic. Just as he had finished anwering all the reporters' questions, someone handed him a note that another body had been found on old Hwy 140. This time the perpetrator had changed his MO. The Captain tried to keep it from the press for now and he walked back to his car. Buford came out of Starbucks carrying two Vanilla Frappucinos to perk them up after all the drama.  Captain Bubba:  Thanks for the drink, boy. Listen, I hate to spoil things, but we've got another body and this time it's different. Officer  Buford:     Oh, Lordee, don't tell me that he's switched over to something larger now like a deer. I promised my boy that I'd take him hunting this year and if this serial killer kills all the deer then there won't be any left for me and my boy to kill. What are we gonna do?  Buford was totally overwrought.  Captain Bubba:  Drink your frappuccino, Buford. It's not a deer. The new vic is a  possum.  We'll just have to set up a stakeout and watch for that Purple Puma to show up so we can arrest the perp.   Officer Buford:  Well, okay. You're the boss.    Captain Bubba watched Buford as he busied himself with his swirly straw and concentrated on enjoying his drink. Captain Bubba decided to do the same, but the whole time he was thinking what a  culo  Buford was. For those of you who are Spanglish impaired, that would be asshole in Englais.

      THE CREATOR WAS BORED one day so he decided to cook up a little something, well,  different . The dinosaurs were very interesting and all, but The Creator wanted something that wouldn't go out of existence.  What to do? What to do?  Finally, a plan materialized and The Creator went to work on his new masterpeice. Here is the recipe.   Platypus Ingredients  1 otter body 1 fur pelt 1 duck bill 2 regulation eyeballs 1 tail of a beaver 2 webbed forefeet 4 reptilian claws 1 opening for mating, birth, and elimination 1 sonar radar for detection of electrical currents 2 sharp Plover spurs to inject poisonous venom  Just for fun he added some special effects like having this mosaic mammal lay leathery eggs instead of giving live birth. After much deliberation and meetings with the Archangels, he decided that the Platypus should live  only  in the rivers of Tasmania and eastern Australia where it remains thus, even today.   The Creator chuckled as he thought about how this would really stump scientists for eons as the platypus would never have a logical place in the evolutionary tree. It would drive em nutz!!!! The aborigines, however, delighted in the platypus and gave it a place of honor in their Dreamtime stories.  Copyright© April 2004. All International Rights Reserved. Catnip Clemens.

      Has anyone ever seen whale poo? If so, how many fathoms deep is it?   Why are cows fat? They're vegetarians.   Why did Yoko's Plastic Ono Band really split up? Was it John's constant meddling?   If every weird creature on earth tastes just like chicken, then why did God bother making chickens at all?      What do they do with the male Holstein cows since they have no teats?   Does Britney Spears poop out little pink heart-shaped turds?  Can they taxidermy people? Roy Rogers had Trigger stuffed and he's on display in the Roy Rogers Museum. Why not throw Roy in too? I mean they were so close and all.  I have six cats and I smell cat shit. Should I investigate?      Will Michael Jackson leave his skin to the Vitiligo Foundation?   Do bears still shit in the woods or have they started using the public facilities in the National Parks?

      I find some of the font names to be amusing in an understated way.  The font name I am currently using sounds like a country and western song. Verdana, Verdana, my heart's on fire for Verdana.  I have blissfully forgotten the words to the original song or even who sing, sang, or sung it.  Here are some more:    Abadi MT: medical tech who is not equipped to deal with a sick hamster, but he is determined to help as you lay dying on the side of the highway. Andale: a new breed of racing dog. Bermuda Solid: unfortunately there are still bits of flotsam floating around the Bermuda Triangle which have never sunk after all these years. Dom Casual: Gap's new line of men's  comfy  pants.     Eraser Dust:  YOU  could be caught by teacher. ET Astro: special linguistics used by Astrologers who channel E.T.'s. Geo Slab: brand new blog site that I hear is fabulous. New Zurica: a new island that rose out of the sea near Africa in 2001.  Plump MT: don't use this or people will think you are morbidly obese.  Space Toaster: use this and  you are  toast. Subway: unless you are Jerrod or plan to write graffiti on the subway walls stay away from this one. Tahoma: sounds like  vibes  from the future when Texas and Oklahoma will become one big state. I've visited both of them, so it's okay with me if they wanna do that.  Tempus Sans: the state of sadly being without the ability to follow a tempo.  TW Cen: that new rap group I've heard about. TypoUpright: a hangover antidote so you can still sit upright and type at work the next day.  Unicorn: a little too pointy and elusive for me.   Vixar: you are  way too easy .    Zapfhumst: probably some kind of serious bug spray for under your sink or the inside of your walls and shit like that.  Copyright 2004. All International Rights Reserved.

      I wish the authorities would investigate Mr. McFeelie of the late Mr. Roger's Show. I never trusted him and now I'm worried that the puppets may have been molested.    I wish that all celebrities who are accused of being gay by the media would quietly admit that indeed they are and then laugh in the rag mag reporter's face because it took him so long to figure it out.   I wish they would resurrect the broadway play Jesus Christ Superstar and that the part of Jesus would go to none other than Marilyn Manson.   I wish the court would order Michael Jackson to spend thirty days inside a plexiglass box wearing only a speedo thong sans body makeup, so we can all see just how speckled his body really is. After that, he should be flown to Japan; forced to dress in full Geisha attire at all times and entertain everyone in a Japanese sushi house for the rest of his life.   I wish all the reality shows would dissappear and give the surreal shows a turn. I must say The Littlest Bachelor came very close, but they didn't add enough symbology or melting clock faces to make it really surreal.   I wish they would give all the mad cows some Lithium, some Xanax, and then send them to an anger management seminar so we could continue to eat them.  I wish they would bring that Nazi to justice who thought using pregnant mare's urine in a pill for hormone replacement therapy was a good idea. I would never drink a glass of horse piss and now I feel guilty about all the ponies who had to wear catheters for the big urine collection.   I wish that my cat would not use my right hip as a surf board when I am trying to sleep. No matter how I twist, turn, or tumble during the night, she manages to hang on.   I wish Dubya would stop trying to hide behind Condi's skirts and would be a man and say, "Yep, I did it and if you don't like it tough titty." That is what he really thinks you know.  I wish Dr. Fatkins was still alive, so I could e-mail him a screaming flamer. He has made grocery shopping impossible. Where in the hell is the real food that I, an ex-Atkins dieter, am supposed to eat? I heard (for real) that the potato farmers were going tits up because nobody will come near their taters due to fear of carbs. I am not going to eat things containing tofu byproducts. Give me real carbs or give me death.   Copyright© 2004 by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved   My Top Ten Wishes

      My mind wanders these days because of the Minnow Paws and this is where it goes.   Did Hitler's mum bake him cookies and read him bedtime stories?  Why won't we let dead celebrities go? Perhaps they should have a new reality show called "Dead Celebrities." They could televise an open casket funeral and then we'd all have closure which would cut down on all the consipiracy theories and Elvis-type sightings.   Why did the ancients think the world was flat? Could they not look up into the night sky and see that the moon was round and figure it out?  	 Why did it take me two more years to figure out that the Easter Bunny was a big lie after I'd already found out that Santa was a hoax? Sadly, this is a true story.   Why is the Vatican swimming in opulence, if the Catholic Church is a non-profit organization and they have all taken a vow of poverty?  Why was Hitler busy building a master race of blonde-haired, blue-eyed Aryans and yet he had brown hair and eyes? Why create a club you can't join?   If Attila The Hun and Genghis Khan had a full-blown smackdown, who would win?   Since we can never see the dark side of the moon, what do you think is really	going on over there? I secretly suspect that the aliens are using it to hide from us. They grew weary of all our sissy whining about the anal probing.  Why does everyone keep falling for Oprah's latest weight loss find? Why doesn't she just hire someone to follow her around and slap the chips out of her hands?   Why is there now a sanitary pad with wings for women who wear thong underwear? They come in a triangular shaped small box. I saw them with my own eyes. What's next? The thongpon?  Why did the rock group KISS decide to take off their makeup and then continue to wear the creepy outfits?   Why don't dogs and cats ever have outie belly buttons instead of all innies?  Who coined the phrase "loose as a goose"? After giving it careful study, I found it is not the geese. It's the ducks.                             What does the bogey man actually do? I've never seen him, but I would think that maybe he comes for the boogars of small children to add to his boogar museum.  			 			  Copyright© 2004 by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      I went to the big clinic to see what wuz the matter with me the other day. Thay told me to take off all my clothes and then thay give me some lil ole tissue gown to wear instead. I wuz already suspicious of them folks when some man I never seen before in my whole born days comes in claiming to be a doctor and he starts touching my boombas and inspectin my hoo hah. I got whut the doctor calls the minnow paws. When I first heard about it, I stood straight up in those metal stirrups, screaming at them nurses to " GET EM OFF, GET EM OFF OF ME ." They jest stood there like thay didn't know what I wuz talkin bout. Then that feller claiming to be a doctor had his girls hold me down and strap me back onto that cold metal table I'd been alayin on.  Oh, he tried to explain all about why he had molested my hoo haw and boombas and how I needed to take some special pills. Special pills, heh? I bet they're poison just so's they kin shut me up. Said one of them pills was made outta pony piss and I wuz afeard to ask about the uther one. No how, I'd want to take enything like that there. Then he wanted to know if I wanted geenairic or brand. I knew I couldn't stand to have them brand me, so I chose geenairic. I was told to take that paper nightie off and put my own clothes back on. I guess it was so's I wouldn't be able to alert the other ladies in the big room awaiting their turn.   I was lead out of there by one of them nurses and she made me go see another woman so I could pay em. I'm purty shur she was the Madame.  PAY YOU ! I said.  I thought men were supposed to pay a woman if they looked at her hoo hah and touched her boombas. My bill was $175.00 and it took away ever penny of my whole life savins.    I gotta go now and explain all this to Buford without him suspecting that I wuz the one who give him the minnow paws. Hell, he probably already knows he has it and which lil ole girlie give it to em. As for the pony piss, I think I know how I kin make sum of my own out back in the old still. Wonder if I should use the mare or the stallion..........  Copyright©2004.

      MY SON KC IS always late with my Mother's Day gift, but they are worth waiting for. We go shopping together via his cell phone and I help him choose said gift. He started an Italian charm bracelet for me last year. Every time there is an occasion, he buys another charm. I still have my original charm bracelet from the 1960's Jurassic Age. The New Era charm bracelet consists of silver links with images soldered on them although they do have some charms called danglers. Gone are the jingley, jangley bracelets of yesteryear.  Apparently, he stumbled into an uber cache of Italian charms because we pawed through everything for well over an hour. He would describe each one to see if I thought I might like it. That is just phase one in the whole process. After the purchase, we then go in search of an envelope to mail them in where more choices have to be made. Colored or manila envelope; with or without padding? Phase two starts and it's off to yet another mall to purchase the now defunct Mother's Day card. Since it is May 19th, there are no cards left. Not a problem because just next door is the the Fuck card store I have come to love. I don't think that's it real name, but it's a place where one can find an abundance of narsty cards with truly unique and obscene messages inside. The card will be a surprise, but I do know which charms I'm getting. He and I share a love of "South Park" so a Cartman charm is in the box along with the others. He did have to explain to me that "South Park" was for adults and not kids before I would agree to watch it the first time.  Just when I think everything has been done that can be done, I receive the phase three phone call. I don't know why it should even surprise me anymore, but it does. He calls to ask for my address like he has no idea where I live. Usually, he is standing in line at the post office addressing it all. I can overhear the entire transaction and then he gives me the confirmation number, so that I can track my package. Usually, the gift arrives before it's even entered into the computer. I figure that by Saturday I will be sitting around with my jewelers tools adding the new links. After this one is full, we're gonna start a second one.  Well, PT just came home with a box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts and placed them on my desk. I wonder what he's been up to. Has to be something financial because although he has his faults and I have mine, the usual dirty tricks would be totally out of character for him. Money and food are his vices. He better not have bought another "rust bucket" in need of total restoration. Guess, I'll find out sooner or later. Maybe he just loved my tongue lashing at lunch so much that he felt compelled to give me a present. I'm sure that's it. If I'd been sweet to him, then there would've been no doughnuts. I play to win. Yes, I do know how truly pathetic this is.  Well, I was almost right. My son's gift and card arrived late this afternoon which is earlier than I thought was possible. Now, I have a total of 16 charm links and that leaves only four more to finish it off. I loved the card. On the front is a black and white pic of an Alice in Wonderlandish Queen. It says: "As a matter of fact, I  am  the fucking QUEEN." Inside he wrote: "Happy Late Mother's Day. Hope you like your charms." Love..... How can I be mad even if it is late?&nbsp;To view&nbsp;the card&nbsp;check out  urlLink this !&nbsp; If you are as eccentric as moi, you might enjoy&nbsp;the site. I must go now and start adding my charm links and rearranging my bracelet.&nbsp; >^..^  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      MY SON AND I share an affection for the round-headed little boy, Eric Cartman, on  South Park  so much so that I now have a new Cartman charm. I think Cartman is the amped up version of Charlie Brown of  Peanuts  fame. They both have round heads and do dumb things although I think Cartman is more savvy and edgy and would take pleasure in tormenting Charlie Brown. I had a hairstylist who went to great lengths describing why my facial geometry called for a certain type of haircut. She lifted her right hand in the air and drew a perfectly round circle and then said: "You see, Catnip, you have a round face and so we need to do this, blah, blah, blah." After that diss, I switched to a gay brother and you what? He never draws air pictures or any of that. He talks about his life, cuts my hair, and is a genius at making my round head look muy bueno. I say that all the Charlie Brown Cartmans of the world need to unite and give all the other non-round heads the finger. Maybe, we should also draw an air picture to go with it.   Copyright© 2004.

      I wanted to see if I could successfully link to another site. After an hour, this is as good as it's gonna get, my friends,&nbsp;until or if&nbsp;I ever&nbsp;figure it out. &nbsp;It really&nbsp;makes me proud to be&nbsp;a Democrat. Dubya has reached a&nbsp;new low.&nbsp; I'm no&nbsp;DNA expert,&nbsp; but honestly where are they wharehousing the poop or do they just blow it up? I'm sooooo&nbsp;confused.&nbsp; See what you think.&nbsp;    Bush's Visit To Turkey   News Analysis by Ugur Akinci, Ph.D.   When President Clinton visited Turkey in December 1999, he won a lot of hearts by visiting the earthquake victims and mingling with the crowds. At one point I believe he even grabbed a baby from the crowd and kissed him to the amazement and delight of many Turks.  President Bush's current trip to Turkey is taking place in a radically different environment of super-tight security and paranoia.  This is the first time ever I've heard that the U.S. Secret Service is taking a special&nbsp;toilet unit to Turkey just for Mr. Bush's private use so that the terrorists won't have access to the presidential fecal matter and thus his DNA. Washington was concerned that such DNA could be used to produce chemical or biological weapons targeting specifically the U.S. President. The security in Turkey is that tight.  Mr. Bush is not a very popular figure in Turkey right now. The majority of the Turks perceive him as a reckless politician who lied his way into Iraq to secure oil and business profits for the fat cats of the American establishment. That's the common perception.  However, no matter what his popularity is, the visit of an American president is still an important event, especially when the troublesome developments in Iraq suggest certain possible consequences that would effect Turkey directly. Hence this visit will certainly witness some tough negotiations between Ankara and Washington.   I never could get this new blogger permalink function to work so if you click below it will take you to the site if you want to read the whole thing. Read  urlLink this !&nbsp;Go to the article on Bush's Visit To Turkey on 6-26-2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, I can't get this to work.

      LET ME BE THE FIRST to say: Embrasse mon tcheue! Ya don't need to know what it means. Just know that it expresses my extreme unhappiness. It has been years since I've been called on for jury duty and I will state that the Catnipper has never even had to go in for an interview after I fill out the questionaire. They didn't send me one  this time for some reason. As of Tuesday a.m., PT will be driving Miss Catnip into town and I will ascend the County Courthouse steps and visit the sorry bitch who sent me this summons. Jury duty is not for me. I think everyone I know is guilty of something and if they got caught and are sitting in a courtroom by a lawyer then they are GUILTY!!! It better not be one of those methlab or child molestation trials because I can guarangoddamntee it that they will be found guilty by me.   I have a burr under my saddle, a pain in my ass, a glitch in my software, an unscratchable itch, a desire to maim, a need to piss and moan all day and night if necessary. Here is what I do in these types of situations. I write a cleverly worded letter. First of all, Catnip does not drive. She has no opposable thumbs and even if she did, PT would not allow it. I have not driven since the summer of 1999. I drive like Mr. Magoo to begin with and now I am full of medications that make me drowsy. Basically, I wrote a letter asking Mr. Grand High Poobah to puleaaaze escusem wah me from his jury selection process due to the fact that PT would be extremely inconvienced trying to work and drive Miss Catnip all over tarnation. I very diplomatically asked if the court would be willing to accomodate my need to take medication at 8 a.m., 1 p.m, 3 p.m., and 5 p.m. If they want a woman sitting in the jury box swigging down medication four times a day, so be it. I'm not too alert in the mornings. Tomorrow we ride into town to do battle with the judicial system. If they force me to go anyway and I am chosen for jury doodie, then the defendant is going down even if all he did was to hit a puppy on the ass with a newspaper. Catnip had plans to get caught up on some other things, but NO they need me on their jury for a puppy swatter. I am going to make some Catmint tea and massage my cat's tummy fat. It soothes my nerves and he kinda likes it. You may go now. I'll still be here waiting to see if the court agrees to kick my crazy ass off their hostage list of jurors. Hiss. Hiss. Meyeow!

      Catnip has some kind of exotic cold/flu/malaria, but she cannot ignore her public so she is soldiering on. She's not sure who they might be or if there really are any people reading her blog. Someday, she hopes to get some peeps of her own.   This week I have read some things and seen some things that you might not be aware of. I tuned in on  The Graham Norton Effect  via  The Comedy Channel  the other night and I must say that he is my pick for the hottest new show. Here's what I learned. Gone are the days of those tacky beach ball kind of blow up dolls. Ladies, the scientists have created a new lifesize Miss Hottie doll that is anatomically correct and has an ass you can bounce a quarter off of. Some guy on the show was spanking it and that's why I know that. Very realistic looking hair and, of course, she's wearing  Victoria's Secret  bras and panties with thigh high black stockings. Men, you must provide the sexy, strappy shoes to finish off the total package. Yep, she's got everything including a designer hoo hah. If a crate shows up at your house that might be big enough to accommodate a very thin pliable woman, it's her. Just thought you ladies might want to know.   Here's something on  The History Channel  that you might accidentally watch thinking it will be like  Sex and The City . It's called  Sex and The Civil War  and it's just not the same. Very disappointing.  Recently, I read a book about a female psychic who is not Sylvia Browne or anyone of her caliber. I flipped through this book hoping I would find some new secret ways to tweak my own psychic nature. Sylvia always has exercises, lots of input, really explains things in detail, and sometimes she provides a CD. What I learned from this particular book is that the author took the details from the books written by about four different prominent psychics and stuck all their secrets in her book. After spending about an hour speed reading through it, I gave it to PT to drop off at the library when he goes to get another book for himself. Nope, can't tell you the name of it. Don't need to be sued.  PT reads an awful lot of serial killer/murder mystery novels. I rarely go in with him so the library gals probably think he's already offed me and I'm laying out in the woods with a cap in my ass. They probably also think I had it coming. I thought I would give one of the books he read a try. After that I read four more written by this particular author. Here is what I've learned about the main character who is a coroner. She has a huge rack. She keeps walking in on her niece and finding her kissing another woman. I think she should knock before barging in and leave the girls alone. Almost every book involves fraternal twin killers. I'm waiting for the triplet killers next. Without fail, there is the kindly older woman who helps her out with a super place to stay when she is being harassed and pursued by the psychopathic serial killer. Now, I know I said she had a huge rack and all that, but why does each serial killer specifically want to ravage her, check out her rack, and then kill her? Frankly, I'm worried about the kind of men she attracts. When will she learn that she might need to find another profession? You know the author could mix it up and maybe have the psychopathic serial killer fall in love with some other character every now and then. The police, FBI, SWAT team, and other law enforcement people spend all their time protecting her sweet ass. I say that  she is the whole problem . My advice  for her would be to get breast reduction surgery and try not to be so damned sexy. I couldn't live with the idea that every new case that came in was going to bring another fatal attraction kind of love my way. You know, maybe she could have one of those designer dolls for men made to look just like her and then she could get some actual work done and avoid having a traumatic near death experience in each book.   I have a fever, am hurting all over, can't quit coughing up bad things long enough to sleep and probably have diptheria, so if none of this makes sense that's the reason why. I think I already said something similar to this already. Oh well...........  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

An Ultra Sound Dog Chaser that emits a high pitched sound heard only by dogs and men over the age of 60.   A pair of night vision goggles so I can spy on the neighbors when there's nothing good on TV.  I wanted to buy him some special undershirts with a bullseye printed on the front and the back and he said, "NO!"  A leaf blower to use after his dawgs come into my spotless house and bring in half the yard with them. After he lets them out, I could blow everything right back where it came from. It could also be used as a blow dryer for the really big dawg when he gets his bubble bath.  Any diet book that says he can't have any more of things that end in the letters drates and ugar.  No Tofutti, seaweed wraps, oolong tea, herbal tea, prissy tea biscuits, mini quiche bites, vegetables that can't be fried, anemic nonfat milk, decaf anything, and no sissy lattes.  Copyright© 2004.

      Catnip has a lot of opinions and she doesn't mind sharing them with the world at large. These are subjective observations on her part, but she believes every word of it and you should too.  If someone gives you fruitcake for Christmas, it means they hate you. In fact, they hate you so much that they hope you choke on the dried fruit embedded in the even drier cake. There is a brand that costs 35 bucks that ain't bad, but they'd never buy one of those for you because they hate you.    The skidmarks or skiddoo in your man's drawers actually means something. As you glare at them in total disgust, you must analyze them like a Rorschach test and see what they reveal. Please be advised that you might not like the secrets you uncover. They are better when viewed from a distance. Do not view them up close and personal unless you are wearing a surgical mask and latex gloves.   All long-haired cats secretly hate their hair and long to have buzz cuts. After shearing, they have easy access to all their body parts and can lick things they haven't seen in years.  If someone gives you diet products or diet books for your birthday or Christmas, they aren't your friend. In fact, you should regift them with said objects of torture thereby implying that you, their former friend, think they are a total fat ass.   If your very conservative, anal spouse mentions that someone is a dork, it means that person is an uber dork, the king of all dorks, a dork for all eternity, a dork to tenth power, and most likely they sleep in feetie pajamas. Red flannel fuzzy ones.  The rural myth regarding egg sucking dogs is true. Catnip knows this because she raises ducks and geese who lay a lot of eggs. Her two big dawgs go on Easter egg hunts every morning and then bring the eggs one by one back onto the one grassy area by the porch. Before the day is over, the eggs are broken into and the contents are sucked out leaving nothing behind.  Catnip knows a person who claims to be a world-renowned psychic astrologer simply because she took a trip to Africa one time and read a couple of charts while she was there on vacation. She backs up this claim by displaying a picture of her dressed in native garb standing next to a giraffe.    Catnip had a friend whose husband wears women's underwear. Now, when she sees this man, she secretly wonders if he wears granny panties, french cut panties, crotchless panties, cotton or nylon panties, and does he use a pantie liner? You know, to take care of those skidmarks he'll be leaving. Go back to Catnip's second entry for comprehensive explanation.      Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      Catnip knows that she is cheating on this one because Yoko Ono is still amongst the living. She would like for the reader to pretend that it is actually the year 2035 and Yoko has indeed passed over to the Other Side. She still hasn't given up on her singing career and has assembled her band.   Lead Vocals:  Yoko Ono Backup Singer: Tiny Tim  Drums: Keith Moon  Kazoo and Cowbell: Janis Joplin  Keyboards: Liberace Bass: Jimi Hendrix   She's all set up in a surreal rock and roll theater of the absurd. Let's see how things are going so far.   A background track is grinding out a dirge of strange acoustical strains that sound like a train rumbling over railroad tracks while a pod of whales spout ultrasonic bleats out of their blow holes. Yoko is warming up her voice by gargling with Satan's piss and yodeling at the same time. Finally, she signals that she is ready and " The Blangers " whip into one of their best songs simply titled " Bald Pussy ." Her cacophonous, high pitched, warbling causes ear drums to rupture, dogs to howl, satellite signals to bounce off Uranus, nuclear reactors to melt, old men to hear again, dolphins to beach themselves, Michael Jackson's nose to fall off, and all pop singers to become virgins again. Tiny Tim is blanging away on his catgut scraper ukelele singing softly in his patented enharmonic falsetto style. His hair changes colors in perfect time to Keith Moon's rat-a-tat-tat drumming. First it turns red, then green, then orange, and lastly purple. Liberace is on keyboards trying to quietly blend in with his keyboard noodlings, candelabra, and nonstop smiling. Janis bangs slowly on the cowbell while mewling on the kazoo. Jimi Hendrix works his guitar in a combination of impressive screechs and yowls. Together, they execute explosive contortions and throw polyrhythmic vocal grenades into the heavenworld audience.   Suddenly, lightening strikes all over heaven and earth. Gabriel has been summoned by God and he is briefed. He delivers a message to The Blangers. " Behold. Thy music offends the ear of God and if you do not stop this racket immediately, he is coming. " Yoko and her Ono Orpheus Om Blangers vanish into thin air and peace is finally restored. God is pleased with what his hand has wrought and he can rest in peace once again.   Copyright© 2004.

       ONE OF MY SON'S who does not wish to have his identity revealed called this a.m. and said that President Bush had come to his town to campaign. There were 600 protestors gathered in the street close to his workplace. Bush went into a building where 10,000 of his supporters were waiting to greet him properly. We are all Democrats and after the latest beheading in Iraq, we are concerned about the draft being reinstated if Bush is re-elected. My two sons will definately be eligible. I think Zoey can escape that fate if she is actively involved in the Peace Corp like she is planning. My oldest son can't pass the physical, so he will be safe. I won't bore you with all my political views. I support all the American troops in Iraq, but I do not support the reason for which they were sent. The Iraqi people have been living the same lifestyle for thousands of years and we are not going to change that overnight or even in this century.  Yesterday was Father's Day and PT has received gifts and cards from everyone, but KC. He is late as usual, but he has it ready to go into the mail. I guess I should just understand that he is unable to get his act together no matter how much I remind him. He's had a hard life so I try not to make it any more difficult than it already is.  PT had to go into work early today and open the store by 5:30 a.m. It's a dipshit idea and I hope it flops in their corporate faces. They come up with the dumbest ideas.  My mother asked me to watch a special on Alzheimers which I did. What I saw scared me and I had no idea that there were people not that much older than I am who have it. My mother knows that I think she has it and that I've been wanting her to go in for testing. She says,  What's the point? If I have it, there's nothing they can do. " Well, actually they can, if they catch it early enough. She didn't make a lot of sense today when I called her. Some days she's with it and sometimes she's not.  Guess who else is out flying around in the ozone layer? Catnip! I sat here talking about KC being late and it just hit me that I have not bought  my  father a card. Crap, maybe I need to get tested for brain damage myself.&nbsp; >^..^  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws. Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      Look out kitty cause Momma's gonna have to stick this bass drum right where you're sitting. My trigger thumb has made it impossible for me to continue playing the drums which take up an awful lot of space in the room I have them all shoved into. I have not been content as of late and I blame Sheryl Crow for this. She has a CD on which she sings a song called " A Change Would Do You Good." What in the hell does she know about my life? Apparently, everything. In this song, she features a whole kazoo section and she made me want one really bad! Catnip will do anything to make some kind of noise and call it music. At age nine some wanna be maestro told my mother that I was not accordion player material and I was dismissed from his Lawrence Welk ass loving class. Hmmph! Scarred for life! I can still remember the shame like it was just forty-five years ago. At least that incident kept me from being an accordion playing dorkette. I know things and I know that when my generation starts getting sent to the nursing home, they're gonna need a drummer and/or kazoo player and I will be ready for them.   PT tried to make me feel better by purchasing me a 99 cent kazoo from the dollar store, but I wanted a professional kazoo with an instruction booklet. He claimed that he didn't know where he could find the professional ones. I took care of that little problem for him with a single trip to the Amazon and my new kazoo has finally arrived!    Scoff if you must, but the art of kazoo playing is very complicated. First you must choose the pitch you desire from the following selections:   The Tony Soprano Kazoo- the highest pitch of all the kazoos. It makes flute farts. The Alto Kazoo- mimics clarinet and trumpet sounds in a very sarcastic manner. The Tenor kazoo-tricks you into thinking it's a saxophone once owned by Bill Clinton. The Baritone Kazoo-reminiscent of the French horn or Freedom horn for Republicans. The Kaboom Kazoo- Holy Cow, it sounds just like a tuba.  The kazoo has a dark side. Oh yes, dear reader, it do. Early Africans, as opposed to those who came in late to work, used hollowed out bones which they covered with animal membranes to make their noisemakers. They used their homemade kazoos to make spooky sounds and impersonate the voices of the dead bringing back messages from the spirit world. The local shaman would don his ceremonial mask and robes and abuse his kazoo in an effort to intimidate and scare his audience. He called his "kazoo" the Mirliton. Men just love naming their stuff don't they?   A few hundred centuries later the world listened in hushed anticipation of the unveiling of the first live kazoo recording. A group called "The Mound City Blue Blowers" got together in St.Louis in 1923 to perform this feat. I know it sounds like the name of a porn vid. Anyway, after the initial excitement died down the kazoo eventually lost it's impact and with that it's audience.   That is until a certain, certain Mr. Eric " Cocaine " Clapton used said kazoo in a live version of "San Francisco Bay Blues" taken from his 1991  Unplugged  album. Critics found his kazoo solo to be colorless and lacking any special attributes. How much you wanna bet that critic was the same prick who bounced me out of accordion school? To be an artiste is to suffer.   I wonder where Sheryl Crow found her herd of kazooer's? Maybe, I should just go to Google and type in professional kazoo players. Hopefully, they will make a comeback this century. The instructions are very plain and simple: How to Play The Kazoo by Cooder Dweeble. The kazoo produces it's special sound from the vibrations of the membrane due to the act of humming. This shit is sounding awfully familiar. Oh, well, let's read on shall we? Any attempt to blow on the kazoo will result in failure. Oh, now, I know where I've heard this before- The Joy of Sex  book of the 70's! Reading on....Just hum into it dummy! If you have to blow it, then you are not playing a kazoo.   I'm going to go drag out my old vinyl Taj Mahal album called "Natch'l Blues" while I try out my new professional kazoo. If it doesn't hum right away, I'm throwing it on the floor for the cats to attack. Patooey!    Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      IN THE MESOZOIC ERA, men's cars were considered phallic symbols. If he had a good ride, he could get a worthy passenger. I wonder what today's vehicles say about their driver's sexual prowess?   Dodge Ram Pickup-This man will behave in the traditional Ram, wham, thank you mam mode and then he will Dodge the issue of his premature ejaculation problem.  Ford Explorer-He will touch and lick things on your body that you do not want Explored and then he will want to kiss you right on the lips and stick his tongue down your throat afterwards.   Ford Focus-Oh Boy.This man Focuses on one thing, namely your clitoris. He will rub it with his thumb until it bleeds, if you don't fake an orgasm immediately.  Jeep Grand Cherokee-Okay, this is kind complicated. He plans the ambush, thinks his penis (Jeep) can go anywhere it wants without any problem whatsoever and it will be just Grand. Ouch!  Honda Civic-Unless you are short of stature and have a very small boney ass, pass on this guy. He only has the ability to accommodate small spaces.  Chevrolet TrailBlazer-Unless you are into kink, don't even get in the front seat. He likes to Blaze new Trails and that means you missy.   Chevrolet Cavalier-He is so rude! He will screw you and then ask you to leave before you have the postcoital cigarette. He has such a Cavalier attitude.  Ford Escape-He is so charming and a real hunk. After sex, he will get up to go into the bathroom and Escape out the window. You will be left to sleep in the wet spot and will spend the rest of the evening crying your eyes out.   Ford Econoline-Name says it all. It's McDonald's, a rented porno film, and then he will attempt to reenact it with you. Run like the wind before he takes a shine to you.   Toyota Corolla/Matrix-He thinks he's Keanu from the Matrix and has weird rubber swings hanging from his ceiling. He enjoys burning hairs off of his arms with his Corolla cigar. He will treat you like his personal chew Toy.   Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      To be fair, I think the reality shows should mix it up and start using the  really  real people of the world. Here are some of the shows I think would be interesting.  1. Take homeless people off the street, do intense makeovers with no surgery involved, and then drop them off in a corporate type setting. As each one is discovered to be a fraud, they are eliminated and sent back to the streets. The one who is not detected as a fake receives an actual job offer. Tune in to see if they take it the job or go back to their old way of life. It's a total shockeroo!  2. After selecting one pimp and his hoe's out working the streets, they are placed in a pricey condo where all the hoe's get makeovers. Afterwards, the condo is furnished with a receptionist who makes sure no one can see them unless they call for an appointment first. The pimp daddy would have a complete GQ wardrobe makeover and a nice shiney mahogeny desk to sit behind. His job is to learn how to run an upscale call-girl service. One hoe would be eliminated each week according to how well she performed on the job. The last ho standing would be given a job with a real call-girl agency. The pimp would then be free to continue with his previous career and keep the GQ clothes.   3. Professional corporate heads assume the role of sanitation engineers and play a twisted game of scavenger hunt. The twist is that there is no grand prize, but they don't know this. Messages are left taped to the lid inside certain garbage cans which gives them instructions as to which garbage sack they need to find to grab the item they need. No one is eliminated until the very last show. The crew who finds most of the items wins and they are allowed to return to the corporate cesspool. There's really nothing in this game for the corporation heads, but it's a lot of fun to watch them dig in other people's trash even if it is only for a few weeks. Office underlings will love it!  4. Computer addicts are locked inside a house under strict security for 3 months. No computers, no cell phones, and no high tech anything. The television is an antique black and white and with no remote. If they want to watch something else, someone will have to get up and change the channel manually.They are to learn how to talk to real people and create a new life without computers. I heard they are having trouble getting contestants for this one.   5. One attorney for the defense is reunited with 15 newly released felons living in a halfway house. They are still angry with him because they had to do jail time. Tune in to see the creative ways in which they vent their anger on him. Wait to see the explosive ending and see if the attorney lived and/or if he will need extensive surgery.This is Catnip's favorite pick.  Copyright© 2004 Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens.

      I REALLY DIDN'T INTEND TO share any of this with anyone, but why not? I got to thinking about the 1970's when I lived 45 minutes away from San Francisco. I had been married for a couple of years and had no children of my own at that time. I did, however, have two very eccentric brother-in-laws.  I guess I should discuss my first father-in-law. He was a self-described open minded thinker way ahead of his time. He also was a High School Principal. My first husband and I moved from Texas to California to live with his parents for a brief period of time. Cocktail hour started at 5 p.m. sharp and earlier on weekends. I drank one single mulberry dacquri and spent the entire night puking it up thus ending any future hora de la cocktails for me. One night my new husband, mother-in-law, and father-in-law all decided that they would like to go to the titty bar and insisted that I go with them. Uh Uh. I was nineteen and I knew I didn't need to see anyone's tits for any reason. The final insult came when I walked through the kitchen one afternoon and there sat my father-in-law with a book he wanted me to read. It was called "Open Marriage" The premise of this tome was that married couples should experiment with other sexual partners with the full consent of their spouses. Oh, Catnip knew where this was going. I immediately started looking for an apartment of our own so we could get away from the weirdness. This was not to be because the weirdness was genetic.  One of my teenage brother-in-laws was an amateur photographer and had his own darkroom set up inside his bedroom. When girlfriend came over, they would disappear into the darkroom where they were always "developing film" and no one could come in. Strange, how some photos appeared of said girlfriend posing in the nude in front of the unique purple colored drapes in the in-laws bedroom. My other brother-in-law was still a little twerp. Time passed by and they both graduated from High School and moved into their own digs. They worked at the local cannery and made good money. Unfortunately, it was spent on weed and other assorted drugs. One of them got so whacked out on weed that he would sit in one position all day just playing his flute. My ex threatened to break the flute in half and shove it up his A-hole if he didn't stop it. Hang on, this does get funnier later on. In fact, today, it's totally hysterical.  After this hedonistic period, the brothers-in-law decided it was time to head to Frisco full-time. The young one followed the older one no matter where he went. They ended up the annual Hare Krishna Haight Street Festival in San Francisco. Haight Street was the epicenter of the hippy movement. It must've impressed them a great deal because they joined immediately. First the Krishna devotee is stripped of all material possessions which in their case included a car, expensive camera equipment, and everything else they owned. They were issued the distinctive orange robes and were ripe for this cult to take over their lives. Devotees were expected to be up at 5 a.m., take a cold shower, chant for hours, become vegetarians, read the Bhagavad Gita, practice celibacy, keep the temple clean and become street beggars to bring in loot for the upper level Krishna followers. These are the annoying folks at the airports with the tambourines and flowers who want a "donation." The youngest finally couldn't take it any more and appeared at our door one afternoon. They were not allowed to keep in touch with family members, so I hadn't seen him in months. He came in and got out of his robes which really didn't help his look. Devotees have to shave off all their hair except for one single lock about 7 inches long. My husband dubbed them the Twig People and I secretly thought about going in with my scissors and doing a little snip snip. I cooked what I thought were vegetarian meals and Twig Boy taught me how to make a caramelized desert out of sweet canned milk by boiling it in a pan of water. He left our house because I wasn't cooking proper meals for him according to my mother-in-law. I gladly turned him over to her for custody. He didn't last long there either.  The eldest Twig Person came looking for his brother, but he did stay long enough to tell us what slaves we were to the establishment and the corporate world. Hari Krishna, Ramalamla Ding Dong. I thought I was a Medical Assistant, but I guess I was a corporate slave. He asked us if we had anything he could eat, could he borrow twenty bucks, and would we drive him to the bus station? Yes, we could and would! We worked so we could buy food to eat and all that other silly stuff people waste their money on like a car and a roof over their heads. I was a damned good sister-in-law because I definitely did not dig their scene at all and had the power to send them packing for good. Their brother-my husband wanted them out of our long hair. The Eldest Twig went back to the temple and made it into upper management with the Krishnas. He went by to visit his mother and told her all about his cash flow and showed her his new Krishna van. Wonder how they could afford it?   Hare Krishna Hare Krishna  Krishna Krishna Hare Hare  Hare Rama Hare Rama  Rama Rama Hare Hare   The youngest resurfaced one day homeless and all disheveled, but he did have hair this time. I was pregnant at the time and he was of some help to me so he moved in until he could get himself together. He even got engaged and this is my favorite memory of him. He bought his woman a diamond engagement nose stud and he was mighty proud of it, I might add.  At Christmas, they gave me a beginners astrology book which began my career as a serious student of the craft. I did charts for 30 years and then gave it up, except for those special folks I run into from time to time. I am not talking about those stupid sun sign reports that you see in the newspapers and magazines. I do professional readings with a person's own exact date and time of birth along with their place of birth. I liked the challenge and belonged to an astrologer's group that did readings on celebrities and other famous folks. We'd each post our analysis on a website and see what everyone else thought. I decided to lay it down recently, because it was time consuming, plus I didn't charge anyone. I guess I was ready to move on like I do from time to time.  My youngest brother-in-law died in the 80's and the other brother is living somewhere very exotic with his wife and kids. Now, that I'm oh so much older, I don't think about any of the bad times anymore. I just think about my Bohemian in-laws and smile. I am grateful for the time we had together no matter how it all eventually turned out. It's always those damned little things that bring a tear to your eye and make you homesick for the person you used to be.   Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      For centuries, the Tooth Fairy has reigned supreme while all the other fairies have fallen on hard times. Now, they are mostly addicted to pixie dust and need money to support their habit. There are several scams being perpetrated by these rogue fairies. Their victims are approached and told to leave certain body parts under their pillows, they will come and take these items to the proper place to exchange them for cash which they will then split with the donor. A receipt is left under the pillow along with a notice not to expect payment for at least 4-6 weeks, but the fairies never return with the money. Do not become their next victim.   Here is a list of the most well-known fairy offenders.      Eyebrow Fairy-This one suggests that you place duct tape on your eyebrows and then just yank them off all at once. Leave the tape on your nightstand instead of under the pillow. People with alopecia need these to replace their own eyebrows.  Foreskin Fairy-The most disturbing fairy of all. He makes claims that the foreskin can be used in reconstructive upper eyelid surgery by plastic surgeons. They are in enormous demand and no price is too much. You just won't see any of it.  Mole Fairy-Moles on the face are referred to as beauty marks. There's an increased interest in having strategically placed facial moles a la Cindy Crawford at this time due to the new reality shows featuring plastic surgery makeovers.     Nail Clippings Fairy-Fairly harmless because all they ask for are finger and toenail clippings which are sold to nail repair salons all over the world.    Tonsil Fairy-A very charismatic type of fairy who claims there are children doing without tonsils in Third World countries and they need them desperately.    Umbilical Cord Fairy-This is the sneakiest one of all. They don't even ask their victims. They simply break in after a certain number of days have passed and help themselves to it. Word on the street is that the cord has some kind of fountain of youth effect on the old saggy skin of celebrities.   Vampire Fang Fairy-This fairy is very elusive. Finding a donor is extremely tedious work and there are only a few such Fang Fairies left. To investigate this requires putting our officers at great risk. If you are a Vampire, then consider yourself warned.   Copyright© 2004 Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.    Fairies Gone Bad

      I'VE BECOME A REAL homebody since my 1999 nuclear meltdown. I took a job after moving to our current State of Despair and then the nice "church folks" at my workplace took me down. I'd joined one of the local churches thinking that might ward off their irrational behavior, but they have mean-spirited folks there too. The mistake I made was going Methodist instead of Baptist. My friend, Debra, once told me that the devil and all his demons just loved going to church. I laughed right in her face, but as it turns out, she was correct. My apologies to Debra wherever you may be. I'm not going to make a big deal out of this, but what happened in a short eight month timespan certainly made a lasting impression on me and I think it scarred me for however much time I have left on earth. My Grandmother Jewell lived to be 97 and that shit better not happen to me. I know it's going to, though, because I inherited all of her quirky genes. This is leading somewhere, I promise.  Seeing me in public these days is like the rare sighting of a bald eagle. A couple of folks had to wait five years before they ever saw me again. They wanted me to go to lunch with them and have fun like we used to when I worked with them. That's funny because what I remember are the dirty underhanded Survivor like tactics they used on me so that a preacher's wife could take my job. I made a surprise visit to the office one evening only to catch the saintly woman doing all the work so I wouldn't have anything to do when I came in the next day. It's sad when your worst fears are confirmed. I grabbed all my doodads, folders, favorite erasers, framed photos, and crafty art shit that belonged to me and staggered out to the car. I had already written my see ya later notice; complete with self-addressed stamped envelope so they could mail me my final check. I left that along with my key to the joint. I never did find out what they valued in an employee, but I was sick of eating all the shit they could shovel my way. I was exhausted, disgusted, and done in. PT took my blood pressure that night and it was 184/115, so I went to bed and stayed there waiting to have a stroke off and on for about a year. Eventually, I'd get up and go sit on the back porch for awhile and wait out there to die. My doctor didn't make things any easier by threatening me with the news that I was a walking time bomb and it was only a matter of time until I had a heart attack or stroke. I have steadfastly refused to take any medication that makes me feel worse than death on pumpernickle. It's been five years and I have yet to have one chest pain or any other health problems. As soon as I see that black pythonic pressure cuff or anyone dressed in medical garb coming my way, my blood pressure spikes. That makes them want to give me even MORE medication. Right now, I am going off of my hormone replacement therapy. I don't want to take any more medications or have to make those neverending series of doctor visits. I never set foot in that church again. I hadn't been a church person since I was 18 anyway. I think I'll stick with the heathens because at least you know where you stand with them.  I no longer drive because it gives me flaming fantods. I'm not even a particularly good passenger as I like to drive from the back seat. I wish PT would let me lay down back there when we get into heavy traffic though. He is my appointed chauffeur and with his erratic work schedule, I do not feel like burdening him any further with my afflictions by making him drive me places on his day off. We did go out this past week and as we sailed by the grocery store, I saw a big sign saying HUMANE SOCIETY. There was a huge B-B-Q pit shaped like a barrel with some picnic tables and chairs sitting right next to it. I couldn't see any pets up for adoption and then I started to panic.   Catnip:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  PT, do you think they're gonna throw a puppy or kitten into the flames every hour until someone adopts a pet ?  PT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course not, that's just a B-B-Q barrel for smoked turkey legs !  Catnip:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  So, they will kill the turkeys ?  PT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sighing.  Yes, I guess they will kill a turkey .  Catnip:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bastards !  I don't trust them, take me home .  PT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That's where I'm headed .   Just so you know, we have adopted four cats and one giant 125 pound Great Pyrenees from the Humane Society. I have forbidden PT to even look at their ads in the local newspaper because if either one of us has a weak moment there will be yet another pet living among us. We also have two cats that we paid cashola for. The bulimic 7 pound runt Persian of the group cost the most and she hates all the cats, dogs, and pretty much everybody, except for me. Even with all of these animals, we still took in a stray dog a few years ago. We didn't mean for this to happen, but what are you gonna do? I no longer have a beautiful ultra clean home and, now, I only vacuum when I see that my shoes are getting fuzzy. If I do vacuum or wash all the throw rugs, the cats take turns puking on everything. If I mop, then the dogs will see to that they go roll in something rancid that very day before coming into the house to eat. I know what you're thinking. I could feed them on the porch, but I have had the pleasure of seeing every creature on earth getting a snack from their metal dog food dispenser. Here is a list.   Snails without shells  Birds. Luckily, the buzzards stay out by the pond and eat dead fish.  Ditto, the resident Heron who likes to play with his food before he pokes it to death.  Squirrel Nutkin and his baby's mammas  Roadrunners  Neighborhood pets whose owners neglect to feed them.  Starving crackheads who own the pets who aren't getting fed.  Rocky Raccoon  A snow white dove  All the feral cats living in our canyon  Possums  Jackrabbits  Our geese and ducks  Pepe Le P.U.  Cougars  Komodo Dragons   Okay, I made up the last two, but all the rest is true. There's a cougar running around loose out here, but he only comes out at night to drink from our pond. We've only seen him once, but everyone else claims to have seen him too. Seeing him the one time did it for me and I don't leave the porch after the sun goes down. Well, that and because I can hear the coyotes howling while they hunt for food. I'd be their buffet if they ever figured out how to climb the front porch stairs or rip through the screening on our back porch.  Lest you think that I feel sorry for myself, I do not. Were it not for the unfortunate working incident that crashed all my former dreams, I would not be sitting here today in peace quietly blogging away and enjoying my life doing the things I want to do when I want to do them. I would, instead, still be working with THEM and having flaming fantods on a daily basis.   Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      I always seem to run into the overly religious. I would lay down an substantial amount of money and bet that these very people would shun Jesus if he were to show up in town. I can see it all now.   Two of our town's most pious are eating at the local KFC.   Myrtle:   "Oh my, don't look Ethel, there's some bum out on the sidewalk."  Ethel:    "Well, he must be some kind of sicko. Look at how he's dressed in that long white robe with those old dusty sandles on his feet.   Myrtle:   "Long-haired hippie is what he is, even if he is preaching."   Ethel:     "Let's call a meeting at City Hall and see if we can keep this guy off the streets. Maybe, we couldn't keep Walmart from building here, but I know we can rid the streets of people like that."   Myrtle:    "Wait until Pastor Jimbob 'Tater' Jenkins hears about this!"  Catnip:    "I think that's Jesus out there. I'm gonna go out and warn him right after I tell him what folks have done with stuff he supposedly said after BC."  PT:         "I don't think that's a good idea.   In a Tex-Mex restaurant, two local pastors are discussing their experiences regarding pressing the Holy Spirit into obeyance. The elder yokel gives the younger one some pointers on his ritual techniques. It involves some secret intricate hand signals and incantations. After that, the young minister was on his way to better management of The Holy Ghost. He would now come when called and perform as he was instructed. Hmmph!  At yet another restaurant, people are observed praying very loudly over their steaming plate of ribs, hush puppies, slaw, and french fries.   Catnip:   "Thank God, that's over with. Why do they always have to sit right by us?"  Flora:     "I just knew that God would deliver me from all that trouble that I was a havin with my lungs and heart. I'm good as new. Healed by the blood of the lamb."   Catnip:   "Aw crap, let's move over there by the obviously Catholic."   Catnip visits a friend and has the following conversation.   Friend:  Hey, who do you think is hot?  Catnip: Oh, you know the usual pretty boy types;Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt. Friend:  Brad Pitt! I like Anthony Hopkins. I used to work at the Dairy Queen and we had a customer who looked just like him. I always made sure I got to him before anyone else could take his order.  Catnip:  Really? Friend:  Yes, and I just voted for Dubya because he is so hot! Catnip:  What?   Friend:  Well, when I vote, I always just vote for the good looking one.  Catnip:  I'm a Democrat, so I vote for our candidate. If I don't like the candidate's platform, then I don't vote at all. Friend:  I remember back when Nixon was running. He was hot too. Catnip:  Feeling faint, short of breath, visions of Nixon's face running through her mind, nausea starting......You were sexually attracted to Richard Nixon?   Friend:  Yes, that's what I said. He was hot. Catnip:  I see.......  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws. Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.    Hear No Evil

      My son, KC, does not want to listen to my attempts to write humour. I've asked him why and he said it was because he was used to me being funny all the time. Perhaps I overdid it a couple of times, but I can still make him laugh regardless of his denial.    KC lives in another state and often entertains friends from all over the U.S. Let's just say that he lives in a very popular vacation spot. Two of his high school chums decided to fly out and suck in the atmosphere that can only be found in such a place.  KC went to pick up Jim Bob and Buffy at the airport only to discover that their luggage had arrived without them. They had been delayed due to their standby status.   Hours later, the cell phone rings and it's them. They are excitedly waiting for KC to pick them up and reunite them with their luggage. After greetings were exchanged, Buffy laid out her itinerary. Jim Bob just shuffled his feet and stared at the ground.    Buffy:   "I wanna go downtown and gamble, drink, see hookers on the street, go in a gay bar just to say I did, and I wanna see a Drag Queen!"   KC:      "Well, that shouldn't be too hard to find. You can go with me and see most of those items on my drive in to work. I'll give you directions to find the rest."   Days passed and way too much fun was had. Buffy and Jim Bob did it all. Sort of. I haven't gone on a long distance visit for quite some time. Apparently, there are new rules. According to the old rules of conduct, if you wanted to have sex on vacation you just did it. Things have changed, now you must ask permission.   Buffy:   "KC would you mind if we have sex?"   KC:      "You and me! What would Jim Bob think?"   Buffy:   "No! Can Jim Bob and I have sex in your house? We wouldn't want to upset you or your roomate."  KC:     "It's fine, just don't do it on the air mattress because it's not that sturdy."  The next morning, KC was up drinking coffee, when Buffy appeared and asked if he needed any help cooking breakfast. He poured her a cup of coffee and took her up on her offer.   KC:      "Let's make some huevo rancheros. You can cut up the peppers."  Buffy:  "I kind of have something to tell you. That air mattress is flatter than a fritter. We have no idea what could've happened. I think one of the cats must've gotten into the room and put a hole in it somehow."   KC:     "Buffy, I told you that you couldn't shag on that damned air mattress!"  Buffy:  "I'm really sorry, but we didn't. I promise."   KC:     "Well, I'll have my roomie drive Jim Bob to Walmart so he can explain what happened and get a replacement. I have to go in to work early today."  Roomie and Jim Bob load up the deflated air mattress and head off to the nearest Walmart. There was a long line at the Customer Service counter and it would be half an hour before they could dispose of the large flat object they were holding. All Walmart employees are called associates so I'm gonna just abbreviate it.  Walass:   "Hello, how may I help you?"  Jim Bob:   "Uh, I'd like to return this limp mattress and get a new one."  Walass:   "Whew, what happened? Looks like your kids used it for a trampoline."   Jim Bob:   "No mam, it just went flat during the middle of the night. I think it might have a slow leak or something. I don't have any kids. Can I just return it and get a new one?"   Walass:   "Why sure, we're Walmart and we live to please. Just fill out this form and describe what happened to this mattress. After that, please sign your name here, here, and here."   Jim Bob:  "Why do you need to know my address and phone number?"  Walass:   "It's just Walmart policy to keep track of who makes a return."  Jim Bob fills out the form with all his personal data and hesitates as he writes down the reason for the return. He knows the real reason. Unauthorized fucking on the air mattress. He slides the paper back to the Customer Servant.  Jim Bob:  "Now, can I have a new mattress?"  Walass:   "Sure, go get one and bring it back up here so I can scan it. "  Roomie and Jim Bob head to the back of the store which is about a two and a half mile hike into the Super Deluxe Gold Edition of Walmart.  Walass:   "Sharon, when will these folks figure out that you can't fuck on a air mattress?"  Sharon:    "You can't? Well, I guess I better return mine before I go on vacation."    Copyright© 2004.

      BACK WHEN DINOSAURS roamed the earth, people were busy trying to avoid being mistaken for dinosaur chow. Our ancestors didn't have time to worry about diets, carbs, saturated fats, or protein requirements. If they could catch something and skin it before it ate them, life was good.  I grew up during the era when vegetarianism was rampant and WE WERE what we ate. I decided to do an inventory of my probable genetic food-makeup. Here's the list.   Mango lips Fried pie thighs   Cheeto eyebrows Blueberry Muffin eyes Bacon impacted teeth Hog Burger Belly Button Biceps by aerosol cheese Sour Cream enchilada abdomen Ass cheeks courtesy of pudding and ice cream Cheese filled cheese pizza with extra cheese calves Boobies by chicken fried chicken breasts. Did I mention they're deep fried?    One of my sons lives in a world of beautiful people with perfectly shaped everything. He was standing in the middle of a posh mall, cell phone to ear, doing some people watching and giving me a visual evaluation of everyone who crossed his path. Apparently, there were women who dared to venture out in their shorts without checking themselves out in a full-length mirror first. Cellulite was rampant and did not belong in Perfectville. Today, I learned all about cankles which simply means there is no tapering between the calf and ankle thereby forming the hideous cankle. Cankles are bad, ugly, and if you have them, you must protect everyone from viewing them according to my son. I informed him that he should've watched  The Swan  as they now have a surgical cure for cankles. He seemed intrigued and let me go on and on about all the different procedures they use to create artificial beauty, so others won't be exposed to their less than perfect asses. He's forgotten that he was raised in a harsh world of undesirable physical attributes. We have a whole state full of fat dumplings and I wonder how he will be able to handle it when he comes to visit next month. Cankles will be the least of his worries. I happen to have very well defined ankles, but the rest of me is, well, less than perfect. I'm in the it doesn't matter category. Even if I were a perfect specimen, I would be disqualified because I'm old. It's actually rather nice because I no longer have to give a shit about what I look like.

      I KNOW I'M OLD and three-quarters crazy, but I sure don't understand certain things about today's pop culture. I love it, but I don't know what's going on. Thank Buddha that I have peeps I can call to give me the word on whazzup. Okay, I was watching something I shouldn't have been and now I need guidance from anyone under the age of 25.   Jessica Simpson introduced Eamon who started singing   I Don't Want You Back  which was all good. Eamon was mincing around the stage with his knees together which could mean several things. I determined that either he forgot to piss before going onstage or his package is so awesome that he has to walk that way to keep it from unfurling and flopping out on stage where he would undoubtedly step on it, fall down, and then things would get way too interesting. After I figured all this out, I noticed his backup singer was wandering all over the stage. I took notes and caught every word he sang to back up Eamon. I've decided to become somebody's backup singer since you don't need to harmonize your vocals with anyone else's which is good for The Catnipper.   These are Eamon's backup singer's lyrics. Yeah-Yeah-New York City-Yeah-What?-Yeah-Yeah-Whatcha say?-Drain-Pain-Uh-Uh-Uh-What?-???-Uh-Uh-Hey-Uh-Yeah-???Yeah.......Yeah-Oh-What she do?-Yo?-Time-At the party-Uh-Line-What?-Uh-Uh-Uh-Hey-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-What'dya say?-Uh-Yeah-Sign-Time-Ho-What?-Uh-Uh-Uh-Hey-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-Yeah-YEAH!  All I've got to say to that is Ho Ho-Ho Ho-Ho Ho-Ah Hah Yeah, Ho Ho-Ho Ho-Ah Hah Yeah, Ho Ho-Ho Ho-Ah Hah Yeah,  I don't want you back and how much do you pay for something like that? I needs to know. I plan to work on wardrobe and how to walk that way.   Copyright© 2004 Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.   The Backup Singer

      I blame this whole weird name business on Demi Moore's late mother. Demi was the name of a home permanent kit. Demi, of course, named her children, Rumer Glenn, Scout La Rue, and Tallulah Belle. It's just a damned good thing that these three girls have parents who are rich and famous or their asses would be thrashed every day before school, during school hours, and right after school. They could use the weekends to heal up. Now, Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin have a daughter named Apple. Hmmmmm. This has given me, Catnip, some ideas for other names that would be exotic and just as eccentric as those already mentioned and, yes, I know that Catnip should be on the list as well. To you, I say: FFFFSSSSTT!   Here are some names that I liked a lot and maybe you could use them to name your kid.

      WE HAD A PROBLEM a few months ago that required the assistance of an attorney and we handed over $2,000 for a retainer fee. The lawyer did absolutely nothing for this money and never did anything he said he was planning to do. Everytime, we'd meet with him, he had some plan that would clear things up right away and it would all be taken care of. His habit was to write letters threatening legal action if the people in question did not follow through with their part of our mutual contract. He would give them 14 days to comply. I would then call to see where things stood and he'd say,  Let's give them more time . After two months of this horseshit, I decided to smoke him out for the *pettifogger that he was and still is.  PT typed a very precisely worded letter outlining each and every mistake he had made along the way and informed him that we were not happy with his lawyering skills. I called him to inquire as to what the problem was and he stated that the county clerk was supposed to remind him of the court date and she must've forgotten. PT decided to tell him in writing that it was not the job of the county clerk to watch for cases that he was involved in and call him about each one. That was his responsibility and she was not to blame for his failure to appear in court. PT detailed some other items and told him,  in a nice way , what a motherscrubber we thought he was. He even eluded to the fact that we knew he'd been seen having lunch with the opposing attorney. I'm sure that he was convinced that the other guy had it in the bag, so there was really no point for him to waste his valuable time hanging around a stuffy courtroom on our account. In short, he tanked our case and then continued to lie regarding remedial steps that we could take to recoup our losses. We  demanded that he submit a detailed list of his charges for our $2,000.00 retainer fee. Or as we see it, money for nothing.  PT finished the letter, mailed it, and we waited for a response. It took him about two days to get back to us and I actually had to laugh when I read the detailed accounting of his total bill. In addition to our original retainer fee, he tacked on some more charges so that it would look like we  owed him  an additional $500.00. Very ballsy, but yet not unexpected. He listed them all in order of the time of the service. There were some charges that were legit, but I think the following were over the top.  $12.00   Box of staples        $3.00    Paper Clips              $8.00    Envelopes $15.00   Copies of court documents    $27.00   Ink used for printing letters         $9.00    One bucket of White Out               $37.50   Two block trip taken away from precious office time to walk fat ass over to courthouse to make copies, plus two block hike back across the street to office.                      $1.79    One Big Gulp to rehydrate after trip to courthouse   $20.00   Postage for threatening letters $75.00   Oxygen used by us breathing the air in his office         $60.00   Lunch with opposing attorney  $85.00   Forty-five minutes spent reading detailed list of client's complaints.  I've always wondered why people hated lawyers because up until we ran into this gonzo, we'd had good ones. This motherscrubber did have sense enough not to push the envelope and try to collect on the additional charges. He was already given 2 grand for doing nothing and we will pay his incompetent ass when hell freezes over, thaws, and then freezes over again. Okay, Motherscrubber? Will that work for you? Good!  *Pettifogger: Lawyers who earn their living making a big deal out of nothing like overcharging clients for things they didn't do.  Copyright© 2004 Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens.

      Have you seen the commercial regarding some Spanish fly aphrodisiac in pill form for women? I don't recall the name of the drug, but a tired looking woman spits out a litany of her complaints and says she just isn't able to get her game up for sex anymore. She takes her pill and the next thing you know she is jumping up and down on the bed like a child while her husband lays there smiling. She announces that she is now feeling passionate and good to go and then she makes the statement that this is what she's really like. If she really is like that, then why did she have to take a pill to behave that way? What in the hell is going on? Have they invented some new kind of foreplay that I don't know about? If I were the director, that sexually awakened woman would be laying stark naked under the man writhing in pleasure and not doing jumping jacks on the mattress in some very unsexy pajama outfit. Previously, she was just too tired from her stressful, harried existence.   Welcome to the world of your ancestors. Do you honestly think that folks in the 1700's gave a wrinkley rat's ass whether they were sexy, hot, or horney? Noooo, they were too busy having babies every two years until they had enough farm hands and house keepers to help run the farm and keep everyone alive long enough to die young. There was no birth control, so how did they manage to live in a one room cabin and yet have 14 children? Surely, somebody must've seen something going on at one time or other.  Here are some things you would not hear your ancestors saying.  Man to woman: Was it good for you? Women were not expected enjoy. They just had to endure it. All they had to do was lay real still for 2 or 3 minutes tops.   Woman: I'm pregnant. Is this convenient or shall I get an abortion?   Woman to Doctor: I'd like to have a c-section or maybe an epidural. Our ancestors slammed back some backwoods home brew and chewed on a belt for pain control.  Woman: I wonder if I should breastfeed or use a bottle? No choice whatsoever.  Woman: I think I'll take a nice hot bubble bath and read a book. No running water.  Man to woman: I think your butt's getting big, Gertrude. You need to go on a diet.  Man to woman: Look, I brought you some flowers and chocolates from the mercantile.  Woman: I'm thinking of getting breast implants and a tummy tuck.   Woman: I plan to vote this year. Women were not allowed to vote.   Woman: Donning a corset, long sleeved dress, and bonnet for the long ride in the buckboard to go town to shop. No shopping for sexy shoes, lipstick, or other cosmetics because only ladies of the evening wore that.   Man to woman: Can't you ever fix anything different for a change? They ate what they had if they had anything at all. Grandmother used to spread a big tablecloth over what was left from lunch and leave it on the table until time for supper.   Woman to man: When are you going to install the ceiling fans and put screens on the windows? No electricity.   Woman to children: Let's all go shopping for school clothes. Our ancestors couldn't read or write and their children wore handmade clothes, rarely had shoes, and in the deep backwoods there were no schools.   Man to family: Let's all get ready to go on a vacation away from all this drudgery.   Family: Can't we sleep in just this once?   Children: I want chocolate milk!  Mother: Don't you boys forget to put on your sunblock before you head out to the fields.   Woman: It's time for everyone to go to the dentist to get their teeth cleaned.   Woman: My hair's getting grey, I better get some hair dye.   Anyone in the 1700's: I'm bored. There's nothing to do around here.  I think you get the idea. The next time you think some elderly person is really lame just think about how difficult their lives must've been. After that, think about their ancestors and so on. Life's rewards were few and they sacrificed a great deal just so we can sit on our asses and plink on keyboards all day long. We don't have to worry about keeping ourselves alive by our own wits and brawn. I know my baby boomer generation wouldn't have the heart to live such a harsh life because we are really pampered pussies. My own mother lived through some things I wouldn't have wanted to be part of. I know this isn't my usual kind of post for this site, but it's 11:52 p.m. and I have writer's block.   One last thing. My mother always says that if you aren't itchy to begin with, why go and roll in poison ivy so you will be. This is her opinion of the horney pill commercial.

       I HATE KNOWING things in advance. I've always able been to diagnose people and animals;I know when someone is ill just by looking at them. PT and I took Pooks to the vet. Pooks has to be put under anesthesia just to have his nails trimmed and we used to take him in once a year for that and to have his hair sheared off for the summer. Today we took a towel with us so that we could control his legs and back by wrapping him up in it like a mummy with only his head sticking out; otherwise he's like an alligator that rolls to get away from trappers. The vet was able to use a tongue depressor to examine his mouth and he validated what I'd said three days ago. Pooks has a melanoma on his bottom lip the size of a small marble. The vet tried to assure me that this wasn't a death sentence, but I know melanomas are deadly and they spread like wildfire depending on the stage they're in. He told us to take him home and let him know if it got any bigger. I wasn't willing to take that chance so I refused. Pooks is having surgery to remove the tumor and I asked them to clip his nails and shear off all his hair while he was under anesthesia. If he has any further melanomas, I can catch them much quicker with all his hair gone. He's such a beautiful cat and I've decided not to tell my daughter Zoey when she comes home in the next couple of weeks. His surgical wound will be healed and she will just think he has his regular summer cut. I can't deal with losing another cat in less than two weeks. PT is driving me crazy about Pooks. I went online to see what I could find out about feline melanomas and while they are not fatal for dogs, they are for cats. PT did not want to hear this and refused to talk to me, ignoring me while he stared at the television. Later on, he came back here to tell me that he was going to go get the cat carrier and put it in the car just in case Pooks gets to come home early. About an hour ago, the phone rang and it was him calling from work. He was busily trading dinner hours with a co-worker so he could go by and pick up the cat before the vet closed for the day. I am to make tuna sandwiches, so he can eat them on his way back to work. This is so peculiar. Pooks has not even been allowed to sit in his lap anymore because his nails are so long and sharp. I wonder if PT is a secret pet lover who just isn't demonstrative. I guess I better go and start fixing the tuna. More later.....Catnip I went into the kitchen to boil some eggs and found ants rappelling down from my window sill onto the counter, crawling all over the coffee maker, having a ball as they waved their antennae at me. To top it off, I thought we were out of tuna fish and I was prepared to substitute Friskies tuna if it came to that. Luckily, I finally found one single can beneath my stash of Top Ramen noodles. How would you ever know if those ever went bad on you? Just a stray thought of mine. The patient is back home with his new do. They shaved him everywhere except for his tail so he is rather comical looking. All this special care cost us $130.00. He's been wandering all over the house looking for something. Usually, he comes home all drugged up from the anesthesia, takes to our bed, and tries to hide under the covers. The rest of the cats form a circle around him and sit and stare like we're trying to sneak a new cat by them. Candypants will not leave Pooks alone either and is trailing behind; sniffing him the whole time. When I leave the house and come home, that dog has to do a whole body sniff on me which I don't care for at all. Let me just paint a picture for you. Candypants is very thorough and leaves no cavity unsearched. Umkay? I know PT like the back of my wrinkled hand. He left work 15 minutes early to go get the cat. I knew this so I made sure his tuna fish was ready earlier than it should've been and I was courteous enough to leave the front door unlocked. He spent his whole dinner hour talking to Pooks and asking him how he felt. When I touch him, he feels vibrant and his energy still feels good, so I won't panic unless or until I see another tumor. Here is my plan for the rest of the day. I am going to take a cat nap and then later on if Pooks crawls up to cuddle, I am going to scratch his back for him and then play grab that flab. He has the most adorable pink belly fat and I simply cannot resist. You know how puppies have those bare little tummies? Same thing goes on with them. Also, I love to smell puppy breath. Ah, they don't call me Catnip for nothing. I'll drive ya crazy! Sweet dreams. >^..^      Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

       FOR THE FIRST TIME in my life, I am speechless. Don't worry, that won't keep me from telling you what happened. We finally heard from PT's relative and I am very glad they called back. There was so much tension over unresolved issues and none of us really knew all the details. It took two and a half hours for all three of us to piece everything together and decide what to do next. They will handle things and we are going to do nothing because we simply don't have the heart or the funds to get involved in a legal battle again. Let's just say that the fox got in the hen house, ate all the chickens, their eggs, and now it's refusing to vacate the premises so the house can be sold. It was our job to dislodge them, but our inept lawyer dropped the ball and never even showed up in court on our behalf. The people who fleeced our mutual relative are quite a study in hypocrisy. They're the kind of church people who attend church and then behave like a treacherous pack of wolves for the rest of the week. I apologize for verbally abusing the wolves. There is probably nothing more that can be done. We all got ripped off in a very cruel way. I did hear a couple of things that validated what my intuition told me a long time ago. To think of it, even now, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. My only surprise is that they are such professional liars who are very good at making others look like total assholes, while they are viewed as the instruments of God's inner sanctum. They say grace over meals and read the bible daily. One of them even writes us sick letters saying that they hope God will forgive us for trying to enforce&nbsp;the will. These three people&nbsp;were never supposed to&nbsp;have be included in it in the first place. Here's a hint, they ripped off a very close relative by having them sign a new&nbsp;will knowing that she&nbsp;had been&nbsp;mentally incapacitated by strokes for several&nbsp;years prior to her death. She had no clue as to&nbsp;what year it was or anything having to do with daily reality. They are sickening chicken fuckers. May the chickens forgive me for that comment.  KC called with car trouble again so PT was summoned to diagnose the problem while the car sat on the side of the road in a town thousands of miles away. One of the reasons I married PT is because he can fix anything that goes wrong with any vehicle and he knows exactly how to fix all the stuff around the house that needs repair. I don't even have to nag him. Please don't hate me. I spent&nbsp;14 years with a wing nut who used drain oil into my big cake pans when he changed the oil in his truck, so I've already paid my dues. Muchas Gracias! >^..^  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      I think we are about to have another pet tragedy. Yesterday, I was sitting across the room from my silver shaded white Persian cat who'd just turned 10 on July 27th and I could not quite figure out what was wrong with his bottom lip. I forgot about it until this morning when he came to visit me while I was sitting in "his" recliner. He wasn't too happy to have me feeling around his mouth and when I finally saw what was wrong, my heart sank. I've seen malignant skin cancers on people and that is exactly what this looks like. I pulled his lower lip away from his teeth and it appears to be a melanoma attached to his gum. We do not have funds to pay for chemo and if they remove it, it will grow right back. I don't know what I'm going to do if I have to part with yet another pet this month. I will call the vet today and see if he can validate my diagnosis. I cannot tell my daughter about this at all because he is her " special " cat. Maybe, I am mistaken and this isn't what I think it is. That is just a lie I tell myself, when I know the truth in my heart.  I, for one, am so happy that my girls are back. I am talking about  Sex and The City  which is back on TBS. It does interfere with my ability to watch Jon Stewart on  The Daily Show , but I can always catch him later on in the evening. I asked a friend once if she ever watched Jon Stewart and she said, " Yes, I do and if he'd come over, I'd fuck him ." Okay, apparently she likes her Jon.  We missed a call from a relative of PT's that we haven't heard from in well over a year. I dread opening the can of worms I know is heading our way. Perhaps, I shall stick the worms out on the front porch so they can sizzle in the sun until they dehydrate and blow away. >^..^  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

       MY PARENTS INSTILLED a deep and abiding fear in me regarding all the what if's that a fertile, creative mind can conjure up. As a child, I was convinced that a pack of wolves lived under my bed. I would approach my mother with the most absurd notions and she would always say the same thing. " Well, that might   happen, so you better be careful ." They've never gone on a trip or left the house for longer than an day without calling and reminding me where the wills are kept, how to find all the vehicle keys, and notes regarding their funeral wishes, etc. As a result, I play a game I like to call " Okay, everyone is dead, so now what do I   do?"  I play it from time to time usually after someone looks sickly and I think they might be going down any minute. KC is my designated golden oldie caretaker.  It's my own private game of " Survivor ." KC and I have exhausted all possible combo platters of death served al dente. What if my mother and father die at the same time and PT is incapacitated? Where will I end up? What if PT goes before I do, but my parents both have hardening of the arteries and I have to take care of them in another state? What if I'm left with both of my parents and PT all in varying degrees of kiss of death health? How about if I should bite the poison biscuit first or I'm incapacitated and on life support? What if we're all dead and the pets are out of food and water. Waaah!!!!  My father is not helping this situation at all. He finds morbid articles in the newspaper that he thinks I should read and Mother mails them to me. One of them was about an elderly couple who died within days of each other. The husband died first and their children kept pressuring their mother to get dressed for the funeral. She resisted and said she was not going so the children dressed her and shoved her into the waiting hearse/limomobile. As they got closer to the church, they noticed that their mother was no longer breathing. She had died in the backseat and would indeed not be attending her husband's funeral. My Father thought this was very touching. It's creepy and I don't want to hear any more of these stories.  Mother and I have also had the " if I die before your dad " conversation. If she should be the first to check out, then I am to step off and let my Father put her in a coffin and lower her into the ground in the spot of his choice. If he is already gone, then I am to either donate her body to science for Crohns research or cremate her. If he goes first, then I am to assist her in all funeral arrangements and make sure he is buried in the family plot. If I do cremate her, I am going to put her in a special cremains vase with a small hole in the lid and set it on my desk so I can talk to her. My father does not like this idea because if she isn't buried next to him then he won't have anyone to talk. If they keep messing with me, I'm gonna have my father buried and put my mother's cremains into a brass container which I will then have PT weld to the headstone on the side. I know them. I'll get a phone call from the cemetery people because my parents won't stop fussing and fighting and they're upsetting all the other folks trying to take the eternal dirt nap. >^..^  Copyright© 2004.

      TODAY IS ONLY MARGINALLY BETTER than yesterday. For one thing, I have the Mal au Couer (need to vomit) and I can't. I know it's because I feel sad about the cat and my hormone level is falling. I went out onto the porch to sit for awhile to see if that would help. The other kitties followed me out and were looking all around for Olde Puss. KC never checks his e-mail, so I didn't bother to send one and luckily, he called this afternoon. He flew out last summer for a visit and it had been years since he'd seen Olde Puss. He bathed and groomed him while he was here, so he was really sad to hear about it.  PT must be more upset about this than he is letting on because he was talking about something he heard Paul Harvey say on the radio when he drove home for lunch. He said that dogs understand everything that's said to them and have the mentality of a 4-5 year old child. Candypants is considered to be one of the most intelligent breeds of dogs as far as thinking, planning, and understanding verbal commands go. Originally the Great Pyrenees dogs were used in France to guard sheep from wolves and bears. If you get a group of them together, they will form a sentry and signal each other when danger is near. They are skilled at noticing when something is out of place which is why they are such good watchdogs and excellent trackers. I've told PT a million times that all our pets know what we're saying to them, but since Paul Harvey said it; it's a for real deal all of a sudden. PT said he was going to have to stop calling Candypants "dumb ass." The dog weighs 125 pounds, but he's still able to sneak up from behind and scare the shit out of me. He does not have the eyes of a dog. They are a very light color of brown that you don't see too often in animals. All he has to do is look at me and I know what he wants. His stare is quite intense as well. I'm sorry I'm so boring today, but this is what's going on in my life at the moment and I am feeling irritable.  Certain people, pets, and things are irreplaceable, so I try to enjoy them while I can. Everything has always felt temporary to me. My mother says that if you can't love her and be kind to her when she is alive, then don't show up at her funeral with a handful of flowers. My Grandmother Jewell said that no matter where you go, there you are. She was referring to people who run away from their problems which was pretty cool for a 97 year old woman. I think PT might have the best idea. His coping method involves a pint of chocolate milk, some doughnuts, and the ability to simply wait out the storm. If I can get involved in something that requires an intense mental focus, then I can find relief. Sleeping is also a form of relaxation for me and no matter what's bothering me, I wake up with a workable plan to take care of whatever is ailing me.  Since I'm talking about grandmothers, I really enjoyed my maternal grandmother Minnie. She lost her husband early and was left with five children to raise on her own in the 30's. She had no education, so she worked the laundries and cafes. Grandmother Minnie had her fun which is probably why she was able to carry on and remain happy. There were several things she loved: Beer, country music, snuff, and her knick knacks. Any small token or gift was extremely precious to her. My mother and her very religious sister hated one of Grandma Minnie's treasures. She had male friends and one of them brought her an upright ceramic hand with the middle finger sticking up. Minnie was aware that this disgusted her daughters, but she was also pleased that it did. Secretly, I was also thrilled. Years later, when she was taken to the nursing home due to a stroke, the sisters descended on her home and my aunt took that ceramic hand out of the case, got a hammer, and smashed it to bits. I would love to have it sitting in my own china cabinet. Who am I kidding? I'd have it out someplace in plain view. I must make do with her snuff box and a tiny snuff spoon along with some costume jewelry and buttons that nobody else wanted. Her daughters had no idea that the buttons from the thirties are collector items or I'm sure I wouldn't have gotten them. This still makes me smile. I guess I loved her so much because I rarely got to see her and she was so different. When she died, she had a simple graveside service and the only people in attendance were me, my children, my parents, and the aunt who smashed her symbol of nonconformity. Minnie still comes around in my dreams and we visit. >^..^  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      SEVERAL DAYS AGO, a massive rat snake tried to break into our enclosed back porch intending to crush the breath out of our elderly cat and then eat him. I view the world through the lens of omens, intuition, and premonitions and when that snake showed up, I should've known Olde Puss was on his way out. He died this morning at the age of 13. We think he had another stroke. Most cats live for 9 to 15 years, but some live on into their 20's and a couple have lived to be 34-36 years. There's a myth that pets and humans die during the three months prior to their birthdate or sometime during the three months following it. I always read the obituaries in the newspaper and it's interesting to see that this is often the case. My theory regarding pets has been that the more you have, the less painful it will be when you lose one. That is total bullshit. I have attachments to all of them and still have other cats of varying ages and only one of the others is elderly. She looks the same as the day I brought her home as a 3 month old kitten. The others will be with me for at least another ten plus years.  I guess the only thing left to tell is the story of how Olde Puss came to live with us. PT, my three children and I were living in a different state when an invitation to the Cat Fanciers Annual Cat Show came via snail mail. No one really showed any interest in going except for me. I was determined to go because I wanted to see a real live Maine Coon cat in the flesh and fur. PT reluctantly agreed to take us with the understanding that we were to leave as soon as I looked at all the Maine Coon cats. I found them and one breeder offered to let me take a beautiful little female home as a pet, but I said, "Thanks, but we already have two cats." That's when PT decided that since we were there, we might as well look at all the cats. Every breed was represented. PT asked me if I wanted the Maine Coon and I said I'd think about it, but I was really ready to go and he wasn't. The were twenty different cages of Black Persians with amber eyes on the last row. You really couldn't tell one from the other, but he saw Olde Puss(not his real name) and fell in love. His owner came right over, made us all wash our hands with some kind of disinfectant, put on a paper robe and some latex gloves. She then reached in and placed the cat in my arms. He was squirming and obviously didn't want me to hold him, so I handed him over to PT. The cat settled right down, purred and did all the cute cat crap they do to endear themselves to a prospective buyer. We bought him for 50 bucks without papers and got some very detailed instructions. He was never to be let outside, he preferred to sleep at the end of the bed, and if he was unhappy, we were to call her immediately and she would come pick him up and take him back home. I was to write and let her know how he was doing every month. Around Christmas time, I sent her a Christmas card and a picture of him and she sent me a short note saying she guessed he was ours now. He had a stroke a few years ago, but this didn't slow him down until about a month ago. All my pets are connected to very specific time periods in my life with all the attendant memories attached to them. When they die, I feel like a part of me goes right along with them. I sat out on the porch last night trying to comfort him and hopefully made his passing a little easier. The other cats stood in the doorway staring at him, but refusing to come out. Cats are very psychic and I know they knew what was going on. Smokey (our Maine Coon) finally came out and sat right by me. He'd go over and stare into Olde Puss's face to see if he was still breathing. Olde Puss's real name is very distinctive which is why I'm not using it today. Anyone who knows us would recognize the name and figure out who I am in short order. Smokey is a newcomer and disappears when people visit which is rare. We don't out him because he's like me and wants to be left alone. It's a rainy dreary day with grey skies and it does nothing to ease the mood around here. >^..^  Copyright© 2004.

      KC IS ALWAYS GIVING ME the speech about how I need to take better care of myself and get more exercise. He's usually sitting around smoking a cigarette while downing a one liter bottle of zero cal, high caffeine soda the whole time he's lecturing me. I have an exercycle sitting one foot away from me which I'm using for a clothes rack at the moment. Don't want to upset the feng shui back here.  PT and I are both CSI nutkins watching Cold Case and all programs of that genre. We probably know every possible way in which a person can die. If I get even so much as a bellyache after drinking a cup of hot tea, I get suspicious. Should that lead to violent vominations and hospitalization, there's going to be a full investigation for arsenic poisoning. PT's just gonna have to figure out some other plan to get rid of me.  You know sometimes I wonder what the librarian must think of PT as he's in just about every week checking out yet another serial killer/murder mystery book. I'm the one they probably refer to as that woman who checks out "all the weird stuff". I asked PT to pick up a book for me. The librarian's helper pulled out the book and as she was getting it all checked out, she said, "I can't imagine why she would need to read a book like this!" PT just stood there and said nothing as usual. The name of the book was "The Secret Life Of Plants" so kill me already. I was doing research and it would be none of that library bitch's business if I had checked out "Madonna's Giant Book Of Twats." In fact, I wish I'd thought of that first. Miss Library Pooferbottom would've had to put on special latex gloves, go back into the secret vault room, and place it in a brown paper bag before handing it over to PT. She wouldn't be able to make further eye contact since they both now knew that I was going to be looking at twats for the next few days; researching the many moods of Madonna or is it Esther now?  I'm not used to people behaving like the north end of southbound goat, but I normally make them wish they hadn't gone to all that trouble. Gets pretty embarrassing when they receive the big chill the next time they run into me. I play the "I can't see you and you don't exist game." I have on ongoing feud right now with one person and everytime she runs into PT she checks with him to see if I still hate her. He simply says he doesn't know and then he visits with her. I find this highly amusing as I was gracious enough to let her know exactly what she did, well over a year ago, and that our relationship was indeed over. She has more friends than anyone I know, so I fail to see why she can't let me go in peace and move on. She even agrees with me that she did a really bad thing. If she liked me all that much, she wouldn't have done what she did to end the friendship in the first place. I don't hate her, but I'd had enough. Right now, I don't consider myself friend material due to the fact that I'm not in the market for one and it wouldn't be fair to the other person. Besides, I have important research to do. >^..^  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      Hey you people at Blogger! Is this sucka broke or what?&nbsp; I will be back shortly to check on this and it better be right. You kept me up until 2 a.m. messing around&nbsp;with all this and it's still broken.&nbsp; The Catnipper   THE CATFISH PULLED OUT of the pond last night weighed 17 pounds. Like I said yesterday, Old Moby is still in there somewhere. Also, KC informed me that that song with the words I thought were everybody in the club gets tits  is actually  everybody in the club gets tipsy. So, now I know.   How Catnip Is Feeling : I'm moody and I've convinced myself that I will never feel good again. I feel so bad now that I don't dare rachet my hormones down another notch just yet. Laying in the bed all day and night could become a brand new hobby for me.   Who Is The Butt Rash In Your Life?  Is there someone you just cannot stand, but yet you must deal with them anyway? When you wake up in the morning and you don't find their names in the Obits or hospital admissions report in the newspaper, does it ruin the rest of your day?  Are words, alone, inadequate to describe the way you loathe everything about them?  Do you hate them with the white hot intensity of thousand suns? Have you dreamed of what life would be like if they weren't in yours?  Well, this may be the answer you've been looking for. It's impersonal, messy, smelly, and vile. Too bad, Blogger can't get their act together, so I could show you where to find Send A Poop Dot Com by using their dandy permalink tool.   My mother hopes she's dies prior to seeing me get published if that should ever happen. I've tried to tell her that it's a whole new world out there and I'm not as over the top as she thinks. Hell, I think I finally made it to nearly normal. The other day I found out that a brand new children's book came out and it's called Walter The Farting Dog. Walter farts too much and his owners decide to take him to the pound the next day. That evening two men come by to rob the house and aren't able to finish the job due to Walter's toxic farts, so they run away. Walter gets to stay and everyone is happy. THE END. My mother probably doesn't have anything to worry about, however, she has at the very least ten more years to go as all the women on her side of the family live about 84 years. This fact just occured to me yesterday. I won't ever be ready for her to go. That means I would have at least 30-40 more years without my mother if she does go in her mid 80's. She's the only person who has been in my life on a consistent basis. There is no other person on earth who can say that. My father is alive, but he doesn't know me or anything about me. He wanted a boy and when he didn't get what he wanted on the first try, there was a decision made that there would be no more children. I wanted brothers and sisters very badly and I bugged my mother about it until she finally told me that my father didn't want any more. My father didn't bother to hide his contempt for me either. He must not have known that the father determines the sex of the child. Perhaps, I will enlighten him one day. All, I can say is that I'm glad to be a female and I was determined that I would have a family with children. Not one child, but children like a real family. Mother says that when I was growing up she just thought I was a difficult child. She didn't realize that I was down for the count emotionally. I never had the words to tell anyone what was going on inside. I remember a friend asking me what I was feeling one time and I just sat there unable to find the any words at all. I'm still a difficult person, but now at least I know what I'm feeling and I can tell someone. I went from shy, quiet, and demure to an in-your-face woman. Failing that, I will try to drive you out of your mind, hence my moniker, Catnip. These days I just mainly want to be left alone to spin my stories and work on my writing. I'll just be glad when I am totally free of the pony piss pills. >^..^  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

        PT WAITED UNTIL AROUND 7:30 last evening to tell me that some of his co-workers would be coming by to fish in our pond. I don't like surprises. No one comes to our house very often because we live in such a remote area. You can barely see our carpet due to all the loose hair from the dog and cats. I've basically given up on having a pristine home as long as Candypants is alive. He will probably outlive me and probably will have something to do with my eventual demise. Everything outside looked disheveled as well. Weeds growing in the middle of your pea gravel sidewalk does not say Welcome To Our Home. In situations like this, my intestines start twisting themselves into balloon animals. I felt a poodle forming in my colon which led to poodle farts. I threw on some clothing that had been hanging on my rarely used exercycle and tried to make myself appear presentable and unruffled.  PT's friends managed to catch one gargantuan catfish and some other smaller fish. Our pond is fully stocked so there are probably some real Mobys swimming around in there. One of PT's co-workers/friends said that the next time they came out, they would bring a their B-B-Q pit and cook freshly caught fish for everyone. Here's the thing. If they were to view what goes on in that pond, they might not want to go to all that trouble. I just know I won't be able to eat anything that comes out of there. There's goose shit, duck shit, snake shit, heron shit, turtle shit, and fish shit in that water. To drink the water alone means a three week shitfest for some unsuspecting soul. At one time, we had a goose named Emily Dirty Butt because she was always soiling herself. She swam in the pond for a few years, so I know some of her "stuff" is still cruising around in there somewhere. PT treats the pond with some type of fish fertilizer to make the fish grow and breed which can't be good for a person to ingest. Life just didn't used to be this complicated, but back then I didn't have access to the intimate details of pond life either. Ignorance truly is bliss.  I'm watching some kind of MTVish summer hits show or something like that on Fox. There's a group of rappers singing what sounds like "everybody in the club gets tits." Surely, that is not what I'm hearing, but the camera IS zooming in on every huge pair of mammaries in the place. Their original purpose was to provide liquid nutrition for babies. Now, they are used as a tool to snare men and make other women feel homicidally jealous. I feel another balloon animal forming, so I must go. >^..^      Copyright© 2004.

        I SEEM TO BE UNABLE to tear myself away from watching some extremely graphic footage of tornadoes on the weather channel that have set down in different states. I've yet to see one up close and personal, but now I'm no longer afraid of them. I figure that when it's time for The Person In Charge to punch my ticket, then I may as well go along quietly. I hadn't talked to my mother in several days, so I called to see what was going on in her world. I think we may have been on the phone for five whole minutes before my father butted in and made her get off PDQ (pretty damned quick). He'd been watching the weather channel, too, and decided that she better hang up in case lightening struck during a severe storm that was heading their way. It was not there yet, but it was coming. We live in different states, and yet my father can still make my blood simmer. I'm glad that I am not in the kind of love that turns one into a door mat. Remember that I said this, because I'm gonna say it again a couple of paragraphs later on.  I decided that I would spend the rest of my day working on my Britney Spears article so I can post it on my astrology blog. She's actually a very complicated person to read. I, also, have to find data from her actual life to illustrate that what I am saying is indeed based on fact and that I didn't just pull it out of my ass. It takes a great deal of time to put it all into a logical, readable form, but I need a challenge in my life and it appears that this is what I chose. You know who I think would make a totally cool boyfriend for Britney? Kid Rock. Yep. That would do it. After the Justin heartache, she's really not been seen with anybody that could be considered A-list material. I expect more for my Britney. I may be an older woman, but I know hot when I see it. Kid Rock isn't exactly hot, but if he can lure Pamela Anderson into the sack then he's got something worth investigating. I know the first place I'd look if I were called upon to work the case. Please don't tell anyone, but I think that he wears those hats because without them, he looks just like Jesus. Furthermore, I used to work for a plastic surgeon and if Kid would let one of those Swan doctors do a little rhinoplasty on his snooter, he would be a righteous Divine Dude. I like my men pretty with long hair, but they must keep their penis. It's purely selfish of me to want Kid Rock to have his nose done on my account because he likes to drink way too much for my tastes, which brings me to my next topic of the day.  KC called all upset because his Sigother stole 60 bucks out of his pant's pocket while he was asleep. It was money that was to go towards paying the rent. He drove around checking out the local pubs to see if Sig was there, but couldn't find him. Sigother had very cleverly turned off his cell phone so nobody could call and find out that he was out dicking around spending the rent money. I hate these calls because I want to hop on my broom and fly to an undisclosed location west of where I live and kick the holy living dog crap out of Sigother. He doesn't love KC and is just using him for all he's worth. KC's father (my ex) and Sigother have the same first name and they behave in precisely the same egotistical, selfish manner. I think that's what really pisses me off. I know how this little fairy tale ends, but KC is still in love. I was not in love after the first year of my fourteen year marriage to my children's father, but I had them to think of. It was that and the fact that I just couldn't figure out how I'd afford all the bills and get furniture. Furniture kept me in a hellish relationship for fourteen years! I told myself all kinds of lies like who's gonna want me with three children, I'm too old at 30 something, too fat, too everything. One day I just packed up and left and that was how things ended. Okay, here it comes. I'm glad that I have never been in the kind of love that sucks the very soul out of you. PT had to met all sorts of criteria or our marriage was not gonna happen. We both married with the idea that if it works out fine, but if it doesn't, then at least we tried. It was still difficult and on some days it still is. The big difference is that I don't have muddy footprints on my back anymore. I vowed that I would never allow anyone to shoot my horse out from underneath me ever again. Sigother is likely to become Insigother in short order. If you aren't loved by someone, it's better to face it and move on than to waste your life while you pretend that you matter to them. People say all kinds of things, but it's their actions that tell me everything I need to know about them. I'd e-mail Sigother one of my famous screaming flamers, but he's drunk and wouldn't remember it in the morning. Well, back to Miss Britney and what makes her tick. Her, I can understand.  >^..^    Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

       I'VE&nbsp;SPENT&nbsp;THE Majority&nbsp;of&nbsp;my day hunting up data on Miss Britney Spears as I am writing an article on her for my astro poo blog. Astrology has been my vice since I was in my early twenties. One year for my birthday, my brother-in-laws bought me a pack of Tarot cards and a book called " The Conscious Unconsciousness of Odd Bodkins ." I was a real dummy for throwing that book out later on since it is now a collectible. I was also gifted with the Baghvad Gita, which I dutifully read from cover to cover. I especially liked the blue-skined Krishna and Garuda; the elephant-headed god. At Christmas, they gave me a beginner's astrology book which began my career as a serious student of the craft. I did charts for 30 years and then gave it up, except for those special folks I run into from time to time and family members. I am not talking about those silly sun sign reports that you see in the newspapers and magazines. I do professional readings with a person's own exact date and time of birth along with their place of birth. I liked the challenge and I belonged to an astrologer's group that did readings on celebrities and other famous folks. We'd each post our analysis of the person of the month on a website to see what everyone thought. I decided to lay it all down for awhile because it was so time consuming and I never charged anyone. I guess I was ready to move on like I do from time to time and now I am right back where I left off. That is the true test of love and devotion. Can you leave something alone and walk away from it altogether or do you return to it again and again?  Just recently, I realized that I had originally abandoned organized religion and then subtituted all things metaphysical in it's place. After reading some books by Zecharia Sitchin, my beliefs have undergone yet another change. Giving up my long-held personal beliefs and not liking what I learned was very disturbing to me on an emotional level. I am now in a state of flux waiting to catch the next wave. With me, it's a neverending journey. I will still be questing for answers until I draw my last breath. As soon as I get comfortable, then life throws me a curveball to get me moving again. You know what? I'm still shocked each and every time it happens.  I haven't attended church since I left home except for a little lapse in judgement I made a few years ago. I enjoy the freedom that I have to enjoy my spiritual beliefs without tying myself up with any particular dogma. Just in case it matters, I am not an atheist. I always made it clear to my children that they could make their own choices regarding religion. KC wasn't truly convinced and once he went to watch one of his friends preach at church. He absolutely forbade anyone to tell me about it. It's funny now that a child would be afraid to tell their mother that they'd been to church like it was some major dealio. I've told him to do as he pleases and cover all bases if necessary including getting himself dunked.  PT's family were all members of fundamental Baptist sects. Somehow, he managed to escape all of that dogma and refused to be baptized. I've offered to dunk him out in the pond, but he said he doesn't feel the need for that type of thing. I will tell you this only because I know my zany cousin will never read my blog nor is she even aware that I have one. She baptizes people in the creek at the back of her property. If it was good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for them. When I was just a tadpole in my mother's womb, she felt a profound need to be baptised ASAP. I remember being around age four and announcing to everyone within earshot that they better get to church or we were all headed straight to H-E-L-L. How annoying must I have been? I am so glad I outgrew all of that.  I've been catching up on all the South Park episodes I missed especially the ones of Cartman's anal probes and shit like that there. My mother would have a stroke and die on the spot if she saw even a single episode of that or Sex and The City. She is only 19 years older than me, but we are polar opposites. KC is more down to earth and doesn't go chasing after exotica. He sees enough of it right where he lives so things don't weigh too heavily on him. The happiest time of my life was when I was a mom surrounded by my children. They've all scattered to the winds, but they are good about calling and visiting. >^..^    Copyright© 2004.

        They say one live rat snake equals 300 dead rats. I say one dead rat snake equals one live Olde Puss.      HAVE YOU EVER been blissfully unconscious in your own bed dreaming of Divine Dudes or whatever it is that frosts your cake only to be awakened rather rudely? You wake up with your heart pounding and it isn't because you finally got your mitts on Divine Dude, but because you know something is wrong somewhere in the universe and it's getting closer and closer. I was on red alert, but I didn't know why. We keep one elderly cat on a very secure, highly pleasant, screened in back porch with a double reinforced door so Candypants doesn't tear it off the hinges when he has a panic attack and wants in NOW! Olde Puss is incontinent and refuses to use the litterbox, so we had to make a decision and since he's otherwise okay, he gets to enjoy the birdies and all the sounds of nature and his accidents don't happen in the house anymore.  PT had been watching the big tele and looked out through the glass french doors directly onto the porch and saw what he knew could not be a snake climbing the screen door and yet it was a snake. A big slimey, tongue darting, fang bearing, tail rattling, six-foot long snake who was looking for a way to get into the cat sanctuary. PT got up, grabbed the 22 rifle, went outside, and blasted away until he thought he had killed it. I sleep with ear plugs because every little noise wakes me, but I didn't hear anything prior to waking. I was, however, already awake when PT appeared in the doorway looking pale. He is 6'5" and weighs in right below the 300 lb. mark on the scales so there aren't that many people or things that bother him, except for moi. A happy face should be right here. I wasn't the cause since I'd been napping with the Hairballs. At least I, now, knew why I had been so rudely awakened. I asked PT if he had disposed of the body and he said he wanted to wait until the next day. Translation: PT is extremely afraid of snakes so it would be up to me to get rid of the carcass. I grabbed the flashlight, stood at the porch door and chunked rocks at the snake to make sure it was really dead. It wasn't, so I moved back inside the porch and went to the section where it was laying on the otherside of the wall and I shined the light right on it. It's size was rather intimidating. I held the flashlight while PT shot ten more bullets into it's head and we stopped for the night. I like to know what's breaking into my back porch, so I Googled on over to big black snakes. It looked like a rattle snake and yet it had no rattles. I finally found IT and IT was a rat snake which is&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp; mistaken for a chicken snake. I'd seen those around chicken coops when I was growing up. The rat snake eats rats, mice, birds, rabbits, and squirrels. They are capable of crushing their prey, so I can only assume he wanted to eat Olde Puss! I also learned that they can scale trees up to 40 feet tall, hiss, swish their tails so it sounds like a rattle, and bite you if you don't run away fast enough. Forget about hoeing them to death or picking one up. Now, that I am thoroughly informed as to their habits, I will never go outside again unarmed because we have a lot of trees and I just know one of them is waiting to jump on me when I go out to get in any of our vehicles. I just hope there isn't some other breed of snake we haven't heard of lying amongst the spanish moss in our trees. >^..^    Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens.

       WHY, OH WHY, CAN"T I JUST LEAVE THINGS ALONE? My blog wasn't hurting anybody. In fact, I don't think a single person even knows I'm here yet. I did spend a couple of hours applying to different search engines because I had four different blogs. It's just like adopting a pet, I can't stop myself until I am completely overwhelmed with way too many and had to cut it down to just one. Minnow Paws was the only one that ended up being listed so I combined it with some posts from one of the other blogs. While I was out cruising the Google Highway, I found a blog that I read quite often. The Blogmistress had a very nicely tricked out Blog Profile listing complete with a photo of herself. Well, that was all it took. I buzzed right over to Hello and downloaded their nifty picture uploading, sharing, do everything thingee and decided to name Bloggerbot as My Friend (imaginary like all my friends) as well. I don't know what I did or which button I clicked on, but before I knew it one of my blogs was in serious trouble. The profile, my post list, and my archives all took a trip down south on the sidebar and were not where I had left them. I tried to put them back in their place, but they refused to budge so I did what I always do in these situations. I tried to trick Blogger into giving me a new template just like my old one thinking that surely that would fix everything. No, no, no! There was only one thing left to do and that was to sneak back into the bowels of Blogger to the template section and go shopping for a different new one. I thought I had already seen all of Bloggers selections, but they had several more that were not there when I made my original choices. I picked one out, slapped it up there, deleted some crap and it was working and looking good in about ten minutes. Whew! The only problem is that now that I've seen The Other Templates, I kind of, sort of, want to change one of my other blogs. I'm saying right here that I will not dick around with anything else. Unfortunately, I really want to leave things alone, but I'm not sure I can now that I've seen the secret stash of templates. I wonder when they will stop tinkering with things because yesterday I noticed that we have some more choices to make concerning text color and some other really nice additions.  I'm sitting back here in my lair with three very comfortable overstuffed chairs lined up in a row with a comfy fat feline laying in each one. Should that be laying or lying? I know they aren't telling me any lies, so it must be laying. Anyway, I brought the chairs back here for me to sit in and so PT could also have a place to sit in case he ever wandered by. He did say he came to the doorway one time to ask me something, but he turned right around and left because I was wearing my headphones, singing, and typing. How awful could it have been for him to leave feeling so traumatized? I'm the first to admit that I cannot sing and, yet, I do because I hang around solo most of the time. The critters are all used to me, but come to think of it I do see them giving me strange looks when I sing. It's almost like they're in pain or something. Maybe, that's something else I should leave alone. >^..^    Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

       I AM MISERABLE due to the Egyptian ant plague that has descended upon my palace. They're frolicking in PT's dirty clothes in the laundry hamper, hanging onto my clothes in the closet, milling around in an empty trash basket in the middle bathroom, and now they have run shit out of luck. Yesterday, PT used Super Duper Ant Destroyer in the house which killed them all dead inside. I got up this a.m. and found a note regarding their status. PT sprayed outside the house today and apparently he didn't understand that they would simply run into our house for safety. PT knows if he uses any kind of ant killer spray that I am to be informed first so I can clear away everything from that side of the kitchen. He felt that he was capable and did not follow MY RULES. My nose is so sensitive that I can smell a mouse fart from 3 miles away which means that I can really smell the odor of the spray he used. He, also, made unauthorized additions to the dishwasher. Namely, the ant infested dishes, etc. from the sink and the sink mats. It only makes sense that if ants wade through ant spray and die en masse in the sink amongst the dishes then that deadly stuff will be on them too. The dishes underwent total decontamination before they went into the dishwasher, but PT slung the infested sink mats on the top shelf with our drinking glasses and such! The mats are now lying on the front porch bench after being sprayed down with the water hose. The murderous rays of the sun will have to burn off any leftover ant killer. I've washed the dishes twice now and put them away, so I can reload the dishwasher myself before PT commits any further health department offences. He watches Dr. Phil, but apparently he doesn't pay any attention to what Phil says about letting the woman nest and leaving things alone that are clearly her domain. What if I went outside to change his oil in his big old truck and poured the oil into the transmission fluid hole instead of the one where the oil is supposed to go which I HAVE DONE by the way. I didn't know him then, but I guess there's no law keeping me from doing it to him now. Hmm.  After lunch was over, I was standing near the sink watching Simba get a drink of water. She's very tiny and hyperactive and uses her paws in ways I haven't seen other cats do before. After her thirst was quenched, she started dipping one paw into the water and rubbing it all over her face, her ears, and then the rest of her body. She also uses the same paw to pull out one kitty kibble at a time and it takes her forever to eat. At night, she comes in and puts a paw on my face or sticks her head under my book until I acknowledge her existence and pet her. She and her litter mate are very fast and there is not a bird, mouse, or lizard that can survive their ambushes. Candypants is pacing and hyperventilating again due to a storm system blowing through. I prefer to count the seconds between the time I see the lightening and hear the thunder to judge it's distance from me and my computer. Once it gets too close, I start shutting off everything including the phones as we have been struck twice. The electricity came in through the phone lines and destroyed our televisions which are hooked up to a satellite system. It fried all the phones and burned up some of my computer boards. Blue flames were actually shooting out of the plug outlets.  There's a comfort in being old/older because you know you're either halfway through or at the very least a whole lot closer than you were to moving on to the great beyond. Nobody notices older people and if they do it's usually to say something negative. It's kind of nice actually because I can anonymously move through life without being noticed except by children. When I was out of the house the other day, a little girl sitting in a shopping cart pointed to me and said: " There's a lady !" You can't blame her for thinking that as she was only 3 or 4. She said, " Hi " and I greeted her and talked to her as I walked by. I'm a female, but I'm no longer a Lady. Maybe, it was because I was all decked out in purple wearing all my bling bling or is it blang when there's a lot?  When I worked at Hospice, I had a lot of conversations with the dying and their families and I learned why the dying felt such a peace within. It was because they had done all they came here to do and it was simply a good place to stop. They die on their own schedule and I've seen them hold out until the timing was just right. The sad part was when the family members were so worn out that they longed for things to be over as quickly as possible. It sounds cruel, but I understood how emotionally gruelling it was. I used to believe in reincarnation and I guess I still do deep down. I will tell you this much though, I plan to run to the farthest ends of the netherworld and stay there for all of eternity before I allow anyone to make me set foot on this whirling dirtball ever again. I know some spiritual loopholes and I'd rather serve as a Guide or something comparable until the Sun chooses to shine no more. My inner life has always been much richer and more rewarding than life out in the regular daily grind of the world at large. It bores me and it always has. For years, I kept thinking that people and things shouldn't be the way they really were and that something was all wrong. I didn't know I was the one who was out of sync until recently. I always try to find meaning in the smallest of things and everytime something comes along to crush my spirit, I drive myself nuts trying to figure out why a certain event happened. I, once, had to wait five years to learn the real reason why something that seemed so good and so right at the time ended so badly or why it had ended at all. When the answer finally landed in my lap, I understood that I had never belonged in that situation in the first place and had I stayed, I would've paid for it in terms of major health consequences. I find joy in my family and pets and maybe that's why I'm still hanging around. There is one final goal that I'm reluctant to let go of, but it too may remain just out of my reach. >^..^    Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

        WHEN I WOKE UP yesterday morning, I smelled something dreadful, but I thought it was just due to my lack of hormones because I knew PT was fixing breakfast and it wouldn't smell like that. Before you all rise up in anger and jealousy, I am not a pampered princess. It's just that PT hates my cooking, especially the way I cook breakfast. He was raised on sticks of butter, lard, salt, and a lot of sugar in his vegetables which were then deep-fried. My mother cooked delicious, nutritious, well-balanced meals. No lard, no sugar, and very little butter involved. PT bought a George Foreman grill in an attempt to make my life easier when I cook lunch and supper. It is now the $100.00 bacon cooker because he gets his hands on it first and I don't feel like scrubbing it more than once a day. Screwed as usual.  I drug myself out of bed and the air reeked as if a thousand vinegaroons had descended on our kitchen. Turns out we have ants in our pants and our kitchen again this year. PT had sprayed Heinz cleaning vinegar all over the place and there were pools of ants floating around the kitchen countertops and others running for their lives. His theory is that they come in looking for water. I find this hard to believe as we have birdbaths outside as well as 3 separate human bathrooms with water galore.  Yesterday was the appointed day for my monthly airing out when PT insists that I get into the big truck to go shopping. I know this isn't politically correct, but I can't stand shopping unless it's via the internet and even then I don't enjoy it like I should.&nbsp; I allowed myself to be lured out of the house with the promise of a nice chinese buffet and some ice cream later on if my behavior was really good in the stores. To be honest, I acted like a total ass at Costco and still got the ice cream later on.&nbsp; I told PT yesterday that one specific store that we would be going to wouldn't be there anymore. I've given him very accurate precognitive information in the past, but he says he doesn't believe in all that shit. Well, maybe he should start. I know that he wishes he had listened to me when I warned him that he was ripe for an accident and he poo pooed me. I stood there and watched him step off of a ladder 15 minutes later and fracture his ankle which has never healed up and still plagues him to this day. Sure enough, we went to the place that I told him wouldn't be there anymore and it wasn't. We stopped to find out where they'd moved to and then spent two hours circling all the streets with president's names in search of the elusive Hayes Street. Rutherford B. Hayes was nowhere to be found. I am sad to report that TCBY has also gone out of business and another a well-known ice cream chain is advertising low carb ice cream. I was appalled. PT says that Krispy Kreme doughnuts is having financial problems with all the Dr. Fatkins insanity going on. It will go the way of the low-fat diet and will be found lying in the abandoned diet bone yard alongside all the others.  We decided to take a break and go to lunch early. It was so early that I missed out on some of my favorite things at the buffet. I live for their really long green beans with sesame seeds all over them. Our waitress came by to take our drink orders of one water and one iced tea. PT was loading up on buffet goodies when the drinks arrived. His tea was very anemic looking, but he didn't say anything. Things were quiet and uncrowded until about 11:30 a.m. when a whole herd of mechanics all dressed in grey showed up from the Dodge house. I do a fair amount of people watching to see if anything looks blogworthy. I was not dissappointed. A group of four very obvious college Frat Boyz were checking out all the females in the place and making comments. I was already watching them, so when they turned around to assess me, all they saw was a woman with her chin resting on top of her hand adorned with an Italian charm bracelet and some major bling bling on her fingers. I smiled and they found another victim which turned out to be Miss Thang with her Crimson Killer/Drop Blood hair color going on and some clothing very worthy of comments and stares. One of the Frats was so bold as to give her a very thorough T&amp;A scan and then as soon as she headed for the buffet, he was out of his chair tailgaiting her like a horned up dawg. She never even knew it, but I did which is why you're hearing all about it now. The Frat Boyz weren't quite finished because two of them went over to the desert bar and as one of them was trying to pick out some yummies to put on his plate, another one was trying to yank the guys shorts down to his ankles. Once again, I was staring right at them and the dude stopped.&nbsp; Maybe, they were creeped out by my smirky smile.  The hunkiest waiter showed up to see if PT would like some more water. I intervened and explained that he was drinking tea even if it did look like water. Mr. Divine Dude came right back with the tea and I caught the scent of his cologne. Woweee......He was tall, swarthy, and charming. PT thought the guy was probably Italian or Greek. He had no accent at all, so I'm stumped. Like it matters what recipe they used to make him. I'd just like to get a copy of it, so I could start full-scale manufacturing. Stepford Wives meet my Stepford Men. It was finally time to go and I got one last treasure for the day. Our cashier was a young chinese man. His name tag read: &nbsp;Wang.&nbsp; Priceless!&nbsp; >^..^   Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.    &nbsp;

        The genius of Einstein lead to Hiroshima. &nbsp; Pablo Picasso   I WOULD LIKE nothing more than to tell you, dear reader, that life is a wonderful, fantaboo journey. Feel free to insert any adjectives that you may prefer here _____. My identity is going to remain a secret simply because I've revealed way too much in prior attempts to find just the right nest for my Blog. There is something about having a blog to come home to and for said blog to look nice and inviting. This may be the closest I'll ever come to seeing my words in print in any medium, although I do have a desire to be published at least once. I am anticipating my Martha Mitchell moment when I will write my  Gone With The Wind . I've not done one thing with my life that I feel is noteworthy other than to survive it. Maybe, that's all there is.  Organized religion has not met my needs to know all the intimate details and attributes of The Creator who supposedly is in charge of all that goes on in the world. Ministers stand in the pulpit every Sunday morning telling their congregation that God has a plan for each and every one of them. I would like to be the first to say that I do not care for his plan for my life if indeed that is the case. I'd like a second opinion and perhaps some tweaking done on my plan. I need more perks and less crappola. I don't mind the idea of God, but I do mind what is written about him by mortal man. He seems to have an awful lot of human tendencies and habits which causes me to want to hide from the man. That's another thing. I do not think God is a man, but rather a genderless being. Really, I think, The Creator should have given more thought to the matter and just created men. Leave women out of it entirely. A whole bunch of men, so they could all do whatever guy things they wanted to do and things would be just oh so lovely for them. I have a feeling that there would indeed be only one man left on earth had that been the initial plan because you know how guys are. Somebody has to be the self-appointed alpha male and a war is needed in order to achieve this goal.  The thing that finally cured my religious/metaphysical longing to find out the truth would have to be the Zecharia Sitchin books. Should you read any of them, you will have a big reaction which may keep you up for nights on end. It was just like when I found out that Santa Claus wasn't real and then it took two more years for me to understand that the Easter Bunny was also a crock. You know, I'd love to be that innocent again. No wait, that's what got me into all that trouble in the 80's. Oh well. Anyway, I found his explanations regarding man's advent on earth and the truth about where we actually came from to be more compelling than anything I'd ever read anywhere. I finally understood the Bible and other ancient writings completely which lead me to the knowledge that the Bible was secondary to the writings of the Sumerians and actually sprung from them. If you are a staunch, radical, Christian, please do not waste your time e-mailing me big flamers because I will simply delete them. I'm not offended by what you believe, so maybe you can give my point of view the same respect. That's just in case somebody should accidentally find their way to this blog and read it. Just in case. Just be glad that I didn't post my gif of Jesus in bunny ears. I've been baptized so back off.  >^..^  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      I really don't want to admit this, but I did watch the entire reality show called  The Swan . It's against all my principles and rules to do such a thing, but I did it and I enjoyed it. I've known who was going to win for the last two weeks due to my psychic impairment. Trust me, it you had it you wouldn't consider it a gift either. Anyway, there were a couple of other girls that I felt should of at least been in the final top five. They didn't make it, but I did approve of the chosen Swan.   Here's what intrigues me. Even the loser Swans are hot and they are going back to their   real  lives and I wonder what that will be like for their families. This has to be a concern for the husbands. They are now married to someone other than the person they pledged to love till their dying day or until they both got sick of each other. I did not see one hunky husband in the whole group and now the guys have eye candy on their hands. Jealous men are not a pretty sight and there is no way a Swan wouldn't make a regular old goose jealous. Other men will start checking out their wives and then they'll have to be on constant guard in case someone tries to steal her away. Just wait until the Swans get that sacred envelope from Playboy asking them to come on over for a visit and sit out by the pool with Hef. P.S. Come alone.   What if the Swans themselves become enamored with their own Swanicity? They'll spend hours just staring at themselves in the mirror. The daily Swanification rituals will become tedious and eat up a lot of time. They may no longer be interested in domestic affairs. After all, they are a Swan and swans are to be admired. I see big trouble in the old pond. I will always wonder about that one swan that ran away. Once you've been swaned there is no undoing it.   PT is not into  The Swan  at all. He missed all the T&A last night, but I didn't disturb him to let him know what he was missing. My son, KC, kept me on the phone for 2 1/2 hours straight last night. I finally had to tell him that I needed a bathroom break and to eat my nightly fruit allowance. I had to tape  The Swan  and some other show with the sound muted because he happened to call at the same time that they were on. That's what happens when you live in different time zones.    Today is one of those balmy days when thunderstorms roll across the sky leaving you drenched one minute and then heating you up like a hot poker the next. My father was a sky watcher. Anytime a storm would appear, he'd be up pacing the floors and checking things out, then we'd have to load up in the car and go to a storm shelter. I have never seen a tornado on the ground or even been close to one. I feel very protected in my box canyon. I don't think one would dare come in here. Our dog, Candypants, thinks otherwise. He is a mess. If I were to rely on him to be my early warning system, I'd be in a high state of alert all the time. PT thinks he's a candy ass because he's afraid of a lot of things. PT is the one who should be afraid as he hasn't experienced things that make one a candy ass. Candypants and I have a bond so I try to encourage him to ignore what's going on outside and just listen to the music playing loudly in an attempt to settle him down. You know, sort of like what they did on the Titanic to drown out the screams, etc.    I have one other thing that's been eating on me lately. I will watch the very last episode of  The Sopranos  this year, but no more after that. I can only watch Tony cave in somebody's ass, beat them with a belt, or blow their brains out so many times. Supposedly, Tony Soprano has panic disorder. In order to have panic attacks, you have to have a conscience and I don't believe he has one. He's constantly blowing smoke up everyone's ass and manipulating them. Sociopaths are usually involved in his kind of business. I know that his character is supposed to be the kindly mobster with a heart, but I'm not buying it. I do have an answer of sorts. There is adequate proof that panic disorder is cause by a biochemical imbalance just like diabetes and other diseases. That means that Tony could sit there in his therapist's office for the rest of his life and become a very insightful panic attack sufferer or just take the damned medicine and stop wasting his time with her because there is no cure.  Well, that is all the Poo that is fit to print at this time.   Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      IT'S ABOUT TIME I got a little disrespect. I was correct when I said nobody would call me from the courthouse, so I called them myself this afternoon. The City Clerk went to check on my status and she said I was excused. EXCUSED. I've never felt so happy about not being wanted. Personally, even I wouldn't want me sitting in a jury box deciding the fate of somebody. Catnip just doesn't have IT anymore. It's dawning on me how all old people lose their minds a little piece at a time in a process so subtle they don't realize it at the time. One memory function that I still retain is a chronological list of all sins committed by PT since he had the misfortune to run into me and then err further by marrying me. His mistake! KC accuses me of switching lanes while talking and not even giving a signal. Consider my signal to be flashing at this very moment.        I have the most wonderful dictionary ever. You can actually look up fuck, asshole, bitch, son of a bitch, cunt, cocksucker and all the other narsty words in existence. See, that is how I judge the true value of a dictionary. Yesterday, I wanted to share a new word I had found on an online dictionary. It was Fart Art, but PT refused to hear about it. Apparently, he must've figured out what it was because I heard him laughing maniacally while farting his head off in the living room. He yelled at me back here to inform me that he was making fart art. That's my good little man. Proud of him.        I know I did an entire rant about PT eating my last 1/4 cup of Triple Lemon Twist ice cream, but I had an itch that needed scratching right around the midnight hour. PT was already asleep, but I was able to sneak into the laundry room and enter the freezer without him hearing me. I, Catnip, confess that I opened his giant tub of Cherry Nut ice cream and his Chocolate Almond one as well. If you take a small bite of Cherry Nut along with Chocolate Almond then you die on the spot and go straight to heaven. I didn't overdo it because chocolate gives me heartburn. Pure decadence mixed with hyprocrisy. A heady blend. Settle down now, I told PT what I did when he came home for lunch. He threatened to add it to the sin index that he keeps on me which only made me smile. I'm afraid he isn't equipped for that kind of intel retrieval because he doesn't even remember what he just ate for lunch.          I finally went to bed at 1:30 a.m. and read for awhile. For some reason Pooks thinks he's so adorable that he can lay on my right hip like Simba does. Simba weighs 7 pounds and he weighs 20+. I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I let him do it. My mother always says that if we really do reincarnate, she wants to come back as a rich man's poodle. Not me, I want to come back as a cat with an owner just like me. Most people who believe in reincarnation do not believe that they ever come back as animals. Those of the Hindu faith believe in the transmigration of the soul into any waiting vessel which explains, in part, all the sacred cows running loose in the streets. Contrary to what you may think, Catnip has studied all religions for most of her adult life. I am at a stopping place now and have found peace with what I've learned. Don't look around for me in any church because I don't hang out there.        Sig Other sent me a beautiful rosary with cobalt blue glass beads that were  individually wrapped with gold wire. He's Catholic and I am a heathen, but I love religious artifacts. This was during his adventure on the high seas last year. KC was at his breaking point and Sig Other decided to take a leave of absence and do his own rehab free of charge. There was no booze on the ship and supposedly they had no access to any because they were stuck onboard for three months. I know that somebody could've smuggled some in, but I think if he'd gotten his hands on any they would've thrown him overboard. He gets out of hand when he drinks and is unable to work the next day. For some reason, Sig Other is in a mood to buy me some type of jewelry again. No reason. I find this odd because he knows I'm not digging what's going on with their relationship right now. I'm one of those rare types who does not enjoy ass kissers and all the benefits that type of behavior brings. My lip imprints will never be found on anyone's ass. Even when Sig Other knows I'm not pleased, he forgets about it and all is lovely in his world the next day. Mine too, until I get another phone call from KC after he's has gone wild again. P.S. Sig Other has talked to me on the phone in his drunken state and said some things that, quite frankly, I won't be forgetting anytime soon. Being an impartial mother-in-law must be a bitch and a half. I'm sure I will never experience that feeling during this lifetime.      Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN. I just didn't think it would be this quick. As soon as PT saw the nice unthawed freezer, he has been on a mission to cram everything he comes to into it. I was driven to another town today where I was assured that we could buy some of those fabou frozen chinese wontons to go along with our variety of frozen chinese entrees. It took us an hour and a half to get there only to be told that the wonton line had been discontinued. SheeeeIt!!! After that major blow, there were other things that were no longer available either. I was able to find my very special dried mangoes, so it wasn't a total loss. It was so hot that the resident grackles were stepping lightly on the asphalt saying Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! My imaginary grandchild calls them caw caw birds. She will have to remain anonymous because her parents said so. They aren't quite as protective of her as Michael Jackson is with the wearing of the 7 veils and mardi gras masks and such, but I am not to reveal her whereabouts or details of her existence. I hope her wicked parents audit this blog daily and then feel bad for depriving me of reporting our special moments. I guess I should tell you that I did get to see her and her parents today. Had it not been for that and seizing the dried mangoes, I would have felt utterly cheated out of a good day.  I have to be very careful with PT after he pays the bill and then go out to the parking lot to load everything into the pickup. For some unknown reason, he will invariably start an argument. This time it was over a receipt that I had lost just by getting into the truck.  It blew out the window! It was gone forever now and blah, blah, blah.  I thought he probably needed to eat shit and die, but we rode in silence to our favorite restaurant which is halfway between the place I can't talk about and our house. Guess what PT found after we parked the truck? The receipt that I had lost. He should've looked under his own ass first before blaming me. We went in, ordered, and cooled off. There were oldies playing on the radio and Strut by Sheena Easton came on. I looked around and everybody in the place was rocking out in their booths. I could see the waitresses back by the service counter shaking their daisy duke covered asses all around having a good old time. I love Strut as much as the next person and I even have the 45 of it, but I'm not going to do Fantasia's bobo dance in public. It's just funny to see old farts doing the groove thang, that's all. Yes, I am old too. Let's see, factor in the e=mc and take out the speed of light and that would make me #%&! Okay, so I'm older than dinosaur shit and I horde juke box CD's and I play them when I'm all alone. There, I hope you're satisfied now that you've tortured it out of me.  I love talking to waitresses so I asked ours if she was from a certain state and she said she wasn't. I told her that I detected an accent and a phrase  she used that made me think she was. She said that when people come in and they're from other countries or states that she starts talking just like them and it had been very embarrassing for her a few times. One evening, she had a whole table of Irishmen and before the night was over she was speaking in an Irish accent.   They certainly do have very strict rules regarding drinking. If you are already toast when you show up, you will be asked to leave. If you become toast while you are there and cause problems, you will be asked to leave. If you refuse, you will tossed out on your toasted ass and may never set foot in their establishment again. After I read that to PT just in case he ever needed to know, I scanned their drinkee poo list. Here it is:  The Bullfighter The Mule Kick The Naked Sunburn 007 Martini Cinco De Martini VooDoo Martini Down and Dirty Martini The Slow Comfortable Screw Cucumber Martini-guaranteed to make you wanna cuke later on.   I bet they have a little song like this: It makes you wanna cuke, throw your hands up and cuke, throw your head back and cuke, just a little bit louder now, little darlin you make me wanna cuke, yes you do. After that you are never invited back. Nevah. Evah. Nada. No es welcome senor or senorita. Bye Bye Bye. Adios.   Designated Driver Drinks are:  Tropi-Cow Mocha Latte Da The Toothless Grizz  Box-O-Chocolates.  Buffalo Breath Sasparilla Warm and Fuzzy Mocha  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens.

      TODAY IS THE BIG DAY for our neglected upright freezer. Several years have passed since I've had a chance to defrost it and, yes, there is a reason for my slovenly ways. PT keeps it filled to maximum capacity with food from Costco so the timing has always been off. If he sees so much as an eight inch area that's empty, he will buy something on sale to stick in there. The freezer compartment for the frig is the same way, but it's frost free.  I pulled the plug at 8 a.m. and very sweetly asked PT to check on that stopper at the bottom because I wasn't sure if it needed to be taken out. He went to work and I went back to bed because I no longer sleep well due to menopausal night sweats. After the incessant ringing of the phone woke me up, I dragged myself out of bed to check the messages and decided to see how the big thaw was coming along. There was enough ice water on the floor to sink The Titanic's twin sister. PT had been thoughtful enough to lay a towel in the bottom of the freezer and then place a very small shallow cookie sheet to catch all the melted stuff. I grabbed the mop and went to work after I pulled all of the feed sacks away from the ice flow. Thankfully, none of them were soggy on the bottom yet. I grabbed my huge roasting pan and shoved it in place of the cookie sheet. Kismet!  I am ashamed to admit that it is now 3:20 in the afternoon and there is still a sheet of ice present on each of the racks that would rival the landscape of the Artic tundra. At least there are no icebergs present or maybe I just can't see them for all the ice sheets. Mysteriously, the cats are all locked out on the backporch. I'm gonna make a guess here and say that PT caught one or all of them on the freezer shelves with their tongues stuck to the ice and had to rescue them. A cat really needs their tongue, you know. My cat care just doesn't include certain things. I know what they must've been thinking. " Oh, look, someone left the freezer door open, let's go investigate. Hey, Pookie why don't you lick the ice? Heh, heh. "   I am sad to announce that I e-mailed a fellow blogger and congratulated her on her book deal and asked a couple of questions. After a month, she finally responded and was very sweet. I made a huge mistake and decided to look at her blog from the beginning to see how she started out and now, I wish I hadn't. She maintains that people who are 50 something(her mother's age)were cut out with the same cookie cutter. They are all generic people who dress and behave in a certain way. Catnip is old if you go by her age, but in her heart she is not much over 21. I don't hang around with people I find boring, but there are boring people in all age groups. She added more salt to the wound when she complained about getting  lots of e-mails  from retarded people asking her about her book deal. Well, I guess this OLD retarded dinosaur will just have to save her old filthy money and buy somebody else's book who isn't quite so smug. Good Day Missy!   Copyright© 2004.

      My maternal great-greatfather described me as a ring-tailed tooter which is a person who will do anything they think of and is very talented. It also refers to a wildly energetic person or one who routinely excels at things. Since I was only 3 or 4  when he saw me, I'm pretty sure he meant it as a compliment. That whole side of the family adored children and even adopted more when they already had their own large brood to care for. Their children had extremely large families, but that is where it all stopped. My mother and her siblings limited themselves to 1-3 children and that was it. I was not able to spend a lot of time amongst my relatives because of my father's job which kept us moving one or twice a year during the entire time I lived at home.  I don't have long-term relationships due to the fact that I got used to being alone most of the time during my youth and I am now a certified loner. It's not that I don't care for other people or that I don't want them in my life. It's just that it feels odd and I can never totally be myself unless I am alone.    I do, however, allow myself to love my parents, my own family, my pets, and apparently inanimate objects. It has come to my attention, of late, that I am having an affair with my computer. We've been together for ten years. Although, I have never given him a name, maybe I should. After all, we spend practically all my waking hours together. He's the first thing I want to see in the morning and I'm extremely reluctant to part with him before I force myself to go to bed without him. We eat together, laugh and cry together, and even watch television together, but we do not go out in public together. People would take one look at us and sense exactly what was going on. He knows everything about me including all my secrets which he keeps hidden for me in my 432 very important folders loaded with vital crapareeno. He loves to read and travel so we cavort all over the world via his mighty navigating tool; checking out exotic places and anything that looks even slightly eccentric. He's an investigator just like his secret lover.    I treat him with devotion and loving care. If I even think he might be coming down with a virus, it's off to the computer doctor. He never complains even when I stick my  little stuffed bunny, Lucky Lester, on top of his monitor head. Every now and then, I brush the cookie crumbs from his keyboard lips and then dust under his keyboard chin. Cookie crumbs enjoy hiding there, too, for some reason. He is coated in the same thick layer of caliche dirt and fuzzy hairs from the cats who roost on each of the arms of my big stuffed chair. A third cat assumes the crown position on the back of the chair as well, just so he can chew on my hair. My lover sits with me near a window so we can look out and see what is going on outside and then gossip about our neighbors. I know they gossip about us too. Unfortunately, everyone feels free to divulge all their secrets to me. I don't really care for that type of thing so although I may hear a lot, I don't pass it on. It stops right here with me and what's his name.    He always listens and we solve life's little problems together. For the past two days, he and I have been pouring over every bit of data we could lay our mouse on. We were finally able to grasp the HTML codes and now we both feel competent. He even helped me pick out our blog templates. He really has an eye for color and fonts. I think the secret to our relationship is that we really, really need each other. Who else could you turn to if you absolutely needed to know the breeding habits of the koala bear or find out if you really do have advanced adrenal hyperplasia? No one would know, but he can always find an answer for me. I did tell him that I bought a book about writing and that we have some exciting things to work on next year. I could tell he was thrilled because I heard a little squeal come from the modem tower. Our love will remain purely platonic unless they design a vibrating mouse. Who knows, maybe they already have and me and my compulover need to go shopping. Google, here we come.  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      YOU KNOW THAT REALLY excellent oolong tea they serve in oriental restaurants? Earl Grey now has a decaf green tea. I can't have caffeine and although I like all the other teas they make, this tea is a funky yellowish-green colored liquid with little or no taste. It's not even close to the real green tea back in the day when I could drink whatever I wanted. PT bought some for himself that was packing caffeine and he has the same complaint. Finally, something we can agree on. Rare, very rare.  I have a beauty secret for women of a certain age. Do you still have your old Epilady stuffed underneath the bathroom sink like I do? Well, this tip is for you. First, I pull all my hair away from my face and secure it tightly with a rubber band, then I use the Epilady like a razor on my face. Honeychile, it is better than anything else I've found. Those fine hairs can't escape Epilady and it doesn't hurt as much as it does on your legs.   I have just returned from my attempt to have an on the surface clean house. This involves cat box detail, dishwasher loading and unloading, laundry, sweeping, and lastly picking up the gremlins that Candypants scratches off. I grab my giant, fuschia colored, ceiling fan bristle brush and walk around like a city park gardner gathering litter with a sharp pole. I grab the hair off as I go and follow the trail which leads me straight to Candypants. As soon as he sees me, he flees as though he has just gotten a call on his cell phone and is urgently needed someplace. I finish and then follow a different trail which leads me directly to his new hiding place. I finally put the fucking stuff away and will wait for a time when he is not lounging around inside enjoying the air-conditioning.     Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens.

      MY SON, KC, HAS A resume longer than the trail to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. He had three jobs at one time, one of which was flower delivery guy for a flower shop owned and operated by a German family. They've treated my son like family and gone to great lengths to help him in every possible way. I'm not even in the same time zone, much less close enough to offer him immediate aid when he needs it, but they are and they do.     KC takes me with him via his cell phone when he's shopping, going anywhere in the car, or doing just about anything. He also zips around town delivering flowers in the flower shop van while talking to me on the phone. I always shut up during actual deliveries. As I listened quietly one morning, I heard the following:  KC:   "Good morning ladies. How's it going?"  Ho:  "Hey, young man, are those for me?    KC:  "Well, if your name is Princess, they are."  Ho:  "Figures, she gets all the good stuff!"  KC:   "Do you know where Princess is?"  Ho:  "Yes, go around to the side door and take the flowers to the desk. Sylvia will see that she gets them. If you enter by the front door, the girls will all line up waiting for you to pick one of them."  As he was heading back to the van, I asked him where in the hell we'd been. Apparently, he'd made a delivery to a brothel. It's totally legal. I quizzed him about the flowers, who they were for, who sent them, and why. If you're a woman, you aren't going to like the answer.  That's right ladies, the hookers are getting flowers in addition to being paid for taking men around the world in 80 ways! These are not the inexpensive simple carnation bouquets or the single rosebud in a vase variety. Oh no, only the finest and most expensive array of flowers are good enough for them, namely, The Bird Of Paradise arrangement. The madam also gets her own personal vase of floral fru fru. I did the math and I figure I am owed several dump truck loads of petunias.   May the Bird of Paradise fly up their noses and right back out their asses.   Copyright© 2004.

      WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM at our house. It's PT and his hearing or lack thereof. He refuses to go to an audiologist to get his hearing checked or even consider getting a hearing aid. It seems just like yesterday when the kids and I would help him with building projects. We'd put in earplugs whenever he turned on the big saws and I believe the exact words he used were as follows. "Y'all are just a bunch of dang pussies with your sensitive ears." Guess who still has their hearing? The pussies that's who. I always end up having to repeat what I say to him about three times and then by the fourth time, I'm standing in front of him, doing sign language while talking slowly in a very loud voice which scares the dog. You know what? I think his dog is a pussy. That's right! A big ole P-U-S-S-Y or Woofersnatchhole, if you please.    Unfortunately, PT's dog is under the impression that our casa is his own personal big dog house with air conditioning. As fate has decreed it, Canydpants is as nervous as a whore in church and if he hears a rumble of thunder, a backfire, a gunshot, or one firecracker go off, he is on the porch tearing the door down trying to get inside. The other day a violent storm blew through our area, so I had to put a rolling office chair inside a closet, turn the battery operated radio on full blast, and sit there for two hours. I had all my emergency items right at my fingertips should I get blown away like the wicked witch that I am. Just as I got settled in and opened the book I planned to read, the thunder amped up to the max. I looked up and there was Candypants standing over me hyperventilating with his hot sweaty dog breath in my already cramped space. He only loves me when it's raining. Tra La La La...Lucky Me!  Ordinarily, I try to weeniefy Candypants when I know a storm is brewing. I get a package of cheap weiners and, with my veterinarian's blessing, I drill a small hole in one end of the weiner with a straw and then drop two people antihistamine tabs into the hole. After that, I seal the hole with the weiner guts that are left in the straw. It's all very scientific. Candypants gobbles it up and everybody is happy. Sort of. I get to feeling guilty because then his mouth dries up and he's all leaned up against me smacking his lips because he has no slobber left. He will not lay down and feels that he must have his giant head in my lap, so that I can pet him continuously until the boom boom is all gone. We had sheet lightening and those thunderboomers that shake the ground beneath your feet so all in all the day was a total loss.   Please  do not  weeniefy your dog without first checking with your vet because the dose is based on their weight, age, etc. and you might end up killing your dog accidentally and then it would be all my fault. Oh, I can't live with that kind of pressure. Now where did I put those weiners? Maybe, I should weigh myself first. Woof! Woof!  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      I'VE BEEN GIVING the idea of cloning myself a lot of thought and I think I could manage my life a lot better if I had one or two clones at my beck and call. Ah, my sweets, the things I could get done.   1. Breakfast, lunch and dinner would be left up to My Clones. They would make all decisions as to choice of meals, the preparation, serving, and best of all the clean up.  2. My Clones would have laundry detail including sorting, stain removal, checking pockets for screwdrivers, money, etc., starting the washing machine, loading things into dryer, placing items onto color coded hangers and seeing to it that they got to the appropriate closets and drawers.   3. Personal grooming would be their job. They would draw my bath, scrub my skin with exfoliants, wash my hair, plaster my skin with soothing oils and lotions. I would step out of the tub into a large warm towel and then sit on a stool while my hair was dried and styled for the day. I would no longer have to stress out over what to wear because my wardrobe would already be coordinated and I would be dressed according to my mood and weather conditions. Certain days would be set aside for hair coloring and nail care.   4. Any problems of a personal nature would be dealt with by My Clones. I would sit in the comfort of my own home while they went forth and slayed my dragons for me. I would no longer be left to haggle with our mail-in prescription service or take care of all the problems that are actually my man's responsibility. My Clones would answer all phone calls and alert me when there was someone I actually wanted to talk to.   5. Guess what? My Clones are in for a whole lot of vacuuming, dusting, and mopping each and every day. Yay!!!!   6. My Clones will sit by my bed at night reading to me from a novel of my choice until I fall asleep. They will then slip in a bookmark, put it on my nightstand, and turn off the light. That's right, I am going to become totally worthless.    7. When my man is in a piss poor mood, I will send in one of My Clones to deal with him. If he wants me to go somewhere in the truck while he's is in a shitty mood, then they can toss a coin to see who has to go. I, meanwhile, will be here at home enjoying myself without all the drama trauma.   8. When one of my children calls and they are upset, My Clone will talk to them and say just the right thing until they are feeling better. I will then take the phone and visit with them without feeling awful and wishing I could help them.   9. My Clones must definately be into pet care, cat box hygiene, filling water pans, daily feeding, grooming all pets, nail trimming, ear washing, bathing Candypants, and dispensing medications when needed. Candypants requires a great deal of attention and My Clones must always be available to let him in and out at least fifty times a day.  10. My Clones would be in charge of looking up words in a real dictionary and giving me the meaning or spelling as my spellchecker checked out several years ago; the one on my hard-drive and the one in my brain as well.  11. My Clones will need to keep a group of indoor house plants alive and well while maintaining my small collection of outdoor rose bushes and other plants. A definate plus would be the ability to keep a weeping willow tree alive which is something I have yet to master.  12. While I am engaging in this delusional fantasy, I would like My Clones to be imbued with the special ability  to have surgery that would affect all of us as if we'd had the same surgery and enjoy the results. They will also be in charge of filling my pill box and dispensing meds at the correct time during the day.     13. I've already asked for a whole lot, but there's one more thing I want. My Clones need to be proficient in accupressure massage and foot reflexology. Each night they will have to fix my aching back, ass, and feet. From doing what, you ask? Years of abusing my body unintentionally to be specific.  I'm sure you're wondering what in the hell I'll be doing while I am living the life of a pampered princess. Well, plenty. I have so many things I'm interested in and can't get to because of all the above. Plus, I could just sit around all day and look pretty. I know all that TLC would go a long way towards taming my inner Bitch and that be worth a lot.  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      I AM SICK OF BEING SICK, so yesterday I flipped through every channel on our digital satellite system until I found something that was "interesting" enough to take what was left of my mind off of my sniffle, cough, cough, wet my pants bodily symptoms. Can't really say what I watched, but I believe it was on VH1, MTV or something like that and it mainly featured 80's hair bands. One groupie was brilliant enough to take  the penile statistics on several well-known and lesser-known rock stars and catalogue them. It was suggested that we log onto a certain site www.metalsludge.com to check out the wangometer results. It took me an hour to finally gain access to the site itself and another twenty minutes to figure out where the dick stats were kept. Finally, I found them under Donna's Domain. Damn! The list was not totally comprehensive by any means, but there were plenty of names that I recognized which was enough to keep me busily researching for a couple of more hours. After that, I read some of Donna's e-mails which contained some tidbits in them as well.  I'm wondering how their "roving reporters" managed to obtain such accurate results as to the length and girth of all the various penis entries. I know that some guys don't mind a gal whipping out a tape measure and taking a measurement, but usually that's only if they have one worth measuring. I did find out something quite stunning. No, it wasn't Tommy Lee's data, but it is connected to him via one Heather Locklear. Isn't there some unwritten rule that a girl can have exclusive access to a giant penis only once in her life? I never thought Heather would fall face forward into the Giant Dick pile a second time, but she managed to score a second gargantuan one when she married Richie Sambora. It appears that the man can carry on for hours, take a little 15 minute nap, wake up, and do it all over again. After reading that, I just had to do more research regarding how some of the rockers treated their groupie after they were done with them for the night. I really expected to read that they got knocked off the saddle, thrown to the floor, and then were asked to leave immediately. Not so. Of course, there were several selfish "I got mine" types, those who only stood at half-mast, the ones who were too drunk, and those who were less than springtime fresh in the hygiene department.  All I seem to remember for sure is who the slackers are, who swings both ways, and that No Doubt's bass player Tony Kanal places somewhere near the top with a ten incher. There were also thinly veiled hints that Kip Winger of the rock group Winger is reportedly running loose in the wild with a biggun. Nobody has been able to tranquilize him, take his measurements, and tag him so they can add his data into their files yet. One can only hope that there will be a sighting because Catnip thought he was very hot even before she heard about this rumor. In case anybody should ever read this, Catnip has seen some penises in her life and even if someone has the biggest one in captivity, you'll still need something to go along with it or else thing's just get boring and pathetic after awhile. By all means, do try at least one before you die. Donna's Domain gives you helpful hints on how to do all the math in your head and pick one from the herd before you take a ride. Happy Trails to you.   Copyright© 2004 Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      I KNOW EVERYBODY is out partying, eating B-B-Q,  guzzling low carb beer, and shooting off fireworks, but Catnip is all alone here at the house feeling just like an old petrified Trilobite turd. I don't want to sound bitter or nuthin, but if I hear somebody laugh or even act like they're having fun, I intend to hunt them down and piss on their puddin pop until they start crying and/or call the police.   Anyways, me and my man have come down with some kind of bio-engineered upper respiratory tract goings on. So far, he's been to the emergency room three times with nose bleeds he can't get stopped. Finally, that E.R. doctor rammed a little bitty tampex with a string up his left nostril and put a stop to all that nonsense. He got it taken out yesterday, so he could go on back to work. Yipee!  I'm in the last stages of this germfest. About all the enthusiasm I'd been able to work up was spent watching a serial killer movie starring Judd Nelson. Could they have made him look any creepier? His hairstyle alone screams, "I'm seriously deranged. Look out!" I think the female target, the new widow, made a lot of amateur mistakes. Here's my advice to her.   1. When your brand spankin new husband gets snuffed on vacation in his hometown, don't hang doing a full-scale investigation on your own. Go Home! 2. If the Sheriff says he doesn't want to be bothered with your suspicions, don't show up at his door late at night to discuss your latest theory. He was busy getting crunked and you ruined it. You're totally fucked after that. 3. If some creeped out dude starts hanging around hugging you and kissing your cheek everytime you turn around, then you need to red flag his ass. P.S. Don't share all your Private Eye details with him either cause it's HIM!  4. Okay, here's the most important part. If somebody just offed your husband, you might want to keep all the relatives at the house with you instead of ushering them out the door and sending them home on the first plane out. Major Mistake!   5. When you finally figure it all out for real and decide to play games, save yourself some time. Don't flirt with the serial killer, french kiss him, or pretend you're gonna run off with him to Loveland. After you send him home to pack up his panties while you sneak out the back door to get into your ride, don't act all surprised when you find out he's been hiding in the bushes the whole time. You've been caught lying and being sneaky. Serial killers have a high moral standards when it comes to things like that. Pisses em off.   6. Get a fucking cell phone. Your friend has been trying to call your sorry ass and warn you about this wingnut for over 4 hours while he drives 100 mph to come to your aid. Also, when the perverino cuts your phone lines, it won't make a shit cause you got your cell for backup.  7. After he captures you and you're sitting in a rowboat in the middle of a lake with your hands bound behind your back, shut the fuck up. Sure, he's been rowing around in circles for hours, but let him knock himself out and burn off some of that serial killer rage. There's always the possibility that he'll keel over from exhaustion which will buy you more time. You just had to start running your mouth which made him stop rowing and broke his concentration.     Well, I won't tell you the ending in case you ever come down with a bio-engineered summer flu/cold and are coughing up green sputum on the Fourth of July and have nothing to do except watch Trilobite Turds on The Discovery Channel and shit like Judd Nelson serial killer movies.    I gotta go let Candypants, our 125 pound dawg, in. He gets awful nervous with all the fireworks going off outside. He's real gun shy too. To be honest, the sound of his own farts makes him nervous. Makes him jump up and run all over the damned house trying to get away from the noise which only makes him fart more.   Copyright© 2004 Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      SIMPLE DIMPLE RULES   Pretending that you didn't hear the cat puking during the night and then giving the evidence wide berth the next morning so that you won't have to clean it up, is not fair.  When your wife announces that she is going on a diet, do not run to the nearest store and buy up all her favorite cookies, candy, chips, cheese in a spray can, and other assorted temptations to leave on her desk just in case.  In keeping with Diet Protocol, please do not eat up all the special diet foods your wife bought for herself, so that you and the rest of the family could eat your regular foods and not have to suffer along with her.   If your wife buys a sporty little used Mustang convertible and specifically states that you are not to put the top down, then please do not watch anxiously as she pulls out of the drive on her way to work so, at long last, you can finally put that top down and play VROOM VROOM in the garage all day. Explaining why the top is down and why it will no longer go back up when she returns will be muy dificil mi amigo.   There is no designated shit shoveler. If a pet belongs to both of you, then both parties are responsible for the shit recovery safari. No questions asked. It's only fair.  When your wife wants to make a thirty dollar purchase and you say no because you have loaned $127.00 to a co-worker last December and it is now May, please figure out how you are going to survive the conflagration that follows. The co-worker does not sleep in your bed or pay your bills. In fact, they haven't even paid back the $127.00 that started this whole mess all up in here. You're such an asshole! Sorry, I forgot where I was for a moment.   If your wife expresses their displeasure when you appear in a sweaty, oil-stained coverall ensemble, please do not push your luck by insisting on wearing it out in public even if it is only a trip to Walmart. It simply isn't done in finer circles.  Unless you are thoroughly scrubbed, anointed with scented oils, have brushed your teeth, flossed, scraped your tongue, applied deodorant, used mouthwash, cleaned your ears out, removed all lint from your belly-button, cleaned under your fingernails, and clipped your toenails, you will not be treated fairly during the negotiation for any possible sexual activity. It's only fair.  Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

      I'M BORED WITH THE BAN ON TALKING, so I took a test to see what kind of dog I am most compatible with and how this translates into a man I'd be interested in. Okay, but I've already said that I like my pets better than most people. Couldn't they have gone with cats instead of dogs? I'm not sure which answers lead to these choices, but here are my results. The following breeds are your best matches. A mixed-breed combination of any of the two of these breeds will work as well.  Best Match  Beagle   (11.38) - He's the kind who runs naked though the gym during the high school pep rally. I got the kids a beagle when the oldest was about 7 and he lasted for years. They are darling, but I can't date anyone who runs around naked. NO!   Springer Spaniel   (10.39) - The Springer man follows his bliss and is "Mr. Intense" in the workplace. Catnip doesn't think she could get along with this dog or the man. NO!   Vizsla   (9.35) - He'll keep his body and his sex drive well into his senior years and will hate it if his partner doesn't. Okay, this is more like it and funny that they should pick this dog. I've only seen one in my entire life. I was absolutely fascinated with the dog and wanted to buy him. The owner wouldn't hear of it, so PT finally pulled me off of the dog and insisted that I leave. You know what I really liked was his unique nose leather which was a color that co-ordinated with his eyelids/eyelashes and fur color. They warned me to stay away from Rhodesian Ridgebacks. We had one we thought was a stray, but it turned out that he just liked us better than his current owner who wasn't taking care of him. After the Ridgeback pissed on the Schwan guy's shoes when Candypants intimidated him during a meet and greet, we decided to do the dog a favor and take him to the Humane Society where I " know " people. His former owner just happened to be there that day, so it worked out well for everyone. I am proud to announce that I can now post a pic to my blog thanks to Flickr which I found in the Blogger information section. I've done the Bloggerbot/Piccaso thing with no luck. Maybe, I'm the only lame person on Blogger, but I still don't have the first clue. Paint Shop Pro basics and the scanner are about all I've been able to master. My copy of  PSP For Dummies  and  Idiots   Guide For PSP  weren't helpful and I remain as ignorant today as I was the day I bought them. Give Flickr a try if you have as much trouble as I do with technical stuff. It is so easy.  Copyright© 2004 by Catnip Clemens. Minnow Paws. All rights reserved.

      Once upon a midnight bleary, while I pondered, weak and weary Over many a curious volume of Harry Potter lore- While I drowsed, nearly sleeping, suddenly there came a crapping As of something gently crapping, crapping by my bedroom door "Tis some visitor," I muttered, "crapping by my bedroom door- Only this and nothing more." Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the heat of July; And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the B-B-Q grille. So that now, to still the pounding of my heart, I stood repeating, "Tis only some stranger entreating entrance at my bedroom door- This it is and nothing more." Quoth the Catnipper, Presently my heart grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, "Hey You," said I, " truly your forgiveness I implore; But the fact is I was sleeping, and so gently you came crapping, And so faintly you came crapping, crapping at my bedroom door, Though I was very sure I heard You"- I opened wide the door;- Darkness was there and nothing more." Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no clue, And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Pookie?" This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Pookie!" Merely this and nothing more. Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;- 'Tis the wind and nothing more!" Over here I flung the bedcovers, when, with many a flip and flutter, In there stepped a stately feline of the saintly days of yore; Then this white feline beguiling my mad face into smiling, By the guilty decorum of the countenance it wore, "Though thy be shorn and shaven ," I said," Thou art sure no fool, Quoth the Catnipper, "Nevermore." Much I marvelled the ungainly Pookie to hear discourse so plainly, Though his answer little meaning-little relevancy bore; Pookie, sat on the dresser, lonely in the placid dust, Caught by his unhappy mistress whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and faster till his purrs burdened her; Then, she thought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen swishing tail, Swung by Pookie whose foot-falls padded on the fuzzy carpet. Forsooth and forever, please stop crap, crap, crapping on my floor, Quoth the Catnipper, "Nevermore."  Ever since I had to change bedrooms due to my recent health problems, Pooks has shown his contempt and displeasure by leaving a big steaming pile right in the doorway to the bedroom every night. He does have his fur shorn for the summer and as a male, it's to be expected that he would choose a symbolic way to announce his unhappiness. My female felines prefer yakking up on clean things to inform me of their disdain.  Hang on ticks and fleas, we are changing lanes. I was not prepared to see that Rick "Superfreak" James had died. How ironic that Dave Chappelle did a parody on him that featured Rick in cameos throughout. One of life's synchronicities.  >^..^   Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens.

      IS NOTHING SACRED ANYMORE? After I got up this morning, I ran back to my bathroom, grabbed my daily medication box, and found it covered in ants!!! They crawled onto my forearm, so I grabbed the Q-tips they'd all partied in the other day and Kevorked their asses with them. You cannot drown them. I've tried. You must take the Q-tip and squash them until they draw up into the fetal position and then you may wash then down the drain. I merely assisted in leading them to the light and the Other Side. I once worked with a Church Lady who insisted that animals have no soul. Says so in the bible, you know. Yep, Catnip knows what all it says in there alright and what it doesn't say because it got left out in the final draft. Church Lady got a call from one of her children saying that the familly dog got creamed on the street in front of their house so she tore out of there to go home and take care of things. I thought she would probably comfort the children and at the very least have a tasteful funeral service. Nope, she was back in thirty minutes. Catnip is so naive. She asked Church Lady what she did with the dog and Church Lady said she put IT in the dumpster. I was stunned so I asked what she told the kids and she said they didn't need to know what she did with IT because IT was none of their business. I'm going to guess that this woman has never had a tight relationship with a pet. In my later years, I've started liking animals more than I do most human beings I run into. Pets will alert you to all kinds of things if you pay attention to them. Newfoundland dogs jump into icy waters just to drag a victim to safety. Working dogs check for bombs, search for victims and criminals, sniff out drugs and bodies of the deceased, wake you up when the house is on fire, and millions of other things. All creatures have emotions, a sense of protection towards their owners, and they definately communicate amongst themselves and with their owners on a subconscious level sort of like sign language. I am the one they come to if they want something specific because they know I'll understand and take care of it. If they want to run wild in the country, then PT is their go to person. Catnip is an indoor type person. Not that you asked, but metaphysically speaking animals do have a group soul and from NDE reports, etc. they are residing in the heavenworld alongside human souls. I certainly hope so because I miss all of mine who have passed out of this life over the years. Before I move on, I just wanted to say that Church Lady was busily making plans to get another dog before the day was over. I asked that she name IT either Dead Dog Walking or Willie Make It. Hiss. Hiss. PT and I came down with the flu in late June. His flu included a nosebleed that went on for three days before it finally stopped. Three emergency room visits later, we owed $1,000.00. Insurance took care of most of it, but we found this amount to be excessive. My flu featured laryngitis, gastrointestinal problems, and just when I thought it was going away; it started back with laryngitis and coughing up blood tinged phlegm which is not what I call a soothing experience upon awakening. The first time it happened, I figured I had tuberculosis or something equally exotic and would be hospitalized immediately. It went away for a little while and now it's back, so I googed it. Seems that if you have been ill with laryngitis it will escalate into something bigger if you use mouthwash, sing, talk a lot, go outside amongst the pollen, and don't use a cold mist humidifier. Guilty as charged. I'd already made all the necessary changes except for the mouthwash, singing, and talking. Sheesh. I may as well join an ashram. I'd fit right in. They don't get to do jack. Shame on you for thinking that vulgar thought about jack.  >^..^     Copyright© 2004 by Catnip Clemens. Minnow Paws. All rights reserved.

      WENT TO THE LIBRARY looking for nothing in particular which meant I was on cruise control and would be drawn to the books I needed to read. I was pulled to find one of the  Sylvia Browne  books I haven't read and found " After Life " by John Edward instead. I checked it out along with " The Republican Noise Machine " by David Brock, " House of Bush House of Saud " by Craig Unger, and " The President of Good & Evil " by Peter Singer. John Edwards, is also the name of Kerry's running mate.  John Edward , the psychic, uses his middle name Edward instead of his real last name. I don't watch him daily, but I do like him and the work he's doing. I am thankful that these two showed up during my lifetime to help make my odd life experiences acceptable and understandable to me. I learned how to handle myself due to their influence. Nobody else has to like it or approve of me because I was born with certain skills. Pt dislikes it a lot. I don't advertise my abilities because I lost a good friend that way. Four years ago, my friend, Patricia, and another woman named Cindy wanted me to come over and see if we could have a " seance ,"  their  word, not mine. They had all the traditional stuff out on the table like candles, pictures of Jesus, and the Lord's Prayer. I do know that there were no overhead fans or drafts in that room. After things got underway, I was busy saying what I was picking up and the candles started flickering and then the flames all bent over in the same direction and stayed that way. I didn't see it happen because I had my head down trying to take notes while speaking. If I don't write it down, then sometimes the information gets lost and I can't get it back. Patricia swore that she wouldn't freak out if anything unusual happened, but she did. Before it was all over, there were thumping noises coming from the attic and uncomfortable feelings from the other ladies. The other woman, Cindy, accused Patricia of telling me some of the information I came up with. She vehemently denied this and there was no way she could have known anything to tell me about in the first place. I charged no fee and I certainly didn't need or want recognition for what I do. Patricia and I left after that and the very last time I talked to her, she said that Cindy called the priest after we left and had him come over to bless the house and exorcise the spirit or whatever was in the attic. I don't carry ghosts with me, but the person who came through was a suicide and that was the source of the thumping. Patricia wanted to contact her deceased mother which I was unable to do with all the flack coming from Cindy. Patricia admitted that she was a little skittish about it all and that she never thought she would ever see anything like it. I can understand her fright because I used to be afraid, too, until I learned to control things. That was my last outing of that nature other than when KC calls because someone he knows is in trouble. All he is allowed to give me is their name and birthdata. We do not talk about them before or after the reading. If he tells me anything about them, then I cannot do a reading. I type up all my impressions and mail them the information. If they had questions they were allowed to call me and ask whatever they wanted. I haven't done any readings for about two years. I keep my impressions in a file to see if what I receive is indeed reliable. No day is 100% and my best impressions always come  out of the blue . I'll never be as good as the famous psychics, but I'm not looking for that type of notoriety. What I really want to do is to write and if I have to be known for anything, it would in that field. I keep pushing myself via this blog to post something everyday just to get into the habit of writing. My dream life is so active that it seems like I never get any rest, but a lot of my ideas for articles and short stories come from my dreams. Sleeping is wonderful because it's the only time I am so free, relaxed, and unrestricted. I've always dreamed in color and I keep a dream diary. It took me ten years to learn how to interprete them. A lot of times I get the meaning if I read them to someone. I have no idea why that works, but it does. My mother, myself, KC, and my daughter Zoey have the "gift", but none of us really want it and we just put up with it and use it for positive reasons in our own lives. My maternal grandmother had a boarder at one time that did Tarot card readings in the 1930's. That was quite a shockeroo for me, but I loved finally hearing about it. Makes me wonder if grandmother wasn't gifted too. I was roaming around yesterday looking at some blogs and ran across one slamming Sylvia Browne, John Edwards, and other significant psychics. I did not leave a comment or e-mail him a flaming screamer. Instead, I looked at the site where he learned all that he knows about psychics in general. I have already said that no psychic is 100% right all the time. The blogger in question also picked out some psychic predictions that didn't come about. There is a reason for this, but I don't feel that I could explain it to those who haven't had psychic experiences or at least experienced a reading by someone who isn't a fraud. I've run across some of those myself, but no money passed hands so it didn't matter to me if they were full of crap. There are certain people who claim that what John Edwards does is a total fraud and that he does cold readings. I'd really like for you to look at  urlLink " this "  site and after you read the article, please scan the comments of those who have really been helped.The problem with this type of information is that people simply accept it at face value. After reading the instructions for a cold reading, I would love to hear from anyone  without psychic abilities  who is able to achieve a valid reading on a totally random stranger with no information given other than their name and/or birthdate, and no questioning allowed for clues. Many psychics do readings over the phone, through the mail, and never come into physical contact with their clients so they are picking up nothing in the manner described in the article. I make prayer beads that are similar to rosary beads, but they are for people all faiths. PT and I used to go to a giant flea market and I would buy all the junk jewelry I could find to strip them of their beads or whatever they had on them that I wanted. I, now, have tons of beautiful beads of all colors. I found some beautiful Native American Prayers and I usually say them and some other favorites of mine. These prayers are nothing that you'd ever hear in a church, but they're very comforting. It puts me in touch with the Divine Creator. I'm glad I continued my spiritual quest and found something more in line with my spiritual beliefs. Here is a North American Indian Ute prayer that I enjoy.  EARTH TEACH ME TO REMEMBER By John Yellow Lark  Earth teach me stillness as the grasses are stilled with light. Earth teach me suffering as old stones suffer with memory. Earth teach me humility as blossoms are humble with beginning. Earth teach me caring as the mother who secures her young. Earth teach me courage as the tree which stands alone. Earth teach me limitation as the ant which crawls on the ground. Earth teach me freedom as the eagle which soars in the sky. Earth teach me resignation as the leaves which die in the fall. Earth teach me regeneration as the seed which rises in the spring. Earth teach me to forget myself as melted snow forgets it's life. Earth teach me to remember kindness as dry fields weep in the rain.  I never intended to write on this subject today, but I'm in the mood to share more than I probably should. I usually live to regret it, however, this is my blog and I plan to try to keep things as diverse as possible. I know that some bloggers receive e-mails and/or comments attacking them for their views or something they wrote. If I find a blog I don't care for, I simply click away from it. There are so many blogs out there and there's something for everyone, so why take the time to ream out some blogger? I think Google did a good thing when they moved the list of updated blogs where you can't see them unless you really want to. In the beginning, I felt totally overwhelmed by the sheer volume of blogs out there and knew there were even more than I what I was seeing. The secret seems to be keeping your blog updated no matter what and at the end of five years tops, you will either have a following and maybe something more substantial or you won't. A real crap shoot. It's going to take time and frankly, I'd feel weird if I thought anyone was actually reading any of my posts. Maybe, it's a form of stage fright.  >^..^     Copyright© 2004 by Catnip Clemens. Minnow Paws. All rights reserved.

      I HAVE A FEW simple needs that must be met in order for me to be happy. The first thing I want to see in the morning is  Live With Regis and Kelly  without late breaking news interruptions and before I go to bed I want to see  The Daily Show  with Jon Stewart. These two things are crucial to my well-being. Anything else I may stumble on during the day is gravy. I have no intention of being driven nuts by the 2004 election rabble or governmental rumblings about vague threats to our national security. Honestly, I don't think anybody can wipe out terrorism and it will always be with us. I lived in Oklahoma when homegrown terrorist, Timothy McVeigh, took out the federal building in Oklahoma City. I made up my mind who I was going to vote for in 2004 after I woke up to the presidential debacle in November of 2000 and all that has followed in it's wake. America is extremely lucky not to have been touched by foreign attacks for this long. Terrorism is daily fare in other countries and the people have to learn how to live their lives around it. I get all of my news from internet sources so I can get the whole story and not just what the sheeples from the major television networks think I need to know. If you look, you can find out a great deal about what goes on behind the scenes in American politics. American broadcasters and some citizens no longer have the right to free speech without paying a huge price. The latest outbreak of this type of behavior is reminiscent of events that happened in the 50's and 70's which I don't care to witness. KC called late last night to discuss politics as usual. At least, he and I are on the same team. My parents and I have extreme differences of opinion and my favorite comment to them is that at least I had enough sense not to vote for Nixon. They've had to accept that I am never going to switch my Democratic status. Case closed. I was living in California during the 80's and I didn't vote in 1980 or 1984 because I was not impressed with the Democratic candidate and I never vote for Republicans. The late Ronald Reagan won both races easily. In fact, Reagan lost in Minnesota, but won the other 49 states. Nixon was the only other President to hold that honor and he lost only Massachusetts in 1972. KC said that no War President has ever been re-elected but actually they have. War presidents Lincoln, FDR, James Madison, William McKinley,and oddly enough Richard Nixon all won second terms. "Tricky Dick" Nixon promised the American people that he would bring an end to the Vietnam War and remove our troops and people bought it. That move didn't save his ass from being invited to leave the White House in disgrace during his second term. The Korean War belonged to Truman and Viet Nam was viewed as Johnson's war. Both men were extremely disliked and neither sought re-election. A wise choice on their part. Our most recent wars have been the Viet Nam War, American involvement in Panama in 1989, and the Gulf War of 1991. Johnson increased the number of our troops in Viet Nam and subsequently his popularity rating was so low that he declined to run for re-election. I approved of and liked the way that George HW Bush, Dubya's father, handled the Gulf War when he sent our troops to Iraq in 1990. He had served in the armed service himself and he made a promise that our troops would to be there for a certain amount of time and no longer. He would bring them home quickly and by a certain date. He did what he said he would and I felt very comfortable with him, however, he lost his bid for re-election less than 1 1/2 years later eventhough he had a high popularity rating. I'm going to be perfectly honest and say that I would have voted for Bush the Senior if he had campaigned. All that I remember him saying was that we had won the war in Iraq which certainly wasn't true then or now. He, also, mentioned tearing down the Berlin War. He was there for 8 years as Ronald Reagan's VP and for 4 years as President. Had he shared more information regarding what he had achieved during his time in the White House, I would have voted Republican for the first time in my life. As things stand now, I am going to vote for Kerry/Edwards and if things happen the way they did in the 2000 election, then I'm going to become a member of the Apathetic Party. They never vote and neither will I. I want to see a clear winner on November 3, 2004 with no funny business, no supreme court, and no screw ups in Florida. How convenient that Florida is going to be using computers which will put elders at a disadvantage. My parents think a caller ID and/or an answering machine are too high tech for them. A computer would be beyond the pale for them to deal with. In closing, I did not appreciate the witch hunt that went on the whole time President Clinton was trying to serve America. I, now, have a lot more information about just how that all came about and who was behind it. I've never seen such vile behavior simply because there was a Democrat in the White House and certain people couldn't accept the fact that the Republicans were ousted. I respect Bill and Hillary Clinton precisely because they weathered every storm that came their way and Hillary is now participating as a Senator. Bill Clinton got caught with his tainted cigar trick and evidence from the Krakatoa of all fellatio, but I know that there are some others who deserved to be taken down also. I'm sure that Chelsea would've loved to have been "off limits" to the press as the Bush twins are, but she toughed it out too. It must've been very humiliating for her. There are some wonderful sites featuring news from foreign journalists which gives me a lot of information that we are not privy to here in the States. You just have to know where to look.  >^..^  Copyright© 2004 by Catnip Clemens. Minnow Paws. All rights reserved.

        PT AND I went out for our weekly Tex Mex fix. We like to go around 2 p.m. when the restaurant is less crowded. It was just us and two elderly men sitting way across the room. After ordering our usual sour cream enchilada platters, I decided to approach him with my master plan regarding my dreams of blog grandeur. In the presence of food, PT is putty in my hands. If I ask his opinion, he is a man of few words like: it's fine, good, okay, or alright. These days we agree on how good a thing is by stating how many chicken fried steaks it would get. Five chicken fried steaks is the highest one can score. The only time his eyes light up now is when I cook actual chicken fried steak just like his late mother taught me. She's not late, that's just what people say when referring to those who have passed over. Back to my long-term blogging plan. I laid it all out for him in detail, but this is all he must've heard.  Bloggity, blog ... purchase domain name ,  *%&@# thirty to   fifty bucks a year , crunch, crunch, crunch,  learn HTML , mmmmm queso dip,  some   bloggers get book deals .  More tea sir ?; Oh yes, thankyou. When he finally quit eating chips and dip for a brief moment, he said: " I don't think we should do that   at this time ."  Catnip:  Why not ?  PT:   Well, I just think you should wait and make sure you really, really like blogging and can keep up with it .  Catnip:  But, I do love it and I can keep up with it.   PT:  Haven't you changed your blog name seven times already, deleted three other blogs you started, and changed the color scheme multiple times ?  Catnip:  Yes, I have.   PT:  Maybe, later on we'll see about it .  I have to be fair and say that maybe he has a point. He has witnessed me dragging heavy furniture on a dolly from one end of the house to the other. Just as he learns where things are, he comes home to find that I have rearranged it all in yet another configuration. We really have no idea what sets me off, but this is definately something I am guilty of doing. Just as we finished eating, another couple came in and ordered the first of their Dr. Atkins allowable alcoholic beverages. You are allowed to have four Michelob's Ultra Beers and then you switch to Vodka with Diet Soda or Tonic. Wow! I would be totally crunked after just two beers if I am remembering things correctly.My last experiment with a drinking disaster took place in 1982, when I lived on the California side of the Oregon border. I was all alone, as usual, so after I ran out of beer I figured that I could simply switch over to Peppermint Schnapps. I remember my ex-mother-in-law saying it was soothing for an upset stomach. Later on, I woke up in my own bed at 3 a.m. with my entire body on fire. At first, I thought that maybe I had died in my sleep and gone to hell which I didn't even believe in and still don't! Uh, Uh, that wasn't it. It was the Schnapps that had caused me to lapse into a coma. That ended my drinking career. After I was divorced, I would go out; order one beer and let it sit there all night while I scampered off onto the dance floor so no one would notice I wasn't drinking. I was a very cheap date, but I was always able to drive myself home, too, if things turned ugly. Oh, I will eventually get what I want even if I have to use a skillet and some lard to perform my chicken fried steak voodoo on him. Blogger's ass is mine unless I find some other better bloghost during my daily cruising. Catnip is so fickle. >^..^  Copyright© 2004 by Catnip Clemens. Minnow Paws. All rights reserved.

      OH BUDDHA, whatever I did wrong, won't you please forgive me? I don't think chanting om mani padme hum could even help my wrinkly old rat's ass today. The sound of the alarm clock violated my inner sanctum of nothingness so I rolled over to make it stop that incessant microwavish beep-beep-beep noise. Getting a nice drink of water first thing seemed like a good idea at the time. I held my sleep apnea mask away from my face and was all ready to take a big gulp from a pint size bottle of water when it became apparent that I had missed the runway. I was now lying on a soggy pillow with a wet face, wet hair, and a water-logged sleepshirt. Time to rise and shine. I hiked half a mile to get to the other end of the house where My Bathroom is located so I could brush my teeth and put my mask away. When I opened the cabinet door, I found fucking ants frolicking amongst my brand new Q-tips. Dammit! I put everything down, washed and dried my hands, then tried to place the handtowel back on the rod. I watched as it slid down the wall into the cat's water dish. If I don't keep their water and food in my spacious bathroom then Candypants and his girlfriend, Molly, treat it like their own little ass pantry of snack treats. One of our neighbors cooks both our dog's a huge human breakfast every morning, so I guess they thought this gave them license to raid the cat's vittles. Not if I catch em! After picking up the soggy towel and flinging it into the bathtub, I figured I could at least go pee without any catastrophic drama. I had just sat down when I saw Cheetoe coming. He loves to dive into my tub and drink any extra moisture he finds clinging to the bottom. Before he took his leap, I tried to remove my roll of toilet paper off the edge of the tub, but I fumbled it and it ended up lying next to the wet towel. Cheetoe pretended not to notice which is probably a good thing. You know kind of like a Martha The Stewart good thing? It's only good if you don't get busted. There was nothing left to do, but try to get things ready for PT's lunch. He keeps buying all this ice cream from the Schwan's guy which somehow entitles him to get a discount on a frozen pie. I decided that I would cook the apple pie because cherry just didn't sound good for some reason. After I followed all the instructions on the box about taking off the plastic wrap, lining a cookie sheet with foil, and enlarging the pie hole, I set the timer and came back here to upload my blog stuff. After awhile, I smelled wonderful cinnamon scented odors, so I got up to check on it. Good thing I didn't wait because I pulled out a pie that was definitely not golden brown. It was the color of a very bad self tanning gel that used to be popular. I've always had a suspicion that God is watching me very closely because everytime I get really happy or have a rare delightful moment, it is followed by something equally dreadful. I think the longest I have remained on cloud nine is about a week. For those of you who find me sacrilegious, you are absolutely correct. I am that. I spent 18 years in churches and then attended a Baptist college for a couple of years. Things were no better back then either. I stupidly shared this intel with some uberchurch woman who tried to point out my failings as a nine year old when I went forward to turn myself in for baptism. She was just certain that I hadn't done things properly. Her sister is a missionary so she thinks that she, of course, has the credentials to tell everybody just how to do things right. I saw her a year ago after a five year much needed break and she was still hell bent on saving my heathen soul. Wanted me to come to church with her. I told her that I had converted to Buddhism and left her with her wobbly cart in Walmarsia along with all the other Walmartians. PT came home to his roast beef, carrots, potatoes, beans, and sunburned pie lunch and I got to pontificate on my bad day. Before I knew it, it was 2 p.m. and I still had not taken my medication as I should have at noon. Now, to be fair I should confess that I have not had any earth shattering "fun" or happy moments all month, so I am hoping this will clear up any retroactive karma that I might owe or at the very least go towards future bad karma. I'd ask Kwan Yin, but she's probably mad that I had to move her to another room before the cat's smashed her into a billion pieces. I barely caught her in time. They like to hook their claws into the silk mat I had her sitting on and pull her off her stand. KC scoured the whole west coast before he found her so I can't replace her. Anyway, all this got me to thinking about Monkey Cheese. Yeah, I know you haven't heard of monkey cheese, but neither had I so I googed it, found a site and started looking around. As luck would have it, my computer crashed and I spent more precious time getting it back on track. As an astrologer, perhaps I should check my own chart and see what in the hell is going on. Well, I hope you have a good day and I'd really like for you to look at  urlLink " this "  and keep in mind that Catnip is a warped heathen. She had watched Stephen King's  Dreamcatcher  movie the other night about butt weasels which scared her. She likes to share her fears.   >^..^    Copyright© 2004 by Catnip Clemens. Minnow Paws.

Teresa Heinz-Kerry was  "  urlLink  baited"    and reading this article puts a whole new slant on the situation. Shove it has a very diplomatic ring to it compared to some of the things I blurt out. I've told grown men that I will personally kick their asses if they annoy me even slightly and the men always tell me that there's no way I could pound them, but actually I could. It involves the element of surprise which I am very good at and having a chair to stand on while I do it. I'm 5'2", blonde, and what I would consider harmless looking, but apparently others think I'm terrifying in the flesh and on the phone as well when agitated. I told PT's boss that I was gonna kick his ass once for making him late for his homecooked lunch. PT's still there, but the boss was demoted shortly thereafter. I had nothing to do with that part of it, but I was thrilled when it happened. Now, when I call PT at work, the guy goes bugnuts trying to get PT to answer the phone before I come down there and whip his ass in the parking lot or chew him out. I, also, write one hell of a narsty letter that gets people motivated to do what I ask because they generally don't want to hear from me twice and I always take it to the top in the event that they balk. While we are on this subject, one of my faux friends used to go around beating up any guy that beat up her female friends, family members, and/or co-workers. She would go to their houses, confront them, start a huge brawl and come away battle scarred herself, but it didn't stop her. Her husband would see her come in and ask if perhaps she was out of her GD mind. He also informed her that since they were living in a small town, he would not have the time or inclination to be her backup, so she better choose her battles wisely. I think she still does it from time to time, but she's got shoulder injuries and a bad knee now. I went through a stage where I watched  Le Femme Nikita  and  Xena Warrior Princess  just so I could see some guy get his ass waxed by a female. It was therapeutic at the time, but I'm over it. Now, what I'd really like is to see a good sword fight again. You know, something Vikingish. Did I ever mention that PT is half Nazi and half Viking? Well, he is and he's viewed by many to be the tallest, biggest person they have ever seen bar none. When we walk into restaurants, people actually stop in midchew to stare. It used to really piss me off, but now I'm just glad they aren't staring at me. Here is something else I did in my twenties when I lived in California. A cop was supposed to buy our house and he defaulted on the twenty percent down through no fault of his own. His deal fell through, so my deal fell through. I was entitled to the whole check for the down payment that he'd given the realtors, but he refused to sign off on it; so Catnip took him to small claims court and won. It killed the judge to rule in my favor, but I think he was a bit perplexed and slightly amused at the same time. The cop still refused to sign the check over, so I garnished his wages. When he received his next paycheck and it was short, he roared into the real estate office, pronounced me a bitch, and signed the check pronto. Would I do the same thing today? Yeah, probably. Sometimes, I'm just impossible to deal with. Lastly, in my defense, I always try to be sweet, reasonable, diplomatic, and rational first before I apply the screws to the unfortunate soul who has decided to be a thorn in my side. I do keep a scratching post right by my desk so they will know pretty much what they're in for.  >^..^   Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.

        Purr and the world purrs with you,   Hiss and you hiss alone   .     Unknown   I HAVE A BURR UNDER my saddle, a pain in my ass, a glitch in my software, an unscratchable itch, a desire to maim, a need to piss and moan all day and night if necessary. PT worked in upper management for a very well-known company and for years and we had wonderful eye care, dental, medical, and prescription programs. All we had to do was mail our prescriptions to a mail-order pharmacy and we were done. It would arrive in the mail on time and all was lovely. Now, in the beginning it was pretty damned nice not to have to visit Walmart Pharmacy every week as PT has several ailments that all require medication. After several years of this, things took a turn for the worse. In fact, it's taken a plunge right off the top of Mount Everest. I am deeply disturbed because no matter what I do they manage to screw up at least one of my three prescriptions. It has been going on for five long years and I have fought them tooth and nail to keep them in line and make them send me my meds on time. Now, they simply switch me to some subpar crap and send it instead of what I am supposed to receive. I used to call their customer service reps and I never got the same one twice in a row so it was useless to even try to get an answer, plus they would say "things were being taken care of" and they weren't. Everytime I called, I would get a different story. It was kind of like the old "the check's in the mail" kind of thing. I, next, started using the e-mail route which was similar to conversing with a room full of monkeys who just punched a key and it spit out some asinine answer that really did not address my situation. There was never any direct answer to any question I posed, so I decided to go "Charlie's Angels" on them with a blitzkrieg of e-mails and you know what, it worked. I now have my own person who I can contact when the flakes decide to act up. PT thinks I've made everyone mad and that's why they mess with my stuff. The poor deluded man does not understand that they messed up my order and misrepresented the facts on several occasions to begin with and that is how this whole mess got started. I don't need a pharmaceutical conglomerate who tries to run games on me and I especially don't need one that seems even remotely unmoved by my plight. PT takes a bizillion more drugs than I do and they have never failed to send his meds on time or take liberties with his precious little pills as they have done with mine. My own doctors despise them and they tell me that everyone else is suffering right along with me. That's small comfort for all of us who have to deal with this on a regular basis. I'm done hissing and plan to go make some Catmint tea and play with Pooks tummy fat. It soothes my nerves and he kinda likes it. Well, at least he hasn't tried to bite me, scratch me, or any of that. I will share this final detail with you and then I must go. I've told a few people about this and nobody really appreciated it, but I know you will. Pooks got all his hair shaved off before he had surgery on his lip and he looks just like a little snow white lamb that has been sheared, but that's not the cool part. He has the cleanest little butt in the whole wide world. No dingleberries or anything back there now. PT refused to look at it, eventhough he is Pooks biggest butthole critic. Hiss. Hiss. Meyeow!  >^..^   Copyright© 2004. Minnow Paws by Catnip Clemens. All rights reserved.
