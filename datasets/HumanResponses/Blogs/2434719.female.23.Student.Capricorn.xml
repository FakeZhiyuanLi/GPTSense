       you live, you learn.  what surprises me right now, is how dissapointed i am. i just hate it when i do stupid things, and then continue to let it get to me after the fact. i'm not facing any consequences but my own, and that makes me frustrated with my emotions. ugh, i'm not talking about it.  O magazine's theme this month is happiness, and i took a quiz and i am officially happy. :).  tell it to the cheetah.  all i want is a nice day with  a jean skirt and flip flops with the sun shining on my shoulders..... that's ALL i want right now.  and it wouldn't hurt to have a million dollars thrown in there.

      a new meaning to friday night...  well, it's been a long day. last night was not fun.  i was convinced i was dying because of all the violent sickness and what not.  food poisoning? i don't know.... i don't know.  all i know is i'm glad it's over. whew.  i'm working on a case study paper right now... go downy wrinkle releaser.  did any of you guys get suckered into their college pr campaign back in 2000? let me know. :). might make the paper a bit more interesting, heh.  so the internship didn't work out.  they're "reevaluating" their staff right now, and they're not sure if they'll need an intern at all this spring. great. wonderful. grand. they'll keep my resume "handy" though.  i wish i could talk about the important things on here. it would be a nice outlet. i just hate that so many things in my life have to be secrets...   i still love this britney spears album, and i feel my IQ dropping each time i listen to it... or wait, is my sex drive just going up? heh. it's a joke. the sex is fine. (all people under 18 or family member or friends of family please disregard.)  ha did i tell you my mom found out i take birth control? it was hysterical.... she's like, oh, well, that's fine cause you're not having sex. i just smiled.   so i'm going to california! i'm pretty damn sure this time! i just wish i had definite plans about this fall. i don't know where i'm living.... that's hard. my bff was going to move up here, and we were going to live together.... but she might not anymore. so i was thinking i would probably be living alone, which is so expensive and that really really worries me. but my current roommate, who i love living with, said she wouldn't mind living with me again in the fall here at the apartment, which i would love to do too... but i don't know what i'd do about the summer. i wouldn't want to leave her stranded with rent. i couldn't do that. i guess i could find someone to sublease, but that doesn't seem too easy to do, honestly.  i know it'll work itself out, but you know how ancy i get about my living situation. i like things to be decided well in advance. i think this is one of the main things i stress about, my living situation. everything else can be chaos, but where i'm living has be completely settled.  oh yeah, i want to give a shout out to chuck! congratulations on your new job!! like i said, i can't think of anyone more deserving! you are awesome! (yay, go chuck go chuck kick butt kick butt).  oh hey you know what i miss....  MOST EXTREME ELIMINATION CHALLENGE SATURDAYS. now that's something to miss. and i miss having a washer and a dryer. i can't explain to you how much i hate not having one. can't explain...  catch yall later. love, hedish

      this is a test.  PLARS! PLARS! oh okay! so i went to college station this past weekend. whooowee. i partied till five in the morning! (okay so i stayed AT the party until five in the morning.)  oh makes me miss the good old days :). it was so nice to see all of you... sheesh, that was fun.  of course i love to see my bff, too! i don't think you know how funny it is to see you and jaime together, cause yall are so distusting "i love you no i love you oh no where's my duht la la la. oink oink oink." ew.  ew. ew. that's love, huh? :)   i've been playing cyber geek all morning, trying to mess with the html of this thing. i don't know any of that stuff?? but i did manage to add those side columns and change thier size. AND, i added a counter. go me. go me.  this time, i'm really going to go and be "all intellectual and shit."  love, hedish

       DON'T CALL IT A COMEBACK. I'VE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS.   Alright, as you may or may not have noticed, I have deleted my old posts (I think we can apply a good ole' ben folds five lyric here, but I'll spare you). That's right, I'm  re -jumping on the bandwagon.   Don't get too excited, you're not getting any of the dirty details.    RUThirsty3681:  shut up! (she really did just say that too.)   My head may not be as big as Kristin's, but I try to cram as much in it as I can:   most importantly, I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do this summer :).  here are the options: -stay in Denton. take summer school but survive off of pb&j everyday. -stay in Denton. work (somewhere?), and survive off of turkey sandwiches (meat costs more?) -go to Houston. live with the mom and dad. and dog. free rent, free food, a swimming pool, big screen tvs, nice stuff...  -GO TO CALIFORNIA. some friends said I could stay the summer with them. it's so tempting. and I thought that's what I was doing for sure, but now I'm thinking may I'll just take a vacation there?? if I go home??   what do you think? advice is nice. don't forget about storage prices if I leave Denton. I have too much stuff to lug around to other states and cities and what not. :)  also, I'm waiting to hear back about this internship I interviewed for last Friday. I had a really great interview, and the office atmosphere was awesome... I know I wouldn't be made to feel uncomfortable for a second. I feel I could really learn alot with them, and also, I would like to have some money to pay rent. That would be nice. Don't you think?  Ha, the "oohh wee" song is on my playlist. Makes me give a shout out to my homies at the MSC Main Desk! I don't know if any of you guys will read this... But this song always makes me think of Jason and Michael, freaking me in a corner at 7 am throwing check cashing money on me while this song was on....  Now that's a memory I'll always cherish...hee hee. MARY HAD A BIG OLE BUTT THEM TIGHT ASS JEANS WOULD SHOW.  I LIKE THE WAY SHE SHAKE IT IN HER THONG, OOOH WEEE.  DIRTY SOUTH! OOOHWEEE!   damn, that still is the best job I've ever had.  yes, so, okay. next on the list. school!  school is hard!  school makes my head hurt!  But what I'm most excited about is SPRING BREAK. oh yeah. you heard me. I don't have huge plans (I have a big project/presentation to work on... blech. and you know, papers), but I do have the greatest plans of all time to end it all. for newman's birthday/spring break, the ladies are getting a hotel room in downtown Houston, and doing the light-rail bar hopping thing around h-town.  dirty south!!  oh gosh yall the other day I ate all this cottage cheese. man.   I like a boy. he wears a baseball cap. I don't know how to handle that, honestly. since when do I go for guys that wear baseball caps? "YANK THIS."-kristin, on me telling her  that he wears a NY Yankees cap.  she always says the right things... I'll keep you posted on him.  if I remember who is he in two days (you know how I am).  REASONS I LOVE DENTON: --I went to my step class, and instead of peppy blonde alpha chi phi omega phi alpha whatever (no offense)  teaching it, it was this guy, this skinny little german guy! he wore a turqouise (that's how i spell it) and blue tie-dyed shirt with a big picture of a killer whale on the front... and he hopped happily to his  cover  britney spears album. I giggled the entire time.  --the coffee place I study at plays all my favorite cds, EVERYDAY.  ryan adams too!  --my professor actually asked if anyone had an arrested development cd!! my hand shot straight up; he's borrowing it right now. :) --there aren't affirmative action bake sales here. --their journalism department... amazing. amazing. amazing. this is why Texas A&M is never getting any of my money. :)  I've really got to get to workin'... thanks for reading about me.  I miss you :)  and that's the way it is!

      la dies ladies... ballers ballers... felllas fellas...   i'm really really really tired right now.  and i'm listening to destiny's child. that is a recipie for sillyness right there.  i really like kurt vonneget's writing style. i havn't read one of his books in ages... but i remember reading breakfast of champions in a few short hours, and i loved how when i was finished, the thinking process of my brain changed for a few days into a very vonnegut-esque way of thinking...  my scentences have never been the same since. i should probably read it again, it's been a few years. genius.  a very funny interesting crazy man.   i was also very happy with regis' writing in "who wants to be me" so you don't have to listen to me on literature.  i'm a survivor i'm not gonna give up i'm not gonna stop i'm gonna work harder i'm a surivor i'm gonna make it i will survive keep on survivin.......  -----you know i'm not gonna diss you on the internet, cause my momma taught me better than that.  one thing i really like about sociology classes (or the fun parts at lesat), is how much you can relate it to your own life and just enjoy the little silly things everyone enjoys... so many people are so alike, and never know it.  it brings people together the same way freshman in college come together when they realize they both watched the snorkles.  it can also make you realize how luck you are. i, luckily, was not put into the labor/work force at the age of three. and i luckily have a very healthy family life. and guess what people i'm pretty normal.  ha ha no i'm not.   IF YOU DON'T CARE WHAT'S THE POINT. i just asked someone that.  i am so tired.  oh whoa i'ts almost april fools day...  when i was a kid, i'd always fake an injury, so when my dad came home i'd be on crutches, or have my arm in a sling, etc....  he NEVER fell for it. he wouldn't even pretend!  drove me insane.  but i could get my mom.... oh man.  i'd HAND WRITE a detention notice.  and she'd FALL for it.  amazing.  something i remembered today taht i hadn't thought of in ages... was the bedtime stories my dad used to tell me as a kid. they were always about farmer brown.  farmer brown had this chicken coop, and there was always this fox trying to sneak in the middle of hte night and steal farmer brown's chickens. oh but that silly fox always got caught :)  goodnight kids. :)

       i wish i may i wish i might  do you ever have silly romantic day dreams, or is that just me?  i remember in high school i'd miss hours of important geometry or chemistry, cuase i'd be day dreaming about some romantic encounter with a tall dark and handsome man...   and i caught myself today, in the coffee shop, day dreaming about a romantic encounter with a dall dark and handsome man!   i was embarrased at myself, becuase i almost felt like the guy knew....   see there was this guy sitting at table near me... and this is a true story... he had his large journal, the plain-black-hard-cover-spiraled-with-no-lines-journal (if you know me, you know the blank pages were a plus -- he's a free thinker. he won't have lines tell him where or how to write... just like yours truely).  anyways, he was sketching and just writing in there for such a long time...   and i couldn't help but day dream about the man.    i had this day dream, that he found me so beautiful while writing my paper, with my messy-everywhere-hair and reading glasses... that he sketched a picture of me. (he was in reality sketching something, and looking in my direction, but let's just go with a hunch here that what i'm about to say didn't really happen... he's probably gay and staring at the guy behind the counter who serves spinach croussants.) and as he gets up to leave, he comes over and gives the drawing to me, and just walks out the door... and i sit there, in shock. becuase let me tell you, no description of this drawing can tell you how beautiful he made me seem in his artistic interpretation of me :)  so of course i get up and run after him.. and as i catch up with him outside in the perfect spring weather (no rain, sorry), i'm speechless...   ............and now i will allow you to use your own imaginations as to what happend next. (and no, kentesheia, i did not have sex with him in my day dream. sheesh).   i don't know i just sometimes feel like a silly little girl when i catch myself doing that. i thought maybe, just maybe, someone else does it too? i'm going out on limb here people.  help me out. :)   all i know is i want to love him and make sandwhiches for him for the rest of my life.    please don't make fun of me.  you'll break my silly little romantic heart :)

       ONE WEEK!   what can happen in a week?  not a whole lot if you live in denton, tx. i've been keeping up with the "do it" plan really well. the only problem was this past weekend, jmo came to visit and i had quite a few beers... quite a few calories is what that means. NO MORE BEER!  none.   there is no beer in the do it plan. none. ohhhh there's  water  in the do it plan, but you don't want water, you want beer. and there is NO beer in the do it plan.  cornbread, ain't nothin wrong with that. :) (or my other favorite: "take off that silly ass hat.")  i did have quite a fun weekend with jason though. i just want to pinch his cheeks and give him a juice pack sometimes. untill he starts talking... then i have to slap him.   ARE YOU COOL? DO YOU LIKE MUSIC? DO YOU LIKE ME?   IF YOU ANSWERED YES TO TWO OF THOSE QUESTIONS... my cousin casey, has a cd out that i want everyone to buy.  go to  urlLink http://www.caseyconnor.org  and you can read about it and even purchase online.  yipee skipee.  yeah so www.fitday.org. obsessed. i enter everything i eat, and it keeps track of my calories for me...  okay enough of that. i have a real life, i promise.  so i have this paper due in less than week now... have i started it? i think you know the answer to that one... but that's my life. worrying about this paper...   ooooh watch the daily show tonight! just do it, it's going to be great (richard clarke is going to be on! how did they do that?).... what's also great, is tomorrow karen hughes, WHOM I'VE MET AND BOUGHT PANTYHOSE FOR, is going to be on.... amazing! just watch with me, and be happy. and of course the one and only johnny knoxville will be on thursday night, yipeeeeeee.  oooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhh my word i am soooooooooooo nervous. i'm going to get a make or break exam grade back on thursday. i'm feeling okay about grades cause i did get an acceptable grade on a paper i got back yesterday.  i wish it was better though. oh well.  time to get out of here, do some research for the damn paper and start writing it. I WILL MAKE THIS PAPER MY BITCH. (it's weird saying that, since it's on the passion of hte christ. i take it back out of catholic school guilt).  ooh yeah. okay. i know i don't talk about anything personal on here, but yeah, here's a little bit of info just to get it out. i talked to someone for like 3 hours on sunday... and man, i'm so happy :).  i'm so happy about the way my life is going. and it just gives me hope, for those moments where i feel discouraged, becuase i think back about my past wants, the things i thought i needed, i thought i couldn't live without... and i don't have it, and I'M SO DAMN HAPPY that's true.  so for those days, that i'm sad, and heartbroken, i know there's light at the end of that long, dark, cold, rainy, miserable, rat-infested, moldy, hell of a tunnel called love. :)   the end.

       I don't cry; I work out!   if you'd like to be apart of the "Do It" fitness program (inspired by starsky and hutch) i have created with kristin, let me know.  :) we have a fun chart and everything...  i just know the past month i've been slacking off. eating peanut butter sandwhiches may be cost effective, but unless there's broccoli and a cardio work out in there it's not doing it for me.   anyways, the next four weeks are going to be hell.   so i'm back in denton. i studied for about four hours, repsonded to job opportunities for two, did all my grocery shopping, and even went for a quick apartment viewing with a friend of mine.  and oh yeah let's not forget that i created a fitness regimine in a pretty little chart which took for ever. (FOREVER.) and that's what i've done today. doesn't it seem like nothing? i need to stop playing around and really get to work. no excuses!  it makes me happy that inspire newman to write in her blog. hers are so much better than mine too......"i'm going to cure cancer. i have big biceps." i want to be a fighting doctor too! okay no i don't. but still it's cool she does that stuff.    LIVING IN A CITY ALL ALONE.  PROS: i love that i can do the stupid things that i think make differences without getting made fun of.... i can eat the things i want (i know that sounds odd). i can do what i want when i want... i can really focus on school... i know what i want, in every aspect of my life wihtout being influenced by others... CONS: i really miss you.  this is starting to get to me, and i'm tired of every single night coming home to nothing... and eating every single meal alone... and not having someone around to make me lose focus for just a few minutes to have fun.   i just miss having people around who convinced me to eat something crazy like cake for dinner, or will come over and overstay thier welcome until past my bedtime, or who will make me stop studying to go do something random and fun.  oh geeze this is crazy. i'm never like this!  i'm starting to see why people stick around. :)    i love going to this coffee place to study... and you know how i thikn nobody ever remembers me? i was so happy when the guy who works there knew what i wanted today. and they play ryan adams... how great is that? today they played the love is hell part two cd... i'm actually listening to ryan adams right now which is just a coincidence.   or was that why i thought of talking about it?  NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW!  i'm excited about the summer. i'm excited about campouts on the beach. i'm excited about drinking sunkist with danny and not working about the calories. i'm excited about playing with my dog everyday (she cried when i left!) i'm excited about helping kristin get ready to move into her new place. i'm excited to explore downtown with newman. i'm excited to write my greatest novel at herman park (that's for you!). i'm excited to eat my meals at the table again. i'm excited about early morning swims in my pool, dodging the spiders. i'm excited about the sunshine...  i'm excited to finish reading all these great books. i'm excited about always having fresh fruit waiting for me to eat. i'm excited about my mom's flowers blooming. i'm excited about my induction into the ya-ya-spice-club (don't ask).  so many things to look forward too.  i have nothing to complain about. :)

       SHE DID WHAT TO A BIRD?   if you know my mom you'll love this story... and no it's not the cpr story...  but i was talking to her today about spot, our adorable puppy, and how much he has grown... (i havn't seen her since lsat year so it's been a few months). so first she's telling me about how much spot loves my dad, and how funny it is cuase spot was just like me... she waits at the door for him to come home from work... she freaks out when he gets there and won't leave him alone... BUT, the best part, is my dad is doing the same things he did to me.... he won't be mean to her, or discipline her, cause he's afraid she'll be mad at him :). how funny is that? so mom's the bad guy again, heh heh. he won't even take her to get her shots!  it's great...  anyways, so this is the funny part. she tells me that she keeps accidently calling her sugar (our cat of 16 years who died about two easters ago). so she tells me, maybe spot IS sugar, reincarnated. i told her i didn't think so, becuase they have totally different personalities...  but she says, well, that's the POINT of reincarnation, to better yourself with each life... now maybe sugar is friendly.  how can you argue with that?  i laughed really, really, really hard though.   INTERVIEW TOMORROW. HOUSTON TOMORROW. YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY!!!!

      shit i'm tired. i like how i'm making this blog thing daily...  newman insprires me :)  again, i slept in today... it's amazing to me how long i can sleep sometimes.  i woke up and did about an hour of yoga (it's good for you!), and then kinda sat on my ass for a few minutes until remy called. i went with her and her neice amanda to get some icecream at beth marie's, which may i say, is the best damn icecream i've ever had in my life. i'm not kidding. and then, it was time... i did homework for 6 and a half hours at uncommon ground tonight. my brain was cheese after all that coffee and no real food. so i headed home, and LUCKY ME it was just before 10pm so i could catch law and order and watch dinner all at once... somewhere half way in there i started making notecards for stuff i'm trying to learn, and what do you now, two hours have gone by and i'm still not done. why do these things take so damn long?   so now it's 12:30 am.... on saturday.... on my spring break.... this better pay off.  i find it amazing how studious (i can't spell. geeze) i am these days... you can say things to yourself like, "maybe if i had done this as an undergrad" or "i wonder what life would be like for me now if i did this before and made good grades at A&M (cause i really did do well my freshman year at SFA)"..... but i don't do that. i can't do that. (you may think, hedish, you just DID do that, but i'm telling you i'm not :). )  anyways, i had way too much fun to regret any moment of it. I WAS THE SOCIAL PLANNER DAMN IT!  you all know it.  :)   gosh i'm tired. and i think there should be a LAW AND ORDER CHANNEL. 24 hours a day of law and order. it could be done.... what is this, the 13th season? and there's not just regular law and order..... we've got ci (criminal intent), and svu (special victims unit)..... years worth of entertainment. it beats that csi bullshit.  i'm thinking about investing in a new computer.... i'm not going to tell you which kind, becuase you will all make fun of me (minus other people in my field)..... but yeah i think i need it :)  you know what i havn't done in a long time? A PRANK PHONE CALL.   here's a little story for ya ags  it's sophomore year... fall 2000...probably a monday night... naturally, i'm drunk out of my goard. (sp?). It's been a fun night of partying, but I'm still awake, i'm still having fun... so i decide to do what i do best. and that is... the prank phone call.  it's an art really. i do it about as well as i paint.  :)  anyways, so i decide to start calling people... keep in mind A&M provides us with caller ID in the dorms... that's how stupid i am.  so anyways, i decide to call a nice young man in FHK... his name is lyle.   so i call him, and i'm sure i'm acting a fool... doing my best to keep from laughing (and you all know how that goes)... and i keep calling.... and i call again... laughing, laughing.... oh my gosh he's just freaking out.  WHO IS THIS? WHO IS THIS?  you know i think it's great because everyone else in the world knows its me before i finish the first scentence... this poor kid even resorts to calling ME, trying to figure out who it is... he even thinks if he keeps me on the phone long enough, just talking, i'll finally crack...   by 3am, he's on his bike heading over to UPD to turn me in...   i find this out because his roomate, g-spot (mike), was over visiting with my best friend's roomate and my friend, jessica.... lyle tells him he's going to upd cause of some prank caller, mike tells kristin and jessica... they tell me cuase i'ts funny, and of course my drunk ass is laughing CAUSE IT'S ME. I'M THE CRAZY PRANK CALLER.  the best part is my roomate videotapes it all cause she thinks its hysterical..... so now there's some drunk video of my stupid ass making prank calls...  and just to let you know, i confessed to lyle later and we made amends. :) thanks and gig em.   so i talked to my car today...

      the day started off really slow, and really nice too... i slept in, which was nice, and then i did some "spring cleaning." i went through boxes of papers and photographs i just hadn't put away yet... i found some great things :)  i found the haikus kristin h. and i wrote back and forth to eachother one night from the evans library on may 3rd, 2001... i found a lovely note left by the easter war verans, my "major girlfriends"... i found wonderful cards, poems, and letters written to me over the past two years.  it's going to be a happy box now.  and there were some great pictures too. i kept finding random things and laughed out loud at so many memories.  it really feels like another life time...  i try to explain how it feels to go back to college station. i know while i'm there, that i've been there before i know the streets, i remember specifics moments thoughts and feelings, but it's all from a past life when i drive down a dark street at night, i can remember specifically driving down those roads a million times before, i can remember driving a year ago thinking about my life and where it was going... walking to mcdonalds at 3 in the morning.... driving to work at 630 in the morning while the town was still in it's slumber....  i remember all these things and more, yet it's so far away from reality it just seems like it's a dream that seems too real to exist.  i wish i could explain it better. but that explains why i don't go back often.  and tonight i was thinking, as i was driving down the dark streets of denton, with its old buildings and twinkling lights...  this is just another passing moment, another passing dream... it's all gotta be going somewhere.  this all has to mean something. you know what i mean?  oh i saw a movie tonight. MONSTER. i had never heard of it (i havn't heard of ANY movies... that's what happens when you don't watch tv and cnn.com or the onion doesn't cover it).... good god. boy was i in for a surprise.  it sure wasn't cuban dancing, i'll tell you that much.  oh and i can't beleive i'm about to write about this... but i was randomly trying on this dress i have... (ken, we bought it together... the black one with the thing beige straps?) anyways, YEAH MY BOOBS HAVE SHRANK. i'm sorry to share this but it's such a weird feeling.... the kids held up the dress! they made the dress! NOTHIN. i don't even know if i can wear it anymore :(  it's a sad sad day for me... i just want to wear the dress damn it. maybe a strapless pushup or something. some toilet paper... but it's not even that, its the sides, they're gaping out at the bust.  cuase my chest is gone!   i'm sorry i just had to get that off my shrinking chest.  ha ha ha i loved that scentence.  okay so i didn't write ANY of my paper today. i did print stuff off? but i forgot to pick up my books from the library so that's not a good start.. i have to re-find them all tomorrow and we all know how that's gonna happen. :)  SPRING BREAK 2004! YEAH!  later goats.

       from the onion   Study: 58 Percent Of U.S. Exercise Televised WASHINGTON, DC—According to a new Department of Health and Human Services study, 58 percent of all exercise performed in the U.S. is broadcast on television. "Of the 3.5 billion push-ups performed in 2003, 2.03 billion took place on exercise shows on the Lifetime Network and ESPN3 or fitness segments on Good Morning America," the study read. "The abundance of TV exercise would create the impression that America is a healthy society, if everyone didn't already know that we're a bunch of disgusting, near-immobile spectators." The DHHS study also indicated that 99.3 percent of the nation's Soloflex workouts are televised.   oh my word, and please go read the editorial, "i can make things right" i laughed my ass off. here's a paragraph:  Come back to me, girl. Don't you realize that I am the one for you, and you are the one for me? We were meant for each other. The finest craftsmen in Europe could not carve two wooden items to fit together as well as we do. If people were to see us in a fine museum or someplace, they would think we were one item. From a distance, we would look like a single object, and only upon closer examination could anyone notice the line where we were joined. A lot of people still would not be able to see the line, and would need others to point it out for them. They would have to take off their glasses to look for it. That is the way it is when we're together. Damn  ..... (a few paragraphs go by)  After dinner, I will take you to my patio and hold you from behind as we look out into the night. I will kiss your beautiful neck and shoulders while the wind blows through your hair. I will point out constellations in the sky and tell you which ones remind me of you.   Then I will put my sting in you sideways.     lol lol.  okay, now i'm really going to go study :)

       i feel pretty, oh so pretty...  while i was walking around campus today, i've had this weird feeling... it's alot like the feeling tony had in west side story when he sang his song "something's coming"...   of course tony dies in the end so let's hope this all works out.  but i went and spoke with the career counselor at mayborn (the mayborn graduate institute, for those of you who are out of the loop), and she really helped me out alot. at the end of our conversation, she kind of gave me a brief history on the start of her career... it gave me alot of hope. (kentesheia, i will tell you the story too).   right now, i'm emailing my dad, hoping he can hook me up at exxonmobil's communication department. i was looking on thier website and not only do they have summer internships, they have summer JOBS as well... whichever pays more, huh?  that's just another star in the sky i'll wish upon today...  regardless, it's a start. there's lots of people in houston who would love to have a nice little grad student intern with them (i hope).  after i left her office i headed here to the library... there's been this preacher in the free speach area all this week, and i heard him talking about the passion as i walked by... and seeing as how i am was headed to do research on it in the first place, i thought it would be a nice idea to take a seat and listen to what he had to say.  i think i missed the begining, i was kinda lost.  but then he got onto evolution, and genetics, and i heard dna thrown around a few times, and the word ameoba was popular... but i lost interest and continued on my walk to the library.  so i find things on the passion. good. hopefully this ball will get rolling soon...  but then i forget my wallet in the car. so i talk to my car (i park off campus too, remember this), and i decide i'd go to the bank and deposit my check (yay for checks). so i come back, park in the same spot which i thought was awesome, and get my  books and head to check out. and wouldn't you know it i left my id in my pocket from the rec last night. damn it. :) they're going to hold them for me until tomorrow...  so here i am, bookless and craving a diet coke with lime like you wouldn't beleive.   but international relations doesn't start for another hour, so i'm going to go do some reading before lecture starts.  three blogs in a day, yipee.  love you all. bye :)

      i think i owe it to everyone out there in blogland to say, i'm fine! i freaked out, but i'm fine.... it was just taht damn scanner got to me and kinda, you know, unleashed some other concerns in my life.    but everything, today, is WONDERFUL. the morning didn't start off too well.... i woke up still feeling like a piece of poo. i studied, studied.. and then, i called my mom. oh moms fix everything. and she's right!  it's gonna be fine! if i just keep a positive attitude, good thigns will come my way.  and she reminded me of something i always think is important... if i don't visualize my goals, and see myself being where i want to be, i'll never get there! i have to keep remembering what is important, why i'm here, and what i'm doing...  AND she said i can come home for the summer if i wanted to, and work in houston.  that would make me so happy... i could save money, and i'd be able to afford a 1 bedroom place in the fall! that's the plan as of today, i'll let you all know more later..   but yay i'm so happy to be happy again. those 15 hours really got to me :).  OH, so i have this beautiful plan for tonight.  in about 30 minutes i will be heading to the rec to watch law and order. (while i run). OH BUT LISTEN TO THIS PEOPLE. THE REC AT UNT IS AWESOME...  every treadmill and alot of the eliptical machines each have thier own flat screen tv on the front of it so you can watch tv on wahtever channel you want, right in front of you, while you work out..... just stick your headphones in and go to town. is that not the most awesome thing you've ever heard???  then, i'm going to come home and do some spring cleaning in here.... yay! then some international relations, yep yep. (si si).  okay time to go! bye!

      my saying for tonight is: when one door slams shut in your face... you've gotta open a window or you'll suffocate and die.  appropriate.  i'm going to "wow" them, right? :)  my personality profile says i need affirmation to feel good about myself, so keep the self confidence coming people.  i'm feeling refreshed, renewed, motivated... the weather has been beautiful and that always puts me in a good mood. i hope this lasts through spring break, so i can sit by the pool with my NEW BOOK (so much symbolic meaning here), and just read and hang out with kristin. and oh yeah write my term paper...  this paper is going to be great. i'm going to write it on the passion, and all the controversy surrounding its release.  this means i have to see it :(. i just hate the violence, fifth grade flash backs...  i'm a big girl now, i can handle it.  anyways, i'm excited about my paper, spring break, and newman's birthday bash.  nothing is going to top it, that i guarantee.  ask newman for the details!  okay, new options for the summer/fall. it looks like i'm going to probably have to be out of my apartment by the end of may.  quicker than i expected... i'm hoping things will start to work themselves out pretty quickly... i'm getting anxious.  i miss the things i ran from... the sounds of a summer night, the clinking of presence downstairs, and lazily waking up to the heat of the sun...  i just want to hold my breath and dive in,  always knowing i can come up for air...  i just wanna go home :( sigh, it took 23 years but the girl is finally homesick.  i'm going to do a symbolic goodbye, and final physical goodbye to the past.... bbq anyone? :)

      quotes of the week:  "...and one chicken will lead to another chicken..." k. hebert  "sneaky, tricky, mexican style questions..." - my professor on his difficult exams   "oh, i'm wondering if there is some other nice peice of hormonal release wandering around Denton." -k. newman  "What is this, poo poo?" -d. hall   yeah, that professor is something else.... if you ask him about something you don't understand, or osmething you got wrong, he's all anxious to help..... he reads the question aloud, and exclaims, "HOW COULD YOU GET THIS WRONG?? IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE ANY OTHER ANSWER....... THERE IS NO WAY I CAN HELP YOU." this is the honest truth, he yells that.

      more accidents in houston..... oh spring break can't come soon enough.  anyways, for those of you who have heard of the creepy guy that stares at me.... HE SAT BY ME TODAY. seriously, what's up with this creep. i guess now he didn't have to STARE across the room.  he stares.  not a stare where we catch glances, oops, no he STARES. not at the wall, or the teacher, or hte other students, AT ME. ME. WHY! leave me alone, i hate you staring man.   i have so much work to do, i'm getting nervous about it all... and kristin is coming up tomorrow morning (yay), but i'm so worried that i wont' get enough studying done....  sheesh. wish me luck kids!   i really like katie couric... does anyone know if she has written an autobiography or anything? i'm working on the hillary clinton one (ken feels me on this one!), and it's really good. oh and oprah was the editor of the year in AdWeekly... yay! look at all these positive female role models i have... :)  but i really do enjoy a good issue of O, if i may say so.  ha, i was watching the daily show tonight (it's um, for school, you know, journalism?)... and damn that show is funny. maybe our generation has figured something out :).   okay, this ESFJ personality has gotta get going.

       WHEN I WAS A KID, I THOUGHT DAN RATHER WAS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  this is no joke. :)  if you know newman, you should read her blog spot.  well even if you don't know her, you should read it. i love reading it!  newman is one of my favorite people too :) i think i put you up on your passion soap box. i was really nervous bringing that up with you, but i'm glad i did!  i have this huge passion (nice tie in, eh?) to see both sides of every story.. (this applies to all things and everything). i think that's why i like journalism, in theory. IN THEORY. ugh. did you know, that on cnn they said a large percentage of our age group turn to the daily show for thier news? no no no no no no. no. no you can't do that.  i'm not saying i'm a news god.  i never watch the news, although i want to.  i just forget we have a tv, i SWEAR that's the truth. :) i try to read, i try to know what's going on.  and don't get me wrong, i still "greet the heat"  hee hee when asked what he thought about kids watching him for news, jon stewart said:    "A lot of them are probably high," Stewart cracked. "I'm not sure, coming off of robots fighting and into our show, what we're dealing with out there."   check out the article at:  urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/02/apontv.stewarts.stature.ap/index.html    RELIGION AND POLITICS... A NO NO.  the u.s. is one of the most religious countries in the world. maybe the most, actually, studies say.  i sound like my mom, spouting off random stats and facts that nobody can find.... heh...but i learned that in class :) i think i definitely had a biased view of the passion, just becuase thier pr tactics were shady (in my opinion), and you know, they're out to make money.. of course i think most pr is shady. please don't beleive anything you hear.  please. i hate pr. that's why i think i'm going to start focusing my degree in advertising now. (some would say that's not much different, but trust me, at least i'll be trying to sell a product, rather than my soul.) the more i learn, the more i have to get out...  i forgot what i was talking about. oh yeah, the passion. i still don't want to see it.   it makes me sad becuase there is an unspoken divide between strongly religous people/friends and those who aren't....  we're walking on eggshells here.  doctor! doctor! newman, i'll let you know if i have skin cancer so you can grow it in your lab. NEWMAN IS GOING TO CURE CANCER! i know this.  and have big biceps.

      they're jokes people. jokes.   please do not read too far into my entries :). if you try to figure some things out, you're going to be wrong. hee hee  okay so i have a doctor's appointment today.  i hate the doctor.  errr, especially this one. but the point is even though i'm at the wrong doctor, i'm going to find out if this is skin cancer or not! it's driving me crazy, and even though i'm not going to a dermatologist maybe i can stop thinking about these stuipd things... ask kristin. :)   i can NOT wait for this weekend... i've already made a TENTATIVE schdule of events for us...  yipeee.fun.hoorah.  FYI kentesheia's birthday is coming up! This saturday! She's turning  TWENTY THREE .  that's awful close to TWENTY FOUR! which is almost twenty five...  WHICH IS THIRTY!   uh huh. this is for the "meat" joke.   speaking of meat... :) i'm thinking about becoming a vegetarian.  stop laughing.  it's something i've always considered, and the past few months i have been feeling even more strongly about it... i think i'm going to read more about it, and work on changing my diet to incorporate less meat, what little of it there is already. the only meat i ever eat is chicken breast or chicken lunch meat and  you know what, i think i could live without it. (this excludes microwave meals that have red meat in them.. which let me tell you, i can definitely live without those.) any vegetarians out there who want to give me support? :)  take care of yourself kids... i've procrastinated long enough, back to the studying. love, hedish (i like i how i feel this is a letter. dear diary...)

      NO GRAPENUTS FOR GRANDMA  say it's morning. and you're doing your normal thing for breakfast: cereal, soymilk, and a banana. (well, this is my blogger so i guess i's MY normal thing, huh?) but wait, the box is almost empty! do you or do you not: pour the rest of the box in the bowl when it's more than you want to eat, but less than you can eat tomorrow. do you?   is it too wrong to combine the end of that box with a fresh box?   what's wrong with us?  i'll pass that one along to jerry seinfeld, he can make a tv show out of it.

       so a couple of cool things happend today:   --kentesheia passed her driver's licence exam!! --while i was outside talking on the phone, a heard a ruckus... and then a possum scuttled out and tried to bite me (from 9 feet away, he did). --i talked to my cousin casey in california! --kentesheia and i have establed the "fart" system. while we're on IM, each time one of us farts, we will just type "Fart" into our conversation. --and oh yeah, i won a $10,000 scholarship.  HOLY MOLY!  ten grand! i'm still pinching my self...  and it hurts.  so i'm going to stop.   what did i do to deserve this?? i don't have the words to describe my emotions when i got the phone call today. (you'd think i would, since i won based on my writing skills).   can i just say,  i'm proud of myself.    i celebrated tonight by going to the library.  nope, not the bar.  i figured hey, that's how i got this in the first place :)  goodnight, back to work!  I AM SO HAPPY!

       and we ramble ramble ramble as we ride...  i freak out about the weirdest things. it's almost normal?  so many things can go wrong, can take a turn for a worse, and stand there unphased.  now i see a mouse on tv and i scream my head off. WHY?     I'M STILL GOING TO CALIFORNIA!!  newman is still going to north carolina, and i'm still going to california! i'm worried i'll go there, and never want to leave.  too bad the plane ticket is round trip :). i've been trying to create a general agenda of our trip, just so we don't get there and jmo turns to me and says, "now what?"  here is, the general agenda, by hedish connor: sat:  fly into cali. it will be late when we get home so we'll just get settled in, and see what happens. sun: drive north, go to sausalito (5 miles north of san fran), and check out the scene, and most importantly, go to the red wood parks.  that's the most important part of the trip for me, to see redwoods. i don't know why, but they're calling me :).  mon-thurs: jmo and hedish are on thier own. we're going to spend two days in san francisco, and we have two other days to go wherever our hearts desire. being that it is crunch time at school i dont have this planned out.  but we will, soon.  fri-sun: woo hoo!  we're going to monterrey, santa cruz, etc... we're going to get a hotel room and just explore the beaches of california.  mon: i don't know yet? tues: we fly home :(  alright, it's time to escape to the wonderful world of academics. i am going to be reading until my eye balls fall out.  wish me luck!  fun!  and that's the way it is :)

      the other night i met a few friends for some drinks, laughs, and fattning food.  when we hang out together, we always seem to play a game of questions. The game is like truth or dare, but only with questions of truth and no dares. We ask questions like, where do you see yourself in ten years, how much money do i have to pay you to sleep with me, etc etc etc :).  well one of the questions was, "what is one thing you would change about yourself?" the first person to answer was female, and she said something about her body... and that started the trend of answering the question with physical traits.   and i got to thinking... how come nobody answered with traits that would make them a better person, not just a better mold of society's beautiful.  even i fell victim, saying if i had to change anything it would be my hairy arms. :) but, there are hundreds of other things i wish were different. i wish i were more patient sometimes, i wish i were more self-motivated, organized, disciplined, giving, and a whole other laundry list of virtues.... but, i do work on those things every day. if we don't try to work on our faults, our ways of life that aren't making the world a better place, what's the point of being here? there has to be a purpose to life and i truely don't beleive it's to honk at that guy who cut in front of me, or to shut everyone out while i stay too focused on school to realize what's going on in the rest of the world.  the way i figure, hairy arms aint' so bad. :)

      you should never go to bed angry.   I think that's actually marriage advice stuff, but I apply it to my life.  When I go to bed angry or upset, it's not pretty. I usually wake up the next day sore in my back from never once relaxing, never once getting the rest i was there to get.   And most importantly, I wake up angry.  I'm still pissed off! The fact that I'm still upset about this, you guessed it, make me even more upset. It's all just a viscious circle. I don't want to talk shit about the person. (yes, yes i do, but i know in the future i'll possibly maybe regret it). he's such a baby. I gave him waaaayyyy too much credit. I backed off for a while, BECAUSE of hte door slamming, the hanging up, the burst of emotion followed by absense and unanswered phone calls. "oh i've grown up i'm old and i have a car." whatever. AND I DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING. i listned to his problems, gave my advice (honestly), and i don't know what happend.... all of a sudden, he's pissed off and takes it out on me. well that was that. the end.  i have a group project today that i'm not really looking forward to. we have alloted six hours together. six. six.  do you hear me? six hours.  tack that on to the anger.  bye.  p.s. today, being almost noon, really hasn't been that bad. :) my banana in my cereal, was the perfect banana.

I WILL NOT DO LAUNDRY UNTIL I GO HOME.  if you don't know already, i have not done laundry since spring break (around the 15th of march). oh yeah. that's right. it's been over a month. yet i still have clean clothes! i have a bunch of skirts and a pair or two of pants, and of course shorts. this is great.... i don't know how i'm going to work this out.  newman says that when i'm left with formal dresses to wear to my finals, i should pose with my professors and take pictures.  "when you feel pretty, you think pretty."   one problem that has come up, is i can not fit any more laundry into the cabinet/laundry basket area. the clothes have formed a solid rectangle, filled to capacity. i have had to begin another pile, on my floor.   nice.  wait. i only have about 3 more days worth of underwear (yes, yes i had that much to begin with). I had bought more socks already, and finished those!   this may cost me more than a trip to the laundromat :).

       1000MBOFDELIGHT  who's jumping on the Gmail bandwagon? i remember reading/hearing about this a while ago and i sat in AWE... you never have to delete another email message again!!  deleting emails is like pulling teeth with me. and i still wear my retainers too... also, your reply emails are all saved in a conversation format... so you can see it all together.    I WANT SOLE CUSTODY OF MY EGYPTIAN COTTON!!  so, can i have my own bedroom when i'm married? i brought this up to a friend last night, and naturally he said no.  and so, i can't get married.  ever.  i don't think it's fair to make another live in flowery-foo-foo if they don't like it.  and no man i marry, will like the flowery-foo-foo.   and jason brought up a good point: women usually have control of the bedroom, and alot of the house... and the men take on the entertainment room or things like that... where the technical gadgets are.  and when i think about it though, i don't really like flowery-foo-foo. and i know he won't care about my super high count sheets. he might do things like, not be clean.  and i'll do things like, inwardly freak out and then get a divorce 5 years later of something stupid, and i'll blurt out at the court hearing, "YOU MAKE MY SHEETS DIRTY!"    scrabble COUTURE:  scrabble update: i am still champion. count the letters in that word baby. yeah.  there really isn't anything like playing scrabble in a public place. it ALEIVES the soul. give me a SLIBBER of that, chief!    WHITE HOT  i've been really happy the past few days becuase of my new sheets and pillows.  it almost makes me sad that this is what my life is coming to.   i say almost becuase i look at my bed and i glow with satisfaction.    breaking news: AREA FAMILY BUYS YET ANOTHER SUV  so i'm going to be freelancing again this summer. get this, for the 1960 sun! Am I the only one who laughs at that? Shit, it's money and more published writing under my belt. it won't hurt. now i have a job, but i don't have rent or bills while living at home... so um, yay!     MY FOUR SIDES ACHE  well, i got an A on that big term paper! AND, I got an A on my term project/presentation. damn, i'm good. school will be over in 15 days according to my profile countdown; joy is around the corner!  especially with this bright sun shining, there's no way to feel down.  the energy of spring green trees and blooming flowers can uplift even the lowest low. not that i feel those, i have new sheets.  now i'm going to go lock myself in the library away from the happy light. masochist. :)

       Hooray for viamins!   Your happy gal is back and in action. I may not be 100%, but my body is making itself healthier with every second of the day!  I didn't catch the bouquet! Hooray! But the wedding sure was nice ;)  Oh okay, so let's see, I finished my presentation! I did a test run to rocky the racoon last night, and he seemed to like it. And it was the exact time so I need to work on that, I don't want to go over 30 minutes... not only will I be over, but my classmates might punch me.  run on, run on... ooooprah. (that has so many meanings.. hmm who gets it? kentesheia!)  as far my PR update (i'm sorry people school is my life for the next three weeks)... going well! we have a 25 page paper to split between the group.  but i am genius! i had a great idea.... we split it up, between us, and we write detailed outlines. and then one person will put it all together into one paper. so it has one voice, so it will flow.  and luckily, i'm smart but i'm not that smart cause everyone else had that idea too :) i finished mine last night, and i just have to type it up and email it to her.  then, we have a meeting with our prof on wed, we're going to disucss our final presentation, and also give her lists of EVERYTHING each of us has done, including a tally of each task and how long it took to do them.  goodness. that's a list right there.   NY TiMES HERE I COME... err well...THE ONION HERE I COME!  i am so excited about next semester! two of my profs are pulitzer prize winners! how great is that? i'm going to take media management, reporting techniques, readings in mass communications, and media ethics.  you may thinking, wait a second, twelve hours??? no way.  OH YES WAY. well at least i think so. we'll see :).  (for those of you who don't know, 9 hours is full time for grad students).  i'm crazy!  well hey do you know what tomorrow is? TOMORROW TUESDAY... CLEANING TUESDAY. that's the day i clean, only tomorrow will be insane. i'm going to do ALL the laundry. do you hear me. ALL of it.  and i am going to vaccuum. and i am going to vaccuum my mattress too! YES YOU HEARD ME. and maybe buy new pillows and sheets. and i'm going to clean the toilet! (i hate doing it so it's worth mentioning.) ew!  it's the bed thing and the laundry that makes it a long day. i'm going to clean the kitchen too, and dust and tidy up, but i do that every week anyway...  i am such a dork.  later gators, gotta get to work.

      i feel like poo and you are going to hear about it.  i've had a fever since monday. it's thursday. i could feel my throat swelling up, but i thought i could fight it. i was wrong. i woke up this morning with another nasty infection at my tonsils. why. always. why. this happened several times last summer and last spring, if you  guys remember...  i don't want to get my tonsils out. it's a very nasty procedure when you're adult. my dr. has warned me against it, saying it's too painful and i'd probably rather just get sick all the time....... thanks to moving so much, now i have a new doctor who i will be seeing tomorrow at 3. if she says i need it i will hurt her. yay for antibiotics.   waht sucks is that i'm not going a good job of getting my project done. does this look like my project is done? no, no it does not.  bitch bitch whine moan.  bah. i just want to go to bed. i've been trying ot pretend that i wasn't sick all week... but i did do all i could to prevent what was alreayd here. i got immunitiy wellness vitamin booster drinks bla bla bla.... i exersized cause that boosts it too (and i normally do it anyway), i went to bed early every night.  yet here i am. sad and hurting.  bah.

       i can't get no...  my lack of inspiration is not limited to my blog... it's with school, life, everything. i havn't been writing and i honestly haven't been doing much of anything. i attempt to study, and i find myself daydreaming for hours.  what is this, high school? i had this problem even as i was getting my undergrad. i can literally day dream for hours.  i'm such a silly girl, honestly.  i look forward to the days i have my life set... my career established... i can spend my saturdays sleeping in, eating my 1/2 cup of bran and a banana (with 1/2 cup of soy milk naturally), making a cup of honey-vanilla-chamomile tea and sit in my pajamas reading O in the sunlight until noon.... here's the best part... GUILT FREE.  now that, to me, is the ultimate goal. some girls day dream about love. and don't get me wrong, being a single girl at 23 who's favorite shows list includes sex and the city, i day dream constantly about that great compatable mate... the one who will spend the latter part of his evening reading great books in bed before he sleeps. tv has ruined my chances at real life.  nobody does that but me, i think... well me and the parents on the brady bunch.  so i lean over and turn off the lamp every night...   well wait, what happens if i meet someone great and he hates to read? and every night i try to read but he wants a tv in the bedroom. EW. EW.  i will never have a tv in my bedroom. how unromantic.  ugh.  i'm already pissed at him for ruining my book/life.   my drama make me chuckle. i hope you are too :) and with that i say goodnight.  sweet dreams

       STOP LOOKING PRES. BUSH, THEY'RE RIGHT HERE...  well, my last name may be connor.... but damn that was alot of guinness. last night was car bomb night with dha and jmo. it was a pre-celebration of danny's birthday becuase i am not going to be able to make it to next weekend's festivities.  i baked a cake for danny, and jason (aka gene wilder) was bartender, pouring the car bombs and the atomic bus bombs (or as i call them, WMD's... nobody else thought that was funny, but i know it is).... we all got so drunk... my goodness (my guinness).   do you guys remember danny's birthday??  i always chuckle when i think of it... SIX MORE HONKS TO GO TO AUSTRALIA. when it's midnight and you have about 20 aggies together who have been drinking since 11am at tables set up on the busiest street of college station... you get a bunch of screaming kids hoping to go down under. now that's what i call a surprise party.     EVEN ERKEL KNOWS, FAMILY MATTERS  the night before last i went to hillsboro, tx, to hang out with kristin and her sisters, samantha and amanda. great girls!  i loved seeing the three of them together... i could see pieces of kristin in them.    NICE GIRLS WHAT?  i remembred something kristin used to say to me when we were kids... when i was at her house and thirsty... i'd say, "kristin, i'm thirsty." and she'd say, "swallow your spit." !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   IT'S A TOSS UP BETWEEN WARWICK AND CLEO  oh my word. my horoscope today. i don't even know what to say it was scary. well, shit, we'll see what happens.  :)   FINDING MY SPIRIT  so i finished my big paper. now it's time for the big project. here's the best party...... IT'S ON OPRAH. yes, you heard it right. i love being in journalism. words can't describe.... well as a journalist i should be able to do that... ah well. p.s. unt is one of hte top ten journalism schools in the U.S. go mean green!

      just for you, i did the quiz!!  urlLink www.okcupid.com  this is how i rank in relationships:   The Sonnet Deliberate Gentle Love Dreamer (DGLDf)       Romantic, hopeful, and composed. You are the Sonnet. Get it? Composed?       Sonnets want Love and have high ideals about it. They're conscientious people, caring & careful. You yourself have deep convictions, and you devote a lot of thought to romance and what it should be. This will frighten away most potential mates, but that's okay, because you're very choosy with your affections anyway. You'd absolutely refuse to date someone dumber than you, for instance.   Lovers who share your idealized perspective, or who are at least willing to totally throw themselves into a relationship, will be very, very happy with you. And you with them. You're already selfless and compassionate, and with the right partner, there's no doubt you can be sensual, even adventurously so.       You probably have lots of female friends, and they have a special soft spot for you. Babies do, too, at the tippy-top of their baby skulls.     ALWAYS AVOID: The 5-Night Stand, The False Messiah, The Hornivore, The Last Man on Earth   CONSIDER: The Loverboy

AND THAT IS ALL I HAVE DONE! i'm going to get dressed soon, do some more laundry (oh yeah i did that too), and then take spot to petsmart to buy her a new toy.    and then...  who the hell knows. i kinda wanted to day to put my new room together, finish unpacking, and most importantly, finish all the laundry.  good god my dog smells right now. she just got back from a long walk...PU!  and i will try not to write about my dog all summer. here's one for ya... CALIFORNIA! this time, DO say it in a jimmy from the wizard voice... california??  i'm excited. i'm almost sad to leave houston so soon, cause i havn't seen everyone yet. but that's okay, i'll be back..  i went and tried on my dress to my friend vanessa's wedding. i love weddings, but sometimes i hate paying for the dresses. oh well.  it's black, so i'll probably be able to wear it again. :)  but yay weddings... all those wedding dresses... it makes me feel like such a girl, but you know i wanted to try them all on.  i just do  shit i have to go... i have to do this when spot is gone cause she's getting jealous. later!

       WHY DOESN'T ANYONE LISTEN TO HILLARY CLINTON  i'm mad!  i just went to pick up my prescription, and the stupid company wants to make my life miserable. they more than doubled the price of my prescription because they want everyone to start using thier new product.  well isn't that nice. i really would love that. i can look forward to three months of crying.  i bought five refills anyway, and spent all this money i don't have.  consider this, a rainy day.  bastards.

       YOUR FIREARMS ARE USELESS AGAINST THEM!!!  after class this afternoon, i had a few hours before my final exam so naturally i headed towards the library. but it was such a beautiful day, i thought i'd take a nice little break outside and enjoy the sunshine.  so i bought a cup of coffee and great beautiful poppyseed-lemon muffin with almonds on top.  and you know how things like this really make me excited.  so i find the perfect spot, a table under trees with the perfect shade/sunlight ratio.   and then... i felt the wrath of the library gods.  they sent fucking bees man. "oh hedish is woussy and is afraid of bees." no no my friend. i was fine with the first bee flying around...and the second... but when they got thier friends and ATTACKED MY MUFFIN, i lost it!! i had to get up from the table, and my muffin had bees crawling all over it!!   the neightboring table noticed me yelling "go away!!" at hte muffin, and i had to explain the situation becuase they thought i was a bit nuts.  i had to leave it there... and go where the universe told me to.   stupid bees.

      Congratulations Addie!! You win the prize!  Danny wins second place. :)    THE ACOUSTICS REALLY ARE GREAT  okay so do you sing in the shower, or is it just me?  the thing is, i usually take it a step further. i dance in the shower.  seriously. please don't picture it.  stop it, it's horrible. i can't sing, i can't dance, and it's even worse when i'm naked. (unless i forget to take my clothes off before i get in the shower!)   CARELESS WHISPERS  tomorrow is the last day of the semester. i'm so happy that i will write a poem about this.   my poem:   dancing is best left to two naked left feet. jazz hands! you can let yourself go, listen to the beat. duran duran!  the tunes of the eighties are close to my heart. kajagoogoo! when you saw heart, you knew the rhyme would be fart. roll call!  now you know why i won ten thousand dollars. ten syllables! destiny's child likes to sing, ladies ladies ballers ballers. bugaboo!   robert frost, eat your heart out.

       HTML CAN... you know what.... ME   in an effort to spice up the blog atmosphere, i released way too much carbon dioxide and methane and now we have a large gap---no more links and quotes!   I will refrain from using aerosole, farting, and driving my car until this void is full again.   it's only noon and i've already gone two places. now that is what i call productivity. heh heh. this morning i woke my lovely friend kristin up at 8, and then i headed out the door to the doctor's office to get some lab work done.  they were vampires. the nurse took eight, yes EIGHT things of blood. geeeeze.  and i couldn't pee for the pee test (too much pressure), so i was given a TO-GO pee cup.  i've never heard of that before!  i still havn't peed... normally i would have peed 20 times, but it's the pressure of HAVING to go.   after the pee-fiasco, i went to an interview for a job next semester. it's a small job, but it will be alot of fun for me (i hope) and a way to make a few extra bucks. we'll see if i get it.  now... the library. yes, i must go back. and it's a BEAUTIFUL day too, which makes me sad.  the final i had last night was alot harder than i thought it would be, and that makes me nervous... but i can't stress AFTER i take it, that just doesn't make sense.   OH GET THIS. this is how spacey i was after losing all the blood. i came home, got in the shower, and DID NOT REALIZE that i was still wearing my bra. who does that?? i could tell something was off, i just couldn't tell i needed to TAKE IT OFF.  good god. get me out of here, i'm losing it! no more studying, i need my social life back so i can be a normal person!! this time next week, i'll be human again.  JUST NOW i told newman "i like to eat places." that doesn't make any sense.  maybe it will take a little longer than a week to get back to normal :)

       MAKE SURE THEY USE THE LITTLE UMBRELLAS EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T MATCH  you know what i'm wondering?  i'm wondering, when is chris rock's "no sex in the champaign room" going to stop being funny to me.  i have a strong inckling (you know what, i've never written this word before in my entire life. is that how you spell it?  have i been pulling a "slibber" all this time?) that the song will always make me happy.  i'm wondering, how do people find out about someone's death? now hear me out... usually someone dies and everyone and thier mother is on the phone trying to call everyone else and their mother as well, just to spread the word.  BUT, say this is someone you're pretty close with, or hold a special place for, but you don't really know thier friends or thier family... you have no common denominators. what happens then??? just one day you keep trying to reach them, and they never respond?  isn't that a horrible wonderment?  i hate it when people say they want a happy party at thier funeral. no you bitches are going to cry, or else il'l come haunt you. I AM JUST KIDDING.  there better be a margarita machine.  you know what makes me giggle? the thought that maybe, just maybe... after i die, someone will think of this and say, "she wanted us to have a margarita machine!".... and i'll be planning the party from the grave, giggling my decaying ass off cause you're letting me boss you around and i'm dead.  that's a morbid morning for you. the banana in my cereal was HUGE today. i sure now how to pick em.

      as i sit here, eating my dried nectarines and thinking about how i should be at the library (my away message does say it, and i shouldn't lie), i can't help but remember the beauty that is finals week.  finals week here, is not the same. and you know what, there are alot of things here that aren't the same as A&M...and i'm okay with that...  but a few things in particular...  for one thing, the library may be open 24 hours a day for finals, but do they serve free coffee all night in the lobby? no! that was my favorite time to go to the library.. free coffee nights. and you could steal all the cream and sugar packets you needed for later.  secondly, and this is in no particular order, but final exam study nights at SBISA! Whoa! those were the BEST. i bet i still have a rice crispie treat around here somewhere from those nights. everyone from northside would be there... "studying," drinking coffee and filling themselves up on sugar loaded snacks provided for us. i think one of those nights have been the very first time i used the mustard pick up line on a guy.   oh the "studying" counless hours of wasted time, staring off into space, talking about dinosaurs, and any type of philosophical question you could come up with!   I HAVE CHALK AND I'M CRAZY.  one summer night, newman, robert, and i walked around campus, writing messages to fellow ags around campus on anything we could reach.  that was also the time i had the bright idea to go to HEB and chug milk... or the time, we sat around outside on a break, trying to guess people's names as they passed by...   there was just so much going on, so much built up energy inside of everyone, that sitting in a chair just wasn't going to be the release we needed. we needed to be crazy. we were losing our minds.... no sleep, no real food, full of caffine....   there was nothing like it. :)  it's not the same, but this time, I HAVE DRIED FRUIT AND I'M CRAZY!!  watch out. :)

      i always think it's interesting to write in my blog when i have nothing to say... you never know what the hell is going to come out of me.  well you know what? it's 333pm, may 1st, 2004, and i am giving into the pressure. i'm going to do laundry today.  but i do not feel like i have lost the battle--i'm doing it at a friend's house for free! that was the whole reason for the standoff, so i figure i'm cool.  plus, i've been out of underwear and that's just not right. and as fun as wearing dresses to my finals would be... i need clothes that fit to be clean again!   i can't beleive i've been in denton for 5 months, and away from everyone for almost a year... geeze. i'm curious about what this summer will be like, and what next year will be like... or even what two years from now will have in store for me. it almost seems like hte next few years of my life are pretty planned. i'm headed in the right direction, i hope.    ew all my dirty laundry is out on the floor, and you know what? it's kinda stinky... kinda stinky. yeah.  i gotta clean this up.  baaaa. (like a sheep.)

      this is the type of night where i would come home and write poetry in my journal until i feel empty again.  you know i'm too scared to do that on my blog, so i will give you someone else's instead. lyrics from my favorite artist:   I found your photograph in a cardboard box in a magazine I can't remember you, remember us or anything I taught you how to feel, but you just feel numb They taught you how to feel, but you just feel numb  She comes apart in the avalanche Fades out like a dance Crawls back into bed When it's over When it's over When it's over And it's over  I watch the window and listen for the sound of cars I can't remember the last time that it was yours I taught you how to feel, why do you feel numb They taught us how to feel, but we just feel numb  She falls apart in the avalanche Fades out like a dance Crawls back into bed When it's over When it's over When it's over When it's over  She falls apart in the avalanche Fades out like a dance Crawls back into bed When it's over And it's over When it's over

      you know you're a lazy bum when even after you've showered, you've yet to put pants on by 2pm.  wow this is an amazing summer.  you know i've been dying to read all week (i did aquire a new GIFT this week. for those of you with broken hearts, there's hope out there).  sadly, spotty dearest has gotten ahold of my glasses for a second time, so i'm basically screwed.   tonight i'm going to see spiderman two. i probably would have never agreed to go see it if i was paying. but you know... free beer and a free movie at the alamo draught house is always good to me. then afterwords, it's off to see a band... that plays 80's music. oh yeah.  if anyone is going to steal music, it should always be from the 80's.

      little hedish wants to play...   i'm going crazy with this rain. oh and i may just be going crazy. :)  look, i just want to say, i can write what i want if it's midnight and i'm tired, now matter how "feel sorry for me" it seems. :)   sooooo, uhhh, you got any gum?  oh i just want to get some energy and be happy. is it change that i want already??  this is coming around alot quicker than normal.  i know that this summer is already a change.  i keep giving myself fresh starts, but i end up with stale results. i think i just need something permanant, for a change.  ha get it. a change of permanance.   maybe not.  i think i'm tired of all this.  i know who i am.  and i know what makes me happy, and what doens't.  but what i don't understand about myself, is why i sometimes let the things that make me miserable sneak in there. that's not part of the plan.  how do they do that? i thought i had a good system going...  anyways, so i keep having these repetitive dreams almost.  this never happens to me.  but there's this one train station that keeps popping up in different dreams. i wonder what it means.  what is a horse shoe? what does a horseshoe do? do they make horse socks?   maybe it was that damn sasquach.

      "it's boy vs. girl in the world series of love. the dream we all dream of.  baby... you got that look." :)   fucking royal. (it's prince.)  yeah, here we go. we're breaking the rules. and i don't do this often. i have a rule and  shit fuck damn  i keep it for life.  rule number one: you do not talk about fight club. (you have to keep a sense of humour at all times. that's one of the other rules.) rule number two: you know. rule number three: nothing personal.  i'm freaking miserable right now. i cried today and crying makes me tired... and being sad makes me exhausted. and boys make me miserable. and hence the exhausted tiredness of my meloncholy midnight.  it's not boys. it's not. it's a personal problem here. it's a personal problem we ALL go through, and don't even try to tell me you havn't. the: " what is it about me " moments. it's a time to cherish, eh?  i'm going to be honest here.   i think i'm cool.  yes i love dinosaurs.  yes i snort when i laugh.  yes i day dream for hours. yes i scream at cows and mustard bottles.  yes i read educational books for fun.  yes i laugh at farts.  yes i like to write in my blog. yes i sing to lionel richey at least once a day. yes i mis-label all the small states on the US map cause damn it, i just don't know.  and this is what mostly sucks, even though i think it's all great: it's not. :(   there are some things i won't shake. cause damn it, i'll always be a nice girl. and i'll always kiss with my eyes closed. and i'll......... oh forget it. fuck it.

      i think we have a problem. i am laughing really hard cause some guy called me a loser!  i love it! people i don't know are commenting on my blog!  alright, let's reminiss. (i dont know about this god thing, but i still pray each time i write in this blog to learn how to spell. i know there is spell check, but that's cheating.)  and so we get nostalgic on your asses.  so it's fall 2001. i'm a junior at A&M.  nice. it is, oh 2 or 3 am. my friend wes and i had finished studying in the fort we built of pillows in rudder tower, and have moved on to the MSC to get into some trouble. we're standing in the ramped hallway by the flag room (the hallway with the wooden thingies), and a football and an athlete walk up to us.  yes, i said that right.  so this girl in a football costume, and a nice young man in a football player's costume come up to us. they say they are going to the athletic dorms to serenade the football players before the game, and to pep them up.  we of course, were game.  i'll tell the rest after i ruin the story and tell the best part: after i introduce myself, the nice young football player says,  "hedish? as in the website??"   good god, it still makes me happy. i'm not famous. but damn, i was for one night!  so we DID go with them, and sang you are my sunshine to a err, happy?, guy, and danced around...      oh air. how i miss you.

      it's sunday night. i'm revising my article before i send it to my editor.  such is the joy of life. it's actually a bit short, but there wasn't much to cover (in my opinion).  i had this problem at the battalion, actually. "longer! more! bigger! better!" the editors would say. if you're asking, it seemed a bit yellow to me. why sensationalize a bryan city counsel meeting? it's what it is: a boring bunch of greying white guys who like to feel important. and oh yeah, the perky city secretary. :)  just kidding.  the city secretary wasn't all that perky. nice, but not perky.

      whatever. i just ate dinner and drank a glass of wine. that is to let you know that i'm drunk. or you know, severely buzzed.  from a glass of wine.  it's so silly i giggle.  well i would if i were in a happy mood.  i have this friend see. and he doesn't get it. and it's amazing, if i think he is the slightest bit upset with me, no matter how little, i can't take it.  I CAN'T TAKE IT . it really is amazing and i wonder if he knows.  so what i do is write in my blog and think of happy things:  -kentesheia scored 10 bucks so we are going to eat a chocolate molten cake from chili's sometime soon. -somebody is playing the piano downstairs right now... ???????????  spot??? -oh wait it's a stupid keyboard. must be dad reminiscing his "ross" days. hehheh. (lol the echos and beat are amazing.) -i made pizza tonight! i think i might make some dischinos too! yum! -lol spot has ran away from my dad's music, but came back to add some sqeeks of her toy.  -tomorrow is friday? -i'm drunk!  alright, enough.

      baby, you got to slow down. :)  prince is amazing! best song of all times, that is.  so i worry alot. i think if you know me that's pretty much a given. i worry if it's the right temperature, i worry if that will leave a scar, i worry about the environment, i worry about my friends, i worry about school, i worry about worrying. it's insane.  alot of times, all this worrying can get in the way, i think. "later i'll regret this, later this could leave a stain, later this could be bad, later i might wish i chose the other, later i could be hurt."  is it being silly, or is this being smart?  i say smart. i stick with smart. cause i have regretted, and i have left stains, and it has been bad, and i did wish for hte other, and i have been hurt.  prevention, my friends, is the best medicine :)

      hold on i have to pee again...   yay!! the pistons won! i was so excited about the gmae last night, cuase i knew in my heart the lakers were going down. of course, i couldn't STAY AWAKE. what the hell? sometime during the third quarter, my lame ass falls asleep on the couch.  luckily, i woke up with 2 minutes left inthe fourth quarter to see the lakers' defeat.  holy shit i just talked about sports in my blog.  everyone, wipe the tear from kentesheia's eye.  so what have i been up to?  let's see... i think i updated on sunday? well, on monday i baked a cake for kristin's birthday. i was so excited about it. too bad i don't do numbers.  note: when you're making your own carmel icing, and the recipie calls for 1/2 a cup of light brown sugar, and 1/2 a cup of dark brown sugar, don't use 1 and a 1/2 cups of EACH.  who does that??

      last night, andrew asked me what i was looking forward to the most for the summer... you know, what's driving me, what keeps me going in anticipation. dude. doing nothing.  that's right folks.  layin' like broccoli. chillin' like a villain.  some of you may not understand this. some of you may critisize this.  you're all just a bunch of jealous bastards!  alright alright, so there were a few more things i suppose. i told him i always love going to the lake, and i know that sounds silly, but everytime danny or jason even hints at asking me to come, i say yes before they can get the question out. i just love it. and i miss the beach too. i was invited to go no a trip to padre for a long weekend, but i decided to help my parents out and dog sit for them that weekend while  they're  gone.   i said it all winter: there is nothing like sunshine on your shoulders. and damn it, it's true.  i'm getting a tad nervous about my classes in the fall.  i just am. alright so i think about it alot.   so i guess i really am an aggie  I JUST TALKED WITH DARBY AND YES I WILL BE WEARING COWBOY BOOTS TO HER WEDDING. holy crap. i've never even worn a pair of cowboy boots in my life.   THUNDER IS ROCKING THE HOUSE IT'S TIME TO TURN THIS OFF!

       BATTER UP  alright, so in response to kentesheia's blog about the pres. reagan hullabaloo (no whoop necessary here), i have one question. is the media reporting what the public needs to know, or what the public wants to know?  discuss.  IT'S TRADITION, YA KNOW there were a few YEARS where three great girls would email eachother every sunday evening (or um, monday morning... or errr, wednesday afternoon). anyways, i'm continuing the tradition this week into my blog, cause i don't know what else to talk about. :)  FRIDAY: crap this is hard to remember. errr oh YES.  well, kentesheia had stayed over the previous night, and that morning i made breakfast for her and my mom. i think they enjoyed it, it was a new recipie but it still turned out alright (it's a step away from scrambly surprise). then um, we did pilates? crap what else. ooooh so i planned a nice evening cause my dad was out of town, and i knew my mom would want to hang out with us.  so i made dinner (and surprised the two of them of how good food can be without meat!), and rented along came polly.  may i say, that movie is hysterical. there were so many things in there that were reflective of my life it was in INSANE.  only kentesheia will get any of them, but regardless, it was there. :)  SATURDAY: woke up. ate. napped. the world was as it should be. i made some lunch for me and ken... then i took her back home, and stopped by danny's to see jason (in from OK)and give him our pictures from california. THORSTEN BOUGHT A HAMMOCK. i havn't been able to stop thinking about it, honestly.  AND DANNY MADE A BLOG.  that gets its own line. :) after that, i came and visited with my friend vannessa, whom (i have a degree in  who vs whom  and i still don't have a damn clue) i hadn't seen in a while. it was nice to catch up, and talk about her wedding plans. my dress is ready, i need to go pick it up. yay! AND THEN... i talked to my buddy andrew, and he said he was having some people over and invited me to come over. he doesn't live too far from newmy, and i knew she was up for something so i picked her up and we went on our way. it was cool to meet new guys and hang out and what not. then i came home early in the am and watched a movie, and then passed out.  SUNDAY: woke up, worked out, shopped, and then now, i write my blog and wait for the kids to come over.  i'm making them my special pizzas! and w'ere playing games... no swimming cause it's pouring outside though.  AND THEN... game four bitches!

      it's only a scratch??  so i found rocky's eye this morning. i'm still searching for his nose.  last night, my DOG happily brings me a surprise she had for me... my favorite possesion, the thing i would save if there were a fire, ROCKY THE RACOON. she brings her eye- and nose-less.    my favorite part about him was the nose, cause it was all scrunched up from years of hugging.   oh rocky. :(  i'm sorry! i thought i put you in a safe place but i was wrong.  i still don't know HOW she got up there!  today is the day i am mad at my dog.

      SEX AND THE CITY IS THE GREATEST SHOW THAT HAS EVER BEEN ON TELEVISION.  NO NEWMAN, NO! it is not only about women being whores and buying shoes. NO! yes of course they have alot of sex.  but USUALLY, with thier boyfriends, husbands.... of course samantha was the one who slept with everyone, but you know, in the end she settles down with the hottie.  anyways, i'm getting off subject here. sex in relationships is great, and sometimes, sex out of a relationship is even better and we ALL KNOW IT! :)  not only were they going through boyfriends/relationships, they had lives, families, work (good work jobs, these were successful smart ladies), marriages... parents dying, divorce, babies, sickness....LOVE.  it was great.  just damn great and yes i still get teary eyed over the ending. it was the PERFECT end to a great thing.  AND YES YOU ARE MIRANDA!

      the girl ate some food and slept many many hours... and she's back to 100%!!  i even did tae bo this morning, AND i vaccuumed upstairs and brushed my dog. taht's not as easy as you think.  brushing my dog is like having a gang knife fight with michael jackson. i have to get her rope that she tugs with, and we go around in circles while we play tug-o-war and i brush her as we spin around.  that is the ONLY way she'll let it happen.    you know what i miss though?  my stereo.  a computer just isn't the same when you miss your favorite cds...

      i'm still tired. not from not sleeping.  i feel like my body is dying on me. giving up. stopping.  it's hard to move. it's hard to get up.  i don't want to eat.   that really isn't like me.  i know i need to be eating more. i forced myself to eat all these steamed veggies when i got home.  it doesn't make sense that i can't eat but i feel huge. i think it's that i can't eat so i don't have enough energy to work out the way i usually do, and so then everything i do eat goes to the hips. or the less protein has made all muscle mass decay into the ghost of fernando past.  and it's hard to feel good and to go out and have fun when it's so hard just to laugh.  hedish making effort to laugh? that's just not right...  i'm just so tired. :(  i'm obessing. stop it stop it stop it.  sorry i just don't feel well today.

      i may not be an astronaut but i'm pretty sure my friends rock the universe (and quite possibly, the casbah). they've gone and updated my blog for me, as well as make the necessary changes to allow all your wonderful comments.  i do have one question for those of you out in blog land:  how do i make these polka-dots pink.  that's all i want and need to be happy.  so, i've got about 30 or so minutes before i have to leave and play soccer mom, and you have all waited long enough. here it is. THE RETURN OF THE MOTHER FUCKING BLOG! DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUNNNNNN.  i havn't updated since I got back from california, and there is just so much to write that, um, i'm not going to.  i'll be happy to show you pictures.  all you need to know is: A BIRD LANDED ON JASONS' HAIR BECAUSE HE/SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A PERFECT NEST!  that really was the best thing that's ever happened since the creation of cheese. and the whoopie cushion. and cake.  mmmmm, cake.   I LIKE TO CHANGE IN PHONE BOOTHS TOO  i went and talked to MY EDITOR (it makes me feel grown up to say that... where is my minivan??) and it looks like things will work out for the summer.  i'm not getting much money for each story, but if i take a picture i get double the pay. also, they have a magazine coming out in the fall, and it looks like i'm going to be doing most of the feature stories for it.  help! eek! any ideas?   GONZO MEETS THE SHARK IN FRANCE  it's been such an awesome week. this past weekend was great at danny's parent's lake house... i had a blast, and i suggest you go to  urlLink kentesheia's blog  to get all the dirty details. i saw and did things that i never, ever, ever in a million years imagined could be possible.  i've been busy all week doing stuff... last night was lots of fun.  eh i'm too tired to write about it. that's another thing, i'm always tired now! what is up with that?   YOU THINK IT'S A GAME?? ARF ARF ARF!  i've become obessed with my dog. i talk to her. i sing to her. we dance and play all day long.  something is very wrong with me...

      newman says it is my job to say things even when i don't have anything to say.  well her blog is upadated correctly... saturday, the ladies of hte estate met at cafe brazil for one of our annual reunions. it took us a few hours just to catch up with eachother on where we were in our lives... then we headed over to nikoniko's for some good food... then later to the ginger man for a nice beer. and she's right, us ladies  never run out of things to talk about, or to give eachaother shit about.  it's amazing, now matter how stupid the guys are, the ladies will never let you down. :)  on sunday i went wtih my dad to the diane arbus exhibit at the art museum.  it was really interesting... if you've seen it, we can discuss.  on monday, i picked the guys up from the airport (they got back from vegas around noon) and then i spent the day hanging out with kentesheia. i even vaccuumed her house for her! then we met some friends up at the flying saucer for two car bombs and a beer (all in less than an hour). after that, we walked over to minute maid park for the astros game.  i hated being a bit drunk at the game... i could barely watch!! but i still had a great time... too bad we lost.  tuesday... is it sad that i mostly worked out all day? i did get to go to half price books and pick a few things up because i got a bit of extra cash from a pet sitting job this past weekend. sweeet. go me.   tomorrow, i'm hoping to work on my article for the magazine, and then go GET SOME GLASSES. i can't wait to read again before i go to bed... or to read wihtout pain in general. plus, it's bw3 night so it's guaranteed fun.  happy newman? goodnight :)

      it's almost two thirty in the morning and i still can't sleep.  not even close, actually. which we all know to be a bit odd because i keep myself on a strict sleeping pattern of eternal nerdiness. i'm just lying in bed right now with my latin lover, thinking nightime thoughts and sharing them on my blog with you :).  let's try to nip this insomnia in the bud...  cause i've never been a flower that blooms at night.  those flowers have always amazed me; they seem to live in a different world than me. i could be a night owl, i think, but it's just not in my character. i think i am more regimented then most think of me. i think i'm laid back about the things normal people stress over, but the small stuff i sweat. eh, whatever. :)  when i first settled down into bed, i called a friend back who was on the road and needed some nighttime road trip talking. i was sleepy before i talked to him, but as soon as i hung up i was WIDE awake. i still feel that all my senses are more alert than they were all day.  i think it's just too hot up here. my parents like to keep it as hot as possible on the upstairs thermostat just to torture me.  no other reason.   i'm starting to look forward to going back to dallas/denton/wherever.  i have to, right?  i can hear my mom coughing. :(  but yes, back to school in one month from today... well techincally yesterday. one month and my life will do a 180; everything will turn upside down.  there i am away from the ones i love, and feel warmth only from my confidence of normality. that doesn't make sense, i know, because i havn't explained it.  what i mean is, i will know what's going on. actually though, now that i think about it, that's not true at all. i don't have a new job there yet, so everything is up in the air.   oh god.   lately i've been feeling more like miranda as opposed to charlotte when it comes to love.  i know i'm carrie and all, but charlotte seems to sometimes posess some of the eternal optimism that i usually feel. not tonight. and i think going back to denton is partly why i'm feeling this way. it's just so... lonely?  maybe i'm just preparing myself for it. ah well, like i say, i must stay focused while i'm there. i have to get back into the mind set, and i guarantee anything that will take my thought away from my studies is jeapordizing everything i've worked for.   why can't i sleep, damn it?

      so i'm sitting here with my ladies: kentesheia, christi, and kristin.  we're in my living room, discussing the days of "find the new item in hedish's living room" that we used to play each time i came home from school.  now let's get down to business.  CHRISTI CHOVANEC'S NUMBER ONE RULE OF KEEPING WEIGHT OFF: only eat at one mexican resturaunt a night. (and bring your own can of diet dr. pepper.)  KENTESHEIA'S NUMBER ONE RULE OF KEEPING WEIGHT OFF: only eat at mexican resturaunt's where you don't intend to pay. (hence, mass amounts of chips and salsa.)  KRISTIN'S NUMBER ONE RULE OF KEEPING WEIGHT OFF: only go to the mexican resturaunts that bring you your food, but no plates.  looks like us ladies are going to be thin.   NEVER, NEVER, NEVER EVER GO TO TEJANITAS ON LOUETTA ROAD IN SPRING TEXAS. never.   first, kristin would like everyone to know, that the place smelled of urine.  kentesheia would like you to know that it was the size of my living room (+ the bar as the kitchen area).  christi would like you to know that that obviously "fake" chips, possibly hill top or sams choice, from food town were micorwaved warm, and that we finished the entire basket before our waters came to us.   we let this slide.  we continued to eat because christi brought in her own diet dr. pepper, and we were too big of wusses to do anything about it.   our waitress, don't ask her name or what she looks like cause she'd have to give us service for us to know that, wore her hair in a bun. i know this cause i saw her back throughout the night.  her highlights, let me say, were tacky.  when we finally got our food (we had no water again at this point) we asked for two extra plates, because the four of us were sharing two meals.  we decided to time the waitress' response to our request.  after seven minutes of staring at our food, we finally get up to complain.  as we're getting up, the waitress brings us two plates. still, no eye contact.  now we're contemplating if we should leave or not, because the service has been so bad, but we decide to stay because we had been waiting so long to eat some enchiladas.   i take one bite.  we find the manager, tell her we're not paying for this food, and leave.  now, if I say the food is too bad to eat, you know there are problems.   the cheese WISHED it was velveeta.   we headed over to el palenque, our favorite for spinach enchiladas. the waiters were nice, we had plenty of water, and the spinach enchiladas were as good as we hoped them to be.   NEVER Ever EVER GO TO TIJACRAPPY'S ON LOUETTA.  unless you want to keep off weight by following our tips. :)

      kentesheia's right... boredom blogs seem to be the worst blogs. well ken. FANCY THIS!  :)  i just got off the phone with last year's exboyfriend.  it was a bit odd, to have the "so... how are you?" conversation with him.  i kinda don't, um, care too much anymore.  i don't think he does either, but i guess every 4 months or so we feel the need to contact one another.  i'm probably never going to see him again, and i'm sure the 4 month trend will extend over time until there is nothing left.  cause really, nothing IS left.  it was like talking to a stranger almost.  only i was in love with him at one point in my life.  but it was funny, cause he talked alot about him and i listned... yeah, sounds about right.  he did remind me that i once dated "the king of bullshit."  and you know what, there is a pro and con to that one there.  i now have the ability to see through guys' bullshit.  now before you and jason moncrieff laugh and claim the exact opposite, let me explain. :) well the pro is, I see the bullshit. if some guy tells me he likes me, but has excuses as to why we can't date, HE'S JUST NOT INTO ME.  period.  you don't pass up something like that for lame reasons, and that's that. the definite con is that even when a guy DOES like me, i have a hard time beleiving him.  i'm too worried that, well, that it's bullshit.  but i guess that's life.   so now for some reason i'm in the mood to celebrate.  i know two of my ladies will be over tonight, and i have a big surprise for kentesheia. oh whoopsy there, i just gave it away:  DAWN AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE. if you know what that's from, you're cool in my book.   CHANGE OF SUBJECT: so today while hebert and i were at HEB purchasing our favorite fruits and veggies, we were eyeing some organic greens out in the aisle.  we caught a produce worker's attention somehow, and she asked if we wanted to buy some lettuce.  we said no, because we had plenty at home.    that would normally end the conversation with a produce lady at HEB, but nothing normal ever happens to me.  after a few of her pleas to buy her lettuce and no win, she asks us if we're friends or sisters. we answer, and she says, "how long you two been friends?"  we tell her about 16 years, and she tells us that her and her best friend have had a 25 year friendship. we say that's nice, and we plan on reaching that mark ourselves.  at this point, we're trying to walk away and get to the cereal aisle, cause the lady was a bit creepy. she didn't have real eyebrows and tattooed them on. you know what i mean, she was a bit "tough."  so then, she informs us that her friendship is really special becuase her best friend is behind bars.  oh don't worry, she didn't do it, she was framed by her husband.  and also don't worry, the HEB produce lady is working on getting her out.  as we're walking away, quickly, we answer her question of our age and we learn she is 30. "well goodluck with your friend!" i respond as i run to the sushi station.  i've never been so happy to see imitation crab.

      the overwhelming nothingness of today, and my sexy new latin lover has inspired me to write a new blog.  yes, my new latin lover.  my best friend has been convinced for some time now that i need one of those. so i went out and got one.  my new laptop is my new sexy latin lover. OLE. i've been trying to decide on a hot name for him and his sexiness.  it's almost too sexy...  BUT I MUST!   kristin wouln't let me shower before we took our shopping trip so we could work out (we took spot for a walk and got pretty dirty, but no no, we must work out again).  anyways, after eating some chips and watching court tv shows, she has fallen asleep.  i really do enjoy a good texas justice.  i also decided, that if i ever had to be divorced, i will only do it on divorce court. in front of an audience that comments... and most importantly, on television.  and i want my husband to wear a big white suit and sunglasses.  he of course, may not do anything i like at that point, so it's probably best we're getting a divorce.  the kids will be better off...  and i only married him for the kitchen appliances, and i think the judge can see straight through me.  luckily, i baked her some carmel filled chocolate cookies before the show.  alamony payments, come to mamma!

      i think tonight, i'm just going to talk to your ass.  what a weekend, eh? friday night was spent at a wedding shower.  i decided that i need to get married, if not for love, then for the gifts. amazing gifts, and it's everything YOU want. no socks, or ugly sweaters... you can get an orange kitchenaid if you wanted, just for asking.  where is the love of my life, cause damn it, i need a mixer...  i knew after that, i was going to have to go all out on saturday. i started the day at st. arnold's for a few beers and friends. it was certainly meant to be because i saw a few people from my past. first of all, danny ran into an old friend of his from highschool, and it turns out i knew him too. i know this guy and i weren't super duper bffs or anything, but i did recognize him immediately.  the best part though, was ADAM BLANTON was there.  i went to school with this guy in grades 3-8, and that's two schools: st. edwards and seton. now that, is impressive.    so after st. arnolds i left with bryan to go to the astros game.  this was my first time to attend a game at the oj park, and i was happy to be there. although orbit was greatly missed, and we lost the game, i had a blast. this is a kind of random bit of information, but for some reason it stuck with me:  bryan claims he was at the astros game where my girl scout troop performed in the pre-game show for scout day at the dome.  seems him and i have been at the same place at the same time but never met for more than just our college careers. :)   after the game, we headed over to danny's so i could change for vanessa's bachelorette party. the invite said to dress in all black, and that vanessa would be wearing all white. that was a kind of interesting idea and it turned out to work well.  after getting ready and what not, i headed out to her future sister in law's place.  turns out she lives right down the block from the sari store, so that was easy. by 8:45 we all hopped into the limo and headed out to el tiempo, a mexican resturaunt near greenbriar plaza (by the summit. and yes, that is what i called it).  at this point, i hadn't eaten since around 8:30 that morning, and it wasn't even my normal protein-packed cereal. so i'm really anxious to get some spinach enchiladas. heck, i would have just eaten parsley if that's all they had. but get this, we had reservations at 9:00 pm, and by 10:20 when we hadn't even ORDERED our dinners, we decided that the service was just much too bad, and we had to leave if we wanted to spend enough time partying at the bars. sooo, we left. everyone had done a few shots or had some margaritas except for me (i was waiting to get some food in me).    so we leave, and we go to the sky bar near montrose/westheimer. this place, is awesome! well let me back it up for a second though, so i can fully explain what came next.  half of the party walked off after we pulled up to the sky bar, to go participate in alternative recreations. (please just know what i mean.) i havn't done that since i started looking for a job last year (get it now?) and so i went and stood in line to get in.  there was a line out the building to the street, and that just told me it was gonna be good. you have to take an elevator to get upstairs.  or well, you could pretent you were at A&M and needed to get to the top of the O&M building, but i'm just not one to do that in cute shoes.   when you get upstairs, and after you pay your ten dollar cover, you walk into a crowded room bursting with music energy. you know what that feels like, right?  it grabs you and pulls you in, and tells you if you're going to have a good time or not. now this was a live band playing, and i didn't even know this at first. they were amazing.   the fist song they performed after i got there was, I WANNA BE YOUR LOVER, by prince.  i fucking kid you not.   it was destiny.   my other favorite part of this place, besides the music, was the view.  i love the city at night.   well so a few of the ladies ordered some drinks, and this is when the DRAMA began. who out there knows how i feel about the drama. say it back with me now and mary j:  NO MORE DRAMA!   a few of vanessa's friends weren't really digging the scene, felt there may have been too old of a crowd, and wanted to leave to go to another bar.  now excuse me, i just paid ten dollars to get in here and they're playing my song. back the fuck up. :)  none of this really mattered, because soon after, vanessa was in the bathroom vomiting like crazy.  drank a little, smoked a little, vomited a little. you know how it goes...  it wasn't getting any better, so we get back into the limo and headed back to home base.  vanessa's future sister in law was being so insanely mean though. apparently, she wasn't ready to stop partying, and wanted to get a taxi so she could still go out.  um no, take care of her. it's a long story, but it was a pretty bad car ride between her bitching and vanessa's vomiting.   as soon as i helped vanessa, i got the hell out of there and called the guys. i needed to have some fun, and i'm guarnateed to have it with them.  i had hoped they would be at drink houston, so i could go out and dance to some of my favorite tunes. of course, a night without the ladies around means a night at the riviera (the all-nude strip club on westheimer).  yeah, good guys. ;)  after convincing them i was NOT going to meet them there, i comprimised and said that i would go over to danny's apartment (i have a key?) and shower, eat dinner, and then hang out with them all when they got back. i wasn't sure how safe it would be to hang out with guys who have been looking at female anatomy all night, but i was pretty sure i could handle it.  so after a stop to pick up some TC, i went over there, got cleaned up, and finished my dinner just in time to hear from danny.  he came home, and we talked about our nights. i was feeling pretty bad about what had happened to vanessa. it's just hard to watch, for lots of reasons.   over an hour goes by, and the rest of the hollister crew had not arrived. so we go to sleep for a while... then hooray, i hear them!! i woke danny up and was ready for some fun. danny. bryan, freddy and i walked out to the neighboring apartment complex for a night time swim. it was just what i needed. nothing exciting happened, but i couldn't help but think of college station days when newman and i would use the pool furniture as trampolines and do balancing acts in the sundance pool.   afterwards, around 6am, we finally put our pretty little heads to sleep. i passed out on the couch and of course, woke up around 10 am.  why, why, why must i be an early riser?? oh well, danny was awake too, so we hung out and talked for a while.  then, i got a phone call from my dad saying he was ready to go buy a computer. today. now. at two. so i got dressed (i was borrowing a cute outfit from danny while mine was drying from the night before) and came home.    my dad and i ended up picking bryan and danny up to help us on our endeavors. we went to the apple store in the galleria, and i am proud to announce that i am writing this blog on my very own powerbook.  i don't know why i was so weireded out by the whole situation. it's amazing how every bit of knowledge i have drains away from my brain and into my ass when i walk into a store like that. instead of expressing my thoughts and emotions like a normal human being, i start dancing around with excitement. plus i don't know what the hell i'm talking about so i feel it's best to keep my mouth shut and smile.   so yeah, i have a powerbook!! and i hate to brag, but i must... i also now have a new ipod. there was a special rebate deal if we bought both.  i think they were just trying to get rid of them with this new special thing that's coming out, but i don't care one bit. i have an ipod!! i've been working on transfering all my mp3s through the wireless network onto my laptop. i have about 1,400. i've actually lost quite a bit over the years, and i'm desperate to start downloading again.  when the most current song you have is from fall of your junior year, and you have an ipod, you get a big ancy for these things.  i think one of my favorite parts of that shopping trip, was seeing the guys with my dad.  my dad is a really introverted guy, and having htem joke around with him was great. i think he was actually into danny's idea of building an isengard in houston... but i don't think he was as supportive when they tried to convince him i was at the strip club the previous night.   i spent the rest of sunday night playing on this wonderful new toy.   it even smells nice. i can't explain that, but you know how i am about smells.  could this be, the most thourough and longest blog in the history of "you hate me like you hate to eat your wheaties?"  i don't even eat wheaties. i don't get it. :)

       sunrise, sunrise...    &nbsp;  i hung out with the 335 crew (+ 1) (that was a SATC joke girls), last night and naturally we did what was best.&nbsp; we ate spinach enchiladas, and laid like broccoli watching sex in the city.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  i must take this time though, to thank kentesheia for stealing several newspapers from the neighbors she doesn't care for.&nbsp; my article made front page,  ABOVE the fold , thank you very much.&nbsp; it's nice to see that you care!     &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      i had no idea that's how you spell that.  i was thinking... (brace yourselves)  you know how there are words that can't be translated from one language to another?  does that drive you crazy, or is it just me?  but then i thought to myself, is that really that strange?  cause i always found it hard to beleive, that a feeling or a point of view or a thought couldn't be communicated, or translated, yet someone else could learn it or feel it.  or something. do you see where i'm going with this.  no? me either.  but the somewhat point of it is......... when i thought about it, it kind of makes sense. because most of my days, i can't even communicate or express basic human emotion.   wait. no.  wait.  my throat hurts.

      man. i know lately the blog has become an outlet for constant ocmplaing.   well, yeah.  my glands!! my throat is killing me. i can't even see my throat anymore, honestly, becasue everything is swelling shut.   it's grand, it really is.   HAPPY STUFF. this weekend, was AWESOME! i definitely need to head back to that sari shop and get some material of my own. I wanted to wait until I had a few more dollars in my pocket before i went and spent a whole ten dollars on something useful. i do get paid today for pet sitting so it's a definite possibility. and i got a nice little check yesterday for babysitting (and well, er, being a camp counselor for K-2nd graders at a church choir camp. oh yeah. you read that right). but i'd like some of that material to decorate, and SOME TO WEAR. one of hte ladies at the shop showed me how to wear the sari, and damn it, it looks good!! they've really got something going on there...  hey wow that was a whole paragraph there. go hedish.  well, the weekend was all around great. i had a bit of down time, which i'm sure everyone could tell. i just wasn't feeling myself, and i was letting things get to me. and i realized things this week too, which has made getting over things (and people) much easier.  a whole hell of alot easier. to the point where i'm finished with this. no problems, no worries.  plus this coming saturday is gonna rock as well. (do a danny "rock" motion here.)  i love that if a full scentence is in parenthesis, you put the punctuation inside. i just love doing that.

      RUThirsty3681: how long are u gonna be in this slump?  that's a damn good question, ken.   i have a feeling this weekend will be awesome.  tonight, maybe no so much. i'm feeling a bit sick today and staying in will probably be my best bet.  but tomorrow! saturday is the day!! i'm going to do a bit of thrift store shopping, i'm going to do some indian shopping, and i'm going to eat some vegetarian indian food.  now, this is a huge step for me. i'm not a big fan of indian food becasue of a past roomate who ate that and only that 24 hours a day.  she ate constantly.  don't worry, she did her rope workouts on the door at 6 in the morning, so it's all okay.   i remember, i used to always run in the door to our room and SMACK her with it.   lol, those were the days.  so anyways, i'm going to hang out with my LADIES.  do you hear me? THE LADIES. these girls, newman, kristin, and kentesheia, may quite possibly be the greatest friends i have ever had. we never have drama. well, with eachother. we never fight. we never get jealous, and we're always supportive.  people have a stereotype of PRETTY GIRLS like us, and damn it, we're amazing.  i just need to be cheered up. i need to act stupid in public. i need to talk to strangers. i need to LAUGH MY ASS OFF WITH MY LADIES!  AND DAMN IT, I WILL! :)

       CLEARASIL MAY NOT HELP THESE DAYS  although i keep finding more and more, i think the total number of ant bites on my foot is just over FIFTY. note to all those out there in blogland: if you're going to pee behind a sign in conroe, make sure you're not going to be standing in a fire ant pile.  just a little tip there for you.   SING IT ELTON... ROUND AND ROUND WE GO.  hey remember how i found an envelope full of cash?  well i contacted the guy, and he came to pick it up... but get this, he wasn't at all greatful!! he didn't even realize he had lost it, and his "gratitude" came out in a unenthusiastic "yeah, cool, thanks."  i could be $221 dollars richer right now.  BUT, luckily i got a pet sitting job for the next week that's going to give me $100 to blow on unessecary things. i can't wait.  what goes around comes around i suppose. i can't wait to see waht happens to those ants.   well actually, maybe i got what i deserved for peeing on thier home.  yeah, things are right in the world.     SIXTY SONGS OF PURE HAPPINESS  i had the best time in conroe. i couldn't beleive how smashed i got both nights there. the first night i got a little out of control, but in a giggly way (as far as i've heard).  night two was  powerhour .  powerhour  will kill you. i had the best time during it, and i beleive bryan may be the smartest man to exist for creating that cd of songs to keep you going.   the word  powerhour  must always be bolded, strictly out of respect.  my arms are sore though. i don't know if it's from holding onto danny's boat for dear life (oh the motion sickness), or if it was from holding a brick over my head for about 20 minutes.   probably a little of both.   "AND THAT'S THE WAY IT IS"  saturday worked out just fine. actually, things worked out better than i ever imagined. go hedish for being prepared for once and having everything work out. i covered the first story just fine, even with a few camera problems i think everything was okay. i came home, emailed the pictures to my editor and wrote up a tiny story to go with it. not long at all.  then i was even able to eat lunch before i headed out to the next thing. this story was about a guy named scott larson who died in iraq. he was only 22 years old, and that kinda gets to me sometimes, knowing that he was younger than me.   anyways, the initial dedication wasn't all that special, but i did like meeting all the people in person taht i had interviewd on the phone. (well, i only met a few of them.) but this was the best part... see, when you're doing stuff like this, and your name is hedish, you can't help but get emotionally involved. biggest rule broken,  maybe?  anyways, i spoke a long while with his mother and father. they invited me over to thier house (don't tell my mom) to watch a memorial service that was given in baghdad for scott by his friends in the military.  it was really moving to see, and i was really surprised they were so gracious and kind to me, and nie enough to let me in thier house to watch something so personal. i was the first person besides family who has been allowed to watch it.    i don't know, i just thought it was nice. i got a bit teary, but i don't think that's a bad thing, hoenstly.  do you?

      I've been working all afternoon on two stories i'm covering this weekend. I think I actually have most of one written, since i called my editor after an interview or two and asked him if I could do a feature/profile story on one of the articles instead of just a news story.  i think the first assignment is a bit hokey, but they really need the pictures and article on the front page for the issue following the fourth of july, so i gotta get it done.  but i'm really wrapped up in the second assignment. maybe it's because i'm actually feeling inspired to write it!   i've never liked writing news stories. i did it everyday for class, and it drove me batty.  let's not forget my time with A&M's oh so wonderful (sarcasm sarcasm) newspaper, The Battalion. If you went to A&M, I just want to show you another school newspaper so you can see how jipped you were/are. But i've never been one to bash the batt, and i dont want to do that now. I was a part of that team, and I really did and still do respect those that work(ed) on it.   so what about those schools with the great papers? oh yeah, they were well funded,  respected , and had functioning journalism departments. and they like to hear both sides of the story.  amazing what that will do.  ANYWAYS the point is,  i'm actually feeling inspired to write again.   saturday is going to be chaos, running around from place to place trying to meet deadline and covering two things in one day. but i hope it's well worth it. my secret goal is to actually have them finished by saturday night, so i can still go up to conroe. i'll bring it on a disk and email, that way i can wake up early on the fourth, do some last minute edits on story #2 (story #1 is due as soon as i go and write it), and email it to my editor.   i'm going to work all day tomorrow on finishing these interviews, and creating a base outline of my article so everything can go smoothly on saturday.  wish me luck. :)

      i realized something just now.  do you remember the blogs of the past, the ones with substance? i wrote about my daydreams...  sitting in the coffeehouse, day dreaming for hours. and hours. and hours of life, gone.  my mom had a good point today. and i never say taht, you know?  it's going to change.   and she said, when she met my dad, it was so easy. nothing was complicated.  he came when she least expected it.  convinced happily ever after was only in fairy tales.  oh but the daydream taht walked into uncommon ground while i was high on caffeine and drifting into ryan adams' heart as i lazily finished a crossword puzzle. the one who wrote in his journal ever day. a plain black covered journal, sprial bound, no lines. larger than mine, but that's expected: i like things strong yet dainty. :)  my best journals were solid, sprial bound, plain sheet journals.  my best journals were filled with insane heartbreak from a girl without a clue. lower than low depression with a hint of optimism.  these days i'm too drifty to write anything good.  oh but this guy. he was a bit scruffy around the edges, tall and dark. wore glasses.  he didn't buy the fancy coffee. i hate the fancy coffee.  wore a plain white t-shirt.  a nice, clean white tshirt. nothing scruffy or worn. the kind that is soft and smells like him. ladies you know what i mean.   WELL TODAY IS THE DAY I SAY FUCK THE SENSITIVE WRITER. TODAY IS THE DAY I SAY FUCK YOU!    :) i feel great!
