      Okay, we have missed school for like forever and a day because of the snowy weather, which was definitely God's gift to me to use as mental health days. I finally have some things right in my life and have learning to live by this quote:  A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.  Please don't hate me forever. I am dreamer so you sent me away............

       Round Here  Step out the front door like a ghost into the fog where no one notices the contrast of white on white. And in between the moon and you the angels get a better view of the crumbling difference between wrong and right. I walk in the air between the rain through myself and back again Where? I don't know Maria says she's dying through the door I hear her crying Why? I don't know [Chorus] Round here we always stand up straight Round here something radiates Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand she said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land just like she's walking on a wire in the circus she parks her car outside of my house takes her clothes off says she's close to understanding Jesus she knows she's just a little misunderstood she has trouble acting normal when she's nervous [Chorus:]  Round here we're carving out our names Round here we all look the same Round here we talk just like lions But we sacrifice like lambs Round here she's slipping through my hands Sleeping children better run like the wind out of the lightning dream Mama's little baby better get herself in out of the lightning She says It's only in my head She says Shhh I know it's only in my head But the girl in car in the parking lot says "Man you should try to take a shot can't you see my walls are crumbling?" Then she looks up at the building and says she's thinking of jumping She says she's tired of life she must be tired of something Round here she's always on my mind Round here hey man got lots of time Round here we're never sent to bed early And nobody makes us wait Round here we stay up very, very, very, very late     Stop playing God

      As i grow older and life changes, I struggle with a concept that I was presented with years ago. Is life as we see it and life how it actually is, two totally different things? Will reality or does reality coincide with how life is or is life all in our perception of it and it changes as we grow older and we change as our perception of what we know to be reality changes?   (You know who you are if this is to you). Right now, I want to forget you and everything and just start from scratch and no matter how much I want to, I can't do it. Give me time, hopefully I will come around sometime.

      Okay, I am sitting here in Computer Apps. bored out of my mind and so I decided to finally hit up my blog again.  Things are coming back together in my life and maybe I can have the rest of the year with no more downfalls. That would be awesome. Jesus Christ is the friggin man. Number one! I'm starting to listen to country music, which is scaring me, but its pretty kew!I am passing in school finally and straight chilling. Love you all very much! I won't be online anytime soon because I have no computer.  ...................You'll think of me.............

      Today was a good day. Snow was faliing everywhere this morning and I was sure that we wouldn't have school or stay there for the whole day but we did. I'm beginning to finally after almost a year, be content again in my life and am becoming more happy and alive since depression entered my life. Kinda sad way to waste two years of your life, but everything happens for a reason and I must go on with the show. It's Valentines Day soon and to all you lonely people: You aren't alone. There are other lonely people to be with so you won't be lonely. Love all of you tons!   Everything's coming back together and I don't expect it to happen, but I still drown in the possibilities of one thing that would make my life fuller.   And I am a dreamer so you sent me away........sometimes we dreamers, just get in the way.

      This week is flying by me so quickly. I don't know where time goes.  Today was rather good although yesterday burnt me out and made me realize what a cat and mouse game that high school is. I shall not frown on that though, just do my own thing and straight kick it like I always do. I finally realized that I am growing up and am slowly but surely leaving my teenage years and kind of look forward to it a lot more than it scares me. I finally have my Eagle Scout (although it isn't 100 percent complete) and I have relearned that there are other things to life besides girls and school (which are both very nice things. teehee!), and am trying to focus my energy on things better and more helpful to myself and to the world as a whole. I got to play this game where you shoot people at school today! Our schools lil block thing didn't block it! Kinda sad but it was fun until I kept dying. I am now officially addicted to Tron now, so I might be a Tron nerd, but ah well! Love ya guys!  (Yes I know I'm probably a boring person!) Love you all! Take care.

      This was an excellent weekend. I got to spend saturday with Michael, my very British friend. I think I scared him singing Destiny's Child but we had a blast. We hooked it up with some other emo kids and somehow I talked myself into buying the new Blink album. It's surprisingly very well done. I still have to watch how I say certain words after spending the day with Mikey, because I am starting to talk British. You know I love ya man! Today, I finally kept a plan and went on a walk with my dear friend Annen and got to see the wonderful world of Salem Academy! I need to go back down there and  try to pimp. I used to be a mormon pimp, but that kind of fell apart. Love ya guys! Check out the new Blink album, It is really good.

      it takes more time than i've ever had drains the life from me makes me want to forget as young as i was, i felt older back then more disciplined, stronger and certain but i was scared to death of eternity i was saved by grace but destroyed by naivety and i lied to myself and said it was for the best so now faith is replaced with a logic so cold i've disregarded what i was now that i'm older and i know much more than i did back then but the more i learn the more i can't understand and i've become content with this life that i lead where i drink to much and don't believe in much of anything and i lie to myself and say "it's for the best." we're moving forward, but holding ourselves back and we're waiting on something that will never come

      Don't Look Back in Anger  Slip inside the eye of your mind Don't you know you might find A better place to play You said that you'd once never been All the things that you've seen Will slowly fade away   So I start the revolution from my bed Cos you said the brains I have went to my head Step outside the summertime's in bloom Stand up beside the fireplace Take that look from off your face You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out   So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by  Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I hear you say   Take me to the place where you go  Where nobody knows if it's night or day Please don't put your life in the hands  Of a Rock n Roll band  Who'll throw it all away   So I start the revolution from my bed Cos you said the brains I have went to my head Step outside the summertime's in bloom Stand up beside the fireplace Take that look from off your face You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out  So Sally can wait, she knows its too late as we're walking on by  Her soul slides away, but don't look back in anger I hear you say   Don't look back in anger Don't look back in anger Don't look back in anger At least not today     Gonna watch the game tonight and chill. Panthers...........you better pull through. I love you all. Don't get too drive to drunk tonight. Be safe.

      Am I to blame again? It seems I always am. I'm starving for some sort of change in my life, maybe to feel whole again, or just get away from myself. Take a day off from everything or maybe gt some type of sanity. Not depressed, just lost and confused.   Other people's lives seem more interesting, cuz they ain't mine, other people's live just seem more interesting...........I'm fed up and I need to go, out of existance or just down the road, forever..........................  Love you all lots. I'm gonna keep my distance most likely.

      I was supposed to ask Katie and Annen about doing something tonight........ if you get this then call me.........pease.  Getting back into the Old Salem business at least for Saturday and then homework. Call if you want to hook it up. Oh, and Mikey lies on his xanga! Bad boy! Don't be scared.   would you stay for one night?  if i didn't come home?  the end of a big fight  doesn't matter anymore  the point in my midlife  situation stands  but hours pass like years  wish you were here  wish you were here  did i open an old wound?  is there something i should know?  if it's all ending so soon  how could i possibly let go?  comes to a head, this is high noon  the finale we have planned  but hours pass like years  i wish you were here  say the words so slow  say it without fear  you won't turn to go  you won't leave me here  the past is all we know  the memories are clear  i wish you were here  if i told you, were you listening?  did you know this from the start?  do the dates match exactly?  your plan when we would part?  if i won't wait for another year  i guess you'll break my heart  it's true  you already knew  so take this as a souvenir  remember me, i'm waiting here  disappointed, hanging on  stayed behind while you moved on  wish you were here  The Get Up Kids rock!

      Computer Apps....................once again............boring.........but anyways, I actually watched MTV last night and the new Outkast song is great! I feel sick every time I hear Yellowcard because they can't write their own music.....but oh well, it's alright too. I'm getting scared for some of the people who have xanga's under the name SCREAMFORME52!!!!!!!!!!! and they need to chill for a lil bit before they get in over their head. Nothing to say today, so, love you all and keep me in your prayers and maybe I will come around soon.    I know you'd like to think that your sh-t don't stank................

      To someone who knows who they are: I keep waiting and waiting and praying and hoping that one day I may return to feeling like myself and get my life back fully. At times I feel that is too much to ask and it probably is, but I really just don't know.  In a lot of ways I feel as if I have let you down. There was something so perfect, and it got raped away from you and I and everyone else and life as it is and as I know it, changed and I'm not quite sure where I stand in it.  I know me inevitably holding onto you was a way for me to maybe, just maybe, keep a false security of being able to find my way back into myself and the light. You are a dear friend to me, and I fear that we will grow apart and sometimes feel miserable about how much of an inadequate person I have been to you and had such a negative influence in your life at times.  Everything happens for a reason, and I hope that you won't give up on me. Through every dark and rainy night there is always a sunshine and rainbow after the storm, and it gets sooo hard to wait and maybe get it. You have really taught me to do things for myself, which is why I am now doing what I am doing, and a lot of other things about life. I love you very much and I know that you know that. Please be patient and try and not let me go, dear friend.   "Piano Song"  Old friend, I hear you I know just how you feel I've been in your shoes before  I've seen your worries, And I can understand everything you going through  And I believe in you Your time is coming Don't give up tonight There's a life ahead Your time is coming Don't let go tonight My friend, I've listened Things only can improve You have all the time in the world So keep on fighting, And never let them say there's anything that you can't do Cause I believe in you Your time is coming Don't give up tonight There's a life ahead Your time is coming Don't let go tonight  I watched as you sat with a cigarette in your hand, holding a drink in the other, Trying to drown all your pain: And I believe in you Your time is coming Don't give up tonight There's a life ahead Your time is coming Don't let go tonight Old friend, you'll realize, Good things are worth the wait Enjoy the times that you have You'll see a new day, When darkness fades again, And the sun can rise to shine And I believe in you Your time is coming Don't give up tonight There's a life ahead Your time is coming Don't let go tonight.   Same old same old here. I saw Jon last night. We went and chilled out for a while before he had to go home to Florida. I had a good time. School, then work, then homework, maybe online tonight..........who knows.  P.S. : Remember that each day is a gift and our purpose for being on this earth is to give of ourselves to other people and try to love unconditionally. This world will one day fade away, as will everyone, so just try to remember to leave something good behind.

      I'm wanting to get out. It eats at me everyday and I can't control it. It rapes everything away from me and I am tired of fighting for my sanity. I love you all very much.  I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain  Just to be with the one he loves  How many times has he broken that promise  It has never been done  I've never climbed the highest mountain  But I walked the hill of Calvary   Just to be with you,I'd do anything  There's not price I would not pay  Just to be with you, I'd give anything  I would give my life away   I've heard it said that a man would swim the ocean  Just to be with the one he loves  How many times has he broken that promise  It can never be done  I've never swam the deepest ocean  But I walked upon the raging sea   Just to be with you,I'd do anything  There's not price I would not pay  Just to be with you, I'd give anything  I would give my life away   I know that you don't understand the fullness of My love  How I died upon the cross for your sins  And I know you don't realize how much that I gave you  But I promise, I would do it all again   Just to be with you, I did everything  There's not price I did not pay  Just to be with you, I gave everything  Yes, I gave my life away

      All this school and then work and homework is gonna beat me down eventually.  I'm gonna be gone most of the weekend at this youth event with Ardmore, which should be fun.  I'm kind of feeling like I'm floating along right now and I'm desperately hoping to feel like myself again.  I can't meet  Losing sleep over this  No I can't  And now I cannot stop pacing  Give me a few hours  I'll have this all sorted out  If my mind would just stop racing   Cause I cannot stand still  I can be this unsturdy  This cannot be happening   This is over my head  But underneath my feet  Cause by tomoroow morning I'll have this thing beat  And everything will be back to the way that it was  I wish that it was just that easy   Cause I'm waiting for tonight  Been waiting for tomoroow  I'm somewhere in between  What is real  Just a dream  What is real  Just a dream  What is real  Just a dream   Would you catch me if I fall out of what I fell in  Dont be surprised if I collapse down at your feet again  I don't want to run away from this  I know that I just don't need this   Cause I cannot stand still  I can be this unsturdy  This cannot be happening   Cause I'm waiting for tonight  Been waiting for tomorrow  And I'm somewhere in between  What is real  Just a dream  What is real  Just a dream  What is real  Just a dream  What is real just a dream   And you can't see when all your dreams are coming true.................

      I finally got my bloodwork done today so I hope that we can get all of this stuff sorted out pretty soon. I miss me some Jesus and feel a million miles away from any of that. I miss Ashley too, but maybe we will be close friends one of these days. It's so hard to see her because she is so busy. Work is pretty chill. All these kids are pretty nuts and some of them listen, so I will just stick it out and keep on trucking.  The more and more I go through life and truly look at things, I wonder where the world is going and what my purpose in it is. I have always have this gut feeling that something big is gonna happen in my life and I just don't know what it is right now. I have always had this feeling that I'm gonna die for something I believe in, which feels odd feeling this way.  I love you all and hear is a nifty song for all of you:  see all those people on the ground wasting time i try to hold it all inside but just for tonight the top of the world sitting here wishing the things I've become that something is missing maybe I... but what do I know   and now it seems that i have found nothing at all I want to hear your voice out loud slow it down without it all I'm choking on nothing it's clear in my head and I'm screaming for something knowing nothing is better than knowing at all

      I'm hoping that work will go very well today and that these kids aren't too crazy. I had a very......different weekend and looking forward to getting my bloodwork done tomorrow and getting all of this stuff sorted out. I feel bad of having such a bad influence on people I know because of me going nuts inside. I need to get all of my crap sorted out and then try to repatch some roads with certain people that I miss very dearly. I love you all. Pray for me.

      Today was a very beautiful cool spring day. I hooked it up and went to an Irish Festival at Wake Forest and slept a lil bit and did some homework. I'm confused in life right now and kind of lost so if you know the way, please make sure to tell me.  Psalm 69  1 Save me, O God,  for the waters have come up to my neck.  2 I sink in the miry depths,  where there is no foothold.  I have come into the deep waters;  the floods engulf me.  3 I am worn out calling for help;  my throat is parched.  My eyes fail,  looking for my God.  4 Those who hate me without reason  outnumber the hairs of my head;  many are my enemies without cause,  those who seek to destroy me.  I am forced to restore  what I did not steal.   5 You know my folly, O God;  my guilt is not hidden from you.   6 May those who hope in you  not be disgraced because of me,  O Lord, the LORD Almighty;  may those who seek you  not be put to shame because of me,  O God of Israel.  7 For I endure scorn for your sake,  and shame covers my face.  8 I am a stranger to my brothers,  an alien to my own mother's sons;  9 for zeal for your house consumes me,  and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.  10 When I weep and fast,  I must endure scorn;  11 when I put on sackcloth,  people make sport of me.  12 Those who sit at the gate mock me,  and I am the song of the drunkards.   13 But I pray to you, O LORD ,  in the time of your favor;  in your great love, O God,  answer me with your sure salvation.  14 Rescue me from the mire,  do not let me sink;  deliver me from those who hate me,  from the deep waters.  15 Do not let the floodwaters engulf me  or the depths swallow me up  or the pit close its mouth over me.  16 Answer me, O LORD , out of the goodness of your love;  in your great mercy turn to me.  17 Do not hide your face from your servant;  answer me quickly, for I am in trouble.  18 Come near and rescue me;  redeem me because of my foes.   19 You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed;  all my enemies are before you.  20 Scorn has broken my heart  and has left me helpless;  I looked for sympathy, but there was none,  for comforters, but I found none.  21 They put gall in my food  and gave me vinegar for my thirst.   22 May the table set before them become a snare;  may it become retribution and [1] a trap.  23 May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see,  and their backs be bent forever.  24 Pour out your wrath on them;  let your fierce anger overtake them.  25 May their place be deserted;  let there be no one to dwell in their tents.  26 For they persecute those you wound  and talk about the pain of those you hurt.  27 Charge them with crime upon crime;  do not let them share in your salvation.  28 May they be blotted out of the book of life  and not be listed with the righteous.   29 I am in pain and distress;  may your salvation, O God, protect me.   30 I will praise God's name in song  and glorify him with thanksgiving.  31 This will please the LORD more than an ox,  more than a bull with its horns and hoofs.  32 The poor will see and be glad-  you who seek God, may your hearts live!  33 The LORD hears the needy  and does not despise his captive people.   34 Let heaven and earth praise him,  the seas and all that move in them,  35 for God will save Zion  and rebuild the cities of Judah.  Then people will settle there and possess it;  36 the children of his servants will inherit it,  and those who love his name will dwell there.    I love you all and this is a good passage to read. Hit up the WORD with some B-I-B-L-E.

      Okay, I really really wanted to write something depressing and be all pissed off about stupid crap but I'm not gonna do that. I feel frustrated about a lot of things in my life right now and how everything is so unpredictable and how Zack keeps trying to erase this entry! I finally got to talk to Ashley last night, which was awesome. I just hope that we can become really close again. I just don't know what she wants yet. It's all good though. I know that everything works out for the best so I will just have to wait and see. I love you all very much and call me if you want to do something.

      Yesterday was one of the best and worst days of my life. I finally have a job I will enjoy doing. I'm glad about this daycare business. I totally bottomed out yesterday and I had to get some stuff sorted out with that but other than that I'm doing pretty good. Keeping a smile up as much as I can and praying that it will all be alright. I'm in Computer Apps. right now, bored and just thinking a lot. I do that too much, but I learn a lot. I miss you all very much (well.......most of you) and hit me up some time.

      Okay, I think I am getting a hint on how it feels to be a female. All these mood swings and such are killing me. It's all supposed to be worked out in like 2 to 4 days. It would be nice to have anyone who believed what I said about my problems. It would be nice to live like a normal person or have people who wouldn't talk crap behind my back. I'm not gonna be all pissed off at anyone though. I love you all and I forgive you and hope that you forgive me for my stupid crap as well. Don't worry if I keep my distance, I probably need it. Love you all.......... pray for me.   Oh and my grades in skool are great now. A's and B's like it was in elementary school.   You can tell us that it isn't serious And you can tell us that you'll do it right You can tell us that you've got it all worked out You can tell us that it's all for us But we know you're lying through your teeth You can tell us that it's for security And you can tell us it's for our own good You can tell us that we wouldn't understand, and you can hide behind your practiced grin But we know you're lying through your teeth You will bare the brunt of liability It will be a stone around your neck, drowning you in irresponsibility, underneath the weight of your regret You can sell our secrets for your benefit You can toss our bodies in the ground You can ship our children off to battlefields You can wipe the blood from both your hands You can tell us that it's indisputable, as you throw away the evidence But, we know you're lying through your teeth You will bare the brunt of liability It will be a stone around your neck, drowning you in irresponsibility, underneath the weight of your regret.  The Juliana Theory rocks my socks off.

      You'll bruise their hearts, child You'll live their lives? You'll fill their shoes, child? You'll still be right? You'll speak your words, child You're still naive You'll tell your lies, child They'll still believe All you've ever said about them, it was never right Has all you've learned here been forgotten? You're the perfect light? Don't strain your head, child, thinking for them Don't place the blame, child Your time will come All you've ever thought about them, it was never right Your "open mind" is sealed and settled, locked and bolted tight All you've lived is moments in a fraction of their lives It's sad you never notice when the stick is in your eye You'll throw your stones, child You'll never bleed? All you've ever said about them, it was never right And all you've ever thought about them, it was never right The bleeding hearts and artists painted meanings in their songs And all the little children lost their minds and sang along All that you said wasn't true.    Still no computer. I'm chilling, miss all you guys very much. Gimme a call. love ya lots.

      Maybe the things that no one wants to say or face are the things that could help things the most. I hope people will forgive me and I can get on with everything. Lack of communication kills things and I know that I am never gonna be in a utopia and that you have to play with the cards that life gives you, and I am getting to where i am glad to work with it at points.

      "Empty Apartment"  Call me out You stayed inside One you love Is where you hide Shot me down as I flew by Crash and burn I think sometimes you forget where the heart is  Answer no to these questions Let her go, learn a lesson It's not me, you're not listening now Can't you see something's missing? You forget where the heart is  Take you away from that empty apartment You stay and forget where the heart is  Someday if ever you love me you'd say it's okay  Waking up from this nightmare How's your life, what's it like there? Is it all what you want it to be? Does it hurt when you think about me? And how broken my heart is  Take you away from that empty apartment You stay and forget where the heart is Someday if ever you love me you'd say it's okay  It's okay to be angry and never let go It only gets harder the more that you know When you get lonely if no one's around  You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down We came together but you left alone  And I know how it feels to walk out on your own Maybe someday I will see you again  And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend  Take you away from that empty apartment You stay and forget where the heart is  Someday if ever you love me you'd say its okay It's okay It's okay   Nothing new going on. Love yahs.

      People are really dissappointing me lately. I don't know who my true human friends are outside of my family anymore. It's soooo confusing with people and their relationships and dating people and being caught inbetween what is real and just a dream. Feeling second best and being the one to fall back on if original plans don't go through, I just want a place to put a foot on and be steady.

      Wow, I am realizing more and more how much we need Jesus Christ in everything. He gave us everything and he does everything for us and we deserve none of it. The seen is all temporary but the unseen is forever. Keep your hearts open and this world sucks. always remember that. Never conform to the ways of this world, cuz this world sucks.  Eph. 6:12  Read This

      My doctor's visit was okay. I am told that most likely I will have to deal with all of my crazy mental crap for a long time, hopefully not my whole life, but who knows. I am starting to view it as something that I have to work past and a challenge to fight and keep fighting and will in turn make me stronger. I also notice myself starting to like a friend of mine, but I don't know what is up with that. I still have too many emotional attachments already and I don't want to mess up another friendship. Oh well, I will probably wait it out and be single and keep things on a strictly friends kinda level. Love you all very much.....................and I am forced to stop this entry for more school work....

      I'm listening to a lot of music and going back to some of the roots of music and finding a home in them. My Mikey is leaving soon for South Africa and another of my friends passed away a couple of days ago. I get older, and people are leaving and doing there own thing and people are passing away, and although I do miss them and have good memories from it and loved those times, I am finally getting to a place where I am not afraid of "being alone". I hope that I will fully get out of my hole and stay out of it. I am starting to enjoy my work more and more and more and relearning to ignore stupid stuff that would normally piss me off and try to look past that and do everything in love. I love you all.

      I got rice cookin' in the microwave  Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave  And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey  I'm doin' alright   Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup  I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth  It's neither drink nor drug induced, no  I'm just doin' alright   And it's a great day to be alive  I know the sun's still shinin'  When I close my eyes  There's some hard times in the neighborhood  But why can't everyday be just this good   It's been 15 years since I left home  And said good luck to every seed I'd sown  gave it my best and then I left it alone  I hope they're doin' alright   Now I look in teh mirror and what do I see  A lone wolf there starin' back at me  Long in the tooth but harmless as can be  Lord I guess he's doin' alright   And it's a great day to be alive  I know the sun's still shinin'  When I close my eyes  There's some hard times in the neighborhood  But why can't everyday be just this good   Sometimes it lonely, sometimes it's only me  And the shadows that fill this room  Sometimes I'm fallin', desperately callin'  Howlin' at the moon, ah-ooh   Well I might go get me a new tattoo  Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise  Might even grow me a Fu Man Chu   And it's a great day to be alive  I know the sun's still shinin'  When I close my eyes  There's some hard times in the neighborhood  But why can't everyday be just this good   It's a great day to be alive  I know the sun's still shinin'  When I close my eyes  There's some hard times in the neighborhood  But why can't everyday be just this good   Yeah.....I'm starting to listen to country and some older stuff now. It is def. a great day to be alive. I don't have too much to say, other than keep your head up and keep dreaming and don't listen to anyone that trys to tell you to stop.  We idolize the people that stood out of the line and are told to get back into it if we do the same.

Almost a year has passed and I am desperately hoping and praying for a recovery to its fullest and to feel like myself again. I am learning that things will sometimes take time and I hope that things do not pass me by too much and that people will wait for me. Work is fun most of the time. It has definetly been a source of birth control if i ever get any urges. lol. It just ruins my plans! Gosh!   Question of the Day?   Whats yo man got ta do with me?

      So far it's looking like it is gonna be a great summer. I am gonna go on a missions trip this summer helping the Latino peoples, which will be a unique experience. I love you all very much.   Going Through The Motions   Only you can start this fire in my heart, set me a blaze tonite Cold no longer One day my fight will be over, but for now I'm looking straight ahead And its all for you So i'll let you rise, i'll let you rise in these bones Our eyes have grown dim finding no rest in ourselves Renew us o' lord, light the fire within Burn, renew this heart Burn, and rise from these ashes Burn the fire within Burn rise up from these ashes Burn, and cleanse these bones Burn, renew my heart cause i'll praise you Burn until the day that you will return Nothing more than to see through your eyes I want nothing else but to see through your eyes Burn in my heart Take my heart, set me free, light my fire   Beloved has gotten pretty big, which is kind of odd that they are from K-Vegas. They have always had it though.

      Oh yes, I found two awesome songs!!!! The Beatles, baby!!!!   Let It Be   When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. And in my hour of darkness She is standing right in front of me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. Let it be, let it be. Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.  And when the broken hearted people Living in the world agree, There will be an answer, let it be. For though they may be parted there is Still a chance that they will see There will be an answer, let it be. Let it be, let it be. Yeah There will be an answer, let it be.  And when the night is cloudy, There is still a light that shines on me, Shine on until tomorrow, let it be. I wake up to the sound of music Mother Mary comes to me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. Let it be, let it be. There will be an answer, let it be. Let it be, let it be, Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.   Imagine   Imagine there's no heaven, It's easy if you try, No hell below us, Above us only sky, Imagine all the people living for today...  Imagine there's no countries, It isnt hard to do, Nothing to kill or die for, No religion too, Imagine all the people living life in peace...  Imagine no possesions, I wonder if you can, No need for greed or hunger, A brotherhood of man, Imagine all the people Sharing all the world...  You may say Im a dreamer, but Im not the only one, I hope some day you'll join us, And the world will live as one.

      I finally got my medicine ish sorted out and I am feeling quite well and hopefully it will stay that way. I have only 2 more days left of school and am looking forward to working at my job this summer. Probably skate for a lot of the summer and chill with some homies. I hope to go see Katie at least more than once this summer up at camp, which is likely because I can just hit up rides from Annen, Preston or my parents. I don't have the internet for a while so I will probably post few and far between this summer. Much love for you all!!!!!

      I have been feeling really crappy recently. All of my friends are having problems and are being pains about a lot of things. I can't really complain because I have been doing it too. I have the perfect job this summer and things how I want them, excluding my car/driving issues but I feel so miserable. I am going to the doctor for it today or tomorrow, which means me having to switch my ish out  (ONCE AGAIN!!!)  so that maybe I can get my ish straightened out!!!! Well, last night was awesome. I went out with Annenenenenenenenenen and we had a lotta fun. We got all wet from playing in the water in downtown Winston and it relieved a lot of stress from me. It was one of the best times that I have had in a while.  I'm peacing out, Much love. Pray for me.  "I Will Play My Game Beneath the Spin Light"  The time has come for colds and overcoats.  We're quiet on the ride,  we're all just waiting to get home.  Another week away, my greatest fear.  I need the smell of summer,  I need its noises in my ears.  If looks could really kill,  then my profession would staring.  Please know we do this cause we care  and not for the thrill.  Collect calls to home  to tell them that I realize  that everyone who lives will someday die  and die alone.   And we won't let you in.  Though we're down and out.  We won't let you in. You win.   I wrote more postcards than hooks.  I read more maps than books.  Feel like every chance to leave  is another chance I should have took.  Every minute is a mile.  I've never felt so hollow.  I'm an old abandoned church with broken pews  and empty aisles.  My secrets for a buck.  Watch me as I cut myself wide open  on this stage. Yes, I am paid  to spill my guts. I won't see home till spring. Oh, I would kill for the Atlantic,  but I am paid to make girls panic  while I sing.   And we won't let you in.  Though we're down and out.  We won't let you in.  And we won't let you in.  We don't want what isn't ours.  We won't let you in.  You win.   And the coastline is quiet.  While we're quietly losing control.  Yes, we're silent but sure  we inventened the cure  that will wash out my memories of her.  "The harpoon is loaded. The cage is lowered.  The water is red."  Like you.

      Okay, lots of stuff going on here. I finally got to see my dearest Katie and Preston on Sunday and school is fixing to be out soon. I also am trying to sort through a lot of things in my head right now. I am sorting through my depression ish as well as trying to figure out who I am and certain relationships that I have with people. It is hard when you love someone but they make choices that you cannot accept.

      'Twas a great weekend I did indeed had and I am starting to feel more and more like myself everyday. I feel kind of lost because I dunno where I am going to be in my life but I know everything is gonna be taken care of. I gotta stop planning stuff out. I think me having my wreck was a reminder from God that I gotta trust Him with everything and not to try to fall back on anything but Him. I also am looking at if how I view things and people in the past were accurately. If situations and relationships were healthy in an overall tone or not and I feel that i made things out to be things that they weren't. I am also getting pressured into getting into this dating business by myself with mixed emotions, and friends and stress and my sister telling me to move on from the last "loser" I was seeing. Ugh. I dunno. I just don't really wanna deal with anyone's crap and I notice myself falling for people and I wanna not screw up friendships that I already have. Oh well, just whatev. I need to get some things talked through with some of my peeps at school but unfortunately I gotta go to the doctor with my eye, which by the way I hope will get better. Well, I am tired and just in a blah kinda monetone melancholy mood sore as crap still but......to bed I must go.    Oh yes, thank you to all of you who have made a difference in my life. you are very dear to me and although I know I am an ackward person at times and a bitty, thanks for all of your support and putting up with me through all my sillyness and sadness and mostly sadness and me fighting myself this past year. I love you all, yes even those of you who piss me off, so don't think otherwise. lol.    MUCH LOVE!!!!

      Wow what a week! Kids having nervous breakdowns at work, almost getting in a million head on collisions on Wednesday and then totaling my car and leaving myself in not too great of a condition either. It was Ledford day at the ER. I walk into the ER and I see Jamie and Bobbie back there because Bobbie got his nose broken in a fight. He got cheap-shotted and he looks horrible. And I am just chilling, and then my beautifulist Amanda comes in there looking very very upset with some ish with her grandpa and probably seeing me with blood all over my neck and two other people from our school didn't help.  I got out pretty good considering how fast I got hit and especially since it was in my driver's side door. I am sooooo freaking sore and it isn't gonna get any better anytime soon. lol. Ah well. I got some glass in my eye and an abrasion on it and something is messed up with my cornia (however you spell that). If I didn't go to the hospital last night I probably would have went blind on it, as I am told, but it is getting better so hopefully I won't have to have any more surgery on it. Summer is getting near again and I am gonna miss not being able to work until I am better. I have no new emotional drama to say and my eye hurts, so I'm off to bed.

      Wow, my life is extremely mixed up. I am realizing how poor of an example I am in being a child of God and it eats me up how inadequate I am and where and how I wanna be and I wonder if I can be the person I wanna be. All these people that I am close to are leaving me in miles or in hearts so I am in a scary situation wondering what is gonna happen. I am not scared but just kind of just wanna let whatever is gonna happen happen and not really care but hey, whatever. I notice I am starting to fall for this girl I am really awesome friends with but I am so screwed up over losing a friend in my whole day to day issues and they deal with my crap everyday, but I dunno. Girls are confusing me to death right now and there are a million on my mind and two that matter to me. I am ready for summer for real though. I wanna just get lost somewhere and just go skate and go work. That would rock so freaking hard.     Sing like no one is listening

      Okay, so this past week I went on a mission trip and it really forced me to look at how much filth is in this world and how fast it is all dying. I want to be a less selfish person and try and take the things from this world away from me. I have no idea what I am doing next fall but I am starting not to care. I am but a mist and I am gonna prepare for it but not stress on it. I met a bunch of awesome people this week and have started to get on fire in my life again.     This world has nothing for me and this world has everything.

      Wow, my mind is really blown. I have found out that many many other people dwell in the same sadness and fear that I go through. Life being such an existential/on my own thing was something I think that as we grow up people begin to feel it and it burns so hard. I am fighting to find a balance on being dependant of other people. That is one of the reasons things probably screwed up with Ashley. I want and something keeps telling me to keep talking to Maggie but I am so heartbroken over last night. She seemed all like "WTF! That's really strange that you are calling me". I don't know. I was hoping to find someone that I knew was a genuine person and find some companionship in. Girls seem to misread me though. I do absolutely not want to get into another dating/relationship thing for a long long time. I think that when I was with Ashley it was what I needed at that time and she helped me get through the roughest part of my life that I have faced, but looking back and looking around me I see how much I just need to take it easy and take care of myself. I guess maybe taking whatever Maggie said however I took it really screwed me up in the head. I had a great time with Katie and Annen tonight and it is so odd to see Annen and realize that an excellent friend is going away, as are almost everyone I trust.  &nbsp;  Sometimes we have to take a shot in the dark to find the light. We must go our own ways and do our own things and what is meant to be will&nbsp; be. The existence of thoughts of what might have been and what actually is will mostly divert and slow down the what is.&nbsp; I just hope I keep my heart how it is and keep on trucking. I love you all and hopefully I will look back and be grateful for everything. Glad for the bad times that make me stronger, glad for the mistakes that show me the way and glad for a Savior and best friend who eases this sickness in my body.

       Why does Change always scare me? I sometimes wish that I could control things but other times I am glad that life is such an existential journey.     &nbsp;  You ask me if I will miss you when you are gone and I think about it everyday and it hurts so bad. You are the best friend that anyone could have and my life&nbsp;is all spinning in directions that I haven't felt before.    &nbsp;  I finally found a way to contact Maggie and I am soooo scared. I want for us to be good friends but I remember that I used to be totally in love with her and don't want for that to happen while I am so young.

      Shit        Old friend, I hear you I know just how you feel I've been in your shoes before  I've seen your worries, And I can understand everything you going through  And I believe in you Your time is coming Don't give up tonight There's a life ahead Your time is coming Don't let go tonight My friend, I've listened Things only can improve You have all the time in the world So keep on fighting, And never let them say there's anything that you can't do Cause I believe in you Your time is coming Don't give up tonight There's a life ahead Your time is coming Don't let go tonight  I watched as you sat with a cigarette in your hand, holding a drink in the other, Trying to drown all your pain: And I believe in you Your time is coming Don't give up tonight There's a life ahead Your time is coming Don't let go tonight Old friend, you'll realize, Good things are worth the wait Enjoy the times that you have You'll see a new day, When darkness fades again, And the sun can rise to shine And I believe in you Your time is coming Don't give up tonight There's a life ahead Your time is coming Don't let go tonight.       I am such a lazy piece and don't ever post anymore because you guys never get online to talk to me and it makes me very sad. Not really. I'm such a dookie head.
