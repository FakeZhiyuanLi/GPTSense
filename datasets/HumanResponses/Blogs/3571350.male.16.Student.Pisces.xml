      Hey people. I stopped writing because I was getting criticized from the comments of people that I don't get out much and that I need to? Hello! I go out every day to hang out with my friends. Plus thanks Maddy for caring for me :) Don't worry i'd never hurt or kill myself i'm not that kind of person. Well i'm going to update you on everything that has happened so far. Well last week I had my first session of therapy with my therapist Lise. She's really ice and stuff. It was just about getting information and stuff and why I was there and I just started crying about my situation. I'm going back next friday. Also tennis has been on television about 10 hours! Plus i've been goin to the movies with my friends last week and some parts of this week. I'm still in a grumpy and shitty mood with my parents. They HAVE stopped fighting but I just don't like 'em. They way they treat me the way they expect me to treat them like i'm suppose to worship them when they come in the room and give my seat to them every time and change the channel every time like they own my soul. I'm not in a very let's say happy mood. It is mostly bored and not very exciting about much because I know it will end in sadness. Is that depression? I don't think I'm depressed i'm mostly mad than sad. Plus all my MADNESS is inside and how dare I let it go in the house or outside because that would be embarrasing and letting my parents down and that's a SIN in this house. oooo. Also my mom told me my dad was healed of athritis. You can believe what you want but I BELIEVE in miracles since I'm roman catholic. His knuckles were soo sore and swelling really big but i think she said two years ago he went to the Virgin Mary's statue or vigil? and prayed and asked to be healed of it. Then when he came home he took his pills for it but it just made him even more sick so he decided to stop taking them and after like a week or 3 days it was completely gone. Again believe whatever you want but it was a miracle and arthritis like his was incurable and it was gone. Also I'm not really full of energy anymore. What should I do and I feel fat when other people say I'm not. Im 6'0 and about 155-160 lbs. Well I hope I got you up to date!

      It's Monday. I have been stressed out about the issue in my previous post. But now I just will leave him alone. I hope he grows up and sees that fun doesn't need to have pot included. Anywho,My brother is gone for the night so his computer is mine muahaha :p I'll be up laaaate with the computer. Especially to listen to my favourite radio show Last Call on 580 CFRA at midnight. I like talk radio more than just music all the time. I like hearing people talking etc.. and them being live. I call in every week but my parents don't know because it's a 1-800 number and i have been listening to it since it started which was i think october or november. I can hardly sleep with no radio softly on so I don't think so I sleep :) Also my brother accidently deleted everything of mine AND his. so all of my files are gone and my bookmarks are gone but thankfully i remembered all of them. Today has been a stressful but in the end it's a good one. BYE

      I just found out my brother smokes pot. it was in one of his messages that he was smoking. I am just soo out of energy with this situation. And he's lying about that he's going to help his friend colin to install norton but he's actually smoking. WHY ME? Seriously. My life is now hell and my family is screwed up. Why me and why does it have to happen to me people? I don't know what to do right now. I'll maybe tell my parents tomorrow morning as they're sleeping right now and be pissed at me for waking them up. That's the big thing about my day. HELP

      Today was a day of relaxtion for me even though my parents fought for a period IN FRONT OF ME. Joy joy joy but they thankfully stopped and are getting along :) They just go on and off on with it. But they're off it now. But other than that it was a good day. I watched some television all sports. I really like watching sports today i watched EURO 2004!!! It was the first day and i've decided to get into it this year and my favourite teams are England,France,Portugal and Italy but my #1 team is england! I have alot of online friends from england so they're happy i'm in with them in euro 2004. In case you didn't know euro 2004 is a soccer event in portugal hosting the top soccer nations. I luckily get it every day but a down side to it is that I miss Wimbledon tennis coverage for it, ups and downs! Anywho my brother took the computer for the night in which i am extremely mad about so i'm on the downstairs computer where my parents are watching television and i would think they could easily see what i'm writing but thankfully they haven't. Nothing much on television tonight so i'll most likely go to bed early and wake up and watch the canadian grand prix. GOOD NIGHT EVERYONE!

      It's Friday! Today I watched Ronald Reagan's funeral is was really sad watching it i can just imagine how people close to him or people who were alive or remembered him when he was president. Anywho, my dad is clueless about computer/music but i don't blame him he's hardly on the computer anyways. he was asking if the song i was playing was skipping since i put it on repeat for 13 times since i liked it soo much. My parents did groceries today. Still didn't get my list right but i'll deal with since they got me stuff i like. I hope i sleep well tonight and wake up in time for F1 Canadian grand prix qualifying. I just LOVE Formula1 racing. It's my favourite kind of car racing and I hope rubens barichello can show a good performance this year and knock off michael shumacher who just keeps winning everything in sight. Also track and field is on. The Golden League Oslo track and field is on CBC tomorrow at 5 i hope i don't forget about it. My favourite event is pole vault or 800 metres. I don't know if Perdita is competing in it but I sure hope so. Well as you should've noticed not much else to type and i'm still in a good mood. Bye for tonight :D

      Today is a cool day about 60f(18 celcius) with some cold breeze. My parents stopped fighting :)I don't know how but they did. I'm all happy now I hope whoever is reading this is too. I've been on the computer most of the day and watched coronation street today because it's one of my favourite shows. It's a british soap opera that is 30 mins long and i haven't missed an episode since last winter when I got into it. We ordered out for supper. I had my favourite food which is hamburgers :) the rest of my family had an all dressed pizza  yuuck! I especially hate the peppers on there. The only way i'll eat a pizza is with cheese nothing else on it. Someone said i was depressed in the comments but i don't feel depressed. I'm not always mad or sad it's just that my mood can go from mad-happy in a minute but when i'm mad i go almost all out. Is that a teenager thing or is it just me? Today and last night I watched the trailer of the movie Saved! I wanna see that movie so much now. It's about a teenager who was at the top of the popular list at her catholic high school but got pregnant etc. and had to deal with a lot of stuff. It seems like a good movie and it's usually funny. Well it's been a boring but pleasant day for me. Hope i keep up the happiness :)

      My parents are fighting again. I don't know if you classify my mom not talking to my dad fighting but I DO. Then I comment at it and  my asshole of a dad says  "WAS I TALKING TO YOU?!!  Of course i said no because he wasn't. Wow is my life screwed up even though it might not look like it outside the house of dumbasses. I SWEAR they fight once a month or once every two months. Plus its pointless because usually it's my mom who thinks my dad is looking at another woman. I reeeeally doubt that he has or she has caught him in my eyes i think she does it on purpose for some strange and assholeish reason. I'm again listening to avril lavigne's new cd which rox but my mom told me to close the door even though ITS NOT LOUD  but it is now  ;):p just to annoy them and block them out of my life for 40 minutes or until my brother comes home probably wasted. I don't know what a drunk person smells like because i of course don't smell my brother because he would beat me up or just yell at me or give me a "what the fuck is wrong with you" look(he's 20). I just wish the fighting would stop and they actually talk about it without my dad being pushed away from my mom who acts like a bitch when she's a bitch(don't worry if the last few words didn't make sense):p. Tomorrow or the rest of tonight better get better or i will be soo mad i won't give a FUCK what they say or do. Bye for now!

      I am in an average mood of happiness and tiredness and boredness. It's been raining almost all day and we've had glimpses of sun and im in the basement where theres a WIDE SCREEN TV. It's funny how the weather can affect your mood because if it's sunny your up-beat and happy but when it rains your tired and bored usually napping like my parents are right now. I never nap. I always have something to write or watch or do. Btw is it just old people(theyre about 50 and im 16) that take naps 4 in the afternoon when it's raining? Kevin visited my blogsite :)+He thinks im cool! Plus he's cool to. Hollywood Squares is on. Charo is sometimes scary and funny. shes like YES YES YES. Then im saying calm down for crying out loud! You think the jokes are scripted? Most of them aren't even close to being funny. Melissa Peterman is the funniest i think and if you don't know she's from wb's-Reba. Wilson Philips are on On Air with ryan seacrest. theyre actually good. well I just hope my parents make supper or ill go to the store and buy some doritos. They are my favourite kind of chips! I wuv my dog. she's a black labrador and her name is sacha and she's 11 years old. I love her to soo much. I hope she doesn't pass away soon i will be depressed for so long when she does. Well gonna stop and ill most likely be back writing tonight :)

      Right now I'm in a little better mood than before. I ate lets say a little more than some crutons(the things you put in salads that are crunchy but really good alone) and my mom didnt complain. What a relief there for me. I started reading someone else's blog who is an assistant manager at a strip club. Its funny/weird at the same time. And NO IM NOT FREAKIN MASTURBATING. Im not a sick pig(sorry for any1 who's offended for some reason). Its still hot here but i guess it calmed down a bit. By the way im a member of a tennis message board in which i have 11,500 posts they are mostly caused by my boredom and i have nothing else to do. I play two fantasy games that are the MOLE and SURVIVOR. Im doing good in both of them but i really like the survivor one better because it involves alot of strategy and paranoia in which i find interesting. Im in the final 7 in survivor and ive survived 3 eliminations in the mole game. My brother is gone to work until who knows when so im on his windows xp computer,25 inch screen which is the sweetest computer you may ever see. My brother is an okay person. I sometimes really hate him and sometimes i say he's okay. But I think he's been secretely smoking pot in his room. I just don't know what to say most of the times and I cant believe my parents dont know the smell. I KNOW THE SMELL AND I HAVE NEVER SMOKED POT which just says how much more i know than them. My parents have caught him alot but i think they've just given up which is really really really stupid of them. Also Im going to therapy to a councillor who doesnt swear alot like my past one did. The first time i heard of threapy was only weird and stupid and crazy people go to it but I guess I was extremely wrong. It's just to gather and share your thoughts with a stranger if that sounds right or correct in any way? Well theres nothing on tv tonight except the first season of the mole on the network for games. So dont be surprised if i show up again writing here :D

      Today is really hot. it feels like 34 and the wind is crazy. Im sweating just sitting here. Im soo hungry but of course nothing really to eat. My parents expect me to do things they dont even do for me! When Im sleeping until 12pm sometimes noone cares as they just talk aloud and play music loudly and the tv like i dont even exist at that point. but just now my mom at 4.20pm asked me to turn the music down because my dad is trying to sleep. its fucking 4 in the afternoon and she expects me to put my life on HOLD for him to get a good rest. show some fucking damn respect woman! This life of mine is so screwed up. My only way out is listenin to my cd's and writing here. I hate most of the times being treated like crap  but when it comes around to them they expect me to be oh ok ill do anything for you master of all universe(if you didnt know, that was sarcasm for all u dumbass'). I think Im gonna get some doritos later since im hungry and i musn't touch their crutons or ill get screamed at.  Its freaking hot!

      Omg. My mom just asked me "Does that song seem depressing to you"(she was referring to knockin' on heaven's door in which i was listening to). What kind of question is that to ask your own child? It sends the message to me wut's wrong you weird person that is listening to this song. I hate when she asks questions that refer to depressing,mad,that's too loud or too sad. She is getting on my nerves people!!! Btw I just took a test How would you murder-  Weapons are not your thing. You would prefer to pummel your opponent to death with your fists and feet. You show a lot of Honor but some power still eludes you. I can give you this power, I can make you stronger, join me.  Become a Vampire!   I love taking quizzes. especially when I'm bored.

      Here's Knockin' On Heaven's Door by Avril Lavigne which inspired the title for my blog.   Momma take this badge off of me I can't use it anymore It's getting dark, too dark to see Feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door   Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door    Momma put my guns in the ground I can't shoot them anymore That long black cloud is coming down I Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door   Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  Yeah, yeah, yeah [4x]  this song is a soft and comforting song for me when I feel sad and feel like there's no hope etc.. I love it and hope you do to.

      Why do I get treated like shit one second and get treated like   NOTHING   ever happened later. I feel like I don't know what to do or say or act because of what my parents would say or do.  I HATE IT  I am NOW in the "phase" of not giving a shit about what anyone says,thinks about what/who I am or what I do. It really is making me mad at the moment. PLUS when i dont care about what anyone says or thinks they/he/she says what the hell is wrong with you? or they get mad right back at me for saying and doing what I feel like doing. Right noone I think only a couple people understand what I am going through right now and I thank them. If you're thinking they're my parents you are the most opposite of right you could ever be.

      Today I just found out my bestest friend in the whole world smokes pot and once had a cigarette. She never told me about it until now and I feel like I've lost some trust with her and stuff. She said almost 75% of the school does it in which i believe but I don't. After I knew it I felt weird and I hardly know why. The only reason is that >I

      I just watched this super show called&nbsp; The Days where a disfunctional Philly family is viewed through the outkast Carson Day who's fifteen. It's almost the same as my life and I can really relate to it. I hope I get new clothes that actually reflect who I am and what i've delt with. But no money for me. I want to lose weight since I have some fat in the stomach. Any suggestions other than giving up doritos in which i adore. The fourth week of July started with me waking up and turning on my brother's computer because he's gone camping, of course someone walks in(my dad) and says you're up early even though it's only nine. Then the privacy invasion starts because I actually thought I could have some time to myself on the computer without people coming in and out of the room and talking like they're speaking to someone three houses down. After that I read a book I haven't read in a while and it's more interesting now than ever and then I decided because I'm bored as hell to go out for a bike ride.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need more to my life and I need suggestions other than hangin out with people around here because there's only a little hang out group who are total losers and there's this other guy who has his own "rap group". I wish I could spend for time with carrie but she has stupid summer school. Anywho I'm gonna go and watch some television at midnight and pray that my so called family can leave me alone and actually sleep. BYE

      Hey people. I just found out that my school has uniforms. I do hate and have always hated uniforms since they're all not who I am and who I want to be. It's all blue and light black which is like country club sort of shit. This has made me soo mad as my friend too. Anyways i've played tennis again and I lost 6-3 7-6(1). My forehand is something I couldn't control which was nervewracking for me. Also the olympics starts in 29 days. I just can't wait! I have always had a passion for it and the events and the cities! Well not muc else to talk about bye

      My life is an emotional rollercoaster. My parents are fighting again!! It is tiring on me and my thoughts and my communication with them. They are acting really immature right now and not a very good example for me. To get away from it all i played tennis against the school wall which is a block away. It helped as I was just focused on playing and not my parents plus I guess you could call it in a way therapy but it doesn't feel like it. Why cant they just STOP THE FIGHTING and go to therapy like I am or just talk it out instead of screaming it out time and time again!! I can't say it enough i am sick and tired of it and I need to get away from this! The fighting is making stressed 24/7 and it needs to stop, someway somehow it needs to stop. On Another topic i love TLC :P I love trading spaces and alot of the shows on there even if my mom doesnt. She doesn't like anything I like which is okay since I want to be almost the opposite of her really. Gonna go now BYE

      Today I went to my therapist. We were talking about like what my thing is and stuff. It was really relaxing and I wasn't nervous or anything like I was last time which is always a good sign for me. I went out and played tennis today!! I won 6-4 6-3 and I really felt good about my game and myself out there. You know what I need? I need some sort of tan since the upper part of my legs are just plain white and it looks freaky because the bottom part of my leg is tanned! Anywho my parents still make me EXTREMELY MAD but my mom is soo cool now. My Dad is still the meanest guy in the house and I try not to talk to him since he's such an asshole. I hope carrie and I meet again since she's in summer school and has tons of homework. Maybe the Weekend since I'm not planning much! See ya later peeps + myself. I hope I continue to have a postitive attitude towards myself :) BYE

      Okay Hey. Im being more honest to people I find. I say what I feel like and I mean what I say. Plus ive been more honest to my friend paul. I just talked about the situation in my life and how I'm feeling about everything. I'm thinking better about myself like how I look and how I represent myself even though some people don't like how I look well this is me :D I want to see carrie :( She lives a town away so we have to "arrange" to meet each other and hang out. I love her to death!! By the way my two favourite reality shows started last night which are big brother and amazing race. I AM SO EXCITED I watch every episode. I hate people who are really cocky and think their all that especially on shows. I need to say this im relaxing more but it might be a stage :p Well i see my therapist against friday be sure of it i will tell you what happens since I am soo stressed and overwhelmed talking about my issues and I NEED to get it out there!! Also nothing to eat :( But there's cheerioos in which i hate with milk since it drags the taste out of it. Anywho BYE BYE FOR NOW! Maddy im sorry but are you a guy or a girl?

      It was soo weird seeing Canada 72nd on the list because of the greek alphabet. But I still liked the ceremonies and it was nice hearing the roar from the greek crowd. The Olympic Games will relax me mentally because they will distract me from any problems I have. I saw my therapist today. We just talked about the booklet I read "Coping with Stress" and it really heped me and I could relate to the symptoms it had in there. I love my therapist she is soo warm,comforting and understanding which is something I need in my life for someone to talk to me and for me to talk to them. My next appointment is September 7th at 11am. If any other NEW news pops up ill post/blog it here. GO CANADA in ATHENS!

      I just found out i'm gonna be getting tennis lessons in the fall starting in October. I have a lot of things to work on my tennis game. I have been playing for about three years. I love the sport. As long as the teach doesn't treat me like a baby i'll be fine. I'm so excited about it now but it's on saturdays so it will be frustrating. There was something I was going to talk about but I forgot! I guess I wanted to say that the olympics start in two days and I get full coverage. Anywho I hate hot weather when I'm sleeping but in the middle of the night it gets soo cold I was freezing. Well gonna go and i'll post again once I figure out what I wanted to say.

      Im finally able to login again after i've forgotten my password five times. Well im bored as always since there is no food. If there's no food there's no entertainment on the television. I've been in a better mood since i've taken the pills more regularly plus my therapy. I've been reading a little book coping with stress that my therapist gave to me. I'm not even halfway done cause I try to get away from reading since it is way too boring for me. Plus I keep waking up early in the morning even though I go to bed at 11pm-1am. Then when I wake up im bored and hot and cranky and not sleepy. Why the hell is it happenin'? I see my therapist this friday at 10.00am. It's been getting better for me since I haven't been so nervous around her since she's really understanding and doesn't seem to judge. I'm watching Will and Grace. Karen is the funniest! Gonna go bye

      It's a desicion that some have to make in their life one time or another. Unfortunately i'm at the point. No one but me will and can make the judgment of who I am and what I want to look like from the outside and inside. No, I am not talking about pot. Cigarettes. Should I do it? What will happen if I do OR don't. Right now I say no but my whacked up head is un decided. My parents both smoke daily, do I want to be like they are, do I want to start an addiction that will never end. Again I say no but my whacked up head is un decided. I just learned tonight by myself how to light a lighter, but barely. What can go wrong or right? These questions lay in my head as I type downstairs on a sunday night. I will NOT smoke tonight or even tomorrow. The future lies ahead for me and my fate. The choices I make now will decide how the rest will turn out. Again I decide to say no. I will keep you updated on my life as it is in havoc mode because I am a sixteen out casted teenager with no life but a life to live.
