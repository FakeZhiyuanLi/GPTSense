      It is true story. Kim is really brave man who works at the station. he is 35 years old. One day, he was walking beside the railway. At that time, suddenly a child was running into the railway, when the train came there. He saw this situation and he decided to save child, so he also ran into the railway. Finally he saved his life but unfortunately he lost his legs because although he saved child, he couldn't keep away himself from the train, so the train crashed into him. Lots of people were worried about him when they heard his accident but he didn't care about his injury.

      Jason is a activity teacher in CPIT. One day he went to Fiji on his holiday. He thaught it will probably be great holiday. In Fiji, accidentally he met Barbara in a skyscraper. Barbara is very beautiful and mad about sports, but she is old fashioned. They fell in love each other at first sight. When Jason was enjoying sunbathing on the beach with lovely Barbara, he saw Tricia who used to work at CPIT. Tricia fired CPIT, because she was a fool, so she was very angry and she stole all of teacher's wages. After that she ran away to Fiji. Tricia keen on Jason. When she was walking in the mall, she saw Jason but he and Barbara were together. Tricia was really angry again, so she decided to kidnap Barbara. One silent night, Tricia broke into Barbara's room and she hitted Barbara's head to make her swoon. Next day, Jason knew suddenly Barbara disappeared, so he went to the Barbara's room that place, he discovered Tricia's ID card and her message. According to her message, she went to south of Fiji and if Jason want to get Barbara, he must prepare 100 millions Dollars. He was embarrassed and called police as soon as possible. He and police man chased Tricia. In fact, the police man was Tricia's friend, so she knew they followed her so she ran away again. Tricia hijacked the train which was very old. Jason followed the train by his porche. Fortunately the train has broken so he could catch her and rescued Barbara. Jason tried to hug Barbara but he couldn't do that, because she is too vast to hug. Oh~~~poor Jason. Anyway, a few years later Jason got married to Barbara and they had lots of children They will be happy forever.  -THE END-
