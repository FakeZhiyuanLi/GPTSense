       So, now that I've had this blog up for a while and haven't created any posts that make any sense whatsover or inspire any intelligent thought, I think I might try my hand at it. Here goes....  Why do squirrels always run to the other side of the tree?

       Ok, so I was at the library, working on the sr high website as usual, and this lady sat down next to me and her little girl stuck her hand in the zip drive and it shut down the stupid computer and this is a run on. Some people are just really dumb.  Hi you are smarter than me because I let stupid people type on my computer.  . Anyway, I'm going to bed now.

       This week is the beginning of my soccer team's pre-season. It wasn't as bad, as last year, and I was more in shape this year. The running was actually pretty easy, come to think of it. I haven't touched a soccer ball all summer though. Band camp was ok last week. I slept over at Andrew's house Friday night and we burned all of our school stuff in a large bonfire. Then we stayed up until 2, playing Halo. Saturday morning my Dad picked me up, then we rode our bikes back past Andrew's house, to the Hortensius' house, which is somewhar in Maryland. It wasn't that difficult, but my dad went so far ahead that I didn't know where to turn.

                 There are by some estimates more than a million weblogs. But most of them get no visibility in search engines. Only a few "A-List" blogs get into the top search engine results for a given topic, while the majority of blogs just don't get noticed. The reason is that the smaller blogs don't have enough links pointing to them. But this posting could solve that. Let's help the smaller blogs get more visibility!   This posting is  urlLink GoMeme  4.0 . It is part of an experiment to see if we can create a blog posting that helps 1000's of blogs get higher rankings in Google. So far we have tried 3 earlier variations. Our first test,  urlLink GoMeme  1.0 , spread to nearly 740 blogs in 2.5 days. This new version 4.0 is  shorter, simpler, and fits more easily into your blog.    Why are we doing this? We want to help thousands of blogs get more visibility in Google and other search engines. How does it work? Just follow the instructions below to re-post this meme in your blog and add your URL to the end of the Path List below. As the meme spreads onwards from your blog, so will your URL. Later, when your blog is indexed by search engines, they will see the links pointing to your blog from all the downstream blogs that got this via you, which will cause them to rank your blog higher in search results. Everyone in the Path List below benefits in a similar way as this meme spreads. Try it!     Instructions:  Just copy this entire post and paste it into your blog. Then add your URL to the end of the path list below, and pass it on! (Make sure you add your URLs as live links or HTML code to the Path List below.)     Path List   1.  urlLink Minding the Planet  2.  urlLink Luke Hutteman's public virtual  MemoryStream  3.  urlLink Michael's Blog  4. (your URL goes here! But first, please copy this line and  move it down to the next line for the next person).    (NOTE: Be sure you paste live links for the Path List or use HTML  code.)

        urlLink MyTheme.com : AIM Expressions Buddy Icons FREE AIM Expression Creator   This site seems to be pretty good for aim buddy icons and expressions, which AOL charges for of course...  Only two more days of band camp, I really should be running, but I don't really care.

       This week has been band camp. It's horrible- 12 hours of the same song with the same boring drill, over and over and over and over again. Tonight was skit night, that was ok. Band isn't as fun as it was last year, but I'm gonna stay with it.

       We just went geocaching around Smyrna, we found both of them successfully. I hate going with my entire family anywhere because everything they say to me seems really dumb. Mom got the CD from Mr. Barr this morning after church, so I'm working on getting those pictures on the site.

         Lamb Jam wasn't as good Saturday as it was Sunday, except for Chris Rice. I really didn't have to do as much Saturday, I'm not sure if that was a good thing. I saw some people from church there, and some people from Smyrna. It was a great festival I guess, just the music wasn't really what I like on Saturday. My Uncle Bob and my cousin (his daughter) Nicolette went to a Grateful Dead concert, which is kind of the opposite of Lamb Jam. They got to our house around 3 this morning (from the Tweeter Center).

         On Friday morning, Uncle Harry brought Me, Kai, and Kirk to Indian River Bay and we did a geocache out in the bay. It was strapped to a bouy. That was pretty cool. We $20 gift certificates for Grottos and had lunch thur.

       I'm staying at my cousin Kai's house in Milford. He goes to Eagles Nest church, which is hosting Lamb Jam, so he got me to volunteer to help out there this weekend. I guess it's fun, we get in for free and can listen to the music while we're parking cars... I got to work the high security gate and let all the band members in, that was fun. At 8, we got to usher for Plum (ok) and Superchi(k) (they were good I guess). We got home around 11:30, dead tired.

       I'm finally done my punishment, and not really sure if I have a limit on computer time now. Comcast is dumb and they changed all our channels, so now we don't get TBS or ABC Family, which had all the movies we watched on. They control everything, those evil pigs. So now the Sr. High site is as good as it's gonna get until I get some content from Mr. Barr. Guess I'll talk later. Bye

       Ok, so now I'm at the library, not sure whether I'm supposed to be on a computer or not, but I am anyway. I got done with Mr. Barr, setting up the GPC Sr. High website, it's doing ok I guess. I'm really bored. I need to get some new guitar music to play.

       Wow, I finally got a blog up and running (like it was that difficult). I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to have this blog be about, it's really just to try it out and tell everyone about my boring life.
