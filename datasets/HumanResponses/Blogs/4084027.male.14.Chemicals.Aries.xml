        Those were my pictures, did you like em? I think Hannah's really fit, but we always have arguments. It sucks, coz I really really like her, but sometimes she's really mean and distant to me..     &nbsp;

          Ah...I went to Luton and Luton market... it was pretty good. I bought a sword necklace with a skull on the top of the sword. It's pretty gothic but looks alright. The guy selling it was a bit of a ledge coz it was £4 but he let me buy it for £3 as long as I dropped a quid&nbsp;for him next time I saw him....I'll pay him back, don't worry :) I was with Georgie, Hannah and Ian.. all of my best mates except for one....the girl that I love! :D She's so fit..     &nbsp;

       urlLink Isn't this site just ledgeful?     Enough of the ego wanking, I'll tell you what I did today. Hannah came over again :D As usual, we just mucked around the whole day..but she came at 1 and went at 5, so we didn't really have that much time... And I'm going away on holiday in 9 days, so I won't really get to see her.. and I've got homework.... FUCK! You're not supposed to get homework in the summer holidays.....  See ya  Steve

       Meh... as I wrote *yawn*, I actaully yawned..how cute ^_^  That's how tired I am.      Why am I tired? Well, I was supposed to go swimming today, but the queues were so long, like 30-40 minutes, and I really can't be arsed to wait that long.....so I borrowed some money, and we went bowling... I ledged it! :P I got 3 strikes in a row, without hitting the sides. I think I got around 150 something, so I won! ^_^       T  hen we got these vouchers which gave us free entry to ice skating, and there was hardly a queue for that, so we decided we'd do that. But it turned out the vouchers only worked in September so that went to shit...       We went in the arcade and did one of the racing games. I won again! :P I did it with style with my Ferrari, going sideway round the corners and shoving people into the river.... ^_^      We got bored again... so we went to this rip off cash machine that charged us £1.50 to take some money out.. We didn't really wanna lose £1.50, but Georgie had 147 quid, so it wasn't too bad :P       We took the money out and went ice skating. It was a bit weird at first. I thought it would be like blading, because I can do pretty much everything on blades, except there too small for me. I got the hang of it, and could beat everyone going backwards :P I'm a bit cocky...      I hope this post doesn't fuck up....      Steve

       Hannah came over my house yesterday. We just mucked around for the whole day, and we went to Lassiters for lunch. It was pretty good :P      I'm going swimming today with Ian and Georgina hopefully so it should be good fun. Hannah G is on holiday, and Hana C doesnt wanna cum :(       I wish Hana C wouldn't be so shy sometimes. She won't come because she doesn't want me to see her in a bikini, but she actaully has a great body :)       Anyway, please people, comment! I wanna know how I'm doing ^_^      Steve

      Hey  Been busy the last few days with Hannah ;) It was quite fun, her just staying around mine. I think she enjoyed it as well.. :P  Yesterday, I had to teach her a piece on guitar. :S It was pretty complicated but she still wanted to learn it. It was Nothing Else Matters by Metallica...I could only play that properly after 5 months but she's trying to learn it at 3. Still, she suprised me, and she was well good at it. I was s'posed to teach her Plug In Baby by Muse, but, she seemed more interested in that.. :) I'm going round to her dads house today hopefully, so that should be alright..  Steve
