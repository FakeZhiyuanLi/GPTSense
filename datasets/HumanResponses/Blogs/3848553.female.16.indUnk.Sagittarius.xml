        Again, I was reading the book  Do Fish Drink Water?  by Bill McLain and found something that intrigued me. There are 21 colors of M&M's! I have no idea about this. I mean, I knew that there were different colors for different occassions, such as the pastels for Easter, but I had no clue that there were that many colors.  The 21 colors are as follows:  black ,  blue ,  light blue ,  dark blue ,  brown ,  cream ,  gold ,  gray ,  green ,  aqua green ,  teal green ,  dark green ,  maroon ,  orange ,  pink ,  dark pink ,  purple ,  light purple ,  red ,  white , and  yellow . There used to be a tan colored M&amp;M, but they were replaced with the blue M&M's in 1995. This caused a backlash on M&amp;M sales -- people said that the blue M&M's murdered the tan M&amp;M's.  The colors have also become well known for other things, as well. For example, the green M&M's are said to be aphrodisiacs. Orange M&amp;M's are said to enlarge breasts. If brown M&M's are found anywhere at a Van Halen set, they will cancel the show. Also, some people still won't eat the red M&amp;M's from the Red No. 2 (a type of red dye) scare back in 1976, even though these red M&amp;M's never contained that particular red dye.

          I was reading this book today entitled  Do Fish Drink Water?&nbsp; Puzzling and Improbable Questions and Answers  and read something that intrigued me.  There was a section about Dracula and then, it gives you protection advice against vampires.&nbsp; Most of you are familiar with the methods of hanging garlic around your neck and holding a cross in front of you.&nbsp; I've come across two other ways to ward off blood-suckers (AKA vampires) that I was unaware of before.&nbsp; They are sprinkling poppy seeds (or really, any type of seed for that matter) and constant bell ringing.  Apparently vampires have an obsession with counting seeds.&nbsp; If you spread seeds around your house, the vampire will become preoccupied with counting them and lose interest in you.  Also, I suppose that vampires do not like bells ringing, so the book suggests keeping a wind chime or two.  I don't know if any of you find this as interesting as I do, but if you dont...well...I don't care.&nbsp; haha.

       "Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of '99: Wear sunscreen!&nbsp; If I could offer one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it.&nbsp; The longterm benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists; whereas, the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience.  ...  But trust me on the sunscreen."  I went to Cedar Point this weekend and got pretty badly burnt.&nbsp; Of course, Katie and I had forgot to bring the sunscreen, hence the reason for the redness.&nbsp; So, I say to you all now --&nbsp;even if you do not pay attention to any other entry I write or don't take me seriously, please -- wear sunscreen!

      We've all heard that popular ending to stories and fairy tales.&nbsp; It brings a smile to everyone's face.&nbsp; They make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside and that good feeling is supposed to stay with you.  But how many times does the "happily ever after" really happen?&nbsp; You see people in love all the time, but honestly, how many relationships are absolutely perfect?&nbsp; I wish those happy endings were true.&nbsp; Then maybe the world would be a lot better place and there wouldn't be so much hate everywhere you look.&nbsp;   Most people say that those wonderful endings that happen in story books and in the movies make them all happy.&nbsp; Not me.&nbsp; They actually make me feel sad and alone.&nbsp; They make me long for something more than this world could possibly give me.&nbsp; I want the fairy tale.&nbsp; I want the handsome prince on a beautiful white stallion.&nbsp; I want it all!  Oh now look -- I've gone and depressed myself just thinking about it.&nbsp; I better go before I get all wishy-washy.

      "Last night I was looking at the sky and matching one reason why I love you for every star.  I was doing good -- until I ran out of stars."  Have you ever sat outside late at night and looked at the stars?  Last night at 2:30AM, I had the urge to just go outside.  Once I was out there, I noticed how clear the night sky was, and how it was filled with beautiful gleaming stars.  Just the site of them took my breath away.  Although I was only outside a shot while, I was so captivated that I wished my boyfriend had been there to take in the splendor os it all and to share that wonderful moment.  I don't think very many people today appreciate the beauty of the stars anymore.  People are too busy and frantic to take time out to just look at the stars and see how gorgeous they really are.  To me, they are probably the prettiest things I've ever seen, but it seems like most people just take them for granted -- and that's a shame because those people are really missing out on the beautiful, romantic picture they paint.

      Money is a very powerful thing.  It can not only purchase items, but change people.  Teenagers today don't realize the value of the dollar -- and yes, I'm one of those teenagers.  But at the present moment, I have practically no money.  That sucks.    Teenagers like to buy things.  I'm one of those teens, too.  I have friends who like to go places that for some reason, seem to cost an ungodly amount of cash.  Now, I know that paying, say, 6 dollars for a movie isn't all THAT much money.  Well, it is to me!  I don't have 6 dollars, so it's a HELL of a lot of dough!  Those little pieces of green fabric have a lot of influence on what people do with their lives.  Now, I know another thing you're thinking, "I don't think going to see a movie or not will effect my life that dramatically."  You don't know that.  Maybe if you spend those 6 bucks on a movie, and you see something in it that touches you to go and be, say, a police officer or something -- those 6 dollars have just effected the rest of your life.  I know I said earlier that I have no money, but after this weekend, I think I will be coming into a semi-large amount of the green stuff.  I think I'm prepared to spend of lot of 6 dollar bills (well, just 6 dollars in general, I spose) to go see a lot of movies to alter my life.  Wish me luck!

      Last night I was cleaning out all the junk from under my bed and I found some things that reminded me of my past.  I found some pictures of my friends and I back in the day, and it reminded me of how simpler things are when you're younger.  The life of a teenager is not an easy one.  Although I don't think I would want to have to grow up all over again, sometimes I think it would be nice to go back to my adolescence just so things wouldn't be so complicated.  I found old letters and card from my family and family friends.  It made me think of happier times w/ those people.  I know in my last blog, I kinda ripped on my units.  Well, when I was younger -- when I received those cards (birthday cards, valentines cards, etc.) -- and my parents and I got along very well.  I miss those days.  All we do now is fight and bicker about petty things.  I found things from when my cousin and I would play school and from my Camp Inquire days.  I really valued learning things back then.  Not that I don't now, but back then, I really WANTED to learn.  Anymore, I don't care if I learn something or not.  My love for learning and education was somehow lost over the years.  I found letters from this girl, whom I used to call my best friend.  But that's the thing -- "used to".  We don't talk anymore.  But we had wonderful times together when we were kids.  We lived across from each other and hung out every day.  Even when both of us moved, we still lived close and saw each other daily.  Then she moved to Florida w/ her grandma b/c of money problems in her family.  We'd write to each other and once or twice a month, my mom would let me call her.  Then she moved to Indiana.  We still wrote and called each other, but never saw each other.  Then one day, I just stopped answering her calls for stupid reasons.  She stopped calling me all together.  I haven't talked to her in about 2 years.  Pretty sad, huh?  Finally, I found some letters from and pictures of best person I've ever known -- Lendsay Zimmerman.  She and I were very close...and I'd like to think that we still are.  For those of you who don't know about her, she was a wonderful person.  She really cherished life and her friends.  She was smart and compassionate.  Just being friends w/ her made me a better person.  In 5th grade, she had to move to a different part of town and could no longer attend my school.  She was so depressed that she couldn't be w/ her friends anymore.  Shortly after that, she was diagnosed w/ luekemia.  All of us had such high hopes of her being okay.  Despite her condition, she was still optimistic.  She was doing well and in her letters wrote about how her cancer was in remission (meaning, there was 0% luekemia in her body).  A short 5 months later, she went into the hospital and passed away.  But defore her death, she and I had a huge fight.  I'm going to regret that for the rest of my life, b/c even tho we were still friends, I never actually got to say I was sorry.  The past can teach of many things.  Here's what I learned: Remember the simple times, and try not to be so hard on yourself now. No matter how much you say you hate your parents, deep down, you really love them.  Despite fighting, they love you, too.  Hopefully you can find something, wuch as I did, to remind you of that. School sucks, but don't take your education for granted.  It's the most valuable thing you have. Try to keep in touch w/ your friends, b/c it's a sad day when you let a friendship die. Always always ALWAYS say you're sorry.  No matter what.  You never know when the people you love aren't going to be around and you don't have the chance to take back all the things you've said and done.  I learned that the hard way.

      Wow, do I hate my parents.  They drive me absolutely NUTZ!  I can't stand being in this house anymore cuz I can't be around my parents.  My dad and I had a fight tonite and personally, I don't care if I ever talk to him again.  And it was the stupidest thing, too.  I mentioned that I want to go to the zoo w/ some friends sometime, so he starts going off about not knowing how to get there, not having money...like I'm a child.  He kept saying things to discourage my going.  So I finally said, "Okay, we won't go."  And he automatically assumes that I'm being a bitch at that moment.  I hate it when he does that!  And it's all the time.  He makes it impossible for me to talk to him.  I wish I had different parents all the time -- or maybe just a different dad.  My mom's purdy cool sometimes, but she needs to let up on some things.  For example, I've had my lisence for 3 months and she won't even let me drive out of town.  I mean, I can understand her not wanting me to go very far, but she frowns upon me even going to the next town over, which, as most of you know, is only about 15 minutes away.  Talk about keeping me on a short leash!  And whenever I wanna just drive around w/ my friends, she always seems to make sure that I'm not driving.  C'mon, woman!  Give me a break!    So, did I mention that I can't stand my parents?  Well -- I can't.  I'm anxiously awaiting the day when I can leave this house and this town, for that matter...that is, if my mom will ever let me drive out of this town!  Ugh -- well, I'm gonna go before I get too steamed.  I'll see ya'll later.

      Okay, Megan had her splurge about hottie celebs -- Now it's Stephanie's turn!  Of course, I hafta start off w/ the outragously gorge Colin Ferrall!  He's SUCH a BABE!  And you can't get much better than an Irish actor.  Maybe that's just me talking, since I'm a great deal Irish myself.  His accent rocks, too!  And if you're a follower of the great CF, then you know he's a total bad-ass -- what a turn on!  In my opinion, that man probably needs to be raped to pay attention to a woman.  And personally, I would love to be the one to do it, too.  :)  Next, just a country over (Scotland), is the native land of the wonderfully handsome, dimple-chined hottie, Ewan McGregor.  Again, a man w/ an accent wins my heart over any American actors.  I mean, c'mon, you gotta love a guy who says "arse" instead of "ass"!  :)  And (another one of my opinions), he presents himself as a nice, well-mannered person.  He's a man you need to love passionately.  I could do that, too!  ;)  Then, there's the attractive, appealing Heath Ledger.  Once again, accents reign over all.  This one's a little far from the others, tho.  He's an aussi.  Hottie from down under.  Lemme tell ya, he's a hunk I'd love to be down under!  ;)    Finally on my list is the incredibly talents, the great Johnny Depp.  No accent, unless he's playing a character w/ one, but in this case, that matters not.  There isn't a role that that man doesn't look hott in -- even when he's playing the timid Edward Scissorhands or the scruffy pirate Jack Sparrow.  It's just impossible for him to look bad!    Talking about JD makes me think of other older actors that are still sizzling -- Christian Slater, Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, just to name a few.  Some ppl really do age gracefully!    Well, that's it for this rant.  See ya next time!

      Have you ever had little questions pop up in your head that started out "What would happen if..."?  Me being a naturally curious person, these type of thoughts appear quite often.  And more often than more, they are questions that can most likely never be answered, or are so odd that no one would want to try to see what would happen.  One question that had crossed my thoughts over and over again is: "What would happen if you strapped a piece of buttered bread to a cat?"  I know what you must be thinking at this point, "Why on earth would you even come up w/ such a question?!"  Well, think about it.  Cats always land on their feet, right?  And it's said that buttered bread always lands w/ the buttered side down.  So, if you put them together, what would happen?  Which end would land?  My friends and I have a thoery that the creation would continuously spin in a hover just above the ground.  What do you think?

      Hello, I'm back again.  You're probably thinking, "Why does she feel the need to write twice in one day?"  Well, obviously, you paid no attention to the title of this rant.  It's "Bordom".  In other words, I have nothing better to do w/ my life than to share my thoughts w/ you wonderful people!  :)  So you should feel happy that I like talking to you.  Being bored can do wonderful and strange things to a person.  It brings many creative ideas, altho some of them may be quite idiotic.  Such as, I was sitting here listening to my Josie and the Pussycats soundtrack when this thought crossed my mind: Wouldn't it be cool to start up a female punk rock band?  And then that idea was quickly shot down when I remembered that I can neither play the guitar nor the drums.  What a waste of the thought process!  But like I said, that's what bordom does to ya.  Bordom causes odd daydreams as well.  Several little scenes have played themselves out in my wandering brain.  Some funny, some romantic, others just weird as hell!  Why does this happen?  Because the mind has nothing to constructively occupy itself so it makes up its own ways to entertain itself.  Now, at this phase, the bordom has set in as such that I'm probably starting to think a little philisophically.  But I think maybe I'll save that for another time.  Until then, see ya later!

      Hey all out there!  If you couldn't guess by the title, this is my first blog!  Woo-hoo!  Now Stephanie has a place to vent about anything and everything she wants to!  Haza!  And lemme tell ya, I usually have a lot to say.  Most of you know that already, tho, right?  Haha.  In fact, most of you know that it's hard to shut me up at times.  But hey, what's life if you can't speak your mind?  It's always good to have your own opinions and to voice them (at appropriate times, I might add).  And as you can guess, I've had my fair share of making myself heard when I shoulda kept my big mouth shut.  :)  I guess that's one of the things that keeps my life interesting  One of the other things that keeps my life interesting is my wonderful group of friends -- the ones who try to guide the misguided one (me).  Er, if they don't guide me, they lead me further astray, like my boyfriend, Billy.  That boy has corrupted the essence that was Stephanie.  LOL.  But he's great and I love him for all the misadventures we have. :)  My other friends are wonderful as well.  Megan, Mallory, Amy F, and Mallory are prolly my bestest buds.  I tell them EVERYTHING.  So, if you're ever lookin' for some good dirt on me, you can just mosey your way over to them, and I'm sure they'll be glad to keep my secrets safe for me -- unless you pay them a LARGE sum of green stuff (and no, I don't mean leaves, grass, etc.).  Well, I think that's about it for now.  Come back later and I'm sure I'll have more rants and raves!

      Fighting -- everyone does it.  It's in our nature as humans.  Whether we want to or not, it happens.  We fight with our parents, significant others, friends...  If there's someone to fight with, we usually end up doing it.  I had a fight with my boyfriend the other night.  It was bad.  I started it, naturally, me being the opinionated and "hafta be heard" person I am.  But it was something that I thought needed to be taken care of.  It was probably the second most painful (emotionally painful, that is) thing I've ever gone through!  But in the long run, I think it was good for us.  I know he really cares about me and we seem to able to talk about things more freely now.  Fighting is inevidable.  Sometimes necessary.  Even though we seem to hate fighting with one another, I think it's actually a postive thing.  It brings out the true nature of people.  You find out different things.  Like, if you have a fight with a friend and you end up never talking again, then that just goes to show you that you just weren't meant to be friends.  True friends don't let a stupid fight get in the way of their relationship.  Fighting with a loved ones shows you how much they really care about you.  Fighting with parents -- well...that's just fun!  Haha.

      For those of you who know me, you may or may not know of my very good friend, Lendsay Zimmerman.  She was a wonderful girl with both brains and beauty.  But sadly, she passed away at the age of 11 to leukemia.  I've been thinking about her a lot lately.  It's coming close to her 5 year...um...anniversary (her death).  I suppose that's why I've been thinking about her.  I always get kind of depressed around this time of year because I start to miss her.  I mean, I miss her all the time, but it's especially hard around this time.  You would think that after all these years, the pain of loosing a dear friend would at least be lessened.  But last night, I cried for hours thinking about her.  I wonder what my life would be like if she were still here.  I wonder if she and I would still be friends.  I would certainly hope so.  She was the most wonderful person I knew.  I wonder if, that, if she were still alive, would her purity and love of life still be there?  She was also one of the most jovial people I knew.  If she were still here, would I be friends with the people I'm friends with now?  Would I be with my boyfriend?  I mean, you can honestly never know what things would be different if there was one more or one less person in your life.  I also wonder where she is right now.  I'd like to think that she's in Heaven.  But I'm not really sure if I believe in Heaven.  I want to think that she's no longer going through any pain.   These things lead me to wonder what happens when a person dies.  I've thought about it so many times.  I just can't even fathom not existing anymore.  Why do people die?  When they pass away, do they just cease to be or does their body, spirit, soul take on other forms?  Is there a Heaven and a Hell?  I think that, if people knew the answers to some of these questions, dying wouldn't scare people as much.  I know it scares the shit outta me!  If also heard of many "near death experiences".  Is what these people experience really what happens when a person dies?  This then, leads me to the question of spirits/ghost/apparitions.  Are they real?  I'd like to think they are.  Just for the simple fact that, I believe that when I was little (about 3 years old), I saw my grandfathers spirit after he passed away.  They say that children are more likely to see ghosts and such because they are innocent and don't know any better.  Is this what happened to me?  Or when children see things like that, is it just a figment of that innocent mind?  Perhaps trying to cope with the loss of a beloved grandfather, grandmother, etc.?  All I know is that, if spirits really do exist, I would give anything to see Lendsay's to talk to her just one more time.

      Last night, my friend Mallory and I went to the county fair to see Broken Yoke, a Christian rock group.  I'd seen them several times before, but Mallory was a first timer.  She absolutely loved it!   Now, I know what some of you must be thinking, "Christian rock?!?!"  Well, I thought the same thing before I first saw them.  I'm not really a church goer, myself, but I really liked them.  They can deliver a powerful message with their music.  They also have a beatiful speech in the program.  It's not really a speech, but it's wonderful.  Even I get emotional!  But it's not just about the prayer, either.  It's about the music.  They really know how to put on a great show!  Not to mention, they're pretty hott!  The lead singer, Jon Lepinski, has chiseled lookd fit for model-dom.  The guitarist, Matt Sawmiller...wow...there's hardly words to describe him!  They have a new bass player, so I don't know his name yet...but he's purdy darn good lookin' too!  The drummer, Tom Lepinski, is somewhat lacking in the looks department, however.  But when he lacks in hottness, he definitely makes up for in presentation.  You watch him pounding on that drum set and you can just tell he's having a great time!  Not only are the members hott, but they're extremely nice!  I talk to them after every show that I go to, and most times, they remember who I am.   For those of you who aren't familiar of the gospel (er...rock) or Broken Yoke, I encourage you to visit their website:   urlLink www.brokenyoke.com

       Actually, it's an excerpt from  The Restuarant at the End of the Universe  by Douglas Adams.  "The Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy" is a made up book that contains information about everything in the universe.  Well, here goes:             The Universe -- some information to help you live in it.       1     AREA:  Infinite.         The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  offers this definition of the word "Infinite."            Infinite:   Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some.  Much bigger than that in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally stunning size, real "wow, that's big," time.  Infinity is just so big that by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy.  Gigantic multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the sort of concept we're trying to get across here.         2     IMPORTS:  None .           It is impossible to import things into an infinite area, there being no outside to import things in from.         3     EXPORTS:  None .           See Imports.         4     POPULATION:  None .           It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amounth of space for them to be in.  However, not every one of them is inhabited.  Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds.  Any finite number divided by infinity is near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be said to be zero.  From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.         5     MONETARY UNITS:  None .           In fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the Galaxy, but none of them count.  The Altairian Dollar has recently collapsed, the Flainian Pobble Bead is only exchangable for other Flainian Pobble Beads, and the Triganic Pu has its own very special problems.  Its exchange rate of eight Ningis to one Pu is simple enough, but since a Ningi is a triangular rubber coin six thousand eight hundred miles along each side, no one has ever collected enough to own one Pu.  Ningis are not negotiable currency, because the Galactibanks refuse to deal in fiddling small change.  From this basic premise it is very simple to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged imagination.         6     ART:  None .           The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there simply isn't a mirror bit enough -- see point one.         7     SEX:  None          Well, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely because of the total lack of money, trade, banks, art or anything else that might keep all the nonexistent people of the Universe occupied.           However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now because it really is terribly complicated.  For further information see  Guide  Chapters seven, nine, ten, eleven, fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four inclusive, and in fact most of the rest of the  Guide .               If you thought that was at least semi-entertaining, I encourage you to read the Hitchhiker's books.  The one's that I know of are, in order:   The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy ,  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe ,  Life, The Universe and Everything ,  So Long and Thanks for all the Fish , and  Mostly Harmless.   I find them quite humorous.  I hope you would, too.

      It's an odd thing, depression.  It seems to hit me at the weirdest times and for not apparent reason.  Like, right now, but no reason whatsoever, I'm quite depressed.  I shouldn't be, though, because I just got home from a great night hanging out with my boyfriend.  Just a little over half an hour ago, I was laughing and having a great time.  Now, I'm almost in tears.  I really wish I knew why this happens to me.  I'm not the only one, either.  I have a few friends that will, all of a sudden, just become depressed.  As with me, it usually follows something very fun and exciting.  I wish I could help them, but I also wish I could help myself.  Also, it seems to me that, no matter if it's been a good or bad day, at night is when I'm most sensitive and most likely to become depressed.  Like right now -- it's 9 minutes are midnight.  This is also a trend with my friends who go though all this.  So, im desparation, I'm posting this question for anyone who reads this: Why do I get depressed at night, after I've have SO much fun?  And how can I make it stop?
