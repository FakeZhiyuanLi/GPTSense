      Press Fanatic here!! Rick has just upgraded the studio and is finally able to get 100% out of it. We should be in for some interesting music for the next album after 'Off the Deep End'. I guess it's no surprise that Rick would switch to pop. His music has always had a dance edge to it since his dance club days. With 'Off the Deep End' finally ready to makes it debut there has been word that the produciton of that album took a very large toll on the musician. He hasn't said anything publically yet about the work, but we can expect a press release when the album is ready for release.  Rumor has it Rick has also been working on the side with his friend Victor who is a producer. We're hoping to get more on this soon!  Keep sending me your questions and e-mails at:  urlLink pf@rickkrenmayer.com

      Hey there!  This is my first press release. I would have had one up sooner, but business has had me out straight. Yes the rumors are true about me heading into pop music. I've allways had an interest in pop and dance music over the years. So it's about time I finally head down that road for real. I have the most fun in that genre out of any other I find.  I'm still working on the finishing touches with the release of 'Off the Deep End'. I can't wait until it's out because I've been working on it far too long. It'll be nice to start composing happier, more upbeat songs than I have been. It will be a change, but it will be a nice needed change. I have to get back to work, but stay tuned. I'm releasing a new single very soon!!!  -RK

      Third Rail to play first show as opener on Thursday May 6th, 2004 at the New Wave in New Bedford!!! Rick has notified us that Third Rail is planning on opening up for a group on that day. "Look forward to the playlist people!! This is good stuff." Rick has told us. Looks like I'll see you at the New Wave to watch Rick take the stage for his first band performance since 1999.  -PF

      Unbelievable!!!! Rick is finally part of a band again and yes he is on the bass too!!! Currently Rick is studying the music for the group and so far he says things are going great. The group would be classified as alternative rock, but Rick sees more in the group than that.   "I love the music. I have a great time playing the songs with the guys and I see a lot of potential in what we are doing. We all are very serious about music and doing something great with it in our lives. I have been wanting to finally grow as a bass player and I think that this is the perfect opportunity to make some progress. I am very psyched to get back out there with my friend Kris Bok. We used to have a blast back in the days of Substitute and finally we can reunite, but for something much more serious this time. I am very great full to have this chance to work with Third Rail and I thank them all for inviting me in to the band. We will be playing within the next two months so stay tuned. This time it's for real. These guys don't mess around" -Rick   Rick recently has promised himself that he would make music his top priority in his life again. He has been back and forth from his life as a musician many times in the last couple of years, but now has a chance to focus and really get involved with it again. Rick said he was going to take pictures, but not everyone could make it to the practice tonight. Hopefully we can start seeing some of the action!!  -PF

      Rick has completed Off the Deep End and is ready to start selling copies. Off the Deep End is Rick's most intense album yet. It makes the previous 2-disc collection, "Music for the Down" look like the Mr. Rogers of dark music. Expect a press release in the coming days.  - PF

      Hi yall!! It's my first press release in a while and I have great news!!! Tonight was a very good night for Third Rail. Despite minor technical difficulties in the first song the band shredded through the set list like it was a minor practice. We had great feedback about the songs and the performance and even though my bass had some problems I am definitely happy with my performance and very psyched for the next show. I'd like to thank all my friends who attended my first major appearance in a very long time. Your being there meant a lot. Also I'd like to give a big thanks to Nelson, Mike, Kris and Larry for making me a member of the group. I will keep everyone posted on upcoming Third Rail outings. The Third Rail web site at www.thirdrailrocks.com will be up soon too!!!! So that is another great way of keeping track. Currently the set dates we have are private parties, but since we are "the band that cares" we will be back real soon. Stay tuned as allways!!  - Rick

      Well, well there super fans!!! Third Rail rocked it out again this Friday at the New Wave and this time there were no bass problems. Things are going great with the band!! We just had one of the songs from the demo played on the radio which was awesome. I was so pumped to hear something that I'm involved in on the public air waves even though I wasn't in that recording. Very cool stuff!!! I'm enjoying being in the group more than words can describe. I'm finally in a group that is like me in drive and personality so that is very important. We know how to have a good time and there is really never a dull moment. Something cool is always happening.  I have actually given my bass a name. For years i have toyed with the idea, but I never really did anything about it. Now since Mike has a name for every one of his drums I just had to give my bass a name. "Vince Clortho Lecutis" is the name. If you can tell me in the message board how I got the name you will get 20 cool points!!! So look for me with “Vince Clortho Lecutis” the bass on the local scene with Third Rail!!  In other news, I have been writing quite a bit lately. I'm close to doing about a song a week now. Pretty soon I'm going to have to stop to complete the songs and master them for a new release. Yes, yes, I know, "Off the Deep End" is coming out. It's actually going to be for download so don't worry. I'm actually looking forward to the new release. It'll be nice to actually have it out instead of just talking about it.  That's it for the news, but check back soon!!! Resistance is Futile.  - Rick

      Finally the recording for the  urlLink Third Rail  album is done!!!  Larry came down today to finish the final backing vocals tracks to complete the recording sessions.  Now the mixing portion can begin then we'll move on to the mastering.  I have decided to get the mastering plug-in for my studio so I will officially have a complete setup.  Finally after 5 years of building the studio it will be complete.    I will keep you posted on the latest with the  urlLink Third Rail  songs.  Finally we have some news on my solo album,  Off the Deep End .  The cover art is complete and I promise the album will be coming out after the  urlLink Third Rail  songs are completed.  Check out the cover!!!      That's all the tasting I can allow for Off the Deep End at this point, but stay tuned.

      Today I had to do business until about 8 PM then finally I came back to see that the Red Sox didn't suck tonight.  Thank god!!!  I only got a little time in the studio today.  I actually think I've stumbled upon a better way to engineer the  urlLink Third Rail  sound.  In the mastering process I'm going to do things a little different.  We'll see what happens.  Stay tuned!!!!  oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!

      Larry, Nelson and I continued working on the recording of the next six  urlLink Third Rail  songs today.  Things didn't really go as planned as we were hoping to actually get all of the vocal tracks finalized in one day.  That's the way it goes sometimes though.  Sometimes recording can speed right by other times it can take a real long time.  We'll see what happens this Saturday with the songs.  We should be able to get a good chunk done.  In other news regarding the studio, I'm looking to invest in some new mastering software plugins for my studio setup.  I'm not too sure if it's going to happen, but I'm leaning towards yes.  It would make everything sound a hell of a lot better when if comes time for the final mix. Of course the manufacturer has a great deal going on!!! Sure, why not splurge some more?!?!?!?!  Don't you want to live at your parents house for ever?!?! Don't you!?!?!  Anyways, besides cool stuff going on in the studio I did the typical Tuesday night deal: work out until my muscles are worthless then go sing karaoke in a smoke filled bar.  What a great surprise this time though.  NO SMOKE!!!!  I must be dreaming or something.  Actually the state of Massachusetts banned smoking in all public establishments so I can sing karaoke without getting my vocal cords wiped out and having to destroy my clothes when I return home.  The only drawback now is that the bars are more empty, but that will change as people get used to it.  Check out the local karaoke scene that I hit up if you are interested.

       The  urlLink Third Rail  recording sessions that were scheduled for today are postponed until tomorrow.  For the first time in a while I actually had a day off.  The office was shut off today!!!  Since I didn't work on business or music today I cleaned up the studio and the rest of the house to get ready for the return of   the family  .  That's right,   the family   is coming back from the tropics so Nick and I are running around cleaning up the mess.  This time the house is spotless compared to the last time everyone went away.       The only artisic thing I did today was mess around with a couple of photos using the curves feature in Photoshop.  Here is a picture of me, which can be found on the  urlLink Third Rail  web site, and a photo of my brother Nick.  Both of these photos were taken at my graduation party two weeks back.

      Hi there!  Well the U.S. is 228 years old and the partying has been non-stop all weekend.  Between going from party to party and a wedding there hasn't been much time to be in the studio much to complete work on the Off the Deep End release.  I'm hoping to get back to wrap up that album since its release is now overdue by a year about.  It would be nice to release that and prepare for the next album.  Off the Deep End has actually been a finished product since the beginning of September in 2003.   Due to business and other obligations the project has been patiently waiting for its release date.  The Third Rail songs are coming along now.  The lead vocals are done and now we are just waiting to complete the backing vocals.  I may also redo the bass on all the songs since I am extremely anal and I don't like the way it's sounding at the moment.  Since tomorrow is a practice day we should be able to complete most if not all of the backing vocals and start up the final mixing process.

      Finally the software I have been waiting for is in.  Studio work will continue as normal.  Rumors are flying around that  urlLink Third Rail  may have a show this Friday.  I guess  urlLink Rooftop Suicide Club  may need a filler.  That would be very cool.  We'll see what happens with that.  I am continuing to work on the release of  Off the Deep End .  Also on the side I have been recording the next album which is mostly written and just waiting to be recorded.  I'm not going to talk about that much since OTDE isn't even out yet.     For your enjoyment here is a recent picture of me in the studio.  YES, I did shave my head!!  Other than that there isn't much happening.  I have been visited by old ghosts of old relationships lately, but that is as far as that part of the conversation is going.  Especially now that Off the Deep End is coming out there is no need for ultra dark music from me anymore.  So anything depressing isn't making it to my albums from here on out.  We'll see how long I stick to that one!!!

      Yep, I got screwed out of completing the studio today.  My mastering software that I have been waiting for has come in, but it is the wrong  version of the software.  I ordered the full version and received the upgrade.  Fortunately after kicking and screaming they agreed to take it back and give me the one I ordered.  So today I have nothing to report.  Until next time download some of my music to keep yourself busy while waiting for more juicy news.  My Music:   urlLink rickkrenmayer.com

      Albeit a short one, today was a great day in the studio.  The sound is light-years ahead of where it was just a few weeks back.  I'm actually thinking about re-mastering some of the older recordings that I have made in the past.  We'll see where that idea goes.  Right now the main focus is getting the  urlLink Third Rail  songs done and out of the way.  Once those are complete Off the Deep End will finally reach the Internet.  So as you can see re-mastering isn't much of a high priority right now.  I've been toying with the idea of a singles collection which I would re-master songs for sure in that case.  Other than all that stuff I spent the day sleeping so nothing new has happened.  Go Red Sox!!!

      Real quick:  I've been continuing on the quest for the master.  I think   I have a sound that is going to work.  I noticed that the saturation of some of the mastering was causing crackles.  I don't like crackles and pops.  I'm going to continue with this tomorrow.  I'm tired now so I'm heading to bed.

      Well the process continues on the  urlLink Third Rail  songs. I had a great session today. I actually didn't have much time to begin with so when I sat down I was amazed that I came very close to a final master to one of the songs as fast as I did. Hopefully the rest of the songs will go as fast as this one, but quality comes first. I don't want to rush things. Here are a couple of photos from today's session.                  The weekend definitely went by very fast this time. Mostly it's my fault for being out too late at bars and parties, but I only live once so whatever. Stay tuned for more cool news on the new Third Rail songs.

      It's very late, but I figured I would lay down a post before I got to sleep.  I have started the mastering process on the  urlLink Third Rail  songs. The first song has already made it through the mastering, but I am going to push it through the process one more time to make sure I actually like the sound I am hearing. I figure I should expect to use up about 4 hours per song in order to get the masters complete. I don't think that is too bad considering this whole recording process has gone pretty fast when I look back at how much we got done in the amount of time it took to record it.   Check back soon for more news on the mastering of the Third Rail songs.

      Finally a day back in the studio. I managed to squeeze this time in between my totally bogus work day which I had today and going to bed. It paid off though. Though it took me 2 hours of takes just to find the right bass line for one of the songs it was still worth it. Now that song is also complete. That makes 2 with my official stamp of approval for the  urlLink Third Rail  release.  Stay tuned as I round the bases as I come closer to making the songs finished.

      Well, I guess it's a good thing that this week is over. Work was ridiculous, I didn't get much time to master much of the Third Rail material. On top of that there are other little tiny things in my daily life which are really pissing me off. Other than that everything is great!!!     I've completed close to 3 of the songs now. I'm sure by tomorrow the number will be 3 total. I'm heading to bed I need to get some sleep. I'm sure I'll have another update for you tomorrow.

      Finally some great progress is being made.  I have pretty much completed 4 songs out of the 6  urlLink Third Rail  songs that have been recorded. These 4 are at about 95% done so I'm getting there. Today my new studio monitors showed up. It's nice to work with great reference equipment again. Now I'll be able to hear anything that sounds a little messy and be able to fix it.  In other news, I am getting ready to master my album  "Off the Deep End"  finally.  After the  urlLink Third Rail  songs are done I'm going into overdrive to get that album out finally.  Past the release of  "Off the Deep End"  is another album and new songs.  A more poppy album is coming.  Also it may not be just me producing my next album.   Oh my god!!!  Why wont you tell us more????!!!!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!   Now that I've got you all excited go download the latest releases on my site:  urlLink rickkrenmayer.com

      The mastering continues on the rest of the songs. We're almost at 4 songs completely done. I'm continuously working on them now. I'm hoping by the end of the week I have the final versions of the songs. Also we will be remastering all of the old  urlLink Third Rail  songs to achieve equality between all of the tracks in the final album. Stay tuned for the latest as we get the end of the mixing and mastering.

      Well things are progressing with the masters for  urlLink Third Rail .  Recently I had to back pedal and remaster all of the tracks again though.  I listened to what I had and I just didn't like it.  I hate being a perfectionist sometimes because it messes with my schedule which I am 2 weeks behind now.  The weather outside the studio was just scrumptious yesterday.  With the remains of Tropical Storm Bonnie we had about and inch and a half of rain in under an hour.  Driving was fun.  Lately I've been looking at picking up another instrument.  Right now I'll call it the mystery instrument.  I don't want to spoil the surprise when everyone is finally able to see it.  I hoping a couple of months I'll be able to order the thing.  Now I bet you won't be able to sleep for months while waiting in suspense.

      For all intensive purposes the 6  urlLink Third Rail  songs are finally done. I had to actually totally remaster them between yesterday and today. I like the way it sounds now. The band and I will just sit down to look over the stuff to see if there is anything else that needs to be fixed. I'm going to be remastering the original eight tracks also, but that is going to be easy compared to a full blown production.  Other than that Tropical Storm Charley visited the studio this morning around 7:30 AM. What makes this awesome is that I went to bed at 2:30 AM and when the rains started coming down and smacking my air conditioner in my room it was so loud it woke me up. We need the rain around here so Charley was actually welcome in this area.   My father and I have measured about 3.5" of rain in the last two days. Not bad since this is usually our driest part of the year.  Now that I'm pretty much done with the six songs I'm going to clean the studio and play some of my favorite Mozart pieces on the piano. I haven't played them in a while so I'll have to read the music all over again. :-(
