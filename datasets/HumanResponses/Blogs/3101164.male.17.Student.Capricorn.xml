       >> oh who the hell am i kidding  there is no way i can deviate from my usual theme.  i just had to tell my friend what papi chulo meant and now i dont even know if he is.   but luckily from what he told me my theory holds up  until it is proven other wise to me that it is not true, then it is.  so i dunno whats gonna happen to me in my life all in all.   there are things that i want to happen  or maybe.  as i told u my friends say i have a tell.  i believe it is true but i dunno.  i just wish that i wasnt so deperate to find a girlfriend...well not so much desperate as well i just want one.  that i let the littlest thing effect me so greatly.  oh well i will just hafta figure this out on my own whatever  >>

       >> another day another dollar  ,   have u ever really thought about that    what does it really mean anyway ,  yes it means u earn money every day if u have a job but what if u dont ,   i was tryin to go to bet but i couldnt because i was thinkin    just thinkin about every thing and this just popped into my head no explaination   it just was there and i couldnt figure it out ,   and another was that my friend is a total papi chulo,    and all i can say is good for him   i mean...(he'll get it)   and y cant i be like that  i have said this to several people and only a few of them can fill in the blanks,     maybe i'll find the nicest prettiest girl ... out.   i always follow that with naaaaaaaa,,   because it is not gonna happen,    i dont  feel really sad  i am just kind   well i am really not anything but any way   it isnt gonna happen because that is just the way the world works   i wish it didnt but whatever that's life     IT'S ALL GOLDEN  as i always say   and that usually holds up  except when i really rip into myself about how much i suck         (vito abe khem  u can back me up on that,   that i do that often)   anyway   life is like a fucked up box of chocolates  u never fuckin know what u r gonna get  >>

       >> life is really strange.    i cant for the life of me figure anything out but the phrase "shit happens"  seems to categorize pretty much everything.     my life is confusing  and i gotta friend who want to go "cruisin on down main street"   but he is afraid.   now if u know me and know how fucked up i am or have just stumbled on this blog and have realized how fucked up i am       damn  if forgot where i was going with that.  but anyway abe was tryin to set me up with sheila which i didnt think was gonna happen and it didnt but who the fuck cares   i mean  IT'S ALL GOLDEN  and if u have read this that is sorta my motto   and another thing my friends say that i have a tell whenever i like a girl.  apparently i talk about them a lot  but i dunno  so what ever.  >>

       >> well yesterday was both a strange and very confusing day.     i was very happy that i was on my way to completely getting over claudie (which i talked about 2 posts ago)     anyway i was talkin to vito and he kept asking me if i liked giselle   and i kept asking him y the fuck he was asking me     it was getting very annoying    anyway i got totally flustered and said i dunno.   but in reality i do like her  IN A STRICTLY PLATONIC WAY  and i kept telling him that but he kept bitching because i had said i dunno.     then abe IM-ed and asked me the same goddamn    now this i couldnt figure out  unless they had been talkin y would they think the same question  abe said the reason was because it seemed like i did and even giselle doesnt think that   and unless she is lying to me i dunno     whatever    fuck it  >>

       >> now as u know yesterday i was absolutely pissed     and i told u the reason was because i still had feelings for claudie   now yesterday this was true because  it just was   now as u know i was infatuated with claudie even after i said i was over her   and i figured out the reason for this   after i realized it was unhealthy i basically forced myself to get rid of my feelings for her.   but as i went to sleep yesterday  i had no clue what to do     now today  i was strangely calm   and i know the reason y     this time it happened naturally and i believe that it really did.   i think that getting my feelings for her all out in the open  may have helped me get over her.    now i still think she is pretty    but i have accepted that nothing will ever happen because she doesnt like and wants to get with cisco    now as i also told u abe is trying to set me up with sheila   and i doubt that will happen because she wants to get with cisco to   but u never know maybe we will get together       maybe       now i have also realized that there is someone out there for me    and it is not claudie   i have no idea who it is   but she will eventually come along  >>

       >> well back to the blog with a kinda new problem.  now a few months ago my friend khem was an asshole and was online with this ugly-ass bitch chelsea pretending to be me.  so chelsea thought i liked her.  now i sure as shit dont and i told her that.  but she kept bugging me on AIM so i blocked her ass.  then her friend talia started buggin me.  and just today she told me that chelsea says high.  now i dont give a shit if she says hi.  i then i told her that i didnt like chelsea.   then...she said that the hi was retracted and that i was an ungrateful person.  now this bitch obviously doesnt know me that well i am because i am  usually  one of the nicest and most gratious people in the in the world.  then i said "fuck u" and then i blocked her.   no they can both go to hell because i am really pissed at both of them and i dont even fuckin know them  >>

       >> It's all golden   I say that all the time    but what does it really mean.   It means that everything that happens is the best thing to happen in the situation   or it means that everything is all good and there are no problems.  Now it may not seem like it is the best thing to happen at the time   but in time everything reveals itself and everything eventually works out.  Now there is no telling when it will show it self but a person must be patient.  Unfortunately that is one thing that I am usually not.  I mean I usually want things to happen now and not have to wait.  Like I want the school year to end now.  And I want a girlfriend now   but unfortunately neither of those things are gone happen anytime soon  >>

IT'S ALL GOLDEN   well i feel that no matter what happens in my life it will all turn out ok    plus no matter what my friends say to me i just dont give a flyin fuck anymore  >>

        >> well let me start off by saying that i am not successful in anything. especially, my success with girls. i am a junior in high school and yesterday was our junior prom. i went with this freshman that i really like. at least i think that i like her. anyway she doesnt like me she likes some other guy. it wouldn't have been as big of a problem had my friends not totally convinced me that she liked me. now i wanted to dance with her as much as i could. she always went to the bathroom and danced with our friends khem and big jack. now i know that i am not that good of a dancer but i tried. anyway later last night we went over to my friend eli's girlfriends house. there eli told me that claudie was feeling some way because she thought that i was being unfriendly and trying to avoid. now this is the exact opposite of what i was trying to do. i really wanted to get to know her better so that maybe she would like me. when i asked her she said she wasn't and later eli said that she had told. so i'm so fuckin confused well it was good to just get all of that out in the open  >>

       >> well life is gettin kinda weird.  Well Vito is movin away and I am gonna miss him.  He is one of my best friends and as odd as this may seem I have never had a friend move away before.  Abe is tryin to get with Maria and good luck with that buddy.  Yesterday I was told that Claudie hated me.  I could understand y that would be because well thats not important.  However when I asked Claudie y she hate me she said she didnt. Now I am totally confused.  Another thing that confused me was that she said I was good looking.  She didnt say this as if she wanted to go out with me but that didnt matter.  The thing was I would like to think she is telling me the truth but no one has ever said that to me in my entire life.  Shit not even me.  I hope she doesnt hate me because I want to stay friends.  Now to get to my recurring theme.  Well I am a nice guy and nice guys finish last.  I think that this is bogus but it seems to be true.  I went out with Sarah that blew up.  I asked Liz out that blew up.  I liked Claudie she didnt like me.  Abe tried to set me up with Sheila that didnt work.  Well thats pretty much all I have to say  >>

Z is still tryin to figure out how.  i was mainly pissed because i thought i was the only one who saw something wrong in what L was doin.  But i found out today that Z and P care as well.  Whats worse is that no matter what happens someone is gonna get hurt.  and that is so depressing.  this is too much goddamn pressure on my back.  it is pushing me lower and lower and lower and lower  untill eventually i cant get any lower and i just snap.  now i dont know what snap means for all i know it will mean that i will get and ulcer.  but who knows all i know is that this shit is tearin me up inside. whats worse R doesnt even know.  this may not make sense to anyone but those who know what i am talkin about may perhaps understand.  >>

        >> Well yesterday I finally met Keli.&nbsp; It only took a month and a half.&nbsp; But it was well worth the wait.&nbsp; I had an awesome time.&nbsp; I just wish I had had more time. &nbsp;To Abe, Vito, or whoever the fuck else is putting that shit in people's chatters I have something to say.&nbsp; Why are we fighting?&nbsp; Is there really any reason?&nbsp; I mean we are all friends here and we dont need to act like children.&nbsp; So in short I am asking you to stop with all of the childish bullshit.&nbsp; Also to Abe I apologize for what I did on the phone last night.  >>

        >> Well hello folks.&nbsp; I just got back from vacation and it wasnt that bad.&nbsp; I had going to Maria's block party and meeting Keli to look forward to.&nbsp; BUT&nbsp; Maria said the guys and I couldnt go because of her parents.&nbsp; Lucky for me, Keli and I talked and we figured it out.&nbsp; So I still have that to wait for.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have to do "forced volunteerism".&nbsp; It wont be so bad,&nbsp;I have had to do it before so it will be no sweat.&nbsp; So after I do that it will be off to meet my destiny.&nbsp; Until next time...  >>

        >>&nbsp; Well I haven't posted in awhile so here is what it going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;About a week ago I told Keli how I really felt about her, and surprise surprise she still liked me.&nbsp;&nbsp; This got me&nbsp;really excited&nbsp;and I knew I had to meet her.&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally will on the 24th of July.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I am worried.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am worried that since we have been talking so much we wont have anything left to talk about, but Keli said I shouldn't be worried.&nbsp; Well I have to go now I will post eventually.  >>

        >> Well I am still with Keli and I am incredibly happy. She is in Wisconsin right now and wont be back until tomorrow afternoon. Abe left for Ohio a few days ago and Khem left yesterday or something. I probably wont see them until school starts again. Well I am gonna go out with Keli again on Saturday BUT I AM NOT TELLING YOU GUYS WHERE WE ARE GOING. Of course the masterminds of the whole Wednesday thing are no longer here. So until I post again.  >>
