         Hello again! Typing again b'cos I'm very bored. Spent virtually the whole night last night trying to figure out how to put pictures into my reports and I had no CLUE. This morning, I just dragged the hearts from my pictures file in my computer. It works well enough for me!  There's nothing better to do right now and I've finished helping my mum clean up the guest roo for some friends coming over. They're from the UK and they're called Sabrina and Daniel. They'll b around for a week then they're going back to the UK. It's always great to c them cos they're good fun.  Will be taking on some fish from my friend Cat because she's leaving. So I've got the tank ready already with the plants and the v. good filter. If you hate fish, look away or you might be scarred for life, or if u actually like Discus fish or want to see what they look like, then here are some pics of different ones:                                                           Ok then, thats all for now! TTFN,    Evernix

         WASSUP!   Bonjour and the like! C-ing how I am a computer freak and spend virtually all my waking hours growing fat on the net, thought that I'd use my time to find something to entertain my readers! I'm gonna put in sum gifs that would be cool for u guys to use if you want. The spiderman wallpaper was drawn and coloured by my borther by  himself! Feel free to use it cos that would be cool too!     If u wanna copy them, here are the steps if you don't already know:     For PC users, its the usual. Right click on the image and the little options bar pops up. Click "Save Image" and save in in a file.       For Mac users, click on the picture and hold until the little bar pops up. Click "save image" and save it in a file.      Hopefully u guys know all of this but for the newbies, just in case ja?     Here they are then!                                Ok then fellows, get copying!  Luv y'all!  Evernix

           Hello people, this is my first blog entry ever and I just wanted to say that if you wonder why I don't use my real name, well, frankly I'd rather not post my real name and that sort of thing on the internet for people I haven't met to read. This link is to my friend Alyce' s blog.             urlLink http://cute_as_candy.blogspot.com/           I thought that hers was cool so I started one of my own :). I'm on summer holidays right now and if you've read my profile, I think that you'd have figured out that I'm not a normal girl because I like comics, playing on the PS2 and I like all the slash hack films. However, I do like boys because I like Luke Mably who was Prince Eddie in The Prince and Me which also happens to be a fantastic movie by itself with good actors and actresses including Julia Stiles who I think was a good choice cos she's a great actress. I used to like Orlando Bloom but thats kinda gone now. He was my longest celeb crush. I like him for about two year. Before that, I kept on changing my mind. James Franco's pretty hot though...;P (Spiderman 1 and 2). Orlando is a a bit of an idiot because he was a highschool dropout and have you read his reviews? The comments he gives are sooooooo stupid. Like "The experience has been crystalized in my heart forever." WHAT!?!?!? How sissy can you get man?  Seeing how these are the summer holidays, I've already visited Pulau Redang which is one of Malaysia's most beautiful islands. I went diving there with my parents, sadly my brother couldn't come along 'cos of his job. I didn't see anything extremely interesting though I did see some interesting animals like cleaner shrimps and file fish. :) I'm going to Bali later near the end of August with my family. My brother has applied for leave and hopefully it will be approved.     Ttfn ("ta ta for now!" in the wise words of Tigger from Winnie the Pooh)  Evernix   urlLink
