      At 6:45am, I got on my bike. Listening  to Peaches on my Ipod,  I rode to meet with the girls at Royal .  Ashley was there too. The sun was out, but the air was cool. We decided to do the RObot ride.We Went up Old Tunnel Rd. I was tired but happy to be back on the bike after 14 consequetive days of work. My pace became slower as we climbed to Grizzley Peak. Then we turned to Claremont for quick descent. The Grove was 15 degrees cooler and my fingers where chilled to the bone. We went back to Roayl for more coffee and conversation. Joe, Peter, Nancy and others stumbled walked in th emorning daze

      Got up called SBC global to change the names on the account and I was pleasantly informed that the DSL would take 12 to 15 days to be reinstalled. Great! Went out to the yard and watered the flowers, the plants, and the cucumbers, no more water for the tomatoes. Its time they get ripe and juicy. At about 9am, I jumped on the train to SF. I decided to ride down to the Pennisula. I went up tp Bean There and remisnest about the time when I could called Don and he would come down and have coffee with me. But not today. I sat there with coffee and no one to talk to. I saw some folks I recognized but they were all rushing to start their days. The counter girl recognized me and let me bring in my bike. That was nice. The weather was so foggy and cold out it was nice to be indoors. Once the caffeine kicked in I jumped backt on my bike. Went thru GG park and felt sad to see all the construction of the new Parking Area. Somehow the  Music Concourse esplanade area seemed lonely and out of date in the midst of the Steinhard aquarium and the new modern museum coming. Once outta of the park, I headed down on Hwy 1 along the coast. I felt free and happy. The ipod played the perfect tunes for this foggy ride( a little Daft punk, John Lennnon, Modest mouse and Flaming lips). It was great ride, until I arrived at Crystal Springs, I had to turn around due to maintenance of the roads. I made back to SF at 1pm, hungry and tired, I went to Urban Forage for  a smoothie, that place kicks veggie booty. I can't wait to find myself there again. I home now ready for disco nap. ciao, p

      So I went to yoga last night at Piedmont studio. I showed up at a Hatha class for beginners taught by Richard Rosen. He was quite good and had a funny sense of humor. Most of the poses were easy yet challenging. We really worked our upper bodies. It felt really good. Lost of downward dog poses too. I can feel it in a arms today. I just got back from a short ride in the hills. The sky was overcast but really warm out. My wool jersey was sweaty and wet when I got home yuk!. So I've started sproutning some garbanzos for my live hummous. Befreo work I gotta water the garden  and go up to Ameaba, I want the new Modest Mouse and Wilco. chao. pp

      Diana called at 7;40, woke my ass up outta bed,Jumped on Bart half conscious and met her, Oliver and Laura at Been there for some coffee and bike ride planning. Skip out on Jodys brunch and Davids BBQ. After sitting around in the sun and two cups of coffee later, we got on our bikes heading  out to Mt Tam. We stopped in at the Tourist's Club for some beers. We got there early so we took in the rays ad ate lots of yummy berries, pretzels and chocolate. Also got a chance to play with Olivers russian camera. At 1;30 Laura and Diana went up to the bar and ordered some beers, which luckily were served to us a little early. Only members get beer before opening. The place is quite beautiful and nestled in the woods above Muir Beach. It has an amazing view of Mt Tam. The beers were cold and sun was shinning. We had a great time. On the way back we shot down the Mountain,like crazy drunk cylcists whirling down Hwy 1. I feel good. I had leftovers for dinner..Its nice to be home. I'm happy summers finally here. ps. I went to really fun partee last night good friends, great live music and yummy pies. I wished I had my camera. darn.

      So I'm feeling kinda shitty today, I'm not really why I feel this way. I guess I recognize, that I need to  make some changes and I'm not sure where to start. I'm ressisting it and its necessary. Its beautiful out. The weather is warm and it finally feels like a summer night. I was supposed to work til 7pm but cut out early.work was depressing. I was hoping to go to Critical mass tonight. But my enthusiasm has faded. I'm sitting here sans plans on a lovely summer night. Myabe I should allow myself to feel this way instead of trying to hide behind a false smile. so here it goes. :(

      Lets see great day today. Woke up the sky was cloudy so I  lingered in bed, read my New yorker. At 9am, I got dressed and went out for a ride. Rode up to Royal ran into some friends. Sat with coffee and slowly woke up. At around ten, I headed up College St, throught the Berkeley Campus up to Cedar. Turned into Tilden went down the hill to Briones Park. Rode up the hill and then down for a great descent. Riding the Bears counter clockwise seemed a lot easier then the usual way. Made back in Orinda and rode bart home.Not bad for 38 miles. By the time I got home I was ready to leave for my haircut. This women named Kri cut my hair. I really like the way she styled it. It turns out shes the owner of Edo Salon. She has nice disposition. Its great having a nice cut. I feel ten times better. My hair was HUGE when I got up this morning. Now its cute and sazzy. Afterwards, I met up with Deneane we walked around the Haight looked at shoes, hats and vintage clothes. We got there kinda late so our time was limited, neither one of us got anything. For dinner I ahd a salad and tea, deneaneate popcornat the theather. We deided to see  Stepford wifes at the Kabuki. The movie was funny at times, but predictable. I don't really like Nicole Kidman but Mathew Broderick's still cute.

      Were going up to Bento Springs today. My stuff is still waitng to be organized, but I must make myself some coffee first. The sky is grey and its hard to know that its rreally summer. Yesterday its was cloudy til about noon, we were so inland the sun had to make an appearance.  all thes incmplete ideas make me want to start over, But theres is little time. So I  guess I'll just make a short entry and write more when I get back. Happy solstice!

      Worked a pretty long shift at the Meadows, but left early to meet Deneane at the Southern Exposure Gallery.They were having a Drwing Rally.  Lots of great artsit producing art on t he spot for $50 bucks a piece. Quite the bargain, but nothing I fancied.  Ran into lots people form my past and present. Karen has gotten hitched since I last saw her. Wow. Afterwards we went to a great new Veggie Restaurant: Urban Forage on Valencia Street. Had a great meal, perfect way to finish my 5 day fast. I feel good and I'm almost tempted to continue  my fast but I'd like to do along bike ride tomorrew with my posse. So I guess it will wait. On thursday night I won some free ticketson KLAX  to see Asylum Streets Slickers, so we went to to 12 Galaxies to meet up Mike, Dustin and Company. It was fun but the scene was bit restricted, everyone sat thru the set and it lacked energy. We left. I'm home  ready to fall inot my cama. Hasta manana, chao. p

      So, I've been fasting the last three days. I'm mainly having juices and protein shakes and some fruit and raw veggies. I still have my morning coffee. It feels really good. And I don't feel tired. I remember fasting 4 yrs ago, and it was really challenging. I may extend my fast a few days later. I'm noticing how sugar affects me. The other night, I had a llittle bit of peanut sauce on piece of tofu and few minutes later, I felt a rush of energy flowing through my veins, It was bizarre. I should really monitor how much sugar I consume. But I love sweets. Bread/pastries are evil too. Working at the Flower shop we are constantly rtepmted with goodies from La Farine.  I've been sticking to my carrot juice or mango slices. I notice drinking water really helps.   More to come.   Must get ready and go to the Meadows. happy thursday!

      I woke up early as usual and rode up to the Cafe to meet my friend Melissa. We sat with our coffees and watch the world come to live. One by one, our friends came around. First Cat rode up on her Bianchi and chatted a bit. She wore cool pink cords and a cute black cardigan. Then Derrick crossed the street with his curly locks looking confident and self assured. The sun was shining and the hills looked inviting. At about 7:30,we left the cafe for a short ride rode  our usual route, up Old tunnel to grizzly  Peak and down thru Claremont. It was so warm climbing that at times, I felt like removing my wool jersey along with my retro wool socks that came half way up my calf. The view was amazing, although it looked a bit smog down by Lake Merrit. San Francisco sat in hazy bank of clouds. The sky was deep blue and the sun was really heating up. I felt good and everything seemed equally nice. After our descent we went back to Royal for more morning slacking. Another cup of coffee and more friends to greet. Its time fro me to get off the computer and resume my daily responsibilities.

      After fine night at Zeigeist I arrived home late and collapsed into a deep slumber. Overslept through my alarm and missed my friend for an early morning ride up the Oakland hills. Now I'll write few sentences and go attend my garden, before the weather heats up again. My tomatoes are finally turning up. This year I planted some cherry tomatoes, along with the usual" Early moning girl" and "Beefsteak". Last year my crop was so pletnitfl, that I spent the later days of September canning and eating tomotes three times a day.  I also have green beans, cucumbers, and kale. I forgot about my artichokes and now I have none. Oh well. Next winter I will try to keep a better schedule.

      I can't believe its June14th already. I'm happy though, I like staying busy. This next week should be pretty predicatble. I just completed six days of jewelry stylling for a client from Colorado. The work was tedious and hard. I felt challenged this time around.  Today I'm at home organizing my life. paying bills, gardening and shopping for groceries. Tonight some friends and I will be at Zeigeist for the summer film festival. I enjoy hanging out at Zeigeist. the scene, the beers and the flicks. more to come.

      I just woke  up from an afternoon nap. I went to the dentist today and had to have a root canal. I had been having some awful sharp pain in my upper molar and knew it was going to be serious. Lucky for me, that I have a good friend who was able to do it for me. I came home and I slept most of the afternoon . I woke feeling like it was tomorrow morning. My boss was calling and the phone was ringing. I alsmost got fully dressed until I realized that its still thursday evening. I feel relieved, I  can have a snack and maybe read my book tonight:. Michael Moore's "Stupid White Men". So thats ala for now signing off.

      But very short. It started early friday afternoon, as I was finishing my current project. Birte my friend and colleague sent her assistant out to pick a few six packs of our favorite beer, Stella Artois. We shared a few bottles. Later, I left to meet up with my pals: Mike and Oliver.  We had dinner at sobar on 2nd Street. Got home rather early but it was nice to have the place to myself. I took a bath and got ready for work the next morning. Saturday started early again. I was on my bike at 6:30 and was sipping my coffee by 7am. Patrick arrived a little late, which worked out fine. I worked til noon and went home to receive my friends. Jody was great, she arrived early and was prepping some food for our bbq. I made pizza, hummus and veggies, fruit salad,soba with grilled veggies, and bougth some spopicy salad. Natalie and Jason arrived next with Tequila on hand. Cat and Jim made presciuto with melon. Reuben, Melissa, Jon, Christina, Paul, Ashley, Sam, Justin, and others showed up.

      I got up today and  I had the worst tooth ache, lucky for me the art director I'm working with gave me a few painkillers. But later I discovered, I tookone too many. I spent most of the morning in a haze.  I called Darren and  he may see me onM onday until th en I hace some Ubuproffin to keep the pain away. I wish I had some thing for my heartache. ;( more on that later. The day was over soon, and I sped off on my bici listening to PJ harveys new one. I felt a lot better as I zipped through the Mission. Made it back to the Beast and went to Market hall picked up a nice bottle of wine and some dinner items. Came home cooked some dinner sipped wine,and relaxed. Its nice to have a nice mellow place to live. thank u.

      I've had the pleasure of working with a sensible and funny young man. He's funny and it makes the whole working process go so smooth. The work has been easy but my days are tooo long. I leave at 7:20 am and come home twelve hours later. I enjoy taking the shuttle into the city. Riding my bici thru China Basin and around SBC park. Usually the area is empty and I get to enjoy the early morning serenity. Last night after work, I went to see one of my favorite bands play at the Palace of fine arts; The Magnetic Fields. It was a nice evening. We met and had dinner at Urban forage, shared a bottle of Merlot. Once we got to the Marina, we drove around a lot, but finally fund a spot close by.  The lovers argued about petty things and I walked ahead enjoying my surroundings. The sun was setting and I rushed trying not to miss the band. Once in the lobby we quickly met Karri, we chatted, drank wine and watched the fashionable crowd walk in.  A couple of glasses of wine later. It was time to go in. Only four band members were on stage. I was mesmerized the music was pure and I cried, the first four songs where too much. The lyrics were wirtten for me. the Music touched me. I was moved. It was amazing. I arrived at home after midnight and  quickly fell sleep. woke up early and walked to Bart. and went to work. I 'm home again ready for bed. tuto , pp

The climbs were steep and hard.  Jody came by ealry and shared some coffee and tour talk.. These past  days have been a  blur of events. Thursday I prop shopped.The evening was hot, so I  met Deneane, Chris and Jody for dinner and drinks at Dona Tomas. the yummiest mexican food around..Thanks for the margaritas Paul!  Yesterday, I was in the studio getting ready for the upcoming Gumps shoot. Four days to complete a 12 page book. Its gonna be tight. But I have it under control. Were ready.  Last night was amazing. Jody, Natalie and I went to the Kabuki gardens spa. Where we soaked, steamed and relaxed. I felt like brand new person. Later we met Diana, Dave and Abbie for dinner in Japantown. Afterwards Karri, Dave, Diana and Abbie walked over to the fillmore to see Neko Case. She was amazing, to watch her sing and perform some of my favorite songs was a real treat.  We also manage to  be front center stage. Calexico played well too, but they're not my favorite so I left early. Came home, collapsed in mi cama. and this morning I woke up at the crack of dawn...watched the tour....woohoo!!!Go Lance!!!

I wore wool and my cool striped wool socks.  I arrived home at noon. and made myself some lunch. Spinach salad ala pamela with feta, tofu, tomatoes, olives and Goddess dressing. yummy. chai tea and a piece of chocolate for dessert. I need the caffeine...

      I woke up really early today. Packed my bag and went out for a before work ride. I got to the cafe and Jason, Melissa, Paul and Reuben were downing their coffees and ready to sprint. Jody was little late, but it gave me some time to ride up Claremont, before they caught me. Melissa is a powerhouse! damn... even after her short injury last week, she manages to fly up the hill. Reuben complained about the pace and almost crashed into me. At that point, I was just riding and trying to keep up. Huffing and puffing, I was dropped. Made me feel a little insecure and thougth about the times when I used to drop others. Wow. I feel like I may never be as fit as I was a couple of years ago. But I'm not giving up. I will continue to ride even if its by myself. I just gotta do it.  After descending, I went to work avec les fleurs. I went to the flower Market in Sf and delivered some flowers to a photo shoot. Afterwards, I stopped by Truly Med, for a truly yummy falafel. Came back to Oaktown and everyone was asking me where I got that falafel..  Apres midi au'jourdui, Watched a little of the tour this afternoon (Le tour de France), It so exciting, I always get shivers watching it. I can't wait til the hightlights later. Oh, gotta work on updating my website tonight, Its about time. just wait. It really  needs a make over. au'voir mos amis, Allez! Allez!

      Hi ya'll I'm back from the river. Mike, Karri and I left saturday morning and headed north up 101. Half way up there, Mikes car started overheating. Once in Healdsburg the car was smoking and we realized we needed help. Thanks to Karri we were able to call triple A. They quickly came to our rescue. Luckily, it was only the waterhose that needed replacement. Three hours later, after lounging by the river and sipping white wine, we were able to get back on the road. We made it to the creek at about 11pm. We made a quick snack and set up our sleeping bags. The next morning, we packed our backpacks and hiked down to the river. A few miles later we met up with Jason and Natalie who had discovered a great spot for us to camp in. Next to the river with lots of great swimming holes.The rest of the weekend was spent swimming, hiking, lounging in the sun and eating lot of yummy food. oh yeah and lots of poison oak. I've got it. I'm itchy now.  see photos: http://www.monkeyview.net/id/192/travel/eel_/index.vhtml

      So, its been kinda of a hectic day. First of all, I woke up with a hang over. I drank one too many glasses of wine last nigth. Thanks Cat for a fun evening full of great wine|!conversation, fire and fun folks. Then I had to reorder my dsl and that was an ordea. Jerome and I came close to just setting with some other provider. Luckily he was able to talk some sense to them.  About noon I went on a "Robot ride". It was so hot I had to take off all my layers. My bike was making a wierd noise too. I hate mechanical disfunctions. Then I rode back by the Meadows and our boss forgot to sign out petty checks. UggHH!  I rode home and got ready to head to SF, where I needed to pickup my Polaroid back for my 4x5 camera. I bought some film and polaroid and ready to continue working on my landscapes. Yea for me .Big pat on the shoulder. It was so hot walking around the Mission that I just sat most of the afternoon reading the ZNew Yorker and sipping Ice chai tea.Later, I'm meeting Deneane for dinner at Urban Forage. I love that place. I need some healthy food to make up for all the cheese I ate last night oh yeah and the two cigarettes I smkoed.yuk.Have fun see you next tuesday. I'll be going up to the Eel river this week end for some fun in the sun. :)   Heres to America the beautiful Go see Michael Moores,film its an eye opener for some. I knew that monkey boy was up to no good. Rich m*ther f*cker.

      At 6:45, I woke up to the phone ringing. It was Jody, she had driven her parents to the ariport and was up early. We agreed to meet for coffee. and  I got ready for a morning ride afterwards. It was nice to take my time and ride up to the Cafe. I had a yummy soy au lait. I met Jody and we chatted outdside petting all the dogs around. The sky was grey a nd the hills were covered in fog. I managed to get a 25 mile ride in. I came home and cleaned the rest of the closet took some stuff to GW and went to the farmers market. I love that market. I picked up some onion garlic sprouts, ice queen nectarines, avocados, baby lettuce, cucumbers, jalapenos and corn tortillas.  I plan to make some avocado, cucmber soup with lime and jalapenos. Yummy...tomrrow I'm gonna drive to moraga topick some pears. i eally want to make some Pear compote. mmm..chao.,
