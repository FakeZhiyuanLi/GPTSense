      Man... I don't know if someone should congratulate me or kick my ass because of what marks I got. So I went yesterday to check out my marks, and all through the way I kept saying to myself 'please let it be  atleast  500; please let it be  at least  500'. And to my surprise when I check the result, it is BLOODY 500 ONLY!!! Man all I needed was 10 more marks and I would have gotten a  B !! I'll have to settle with a C+. Awe Man!!! Just my luck!!  So anyways I was so devastated by the results that even when everyone told me that, I'm very lucky to get 500 especially in the new syllabus, that didn't cheer me up at all. And to top it all off, my mood was so down that when me and my brother were playing StarCraft(alliance), for the first time the bloody computer actually started to beat us!!  Oh well, I still found some time to work v2 or as I like to call it Phase II of my site. You know to up lift my spirits a bit. The sites turning out very nice. I've managed to add a skinning option, it doesn't do much though. I'll let you know when I finish it. Until then why don't you check out my current site it's  urlLink http://haiderali.cjb.net/ .

      I haven't written anything in my journal for quite some time now. Mainly because as you can see I've chosen  urlLink Blogger  to the manual journal I had before. You see, this post of mine is very awkward for me. Mainly because today is the day I finally find out, after 3 months of torture, my final examination results.  You might think I'm over reacting but this is big stuff. If I fail this exam then the course of my entire future will be jeopardized. I'll have to think of a new future for myself according to my results. I could do the exam again but that would be wasting another two years. I guess I'll have to live with what I got.  I got terrible marks in the first half of the examination so everything now depends upon this result. If I cross 500, okay I might have a chance at a steady future but anything less would be a humiliation and it would be change my entire life.  Ok I guess that's enough sadness and emotional stuff for now. I have enough problems as it is with this exam and trying to remember my roll number, because that's the only way I can find out my result! The darn thing was like a telephone number! I remember 170###, the # is unknown! So I've got a lot of thinking to do.  Oh well I guess it's time for me sign out now. Until the next post, that is if anyone reads this crap, cheerio.

      Yo, long time no type. I've been pretty busy the past few days, didn't get any time to write here. So anyways, my site is turning out awesome. Hopefully in a week I'll be done with it and have uploaded it. The main reason why I've been so busy is that it took me some time to get a couple of my sites pages working on a count of them having a lot of JavaScript in them. They're working great.  Plus I've also found some time to play a little Photoshop Pong on a few forums. My first match was, infact still is, versus OlssenE of  urlLink The Asylum . He mysteriously vanished in between the game but cam back with not much of a challenge. You can see my bout with him here:   urlLink Templar654 vs OlssenE   Another match of mine is against Arendje of  urlLink GF . This guy seems to be a pro, his serves are pretty darn good. But they're still no match for the Tempster! Watch my bout with him here:   urlLink TemplarXT vs Arendje   Well that's a wrap for this post till the next, God Speed and keep your Mom happy!

      Forth entry in the journal. It was pretty belated, I apologize for that to anyone who enjoys reading this crap!  I couldn't write here on account of because where I live (Pakistan) you have to by internet in pre-paid cards. They're reasonable, you get 10 hours for a 100 and so on. The problem was that mine was finished. I didn't find the time to go and get a new one.  Oh well, I finally found a college I liked. It's a little far from my home but I guess I'll just have to get on one bus to get there. The place is nice, home-y, friendly you get the picture. Over all it's a great place!! I mean it's not like those stupid colleges here that will give you admissions on things like religious knowledge or sports! That's right here if you compete in any sporting activity and win you get an admission in that college with a few discounts!! I have a friend who is so much complexed with this one college that he's willing to go through wrestling just to get an admission there!! I mean hey if you need to go through that much trouble just to get into a stupid college then to Hell with that institution.  I guess I better steer away from that topic before I get emotional. On to my site now. I'm getting some progress in my site but I still have some difficulties with Mozilla/FireFox. I guess I'll have to as it over at the  urlLink Asylum (great guys!). These guys seem to know everything! Oh well catch you later.

      I wasn't able to write in my journal the last few days. Mainly because I've been out college hunting. Where I live there are over 700 colleges in this state alone. And almost each one turns out to be better than the last but at the same time also has several flaws. Like for instance. There's this college here called the Leads College of Excellency. Beautiful campus, nice classrooms, great garden but the auditorium, computer lab, library and cafeteria are all in the basement! A guys gonna spend half his college life in the Library and Lab the place at least should have some direct sunlight!   It was very hard to decide which one to pick as they all were good but at the same time they all had many flaws. Anyways, recently I started work on my site's version 2. The work is progressing at a steady pace and I expect it be complete in a week or so. Other than that nothing much happened, every since I got my results things have been very eerily quiet...
