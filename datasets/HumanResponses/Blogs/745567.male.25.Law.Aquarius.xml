      Saw TMBG in Prospect Park in Brooklyn for free last night.  Was reminded that the Johns wrote one of the greatest lines ever: "I'm interested in things."  And was reminded of just how solid their live show really is.

      I threw three Monkey Throw Feces songs up on  urlLink CNET's mp3.com replacement .  And look, we're  urlLink beating  David Cross with 211 downloads to his 137.  This with only two days head start.  Amazing.

      I watched a 1972 Lawrence Olivier film last night called "Sleuth."  Suffice to say, it was not very good.  But beyond that, having now seen two Lawrence Olivier films (the other being Rebecca), I've come to the conclusion that the good Baron really isn't that good an actor.  Perhaps it is just a function of the era in which I was born--in which an actor actually tries to portray a character realistically, instead of playing a pompous orator with a couple of nervous ticks meant to represent the character--but I'm here and now starting a movement to stop revering Lawrence Olivier and his hammy kin.  Join me?

      Why on Earth is this so hard for media pundits to get?  I was listening to Air America (I know, I know), and this guy was chastising the pharmaceutical companies for charging Americans more than foreigners for the same drugs.  He correctly pointed out the safety argument is bunk, but failed to recognize there is a very good reason other than greed.  Or, at least, not greed in the sense he thinks of it.  If the U.S. allows consumers to import their drugs from Canada or Nigeria, what is going to happen?  The drug companies are going to stop selling their products at a discount in Canada and Nigeria.  Which means Joe American stops getting to buy cheap drugs, and must go back to the domestic prices.  Fine.  But what happens to Joe Canada or Joe Nigeria?  Joe Canada and Joe Nigeria must start buying drugs at or closer to the American price.  Neither cannot afford the higher price.  Both now die sooner, because they cannot afford the drugs they need.  And here's the kicker.  Because the drug companies are forced to drastically reduce their sales base--because only countries with residents with enough money to purchase at American prices will actually buy--the American price will actually  go up .  So everybody loses.  I'm no economist.  I don't know whether, if we start allowing drugs to get shipped over international borders, this will actually happen.  But it isn't as stupid or as simple as some pundits are making it out to be.

      Just watched the film version of  urlLink Cabaret , and I have to say I wasn't that impressed.  The music was good, but not that good.  The entire production stank of the 70s: overexposing every other shot, using sloppy camera angles, and using rapid editing in excess of good taste.  Liza is more odd looking than attractive.  But mostly, I think I was bothered by the you're-gay-because-you-haven't-fucked-the-right-woman mindset.  Even when it doesn't work out between Liza and M. York, it is because deep down he isn't a party guy, not because deep down he likes to suck cock.  It is a shame that American cinema was still treating homosexuality like a fetish in 1972.  I suppose it is more of a shame that it still does.

      Why is the word "binocular," and not "biocular?"  Where did the "n" come from?

      On January 8th, according to  urlLink SurveyUSA ,  urlLink Howard Dean would have been endorsed by Iowa  with 25-34% of the vote.  On January 20th, the day after the Iowa Caucuses,  urlLink Iowa chose John Kerry , leaving Howard Dean with only 18% of the votes.  One possible read on this is that of the 100,000 to 125,000 Iowans that participated in the caucuses, somewhere between 7000 and 20,000 Iowans changed their minds between January 8th and January 19th.  This is possible, of course.  But isn't the more rational conclusion to reach is that SurveyUSA screwed up?  Perhaps its survey methods are flawed; perhaps its survey methods were corrupted; perhaps its statisticians are pranksters.  Perhaps--and here's what I'm really getting out--there isn't really all that strong a correlation between what people say on the phone and what they do in the voting booth.  The Howard Dean "fall" is just an example.  The news is riddled with many examples of supposed "sea changes" or "about faces" in public opinion  that may never have happened .  Isn't it more likely that for every time a whole bunch of people went from being adamantly opposed to Issue X to being adamantly for Issue X, there are ten more times where the pollsters just didn't find truth through the telephone in the first place?  Isn't it more likely that Howard Dean was  never  the front-runner?

      I went to this New Brunswick bar last night with a few people.  The bar was called J &amp; J's or something.  It replaced this placed called My Three Sons, which was good only for package goods; sort of seedy and unhip.  On the way in, I see this guy, Joe Davicson, who lived in my freshman year dorm, and who inadvertently pushed my current girlfriend of nearly seven years into my arms in the first place.  See, he kept hitting on her, because she was single; he was so creepy, she came to me, who was also hitting on her, but less creepy.  I thought about saying hello to Joe, but decided against it.  He likely doesn't have as fond memories of me as I do of him.  So we get to the back room of the bar, where the dancing is going on, and there is this guy dancing.  Dancing obnoxiously, and with anyone he could, including yours truly.  Usually when people have bad teeth, it is because they have too many.  This guy had too few.  Not like he lost some in a fight or due to rot.  He just had spaces between his teeth.  Spaces so large that flossing becomes an adventure.

      My brother and I started  urlLink Monkey Throw Feces  a few years back.  We had a few songs on the pre-CNET mp3.com.  We had a few fans.  Well, at least one.  This guy  urlLink emailed us , asking where he could purchase a MTF tee.  So I created a  urlLink CafePress shop , then pointed him there.  Then I promptly forgot about it.  The other day, I remembered it.  And went and looked.  Apparently, this one fan bought  three  shirts.  So there is this guy wandering around Florida wearing Monkey Throw Feces shirts  several times per week .  And I have three dollars and three cents sitting in a CafePress account.  Meaning I'm only 22 more shirt sales (or, at the current rate, roughly eight more fans) from seeing an actual check.  Amazing.  And all I did was throw together a few images.  So now I've decided to speed things up.  I put up a  urlLink Yodelling Llama Shop  as well.  With a frisbee and a sticker.  Everybody loves stickers.  Especially ones that encourage fellow drivers to "Stop Breeding!"  And I'm working on putting together a Monkey Throw Feces album.  Which explains the image at the MTF shop.  What is not yet understood is why Pop Song #42 is not uploadable.  CafePress' tech people have been most unhelpful.  Oh well.

      I have a confession.  I was a Howard Dean fan.  From pretty early on.  Certainly before anyone was calling Dean the presumptive nominee, which itself was before anyone actually voted in a primary.  I was a Dean fan because, despite how portrayed in the media, Dean was a moderate.  A fiscal moderate--who actually believed in figuring out where the money is going to come from (something neither Kerry nor Bush seems concerned with)--and a foreign policy moderate--who actually believed in waging war when  necessary .  So after Dean dropped out and endorsed Kerry, and after  urlLink Dean for American  morphed into  urlLink Democracy for America , I looked to see what there was for me to do.  What have I leaned?  Not much.  DFA paints itself as an organization.  It is not.  It does not provide as many concrete goals or activities that individuals can accomplish.  It is more of a way to meet like-minded individuals, and there you can figure out what to do.  Fine.  But it isn't even as effective as  urlLink Meetup  at accomplishing that very limited function.  Oh well.  At first I was bothered by DFA's reference to its fora as "forums."  So I checked.  And  urlLink Merriam-Webster  agreed with the DFA folks.  Apparently, the English language was butchered into allowing "forums" as an alternate pluralization so long ago that it is now an accepted form.  Fuckers.  What next bothered me is that my suggestions regarding the  urlLink Nader candidacy  and  urlLink gay marriage  (look for posts by  yllama ) were not even addressed.  I mean, what is wrong with these people that they don't even ridicule a stupid idea, or fawn over a good idea, or critique a flawed idea, or whatever you want to call it?  But then I became less of a whining bitch, and realized that no one cares about ideas.  Especially when they are old hat.  These people just want to bicker amongst themselves and accomplish nothing.  Fine.  But in the end, that is all I want to do as well.  Bickering is what makes life worth living, no?  So who am I to criticize, just because they want to bicker about something different?

      A few months ago, a few other fellow alumni from The Medium got together to do something like YL.  So was born  urlLink Not The Onion .  NTO has about the same appealing lack of site design that YL has, about the same quality of writing, and an even more unfortunate name, if that is possible.  I posted  urlLink a few things  at first, before realizing that it was going nowhere.  It gets almost as few hits as YL, and with many more writers.  What a glorious mistake.

      YL is down right now.  I'm not sure why, and it is pissing me off.  I was going to post a new review to  urlLink The Day the Earth Stood Still , a somewhat campy old s/f film from right after the end of the cold war.  And I'm being prevented from doing so.  Oh well.

      I'm getting to a late start, but in the grand tradition of  urlLink Slumbering Lungfish , I've decided that  urlLink Yodelling Llama  needs a blog.  In case you are unaware, YL is my pet humor site that I started shortly after leaving the warm embrace of college and the humor newspaper  urlLink The Medium .  So why a separate blog?  Sometimes I have random thoughts that don't fit with the YL format.  And sometimes I want to call attention to changes on YL.  Why not just create a subdomain?  Because  urlLink 1 &amp; 1  has been glitchy lately, and if I have everything hosted in one place, and the server goes down, I'm without recourse.  Welcome.

      New news satire up.  Called  urlLink Kansas to Ban Sterile Marriage .  Sparked by a conversation I had with this guy who thought marriage was about procreation, and that was his primary objection to gay marriage.  Enjoy.

       urlLink Monkey Throw Feces  wrote and recorded three new songs today, each more excellent than the last.   urlLink David Mamet  is a fairly straightforward song about the playwright and director.   urlLink Sad Pop Song  is a more melodic and generally sad version of  urlLink Pop Song #42  with a bonus six seconds, dedicated to The Cure cover bands.   urlLink Acoustic/Electric  is the result of a broken cable, a short cord adapter, an unexpectedly high level of feedback, and some acoustic chords.  Enjoy.

      I always loved Choose Your Own Adventure books.  They were simultaneously terrible and wonderful.  I attempted  urlLink one  a few years back.  It was Halloween themed.  So, sticking to tradition, when I got the itch to write another CYOA this (technically yesterday) morning, I found a holiday.  On  urlLink Wikipedia .  Useful.  What I ended up coming up with--and using--was the "Transfiguration Bank Holiday."  I gather that it is 1) a holiday, 2) celebrated in El Salvador, 3) a bank-closing holiday, and 4) a  religious  holiday.  The last is based on my minimal religious training which, I believe, involved the term "transfiguration" at some point.  So this morning, I wrote a CYOA, set in El Salvador.  It involves both religion  and  bank closures as plot motivators.  It also involves, I hope, some humor.  And of course, as with any good CYOA-for-adults, it involves sex and violence.  Disturbing sex and violence.   urlLink Enjoy .

      Rush puts on a good show.  I saw them about two years ago and enjoyed myself.  I enjoyed myself more this time, despite the introduction of a number of cover songs to the set.  Why?  Rain.  It poured for roughly four songs during the first set.  Which made us wet, uncomfortable, and cold.  It sucked, yes; but it was awesome.

      Watched  urlLink The Bourne Supremacy  last night.  Enjoyable enough.  But for some reason the new director, a guy by the name of  urlLink Paul Greengrass , seems to have decided that to make his movie more "authentic" or "real" or "good," he'd cherry pick from  urlLink Dogme 95 's  urlLink Vow of Chastity .  Looked like nothing but on location shooting, albeit with numerous props.  Looked like the film took place "here and now."  And it looked like most of the film was done with a hand-held.  Why?  It certainly couldn't have been that he was trying to create a Dogme film.  It was a genre picture, it had a great deal of "superficial" violence, it had outside music.  Perhaps someone should buy this Paul Greengrass a tripod and stop distracting us.

      The webmaster of  urlLink Not The Onion --a gentleman named  urlLink Michael Molino --emailed me to complain about  urlLink my characterization of NTO .  He said, "You claim that with more writers, we get less hits," and demanded an apology.  Seeing how I never said this, I refuse to apologize.  What I said was, "It gets almost as few hits as YL, and with many more writers."  When I use the "almost as few" construction, I am implying that the former has  more  than the latter.  To imply otherwise is to fail to demonstrate a mastery of the English language.  Perhaps Mr. Molino was objection to my characterization of NTO as getting "almost as few" hits as YL because it implies a certain closeness in the numbers.  He did send me NTO's unique visitors chart from July.   urlLink     I also obtained YL's unique visitors chart from July.   urlLink     As you can see, NTO  did  have more unique visitors than YL during July.  I am not disputing that.  But they don't look as disparate as all that to me.  The NTO scale runs from 0 to 180; the YL scale runs from 0 to 160.  Yes, NTO does seem to have a more plateau shape than YL (although the deep valley in the middle was caused by 1 & 1's server going down, not a dry spell).  But come on.  Is this really worth bickering about?  Well, Mr. Molino?

      I'm going to visit my  urlLink friend in Texas  in about a week.  I'm supposed to bring her cat.  The few people I've told have been mortified, and have forewarned the loose-in-the-car cat--who doesn't really know or like me--will jump on my head, causing a horrible accident.  So I'm apologizing in advance to those between Scotch Plains, NJ--where I am picking up the feline--and Austin, TX--where the feline's owner now lives--that if they are maimed in a horrible automobile accident involving a green Saturn from Idaho.

      The West Wing has its second season out on DVD.  Actually, it has probably been out for some time, but it has just recently started to dominate my  urlLink Netflix  queue.  I remembered what turns out to have been the  urlLink second "Big Block of Cheese" episode  from when it first aired, but it was good to give it another look-see.  CJ had a run-in with what promised to be a humorous and ridiculous band of "merry men" from a fictional group called "Cartographers for Social Equality," or something.  So they put up the  urlLink Peters Map , which is basically another two dimensional representation of a three dimensional object, but this one with a better characterization of relative areas.  Which I guess is a serious social issue.  But I always preferred the  urlLink da Vinci  or  urlLink Buckminster Fuller  ways of avoiding excessive stretching with scissors.  So much more satisfying.

      Returned to the Jersey Shore last night, primarily to have a few drinks at  urlLink a tiki bar .  After waiting on line for twenty minutes, getting carded by a police officer, paying $10 to get in, we still got watered-down drinks in a too-crowded atmosphere, all the while subjected to a near-parodic cover band that had a horrendous version of "Sweet Home Alabama"  mingling with the more expected Michael Jackson feints.  Disappointed?  You could say that.
