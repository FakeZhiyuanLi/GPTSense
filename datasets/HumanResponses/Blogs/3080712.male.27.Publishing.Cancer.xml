       	 		 		 You see, this is what happens when an intruder encroaches upon an elephant seal's domain. While you or I might frown upon the practice of keeping a gigantic seal harem, you cannot just go and steal another man's wooman, M'K?  So, imagine my displeasure at the discovery of a number of pretenders to the Real Seal Deal. While  urlLink this  little number appears largely innocent fun, there is a far worse presence lurking on the dark side of the web.  Now, reasonable people might consider that leopard prints are suitable only for Essex girls and Ford Focus drivers from Leeds. Not so  urlLink this  paean to leopard seals, which is a large tank on my lawn. Well Daddy's got a fire bomb, M'K? 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink IMG_0214 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink Gringcorp .

       	 		 		 Wiliam Randolph Hearst, instigator of the Spanish-American war, newspaper publisher, and all-round carved wood collector, might seem to be an odd inspiration for adorable elephant seals.  Yet, just below his Califnornian castle (it's actually a Ranch, named after the salad dressing), the elephant seals frolic in a convincing echo of his notorious 1920s house parties.  Although I might say that the sheer number of chicks here is better than Willie, or indeed anyone other than male model Fabio, has ever achieved. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink IMG_0212 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink Gringcorp .

      We've all (those without cable have no rights) got used to the smiling cheery aboot-spewing mush of Pat Kiernan on  urlLink NY1 . I'm starting to think that the host of "In The Papers Is Sponsored By Sleepys The Mattress Professionals Home Of The Incredible Price Guarantee" might be getting sucked up in his own counter-culture cred.   All hail, then, the station's newest star - TV reviewer Dalton Ross. Ross, a reviewer at  urlLink Entertainment Weekly , already has a following through his print work - see  urlLink here .  On the telly, he looks like an amiable, rather grim, corpse-chewer, and even, maybe, has a little of the "slack-jawed hipster", as  urlLink Michael  might say, about him. But he's sound, very funny, while at the same time holding a proundly depraved view of man's nature. Still, I guess endless viewing of Fox realty series will do that to you. Whatever, he kicks the ass of Owen  Gleiberman, or god forbid, Neil Rosen, the movie critics who pollute NY1.

      Just been going through the Observer's comment, and read Will Hutton's  urlLink piece  on Bush and the US, mostly because I assumed it was going to be another a rant about how superior the European social democratic model is. I happen to share that view, but feel that Hutton has again misunderstood the American experience. I have always felt that the conservatives here, when railing at the innovations introduced by the New Deal, did have a point. These  were  innovations, and I'm never sure they properly bedded down. It is worth noting that the most positive American interventions abroad conincided with the high point of credibility for New Deal economics. Its decline dovetailed neatly with the decline in the credibility of the US overseas. This faith in individualism and disdain for the state predates the neocons, is evident in Thomas Paine, and explains the thinking behind the Monroe Doctrine.   By the same token, Eastern Europeans in the 1980s adored the American example, and Kuwaiti teenagers called George do exist, so the model is rarely universal.

      Speechless with rage at American Airlines (no link needed, as you'll know if you are either a recovering drunk or a British car enthusiast) - one cancelled flight, one broken down plane, and one lost reservation in the course of 24 hours. Top work. Fervent prayers they go the way of United and US Air although I must say their staff are quite pleasant while going about being awe-inspringly incompetent.  Big up to the Chicagy Gay Pride parade, although the screaming cops were a little jarring. I know the New York Cops have this reputation for being a little evol, but they have tended to be largely silent and deadly recently. But the Chicagy cops are super-badass, and really give you a mouthful. I think the spirit of '68 still resides in them. Speaking of massive police intemperance, did you see that William Bratton has decided to look at whether it is a good idea for cops to  urlLink beat people up with flashlights ? Looks like he's got a harder job than we thought cleaning that force up. Even Rudi did not have to weigh in with a "no broomsticks" rule.

      Lukey D.'s  urlLink quite obviously biased cuttlefish-dissing site  has the Brooklyn Bridge as the number three bridge of all time,  behind the rather insipid Sydney Bridge. This despite the fact that  urlLink Sydney  is quite plainly a rather simple minded scam to sell more opera tickets, and as a structure is rather derivative of the  urlLink Tyne Bridge . The Tyne Bridge takes you to Gateshead. Whoopy Do. In fact, the only bridge that comes close to the mighty Brooklyn Bridge is the  urlLink Humber Bridge , and that only because it beat the  urlLink Verrazano Bridge  in a fair fight, and even then it only makes it to number 2. So don't go ranking bridges when you don't have yer foundations. M'K?

      Slate's William Saletan is all  urlLink huffy  at criticism of his Kerryisms column. Here's some more - they're boring and illuminate nothing. The idea proceeds from the assumption that Bushisms are anything more than cheap laughs at POTUS' mangling of the mother tongue. Or Jacob Weisberg's summer house. Stop it. Please

      So, I went to the home opener of the mighty urlLink  Brooklyn Cyclones  , and they manged to fart and stumble their way to a 4-3 win over the Upstarts from Upstate, the Hudson Valley Renegades.  (Speaking of upstate idiots, the  urlLink  Beer Drinking Fools   are playing their last show ever at the Acme Underground in NYC Friday. A couple of months back they were being heckled about coming from Schenectady, and took it badly, depsite it being utterly untrue. Still, troopers and all that)  Single A baseball is super-kewl, despite being a pet project of Mayor G, although home runs are as rare as rocking horse doo-doo. It also has ultra-rare ads that you never see up in the more rarified sections of Brooklyn, as well as namechecks for neighborhoods you never hear mentioned on  urlLink  NY1   . And somehow the fact that   everything   is for sale just makes it more charming, unlike the Nextel call to the bullpen on MLB games, or whatever. Probably because the businesses are mostly more niche. Although the poor Hudson Valley designated hitter probably did not want to be forever associated in the minds of the Coney baseball afficionados with Papa John's pizza.   Final rant. Those Ed Koch "Be nice to the Republicans when they come into town" ads. Did anyone do any marketing research into whether jumping up and down like a meth-loco gibbon at poor people from Texas asking for directions was a good response? There are some people who would only be elected in NY, and scare the holy f***ing crap out of mortals. Trust me.

      The easy response to Christopher Hitchen's  urlLink attack   on  urlLink  Michael Moore's new film   is to note that the (in my opinion amazing) Trials of Henry Kissinger played at the Film Forum on Houston Street, while Fahrenheit 911 is likely to be bringing in the pimps and okies from off of Times Square.  But you could also answer quite a few of his points from the detached elitist, oh-so-smug liberal viewpoint, and say that if George Bush was the deeply flawed means of removing one of the vilest rulers in the middle east (and Mr. H has always been careful to stop short of loving the messenger), then Michael Moore is the deeply flawed means of removing George W Bush.   Plus he's from Michigan, and can therefore do no wrong. Bit trite that, but I'd rather send some liberals into a movie theater to work up some anger than spend hours parsing the 9-11 Commission's findings, which seem more opaque than Hitch, or the New York Times, for that matter, say.

      He's back, and bringing the world a unique take on the lives of  urlLink Leopard Seals , etc ad nauseam.  This time it's from Australia, where Mr. "Lukey" D. will try and outdo Badgerwatch in the wildlife boredom stakes.   The Land Down Under, however, is an odd place for such a, er, webcast, for three reasons:  1) He said to me on numerous occasions that the denizens of Oz were drunken, humourless bores. True Fact. 2) Has threatened on several occasions to put the proffered  urlLink Vegemite  sandwich "where the sun don't shine". 3) Has confessed that his long-repeated claim to have relatives there cannot be true since he was birthed by Peruvian Manatees.  Still, you decide...

      Posting from a lovely house above Monterrey Bay, but it's a bit Fogg-y (there, that's the terrible pun out the way). I have not read anything recently, save the "funnies" on the left hand column of the Wall Street Journal, and that recent hissyfit that Ralph Nader threw on the phone at Salon. Having also recently finished Bruce Shapiro's excellent investigative journalism  urlLink http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1560254335/qid=1090622372/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/102-5971026-8125707?v=glance&s=books&amp;n=507846">compendium  I am not that shocked by how boring and humourless the sh**kickers of yore have become - Brit Hume, now of Fox News, was also once quite the digger.   Still, much more interested in talking about how great San Francisco is, and how the Napa Valley needs more kids. But Gringcorp has a sleeping figure to attend to, and will bid all adieu...

      Posting from a spanking new G4 Powerbook. Nice. Had to brag about that.  So, John Edwards  urlLink praising  Tony Blair as a model statesman. Wrong on so many levels.   There are the superficial parallels with the cheese-meister Kerry has adopted as a running mate. Both are lawyers, and both have young families they trot out before cameras at the slightest opportunity. Both have this slightly religious, slightly sincere demeanor. But to say that Blair has apologised over the WMD thing is going a bit too far - Blair has simply been a little less smug than he was after Hutton.  As a way of embarrassing Blair into remembering that he really shouldn't be making nice with the Republicans it is sort of neat. As "Evil" John E's first stab at this foreign policy business it was fairly well-thought. Providing Bush doesn't manage to get Blair to turn on Edwards (unlikely) it might just work. But, ya know, it's just wrong.  For the record, BTW, Robin and I were little more than acquaintances. But they always say you should blog from experience, and that was my take.

      Butler, that is. This morning's pun centres on the Butler Report, which has just appeared, and is summarised in  urlLink the Guardian . Britain has a streamlined version of the many  Iraq evidence enquiries that the war threw up in the US. The difference is that under the UK "constitution" the idea of entrusting parliament with an enquiry is plainly risible - few members have the requisite capacity for independent thought. Sure, senators and representatives can be a mite pompous, but they can be fairly searching.  Under the UK system, the Prime Minister first appoints  a judge from Ulster to investigate how a BBC journalist's claims, that the government distorted evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass-destruction, contributed to the death of one of this journalist's sources. The eponymous  urlLink Hutton Report  was about as rough on the government as might be imagined from a former brief for the government in the Widgery Enquiry into  urlLink Bloody Sunday .  Then, Butler, a former civil servant and now head of an Oxford College, was appointed by Tony Blair to look at the intelligence dossier behind going to war. He has followed the Senate's lead and decided that it was all the fault of the spies. Fair play, no-one wants to bring down a government, and the spooks do tend to produce some fairly shoddy goods at times. And then we take it as gospel, egged on by lurid reports to the House of Commons.  But here's the line that gets me:   Lord Butler acknowledged that calls for the resignation of the incoming MI6 chief, John Scarlett, JIC chairman at the time of the dossier's publication, would follow publication but said he hoped he would stay on. "We have a high regard for his abilities and his record," the report said.   So, he won't dump on the prime minister, realises the dossier's claims are ludicrous, has to dump on the spies, and then says of the top one, and I paraphrase, "he's a thoroughly good egg, and shouldn't have to fall on his sword." I mean, Gringcorp has had personal dealings with Lord Butler, and finds him to be pleasant and sharp enough, although his palliness with his subjects is a tad obvious (watch his "Me and Bill Clinton 4 Eva" routine). But he's patrician to the core, and far more at home with the civil servant chums that concocted this farrago, under political pressure or no,  than the unwashed that doubted  its veracity the moment it was uttered. Somehow Gringcorp is angry but not surprised.

      So, going into the the all-star game, the the Times goes with this soooooper-saucy  urlLink headline  about Mike Piazza's relationship with balls. Looks like it forgot about the sensitivity of the issue post- urlLink Belle & Sebastian kerfuffle . The sponge/stone conundrum (as Withnail & I's  urlLink Uncle Monty  would pose it) would seem to be settled.  And sorry to go all  urlLink Portal of Evil  on you for a moment, but Roger Clemens' wife's  urlLink website  is soooooper-demented.

      Ray Kelly has done a sterling job of persuading the  urlLink Daily News  that all manner of black-clad hell is going to descend on the city for the GOP convention. Apparently he realises that the transparently demented Ed Koch ads may not be enought to keep New Yorkers from having a sneaking sympathy for the anti-GOP crowd. The way to get round this is to paint the protestors as animal-hating scum.   Now preventing some privately-educated, hoodie-wearing nihilists from taking shots at police, and their animals, is a good thing. The fact that these anarchists usually commute in from Westchester, seat of their teenage angst, while the professional global protestors are more likely to spend their time finding interesting ways to disrupt traffic, is lost on the News. Tips lifted from "the internet" are likely to be garbage.   The News is leagues ahead of the Post in providing thoughtful local coverage. The Post tends to resemble Fox News, with Page Six and a police blotter bolted on. So, a pity to see Mort's men following the NYPD's talking points so unblinkingly as well.

      The benefit? Ah yes, the  urlLink Koncert For Kerry  benefit, loosely organised around a Brooklyn-despising routine from David Cross. First off, not enough  urlLink Ted  - three songs where he beats the s*** out of his geetar was fun, but left us aching for more. Hehehehehe. But the greasy Sadaam Hussein lookalike with the limey accent (we think it's genuine) rocked all over the sweaty floor, and the  urlLink Capitol Years  put up one of the most valiant struggles we've ever seen against  urlLink Southpaw's  dubious acoustics.  Not being a tinkle, or Mr. Show fan, we will forbear comment on whether the comedy was any good, although the angry atheist entertained us while we tried to semaphore desperately our need for a drink to the 'Paw's indeifferent wait staff. But we think they got the balance right, although a desperate need to vote out Bush seemed to  be the hallmark. Still it avoided smelling of  urlLink Red Wedge , which, given the Leo/Weller comparisons, was achievement enough.

      A quote from the first Frank Black solo album there. And a characteristically tortured way of saying I saw the John and Teresa show on Larry King last night. Well I was making a salad, but I  heard  it. See, John can sometimes tilt his head and look sensitive, and smile a mean dopey smile, but errs more towards adorable than charming. And adorable is a tad redundant now we have the Edwards-childs.  But back to the way he talks. It really is like a stepfather trying to be affable, possibly to a stepdaughter's smack-addicted no-good fiance. Yes, that strained. I think Chris Suellentrop's Slate  urlLink piece  has it about right. Especially the monstrously laboured humor. How the grim demeanor goes down with the 99% of the population less flippant than me is anyone's guess.  Quick piece of alien-on-alien carping here, but will Teresa's otherwordly (i.e. definitely not Kansas) accent put anyone off the ticket? Again, hard for me to tell. I can't get Mistress  urlLink Octopussy , queen of the circus, out of my head. Trying now to think whether anyone apart from Mrs. Adams got to be a Bond Gurl twice...

      Or cigarettes, in English English slang. Phillip Morris is considering using Fair Trade tobacco, or tobacco bought ethically from sustainable sources, in its fags, or tabs, or growlers, or bines (top  urlLink Huddersfield  slang, that). They already do it with coffee, which makes you a bit loco, and would now do it with the death sticks.   This has struck people as a little disingenuous, as this lovely  urlLink piece  in  the Guardian notes. Some might call it Greenwash. Although it was a tabaholic until last October, Gringcorp bears the merchants of lung cancer no ill will, and likes to see it as a gentle bit of reverse culture jamming or whatever. Thing is, the Marlboro man is probably completely serious.

      I like Michael Moore. A lot. And I think that the Moore-haters are humorless drones. But I love this  urlLink nickname   Big shout to the  urlLink Stewie Griffen fanlisting  - currently (re)considering me for inclusion.  The Black Keys? They were pretty good, but even though the World Financial Centre Plaza was a lovely place to watch the sunset, I'm not sure it worked for fuzzy juke-joint blues. Still, that's what you get for not paying to go to concerts. I might make an exception for the  urlLink John Kerry benefit  on Friday, campaign finance restrictions upon foreigners permitting, but only because  urlLink Ted  will be there.

      So, after the holiday break, there are many things in Gringcorp's in-tray. An awesome rooftop party for its birthday (I would thank the party responsible, but they must remain even more anonymous than the Gumby. I.e. a little). Watching the fireworks from a Cobble Hill rooftop. The Nathan's pilgrimage. Finally watching Farenheit 9/11 (big cheers from BAM. Surprisingly lucid). The cheesiest man in the world as prospective VP (he does at least do much better than Dubya all the things Dubya is meant to be good at).  No, I want to take a look at  Mr. Tim Brown's excellent  urlLink Last Word , whose July issue is up now. Tim has a  urlLink blog  as well, but the blog mostly seems to be about bubble gum and farts. I discovered the Last Word on  urlLink Portal of Evil , a deed that Tim would no doubt blame on the right-wing establishment in Kentucky.   Tim has been cross about bullying, school uniforms and republicans since 1993, and would be at least State Senator right now if he was not so enamored of  Explosions. And Damage. It's nice to know that Progressives (he seems to prefer it to liberals) can still make soome noise in Red states, and be extremely rude and ornery at the same time. I salute you.  Tonight, we rock Battery Park City with the sound of the  urlLink Black Keys .

      Thanks to Batgirl for emailing me  urlLink this  from Counterpunch, which I always forget to read. This a very local story about the Atlantic Yards Development, dressed up as an attack on the  urlLink New York Times .  Now, Times-bashing is incredibly boring, and usually only reinforces the paper's self-regard. I think it would keep up its preposterous campaign to be taken seriously as this Olympian, impartial paper of record regardless.  But this series of positive stories about the development, including a  really weird one about the truly terrible Atlantic Center Mall, is worth eamining. [Side note about that mall: it has an Old Navy, Pathmark and a Circuit City, as well as some other really cheap joints laid out in the most cramped and confusing way possible. You feel as if you're walking around a hospital. The counter-proposals usually include knocking it down - very funny].  Nice to see some heat about the development that doesn't come from the sports writers. Mike Lupica in the Daily News did  urlLink dwell  on it a few months back, and managed to cut through some of Ratner's Nets-coming-back-to-Brooklyn-and-replacing-theDodgers crap.  I also thought that the coalition between Nets fans and the Park Slope crew was doomed to fail (too many  urlLink sniggering hipsters ). But hopefully the  urlLink Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn   Crew can put some more heat on starry-eyed reporters. After all, bringing the mighty Tish James over was always going to be the easy bit.   The headline, by the way, refers to the last Ratner to overexrtend him self. He was Gerald Ratner, owner of a chain of British Jewelry stores, who once decided to refer to his own product as crap. In fact, he noted that a prawn sandwich would cost more and last longer than some of his earrings. He was fired. Even though he owned most of the company. The chain is now known as Signet.

      Yes, the practice of ridiculing the New York Times for hopelessly missing out on cultural advances may be easy, but it's still satifying. Today, the reporter from the Metro section walks by a breakdancer in Union Square and decides to  urlLink start a revolution . "Breakdancing is back," they breathlessly report, "at last we will have a busking medium that will take on those pesky mimes, silver-painted statues, and Peruvian pan-pipers in the battle for our change." I was hoping that one of the people they interviewed would make up some stuff, but it seems to be pretty straight.  Still, a quick stroll through the iTunes store shows that such luminaries as the Freestylers, Cannibal Ox, and of course the Beastie Boys have been blithering about breaking over the last ten years. The guys behind Big Beat at  urlLink Skint  were pretty fond of it as well.  Palid stuff, mind, next to  urlLink Spin 's recent article on LA's "Clown-dancing and krumping scene". Bonkers, but the NYT has already picked up on Madonna picking up krumping. Krumping is the new breakdancing, apparently, so the Times article should have been going on about how breakdancing never went away. Like the Beastie Boys, or  urlLink Marmite . Or it could posit that it hibernated in Brighton for a while (per the Skint view of breakdancing history).  All withering comments from true scenesters much appreciated...

      I was grabbed by another of those "we commissioned an independent report on ourselves and it says we're great releases today.  urlLink This one's  from the  urlLink International Finance Corporation , the arm of the World Bank dedicated to the use of private finance in development. Just that little mission statement gives you an idea of the amount of hating that the NGOs get in against it. It also provides a useful home for talented graduates, or retired businessmen/pols, from less-developed countries.  So, the IFC realises that its standard argument - that private capital, and big infrastructure projects, improve lives - has not convinced many people. So, instead of just saying "everyone that hates development go and live in the scrub for eternity without the internet" (which is tempting, if rather symplistic), it decides to commission a report about how well it is doing in financing oil and gas a mining projects. The report is written by a former Indonesian Mining minister. Riiiiiiiiight....  Look, time to realise that these reports rarely improve an organisation's culture, and have little PR value. The only reports that I've seen that are hugely savage about the subject/client have been ones about grave crimes that happened decades ago. rather like Bertlelsmann's  urlLink holocaust report . Fifty years seems to be the earliest these things become useful.  Also, check the newest  urlLink Seal Blog  out. Gringcorp has set it up to counter lies about seals in the media.

      Right, time for an unpleasant and unwarranted attack on  urlLink AM NY , the free daily published by Tribune/Newsday, which has decided that it will make its reputation by bringing down the Statue of Liberty Foundation leadership. It is very important that the freebies start to offer more than wire service reheats - hello Metro, whose first issue's publisher's letter seemed to patronisingly suggest that young people liked Eminem and didn't want their news to be too challenging, as  urlLink Gothamist  noted. Nevertheless, AM's  urlLink front page  (a click will download a pdf, hopefully), thrust in my face when I got off the subway, suggests that it needs some perspective. There was an awful lot going on NY yesterday, what with the Terror Alerts (Genuine or not? I don't have the time or expertise to judge, but still love Howard Dean for being all  urlLink grouchy and sceptical  about it. Persuading a couple of congressmen too dump on a trustee's head doesn't make it. Even if you do note that the Daily News encouraged people to donate to the Foundation.  Couple of boasts -   1) got listed, albeit automatically, on  urlLink Queerfilter  (although the site seems to be down right now. 2) won a bottle of Merlot by predicting that Kerry could not get a 10-point bounce out of the Edwards selection 3) Scored some cool elephant seal pictures to take on the  urlLink Leopard Seal  scum, although Mr. D seems determined to llet his site become a haven for viagra peddlers. Anyway, with luck, the photo in question will be posted above

      No internet cafes anywhere in Southern California. But much cultural feeding. First, Gringcorp rocked out to the accessible techno stylings of  urlLink Miss Kittin , who has recently tried to smile more and be less of a frosty German beat domiatrix. This was at the Key Club, the Sunset Strip club that is the new Viper Room (as far as Gringcorp's rather oiled cred radar was concerned), ready to lead the charge against resurgent Silver Lake (yes Gringcorp is bicoastal in making up stuff about neighborhoods).  But, more significant was the pilgrimage we made to the San Dimas water park Raging Waters, the inspiration for "Waterloo!" from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Put simply, Raging Waters is the coolest thing in all of California, apart from Amoeba Music, even though (as the  urlLink Fast Rewind  trivia fiends note) some park in Arizona called Sunsplash was used. Napoleon and Gringcorp are on the same page here.
