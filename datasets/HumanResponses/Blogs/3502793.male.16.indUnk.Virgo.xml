      30.06.04 (Wen)[Exams, Day 3][Rei, Day10]     Arh...Evening... Its been 3 days of mugging, I seriously despise this method of study... Barely recovering from the fever, I m unable to attain the feverish state of study. I guess this exam is highly unprepared for despite its importance.    As I m typing this entry, I m witnessing a match of chess between my apprentice and my friend, Kenrick. Hmmz... This is something worth watching. Though the apprentice is highly disadvantaged in this match, I guess we will never really know how it turns out till it ends. Like they said "It ain't over till the fat lady sings", nothing against the "well-covered"~    Today's Exam was very badly done. A mistake in estimations as I decided to forsake Arithmetic And Geometric Progression, thinking it would only weigh 3 or 4 marks, not knowing it took 30marks instead~    Well... my mind wasnt in the state of study to start with. The mind idles far and wide like a traveller. From adeast as absurb as weilding Katanas to something as progressive as building a rockwall in my room. Well... my mind was also alot on the game, Mu.    This game has been revived. Well, I did stop playing it for a moment in time. I guess the lustre of this game has be reformed within me.

      24.06.04 (Thu)[4 Days Till Exams][Rei, Day 4]     Hmmz wonder... what is happening to me... My rest seem to be rather restless this few days... Could it be... the relationship is taking a toll on me? Well... predicted it wouldnt be so easy, being alone for so long, one cannot have someone beside him so fast, it will give him an environmental shock. Though matter how un-humanly he tries to be.    Today, being totally alone... I guess would be best. I catched up on my Chemistry studies. But I need more practice. At least I have compiled the notes for one chapter.    Hmmz... It seems that I have made Kenrick become a worthy chess sparing partner. His skills are amazing as he manage to win me in 4 games. That is highly unique considering he never played the game before. His amazing ability to adapt to this game might be a the reason for his solubility amongst the crowd. And tonight, I lost my 2nd game in a row!    The relationship, Rei is hanging on a tight rope. Being that it is purely sustained through physical contact, it can break the moment physical contact is not established. This relationship has a couple of "strained points". Being that this relationship was purely sustained on physical contact, it is only a matter of time the girl will undermine her value.    Hmmz... Despite living so high up, cockroach has occassionally find its way up to my house. Its a puzzle why and how would a cockroach take the trouble to come all the way up. But nevertheless, they end up in a bottle which sends them down to hell. This amazing creatures have long arouse disgust amongst the female species of the Humans. It is a wonder how something so amazingly small could scare something a 100 times it's size. But nevertheless this creature has been imbued with many state-of-the-art equipment. With an exo-skeleton that is strong on the outside and the capability of moving with great agility, this is indeed worthy for its title. If this was to be matched with a tanker, the tanker must have the capability of traveling as fast as a ferrari and able to climb walls! In addition, Fly!    Their digestive system is also extremely... expandable, being they can eat almost anything organic which means they can feast on something as normal as human food till complex protein such as hair and finger nails. Hair as most would already realise takes years to decompose on its own. But if humans master the cockroaches' ability to digest such matter, humans could probably reduce their gabbage weight by millions of tones in an extremely short time. I suspect the cockroaches can also melt through thin layers of mixture of aluminium and paper, such as those wrapper of a mentos sweet.    The sensory is also highly advance. Though I cant say much about its compound eyes, being that other beings have better eyesight, they compensate for it by having a pressure detector. The two tails, infamously related to a cockroach has its "pressure detector" which also has its own "on-board computer" or brain! This brain though not as developed as the one in the head, can control the bodily functions hence explains its capability to live without its head for weeks. This sure makes the Headless Horseman feel normal.    So girls, before you engage the cockroach with your insecticide enough to kill an army, take sometime to admire it.... then... KILL IT... its a pest!  Sincerely, Aven Rei (The Bug Catcher)

      23.06.04 (Wen)[5 Days before Exam][Rei, Day3]      This seems to be another dejavu... As my body lapsed between the border of Lala-dreamland and another day on Earth. The next thing I knew, it was already 11.21am! Gosh... I m so late... But what m I late for? I have no appointment today. Great... I meant it both sarcastically and truely... wonder which is more.    No Rei... Well Rei is also the term for a meeting together with the newly created improper relationship. Well to think, I m still high on the kiss. Wonder if it is the cause for my earlier sluggishness...    It is strange, how could someone who have been alone for so long suddenly became so dependent on someone... This is truely disgusting yet it feels so right. Everything about the relationship feels that way now. I guess that was the original reason I avoided human contact, I wanted clarity in deciding my direction. And now that I have her, I m truely lost.    Whilst eating my Breakfast/Lunch, I start to ponder over my standing upon this new-borned relationship.  Sincerely, Aven Rei (The Eternally Contemplating)

      22.06.04 (Tue)[6 Days Before Mid-years][Rei 2nd, Day2]    The day start of as any other day would, lazy and with much reluctance to get out of the comfortable bed. After washing up and all, I was joined by my cousin... Well he played a computer game, that isnt the largest surprise on Earth... being that he is a game fanatic...    And that caused me to be late for my "group study" with the G3G~ Well... the group study went well... for 40minutes... then I had to fetch Sasha Rei.    This meeting... might probably be spurred on by the previous. It comes as a pleasant affirmation as I was worried she felt uncomfortable about the physical contact yesterday. By wanting to come, knowing the curriculum.    We spent our time in lover's central, Esplanade... Gosh... the mood... it was so... passionate... The feel of the other person around you... The whisperings... and the faces so close... with body ever so in contact... It was almost a crime. That, we came to it as a conculsion. It was wrong but... it was so right.    The kiss... it was so addictive... Couldnt keep my mind off it later... Never have I felt such sensations... Never would I think I would get addicted to it. The initial feel of it was rather disgusting as the saliva of my partner dries up near the mouth, resulting in a sticky feel. And I kinda wipe it away each time. But the stigma that one taste the bad odour of the other... is over-stated as I didnt feel disgusted by it nor was the taste significant enough to be felt. But the greatest sensation to the kiss isnt the taste of the partners mouth... cause if it is taste you want, rather go for a buffet. Instead, it is the playing of the tongue that makes a kiss truely enjoyable. It is so wrong... Yet... It felt so right. Wonder what song were this lyrics from but it truely describe the feel of this relationship. But this wouldnt be the first time I had an improper relationship... just that this time, the physical contact was fully established and the stakes are higher...    The sense of escapism and passion, it makes my head spin with excitement as every dark corner became a battlefield where passion flares like that of myriad of gun fires. The feeling of someone other than yourself and the pressence, it truely fills me up.    I seem to have lost touch of reality as I forgotten I had lessons later back at city hall. And while sending her back, I also realised that the Linkin Park Concert was today... Hmmz... after my lessons, I went to see how much I could watch... and hehe... can see quite clearly! I m such a miser~ But actually, not really, being that I had no time to go for it either and didnt really want to borrow anymore money from my parents. Guess I shouldnt be spending money of other people...so I wont spend till I have my own income.    But while waiting for a friend, I got spotted... Damn... The code has been voilated. I shouldnt be seen...  Sincerely, Aven Rei (The Eternally Inappropriate Person)

      21.06.04(Mon)[7 days till Mid-years]    Well... I started the countdown. Yet this week... my "group studies" are mere... political visits. And today... there would be 3 meetings.    Yawnz... Was abruptly awakened by a phone call... gosh... But at least I was already partially awake when the call came... or I would have slept past it. It is one of those mood where you wake up... but feels like you are still dreaming... cant move your body and your mind lapse back into a sleep... yet your mind still remains partially concious of the enviroment around you, every sound made... namely... a phone call!    Well... the day went as planned. A "group study" with a classmate... at the same time, a trade of information. Offering slivers of information to confirm the others that I already have.    After that, a visit to my "girlfriend". Due to the nature of the relationship, being that it isnt a normal relationship(like my previous were...), the term given to this relationship for the present moment is Rei. Her code name for now will be Sasha Rei. But she will lose this term when something greater takes her place. To a certain extent, I rather pity this relationship. Techniqically, it would seem like a normal relationship... if not for my mis-guided code. My affinity towards SA is the reason for such a mutation in this relationship. Yet... She might be the more important one, being that she is so real... while SA still remains rather illusive. I guess... at least, this would be a complete fling. At least physical contact was properly established unlike the previous accounts. But this time... I might have initiated too fast... I m afraid I might have blown it... But it has been assured that it was welcomed...    This might be one of the greater things to happen yet... Being that my weakness of wanting human company will now be fufilled through her. Yet... I hoped I could offer her much more... She deserves more than a guy who thinks of another while with her. But I didnt think of SA while I was with her... I guess that was the least I could do to compensate the incompleteness in this relationship.    But typing this in this journal... is rather awkward... Being that she is one of the few readers of this journal... But I dont think she will feel offended... right? At least this way, I can convey ideas which I m too shy to put forward directly. But putting it up for the world to see... isnt the best suggestion.    Argh... And now, that my emotional needs are satisfied, I need to get down to the actual business at hand, my studies. 7 days... it closer than ever.  Sincerely, Aven Rei (The Inproper Lover???)

      18.06.04 (Fri)     Gosh... I m addicted to the song Roses by Outkast. The beat is suitable for breakdancing's foot work. But the song's true meaning isn't like the title.    Well to more... important things... well there aint much things that are important in this period of time.. Besides the encroaching mid-years. This is indeed most worrying. Yet... I m still too laxed... The core reason why I hate meddeling with stuff girls are involved in. Being that if they cry, I weaken... If I fall for any, I become blinded and hence weakened... Or... accidentally bring one too close hence suffer the side-effects...    Well... in lights of news that SA might no longer be a valid target, back-up plans are starting to come in place. This might seem disgusting to those who believed I was in love and all. And most will ask me to believe in the possibility. But this is indeed most absurb. For one, is this back-ups are already real late. Usually, I would have a plan before even engaging the person. And another is that I m eventually a living being. I do not wish to wait forever. It is a cruel fate for one to be eternally alone. That is if I have eternaty to start with.    A back-up plan is in place. Though this is rather disapointing. Being that this back-up plan... is too well-prepared. The reason why my back-ups always fail in the past was due to the fact I do not tell them anything till I fail and HAD to depend on them.    The reason for such procastination previously is due to the fact that it is a rather crude move to make someone feel like a replacement. This feelings can serve as the starter for any acts of hostility in the near-future.    Nevertheless, my delay in SA... is to blame. If only I moved fast enough in all my previous attempts, I wouldnt have failed... Cant expect anyone to wait for me eternally.    On another more appropriate issue, my Project Work(pw). That Swine, Petrina just hijack the project as predicted. Petrina has been a bane since serangoon jc! Gosh... its a cruel enough a fate to be with her during the first 3 months in serangoon. This short little(little???    Well now, readers, dont go thinking that my spite for her is due to her race or appearance but she was indeed a bane to my life in jc(s). That can be well proven by the fact that 2 of my closest friends in Serangoon and Queensways are indians. Well... this kinda popped out when an indian guy asked if I hated her due to her race, my reply was, well I m very good friends with you, arent I?    But about the part where I do not hate her for her appearance... well that part might be a lie. She looks hideous. But I dont spite her due to that. Rather, a person's looks tell you roughly how the person behaves and the person's status. Coupled with the person's voice and a few examples of her behaviour, you more or less got watever you need.    One characteristic that I truely hate, is the fact she tries to control power she cant understand. Well for one is that I destroy people like this.    Another is the fact that she just 2 face me. Due to her failure to contact the team, she claim to have done the project by herself and her friend. But this is highly suspicious. Being that her friend was overseas. And in addition, I m overseas. She might be the physics teacher,part 2. Well, I will have my vengence... sooner than you think...  Sincerely, Aven Rei (The Power Oblisk Destroyer)

      17.06.04 (Thur)     arh... another meaningless day. How suiting... that I pondered over what m I looking forward to in life... again...    Well... the reason why this thought repeats itself... is due to the fact that my objectives are always changing. Perhaps this is my way of meditating and restating my directions. Personally, clarity of direction might be one of the factor for the need of strenght.    Due to the uncertainty in the pursuit of SA, the search for a back-up plan has started. This might probably sound most selfish and highly chauvanistic. But it is something any logical being will do. I have waited long enough...    The biggest problem with my taste of girls is the fact that I do not really target the looks first. Most of the time, an evaluation of the possibility of one relationship. Due to this characteristic of decision, more often than not, the first target is actually the person who felt mutually about me.    Yet... despite this almost ideal choice maker, my failures are still endless... as you can see from the result, I never suceeded. Something that always go wrong is that their feelings changed. Sadly, the change isnt mutual too. Being that once I chose a target, rarely do I change.    Coupled with the draining effect of caring for another, each time I create a target list, I risk weakening myself. But do not take this as a cry for sympathy. Being that my weakening can be seen as simmering down and an act of maturing.    This is also perhaps a form of evolution itself. Being weak means I need to spend lesser attention to step down my strenght for another.    Well... now... let me watch this extremely ingenious show, "Who's Line Is It Anyway"... Its just so funny.

      16.06.04 (Wen)     Woke up with a very bad start... Its one of those days where you wake up, knowing how bad it will be and wanting so badly to end. To start with, the first thing that one must have in order to have a good day is a good sleep on the night before. That I so happenly do not have. My sleep was haunted with the fear of the paranormal. Then again, fear is too much an insult to me.    Instead, I was kinda protecting my family from it, in my dreams. The healer's code and Demon X, fear is not something I m suppose to possess. Reason for healers is if the healer fears the threat, how could one heal properly and give hope to the injured? Reason for Demons, well, we are meant to be feared, not to fear, our weakness might be our undoing. Hence the dream was about a night I cant sleep, wonder what is worst, being unable to sleep or dreaming that you are unable to sleep.    The start was already bad enough. But my mood made it worst. Didnt feel like studying. Gosh. I de-evolved and played "pokemon silver"!    The afternoon was rather boring. Being that I m home alone. Then again, it wouldnt be any better with my family. And when you think I can find solice in thinking of SA. Think again.    A source caught her dirty dancing. I guess my theory about her, is correct.    This is one of those days, where I feel all my lifes are crashing and caving it. Where escaptism becomes impossible as the fantasies are also wrecked.    I guess my biggest mistake is not "not loving". Rather putting my love to all the wrong investments. Guess its time to get a better stockbroker, before I become truely broke of love, Icy Cold. (trust me, it aint no 7-up ice)    Its time like this, that makes me want to succumb to one of those stars. But, they are not safe for me.    A system was thought of a long time to try to catagories people who can stand and co-exist with me. This was a bid to try to understand why the others cant. Being that not alot of people can stand me.    5 colors was used to represent the 5 types of signature I detected in people who can exist around me. This colors were arranged like that of a Magic The Gathering circle. For your info, SA is a black signature.    The 5 colors are black, red, green, white and blue. This is in order with black after blue, hence forming a circle. Each color will possess a certain characteristic and prediction.    There can always be more than 1 person who possess the color. But if they possess status, they will displace each other, the one with the stronger signature will take the color.    I guess I will tell ya more about this in the later entry. For now, let me try studying...TRY....  Sincerely, Aven Rei (The Hopeless Nerd)

      15.06.04 (Tues)     Evening... another day has passed... but unlike an immortal... my are numbered... both humanly... and as a student... its rather ironic... that humans always resist whats good for them... as in the case of a student... refusing to study... but I m not any different... playing games before my mid-years which I m ever so unprepared for... Then again, it isnt the first time I pulled off such a folly. My life is made out of mistakes and accidents. I swear I could make a career out of it.    Well last year during my O'levels, we had night study on wenesdays. But there is always like 5 hours to kill before the night study starts. Hence I find myself in a Lan shop, fighting the 2nd world war.    Despite the impending doom I m goin to face, my mind still cycles about logic which have been already long thought of. I guess it is this that keeps the logic ever so relevant and ever so flawless.    Alot of people see this "logic" as nothing but mere rules created to hide myself from reality. Perhaps they are right. As I said before, the depth of the logic is like the depth in which I m far from salvation.Yet no one is really living "reality". As there are too many versions. Even in studying, which we were told "you will never go wrong in doing so", it is only a form of reality for those who are in pursuit for knownledge or future material gains.    For me, logic is mere reasoning that has been made to appear relevant by putting examples of reality in it for people to relate to.    I mean who would believe me if I said I could read their minds or see into the future. Techniqically, I can. Yet everybody has it.    In how such a bold system works, it is merely a guess of the most probabality of events. All you got to do is to work out the situation and look at its direction. It becomes as simple as a ball rolling to the edge of the table and dropping.    The taking a step back to observe the situation only gives one greater experience in what will happen. Somethings that I have gotten so used to. When I reveal such an absurb idea of reading a person's mind, the first question that pops out is "Then what I m thinking". The beauty of it, is the words are more or less similar. But if I m to answer that question, the answer is Nothing. As it is, a human mind is mostly slow. The occasional witty people will more often then not, think of a number or color. But by the time they conjure such a thought, and materialize it, it would be slightly too long since the question was asked.    Another human reaction that was observed is the way one despises being predicted. Humans are such vain creatures. Always wanting to be unique and unpredictable. In that, they have sign themselves up for being too predicatable. When a prediction is made, one will realised that the subject will try to avoid that possibility as much as possible, a sign of defiance. But it is only when one becomes totally lost or had no other paths to take, that one heeds the prediction. And to recover one's pride, they either show signs of amazement to direct the attention away from their stupidity or just say it was pure luck.    Whatever I written might be seen as the only choice one have. But the prediction system isnt that primitive. We can go one step further by putting in possibilities. If one knows the subject's preference, one can lower the possibilities down. And if one is adventurous, one can see chain reactions.    This prediction system is a integration of Logic and Human Logic. This might seem rather silly. Human logic, isnt it also logic? Well to a certain extent, yes. But in its answers to certain question, they might vary.    This isnt like one of those idiot's guide to cystal-gazing as I m unable to provide you activities which you can test this new found knownledge. But a advice I will sincerely offer to better your foresight, look into everything as a baby would but think about everything you seen as a sage would, and also be able to relearn "realities". Not everything you think you know is always right.  Sincerely Aven Rei (Far Seer)

      14.06.04(Mon)    Hmmz... another day passes... another day closer to my mid-years... As it stands, I m rather unprepared... this is indeed worrying... my maths... Trigo... its foundation... is so weak... Cjc's maths... is just faster than Srjc... then again...  something that do not kill me... only makes me stronger... I m created to last... Immortal...    Hmmz... today... also seems to be a revisting of a past... I wish to forget... yet relive... today, I went back to Queensway Secondary... to collect my O'lvl certificate... its interesting... to see how much my (ex)class has changed... Each in their own path...    Kenrick... one of my closer friends during my stay there... seem to have grown... in character... the reason why I saw him as a charge...was due to his resemblance... in position...And slowly.. he is catching on the theories I structured a long time ago... such as looking into reflective images to look around...    His exposure to the enviroment... will soon give me a glimpse of how I will probably become...    Usually... I rather hide from my past... it being a way to remember past mistakes... but another reason... is give me this guilt... of wanting to live that same live again... this is an extremely bad feeling... being the objective-orientated person... this feelings hinder my character...    Well... revisiting the past... also brought about the not so bright past... as it is... Jinyi... the guy who has S.A's number and email... have showed greater interest in the girl I accidentally picked up... well thank heavens she is attached...    But this revealation... only brought about a idea... for a trade... damn... I stopped the trading method once... cause it was the cause for most of my "improper relationships"....    As it is... not alot of people know... how draining it is for me to stay infactuated about someone... well... thats due to my character... it being the all-knowing and almighty....    When one is infactuated... it hinders one's vision of the world and current events... as time stops for the person and course of movement too... with feelings for someone... my strenght in this "game" is stepped down by alot... for example... I cant guess what is more likely to happened in the near-future... being that I will probably lie to myself that I still have a chance... So... "loving" actually kinda blinds me...    My mind will also seize to function properly... as thoughts go in circles of "she loves me, she loves me not"...    This draining of my energy... has left me pretty weak... the same reason why I acted so weakly in this game... as my previous form... will just walk up to the girl... and ask... but due to my sequels of failures... I m drained...    This really makes the idea of quiting the "game" as a whole... sounds... so realistic... gosh... where are all the cupids when you need them...

      13.06.04[Sun]    Evening... hmmz... the return of a brother from his responsibility might be a politically good news... but the return also comes with other... not so bright side-effects... the usage of computer comes to become a limited comodity... its hard to stay off the computer when you have only 2 days a week... but nevertheless... the hours become highly excessive... hence... my journals are usually typed or writtened before hand and posted when I get the chance to...    Due to recent events... it has come to mind that my existence here... was never... to start with... well.. techniqically... due to my method of living, I pretty much live in a 3rd dimension... a 3rd Dimension being... this beings are not really living...    I guess my analytical personality had a beginning... and a matter a fact, I remember it rather clearly... perhaps the shock which came from such a realisation might have cause a 3rd dimension living lifestyle...    To many... most should be rather lost... right about now... so lets simplify... well... a person who analyse things... usually do not analyse from the inside... rather they see things as a whole then into detials or vise versa... but due to the need to zoom in and out of their life... they tend to be living in a world of their own most of the time... their strongest advantage... is also coincidentally their largest weakness... their analytical view point give them an intellectual headstart... so in any quarrels... they are merely pulling out things that were already thought of rather than thinking it out on the spot... this advantage in arguments... also make them very hard to convince... hence it becomes hard to "save" them...    Personally... I believe it is a very scary event to hear them talk in the 3rd dimension dialog... in another words... talk as a another person who isnt involved... this can at time... make them slightly un-human...    This capability(or problem) usually give them an additional characteristic of being a loner or someone who's trust was betrayed and hurt badly once... A few occassionally will try to help... however... most of them will fail... being that they are usually less intellectually advantaged...    But dont be mistakened... I m not hurt very badly... and hence... I still need humans in the end~ haha~    Hmmz... now... back to me... well... aint it all just about me... thats why its my journal!... anyway... the trip has seem to brought about a... very unusual habit... this is... the problem of sleeping... not because of me thinking of how much has past... rather... I m sleepless... cause for 8 days... I have to be on guard at night... being that I must remain vigilant when I m not sleeping in my room... so... now that I have the comforts of my bed... I should have theoratically slept soundly... but... the prolonged "installation" of this vigilance... have cause me much sleep...    Another thing that happened... well... there aint much happening during the holidays... is the discovery... of a 2 things... well to start with... SA... well she was actually a schoolmate of my secondary school friend... and worst of all... he has her number... or so he claims~ that jerk is now playing the "I have power over you" card... gosh... how irraitating... And when you thought that Singapore cant get any smaller... well... a past of mine... I m not so proud of... during chingay... I accidentally picked up a girl(accidentally???)... and gave her a journal... actually that was the first proper journal that has dates recorded into it... this might... seem highly inappropriate to you people... giving a journal... so easily to a girl who I just met...    Well... thats mine shame... and why dig it up? well... she is now in JJC... Queenswayian Central for JCs... gosh... and now everybody seem to know about this incident... gosh...    I seriously need to get out of Singapore... Arrh....    hmmz... this reminds me... wonder whos reading... hee~  Sincerely Aven Rei (The Limelight Hungry  Vampire)

      12.06.04(Sat)    Evening... Back to telling you more about my lessons during the trip... hmmz my purpose in the journey was to refurbish a library in this small village called Quop(Qoup, Kuap, Kaup... so many way of spelling it)... its the native's way of saying snore... I guess they take the phrase "sleepy village" alittle further...   The exposure to such an enviroment which could only exist in the deepest furthest conjoured idea... it was weird to see something like this exist despite your mind knowing it... I guess thinking you know and knowing you know... is a whole league of difference...   While this primary school in Quop tries so hard to get wooden chairs and table that stands and Blackboards to replace those that have been there since colonial time, Queensway Secondary is trying to get more colors into the walls of its extremely luxurious canteen and 6 computers for each of its 30+ classrooms ... Though personally... there are many better canteens in other secondary schools in Singapore...   Where they are still trying to get chalkboards which arent collapsing... Singapore has already been using whiteboards for 8 years...   I say this... not to spite or descriminate against the less wealthier countries.... but as something... which a Singaporean... might never truely know...   Well now... I guess to people now... I have found wealth in a less developed village... but in truth... I m still pretty much... the same... Being that I still lead an existence of a brat and miss the same people... even in the trip...   To most, when one is faraway from a love one, one will more likely stray... but... I grew more infactuated to her... I do not believe this is healthy... being that now... my affinity... is merely propelled blindly... things done blindly will never come to any good... not even if it resulted well...   I guess this... was actually already in the prediction... well... to those who arent very sure of what is going on... I more or less knew how I will grow by looking at how I already m... I have grown so weak in this period of time... that in order to continue my lavish existence... I had to... revert to my original form...   My original form is still highly objective orientated... but has a higher emotional drive... hence... it was this emotional drive that evolved into complex rules which already accounted for future events...   When I was stronger... I would never allow myself to fall so blindly for someone... it being that I will hurt myself very badly if rejected... This might be a kind of commitment problem... but nevertheless... it is very human... to NOT want to get hurt...   Hence this weakness... didnt prevent me from thinking about her... when I realise that my thoughts are highly concentrated on her... I start to believe it is something real... but in reality... nothing has happened to support this point of view... hence I call this an infactuation rather than love... being that I do not really believe in that concept...   But dont be fooled by my current state... it is merely conserving energy... hibernating... I believe that she wont be able to hold me... for more than 2 years... any longer than that... I will start attacking her... unless my affection for her... is too strong... but... that... is unlikely...  Sincerely Aven Rei (The Limelight Hungry  Vampire)

      11.06.04(Fri) To the Readers unknownst to me:    Evening...arh... I have returned... all not too soon, I hope... for the span of 8 days... I havent been able to come in contact with a Computer... well... its not that bad... once in a while... taking a step away from the civilisation you got all too familiar with to see something different...   This trip... has somehow enlightened me... for a moment... But dont you go thinking I have return an enlightened monk... here to teach the world a new way of existence...   Then again... who m I to teach others? When my method of existence... can be seen as absurb to so many... and it havent the tolerance for people coming so close... The Human-wannabe Vampire...   This trip... have gave me enough time away from my "reality" to reflect upon myself... and I came to a few conculsions... One of it... is that my depth in thinking... only shows my shallowness in reality... Illusion is only aided by presentation of such logic... words... the medium to which I create ideas and questions in the minds of the weak...   Well... I did push some of my theories to the group during the trip... and I m seen as being black and white... That I guess I should explain the reason to... Being black and white means you are clear of what is happening... if not try to act as if you are and show no signs of uncertainty... I guess this characteristic comes from DemonX program...   Let me try putting this is simpler terms... well if I were to convey to anybody an idea... the first things that go through a person's mind are questions which examine the integrity of the idea and how much truth in within it... so if I do not place a direct yes or no answer on the surface... it will appear as if the idea is flimsy... though many answers to complex questions do not bear the answer of yes or no... putting a percentage for the person... would be like saying... "maybe"... That isnt the most comforting answer if it was coming from your insurance agent... hee!   DemonX... is an extended version of human instincts... Demons... are creatures seen as abominations to humans... something mostly ugly, evil and ruthless... well... everything is quite right till the part about evil being ugly...   Demons are highly self-centered... caring mostly about themselves first before others... Their "care" do not just cover their daily needs... but also pleasures... hence when a human is able to be truthful to himself... he will realise his intentions are rather cruel... Hence when amplified, Demons become evil and ruthless   Then again... this set of rules which defines what is "good" and what is "bad" are made by the strong who were once weak... and it has ever since been the weapons of the weak...   In the demon world, each cannabalize on the other's weakness... hence the only sin in this dimension... is being weak...   But reflect deeper... who in this world wishes to be eternally weak and stepped on? It becomes second nature to a human or a demon to want power and affluence... when one realises the people who rarely get stabbed... are those high above...   Humans... are a weak being... highly complacent and unconcious of one's place in the world... then again... it is this... that makes it highly attractive to be a human... But a demon.. is one step higher... they being even higher... need one thing... most humans fail to gain... The ability to decide...   Free will... God's gift to humans... yet... Free will... is not really useful... when you consider how indecisive people are... Hence... when one shows sign of being confounded... one shows how easily he can be bent to do the bidding of others...   The ability to make decisions on the spot... isnt enough... I suppose making it fast... will be better if you make it right at the sametime... but... I, no matter how un-human... still have a human limit... I might probably be totally helpless in trying to surpass this line... Hence... not showing sign of regret and a straight up apology to clear all errs immediately... would be second best...   I think I shall put all my conclusions in segments rather than one whole entry... as this would cause a rather wordy journal...  Sincerely Aven Rei (The LimeLight Hungry  Vampire)

      01.06.04(Tue)[N2, Day 54] To the Readers unknownst to me:    Evening...hmmz this will be the last journal entry for the next 8 days... as I will be departing next morning for trip to Kuching, Sarawak... this is perhaps one of the most unprepared trips in my record of last minute preparation trips... luckily as of now... I have everything except a swiss army knife... so it aint that bad yet... the only thing I truely wish I had... was peace in my mind...   I m slightly feverished today... this is indeed worrying... as my parents wouldnt be able to look after me... and I might be quaranteed at the airport...   Well... I felt so bad in the afternoon... perhaps it because I havent been sick for such a long time... that I forgot how it felt... my systems were always slightly stronger as I have this belief that I m always invincible... but that is only cause my mental strenght is integrated into my physical self... so... so long as my will is strong... I should be able to heal and recover faster...   The cause for this rare anormaly... well... you could have guess... is my dilema... on the subject... Silly Adorable... I was always reluctant for fall for someone head over heals... cause this left me pretty weak... Shar says I m truely in love with S.A.... thats why I feel this way... but in truth, I felt this way for all my previous crushes... so... is this truely love or I m just to easily bought over... I m alittle frustrated now as when I thought that S.A was a losing game and was about to pull out of the game... lo and behold... Shar claims otherwise...   This is so troublesome... ironically... I should be happy that there is still hope in this game... but in actual fact... I m not... this only raises the time spent thinking about her... this is why... the only thing I truely wish I had on this trip... is a peace of mind...   Dont get me wrong and think I m putting all the blame on Li wen's lack in clarity about her status... I mean... she told her classmates she was attached... and told Shar otherwise... but in reality... I m to blame for it all... one is that I do not have the guts to talk to her... and 2nd... is that i cannot love... yet I fell head over heals for her...   This trip... might probably be my chance to breathe... but it might also cause my condition to worsen... as my mind is still scanning for her...   I placed the address for this journal on my friendster... I guess to a certain extent, I wish to be caught by her... then again... isnt that what a Limelight hungry vampire do, try to get caught? well one thing for sure... by getting caught, it makes my job a whole lot easier...   My "keep-within myself" or "act cool" attitude... is probably causing her to vex too... not that she feels for me... but I fear... she might fear me... I appear to be quite scary to alot of people... I guess my past-lifes had gave me so much... too much... the way I talk, the way I move... its original reason for being so... is no longer valid...   But in the case that she is really reading my hopeless and perhaps almost desperate cries for sanity... I guess the best thing to do... is for her to look for my friend, Christian... as I left certain instructions pertaining to the method of finding me...   Common sense would have told me that before she even knows about this, others would have already read through this... and be making puns against me or even her... but to me... I dont find it shameful for one to feel for another... at least I didnt forget I was human... or at least for now... but i strongly suggest against anything that might bother her...   Awh well... though I might not be able to put in an entry for the next 8-9 days, I will still record a physical journal... and perhaps share it online when I return... till then...  Sincerely, Aven Rei (The Limelight Hungry  Vampire)

      02.06.04 [Wen]     Hmmz  perhaps it is not my last journal entry till the trip end... I m using a free internet access in changi airport...   well I only have 10mins left... so I think this entry wouldnt be as long as the others... I will try to go on the internet when I m all the way there... Hope they have a lan shop there...   Glad I have recovered... but still my mind is still in Singapore... S.A....

      31.05.04 (Mon)[N2, Day 53]  To the Readers unknownst to me:    Evening... or for the matter, Afternoon... Usually in Zorpia, my entries are written in the late evening or even sometimes it accidentally cross over to the next morning... I guess the reason for this unexpected entry at this un-unholy time... is cause I cannot sleep till evening... and the reason being... my longing for this girl, Silly Adorable is very likely to be shattered... I have been told by more than one classmate that she is no longer single... I guess it was foolish of me to even think that I could ever had a chance to "love" and put myself in too deep... and I guess I m alittle lost now...   Hmmz this reminds me... this is the first entry in Blogspot... yet I wrote as if there was another... well actually... there is another... or at least was another... Zorpia... but it seems highly unstable... So since there is somebody that is anticipating my theory sessions to be placed on the net... I guess I should just use Blogspot... I was reluctant originally as I m not adept in making a nice page... and my logic of "All or nothing" actually kinda make me wanna stay in Zorpia till I have some online help...hmmz... looking at the IP address for this blog, most of you should have already guess it is written in Japanese... the word I chose(out of my small list of vocab) is Fuzakeru, meaning romp about, joke and flirt... I chose this word as one of the first deeper attempts to create a girlfriend told me... I m very "Hua Xin", meaning flirtatious...ironically... if the guy do not flirt with the girls, do you believe that the girls will do it naturally?   I guess romping about about how I long for Silly.Adorable is also pretty much still romping about... but about the flirting part... well... maybe much later in the future... say 5 years time... but if something worthy comes along... maybe 3months...   But back to me(well this journal is suppose to be about me, aint it?)... well i m currently now sad(like duh... dont take a genius to figure that out)... and now... I guess I m in a Shadow Realm...   Shadow realm??? well lets analyse this alittle... A shadow can be seen as a reflection of what it is true... being that it is the result of something true... but it isnt the complete truth, just as most of our lies are... so techniqically speaking, shadows are half-truths... or actually a lie... So when you are a shadow, you will not be seen as the truth...   Not being the truth, it isnt a lie either... hence a shadow is neither truth nor lie... so when I say I m stuck in shadow realm, it implies that I m stuck in place which I cannot do this nor that... be real nor fake... be something or be the complete opposite...   In this case, I m stuck in Shadow Realm as my kind of a lousy scumbag, I will not leave the idea of talking to S.A as I would rather hear the truth from the horse's mouth(this is only a matter of speech, she aint a horse nor a whore)... But neither can I push on the idea of having her... as if she is already attached, my rules wont allow me to be with her... and worst of all... this affection for her... isnt mutual now that I learnt she might be attached... now left out in the open, I m to the scavengers... as Constellation Beta draws uncomfortably close, I m stuck in another shadow realm...   But in truth, I m not really that against staying with the idea of talking to SA... being that I still kind of "adore"[realise I dont use the word "love"] her... so m I to be blame if I adore her... or even love her? But this kind of attitude will bring me no good... so what the heck   What luck... I originally intended to put in a theory session about living a lie... I guess this would be a good time to do so.   The naive kids... to think that what they learn in schools are truths... well it is true... to a certain extent... in my eyes... the only truths are the truths that are complete... in secondary schools, we learn the existence of ionic bonding... but this is an entire lie fabricated for the convience of memorising for those lower humans.... in actual fact, there isnt a ionic bonding... instead there are only colvalent bonding or slightly charge covalent bonding... now... this... what does it prove? its only a small portion of what we studied... well... if this is a lie fabricated for you to remember by heart... how sure others like this do not exist... for the matter... how much you spent your time remembering... is the truth?   Humans lie... and the recieving ones believes... but not always that the lie was made for the better understanding for people nor the lie which no one was suppose to know its a lie... some lies... are fabricated by self... this are the most serious and damaging lie in life... being that its your creation to blind yourself from the truth, when it comes to a point where your ignorance can no longer cover the lie... wouldnt you have to suffer the fact you lied to yourself?   Humans believe what they wish to believe... sometimes that make them God's equalvilant... but other times... more often than not, it make them lousier than scums...   But dont go thinking that I m lying to myself about S.A... the reason why I m stuck in Shadow Realm in the first place is because I m unwilling to go into a relationship yet I m also longing so badly for her...                                              Sincerely,                                             Aven Rei                                             (The Limelight Hungry                                                Vampire)

        28.07.04 (Wen)[N2, Day 77][Rei, Day 38]        &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Evening... Its weird... How today started out. It seems like the hunted is now the hunter. Being infactuated with SA, it was only natural for me to try to sychronise my plan to coincide with hers. But it seems like today she is prepared for me. The first clear and&nbsp;present sign of this turning of tables was when she changed her plans and sat at&nbsp;a bench which was right opposite of my class. It seems like this meant she knew I was able to observe her. This is indeed worrying. As when one knows that one is being observed, the response is hardly predictable.    &nbsp;  &nbsp; The stares where also accidentally intercepted by my classmate in the canteen. This was indeed worrying. Could this be the start of a new war? As it stands currently, I m now engaged accidentally against a few of my classmate is separate battles. It seems like I have accidentally aggitated a few people. The Anti-Edwin fan club is starting to be ever so present. I guess that is the reason why I started retreating into silence in class, being that this class isnt a class and it wasnt even as good as the sec 4 class. But what can I say?    &nbsp;  &nbsp; I also started to feel the effects of Autumn as I start to feel incapable of caring and instead become more defiant and active in areas not seen by teachers. I guess... this was what I feared most. My character is starting to mutate. This mutation cannot be stopped as no one will be able to be powerful enough... Not even SA... This means that Sasha Rei... will have to go... in another 2more months.... But I do worry about Sasha Rei... Her studies... she isnt doing well.    &nbsp;  &nbsp; The game addiction continues but now that I m not allowed to play after 11, my game session is from 8 or 9 onwards. Hence perhaps I will be able to type more entries.    &nbsp;  Sincerely,   Aven Rei   (The Uncontrollable)

       26.07.04 (Mon)[N2, Day 75][Rei, Day 36]       &nbsp;  &nbsp; Evening... As like the past, I took the Unholy hours of the dark to type this entry... I guess this is due to the fact that the darkness allows me to feel really comfortable... yet sad ironically. In admiration of the Night sky where stars are scarcely visible due the well lit roads of Singapore. I guess the lights only made the scenery more scenic. The ports are clearly visible from the heights I lived at. It is weird though. That when one is in admiration, one will feel awe-inspired and happier in a way while I feel sad upon admiring the sights. Yet this isnt the only form of admiration that had brought about saddness to me. I guess this admirations coupled with age has solemn this once wild and hasty individual. Yet this isnt a good thing.    &nbsp;  &nbsp; If only I was the kid I used to be, asking SA wouldnt have been a problem as I would have gotten it over with the moment I start. This prolonged admiration is perhaps the largest cause for which I feel so weak now. I guess I m a being who cannot adore. Adoring another will blind me from forsight, making me unclear and indecisive. A being like me who despise weakness this much will despise being blindsighted like this and then being unable to change it.    &nbsp;  &nbsp; In addition, retreating into a game to hid from reality. Could the once "Flirt" be reduced to such a hermit? Could it be even possible? Speaking of hermit, during the Parents.Meeting.Session(P.T.M), I was deemed as quiet and inactive&nbsp;by the teacher. Could this really be? When I personally feel I talk too much. I wish that swine could just think this way of herself. I will get to that later. But another highlight during PTM was SA's mum. As she was with SA, I started understanding alittle more on how her family is probably. But I have decided not to use this information as I scared Dawn the last time I told her what I could sense.    &nbsp;  &nbsp; Now about the Swine. In a previous entry, I mention briefly about the Swine who followed me from SRJC to CJC. This bane has now done even more harmful stuff. I will not list them down yet as I m going to turn in soon. But in response to her hostilities and pressence, I m about to start the 101 Reason Why I Dont Eat Swine (101R.W.I.D.E.S) movement. This way, I m able to distract the anti-Edwin sentiments and direct them to Swine.    &nbsp;  &nbsp; To discriminate... it seems like our nature. But discrimation was once a virtue. It is the ability to judge the difference. But due to modern day literature connatations, it has a bad meaning of being direct against a certain characteristics. Yet nevertheless, life is much more fun when you have a direct enemy who you can openly insult. The current day politics are so grey as enemies and friends seem to be 2 jobs that one is able to moonlight with. My discrimination against Petrina is perhaps appearance. But if you are one who believes in my keen senses about personality with appearance and voice then my discrimination is a purely judiciary form of decision rather than an arbitary choice.    &nbsp;  &nbsp; I shall leave you with a joke I made when I realise we were sitting next to a drain while drinking. "Why do we drink beside the chalice of the Swine? I swear she will drink out of the sewage if given the chance!"    &nbsp;  Sincerely,   Aven Rei   (Solemn Prince)

        16.07.04 (Fri)[N2, Day 69][Rei, Day 26]        &nbsp;  &nbsp; Darn... today isnt my lucky day. Seen a Golden Bugle Dragon and a Golden Goblin. But I failed in killing both to two better players. This is extremely frustrating as I trained at the wrong time. The night time in Singapore is one of the highest player rates. Thats the reason why I wish to log on during weekday afternoons. The Golden Goblin instead of dropping a Box Of Luck like the Golden Bugle Dragon, drops a Box Of Kundun. It dropped&nbsp;a Box Of Kundun +1. Wonder what it does...    &nbsp;  &nbsp; The game has gotten on the nerves of my parents as my addiction to the game has been realised. I guessed now that my life is crashing, it was more enjoyable to me to stay in the game world. This game perhaps gave me a kind of a false sense of hope. It is the only time in the day where I seem to have a plan on how to go about it yet it isnt a 100% predictable. School... is now like the school I know during primary school. Yet it isnt as bad though. At least here, I m not in trouble with the teachers. Hehe... Getting in trouble with teachers isnt the ideal way to get about the first&nbsp;9 hours of the day after you waken up.    &nbsp;  &nbsp; But dont think I wish to talk about it now, so I will leave this for another entry.    &nbsp;  &nbsp; Something to add on the factors contributing into the belief that my life is crashing currently is... that even my cupid, Shar has agreed that SA is attached. So... now its almost of definate that SA is an invalid target. This isnt the best timing as 15 of July wasnt only a day ago. Now... I might face with too much energy.    &nbsp;  &nbsp; Now that such a chain events, I guess it was only best that I did good on the promises I made and the duties I forsake in the period of my pursuit for the ever so elusive happiness which was never found. One promise... is to teach my friend how to flirt... well or at least how to start a conversation... But seriously... I m not an expert, just that I had a life built on it once.    &nbsp;  Sincerely,   Aven Rei   (The Lonely)

      14.07.04 (Wen)[N2, Day67][Rei, Day 24]     Hehe... Cant believe my luck! Well... The first time I killed a Golden Bugle Dragon, I was happy... But this time, I not only killed 1. I killed 2 in a row! While training my knight in the deserted corners of Noria, a familiar sound struck me. Immediately I switched to my elf, which I left in Noria, knowing such an event will happen. After killing it, with my assassin, I switched back to my Knight and I walked him back to the city. While walking there, the same sound struck me! This was so... lucky. I switched to my elf and use my assassin again. Though there was another knight already attempting to fight it, he died. Guess he was trying to type to tell me not to fight the dragon. Of course I wouldnt bother if he even managed to type it out. And the box was all mine! I got 3 boxes now. I used 1 to see how it is like. I got a lousy +5 brass pants. Its useless to me as my Knight is a power knight hence cannot wear the Brass series of armor.    While trying to sell the 3rd box at the price of 2 chaos, I bought a +5 vine gloves and +5 leather boots! I earned an addition Million Zen for "buffing" a wizard. And my good friend which I made in the game gave me a few good Items... so cool!    Hmmz... There is hardly any progress in the Universal game as the September Deadline draws closer each day. The deadline is a sort of a morbid end as it is to a certain extent, a resignation to fate. In addition, I will suffer the forfiets that come with this lost of hope as one aspect I still greatly worry about is my inexprience in this battlefield. It will be a totally new board game if I go in later. My distance from reality will be the cause of my long list of failures as it will give the impression I m eccentric.    I guess... this is the second time my prediction came through despite my greatest effort to intervene. This bleak plight only propels me to hide in my homework or the other game, MU.  Sincerely, Aven Rei (The Hermit)

      11.07.04 (Sun)[Rei, Day 21]     Evening... Hmmz so much has happened today... As usual, I woke up rather late due to the game addiction. I truely hate sundays. It gives me the feeling of great amount of sunlight and I truely spite the sun rays. Vamperic Nature? Perhaps...    But due to my late awakening, I missed 15mins of Yu-gi-Oh and Teen Titans!:'( This stinks... as I usually will watch Yu-gi-Oh while recording Teen Titans.    And hence... after my breakfast, I rushed for tution as usual... and was as usual 30minutes late. Seriously, my attitude towards the importance of time is truely horrendous, worst than those early comic characters' names! You truely should browse through the crap they drew when they learnt that the comic business was blooming... Bullet Man, catman and some other very silly names.    But my mind was as usual pretty much miles away while doing work. Its just that I cant seem to concentrate on anything serious this few years. Wonder why. Could it be that one grows dummer as one grows older? Well whichever, it is perhaps the reason why I placed myself in such a lousy situation as to love two and not to get loved in return.    Well... I pretty much rushed home so I could get on the game. It was then a contineous game play. I guess this is how my cousin accumulate such wealth within the game.    And the news of the day is.... I KILLED THE DRAGON! Yea! I finally killed the small fry. Haha. After deciding that its pretty boring being in a party and let the experts do all the work and get the Chaos Gems, Unila Horns, Guardian Angels and Satans, I chose to go back to the homeland of elfs to train my Elf, Crystel.    And while taking an apprentice around and killing alot of monsters, I heard a very unique sound. A sound so familiar to me... and in noria, only means 1 thing... A Golden Bugle Dragon. See... In noria, there is no natural occurring dragons. And the monsters usually make a sound to make their pressence known. In addition, the sound of vain attempts to kill the dragon by wizards can be heard, as lightning bolts strike the dragon. Bolts which the dragon pretty much shake of rather easily. Being an ex-wizard the last time and now still training a wizard, the Lightning sorcery does little damage, say about 1. And one nice breath from the dragon can kill a wizard. Being that they are physically weak and prone to dying. But lightning is the prefered choice as it lowers the chance of getting hit by the dragon since it pretty much throws the dragon around.    Upon arriving to the chaotic scene where newbies massacre the dragon, my assassin found his way to the dragon. The ironic thing is that my assassin does a 100 damage while I could only do 20 damage with each attack. Its weird how a master might be weaker than his summons. But nevertheless, the assassin was highly effective against the dragon. In addition, since he is merely a summon, his health do not matter to me as I caste another as soon as he died... And after dying once, he killed the dragon. And I swoop in too claim the well deserved(well... as the previos entries have said, I tried many times) loot, the coverted Box Of Luck.    This Box of Luck is worth 2 Chaos Gems(more affectionatly known as C). A Chaos gem is worth about a million Zen. Hence a box of luck can be worth 2 million Zen. Boy was I happy.    I gave the apprentice an entire set of orbs! hehe. And gave her about 150k worth of items. Which include an assassin summoning orb and a Running vine boots.    Well I made friends with her. She is one year older than me. And she is all the way in brazil! Gosh... The time difference is about 12 hours! gosh.... wonder how m I ever to see her again. But I saw her because she skipped sleeping and she played till morning, 7am! My parents will scold me if I ever pull of something like this!    Wonder if she is pretty? Maybe she might be my ticket out of this miserable state. And this reminds me. As I re-enter msn messenger while doing up this journal entry, my cupid, Shar seems very excited. She seem to be completely oblivious when I told her SA was attached to a guy. She seemed to have found out something or is planning to pull of something. But she kept me in suspense by telling me that it would be revealed tommorrow. Guess this is the feeling I gave E3 when I tell her storys that werent complete.    But could this mystery that Shar is so excited about the way to revive my confidence in the pursuit of SA? Well... only time will tell....  Sincerely, Aven Rei (Game Fanatic[Stage 2])

      10.07.04 (Sat)[N2, Day64][Rei, Day20]     My addiction to the game Mu has become full-blown as time devoted into it has increased tremendously. I guess this game addiction is the key and sole reason that I kind of forgotten the misery I feel in the other game. Perhaps it is true that children are imune to such pains... and hence by trying to be like them, we can find solice, no matter how little.    News is that SA has already been attached a guy and I found his name. But what the hell. I guess I m going to retreat back to my stronghold, studies, games and hatred. My enthusiasium for this flirtations is perhaps insufficiently funded by maturity as I find that my actions are perhaps not suitable to be with anyone. My prolonged pressense around anybody might very well bring the person great misery rather than great satisfaction as all the faerie tales talk about.    But the game, Mu has also exhausted me greatly as I find difficulty in trying to concentrate on any task in hand. I guess a person like me isnt meant to be a player in any games, including the Flirting Game. But this is not an official declaration of my resignation from the game or to fate. I guess part of me will always want something that I cant get. But back to the concentration problem.    As you realised, this entry is on a saturday yet it is still counted as N2, Day64. N2 means Neo Genesis 2. It counts the days I spent in schools. It is meant to make my life seem alittle shorter and my misery alittle more limited. I guess in both Neo Genesis, I failed. The reason why this entry was counted in the N2 count is due to the A level listening, Mother Tounge. This is perhaps the easiest portion of the exam as one need not possess a high level of word recognition hence so long as one can listen and converse profficently, one should have no difficulty. But I was highly unprepared as bringing the entry proof completely slipped my mind. In addition my arrival, as usual was precisely on time. This meant I have little time to get to my venue. Scanning the board for the class I m suppose to be in, I just got the number and start running. And boy did I mess up. I passed the right class and wondered why was my classmates all together while I was to go to the last class. This was very embarassing to find out that you have turned up in the wrong room. To make it worst, Wx's crush was there.    Speaking of Wx. Hmmz... He might very well be the only winner in the Universal challenge as Hero has quit and I m about to resign soon. He has made considerable amount of progress... I guess his plan to abandon the idea of his sun to go for the moon is wise. As you can see... he will soon be the only existing player, the last one standing! Well... my mischief has accidentally propelled him forward as I kid him by asking him to ask her along for an outing. And downplayed him when she didnt reply! hehe. Without the knownledge that he finally talked to her this morning~    Gosh... I dont want to lose this game... Yet... SA... is my only target... and now that it is gone... Well... Hero has an external life support... While I even consider abandoning my external life support, Sasha Rei for a life of solitude... Gosh... is loniliness to be my only companion for eternaty?  Sincerely, Aven Rei (The Eternally Lonely)

      07.07.04(Wen) [N2, Day 61][Rei, Day 17]     Evening... Hmmmz... It seems like the game has finally gotten to me. I dont mean Mu... instead I mean the "game". It seems like I have made myself known to SA... as the stares something seem rather expecting. It has taken its toll on me though it would have been something most guys would celebrate about. But this game... it just cant go on like this. A possible rift in the dimensions has been birth as I start to see the possibility in the future I truely dread. The failure of me in my studies might be the factor that forces me to drop the game. My concern for my studies is not far shot as it can be seen in the mood and confidence I have for my mid-years. Hearing this will bring great joy to any parent to see how their offspring has grown. But this... I m rather worried.    I guess the song I m listening now would best describe what I m planning now. Linkin Park's Easier To Run. I guess thats pretty much what I feel. The pain of never knowing for sure and being helplessly inhibited from caring or even finding out how the other feels is perhaps rather torturing. I guess this is something that everyone who ever had a crush can relate to. The pain has tired my mind till the state in which I rather not to be known and never remembered. Being a shadow again.    The temptation is there. But I would try to avoid reverting back to it. There was a reason why I intended to start the Evolution. If I reverted to my original form, all I have done is nothing but mere memory.  "Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past Bringing back these memories I wish I didn’t have Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back And never moving forward so there’d never be a path" -Linkin Park    Due to the chain of events, I have decided to pull out of the game by september if I fail to find out. I guess I will never know if I do not find out by then. But my exit from the game will also mean that Rei will come to a complete stop. This is a selfish move but since the original intention is to stop flirting and concentrate on my other aspects of life, Sasha Rei... will have to go... I guess... I kinda told her this before we even started... That both needed each other in a way... without one, I will very likely leave the other...    This is perhaps going to be frowned on by many. But the ultimatum has been decided upon, I feel little need to change. Hence I came from Icy Cold... and still is Icy Cold... Prince Of Ice...  Sincerely, Aven Rei (Prince Of Ice, Mizra)

      06.07.04 (Tue)[Exams, Day 6, Final Battle][N2, Day 60][Rei, Day 16]     Hmmz... I never realised this till I was typing the date out, it have awfully alot of sixes in all my count down. Hmmz... Unholy Divination?    Nevertheless, my day was pretty good, other than the fact that I probably laugh the chinese paper away~ gosh... I was about to cry of laughter as I hardly had any idea what was going on!    But this being the last paper, I guess I should celebrate... My parents??? Well they have accustomed themselves to my constant if not enternal failing of this subject. I guess my passion for this subject can truely be said to be -273.15 degress celius, Absolute Zero.    Well... after the N.E exam which by the way, I laugh throughout, WX and I abandoned the class in their what seemed like a hopeless battle in the soccer courts at that time. Caught Spidy on his webs. Boy did I laugh the whole day~ hee~    Hmmz... I wonder... if I m truely affected by the lunar's gravitational force, will I go phyco by the 15th... being that it would then be largest...    Hmmz and an entry now would be incomplete without me talking about the game. Well it used to be me talking about SA and how I pretty much screw up every other time... But I guess there is no point mentioning something I have no power to change or influence. This evolution(or de-evolution) in topics I think about is probably better. Guess looking at such sad things only results in one getting sad. Hence it isnt hard to see why thoughts of completely quiting the game before I get burned comes to me often. But breaking away from this game also mean that Sasha Rei will have to leave. Cant afford an incompelete change as it might result in me reverting back to the current form. Then again, it isnt the first time I did something this silly as I have quit this game 5 times all in all. And in most cases, I had a chance with somebody, just that either I couldnt bare torturing her by liking another or the fact that I cant afford to let her get harmed. Yet its weird to see how bad I feel each time they find another. It give me this cold and lonely feeling. Guess cant live without them nor can I live with them.    Well there seem to be certain progress in the game. As the dragon forsake me once more. I almost lost my Sword of Salamander! I guess that was the last straw of me ever killing that elusive dragon. But I made a good friend by letting him have it. I guess this is better than killing it. As now, I might get something better than being killed!    Hmmz... well... I just remembered, I left this address on friendster once. I wonder if anyone took the bait. Then again if they did, they would have probably kept quiet and observe or completely gave up reading this due to its lenght. Guess the lenght is the curse and blessing of my journals. But I swear that anyone who have the patience to truely read this would have more than enough patience to spare to finish reading a GP compre~    But something I remembered... Is about my friend's obseesion of this girl, which they address more affectionately as E2. Hmmz... she kinda give me the creeps. I guess its what I sense in her that scares me most. Or perhaps it is the memories attached to her secondary school, nanyang girls. But the first impression of her would have perhaps high alot of guys. That I shall not publish openly, guess if you wish to know, you have to get my journal in the book form. But I kinda neglected it as I have typed alot of entries online and also due to the fact I spend alot of time on the computer. But the obsession that my friend has for her is truely scary. I guess it is the same reason I wish to pull out of the game compeletely. My strange behavior seem to have attracted enough attention as I seem to have gotten her attention and many others... which I sometimes wish I was invisible.... Then again, I m a lime-light hungry person so I wont remain invisible for long.    Awh well... back to the game!  Sincerely, Aven Rei (The Game Fanatic[stage 1])

      05.07.04 (Mon)[Rei, Day15]     Hmmz... I just realised... The date system for the last few days is missing something. During the exams, it should have been counted as N2, Day +1.... Darn~ awh well... tml will be the exams, so no hurry, I can catch up with the count.    Arh... The start of autumn... when I put forward this concept of me actually somehow being influence by the dates and temperature, something that pops out in people's mind would probably be why would the start of Autumn be on july? Well... at first I figured it would probably best fit the calendar being that each season took a equal time and hence everything looks neat and tidy. But it was only quite recently that i realised the significance of july. This took place when I was sleepless again. Hence I laid a blanket on the floor to lay under the window. At this time, the moonlight is very bright. It is almost an equavilant to that of a weak torchlight. While staring in awe at such an unearthly body, the size of the moon became rather obvious. Being that I have always kept a constant look out to the sky, the moon seems bigger than usual.    15th of July is also a celebrations for the chinese, Moon Cake Festival. It is probably due to the fact that the moon appears largest at this time. Hence it had cause the idea that the energy triggered every july was probably caused by the moon's strong gravitational pressense.    But I aint no werewolf or a wolf(pervert) for that matter. It isnt nice to call anyone perverse~ Its so crude and so politically incorrect being that they have to follow your idea of what is right and wrong.    But taking a brief look at the concept of the werewolf, its not hard to see during instances where the moon has affected the living beings on Earth. For example, Moths use the moonlight as a compass and fly towards it during mating season. (Thats the same reason why they are attracted by lamps)    So I m affected by gravity? Anyway, the reason why humans are not very largely affected by the environment as the nature might be is perhaps due to the fact they need no timing for mating, being that they can do it whenever and wherever they please.    Hmmz... I seriously have no regards for my chinese exams which is going to take place tommorrow. Guess I aint going to float this time.    Looking at my handphone's incomplete messages, I found a portion of a lyric of a song which I wish to find. And through the net, I manage to find out that the song was by Mikaila, So In Love With Two.    Reading the lyrics, being that when one listens to a song, more often than not, the lyrics are not fully appreciated at first, I realised how closely my current status is related to this song. Being that I m so addicted to both.    My indecisiveness got me into this mess and has caused me to stay in this state of being weakened. The same weakness is probably the cause of it, itself! Guess somethings are perpetual, being that one leads to the other and hence strenghten the first.  The lyrics read:  "My number one: There could never be no one like you How come I feel this way again My number two: Never tried to tell me what to say or do I'm so in love with two I don't want to push it I don't want to fight But this feeling keeps me up all night  If I only could decide But I can't make up my mind I'm breakin' all my rules because of you You tell me it's not right And it tears me up inside But the problem is I'm so in love with two  Hey, hey, hey I don't know what to do Hey, hey, hey I choose the both of you  My number one: You give me everything I need But some thinks to I'm better with My number two: He's the one that really makes me feel so good I'm so in love with two I don't want to push it I don't want to fight But this feeling keeps me up all night  If I only could decide But I can't make up my mind I'm breakin' all my rules because of you You tell me it's not right And it tears me up inside But the problem is I'm so in love with two  But the problem is I'm so in love with two  Hey, hey, hey I don't know what to do Hey, hey, hey I choose the both of you  Don't want to fight another night Just want to make it right C'mon Ooh, my number one, my number two Somebody tell me what I'm supposed to do My number one, my number two Somebody tell me I'm so in love with two  If I only could decide But I can't make up my mind I'm breakin' all my rules because of you You tell me it's not right And it tears me up inside But the problem is I'm so in love with two  If I only could decide But I can't make up my mind I'm breakin' all my rules because of you You tell me it's not right And it tears me up inside But the problem is I'm so in love with two  Hey, hey, hey I choose the both of you"    In the first phrase, the number one reminds me of how I feel about SA. Being that I wont go for another hence my adoration for her is unique. The ideals of true love is that it is one and only and will not feel the same way to others. People like Shar has been convinced that what I feel is true love. Yet, this has took place many times before. All in all, 5 times. Guess nothing in life is always real.    In addition SA provides me with all the base I need, hence inversely gave me everything I need. Being that she contains the "black strain", she is able to be alot more, and perhaps all I ever wanted.    Yet people think I m better with number two, Sasha Rei. This is perhaps due to the fact that I can have her. Being that I m also able to control her, she will "Never tried to tell me what to say or do". And she do not make me feel so weak and vulnerable as she is living proof of my prowess in the aspect of relationships.    But whether this is the reason why I m kept up at night is yet to be confirmed.~    Hmmz... Well back to other not so serious matters, Mu! Hehe, well its kinda serious, considering the amount of planning and time that goes into it... even BEFORE my chinese exams! Gosh... m I to crash and burn for my chinese~    At least I m now capable of casting meteorites! hee~  Sincerely, Aven Rei (The One In Love With Two)

      01.07.04 (Thur)[Exams, Day 5][Rei, Day 11]     Damn... That stupid dragon~ Well... being addicted to Mu, something that one will want to do is get the "Box Of Luck" which can be obtained by killing the Golden Bugle Dragon. Of course, it being so coveted, it is by nature that it wouldnt be an easy task... well at least for a newbie. After getting killed 4 time while trying to kill this dragon illuminated with golden light, it was killed by another. And hence this box of luck has eluded me once more and with it, a better chance in the game.    Well to look on the bright side of the game, at least I m now capable of running! With a +5 padded boots for my dark sorcerer, Atherin, going to anywhere in the map has become a whole lot easier!    Now, back to reality. Well... Last I left off from SA was my "undying" feelings for her. But as it is, I seem to have lost my appetite for her. Then again, that was nevertheless expected. Not due to the appearance of an "apprentice", rather the reason being this is the first day of autumn.    Awh well... Back to the game~ hee~  Sincerely Aven Rei (The Game Fanatic[stage1])

        08.08.04(Sun)[Rei, Day 50]           Evening... hmmz... It seems like ages since an entry was written... I guess I owe that to the clouded schedule which was filled either by the work estasy or the game addiction. It seems like I have no idea where to start to write the accounts that has filled me within this long period. SA was as usual no progress~      But on the more interesting side, a new nemesis has risen amongst the mist. This opponent is not actually fit to be my rival but I think he is much better than the last wannabe. IS2, petrina isnt my true rival as I do not see as someone who is capable of even putting up a challenge against me. Fat, stupid and not sociable... she is no different from a dodo. But this new opponent makes things more interesting, with a devil's tongue and with a stronger intellectual ability. Canadian Asshole is probably the most appropiate. With a canadian citizenship and the ego large enough to fit as an asshole, this is indeed almost as irraitating as both IS add up together. His constant dissing reminds me of the last wannabe opponent... But both seem equally unfit to pit themselves against me... This jerk blatantly insults Singapore while he studies here... Its truely rude of him to disregard the pride of his host country...      Sincerely,   Aven Rei   (The Judge)
