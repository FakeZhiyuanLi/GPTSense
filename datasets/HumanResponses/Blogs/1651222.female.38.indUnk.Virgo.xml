      Hello all. Plez here. As has been said, the stinkyfinger show was very cool. As always. AC/DC is the world's greatest band, and some would say KISS is the greatest show, but those of us who love stinky know that Ugly and company put on the greatest show ever.  Old 80's story, and not necessarily the best one I remember, but certainly one of my favorites:   At one of the Nightmares shows at O'Malley's in Bristol, which was always an odd place for all of our Johnson City black-clothes army members to show up, the Nightmares played a show that was just weird because there was the O'Malley's crowd, whoever they were, but the sure weren't "us," and then there we all were walking in to the place and just getting the greatest stares from the members. I remember Brian called me out of the crowd and said Plez was gonna play one with the band. Only, we hadn't exactly worked anything up. I sometimes would get up and do "Newport Baby" or later, another one called "Two Different Ways" with the Nightmares, but at that point, we really hadn't come up with anything to do together. So we just played "Louie Louie," which is impossible to play wrong and impossible to sing wrong. I don't remember how it went over with the crowd. Before the show, I'm not gonna mention who, but somebody offered to drive us from a little party in J.C. to O'Malley's. Only this person was, it turned out, quite un-sober at the time. We took an offramp from 181 and missed it, heading straight for a drainage ditch and a big concrete slab that woulda killed us if we were lucky. But Donnie Poole, himself not exactly 100% but still better than the driver, grabbed the wheel and pulled us back on to the offramp. That was only the closest encounter with death I remember at the moment. There were others. That night, we lived to see O'Malley's. Those gigs, to my memory, were even weirder than the ones at Cowboys or whatever that place was called before it became the gay bar that I believe it still is today. That's all for now.

      I was talking to  Bruce not 2 days ago, following the Stinky finger show about whatever happened to the Psychic Sex Turnip fanzine that he published in the late 80's/ early 90's, and like most things from that era it died due to it not being comercially viable (i.e. it did not make enough money to merit it's continued exsistence.) It occurs to me that what Brook has started here is a solution to that age old problem of economics in that it is A) free to the reader and; B) free to the publisher.  The Stinky Finger show was great, as always, and it was wonderful seeing everyone again. It was like a high school reunion, albeit for a reformatory. I look forward to reading everyone's postings in the coming days, weeks, etc,

      YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS to the Blog! I've been talking about some kind of Nightmares-related list-serve for ages, just for the preservation of the oral history of it all, but, as Brook says, the setting up of it was what bogged me down. The important thing right now is to collect these stories before we get any more senile; they can be sifted through and organized when the collection swells to appropriate tick-like-ness.  One of the things that bogged me when confronting the set-up of a list-serve was the elusory quality of that age, that era, that area. We all know what we're talking about when we speak of "then," but it's nearly impossible to invoke with words like "eighties" and "Johnson City." It was the parallel inverse universe, the anti-eighties and a lot of UN-Johnson Citians doing very UN-Johnson City things. It was about looking around a homogenized hillbilly town and seeing a few points of consciousness staring back at you from amongst all the glassy-eyed possoms, and figuring out that if an experiment like yourself was going to survive you'd better make some friends.  I am passionately convicted of two things with regard to this project: 1) that because of the intellectual ghetto-ization of the Appalachian region, most of the people involved failed to see the sub-culture as an achievement on a par with say, Montparnasse in the 1870's or Chelsea in the 1960's (I can here you laughing from here- laugh all you want, but realize you are proving my point for me.) I suggest that if you could travel back in time to some fabled fringe society, you would be startled by how small and rag-tag and very JC-like it all was. No such ever looks world-shaking and influential before myth makes it out to be so. No one walks around bathed in the unholy glow of media romanticism while it's really happening. Our art form was that we assembled. Some came to sing, some came to dance. You belonged to the experience as much as it belonged to you.  Which brings me to 2) that because of its very nature, any book written about this phenomenon from the point of view of only one or two authors would be fatally incomplete. It happened because we were all there; the more voices we can hear from now, the richer and more authentic this tapestry will be. No one's got it right; no one's got it wrong (although I'm sure the arguing will add some spice.) Each has their unique tale to tell, so pop open a Rolling Rock and drink a toast to Roshoman.  That spiel over with, today I found myself thinking about the chloroform party, summer of '86, out on the Old Jonesborough Highway, courtesy of Kevin Hurley and a white, diaper-like rag. It was somebody's birthday, although I can't remember whose. (Wonder why.) Somebody ate handfuls of dog food out of an enormous bag. It seems like the Southside Sheiks were involved in some way. Chip and Brian were living in this old log house? The next day I had to be in Music Appreciation class. I had the shakes and discovered that chloroform smells sweet when you sweat it out. We sat in wooden chairs in an auditorium, and since it was the first opportunity I'd had in college to carve anything into a desk, I did. Just don't ask me what. I don't remember how the party evening started out; I think there had been a cookout, but I wasn't around for that. I remember sitting on the stairs with Lynne and smoking cigarettes (hers.) Her dress kept tearing. I recognized the deterioration as light damage. Sun rot, fabric people call it. It happens frequently to the linings of draperies. I imparted this to her. She seemed polite but probably not overwhelmed with the exact diagnosis of her dress. This is what I remember. This, and Kevin Hurley with a big white rag.

      This Blog is for swapping stories and ideas about the Johnson City music scene.    There’s lots of good nostalgia-izing to do, but there’s also lots of new music to be recorded, new songs to be written and new stuff to make and sell. Already, it looks like there’s a handful of documentaries being produced. Maybe, one day, Johnson City will be associated with its own aesthetic described as “Appalachian Chic” or “State of Franklin Gothic.”  This weekend was the Stinky Finger, “Descent of the Testes” tour (er, show) at the Casbah and if you weren't there -- then you are going to have to wait until their next reunion, probably next year. And don’t give me that shit about them never doing it again. We’ve heard THAT before. They’ve been playing so much over the last few years, “reunion” isn’t even an accurate description anymore. They’ve got fans, new material and CDs to sell. That’s more like a regular-playing band -- albeit a very slack regular-playing band -- than most bands you’ll see in Nashville who only get together to showcase to a producer, or a label, or whatever ass they are sucking on at the moment.  The presence of so many video cameras and trying to answer interview questions about the band, put me in a contemplative mood for the drive back to Nashville. Why did that scene thrive and continue on while many other 80s music scenes just kind of went away. Obviously, we can’t bottle up the talent and take it elsewhere and expect for the scene to go with it. We tried. The scene is site-specific and the original talent can either stay or go. By and large, the talent left (but it still has a place to call home).  In the next few weeks I’ll be adding functionality here. We need a place to put photos and music files. I’m thinking a link to mp3.com might be good -- then again -- I might just move all this crap to a server in the house. At any rate, pull up a seat and stay awhile.

      I never gave much creedence to the gun sale story, although like James I heard it too. Fact is, in the U.S., there are very few legal restrictions on the private sale of guns. Full Auto requires a class 3 license, but semi-auto is easier than selling a car to someone. (a car at least requires registration.) Heck, if you want a semi-automatic, just go to Wal-Mart and buy one! As to the timing, it was probably about the time of Iran/Contra,,, another weapons transfer that went unpunished!!

      OK...I may be wrong about Sam.  Rumor had it that the reason all those cats cut out and left Burt to run the place was due to the sales of semi-automatic guns to an undercover agent in the club during off hours.  I often wondered about the validity of this storie due to the harsh penalties for such actions...even in those days.  If you know the real scoop on this please let me know.  I remember the first time I met Bleu.  I was having a party for Angie's b-day at that place I lived in with Susan and Vicki.  Stinky was doing a rehearsal/show in the living room.  when we were finished this "old" drunk dude walks up to me in the kitchen and starts railing about how "the shit you guys are throwing down is too hot man".  He blathered on for a while about keeping it real.  The next thing I know is Angie is telling me to get Frankie away from her mom.  Yes, her mom showed up to party and make sure everything was above board with the event.  However, it seems that she had a few and started propositioning Frank in and around my room.  She has passed on now and I will say that though she was an odd bird she does get much respect from me as her life wasn't a bowl of cherries yet she fought hard the whole time to keep everything together.

      Nightmare Genesis: Hello Bloggers. I’ve been enjoying your amazing fucking memories. How the fuck do you people remember all that shit! Between the chloroform, acid, draft beer, bong-hits and lack of sleep—it should not be physiologically possible (ah—but the kicker is, you can’t remember where you parked today—hard-drive is full).  I remember our first gig. John, Kurt and Donnie Poole had booked a gig and needed a singer. Yes they booked a gig and did not even have a band—very nice. I was playing bass w/Bleu Jackson (the first name IS spelled correctly) and the bugeouse blues band. I was jonesing for something more than shuffles in “G”, so I worked up some rockabilly shit to do at open hoot. They saw me, and said – this guy doesn’t totally suck, so why not ask him to sing.   We worked up 10 songs in John’s basement and in a couple weeks, there we were, in the parking lot of the McDonalds on Market St.  No flatbed, just on the blacktop. We were billed as Brian and the Howling Tomcats of Doom (the “Doom” quickly disappeared. There were about 10 people there—and 3 we didn’t know, Mike n Lynne and Johnny Hicks. We were paid in food. A couple weeks later we played an encore at the McDonalds on Walnut St. Again…more food—and more people.   What sticks out are the rehearsals where I was trying to sing and play guitar—I could barely play guitar (I’m sure there are those of you whom I have played that are right now saying “you still can’t play”…fuck you) and it hurt to play an F chord, so I remember just playing the chords I could play without hurting. John, Kurt and Donnie were very cool, they could play great and had just graduated high school—I was very envious. I was 24 and would regularly hear comments like – “man, when I get to be your age, I hope I’m not still playing in a garage band (translation: I hope I have a life).   We did some open hoots afterward and people started coming out. Boy, we thought we were hot-shit. They offered us our own night at Down Home and before that gig we changed our name. John came up with Brian and the Nightmares. He and Kurt wanted to change it later on—many, many “band discussions” about dropping the Brian, cause it gave the perception that it was me with a backup band-- but it was too late—the name was ingrained. Of course I argued to keep it just the way it was…I mean, fuck man, shit…I was Brian.

      I thought "Sam" and "Burt" were the same guy.....but then again it seems one was from Iraq, one was from Iran, and one was from Jordan.....no, I still think Sam and Burt were different names for the same guy.....and depending upon which country the average college student hated the most he was from any of the three countries....anyway, more later on the early history of the pub, I was there and saw it all,,, but it being a bar, it will take me a while to piece it all together.

      WHAT I CAN REMEMBER  1.  I was finally out of school!  I had been given a new drum set (the old white Tama Swingstar kit) by my father as a graduation gift.  I was given the choice of the drums or a car.  I sometimes wonder if that wasn’t the biggest little decision of my life.  Anyway, my graduation present and I were playing in this glam rock band called Damage Inc. or “Damn It I’m Constipated” as many including myself would come to call it…ha ha.  It was a really bad name for a band that did a good job of doing some schlock music.  It was the brainchild of guitarist Steve “Wolf Boy” Blevins.  The rest of the band consisted of Mark Eads on guitar (went on to do Scull Soup…a rock ass band of the best bunch of people you’ll ever have the pleasure of meeting), Pat Malone on bass (later to do Punchin’ Judy), myself, and Steve’s right hand man Bobby-----(brain laps) on vocals.  One day Pat came to a rehearsal and said he’d heard of a new dance club that was having an all ages night once a week.  It was called Club Venus and was located behind the Italian Pizza Pub.  We went down one night to check it out and knew immediately that this was the place for us to play.  It was filled with our target market… young girls.  The Guy running the club (not Burt but the other guy…help me if you can remember) seemed both apprehensive and quite shady.  He had never had a band in his club and didn’t understand how he could make any money off of it.  That was until he saw the attention we garnered from the girls in the club.   He agreed to let us play the next week.  We played a couple of shows to great crowds…of young girls…and had a lot of fun, but it wasn’t my bag.  I had always been the guy who liked that weird “punk-new wave stuff”, you know…no need to list them as all of you were me.  This led me to want to play with a another act at the same time to satisfy my jones.   It was a geek rock outfit made up of friends from high school band.  We called it Beat Your Mother With A Putrid Herring.  It was literally the first name that came out of my mouth.  I said it stumbling to tie words together…a joke.  Russ loved it.  It was a working title at best I thought.  The members changed almost every show, but Russ Onks, Mike Hilliard and myself were the constants.  Wolf Boy and Bobby didn’t understand why the hell I was so interested in doing this comedy act with tunes like “Doctor Ruth” and “The Time Warp”.  Pat and Mark however got the joke and appreciated it for what it was, a lot more fun.  Lets face it, who would you rather spend your time with, Mike Hilliard or Steve.    BYM wanted to play out.  I had been to this listening room of a bar called “Down Home” the previous year  with my late friend John Chandley to visit with Ed Snoderly and catch an acoustic show.  I told the guys that they had a writer’s night for unknown acts to come play original material.  We arranged a slot on the next show and practiced till the cows came home.  We were unsure how a venue with a bluegrass/folk vibe would react to a rock band.  Our only hopes were pinned on the fact that we had heard about Brian and the Nightmares, a rock band that had been playing there to a good response.   We were a little nervous…full of piss and vinegar…and ready to dork out hard.

      One fast, overwhelming memory I have of Ditty is at the Down Home when the Nightmares were playing. I hadn't known Ditty long; it was really crowded and hot, might have been the summer of '89. Some drunken hombre had been rubbing himself suggestively against Ditty's backside for almost an entire set of songs, under the guise of "dancing." When at last she'd had entirely too much of him, she turned around and VERY SWEETLY announced, "If you prod me one more time with your penis, I'm going to tear it off and feed it to you." He suddenly remembered something very urgent he had to go do, and was not seen again that night, nor do I think ever.

      Ditty here.  If anyone is in need of an old fart's memories from the 80's on up, you'd best ask me, I suppose, not that I guarantee I'll remember anything - the overwhelming image I have from those years is seeing my son perform in Heather's black lace pantyhose at the Down Home on New Year's Eve.  By the way, for anyone who already doesn't know about them, I run three web sites in a partnership with my husband Ernie (yes, I got married - isn't that a hoot?) called  urlLink Dear Aunt Nettie ,  urlLink The Museum of Depressionist Art  and  urlLink The Gallery of the Unidentifiable .  It's fun and it keeps me off the streets and out of trouble.

      The Dialogue benefit would've been in April of '88. It took me a while to decide whether it was '87 or' 88, but I finally nailed it down because I remember going to Barb and Ann and Paul's place on Holston after school to change clothes. If it was '87 then I would've still been living on the tree streets. I really think Plane Jane themselves may have played that night as well, although I don't know how that would've happened unless it was through them being neighbors with Brook and John at Melubro Court. And I guess Brian and Heather were living there too at the time, in number 8. Anyway, there were three bands. I was mostly occupied with taking money and handing out literature to promote student activism in the era of Reaganomics. Ann gave me a break for a little while, I remember. She had that great jacket that had all the archie mcphee toys sewn into a little fringe along the back. I was down there for ages for some reason, watching Hicks climb up into the ceiling and change light bulbs, dangling from these flimsy little fixtures and doing pre-"mystery science theatre" voice-overs to whatever was on tv. (In the front? In the back? Was there ever a tv in the back? Doesn't seem right.) Brook had gone out of town on some campus rabble-rousing, or maybe the model UN at Appy State. The background on the indebtedness was, Dialogue never started out to be a newspaper; it was just a student organization, an attempt to revivify Brook's earlier "Students for Peace and Justice" by inviting conservatives or anybody with a point of view to participate, so that we weren't just all the time preaching to the converted. Some kid we didn't know just insisted it would be this brilliant idea to get a 606 loan and put out a paper, and of course vanished before the first issue ever had to be laid out or taken to the printer or distributed...or the loan paid back. I never did see the figures on that (I was the poetry editor, for christ's sake) but I assume the benefit must've cured a large part of our problem, because no irate SGA senators ever repossessed my car. I also remember it getting freezing cold and Hicks loaning me his black leather jacket- underneath it all, perhaps some species of a southern gentleman? Nah...

      Ah, one can only wish that more of your performance-art concepts had made it to the stage, Prof. Ugly...Never (in those days) being quite sure which side of your mouths you boys were joking out of, if not actually both, an entire set of let's say, "Afternoon Delight" or "Chevy Van" and/or a pre-emptive strike of an entire Plane Jane set would've cleared that issue right up. I think the first show I ever saw was the benefit y'all played with the Nightmares to help drag mine and Brook's impoverished little student newspaper,  the Dialogue, out of the fiscal hole, when you called yourselves "Ordinary Mary" as a stab at the Jane-sters. Did I say thanks for that, ever? Merely an oversight, I assure you. Have your sub-committee speak to my sub-committee about it.  Julie Fann used to tell the story that on that night, John Hicks was inscribing everyone's hand with a particularly trenchant summary of their personality, in indelible sharpie ink. On her hand, she said, he wrote, "Fuck me now." Hicks was a wonder of nature and a force all his own. He refused to mark on my hand in any fashion whatsoever, thereby declaring me either the stealth bomber or the absolute zero of humanity.

      Chris: I know the guy you are talking about, I think it was Steve. I run into him from time to time, for a while he was working at the Hay House (or living there) in Kingsport. When I was still a probation officer I would see him there. Later I ran into him at scouting events, and I'm not sure why he was there either. Really nice guy, but was from a different mold from the rest of the Dracula gang. As I read your first entry today, I remembered that The Olde West had a full time bartender on staff, but served neither liquer nor beer. The bartender was a recovering alcoholic. Strange business model. To complete the off stage troika of bad nicknames, our sound/light man was Ric Milhorn, who you nicknamed "Hell Hammer." Ah the memories are flowing back like Pabst Blue Ribbon on quarter beer night at the Horseshoe Lounge.... As to your abilities as a director, anytime you want to put on another show here give me a call, I'm in. Especially if you let me be the "won''t feed a line to the forgetfull actor a week before opening, stage managing Nazi" again!  By the way, for anyone interested in party games, as a result of the Dracula production, Stinky Finger is a mere five (5) degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon.

      In my defense, what Chris fails to mention is that was probably the tenth time that night I had been sent by him to quiet down the "chatty" actors. Also worth noteing is that calling a conversation between Puke and Coker "chatty" is akin to calling a Husquavana chainsaw "a mild hum." That not withstanding, I did later feel bad as the offending party in this case was as I recall Pat Tabor, who was normally quiet as a church mouse.  Working with  Chris and company was an interesting experience to say the least. We had no budget for props, so we found ways to manufacture what we needed from what we found laying around. A cane was required for Dracula to break a mirror in one scene, and we had to obtain both from what we had on hand. We stole the mirror from an apartment originally used for the night watchman, and as it was broken each night it became smaller and smaller, until in the end it was the size of a postcard. As it was taped to it's backing to prevent glass from flying into the crowd it became harder and harder to break. The cane began it's life as the coat rack in the lobby. Each night Chris and I would steal another section and I would take it home and lovingly craft it into a gentleman's cane, which was broken the next night trying to smash an increasingly smaller mirror. In addition, we needed a gunshot to coincide with the attempted shooting of Dracula. For this we used caps and a 12 lb. hammer we had found amongst the tools in the back room. Every night Chris complained that the gunshot was not loud enough, so that in the end we had about 6 rolls of caps duct taped to the head of the hammer. When I struck it to what we used as an anvil, the shock was so strong it blew the hammer out of my hand, and that night's shot was followed with the sound of the hammer slamming into the floor. Then there was the day of the crickets. The Olde West was teetering on the brink of finacial disaster at the time, and so to sell more tickets they had matinee shows for one of the local middle schools (Blountville I think). Instead of having dinner for the kids, the theatre served free popcorn. Imagine 250 children eating popcorn in unison, and then imagine trying to preform or hear stage ques in what sounded like a room full of gigantic crickets.  Until reading Chris's posting I had not thought of Dracula in years. Now I remember why.....

      Thanks ever so to all new JC bloggers out there (hail, UglyUgly)-- It is a more formidible task than I realize, sometimes, for even good writers to reconstruct emphemera from their past lives. I was talking with Scott Plez about this just last night. (We went to see an AC/DC tribute band- from Knoxville- at the local sports bar. Who says the surreality has stopped?) It is my hope to achieve, in this electronic format, the same sort of thing that happens whenever a bunch of us old-timers get together at something like a Stinky reunion show and start those conversations where one tiny shred of memory leads to another, and a contradiction, and usually a few revelations as well. We always end up saying, "Damn, we shoulda taped that," but there is something so invasive about dragging recording devices into casual social settings. I just hate that. But I'm hoping this will take off in the way those beautiful, spontaneous conversational rambles always seem to. We're hoping to start posting pictures on the blog soon, which I think will help. So just remember, if you want to avoid me coming to your house with a tape recorder, POST!

      I may have a very low-fi copy of some of the Paralyzers' tunes on an unmarked cassette somewhere.  "I Break Down" is a great song that I use to do in my blessedly brief solo career before playing in The Bystanders (b. 1997 d. 1999  RIP).   Other tunes I tried to cover were the Nightmares "Look the Other Way"  (GREAT bass line John) and "Daydream"  Did anybody go to the Nightmares' Knoxville gig at Geronimo's?  Oh, the humanity!  Dirt floor.  A guy sportin' a Mohawk screaming: "Play more Bowie!"  First time I heard the Nightmares cover the Dead's "Truckin'."  My friend Munch tripping over the owner (doing God knows what) on the way to the bathroom located at the end of a pitch-black corridor.  Question:  What current bands (local to JC or otherwise) do you think would have dug (or sound like they were from) the JC mid-80's music scene?  Wilco? The Strokes? Death Cab for Cutie? Guided By Voices?                                                                                                 P-O-L-L-UTION

      Hey Allan Maki! I remember you...  The Paralyzers! I would love to have a recording of theirs! What an understated, underappreciated band they were. We've run into their drummer a couple of times in an Atlanta band called Donkey USA.   Here's a 63 Eyes link... http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/44/63_eyes.html and Eyes' frontman Todd Burge... http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/37/todd_burge.html

      This is a noble cause.    I hope to contribute what I can to it.  Only a few of you may remember me:  Allan Maki.  I surmise that I am a few years older than most of the bloggers that have posted thus far and, due to that, I was on the periphery of the whole "scene" back then.  I finished up my undergraduate time at ETSU in '84 and was a working stiff in the mid 80's when JC exploded (musically speaking).  I did get out and see a lot of shows.  Mainly Nightmares, Plane Jane and a couple of Sticky Finger shows.  I remember going to see Gov't Cheese, The Paralyzers, Blooshrooms, 63 Eyes, Uncle Green, Dillon Fence and beholding Southern Culture for the first time at the Highlander.  I was living on 10th Ave for a time in '87 when the Nightmares used our basement space for practice, and what not.  I recall coming home from work one day and seeing a neighborhood boy of about 10 twisting away on the sidewalk outside our house as the Nightmares jammed in the basement.  Will publish more when time permits.  Elvis' brain in a jar,  Allan Maki

      FROM DREW VANCE (who can't post to the blog from work at Gibson -- Brook)  I can recall being stuck in NC after my father died, feeling as though I was totally missing out on everything.  Finally, the bands were playing out, John had a new, good bass--the Daion, I think; it was used for the first N'Mares tape --Donnie had a hot Mustang, Ryalls had gotten those huge black Tamas, and the Rellava guy from Bleu Jackson's band was singing with them.  Kurt had even moved out of his Mom's place.  Meanwhile, I was floundering in Gastonia, trying--and failing, no doubt--to affect an outsider, alterna-image.  In reality, I was 22, living with my mom, working at a pawnshop, and had a mullet that reached halfway down my back.  Dear God, it was miserable.  Thank god for The Replacements, Jason and the Scorchers, Husker Du, Let's Active, Bangles--"All Over the Place", natch--Lone Ryders, Hoodoo Gurus, and above all of course, REM.  I craved the days that JC folks would come down to see the Scorchers at Kidnappers' in Charlotte.  It made me feel connected to the JC scene, such as it was at its nebulous stage.   Roland Tester was working a construction job in Charlotte in the summer of '86--the hottest on record, I think, with temperatures higher than in Phoenix--and he and I would make the occasional weeknd trip to JC to see the old gang.  They were hanging out with these freaks whom I had never heard of.  Mike and Lynne?  Johnnie Hicks? Ann, Barbara, Paul...who the fuck were these people?  And why were they turning my innocent little nerd friends into beer-sloshing slobs?  I had to go back to JC to save them from the evil outsiders.   When I finally made up my mind to go, I ran to JC.  Flopping on couches, going out of town with the Nightmares, riding my bike all over town, eating nothing, and--best of all--honest-to-god sex with real girls (in my case singular; I wasn't a player).  All the stuff I missed over 2 years in NC I had to cram in as fast as possible.  Goddam, was it fun.  And FINALLY getting my band.  I was one of the Stinkies, and part of the larger "scene".  Suddenly I was one of the evil outsiders I had come to fight, and all was beautiful and well.  We CREATED our scene, we owned it, it was ours.  I recall when Gov't Cheese, The Dusters, etc, first came to town.  All of us "musicians" held them at arms length...who were they to be coming into our scene?  After all, they hadn't been invited like 63 Eyes, Fab Motion, etc.  They had just strolled in to capitalize on what we started.  Such jealous bitches...    Looking back on it, I think the best part of it all is that it lasted.  Even though with everyone gone, Club Venus is still there, still booking bands because the Nightmares, Stinkyfinger, Scott Pleasant, Plane Jane, Beat Yo Mother, GSI, Electric Middle Earth, et al took it over.  The Down Home was cool, but it was so un-rock & roll.  Even when the scene died and we had to resort to massive LSD consumption, it was still cool, 'coz we were so much cooler than anyone else.  The fact that the scene died after a couple of years is for the best, I think, before it had a chance to lose its identity.   I think my favorite memory of it was the 2nd time that Uncle Green played there, and they had a full house.  The Do It Now Foundation--god, how do I remember that?--opened, and I remember them saying that Uncle Green was gonna be up in a few minutes.  That was greeted by polite but highly charged applause; we were really chomping at the bit to see Uncle Green.  It made the scene seem SO real for a great band to be there, loads of people there to see them, and for me to have escaped NC.  If I could have frozen the scene at any stage, that would be it.   Thanks to everyone who saw the Stinkyfinger show on 7/27.  The best rock experience I ever had.  Great time for us, and deeply appreciated.

      Wow...does anyone have email for Martin? The little kibble-eater should be here to give an account of himself. I also never knew Brook and Heather met in the Philosophy department. More on that later.  But first I must ask about this place O'Malley's. Was it what later became the Offshore? (I'm guessing because of the Bristol locale.) The weird place in Johnson City was indeed called Cowboys, and it was actually my favorite place to see the Nightmares, mainly because they made them play something like four sets a night. I think that was every song they had, twice. Which was great for me. Every Thursday night, all summer long, 1986. There was that mechanical bull in the middle of the dance floor, which was kind of a nuisance but could be useful if you were trying to avoid someone. And speaking of covers, this is how I knew I'd found a home...The first time I saw the Nightmares, as I walked through the door at Cowboy's, I was greeted by "Suffragette City." My jaw hit the floor and pretty much stayed there. Something I could get behind? I'd already had a contretemps with JC alterna-culture in the form of James Arwood, fannying about with his mohawk and PiL jacket, along the lines of "sticking your neck out this far for image eradicates all your self-professed nilhism. If you were a real nilhist, you'd just wear sweatpants from K-Mart, like me." Never one to pass a hornet's nest without swatting at it with a big stick, me. I was burning my bridges before they were even built. Nevertheless, if there was a band in town that could play "Suffragette City" and do it justice, I knew something was happening that I had to keep my eye on.  The first place I met Heather was at Cowboy's. In the bathroom. She was wearing a fabulous red mini-dress with maribou trim around the hem. She was attempting to comb her hair, which was terribly tangled, and just ripping chunks of it out. She was saying to Lynne, "Maybe I should take another one. Do you think I should take another one?" and Lynne was saying, "For god's sake, no." I was trying to wash my hands and get out without opening my big mouth and letting mom come out, but every individual hair that was left on Heather's head screamed to me for help. I took her hairbrush away from her and finished brushing out her hair. I was pretty sure she'd never remember it, and in fact I think Heather and I "met" each other a grand total of eleven times before she would remember me at all, and then only because I told her to quit bothering. It probably came across as snotty, but only 50% of it was miffed arrogance on my part; the other part was just truly a feeling of why should it matter. It was at least as amusing as it was offending, and I felt really prepared to embrace that state of affairs, but I don't think it went over that way. I remember where we were; Brook and I had stopped at Lynne's, and she and Heather were having a cherry pie baking contest. Holy domesticity, batman.

      Hey Lisa! Martin Patrick was one of kibble eaters at the choloform party. There might have been others, but Martin is the one I remember. Cabin co-proprietor, Chip Dollinger had a really big dog/wolf (what was his name?) and no less than a hundred pounds of bagged dry food stacked was on the porch. If you sat on the stack, your feet wouldn't touch the ground. The pieces of kibble were so big they seemed like sausage balls. Popping the kibble was such a lovely gesture.  Bill, I think you were the first person I met in JC. I was in Joe Corso's Political Life class and you were hanging out in the poly sci dept and introduced me to Heather who was standing at the opposite end of the hall in the Philosophy department. That is hilarious about you guys drinking at John's.  Here's a story and a rant.    BURNING HOUSE OF LOVE  One cold nite Nina and I were the only ones home at the Hippie House. The fire was dwindling, we were broke, hungry and butt-ass cold. Wood needed to be chopped, and for some reason (probably herbal in nature) we felt that we were not up to the job. The only food in the kitchen was popcorn, peanut butter and corn cob jelly. So we popped the pop corn and mixed it up in a white plastic bowl with the pb and jelly. We were sitting back to back for warmth on top of the cold wood stove as the last embers were dying out, eating the sticky mixture with our fingers, when we heard what sounded like an army invasion on the porch (thick boot heels on cranky wooden floorboards). The door flies open and Susan swirls inside followed by Brian, Donnie, Martin, John, Mike, Lynne, Heather, Robert Blevins and who knows who else. Every person who came thru the door had a 12 pack of beer and was wearing a black leather jacket except for Susan (woolen poncho) and the Blev (a light gray Members Only jacket). Nina and I, with had our hands in our white plastic mixing bowl, could not have been more happy to see MEN capable of chopping some damn wood and building a fire.  Brian stuffed the stove FULL of wood. The stove-pipe glowed red and the varnish on the antique mantle bubbled and wheezed. "What a bunch of reckless boobs," I thought. But, they brought beer, so I bit my tongue and then watched as Donnie (mumbling something about Quaddafi's enemy lines) "shot down" my battery-operated, flying airplane which was tied to the ceiling, whizzing in circles. John donned my pink heart decorated scooter helmet and repeatedly head-butted the wall trying to knock a hole in the plaster. Escaping the madness I went outside to the porch and spotted Martin across the street at the pay phone. I went over. He was calling Paul Westerburg -- just to chat, I suppose. It was his second choice. Peter Buck wasn't home.   Right now I am listening to Westerburg's new record (Stereo/Mono) thinking it couldn't possibly be 17 years ago that all us young bastards were high on "Tim," thinking there was something special about that place in time. Standing on our toes in china doll shoes, we could almost see past the horizon to a post-Reagan, post-MTV, post-pre-packaged-bullshit world. Seemed something meaningful and good was about to happen.   There's no point getting older if you can't claim a bit of wisdom along with your gray hair, so, here goes: The meaningful and good stuff was happening right in front of us. It was and (still is) up to us to head-butt the wall, to shoot down enemy planes, and to place a call (or two) to "greatness" -- just to chat. We thought the world was fucked up then, with Reagan and Iran/Contra, and the "War on Drugs" and shitty corporate rock and roll. Take a look around. The stakes are higher now and our responsibility is greater because we wield more power as full-grown adults. Don't settle. Demand the good shit (from ourselves and our leaders -- or better yet, lets just lead for a while). Write more songs. Blog. Have a good day.

      I remember Andy Boy. Andy Boy and "The Plain Truth" represent the Genisis of the J.C. music scene, or at least the expulsion from paradise. The Plain Truth was arguably a Knoxville band, although as I recall only one or two members were from Knoxville. Thier drummer, Tommy, is still in the area and works for Bridge Computers last I heard. Anyway, how many folks out there remember the Shooters Lane show? It was I beleive the first punk show in J.C. Final Curtain would not come along for 6 months to a year later (the fall of 1984) Unlike Andy Boy, Final Curtain and The Plain Truth  did drink at the time. Alot. Often in John Smith's basement.

      Ah, good one Scott. The median surfing event… That was one “off-roading” experience I was glad not to be part of. :^P  As far as the turnip goes, I believe we have most of those archived in a file folder. A great mag!  Let’s start at the beginning of my music career (and quite a few others in JC). There was a “band” called Andy Boy. Yes, it was named after the produce company. This “band” consisted of quite a few of my musical friends and was formed in high school. Our deal was writing and recording songs on the weekends. Since none of us drank at the time, we were very productive. I still have 20 or 30 cassettes and many open reel tapes of our music; but that’s another story.  The great thing about Andy Boy was our musical timeline. We essentially went through a 10-year average band lifespan in a year and a half. We had: 1.	Our skiffle period 2.	Our heavy rock period 3.	Our experimental period 4.	Our breakup and split into two bands period:  a.	The Acid Cows b.	DKM (Drew, Kurt & Mark) Sorry guys, I can’t remember the name. 5.	Our get back together and suck period. It was good stuff and great training ground for later musical careers.  By the end of its existence, probably 30 people had played in Andy Boy. I might be bold in saying, but quite a few of the most influential musicians in the JC scene played in AB at one time or another. In the next few months, I want to start a timeline/family tree of the musicians in JC. Also, I’m going to start digitizing the best of AB stuff before the tapes all rot and start a companion site that is music of this time.  I’m done rambling’ now. Keep the stories coming!

      Shit. I remember those damn games. One game in particular where I decided to be the star QB. I was throwing, running the option, kickoff returns-- I was everywhere. Man, I was good. I woke up the next day and could not walk. Really, I could not walk. My little stick legs had given up. For three days I would hobble to the refrigerator and back to the couch.

      Brooke: I think there usually was beer in the end zone, or at least on the side line. I remember the enormous pain I was in for days after the first game. I remember Frankie smoking Marlboros during plays, and that he could hurl a ball forever. And I remember not being able to catch a pass all day. Also it seems the gay community from quarterbacks provided some of our best players, but I can't remember any of their names. T. Cecil was instrumental in organizing the games, perhaps he can contribute more.

      watching the titans be humiliated today reminded me of the football games we used to have on sundays at the intramural field at etsu... frankie, john, brian, donnie, tony, ralph, bill, mike and lynne, onlookers -- i can't remember the whole crew. what i do remember,  tho, is ralph dosser stiff-arming a poor blonde woman on the field, and, when donnie made a touchdown in black boot and jeans. he was pleased with himself for some time after that. someone must have told him there was beer at the end of the field -- :). i never knew how difficult football was until then. also amazed at the ability of us to actually organize and show up to do something so physical.

      Hello everyone.  Mark here.  Long-time subscriber; first-time caller.    I was the Nightmares' drummer.  I was the guy with the mullet and a bit of a temper.  GREAT TO SEE ALL OF YOU AGAIN.....wow,  I've been reading this stuff for a few weeks.  Pretty intimidating room.   I was still in high school when many of you were studying mysticism and such,      >ahem Someone in here mentioned Claudia.....where the hell is she now?  She and Linda Barnett were roommates at one point...(1989???)  and they came to my rescue once in Charlotte, NC ... (Longer story) Took me to the beach, got me drunk and nursed me back to health over the course of two weeks after I split from the Nightmares in 1990. I am forever grateful for their kindness.   I watch this site occasionally when time allows at work and will gladly answer any questions you have for me.  Much love to all....

      Final Curtain at various times consisted of:  Bruce Honeycutt, Frank Spangler, Donnie Pool, John Smith, Martin, Jeff Campbell, Heather, and myself (version one)  Bruce, Frankie, John, Roland Tester and myself (version B, "the golden age")  Bruce, John, Roland, Wayne Winkler and myself, (version tres) and;  Bruce, Roland, James Arwood, Ric Milhorn and myself, (the Return of the Bride of the Son of Final Curtain)   I hope I did not leave anyone out. It would be nice in retrospect to say we were a conceptual art group that encouraged "happenings" and "pushed the envelope" of publicly acceptable discourse and satire.... but actually we just wanted to get drunk and act like rock stars (much like the Ramones, another very good band.)

      Nice Claudia memory. Since everyone wore black back then, it's refreshing to imagine her with some additional color. I bet she'll always remember you. Who were the members of Final Curtain?

      Final Curtain went thru 3 bass players; John Smith, Jeff Campbell, and Ric Milhorn.   Jeff left Johnson City and pursued Keroac's dream by driving an 18 wheeler around the country. He was an enthusist of the work of sci fi author Harlan Ellison and once told me that he had met Mr. Ellison, as I recall at a Sci Fi convention. He existence was last confirmed by Rob Bacon, who was a singer in a poser band I don't remember the name of, and I last saw Robbie as the bailiff in the court I worked led him off to jail.  Ric went on to be a very well respected drug and alcohol rehab counseler, and now lives in the land of cheese. Prior to leaving J.C., he was also involved as the Tennessee Investigator for M.U.F.O.N., the "Mutual UFO Network."  Now John claims a UFO experience......COINCIDENCE?????????

      Good Lord has this blog become a snoozefest!!  Taoism?  Christian realism? (Isn't that an oxymoron?)  Since when did this become a theological forum?  Time for old SPAM to jump out of his can and declare "Fuck that shit...PABST BLUE RIBBON!!" We dont want philosphical debate, we want DIRT!  And Uncle Spam can dish it, oh yees. So, without further ado, lets kick start this bitch!  I remember Claudia!  And I have a Claudia story!  And its good!  Would I lie? It seems that one fine spring afternoon in 19XX, myself and one Christopher (Ugly Ugly) Slaughter were driving around town in search of some new kind of kick, when, through circumstances too involved (not to mention embarrassing) to go into here, I had my right arm ripped open to the bone by a piece of safety glass.  Geez, it hurt!  (I still have the scar.)  So Chris is driving me to the emergency room (kind of him, no?) and I'm holding a towel to my arm, trying in vain (pun only partially intended) to stem the bleeding, and all the while he's yelling at me not to bleed on his car.  We stop at a red light (at the train tracks where Tennessee St. meets State of Franklin Rd. if you care) when a car pulls up behind us and a young lady gets out.  It's Claudia!  Seems her and some of her Milligan cronies were putting on a production of "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You" and she was portraying the titular role.  (Catholic bashing:  Always in style...and thats a SHOOT, brutha!)  So to make a long story short (who said "Too late?")  Claudia does one of those "stop at a red light and run over to your friends car" kind of things to ask us to come to the show.  "Well, we kind of had an accident." Chris informed her.  "Oh, are you alright?" she asked, obviously concerned with Chris (He's a rock star, y'know) and only marginally aware of my presence.  This was about to change.  Chris's reply was something like, "Sure, I'm fine.  But my friend here got banged up a bit." and with that, I held my arm out the window, sending great splashes of bright red arterial blood flying over Claudias face and body.  She made a noise like a deer caught in a hunters trap, and then Chris and I sped away.  My last sight of her was standing in the middle of the road covered in my blood, looking for all the world like Sissy Spacek in the prom night scene from "Carrie".  Only standing in traffic. Yep.  Good times.

      Doug: would be interested in hearing your experiences. I think I saw a UFO once, but I don't know, so maybe I didn't. When I tell people about it, they say I must've been hallucinating. It flew over my car, in Cherokee Hills, J.C. Couldn't have been a plane---was only a ball of light, gold, not white like a comet or star either. Just a circular, gold ball that flew fast across the sky, as high as a plane, but not as high as a star. I don't know what I saw. The whole concept is creepy to me, but also believable. My boyfriend, Tom, sometimes thinks he's been abducted. Sometimes I think we both have. You gotta' wonder. It's either the biggest hoax on earth, or an incredibly large truth and conspiracy that radically changes people, sort of like Jesus. I just like the idea of distinct lines between good and evil, and when things get confusing, I want safety.

      Brook: Keith Fields would be able to explain them better. One of them involved camping on Buffalo Mtn. and seeing a UFO, then also, he said, he and his friends heard scratching on the outside walls of their tent, followed by "someone" or "something" picking up the whole tent, shaking it, and putting it down. He has another story about being at home and papers on his desk blowing around the room when there were no windows or doors open. And his dog went crazy, barking. He told me others too which, not surprisingly, I've forgotten. What, exactly, would his having had a UFO encounter explain for you? Why such curiosity? By the way, Bill informed me that Warren Zevon has terminal, inoperable cancer. I'm not exactly a Warren Zevon fan---but sad story.

      Bill: you may be right about more prudes than four. I think this other woman named Claudia (name just came to me right this second---weird) was also in that group. I have no idea who played the bongos.   (I know Brook doesn't censor. I'm at work though and don't want anyone here to see what terrible language I'm prone to using.)  FYI: Speaking of degrees of separation--and thanks, Brook, for turning me on to that film (six degrees of...)---found out today that a certain state lawmaker who supports a lottery amendment (Cohen) is also good friends with Warren Zevon.

      Bill: Have never been to Cimmeron, N.M. Sounds spicey----like a transformational experience.   Spam: Am curious what a mayonnaise farm looks like.    Bill: Members of the "F****ing Prudes" are: Sarah Cummins (who now lives in Knoxville, is married to a Botany professor, and has 3 kids---we were good friends "back in the day" but I haven't seen her in five or so years); Tracy Cosgrove (now Tracie Fields, whose husband, Keith, has had some extremely wild extra-terrestrial encounters, I kid you not, that give me the creeps to think about); Angie Street (now living in Atlanta, I think), and Kathy Hubbard (also living in Atlanta, but Ditty may know more about that.) For all I know, Reinhold Neibuhr was a member of the Helion Shoe Shine Riders. One would hope a good Christian would also know how to properly “shake it”....  Maybe he could be compared to Jessco White, the Dancing Outlaw.  Lisa: Sounds like you know more about Reinhold Neibuhr than I do at this point! He was definitely a “Christian realist”, nearly an existentialist similar to Kierkegaard. I also read stuff by his brother, Richard, who was similar in terms of his concern about juxtaposing what is spiritual with what is “cultural/real”.  When I was 18, my soccer playing boyfriend at the time gave me a book by him as a gift--I guess he thought I’d like to do some additional heavy reading outside of class. Funny now to think of all that stuff---being 18, dating a soccer player, and getting into Christian existentialist thought.   I think one of the eternal great mysteries of the ‘80’s in J.C. is Bleu Jackson. I wonder if he still wears those berets? I never knew if the “funky” spelling of his name simply reflected his fondness for a particular salad dressing, or his penchant for all things French. A Parisien (notice the ‘e’) bluesman......hmm....He and my brother graduated high school together and were good friends....they love to tell me this story about having some kind of fake vomit they would throw on the floor so they could get out of class. How true that was, I don’t know. Did the toy industry make fake vomit in the mid-60’s? If so, how did it shape the cultural landscape? Now there’s a theological question.

      Hmmmmmmmm, well We were in Jeff Gold's Mysticism class with a bunch of hippies, who for some reason thought I was an irritating smartass (I know, it's had to imagine where they might have gotten that idea!) One day while Jeff was going over the concept of detachment as it related to Taoism, he asked if anyone had a western example. After a pregnant silence, with hippies stareing into space, I said "Shane", referring to the western movie. The hippies erupted with their usual wrath, when Donnie, and others, jumped to my defense, pointing out that the storyline of "Shane" did meet the criteria. Perhaps I was wrong on you being there, or which side you took!!  As I recall I needed the class as an elective for my major, while most of the rest of us were there because we thought it might involve Voodoo.

      Speaking of Bleu Jackson. When I played bass in his band, I remember we played Jonesboro days. Dan Hinton on guitar, Phil Leonard on drums, Brian DuBoise on harp, Bleu and me. The next day we met at QB's to split the take. It was $200 or $250 or something like that-- not chump change for someone who worked at the Firehouse BBQ like myself. Anyway, the whole band is sitting there splitting a pitcher when Bleu shows up. "Guys, I got paid but I rode my motorcycle home-- and the check must have blown out of my pocket". Don't know if he was lying or not -- all I know is I never saw a dime. Such was life as a white-boy blues man.

      I just tripped over some Reinhold Neibuhr recently- a "neo-orthodox" or "Christian realist" theologian, his is a complicated story. He was a liberal protestant during the Progressive era, then became an isolationist after WWI. Then he did this "Christian realist" thing because communism had failed and the nazis were evil, so a "realistic Christian" had only the choice of the lesser of evils. His pessimism was an influence on John Dos Passos, mark 2, and James Gould Cozzens, expounding on maturity as the ability to live in an imperfect, ironic world...but it can be read as an apology for apathy, too. Is my source on the mark, Julie?

      Could that show be the one where Blue knocked over my congas at the Down Home?? yeah, Mike and I were doing a Bros. Ugh show & he knocked it over when we were loading it up and it rolled down the hill. I could a killed 'em, but hey, I am sure he doesn't remember it. Spam, You easily entertained one, Rob and I are debating your secret identity. Elvis rules! Hey Bloggers, EME is going to be on Studio One program LIVE  on public radio@ 1:00 on Sat. Oct. 12. Check us out. We won't be doing" Elvis"but here's a chance to tune in.

      I won't get around to getting Blue Jackson kicked out of Chucky Trading Company until I first report how we embezzeled 3 weeks of rehersal time at the Community Theatre, ignored the NO ALCOHOL AT THE THEATER rule, spent more time coming up with a name than in writing our entire first set, managed to get 7 people on stage at the Down Home (including a bass player dressed for some reason as a gangster), made it snow inside the Down Home, made a huge pile of money for Phil Leonard, and got ourselves kicked out of Down Home. Then, and only then, can we explain how we, with the assistence of the DCI, got Blue Jackson kicked out of Chucky Trading Company. After that we can move on to getting ourselves kicked out of Chucky, returning to Down Home, getting kicked out again, and all of that will be easier than explaining how we got kicked out of Down Home on a night we were not playing, and most of us were not even there....  Julie: I don't know if I've met you or not. But any friend of Brook's..... say, have you ever been to Cimmeron, New Mexico????  The Former First Dog should be named "Enronworldcomdesertercowardcokeheaddrunkardlyingpretzelchokeabortioncauserconstituionignoringshadowgovernmentwhineyass- secondplaceinfloridaunlessmybrotherdoesthecountfuckface", but we could just call him "Kenny Boy"  Remeber in 2004, Re Elect Gore!  by the way, I would be interested in hearing stories of how other bands came up with names, or actually more interesting to me would be a list of names rejected on the way. We have some dandies, which I hope to share soon. Perhaps Spam could help me with this....  And finally I need to write sometime about how the movie "Shane" became a metaphor for Taoist detachment and why I owe a big thanks to Brook, Donnie, Heather and John for coming to my defense on that occasion.....

      Julie: I should SAY your etiquette is bad.  How DARE you interrupt our Smirnoff-and-seconal soaked rantings with your coherent narrative, intelligence, and obvious insight.  For shame!  Quick, grab a bong and turn on Springer before its too late!! There may yet be hope.     Brook, there were eight issues of PST. I cant believe you've saved so many...I only have three.(Nos. 2, 4, and 7) I've since been informed that "P.K. Eckleberg" is actually the name of a character from "The Great Gatsby".  I do not actually know if this is true, since as you may know I NEVER LEARNED TO READ! (Sobs uncontrollably)     Snf.  "Macbett" is a play by surrealist/dadaist/whateverist Eugene ("Rhinocerous") Ionesco.  It is supposed to be an absurdist version of "Macbeth". The thing utterly tanked. I'm not sure if the blame falls upon the script or the production, but the final result was so incredibly fucking tooth-gnashingly horrible that its kinda difficult to care.       Bill!  You're killing me!  First you steal my Heather story, then you become the official FINAL CURTAIN historian. (Oooh ooh tell 'em about how we got Bleu Jackson and Co. kicked the hell out of Chucky Trading Company!  Arguably our finest hour.).     Doug:  Okay, you GOTTA play it now!! And you gotta have the spring-loaded Elvii inside the styrofoam pyramids.  Hahahahahaha!  I love it!  I am easily entertained!     John Smith is God.  Its true its true.     So I hear on NPR Bill Clinton has a new dog, and he's turned to us, the  great unwashed masses, to help him think of a name!  I would like to officially suggest "Spot"...HAW!... And thats the chime telling me its time for morning meds.  Ciao, my little peppermint candy children.

      Bill: I can't remember (the memory problem again) who all was in the Fucking Prudes. One of them,  I believe, was Kathy Hubbard. I'm not even sure of her last name. I'll have to ask Debby Patten---who links me to my memory of that time period on a regular basis. We have considered getting all the Milligan crowd together again for a reunion,  and I believe those guys would be involved. As to your comment about Christianity, thanks for the response, and I agree. And your name is very familiar  to me. I'm sure I've met you, just don't remember how/when. I'm sorry.

      Julie: I don't think Tinglehoff gave all Christians a bad name. I consider myself of the Christian faith, and he had no effect on me what-so-ever (though arguably I have given myself a bad name from the christian perspective.) Foaming at the mouth charismatic/fundementalists are as representative of Christianity as Shite fundementalists are to Islam, or as Rush Limbaugh is to rational thought.  As to The Fucking Prudes, I thought they were the most amazingly cool thing I had ever seen, and would pay good money to see a reunion show.

       I just read a lot of the back entries to this site, which I hadn’t really done, so I didn’t know some of you had written. Looks like I just plopped myself right down in the middle of stuff without really considering the etiquette of it all. My apologies.  It is strange for me to write about my own knowledge and experiences in the eighties because my memory is really horrible. I catch glimpses of things, but little of it really connects, which is the case for much of the past for me. I attended college in Chicago, where I had an entirely different set of experiences, then I would travel home and enter into the J.C. scene at very random times and places. The college I went to, Wheaton, was/is a Christian college, and students weren’t allowed to do the following: dance, drink, smoke, or have sex with anyone of either gender at any time other than within the context of marriage. At the same time, it was a highly academic, liberal arts environment. It wasn’t Bob Jones, in other words. So--I’d go up north and study theologians like Carl Barth and Reinhold Neibhur, and study constantly, then come down to Johnson City and find myself engaging in all manner of sin. Obviously, it was a confusing time for me. I have my regrets. In many ways, I was intimidated by the whole J.C. scene. It expanded my mind at the time though, and in retrospect now, I’m glad it did. All of you have got to be the most intelligent, creative, unique bunch I’ve ever had the privilege of knowing.  Another note - for the Milligan students who went to Nightmare’s shows, there was this heightened sense of----this is SO WILD. We probably consumed more alcohol than anyone else--staying true to the stereotype that, when Christians screw up, they do it larger than everyone else and without forethought. Does anyone remember the Fucking Prudes? All Milligan students.    When Dialogue was going on, which I do remember, I was mainly in Chicago. During Iran/Contra, a lot of Wheaton students, myself included, were active at a south american cafe/store in the city called The Heartland. All contributions went to support the Sandinistas. I remember the Acid Cows, John. “Is there life after death or are there beaches in Arkansas?” I once knew all the lyrics.  Well, that’s it from here. I think I’ve offered about all that’s really reasonable for me personally. I wish all of you the very best---always.

      Re: The Nightmare's Last Show at the Down Home - the first "last show" I mean... If Kurt hasn't ripped it off from me, I still have a tape of it that Phil gave me.  I also have tapes from the first Nightmare show at the Down Home.  And the New Year's Eve show when Mark Ryalls sang "I want to rock and roll all night" at midnight.  Phil even added echo effects to the last word of each verse Mark sang.  Drove me "craaaazy!"  Brooke, I have a buncha PSTs too - I'm not sure (I'll have to look) but I may even have #1.

      The lost posting of Bill from a week ago (that got me scolded for being on AOL) went into the Grease band history. George Mactee (later of MacBett) ran into me in the fall of 1984. He was of the understanding that I was a mature young man that could be trusted to get a band together for his production of Grease (he was not the last director to intrust me with a position of responsibility in a play...see Chris's earlier comments re: Dracula.) I barely knew anything about playing the guitar, but knew someone who did. Frank Spangler agreed to help, but only on the condition that he enlist some guys from Andy Boy/Acid Cows; John (God) Smith and Donnie Poole. This was then the make up of "Five Neat Guys." The play was generally panned (this was when the J.C. and Kingsport papers reviewed plays) but the band was reviewed well, one reviewer even called us "the all too good rock and roll band." This would become the core that would become Final Curtain, and start the downward descent of East Tennessee culture in general......  more later!!  John, I'm still waiting on a copy of the John Smith is God Newsletter!!!!

      Not all andy boy... just parts of andy boy. I think the lineup was Frank, Roland, Bill and me but I could be mistaken. This is the band that went on to form the core of Final Curtain. Even some of the Final Curtain songs were stolen from Grease songs. There was some song about governent cheese(not the band) that was a grease tune.

      So far, Bill gets my vote for best Heather encounter!     My first encounter was when she strolled up to our tables and loudly announced over the music: "You know Tony, you're really loud!"  "Well thanks, Heather!"  I said over the music, in basically my normal voice. She scrunched her face for a second, then said, "Wait!  That wasn't a complement!" I replied with a big smile:  "I know!" She shook her hair slightly, looked at me the way exasperated mothers look at their mud-soaked four year old, and walked away.  She was soooo cute.  Hiya, John.  I miss the skiffle period.    It did seem, for awhile, that every time I saw a band you were in it.  I thought it was just weird deja-vu.  Was Andy Boy the stage band for Grease?  That's reaching-back into the fringes for me.  It seems like Greese was some-kind of catalyst to the music around here.  Any validity to my little hypothesis? (he said arching his eyebrow and pulling at his stubbly chin).  So, Doug.  What would you take for that ten pound bag of religious pamphlets?

      Don't mean to interrupt a conversation, but just want to say, in regard to Marty Tinglehoff, it's highly unfortunate, but usually is the case, that those who most mis-represent and bring defamation upon a belief system, institution, way of life, are those who receive the most attention and publicity. Sometimes I wonder what that says about us--the human race. Sorry if this type is really large--can't find a way to change it.

      Strange to say, but.....I can't remember old "whats her names" name.  So I wont say until I am sure.    OOOOOHHHHHH GOD!  Marty Tinglehoff.  I once attended one of his anti-rock propiganda/brain wash fests at that "charismatic" church on the Kingsport highway.  He first greeted all of us "rockers" as a "friend" and told me he didn't mind if I was wearing a Judas Priest t-shirt.  However, about mid cermon (an hour in) he's ranting at the top of his voice, in real fire and brimstone form, and says "and you have the gaaaaaauuuullllla to wear thear t-shirt into this house of worship!"  A real class act he was.  Heard he was caught imbezeling from the church some time ago.  HHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!  Elvis In The Pyramid was great.  EME always made me laugh.  Wow Doug, I'd love to see some of the old flier.  They are a great reflection of the bands and the times.  Some were flashy with a lot of thought, while others were cranked out in five minutes.  They seemed to go through stylized phases too.  I also agree with Doug on the Weekly Beat.  It was a good area mag.

      Yes there was a MacBett. In the program to it, I was thanked for quitting it. George Mactee directed it, and Roland Tester was in it. I don't recall anyone else.... so while it may have been the drugs, they were not halluciniginic (which are known to cause poor spelling.) It starred a guy named Scott Snell, who was a regular at the Community Theatre at the time, and may still be.   I have been meaning to mention the first time I remember meeting Heather, although I may have met her before then, was at the first Final Curtain show at the Down Home. We had spent a total of 5 minutes writing a song called "Tinglehoff Blues" which was about Kingsport's own Anti-Rock and Roll Preacher, Marty Tinglehoff. Although quickly written (it consisted of and E chord followed by and A chord, repeat until bored) it took about 45 minutes to preform, as it's lyrics were a free form rant by Bruce (and we all know how good he is at that.) Anyway, about 15 minutes into the song I was bored and walked off the stage to get a beer. We had about 3 guitarists, so the abscence of one was rarely noticed. About the time I got tired of mingling with the audience and went back to the stage, Heather took the Mic from Bruce and started chanting:"The Devil's in my uterus...He's yours Marty! He's yours!!"

      question -- how many issues of PST were there? I have numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and half of a cover-less one with 63 Eyes and Freak Circus interviews. I am totally loving the letter from Dr. Eckleburg and bruce's response ("i hate to censor anyone, even a psuedo-intellectual maggot such as yourself... ")!   another question -- was it the drugs, or did I attend a production of a take-off on Macbeth called MacBett at the johnson city community theater featuring some of you theater-types. was it good?

It always got the crowd going and I have to construct some more of those "pyramid" props we had at the Venus show where we trashed the place  with broken styrofoam. That was the show we gave out potted meat products, condoms and a 10 Lb  bag of religious pamphlets. Besides your PST, I thought the weekly Beat was great too.

      Tony, you are right about the computing power. Hell, probably not enough to compute the number of bands I was in - Bass player is synomous with music whore me thinks. I have considered creating a database to do just that. Sort of the six degrees of separation kind of thing. I know I’m one degree removed from Johnny Carson having played with the old tonight show band drummer Ed Shaughnessy. Check this shit out   http://www.drummerworld.com/drummers/Ed%20Shaugnessy.html  How about those burns!  What about the fact that we are all once removed from GG Allen via Johnny Puke? Now that’s fucking scary!  On the JC thing: Having played in all sorts of shit-hole college towns, I must say that JC was/is unique. Not that there were not other towns with good scenes but that JC had one. People were so crazy for music. I knew tons of people back then who looked forward to playing JC just for the crowd response.

      Feathers seem to ruffle easily in here.  Anyway...  Not all that long ago in a galaxy right on top of us,  we gathered at the round table during yet another happy hour.  There was much joking and goofing and wondering who would be first to spit beer out their nose.  Somehow the talk got onto 'the sensitive guy' of the eighties.  Bill expanded on this theme by coining the acronym SNAG (Sensitive New-Age Guy), which really sent our tiny male kill-or-be-killed brains into fight or flight mode.  Finally, in an attempt to learn by example, we asked the ladies to just point out  the most sensitive guy in the pub.  To a woman they all named Franky!  You can imagine the difficulty our how-can-I-get-laid/are-you-going-to-eat-that brains were having comprehending this.  Just as a control in this little experiment, we polled the rest of the women in the pub, making a total sample of about nine or ten, including those at our table.  ALL chose Franky.  The next day it was made official when the owner put this phrase on the Quarterback's marquis: HOME OF MR. SENSITIVE.     Doug: Psychic Sex Turnip.

      Holy bat-gerbil!  The way you guys have been talking about PST you'd think someone actually read it or something.  Why couldn't you guys have gotten so interested then, instead of just thumbing through and looking for your names.    From the Horses Mouth: TCoker:  I NEVER made any money from PST.  It was just a happy coincidence that stemmed from the fact my girlfriend at the time's best friends Dad (take notes, there will be a quiz afterward) ran a print shop, and was willing to print the damn thing for free.  Meanwhile, I found myself living next door to fine graphic artist in the form of Christopher Slaughter (Hi Ugly!) who was only too happy to let me exploit---that is, use his fine work in my publication.  I also cannot credit Johnny Puke enough.  Yes, he was an asshole  (Man Howdy!!)  but who knew he was also one hell of a writer?  Check out his interview with the Bar-B-Que killers where he and the band get kicked out of the club theyre playing for smoking pot.  (One of the band members just kept pacing and repeating "Man, our shits in there!" It's priceless!)  His interviews, reviews, and general do-it-yourself attitude were instrumental.    Bill:  You might wanna check the dosage on that Paxil scrip, bro...I quit doing the zine because the girl at the print store got wise and decided to start CHARGING me (shudder). To all you whippersnappers out there this was way before the age of desktop insta-publishing, and printing cost beaucoup bucks.  Since lots of people wanted to READ the zine but no one actually wanted to PAY for it...I would have kept it up as long as it could pay for itself.  No offshore banking.  Not that I wouldn't have spent the money if I could have made it.    UglyUgly:  Actually my exact words were "childish" and "embarrassing"  in reaction to your and Pukes little dog and pony show.  I also distinctly remember telling Johnny "...man you are so full of shit its a wonder you dont squeak when you walk."  I dont know  what that means, but I really havent seen or heard anything since to disprove it.   Good luck with the blog!  Doing something like this is pretty thankless work, so respect to all of youse guys.  I was there!  I know names!  I seen it all!  I swear I'm not drunk!!

      No Bill, I'm not saying that.  Bruce said that.  Doug: I concur.  The Stinky Finger 'joke' (as it began) was hysterical, unique and entertaining.  But I was glad too see them team up with guys like you in EME (among others) who helped them round out their performances.  They were just too creative and talented to stay in joke-mode forever.     Here's another "Dracula" story.  As Bill pointed out, the final scene was played in the dining room amongst the audience.  On our last show, myself (as Dr. Seward), Bruce (as young Jonathan Harker), and an actor who's name I can't remember  (as Dr. Van Helsing) had made our way through the catacombs (which was the kitchen) and were standing at the coffin of the hideous creature (Franky) as it lay surrounded by  a bunch of overdressed, slightly lit senior citizens.  In the hushed silence I deliver my line: "Harker, hand me the hammer and stake."  Harker: "I thought you brought the hammer and stake.  Wait here, I'll go get it!"  So Van Helsing and I were left to ad-lib while Bruce raced back through the kitchen, rattling some pots and pans, and started tearing the prop room apart looking for the huge wooden mallet and sharpened stake.  What we didn't know was that the props couldn't be found and he and Bill were desperately trying to come up with a substitute.   I was about ready to begin clearing tables when Bruce finally showed up with the new props, and for the first time in history Dracula was destroyed with a broken pool cue and a ball-peen hammer.

      So Coker,,,, what you are saying is that Bruce did not stop PST because it wasn't making money, only that it wasn't making enough money to pay for it's own printing once access to free printing disappeared. In other words, it was not profitable. Like you, I admired Bruce for his love of the J.C, scene and his dedication to it's nurturing via PST. I thought it was great and looked forward to it's publication each whenever, and like you I contributed articles to it. I agree that Bruce never wrote it for the money,,, it was always a chore to pry 50 cents from a college student at a bar on quarter beer night when he was selling it.......In addition Bruce paid his dues the first time Final Curtain played at "The Village of Pub Venus Out Back" We were the first band to play there that did not write it's set list by alternating Lynard Skynard and Molly Hatchet covers ("so it don't get  boring.") We were warmly recieved by rednecks that occupied the place, who lauded the arrival of the Alt./punk scene by throwing glass ashtrays, as well as a half pitcher of beer at us. Their applause included comments on our music, family lineage, and our house pets as I recall. Quite the scarey evening. Final Curtain at the time was Bruce, John Smith, Roland Tester, Myself, and Wayne Winkler of all people making his only appearence with us. I think Frank was there too, but I don't remember if he was still in the band. There was a table of construction workers there that had a couple of black guys at it with 3 or 4 of the biggest white guys I had ever seen and our show brought a great feeling of racial harmony to the room as they put aside thier differences long enough to all hate us. This was, and remains, the worst show we ever did, and my personal least favorite.

      I'm not sure I get the Bush/Enron/PST connection, but I do know what Bruce told me.  He never made more than pocket change from the magazine, he was putting it out because he enjoyed it.  He was good at it, too.  It became a community publication, with all kinds of people contributing material.    Speaking of Bruce, he is one of the few people I remember meeting, mostly because of the circumstances.  A bunch of us were packed into a huge 70s era Chevy looking to crash a formal dinner being hosted by the ETSU music department.  There was this kid, and I mean kid, getting us all stoned.  I asked his name and when Lisa Dockery heard it she cries out "Your Bruce Honeycutt!"  Turns out she used to baby-sit him.  She was really tickled by the whole thing.  We crashed the party, got chased around by a bald guy in a tux, and ended up hiding in a tiny men's room.  Ah, glory days.

      Oops, silly me, I keep trying to subtract expenses from revenue to determine wheather an enterprize is profitable. Who would have dreamed that printing costs could be considered an expense. Perhaps Bruce should have spun off "PST Printing" as an off shore company in order to hide this cost of running a paper. By using the Harken Oil accounting system, PST could still be publishing. This Enron style accounting the conservatives extoll sure is handy!!!! No wonder the economy is doing so well under George Bush's visionary leadership!!!!!   Dyslexics of the World Untie!!!

      D.Hilliard:  Sorry dude.  Stinky was never 'given a start' by any band; they were born at an 'Open-Hoot'.  They were horrific, they were vulgar, they were unforgetable.  With each lyric they passed a two-headed dildo back and forth like a baton in a perverted relay race.  The PACKED house hooted, howled and became part of the show.  That is a rarity in any part of the country.  Middle Earth is cool, but Johnny and Chris were self-starters.

      Well Alan...Surfboard was written by Kurt for the Nightmares and they played it for quite a while.  We picked it up as a laugh, to poke some fun at the Nightmares (with Kurts blessing) and made it something else.  What's Her name....We did a song by that name in Buck Fifty and the Longnecks, is that what you're thinking of? Tony:  Yes...JCs "scene" history isn't any different than any other town.  However, it is ours.  The difference would be a historical documentation of the people and events.  Christy's documentary shows the story of one town and one band.  The overall appeal is that people in many many towns could watch it and see thear town/bands/friend/scene in the film.  Besides, it's fun.  So blog to your hearts content.

      Who the hell are you people?  I've lived in JC since 1981 and have never heard of any of you!  Except for those Burt/Sam guys that Edwards keeps talking about.  I actually had a class with them at ETSU, but back then they called themselves Say-id.  It was a theater class!  Those guys were thirty if they were a day!  Why in the hell are thirty-year-old Iranian/Jordanian/Turk/Saudis taking a theatre class?  My ass.  Edwards:  Bruce didn't quit the mag because it wasn't profitable.  He quit because he lost access to a free printing company via his girlfriend's best friend.  Once the friend became, shall we say 'disenchanted' with Bruce she cut him off.  A kind of six-degrees-of-mooching gone wrong. After that he folded like a cheap umbrella in a monsoon. Too bad.  Hey.  John Smith guy.  There isn't enough computing power at NOAA to resolve the intricate musician/band relationships spanning the period 1982 - 1994.  Hell, I was Stinky Finger's manager for three years and didn't  even know it!  E.Williams: Tell our stories before we get senile?  If I get any more senile I'll be wetting my pants and calling the landlord "mommy".  I can't agree that one needs to travel back in time to find a JC-like 'fringe' society.  That scene was great, but hardly unique.  I moved here from Athens, GA.  In spite of the size of UGA, Athens was a small town, every bit as small as Johnson City still is.  I saw the B-52s at the 'Hole In The Wall' just at the edge of downtown  Athens (think 'Highlander' re:JC).  They played in the basement of a space-for-rent building; no windows and a single glass door with the name stenciled on it.  Most of the cool small towns I have ever visited/lived-in had one thing in common: a university.   I think the combination of small town/university is a kind of oasis where misfits gather to bathe in the waters.  Some are enlivened.  Some drown.  It sure beats hell out of the surrounding desert.  Anybody wanna make odds on D.Poole (a computing guru) actually getting involved in this?  How about Christy?  She could probably raise an eyebrow or two.  Infidels unite!

      Ok, so earlier tonight I wrote a comprehensive history of Final Curtain from the summer of 1979 thru the fall of 1984. It was entertaining and included the phrases "I hold Greg responsible" and "My Sister's Had Two Operations." Then when I hit enter to post it, my Mac decided to log me off AOL, and it was forever lost.....  When I get a chance I'll write it again...  Until then, be excellent to one another.

      This weekend I was just remembering meeting Lynne Youngquist for the first time, in the bathroom at the Down Home of course. We were talking about the fact that she is of Swedish descent. She said the only Swedish phrase she knew was "Tvec! Tvec! Der sprechen der thoime! (sp?)", which, when translated, means "Take it away! Take it away! It's as big as a thermos!" I still laugh uncontrollably when I think of that.

      Hello bloggers, ahhh, the 80's. I thought Quarterbacks,the Pub Outback were my favorite places to play and of course Down Home, where sooooo many of us got our starts. Hi, I am Doug from ELECTRIC MIDDLE EARTH, anybody out there remember us?  Well, we are still kicking and playing at BUCK'S PIZZA on Tues.Sept.10th @ 10-1 and VITO's  Sept.Fri. the 13th. I remember playing shows with Floyd Eats Mayberry,also Beat Your MOther with a Putrid Herring. Here is a little known fact for ya... FYI..We were the first band to give STiNKY fINGER their start. In fact, we backed them up at a show where they opened for us at Pub Outback.  This was when it was Ugly,ugly and jOhnny Puke era. We were doing or psyhedelic stuff , very cool show. WE still do some of our old 80's standards plus lots of new music. Come out and see us. We would love to see you there.!

      When the Nightmare's first got together, I was dating Kurt---sort of. We were at Ditty's house on Highland Ave., listening to Fables of the Reconstruction one day. I was probably preaching some sermon about how U2 was going to save the world, when the phone rang.  It was some McDonald's representative asking Kurt if his band would play for the grand opening of the campus McD's. He said sure, hung up, and said, I just told them my band would play for this thing, and I don't have a band....well, there's this guy, Brian, who maybe could sing....I went to that first show. I remember watching a couple of little kids, toddlers, dance religiously on top of these milk crates. And I thought, do other towns celebrate with such zest the coming of a new McDonalds?

      Freaky that I can work at a newspaper on a completely new computer system and still have trouble with the most basic of processes. Like using this damned publishing tool. And it seems just when I have something ready to go, I get interrupted by work. Referencing Lisa's description of Heather Berry from days and days ago---here is my description of when I first met her.  My connection to the whole "Nightmares" scene was through many different paths---knowing Donnie and John since third grade (Kurt too), and Martin since tenth grade. Then also through my connections with Milligan College--when I went to school there for a semester and would go to Nightmare's shows with that crowd. Hope everyone had a good holiday.     The first time I met Heather Berry, we were both 17. Young. I worked in the guidance counselor’s office during my free period, and it was the first day of school at University High. Heather came into the office wearing her usual attire--long black skirt; hair comparably long and blue-black. She seemed acutely aware of her lips, covered with her staple ruby red lipstick, as she sat facing Mrs. Tiffany, answering questions and filling out paperwork. I was sitting to her right, knees to my chest, on a vinyl, cushioned green office chair, pretending to read but really glancing up from my book, staring at her, listening to the sound of her voice, dreamy. Through some purely subconscious adolescent process that I can only describe as skeletal, or muscular, visceral, I understood my own unquestioning obedience to rules. Heather made me extremely curious. Until that moment, I had never considered the possibility that I hadn’t yet lived.

      FUCK the Fucking Prudes. I mean that in the best way possible.   As long as we are talking about bands with girls in them, anyone remember... Tall Tale? Or that very short-lived ensemble featuring Liz Turbull? Lilliput Langstrum or something equally impossible to remember (it was a Willy Wonka reference, no?). They did a cover of a GnR song which won my eternal approval. Liz was surprisingly good -- and not just in that way that you say someone is good at something that you don't expect them to do (like if Dick Cheney took up pet portraiture) -- but in the way of measuring up to anyone else. They were really good.   Here's something....  Watching the Sopranos last week I was reminded of my all-time favorite John Smith story. There was a yarn in the episode where AJ (the Soprano son) goes to his super-rich girlfriend's house and he and his friend are marveling at the Picasso paintings and other priceless possessions when the friend pulls out a Rubber Soul record and says, "this must be worth a fortune!" I laughed to the point of snot because...  John used to have one of those Rubber Soul records in his collection. When we lived on the corner of Roan and Watauga we used his stereo to listen to records in the attic (birdpoop, shit howdy). He hated that. To know John is to know and love his streak of anal retentiveness. Given this trait, imagine how antsy he could get thinking people were messing around in his record collection and likely breaking things. Antsy he was, and not without reason. Donnie and I had previously fried his speakers goofing around, trying to scratch. Whoops.   So, it's one of the *first few times* John doses and he's shooing everyone away from the his turntable and record collection. Paranoid, maybe. But I was wanting to play Fear of a Black Planet for the bazillionth time and that required using his stereo and being in close proximity to his record collection. He was having none of it. He locked the stereo room, and the music situation was easily forgotten moments later.   The next thing we know, Public Enemy is blaring out of the speakers and John is coming up the stairs with a handful of black record shards. It was his Rubber Soul. In a moment of clarity, John made this meaningful (albeit weird) sacrifice (Jeff Gold would be proud).   And THAT was all the proof I needed to affirm my suspicion that drugs (along with exercise and eating right) make you a better person.

      I attempted to post this at work today...and thought that I could but it didn't work So now I'll give it a try at home (thanks anyway, Brook!)  HI Everyone! Okay, I’ve been lurking long enough and for some reason the publish button is actually showing up today (my Netscape at work usually doesn’t agree with the Blog). My memories are VERY VERY spotty- mostly due to 1986-1989. A while back I wanted to log on with a handfull of catty comments about the Fucking Prudes - decided that was just too expected and girl-ish of me. I also just HATE to be negative so I’ll say this about them- for a talentless group of tasteless wanna-bes they really weren’t Too terrible. Plus - I don’t think they really took their drinking seriously and I just could not respect that!  I remember the cock in sock night- Donnie Poole and I drove Kurt and John Hicks around. I remember we went to Rosalie and Sandra’s apt on Maple. I think that John or Kurt had a thing for Sandra because she seemed uptight and virginal. I don’t remember if we made any other stops. I do remember driving past Jay Sweeny’s Used Auto Lot and Kurt deciding that “Jay Sweeny” would be a new term for his stuff. As in “I’ve got my Jay Sweeny in a sock”   Now there's a phrase that really caught on!  I also barely remember the HRR. I do remember my ear being pierced. I think I remember early dawn hours and being in some sort of house with no window panes and some  farm animals hanging around. (looking IN the windows) As I write this I’m thinking I might be WAY off base. I think that I donated all of this terribly disgusting greasy ground beef. For some reason my parents had gone in with someone on a half a cow and it was low low low quality beef. It was so greasy that when you were finished patting out burgers your hands looked like they were dipped in vaseline.  This is all that is on my mind at the moment. I cannot be held accountable for any misinformation. I love reading everyone’s stories! More later!

      Spam and folks. We're you riding in the car when Hicks and I gave rosalie the cock sock treatment?  She was a really good sport about it.  I also had my first acid trip with Rosalie, when Brooke secretly but two hits in the pitcher of beer she and I were drinking at a Webb Wilder show.  Luckily Donnie was around to reorient me from time to time.

       $170,000 dollars in ten days.  I think that is a WETS record.   Best highlight - During one of our challenge hours a man calls in and offers a free massage to the highest pledger for the hour.  A young woman, who had volunteered to be on-air and talk about why she likes WETS, asked Wayne if this was a professional masseuse.  Wayne said, "Nah.  It's probably just some guy that hangs out at the bus station."  Man, we fell about the place.    After some discussion at Quarterback's the first Hindu rib roast was officially dubbed the Indo-Tibetan Rib Roast and Pool Party (thanks largely to Bill).  I seem to remember the first one as being larger than other's recall - I believe, all told, at least a hundred people were there if counted throughout the afternoon and night.  Someone actually showed up dressed in a sheet fashioned as some kind of toga, thinking it was a costume party.  He became a kind-of hero.  Does anyone remember who that was?  Over-all I have only vague memories spanning some three or four rib roasts:  Some guy leading several women armed with baseball bats, tennis rackets and various other bludgeoning instruments into the woods above The Farm on a snipe hunt.  Wait...   That was me.  And then there was the guy that got a bunch of us to pee on Doug and CC's tent early one morning, hollering about a monsoon.  Wait...   That was me.  And of course there was the time that guy threw a live chicken into Ralph and Vickie's tent while they were screwing.  Oh wait....    Let's get the Wade Jayney story straight.  We were desperate.  The keg had run out WAY too soon.  Wade, who didn't like me very much (even though he and I once teamed up to stop a giant black guy from killing Mary Beth with a flaming log [even though, at times, I felt like killing Mary Beth with a flaming log]) offered to buy a case of beer from the nearby VFW if he could push me into the pool.  Unfortunately I didn't notice it was the SHALLOW end of the pool and gashed my head.  Wade apologized later that night and I told him to forget it, it was an accident, and besides a deals a deal.  That party was the last place he was seen alive. He was killed the next morning in a bad drug deal.  As an epitaph I offered the following:  Wade Jaynee got shot, chopped up, stuffed in the back of an MG, set on fire and pushed off a cliff.   And all I got was this lousy T-shirt.    For those of you who don't think that's funny, I'll bet you Wade does.

      Once, back in the day, I was asked to help judge a battle-of-the-bands style competition at the Highlander.  Why I was asked I have no idea....possibly because of the Turnip folks thought I knew something about music.  Fools!  I remember the other judges being  Doug the sound guy, Todd the UNbelievably sleazy proprietor, and some guy from the Dusters.  No, I don't remember his name, but he was fat and I think he played bass.  The prize was 100$ and all the crank you could snort, or something...anyhow, the final vote came down to some unremembered (but actually pretty good) punkabilly group and, you guessed it, the Fucking Prudes.  We were split 50/50, Todd and I going for the prudes and Doug and fat blues dude going the other way.  Whilst I thought that the prudes were one of the most original things I had seen, the dissenting opinion was that they were nothing but a bunch of drunken college girls, and not really worthy of the "opportunity", while the other band had actual talent, and deserved the money.  Prudes, I fought for you all the way, but the tide turned against me, and now I'd be willing to bet NO ONE can remember the name of the other band...and this from the guy who said Stinky Finger would never be popular.  Maybe my magic 8-ball is on the fritz...  SPAMS QUICK HITS Elizabeth: Sorry, wrong......but LOL2002!!!!  Donnie Poole will NEVER return anything he borrows from you.  Ever.  Brian Relleva really is one heck of a nice guy.  Did Heather Barry EVER learn to walk properly in heels?  MEGAPLEZ ALL UP IN DA HIZZOUSE!!!  Dont know why, just felt like writing that. I hear he thinks I'm an asshole.  Moi, Scott?  Should I tell you about when Kurt Hagardorn and Johnny Hicks, after listening to WAAAY too much Red Hot Chili Peppers, showed upon Rosalies' doorstep wearing nothing but smiles and socks on their...my GOODNESS look at the time.  SPOON!

      turns out Bill was right that Seamus Heaney wrote a modernized version of Beowulf, though John Gardner did too. so----sorry Bill. and I know everyone else has just been torn to pieces over the modern Beowulf who-wrote-it question too, so I'm sure you'll all rest easier now.

Bikes everywhere.  As I remember I worked the show and everyone was very nice.  The Highlander brings back many memories.  The night Ted whipped up on those boys I used to go to school with was absolute insanity.  It's a long story so I'll only tell it if someone asks.  Wow....the Highlander...still have my t-shirt and many many stories.  Kurt.....so damn good to hear from ya bro.  Please blog on sir.

      Here's my scary UFO story (although that seems to have gone by the wayside).  At some point in 199x a group of UFO watcher's in Pensacola, FL had gained some national notoriety.  We decided it was necessary to track these people down so I with Roland Tester, Lana Goodwin, Rick Milhorn, Marsha Milhorn and Don Ellerson (Ellison?) rented a van and headed for the Gulf of Mexico.  We loaded out at Dogwood Heights Apartments where Lana was the live-in manager.  During the loading Lana handed me some kind of anti-bug lantern shaped like a hideous psychedelic mushroom.  It was like something from a Smurfs cartoon and I refused to have anything to do with it, which prompted Lana to burst into tears.  Finally loaded, we piled into the van and managed to settle her down as we headed out just after midnight on Friday morning.  Lana predicted she would probably be in the same condition coming back in.  The drive down was bright with stars, but as we pulled into the campground on a very nice Gulf inlet a light drizzle had set in.  No matter.  We went to a local shopping center and purchased a huge plastic cover-all that we hung from the trees as  a  giant lean-to.  We spent the next few days doing our best to have a good time while the weather grew steadily worse.  We also asked the locals if they knew anything of this UFO group, but it wasn't easy to find details.  As one weather beater we decided to go to a space, air and sea museum at Corey Naval Air Station where I attended Signal Intelligence school in the late 70's.  It wasn't until we were about fourth in line at the sentry gate that it occurred to us we were packing a cooler full of Bud, a half-once of pot, two body bags and a .38 revolver.  On top of this the driver, Rick, announced that he did not have his license with him.  And yes, they were checking.  As the sentry bent down to look at a license being held up from a small import, Rick & Marsha quickly switched seats without him noticing.  May have saved us a little embarrassment.  On our last day the weather let up just enough to spend some time on the beach.  No sun, but a lot less rain.  Late in the afternoon we noticed an oblong white object floating in from several hundred yards out.  It had the same shape as a refrigerator.   Roland thought it may be Cubans trying to immigrate.  He decided to swim out and welcome him/her/them to America.  The box was  also drifting down the beach as well as toward it.  Roland was constantly having to adjust to this and ultimately followed the box onto the beach.  The rest of us just walked to it.  It was a refrigerator, but there were no Cubans.  Later that afternoon we finally found someone who knew where the UFO watchers would be.  We were ecstatic.  That night we found the park (I forget the name) where they gathered.  It was a picnic park.  It was also directly across the bay from the Naval Air Station.  Duh.  What we discovered were mostly seniors (fifty+) stoking up on vodka tonics and seeing UFO's in every blinking light that flew across the bay.  They were watched over by a HUGE poodle dog.  I'm not kidding when I say the thing was three feet tall at the head.  It stood on top of a picnic table as though surveying its minions.  Somewhere around this time it all caught up to me: the rain, lack of sleep, the pot, the beer, the pint of whiskey I was drinking, the huge poodle dog, and I crashed in the van as some geezers were pointing into the air oo-ing and ah-ing at what was obviously a plane.  The next thing I recall is being back under our lean-to in a full blown gale.  I looked around and could see that everyone was trying to weather the storm as best they could.  There was a brilliant flash of lightning with a thunderclap that I could feel in my teeth.  Before the rumble died down Lana had popped out of her sleeping bag and was in the van in two great leaps.  I quickly followed, the wind and rain howling, and woke the next morning to the snoring of all the crew crammed into the van.  We showered, gathered everything in and were on the road late that morning just as the gale subsided.  We headed to the highway, pointing our van north, and I couldn't help but cry out "WE'RE ALIVE... ALI-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-VE!".  Not twenty minutes later we seemed to clear the doom and gloom.  The clouds parted and the drive home was full of blue sky and calm.  Not long after crossing the border into Georgia a large owl swooped down in front of the van, its great wings momentarily filling the windshield before it flew up and over.  At first we were enchanted, then someone brought up the linkage between owls and death.  In a south GA town we came upon an accident scene.  An old man had been hit by a car.  His head was slammed onto the curb.  There was blood all over.  Somewhere in middle GA we came across a train-car wreck.  Two large black women, who appeared to have just arrived, were wailing and crying out.  The car that was hit looked like an accordion.   In north GA Lana saw a sign pointing the way to Hank Williams' home and wanted to go there.  Roland offered an alternative plan: to see the giant chicken on top of a drive-thru chicken joint somewhere near Atlanta.  Of  course the chicken won out, which put Lana in a hurt mood.  Just as she predicted we arrived home with her crying and complaining, saying something about Tony [Black] treating her a lot better than all of us.

      Regarding the Toys for Tots show...you forgot the Marine, present in uniform, who was very vocal is his distaste for all the "long hairs" in the establishment.  Also, do you remember the older gentleman with the toboggan?  He would sit down at a table with his beer and shout  (at seemingly random intervals) "Tell 'em what Mary said!"  The broken beer bottles in the men's toilet was a lovely sight to behold.

      Plez here. I have gone back and read the last 50 posts to the J.C. blog. I hadn't thought about the Prudes in a long time. I wish they were still around. I remember one night when they sang at the Highlander, and Doug the sound man just kept bugging them by asking lurid questions from his soundboard mic. They sang "Iko Iko," I remember. No offense to anyone else, but they may have been the most legitimately sellable thing ever to come from this place.  Now that I've brought Doug's name up. I heard a rumor recently that he has on tape EVERY show from Highlander. That would include a couple of Southern Culture shows, the Georgia Satellites, and of course all of the local people.  No one has told this Highlander story. In December of 1988, they held one of those toys for tots benefit shows there. It was a very strange combination because first, you've got all the biker guys and their women. Then, add to that the fact that these Harley guys are walking in with Barbie dolls and what not to add to the donations. Then, because it was the Highlander, the acts were like, you know, us and our types, so there was a mix of the bikers and the regular crowd, too. As with all of these stories, it doesn't sound like much now that I write it down, but in my memory, that was a pretty strange event. Good strange, like the flavor of some Indian foods, though.  Ok, that's my post. Haven't done this in a while, don't know if I will soon, but I love the Blog, I really do. That message should be clear.

      Spam, that story is one of my favorite introduction tales. My favorite is when the future Mrs. Ric Milhorn met Frankie for the first time. Before he could say anything she looked him square in the eye and shouted "SHUT THE FUCK UP FRANKIE!!" Truer words are rarely ever spoken.

      Back in the day....as I pulled my 76 Ford Maverick (COMPLETE with 8-track player...who's yer daddy?) into its usual berth in front of everybodys favorite watering hole, QB's, who should I spy with my little bloodshot eye but my friend Franky, Mr. Sensitive himself, chatting up some young ladies in an adjacent car. He was leaning over their window wearing his fiercest "I am so cool... I am James Dean I am..." attitude.  (100 points and a cookie to anyone who can correctly identify that reference.)  With my usual grace and sophistication, I began to think to myself "Hot Damn!! Gurls!!"(Yes, I was quite contemplative in my youth.)  So I ask Frank to introduce me to his new friends. In his customary (not to mention patented) sensitive manner he replied "I dunno.  Some new girls from California or Florida or somewhere."  Intrigued by the prospect of out-of-town girls (who might as yet be uninformed of my general piglike manner and thus, dare I think it, actually DATE me), I leaned out my window to have a closer look.  I have an impresssion of one of the girls jumping from her passenger seat, most literally leapfrogging the hood of my vehicle, and all of a sudden there she was, this girl in a leopard-print bikini from California or Florida or the fucking moon for all I knew, right there, in my car! I was utterly speechless (an occurrence rare in the extreme). "Hi!" she bubbled, all impish smile and bobbing kewpie curls and cute little upturned nose. "I'm BROOK.  Do you have any POT?" Turns out I didn't.  My luck.

      Same here. My mom always loved the "straighter" looking guys I hung out with, who were always more deceptive and "unseemly" than my hippie-type friends. But I could never get her to see that. Weird. Seems like parents are so quick to assume that teenagers/young adults are totally illogical.

      julie's mom's harsh assessment of the rough and tumble young hagardorn reminds me of the first time the JC crew came to my house to pick me up during a college break. i think it was donnie, martin and john (memory hazy, maybe the blev), my uncle (and official parental gaurdian) took me aside to warn me about these unseemly characters. drug-dealers! neer-do-wells! for god sake they are wearing Black Leather Jackets! so funny b/c at that time, they were pretty much, what's the word... straight. strangely, maddeningly straight! whereas my kingsport buddies (decidedly more "collegiate" dressers) were true trouble-makers! he was so off the mark, but how do you say to your guardian that THESE guys are a-okay, it's everyone else you should have been worrying about. oh, i can't wait to be a parent one day!   james -- it gets worse every week. i'm going to have to start following a different sport. what's it gonna be? nascar? frisbee golf? long-distance yodeling?

      Kurt: I remember the eight-track stereo  in your car well. And you weren't the only man my mother has given the "fish eye" too. She is ruthless, uncompromising, in her "principles"---has always been. As I get older, I worry I'm becoming more like her. I told her not long ago what you do for a living now (aren't you a critical care nurse at Duke hospital?). Mom was a nurse for over 30 years, so she was very impressed with that info and made a comment about possibly misjudging you. In those days, she was suspicious about every move I made, and, at times, with good reason----not, however, concerning you :). Hope all is well.  I'll have to tune in to Electric Middle Earth Saturday on ETS. Sounds like a good show. Am going to see Scott Miller and the Commonwealth at Down Home that night.

      Kurt, thanks for the kind words about "mother loves me anyway" that too was one of my favorites but difficult to play. I four tracked your version and played all the instruments on it. Electric Middle Earth will be doing that one live on the Studio One Radio program this Sat.Oct.12 @1:00 live. Mike says hi too! I will be sidelined for a few months with shoulder surgery in a few weeks and we are looking for a temporary drummer or bassist so we can continue playing out. I play the drum/bass and sing for those of you who haven't seen us. Jason also can drum/bass equally well, so we have to decide if we need a drummer or bassist.

      Hi everyone, Kurt here, former long hair and guitarist for Brian and the Nightmares.  I noticed Juile in her first post mentioned that when the band formed she and I were dating.  An amusing side story, Juile's mom did not like the looks of me.  I remember well driving up to Julies House in the summer of '85, a Black Sabbath 8 track (yes, 8 track) in the stereo of my redneck muscle-mobile, and getting the fish eye from Mrs. Fann. Someone told me later Mrs. Fann's assessment of me was as follows:  "Pasty-faced, long hair, probably on drugs." I also saw Doug Hilliard posting.  My first memory of Doug and Electric Middle Earth is when Mike,  Doug's brother, played me a song of Dougs called "mother loves me anyway"  I fell in love with that song, it's so dreamy.  I still have a copy of it, if anybody cares to hear it, I'm always open to making a mix tape for my old friends.   Love, Kurt

      Actually, John Gardner wrote the modernized version of "Beowulf" titled "Grendel"---the story is told from the point of view of the monster.   Don't mean to turn this into a literary forum.

      Isn't Seamus Heaney the guy that wrote the modernized version of "Beowolf"?  And is it a coincidence that the first words spoken by Sean Connery in the role of James Bond were to a Bond girl named "Plenty O'Toole" ("Named after your father perhaps")?  And didn't Andy Boy do a song called "James Bond" in which the singer confesses his sexual attraction for James Bond?  Further, we should note that Sean Connery also made a movie called "Outland"  Berkely Breathed changed the name of his comic strip from "Bloom County" to "Outland"  Andy Boy once changed it's name to "The Acid Cows" and;  The Acid Cows used one of the Characters from Bloom County in one of thier posters ("Go see the Acid Cows, It's real fun")  I suppose we are to beleive that this is all coincidental, or heat lightening, or swamp gas, but it should be becoming clear that....well I'm not actually sure what it all means, but it means something that I'm sure the government does not want us to know!!  Until next time, don't forget to drink only pure rain water!

      Seamus. What a name. Sounds awfully similar to semen. Clinton must know this. Or maybe he's an O'Toole fan, or a follower of the Nobel prize-winning Irish poet, Seamus Heaney. I doubt it. I once had a Chia (or is it Chea, or Schiea?) pet named Seamus. It died.

      Peter O'Toole.....if it's not an assumed name it should be.  I'm sure a porn star would have used it if Mr. O'Toole hadn't made it big. lol.  On another note...I was watching Boomeraction on cartoon netwerk the other night.  Anyway...they play te old Hanna Barbera stuff from the seventies like Johnny Quest, Space Ghost and the Herculoids.  On this night the Herculoids were fighting an evil guy named "Faelac" who's hover ship looked a lot like a ....well, you can guess.  The only way to stop him was to destroy the helmet of power he wore...which was crowned with an antenna that looked much like......his ship.  I laughed as hard as the art director for that episode must have laughed the morning it aired.  MARK!!!!  What's up!  Good to hear from you.  Oh, Brook...I read your entry about the Titans and had to make sure of the date you posted.....they look worse than a two dollar New Orleans whore.

      I sincerely wish I could help Spam, but as of this time I can only confirm that I was in on the planning of the first 3 or 4, I think 3 were held at Dr. Spangler's farm, and the last was a road trip to New Orleans. I made the BBQ sauce, though Roland and Tony usually cooked the ribs. At the first one I played Ralph to a draw in Trivial Pursuit. There was alot of beer, and usually Quarterbacks could be shut down for the weekend when we held one......Anybody up for it again????

      OH....MY....GOD...did someone mention the Hindu Rib Roast?  For those of you out-of-the-loop types, the HRR was the party.  Not A party, THE party.  A full-on, slam-bang, take no prisoners assault upon our tender little minds.  Shit, it even had a body count. Among my admittedly foggy memories of this liver-dessicating event are : James Arwood piercing Barbara Herds (Now Vance...yes, I'm talking about Drews wife) ear with a rusty safety pin and a potato(!!!), Tony Coker cracking his skull by diving into a swimmming pool containing only a foot or so of water, Doug Bernhardt being thrown into said pool while INSIDE a pup tent (and still not waking up), some crazy-ass farmer attempting to sell his children, cows walking around inside the house, and...the very last time Little Wade was seen alive.  This was one barn-burner of a party, not to be forgott...that is, remembered by those who attended.  Did I mention Johnny Hicks chasing the sheep?  Argh!  My memories are running together like colored play-doh in the Sahara. Too many psychedelics will do that to you, I suppose..  (Remember kids, Just Say More!) One of you more lucid types fill in some of these blanks for me, ya?  Until then, I've got nuthin to do but scratch words in the dirt and watch the water roll down...

      Hindu Fucking Rib Roast ---- What the UT/Florida game resembled from the bleachers. I know this because I was there, sitting on the 40 yard line in the pouring rain wearing an orange rain poncho like all the other fans. We looked like psychedelic hindus, or the grim reaper who happened to be wearing the wrong color. In fact, I believe one of the guys sitting behind me stood up and shouted during the third quarter, “What do you think this is?!!!!!  A Hindu fucking rib roast?!!!!!”

      Lisa, In the archives I saw your mention of Johnny Hicks and the incident at the Pub (if it was the pub then) when he wrote choice phrases on the backs of women's hands while he worked the door. I don't think that meant anything at all other than- that his social skills were somewhat regrettable at the time.  I saw him a couple of years ago at the tattoo shop that used to be across the street from the bus station on Main. I was in there to use the phone (boring story) and the guy behind the counter looked a lot like him, and was. He said he was taking a breather from Seattle. We actually had a decent conversation, and he looked well---I’d heard bad reports about his health. He showed me his tattoos---one that extended from his right hip to his ankle, a nice rendering of a mummy, and another on his abdomen, extending to his pelvis, of Satan. They were definitely interesting. Was weird---went in there to use the phone and ended up staring at a picture of Satan on Johnny Hick’s pelvis. Who says Johnson City is boring?

      I remember Ralph Womanslayer well. He was eventualy taken down by a group of enraged, drunken lesbians.  This is absolutely true.  I, however, posess the only perfectly unblemishished record in our football history.  You see, I hate sports.  Sports?  Hate 'em.  (Except rasslin!  Man Howdy I luuuvs me some rasslin!)  But after much ridicule from friend and foe alike, I decided to be a part of one of their little games.  So I enter the game, and about ten seconds in I find myself holding the ball!  (Apparently no one was aware I sucked.)  I turn and begin pumping my little legs as fast as I could toward the end zone.  By Gawd TOUCHDOWN!!!!  This, for me, was unprecedented, having always been the one to hear "Coach, do we have to take HIM?"  I felt invigorated.  I felt  validated!  I felt about two hundred or so pounds of Roland Tester slam into me with the force of an angry redneck who just got his 4X4 scratched.  My head hit so hard I wouldn't be suprised to see a divot in the ground there to this day.  Yeah, you knocked the living crap out of me, but you were TOO SLOW Tester!  I then retired from football, with the ONLY perfect record in our group.  One interception, one touchdown.  Yes, I rule. Heed Spam. Spam is good.  Spam is wise.  Spam makes an excellent party dip.

      Hey Mark! It's good to know you are alive and doing o.k. I was the person who mentioned Claudia and Linda Barrett (Linda I'd completely forgotten about). I never knew either of them very well, so I wouldn't know where they are now, but should I hear about them for some reason somewhere I'll let you know. Heard via Maria Bledsoe that you've been in touch with Beth Bivins a bit. She's a hoot. Did you know I was with you the first time I ever drank any real amount of alcohol? I drank four White Mountain wine coolers. We were driving around somewhere out in rural J.C. if I remember correctly. Rite of passage. I hope you're doing well.

      Reading back over the blog from end to end, a question jumped out at me and then wouldn't leave me alone. Why was it such a big deal that the Nightmares covered "Suffragette City?" Well good gawd awmighty, lemme see...I was in the 7th grade in 1974, and me and my one little girlfriend I grew up riding horses with in Kingsport were the only ones in our school who liked T. Rex and Gary Glitter and Lou Reed (oh yes, Lou had a heavy eye make up period) and well, gosh, Bowie too, and "Suffragette City" was a way we defined ourselves to ourselves in a lovely world of androgyny where girls could be boys and boys could be girls in a mixed up muffled up shook up kind of a way, you dig? Now a lot of water HAD passed under the bridge in 12 years, so there was no approximate meaning that could ever be the same, but still...it had to be an omen, like. To walk into a redneck bar called "Cowboys" and hear it? Creapin' fuckin' jesus, how absurdly cool was that? It was a moment of absolute sublimity, surrealness in spades. And guys, if you want to take this as a hint for the set list...I'll make you some cookies? Better yet, I'll tie an apron on you and teach you to make them yourselves, so you never have to be without cookies again. In fact, I think it would look awfully cute if you wore aprons to the gigs...Ah, the good times. Let them roll.

Second, as I have said before, it's ok to say "FUCK" here, "Brook" rarely censors; see: F**K, F**K, F**K....Aww come on Brook,   Anyway, in answer to your question, several of us have discussed "Elizabeth Williams" and I have yet to meet anyone who knows her. Based on this I propose that "Elizabeth Williams" is a pen name, or as the french say: "le pen name",  for none other than "Brook." Now no doubt Brook and Elizabeth will both deny this, BUT ISN'T THAT JUST WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT A GHOST WRITER AND A PEN NAME TO SAY?????? Also we must examine the possibility that "Brook" is a pen name for none other than JULIE FANN! Ask yourself, have why have you never seen all three of them together???  Finally, Who the fuck are Gretchen and Nina???

      This is so weird and funny, I have to tell. I received a press release at work about this group in Florida who are worried because a company down there is making what they called “an Osama-bin-Laden doll”. Out of curiosity, I called the company, which is nothing but two or three guys renting out a space somewhere. The guy I talked to said the dolls originated in Europe, and they decided to make and market them here too. (the legalities of that would be iffy I would think.) The supposed “Osama” doll is just a doll that’s supposed to be an Arab. Is wearing a turban, and when you press a button, it says “Why you talk in front of my back?” and also “I order cheeseburger, but, no meat please”. The guy played this for me over the phone. Other dolls the company makes are a Jewish American Princess doll who says (he played all these back to me), “I don’t care if it IS circumcized, I’m not putting it in my mouth.” Also, a horny Chinese guy who says, “Don’t worry. I put peanut oil on it, and it slide in reeaaal easy.” Also a redneck doll named Bubba. Can’t remember what he says but something having to do with a remote control and beer. The dolls cost $14.  Re: SoCon hoops. the sports guys here at the paper are really into it.

      Amazing what sleep will do. I just spent the weekend in Atlanta at the downtown Hilton, in a very nice room. After working a bazillion hours during the election while suffering from lung snot, I finally relaxed in the BEST possible way, so now have a renewed appreciation for all things indulgent.   Politicians are nothing but great big wads of chewing gum on the sole of the go-go boot of life, but everyone seems to think there's just something wrong with the dance floor. Doesn't compare to everyone else's commentary, but oh well. Go Miami.

      Totalitarian --  The scorched political landscape the Republicans have created since Whitewater, the Impeachment and the stolen election, has been totalitarian in tenor and I would say, stated goals. Now they have control of all three branches of govenment as well as the mainstream media. The usual wackos like Rush Limbaugh, and Roger Ailes' Fox News channel is frightening enough, but add to that the ever present drum beat coming from right wing (mainstream) takeover of the Wall Street Journal and the NY Times and you have no outlet for reasoned discussion of the matters which concern most of the american public.   So, not totalitarian just because it's wholly a Republican-run show now -- but totalitarian b/c that's what the likes of Richard Mellon Scaife, Ted Olson, and Dick Cheney have been playing for since the downfall of poppy Bush and some would say since Watergate.

      That is a tradition dating back to 1992, when Newt declared the Dems to be Totalitarians as a result of Republican losses in the House, Senate and White House. I don't subscribe to that notion now anymore than then. I also beleive that winning by less than 1% nationwide does not a mandate make!   When I was a child in the Boy Scouts I fished the rivers and lakes around here. In high school we would skip out early to get to the Steam Plant in Rogersville in Feb. when the stripes were running out of Cherokee lake to the warmer water by the plant. I once caught a Sauger and it scared the hell out of me as their markings look alot like a rattle snake.... I think the fish around here that puts up the best fight, pound for pound, are the brown trout in the watauga river. Carp and other bottom dwellers are often beaten on the rocks by fishermen locally. Carp were imported from Japan, and are choking the waterways of the south.

       I caught a fish too.  A bunch of us went to Watauga Lake, put worms on a hook, slung them into the water, shoved the pole handles into the ground and propped the poles up with forked sticks.  Then we went into a nearby cave, built a fire and got drunk and stoned all night.  The next morning we all went down to the lake to gather up the poles, but my line was caught on something.  I said, "Hey, my line is caught on something."  Tom said, "It's not caught, there's a fish on it!  Reel it in."  So I did.  Pulled out a seven or eight pound bass, which we fried and ate with scrambled eggs.  Since my presence wasn't actually required to catch the fish, I decided to just for-go that part of the experience from then on.    Why is it that when your side wins an election it is democracy, but if the other side wins an election it is totalitarianism?  Inquiring minds want to know.

      Damn that's a hell of an image....... anyway, I disagree Elizabeth, when the Democrat party effectivly reaches out to the middle ground we win. This was the way Clinton wrested the White House from Bush the First. Bush the Second can be beaten the same way, with the same issue. Note I say issue. The Democrat party is a big umbrella, with alot of folks under it. Each wants it's perspective to the forefront, and each has some validity to their position. But when we smother ourselves in issues we lose focus. The single Republican issue in the last election was "We are very American and we should go to war with Iraq because Bush Says So. If you don't support our drug plan/tax break/etc., you are not a very good american."  The issue to beat the Republican Party is, as it was in 1992, "Gee, you guys suck at running an Economy"  This should be our mantra as we go forward from now. With it we can claim the middle ground and the left. America always votes it's pocketbook. Remind Americans that we have in 2 years gone from a $175 billion surplus to a $350 billion deficit (a great deal of which is due to the tax breaks no one asked for, prior to 9/11). If this is how George balances his checkbook, imagine what he will do over the next 2 years!!! And he will have no one to blame it on except Trent "I can't go to Vietnam, I'm a Cheerleader"  Lott. It is also fun to note that George "I can't go to Vietnam, I'm AWOL in Alabama to the point of Desertion" Bush has only one veteran on his forign policy team, Colin "I was in Vietnam defending Bill's right to be a smart ass, so you really should give me some respect" Powell, and he is the one who has spoken against going to war in Iraq......but I digress. We will be back, because they have no one to blame but themselves now, and they suck at taking responsibility too. Most are still trying to figure out how the Democrats are responsible for Enron and World Com....  And another thing, I once wrote an article for PST called "Bass Fishing in America"

      Well fuck me doubled over, Brook...I had to turn off the tv to read your last blog. I know this is really going to raise hackles, but here goes. What you're saying about Dems courting the "middle" being shit for a strategy is precisely why I waved the Green flag last time. My point now as it was then is that the Democratic party needs to turn left to win elections; this "conventional wisdom" of going for the so-called middle has lost resoundingly at least the last two times. The clinical definition of insanity is repeating the same behaviour over and over and expecting different results. I still maintain that leftists or outsiders had no moral duty to jump on a Dem band-wagon headed in the wrong direction to keep them from losing an election; the Dems had a moral and pragmatic duty to move the party in a direction that would secure the vote that was crucial for them to win. But did anybody learn a fucking thing from all this? Not that I can see. I still vote Dem because I think I'd rather have cancer than polio. So "Fuck that!" works real well for me.

      Brook: Wow. I'm at work, laying out the front of tomorrow's paper, and have, all week, and especially last night and today, been crying a lot over the same stuff you just said. I feel such despair over our political situation anymore in this country, a country that, in many ways, I've come to despise, and I despise that too. And I have bronchitis, so everything seems ten times worse. would say more but am pressed for time and absolutely, unspeakably, exhausted. Glad you said all that.

      For a left-leaning, drug-munching liberal arts student, much of the charm of living in Johnson City, Tennessee was being an outsider. In a small mountain town, you can't hide your true colors; everyone has an ax to grind; and there's plenty of time for the airing of greivances. There were times when I felt like everyone at WalMart or sitting at the red light on Roan Street was a gun-toting, god-fearing, blood-thristy survivalist bent on hunting down dissenters. East Tennessee is as conservative as it is remote. Which is part of the reason why the bonds shared by people of like mind are so special.    Just for old times' sake, I'm going to share something with you guys. I am pissed off. It is November 6 and I woke up to the news of a Republican-controlled government from stem to stern. Some would call that totalitarian. I'm one of them. Brook's not happy today.    Emailing back and forth between blood relatives (who have to listen patiently), I formed a thought that I'm going to share with you guys. It's long. If you don't like it, blog more and it will go away soon enough. It's political... you all knew I would rant politically sooner or later. It's only marginally relevant to the music scene, but here it is.   __________________________  What it means to be an outsider   Lets just face it, Democrats suck at insider politics. You would think that since Al Gore lost the election (it was stolen, I know), we would take a hint that the "insider" game wasn't working so well and realize there is no more room at the "middle." The Republicans have colonized this historically Democratic-controlled territory -- the vast middle ground where Americans frolic happily with 2.4 children and a secure, if not buxom retirement account.   Otherwise knuckle-dragging paleo-conservatives have "rehabilitated" their image by seeming to move to the middle -- adding "compassionate" to the conservative label. They get away with this because no one challenges them in the lie. Thereby a "faith-based initiative" isn't so much the destruction of the separation between church and state because no one stands up to say "NO matter what you call it, it's still state-sponsored religion." An imperialistic campaign to war for booty in Iraq, isn't so much the destruction of the world's collective security, if no one is there to say "NO, we won't let you take the world to war for oil."   How does a Democrat "rehabilitate" their image without a middle ground to go to? The conventional wisdom of "moving to the middle" -- support the tax cut, support the war -- is an mirage. It's a heat wave rising from the newly charred ground after 9-11. Wars and tax cuts for the rich aren't middle-ground issues -- they are the antithesis of it.   The republicans are wink and nod when they put "compassionate" in front of conservatism. It's like Jumbo Shrimp. Shrimp can be big -- in relation to other very small things. And so, conservatives can be compassionate --  in relation to other lying, mean-spirited, greedy bastards. Draw a happy face on Jesse Helms and you get George Bush (put a feather boa on him and you get Jesse Ventura). Cross-dressing for conservatives.    And here's the breath-taking irony -- when conservatives LIE about what they really intend to do, people like them better, because they are drawing a happy face on the greedy bastard. Every Democrat should know this and call them on it without hesitation. Nobody wants clear-cutting, corporate-raiding, evangelical theocrats running the country. So, what do we, the Democrats, do as a strategic counter-move? We draw a greedy bastard face on a smiley. By jockeying for the vanishing "middle ground" Democrats LIE about what they intend to do, thereby diminishing their appeal. Tarnishing their image from one of compassion and hope, to one of competition for scarce resources. "As Democrats, we are answering your call to join in the spirit of bipartisanship with our brethren, the Republicans, in revoking your freedoms, raping the environment and eroding the middle class. We know this is what you want or else you won't vote for us."  Who in their right mind would think this was a good strategy?   Mondale said today in his concession speech that our ideals are tested more in defeat than in victory. Well, no shit. And I'm sick and tired of it. The environment doesn't have any more time to wait on our ideals. The middle class needs a victory of their own. Now is the time for hope, ideas and action -- outsider politics fueled by the courage of conviction.   It's time for a new Contract For America. Maybe we can call it something less corporate-sounding. I know it's not catchy, but how about, "The Battle Between Good and Evil." When the stakes are this high, there is no sense in parsing words. The time for accommodation is over, and outsider status affords the Democrats the opportunity to lay waste to the strategic disaster of patriotic bipartisanship.   The Democratic agenda isn't about prescription drugs. It's not about deficits. It's not about pension reform (especially when hardly anyone has one). It's about being decent people in a world that requires good citizenship because without civil order, everything goes to hell and that ain't good for business. The republicans want to put the cart before the horse. If it ain't good for business, then it ain't good for you. Well, fuck that. When was the last time a business you worked for gave a shit about you. You are a Human Resource the same way a pencil is a Material Resource. Sharpen it down to a nub and throw it away.    The Democrats have lost their way, so we must help them remember who they are, and I have two words that will help them stay on track. The words are, "Fuck That." Trust me, you'll have the opportunity to use these two words copiously in the next two years of Republican totalitarianism.   When the (Republican) agenda is about to going to war and the Democratic agenda is about to going to war more slowly, you say, "Fuck That!" Say it to yourself; to the television; to the people at the water cooler; and to the people at the protest. When the (Republican) agenda is to drill for oil in the Arctic Preserve, you say, "Fuck That!" When the agenda is confirmation of another wacko wing-nut conservative nominee for a judge-ship, you say... FUCK THAT!   Don't be an outsider because it's what's left. Be an outsider because it's what's right.

      Is it just me or does it seem to everyone that the estrogen contingent has issues with the Prudes??? I always liked the shock value presented by any new band, The Nightmares were shockingly slick the first time I saw them, Stinky Finger was shockingly shocking the first time....But after I first saw the Prudes I had to peel my jaw from the floor. They were so different from what everyone else was doing. I agree that they did not take their drinking seriously enough, and they were probably too much Prude and not enough Fucking, but to fault them for being talentless seems, well, kind of mean.....considering that we put up with "The Russ Onks Experience"; or maybe I'm just sensitive to the "Talentless" judgment as it hits so close to home!

       Yes, there was a rickety old farm house. Yes, there were animals looking into the pane-less windows, especially a cow. Yes, there was the disgusting hamburger you speak of that also sat in the trunk of somebody's car all afteroon before we pulled it out and tried to make hamburgers.  It was VERY warm and wouldn't stick together enough to make patties.  Franky's mom, Frau Spangler, who was snot drunk and running around with a switchblade (all night people were coming up to me saying "Dude, did you know there's some German woman running around here with a switchblade?") whipped up a tomato sauce and suggested we make sloppy joes!  As far as I remember, nobody ate one except me and Roland ( who ate two).   I wonder if we lived.

      Thanks a lot, Barbara! Now, Drew and Hans are gonna get jealous of each other and start all that "choose one of us or leave us both" talk. It'll take me weeks, months maybe, to sort this out. For the record, I love them both. How can I be expected to choose?  As everyone has said, the shows were great fun. I don't have any great stories to add, but I will say thanks to everyone who came out. Thanks very much to the Nightmares for asking us to help them recreate the whole thing. I talked with John on the phone today, and we both said that we didn't have plans for New Year's because last Friday and Saturday pretty much represented our New Year's party.   I wish I could think of something to say except thanks, but I can't. So I'll just leave it at that. Happy New Year! Be safe about it, though. You'll want to be alive for when that sort of weekend ever happens again, if it ever does.  --Plez

       Happy New Years Eve everyone!  On behalf of the band, Brian, Kurt, Mark, Tad, and myself, I want to thank everyone who came out this weekend. To say these reunion shows were one of the highlights of my year would be an understatement. I am very humbled by the enthusiasm all the people showed us this weekend and I hope we gave back as much as we got. It is all of you that made the Nightmares the band that it was. If it was not for all our fans in JC and the other clubs we played on the chitlin' circuit, this band would have been a footnote in my life. Instead, it has been a life changing experience. All of you are like my extended family and this was a fantastic family reunion.  It has taken several days for me just to process what happened over the weekend before I could begin to write about it on the blog. These last few months of practice with the band and the two shows this weekend has reminded me how much music is a necessary part of my life. I will always make sure that I keep it alive in my soul and I hope all of you do the same.  I want to say a special thanks to the Pleztones. Scott, Drew, James, Hans, Gary, Phil, Ron and of course Scott's dad, the elder megaplez. I'm glad that you chose to share a special weekend with all of us. You guys rocked!  Dan... what can I say.  It sounded great on stage and made the shows much easier than they could have been. We could use you a sound engineer like you in Nashville. Thanks!  Many thanks to Burt for allowing us a place to gather and for keeping the club going for 20 years. That is 100 in club years. Here's to the next 20 years! Johnny Be Good!  And I can't  forget the Down Home. If they did not exist, I don't think the I would have done the things I did with music. They gave me an outlet for my early musical adventures (Andy Boy, one of the many members of Final Curtain, etc.) when I was in high school as well as a place for the early Nightmares to germinate unencumbered by actually being able to play on stage. Thank god for sunglasses.  Thank you all for one amazing time. I could not think of a more fitting end to 2002.   Everyone be safe tonight and have a Happy New Year!

       50 years ago tonight - somewheres betwixt Knoxville and Oak Hill, WV - Hank Williams died.   Recorded by: Hank Williams, Sr. Written by: Hank Williams, Sr.  I can [Am] settle down and be doin' just fine Til I [E7] hear an old train rollin' down the [Am] line Then I hurry straight home and pack And if I [E7] didn't go, I believe I'd blow my [Am] stack I love you baby, but you gotta understand When the [E7] Lord made me He made a Ramblin' [Am] Man.  Some folks might say that I'm no good That I wouldn't settle down if I could But when that open road starts to callin' me There's somethin' o'er the hill that I gotta see Sometimes it's hard but you gotta understand When the Lord made me, He made a Ramblin' Man.  I love to see the towns a-passin' by And to ride these rails 'neath God's blue sky Let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea 'Cause that's the life I believe He meant for me And when I'm gone and at my grave you stand Just say God called home your Ramblin' Man.

      Don't be fooled Mike, Brook tried Saturday night to prove to me the existence of Elizabeth Williams, by way of introducing me to her. When I confronted Brook that she had merely paid this person to say she was "Miss Williams", Brook admitted that she paid her $50 an hour. This was in the parking lot during the break and was captured on video by Brook. In addition, once back inside I introduced Bruce Honeycutt to a person that looked by the inside light like the one Brook introduced me to, it turned out to be none other than Drew. The video speaks for itself, but you can ask Bruce about this second incident....proof, as if more were needed!!!!

      Ah yes, equal opportunity.  There were annoying drunk men, too.  But, on this night it was the ladies causing me the most trouble (story of my life.. heh heh).  David, thanks for the CD version of the Buck Fifty recordings.  I've actually got three of the original tapes (that still have the Back Door price tag on 'em, believe it or not), but a CD will last much longer.  The musician in me grimaces at some of those recordings.  But, it's very cool to have such a historical document.    Other interesting moments of the weekend: 1)  Marion still remembering that I always ordered a slice of cheese and a mountain dew everytime I came in the joint;  2) Momentarily losing my coat (which contained said Buck Fifty CD and my cell phone), only to find that good people (Lisa and Sarah) had moved it with theirs to the side;  3)  Seeing a "Scullsoup" flyer in the entrance (do they still play???);  4)  Wishing I could show off my favorite new hobby (swing dancing) during a few of the nightmares tunes, but not having nearly enough room to do it. :)  Gary

      Alan: The pictures are great, and I wish I could somehow download them as a screensaver or somethin’. And good to hear the run-down of the Friday set and Saturday’s encores, since I wasn’t there for those.   Man, I’ve never in my life seen my brother dance (it’s just not “him”) but he sure was cuttin’ a rug at that show! I think he was impressed that I know such cool, smart, talented people. I almost wish I had been there Friday instead though, since Saturday was so crowded, and we ended up staring at a bunch of unattractive ass even though we had a primo table up front. Who were those people on the stage anyway? Does anyone know who they were? (If anyone out there was one of them, I didn’t mean YOUR ass.) Also, I missed seeing a bunch of the old UH crowd Friday--Michael Miller, Martin, Doug Powell, and others. I did see Phil Bowman though and had trouble remembering his damn name. Unnerving. And Scott, you looked great and sounded great too. Todd was so happy to see you and everyone else. “American Band” absolutely rocked.  I enjoyed the entire show---from start to finish. Oh, and Rodney Webb. Wow. I was SO thrilled to see him since I’ve been thinking about him a lot lately. It was truly great to see all of you again. I think I’d kind of forgotten how much fun it really was.

      Drunk women having no respect for others? Hopefully, you’re not talking about my wife. Actually, don’t pick on the women, there were some drunk men having no respect for others too. OK, so I had enough to constitute a fearful bar tab, but I think I stayed respectful. Donna had to fend off a very rude encroacher who persisted in holding a cigarette to her face. Finally she pushed him away and told him to back off. After all, we carved out our little spot in front of Kurt and managed to hold ground there for both nights. Saturday I wore an awful coat that didn’t fit and ended up throwing it on the floor and letting Kim Blevins use it as a dance matt since her shoes were killing her and she was dying to take them off.  I had an absolute ball seeing everyone too. Barbara, wow, you looked great, and it was wonderful to see you and Drew again. I even checked in with the mysterious Elizabeth Williams. Gary, I wanted to introduce you to Donna, but the show started, I went nuts, and when the smoke finally cleared I guess you were already gone. Donna said Guffey motioned her over to meet you, but I was somewhere else and she was stuck defending our spot, which had our stuff (drinks, purse, coats, and most importantly, prime dance real estate). Look us up next time you’re in town.  Finally, after the shows we hung around just to gush to the band guys about how great they were. I’ve had a pretty full plate in life lately, so it was a pleasant switch to just be a music fan-boy again for a short while. To the Pleztones and the Nightmares, again, I salute you. How about next Christmas?

      What can I say?  They were great.  So much energy between the crowd and the band.  Now I have many of those great songs swirling around in my brain for the first time in 12 years!  Brian mentioned to the crowd that the last time all 4 were on stage together, Ronald Reagan was in the White House.  Heard that John Smith has the original tapes of their two studio releases and is planning to release a CD(s).  Is this correct?  Friday night really rocked.  The local cable company taped the first set only.  I saw many "ghosts" both nights.  By ghosts I mean people that I recognized from the old days but never knew their names.  Hello ghosts!!!  Kurt played his old Telecaster with his Mom's (correct?) picture on it and thru the same Fender amp he bought in '88.  Brian played a black Rickenbacker.  Similar to the natural stained Rickenbacker he bought at the Roan St. Gulf station (with his gas card).    John Smith brought all his basses including a 12 string!  Never seen one of those before.  Total bass string count: 28!  Bleu Jackson was there Friday night looking eerily like David Lee Roth.  Should've taken his picture.  I called out for "Eye of the Tiger", "Brick House" and "She Thinks I Still Care"  0 for 3.  OK - Friday night set list:  Set 1  Forget About You Keep Walking Good Guys Don't Wear White (The Standells - finally I know who did this song originally!)  Desperate Hyway Easy Way Out She's So Tall (this one kicked ass!  Strained a neck muscle pogo-ing to it).  I Am a Rock Primitive Rose Lizard Song Can't Touch an Angel (with glowing mirrorball on Saturday night! Holy Vishnu!)  Little Bit of You Route 66 All You Do Is Sin   Set 2 (my opinion the best of the 4 sets played over the weekend):  Stephanie Talk Too Much Whip It  Runaway Trains Nash County Ramblin Man  Surfboard Hyway Song Look the Other Way You Think of Me  Jonesboro Woman Batman Parish Going Nowhere  Encore: When Your Heart Gets Ripped in 2 These Boots Were Made for Walkin' Daydream  Johnny B. Goode (with special guest vocalist Burt!) I Wanna Rock n' Roll All Night (Mark Ryalls on vocals)  Saturday night.  Not much dancing space.  Very crowded. Brian and Kurt couldn't keep their guitars in tune, especially Kurt's Gretsch.  A much looser night (music wise).  Set 1:  same as Friday night except for one surprise.  When they played "Little Bit of You" they brought Tad Dickens up on stage to play guitar.  Very Kool.  Tad and Mark shook hands on stage (a very "VH1: Behind the Music" moment).  Set 2:  Same as Friday night except after "Whip It" they inserted the Cramps' "New Kind of Kick."  After "Look the Other Way", they played "Daydream" instead of "You Think of Me"  First Encore:  Johnny B. Goode (w/ Burrrrt) Paint It Black (I called out for this one!) These Boots... Shake It All Over (Johnny Kidd and the Pirates) Get Out Baby  (Brian's soliloquy for Get Out Baby involved meeting a woman in a sports bar who is throwing chicken wing bones at the TV while watching a hockey game.  He is on a junket and invites her upstairs.  Things are going smoothly until he invites her to a Titans football game.  She's an Eagles' fan and tells him to "GET OUT!!!")  Second Encore:  What's Her Name (Warren Zevon) I Wanna Rock n' Roll All Night

      Yes, Gary's comment inspires me to share the last night's SCARIEST moment: Standing in the shadows under the left balcony, Drew nudged me and asked, "Is that a belly chick on Scott?" And sure enough, it was. She managed to back the Megaplez into a corner by doing what looked like a crab-claw twisting of chunks of his flesh. Not to fear. Scott's honor was deftly defended by the luscious Leslie Landreth, as gracious and true a babe as ever was on this earth. I swear the thought cloud above her head said, "There are certain things up with which one will not put." Meanwhile, I think Sara and I were doing a subconscious mental inventory of the empty beer bottles close at hand and their various methods of deployment.

      Good people, good people.  I got home after the Saturday nightmares show and realized that I'd been smiling for 5 solid hours.  From the moment I walked into the room (which in itself took a little while due to a mix up with the ticketweb report they had at the door... thanks for saving us Brook!) to the time that we left, I just grinned.  It was an absolute thrill to see people that I'd not seen in such a long time.  Plez, Leslie, Barbara, Lisa, Sarah, Brook, Ditty, David, Bobby, Whit, Julia, Drew, Hans, Phil Bowman, Mike Hilliard (who is not only JC royalty, but also one of my favorite humans), John, Marion, and Kurt.  Seeing Kurt on stage again really made me miss being in Gumption.  Different era, but still very good times.  I know there are others who I'm forgetting.  But, it was the type of reunion that I will appreciate for some time to come.  Of course, there were aspects of the show that made me remember things that I *didn't* like about nightmares shows in "the era," specifically drunk women dancing and having absolutely no respect for the space of others.  But, putting up with that was well worth the the memories.  I didn't get to say goodbye to many folks as we darted out rather quickly toward the end of the night.  But, it was really great to see everyone.  Gary

      JC Reunion shows, woo-HOO!! Not a finer time to be had, y'all. It's just like riding a bicycle, now ain't it! TOUR!! TOUR!! Tour...? What's scary for me is how totally adapted I am to rock&roll hours again, what Kurt referred to last night as "the legendary Johnson City party pace"...less than two days, it's all right back with me. I know exactly how to do THIS lifestyle choice.  It took me ten years to get used to getting up at 8 o'clock. And it still sucks ass. Where's the bus?  What a blast to see Rodney Webb, Gary Miller, Bobby, David Guffey, Martin Patrick, Leslie, Pat & Angie, Jael...And with kids! The second generation is shaping up. Remember parents, keep working on that plan for global domination. (Found myself thinking about Mike and Lynne an awful lot these past few days, also.) Brook and I collected a gob of new email addresses, so look for fresh bloggers soon.   Major props go, too, to the Plezbygod and the 'Tonesbygod and their stellar roster of guest artists, the mighty Hans Rotenberry (who writes a mean haiku, too, by the way), Mike Hilliard, who is rock&roll royalty in this town, too (even though I know he'll never see this) and then...The Professor. Next time your car gets a flat in the pouring rain, stop a moment and picture in your mind...The Professor. I defy a smile to come to your face. Kudos, sir.

      hey fellow bloggerts -- since there's been a bunch of confusion about tickets for the nightmare's gig this weekend... thought i'd give a run down.   if you've purchased tickets thru ticketweb, you are good to go. if you have purchased them and are picking them up on a willcall basis, you are also good to go (brian even made your willcall pickup envelopes for ya).   if you are waiting to purchase tickets at the door, here's the deal --   FRIDAY: you can purchase on ticketweb until noon. after that, the remainder will be available at the door. it looks like there might be 50 left for the door on friday after the noon deadline. maybe more. if you show up early on friday, i think you will be able to get tickets at the door.  SATURDAY, there's only 24 tickets left as of tonite, thursday, so i doubt there will be any at the door by deadline (sat noon). get them on ticketweb now if you need saturday tickets.   that's all -- hope santa was good to everyone. if yer in JC and have nothing planned, get down to the casbah tonite to see scott pleasant do an acoustic set.

      Yes, I have no life. That’s why I’m writing the day after Christmas. Weird thing happened yesterday. I typed in an obituary at work for a guy, and one of the pallbearers was one Johnny Hicks. After work, I went to the Down Home and who was there but..Johnny Hicks. Said he wasn’t attending any funerals.  I think he needs an invitation to blog. He said he might come to the Saturday night show. So maybe we’ll all see him there, sporting a short, conservative hairstyle and an L.L. Bean-type jacket. He lives in Knoxville now.

      The vomit's coming, Bill. I promise. To Continue the story, however..... I just assumed that Bruce and I were personally banned from the Down Home. After a half hour or so on the sidewalk, explaining to Bruce what happened to him , we went on to QBs to share our adventure with Bill, Rick and Roland. A big laugh was had by all and the incicent was quickly buried beneath the next pitcher of beer. Shortly after this incident, the Johnson City Press decided that perhaps the JC music scene might be more interesting than the newest apple pie recipe. Kudos to all for garnering their interest. Down Home being the premier musical venue, Phil, by god, Leonard was the one interviewed and quoted in the article. At that point in time, there were the 'mares, Catfish Special (Brian's brother, Chip "Dead Eye" Justice and the effervescent Roland Tester), and Final Curtain. In this article, we discovered a few of things that we didn't know before:  1) Down Home is a music club (we thought they were closed on mondays for religious reasons) 2) Final Curtain didn't play music (E A D G C still sound like music to me) 3) Final Curtain would no longer be playing at the Down Home {thanks, Phil, by god, Leonard for telling us before a public humiliation)  We were all shocked and dumbfounded. Yes, I'M an asshole, but how the hell did Bruce's bleeding pate lead us to this point?

              Alright Bill , you want vomit and lots of it. I will tell you a story about my  youngest daughter Bonnie . When she was maybe 3 months old she was perhaps the best mass producer of projectile vomit the world has seen since little Regan in The Exorsist. Good volume, perfect viscosity, and a silky smooth texture. One afternoon my lovely wife Marsha was about to put the little nipper in her hi chair, when li'l Bonnie decided to spray vomit all over the dining room carpet, walls furniture and all. This in itself is bad but Marsha was in a panic and kept holding our beautiful baby girl while she was doing her best pressure driven spooge hose imitation. Whatever was in the direction Marsha turned with Bonnie, recived a good base and top coat of oatmeal and formula. We had to remodel the dining room after that. I won't get into all the baby poop stories til later

As I recall, GSI briefly changed it's name to "Unexpected Vomit" as a result!  Merry Christmas to all. At one time I was too lazy to mail Christmas cards. Now, thanks to advanced technology, I am too lazy to E-mail Christmas cards.

James fired up a joint (I demurred) and passed it to Bruce who took a giant drag off of it that must've gone down the wrong way because Bruce's liquid refreshment that he had consumed promptly came up; "BLOOP BLOOP", quoth he, as James, myself, and Julie Tomita laughed hysterically. ...ah, but sure'n there were giants in those days...

      the longest vomit story....Bill, we all will hail hail to your battle cry. This is a little ditty about Final curtain getting banned from the Down Home while most of it's members were having a quiet beer at Quarterbacks. A couple of qualifiers first, tho..... Whoever came up with the idea of soaking sheets of paper in psychotronics was a genius. What better way to control a group of people that can change the world then by giving them the opportunity to  to do it from inside themselves. Bruce  and i were indulging in certain pleasures and somehow wound up at Down Home as the nightmares were playing. The above noted pleasures involved some kind of barbs for Bruce, a coupla pieces of paper for me and lot's of Tequila....I remember lot's of Tequila. At any rate, Brian and the boys played one of their token KISS songs and we all got up and started dancing. Bruce made the mistake of bouncing into some redneck's chair. Bubba got up and promptly smashed his budweiser bottle on Bruce's head. No "hey there, asshole" or any thing - just glass splattering and bruce unconscious on the dance floor I, in one of my rare instances of angst, took exception to this redneck clocking my friend with a beer bottle. Bad form whoever you were. As I tried to gather Bruce's bleeding cranium from the dance floor, who should appear? Phil , by god, Leonard. I tried to explain to him, rationally, what had occured, but as I was the guitar player for Final Curtain, he had nothing to do but decide it was my fault. I picked Bruce up and got him walking - not coherent but mobile - then Phil , by god, Leonard decided that we were a blemish on the face of the Down Home and asked us to leave. For those of you who didn't know me back then, I was a little edgy...easily pissed off. I tried to reason with Phil , by god, Leonard and explain what had happened and he decided that the best course of action was to touch me. Remember, my brothers and sisters, I was edgy and not happy about being here, so I threw him against the rail that seperated the booths from the tables. I then collected the gelatinous Honeycuttand we proceeded to QB's to let the rest of the band know that we had been officially kicked out of the Down Home.  End part one.....Don't worry, Bill. There will be vomit in this story eventually

      Hmmm, a vomit story from former Final Curtain members you say. Dang, Bill where do i begin. I fondly remember all the times growing up waking up at your house, covered in vomit  (now that I think of it I hope it was my own vomit) too scared to  open my eyes because i had absolutly  no idea where i was or how i got there.  Geez Bill how much dried vomit do you think was inside the passenger door on the old Valiant? And Roland dont feel you are the only one who never made it in the house but i did have a pillow of hamburgers and a 6 pack of Moosehead to keep me company wlile I slept in the back yard. Amd one of my favorite puke stories was when i was married to  my first wife. It was a New years party i think...well any way. I think Bill was there. I remember we were at friend of ours , who by the way looked like Andy Summers.  I was sitting at the kitchen table drinking beer out of a friut jar eating an apple when all the beer and fiber from the apple melded in to something sick and wrong and it wanted out of my innards. I stood up and headed for the restroom but i was too slow, and the whole mess erupted from every orifice in my head. I slipped on the vomit and fell to the floor covered in my own filth, writhing around like a beached walrus. Let this be a lesson kids Just say no to drugs and alcohol. Thats all for now folks.

      Plez here.  Bobby: glad to hear the marriage is still going strong. We enjoyed playing your wedding party at Makato's. We drank for free, ate shrimp, flirted with the teenage cousins in the crowd, and got paid. And we got the pleasure of seeing your combimed families try to understand how in the heck these guys could be considered a wedding band. Doing the hokey pokey with you and Donna and your two families: that was interesting. We had to do something to make 'em all quit giving us the finger.  I have a good heckler story to tell, but it's about a show in Alabama a few years after the old Johnson City scene sort of blew up. Anyway, I used to play at this tiny little crudhole bar called Gentilly Station in Auburn. It was a good place because it was definitely for the few locals in that town, not for the students at all. So anyway, I used to play there either just by myself ("Hey, you know any David Allan Coe?") or with a woman who played the keyboard. It was not exactly the kind of gig that would advance your career. It was the kind of gig where people would ask me to do Jimmy Buffet, and I'd just play whatever little bit I could half remember from "Margaritaville" or whatever, and that'd be good enough for a free shot of Jack from some appreciative Alabama farmhand. So anyway, one night, the keyboard player and I decided to just see how much they were listening and--I remember this very clearly now--after we finished a Clint Black song, we played the Bert Bacharach hit "This Guy's in Love With You." You all remember that one, huh? Made famous by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass: "You see this guy. This guy's in love with you." Not what the crowd was expecting. About 4 bars into the vocal,  the inebriated woman sitting right in front of me stands up, about 1 inch from my face now, and starts this: "You suuuuuuuck! Quit plaaaaaaaaaying! You suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!"  No kidding around--I consider it one of my proudest moments on stage that we didn't stop until we played every note of that song. We took a break after that song, and her husband came over and bought me a beer. We played that song at EVERY Gentilly Station show after that, but it was never quite that good again.  Sadly, Gentilly Station closed for a while and the reopened as Bubba's. Last time I was in Auburn, I walked in there. It was exactly the same. I guess the name change was an attempt to reach their target market more effectively.   --Plez

      Those were Judas Priest lyrics by the way. should've chosen different ones, but I like condition and ammunition.   I was remembering a party at someone's apartment on Poplar Street, where a whole bunch of people started playing music with kitchen utensils--spoons, pots and pans. Martin and Donnie were there, I remember. It was an upstairs apartment in a house at the corner of Poplar and Buffalo.

      Another story from me...  Uncle Green was always a JC favorite.  Even though they were from Atlanta, they were like JC adopted sons.  Buck Fifty once opened for them at the Highlander.  Fast forward about two years, and I'm living in Murfreesboro finishing up my bachelor's degree.  Uncle Green was playing in nashville.  So, I trek down to see them.  I run into them standing outside the Exit/Inn, and before I can say anything, one of them says, "Buck Fifty man!"   This blows me away, becuase unlike many other folks, I never got to know them in their many trips to JC.  So, we procede to have a nice conversation and I see them rock it out later.  Fast forward again, this time about 5 years.  In 1999 I arrived in Atlanta with a new job in a new city.  On my third day of work, I head over to the student center to help out with international orientation.  One of the campus tour guides is looking familiar to me, and I realized it was Pete, Uncle Green's drummer.  So, I wander over, still not 100 percent sure it's him, and ask "are you a drummer."  He recognizes me instantly. "Buck Fifty man!"  Spooky the memory those cats have.  I remember seeing them at the Pub once and they rocked out so hard, and we were all dancing like crazy (note for another story... when, why and how did the Twist become the official dance that JC folks did at rock shows?).  After they end, Drew, Russ and I start rhythmically banging on beer bottles.  We end up doing this for about 5 minutes before they come back to play another song.  We all continue doing the Twist for another 15 minutes or so.

      If you take what Bill said prima facia - what he said about my Rickenbacker is true. But what he has overlooked was that he had borrowed my bass, sold it, and   then  he told me about it and finally paid me - but I had to break my legs first to convince him to pay up (okay, I was new at this kinda thing and I got some of the instructions wrong!)

      Whoa nelly, let me rise to my defense re: the thievery of said Rickenbacker,,Dave sold it to me for $150 when he had gotten a newer one. Along with the bass he sold me my trusty Fender Super Reverb amp. I still have the amp, although when I finally got around to retubeing it a few years back it promptly blew up....sounded killer for about 10 minutes before it's final gut wrenching demise. As Dave I am sure now recalls what irritated him about me selling it was that I bought it for $150, and sold it for $200 about a year later,,,,Ah the wonders of capitolism!!! (I am currently in the car business by the way...)  As to filling in the blanks on the Judas Priest Fan Club, I don't recall anyone of us admitting to liking Judas Priest, but I remember Donnie Poole, John Smith, Frank Spangler from University High, as well as Brian and the others from ETSU. In addition  there was a deaf girl who would lip read the conversations of people that stared at us (and given our garb and Rebbeca's purple hair that was a constant.) It was about this time that I learned that Frank, John and Donnie could play, and due to that knowledge I contacted Frank in 1984 to help put together the band (5 Neat Guys) that preformed the music at the Community Theatre production of Grease. This band would form the original core of Final Curtain,,,,and the rest as they say, is history!

      You know, it's my contention that the JC music thang go its start in 1983 or so. And not in the clubs and bars, but at a table in the lunch room at ETSU. And it was set into motion by a group of people that were loosely know as the "Judas Priest Fan Club." Not that any of us liked or even gave a shit about Judas Priest - It's just that by devine intervention this gaggle of individuals all happened to show up on the same day all sporting our leather jackets and someone mumbled as they walked past us "Well, looks like the Judas Priest Fan Club has showed up." Rather than being pissed at this derisive remark, we all just said "Okay, let's be that!" Now this group of musically adventursome folk included, but not limited to, Al Hobbs and Mike Mull (arguably the best fuckin' front man JC ever produced) Bill Edwards, Myself, Roland Tester, Rebecca Tanton, Karma and on occasion, Brian Nightmare. Now there were these others from University High that would come over and hang with us as we discussed and planned the JC musical landscape. Now these younger folk from the high school included Frank Spangler others that went on to become former Stinky Brothers. Al Hobbs and Mike Mull were already out there with their band, "Plain Truth." And all of the Judas Priest Fanclub folk were there at their first show, a game room whose name escapes me. But it was a GREAT show. Al and Mike were slammin and  freakin as the drummer and bass player just tried like hell to hang on. But Frankie and them other kids played that same show and had opened for Mike and Al, watching and learning. Just as they had been in the lunchroom at that table with the JPFC. Bill and I wrote songs and term papers for most anyone who dropped by, put bands together and plotted and planned - I would show the Plain Truth bass player new licks on the bass - some reason I packed my Rickenbacker 4001 everywhere then - and anyone else who needed to learn how to do something on bass. Bill was not a good guitar player then, but what he lacked in technique, he made up for in spirit and rubber lobsters. One thing about Bill - I loaned him my cherished Rick....and he SOLD it! Bill, if and when you drop by - help fill in the blanks for me.

      So, like, there was this one night somewhere along the 80's where Roland Tester and myself thought that it might be a good thing to link up with this "Folk Band" that played at the Soup Kitchen Annex for a demo tape they were about to make. Ended up sounding like Kieth Moon and John Entwhistle backing Peter, Paul and Mary - Hey, they put that 10 on the volume control for a reason damnit! And anyone that has ever heard Roland play knows that the beat is in HIS yard and he puts it any where he damn well pleases! But that's not the story - the story begins somewhere before the beginning. With us being invited to flesh out the very folkey "3 A.M." I believe it was Pat Taber (say hi to Chris Slaughter Pat) and her brother, whose name escapes me but he most likely was a Taber as well. There was Rick Phillips and Donna Leonard - Roland and I wanted Donna back then.  Sooooo being as that group was comprised of them "Artsy Mountain Folk" all their friends was "Artsy Mountian Folk" as well - Sooooo Donna has a wine and chesse party and wants us to meet their friends. Roland drank all the wine he could find and when that was no good - he went for the beer he had brought with him. Now throughout this little hoedown they were all taking turns, singing "Artsy Mountian Folk" songs and having a lovely time - I got handed a guitar and played a song of mine, "Bring me the head of Jerry Garcia" after which no one let me have a guitar again. Roland, God rest his soul, had been not only drinking, but eating cheese - lot's and lot's o' cheese. So after some convincing that we didn't really want to be there, we headed off on our way. But Roland is a LOT drunker and cheese laden than I thought. He does get home okay, but now faces that looooong walk from the car to his house as he throws up all the way - that boy was heaving like a champion! It all looks like some mob hit on Hickory Farms! But Rolands finds peace at last, but not in his house - it's in a big puddle of beer, wine and cheese out on the front lawn. And it rains during the night while Roland is left for dead on the front lawn until the sun comes up and his parents have to bring him in with the morning paper. And that is what begat the whole 80's music scene in JC - Roland sacrificed himself and sat the whole thing in motion. You heard it right here on the Booger.....oops, sorry, the Blogger

      I forgot two bands:  1. Top Ramen and the Noodles (or soemthing silly like that) with Mike Hilliard and Tad (late-era Nightmares drummer). 2. A pre-Gumption band also called Gumption with Mike Hilliard and two other folks in Middle Tennessee.  When Kurt and I moved to Chapel Hill to start a band we couldn't think of a good name.  So, we ripped me off.  The first Gumption was named after a mythical Tennessee city that my friend Mark created to symbolize all things redneck.  The first Gumption was sort of a hillbilly group, so the name seemed appropriate.  When Kurt and I took it on for our group, it didn't have any real meaning.  We just thought it sounded good.  Band names are silly. :)

      Bobby asked about my band history, so here goes:  Tall Tale (East Tennessee) Buck Fifty and the Longnecks (East Tennessee) proto-Floyd Eats Mayberry group with Kurt and Mike Hilliard (East Tennessee) Brother Watchdog (Middle Tennessee) Solid (Middle Tennessee) LMNOP (Middle Tennessee) Gumption (again with Kurt - this time in Chapel Hill) Earl Wells and the Gushers (Chapel Hill) The Cashmen (Atlanta)  And nothing for the past two years.  Sob... soon I'll be rocking again.  Durn master's degree.

      Wow.  Plez doing Like a Virgin brings to mind a strange story of seeing Plez at The Highlander.  I rode over with Gary (as I did so often then) and the show was as always stellar.  About 1:30 am, I turned to Gary and said, "I gotta get up and work in the morning, we'd better head out."  Just then, Plez started playing Like a Virgin and Gary said, "Hey, one more song and we'll go."  By the time the song was over, it was 2:20.  Plez had Like a Virgined for nearly an hour.  Sure he wandered around with it a bit and I'd guess that a good half of the songs he knew got mixed in with it but it was still nearly an hour of Like a Virgin.  I think this has to be some sort of record.  Just goes to show what a swashbuckler the ol' Plez was.  You never knew where he would end up, but it sure would be fun getting there.

      Hey Brook, thanks for the songs.  I remember hering this stuff at some point in time but had mostly forgotten it.  What I'd really like to accomplish though is to preserve even more of the music scene from that time.  My problem is that most of my tapes are just junk at this time.  Anybody want to come forward with tapes that they'd like digitized?  Maybe someone has some good stuff by Plane Jane or Steady Eddie?  I know someone has to have taken better care of their music collection than I did.

      Barb, Brook, very funny road trip story. We’ve all pulled the ol’ sleep at a rest stop deal a time or two I guess. I was thinking about mine and Donna’s wedding day, back in '96. Donna’s parents said they wanted a real wedding and actually gave us a big budget to do a big deal wedding. We had this thought of hiring Scott Pleasant and the Pleztones for our wedding party. I used to work at Makatos and they were agreeable to letting us use their bar area.   We had a pretty good crowd there, but a lot of people from out of town. Many of my immediate gang was scattered; Eddie was in Arizona, and I didn’t even know exactly where Gary and Chuck were, somehow couldn’t get a hold of Kim… but we figured everyone would love it: a real rock ‘n roll band. A lot of people did love it, but some seemed to grumble something along the lines of “where’s the DJ,” and stuff like that. A lot of Donna’s family had come in from St. Louis. I remember standing among them in my tux, well on my way to feeling half crazed, pumping my fist in the air yelling “grunt like a pig, grunt like a pig…Oink! Oink!” with the band. Then I peered around at everyone and I swear, I think I even saw fear in their eyes they were looking so disturbed.   The band was real troopers too. I saw many sidelong glances they cast at each other. Looked like they struggled in several areas that night. But, we were the wedding people and we were happy with hearing Pleztones. They had the whole crowd with ‘em a couple of times. Scott Pleasant’s version of Like a Virgin was a hit. Most ridiculously, they did the damn hokey pokey and everyone jumped in for that.  Finally, towards the end, Donna and I staggered on stage and attempted to sing “Oliver.” This prompted some family members to give us cash gifts earlier than planned if we would agree not to try and sing another song. Anyway, thanks Scott, Drew and James for the great show. We’re still married and everything, so I’m glad we had a big deal party with the Pleztones.   While I’m rambling about weddings, I have to say that Barb and Drew’s wedding was the coolest, most wonderful wedding I have attended. Thanks for inviting us to that. By the way, I will be at both shows, so look forward to seeing everyone.

      never dare a girl with a gas card! the very best thing about being young and stupid is spur-of-the-moment road trips.    that party was the only time i can remember ever buying a keg of beer and i think it might have my birthday or the end of school or both. i'm sure ann appreciated us leaving her there with a houseful of people, one of whom was josh morris' republican brother, who liked nothing better than engaging me in political fisticuffs. don't get me wrong, i'm sure josh's republican brother, whatever his name is, is/was a nice enough guy... but i remember thinking that at that moment, my happiness level would increase with the distance i could put between myself and him.     and i was right until we hit the possum. i was sure that was a baaaad sign. there was a pelt of grey fur on the towing ring on the front of the nissan for days it seems. it was stuck with a clear, crystalized substance. and i can attest to the fact that that was the world's largest possum. it was the size of a small, fat, furry child.     you forgot to mention we wound up in myrtle beach! during *bike week* what a freak show. we seemed so normal (swimming in our street clothes) in comparison. such great timing. we snuck into a campground to take showers -- might as well have been invisible amid the bikers.    do you remember martin luther king blvd in lumberton! the throngs of people all looking like they had walked off the set of Devil in a Blue Dress. the positively lynchian decay. granted, that might have been the drugs or the coffee or the angry spirt of the world's largest possum -- but something was cosmically askew in lumberton, NC. and for those guys to be watching Blue Velvet at that very moment, duuuude!    all in all, the most disturbing thing that whole weekend was johnny hicks hiding behind the door at the apartment when we finally got back sunday nite. i have never been so yanked on caffeine. he scared the shit out of me. i was confused. tripping on coffee. i thought i might punch him, but went to bed instead.

      Hello! Wow, so many ‘new’ people! Groovy! Bobby Swanay!-- Alive and well -- Drew and I both have wondered many times “What’s going on in Bobby’s life?” Actually, we say that about most of the people on this blog- but Bobby’s name took me by surprise most recently! I hope I get to see everyone in just a few short weeks. The closest thing to a class reunion I’ll EVER be a part of!  Just in case it’s not been mentioned recently- The Pleztones are opening for the Nightmares- I think both nights. I was trying to remember if Kurt usually played with the Pleztones or just certain songs? Was it mainly Scott, Drew & James? I could ask Drew but it only comes to mind when he’s not around.  This is a story that came to mind the other day- and it has nothing to do with the music scene. It’s a story about being young: There was very large party going at our(me, Ann, Brook) apartment on Poplar Street. This must have been 1986? It was late & Brook and I had ingested way too much of everything. We were blabbing about how we were going  to drive to Fla and see the ocean. Bruce said “Yeah right, there’s no way” So Brook and I got in her car and headed east. We drove in parts of NC, SC, and GA that night (and not in appropriate order)  Early in the trip we hit the world’s biggest opossum- it must have weighed 80 lbs!  At some point we decided not to go to Florida so we headed north. After some sleep at a rest area (and removing bits of opossum hide from the car grill) we woke to the sights and sounds of Bike Week. Peeking out the window to see what the racket was and seeing a happy couple on their coffin shaped 3 wheeled bike- we decided to head MORE north. We ended up in Lumberton, NC and decided it had to be the anus of the earth. We called Mike & Lynne’s to let people know we were alive and everyone was over at their house watching Blue Velvet, which takes place in Lumberton. Everybody agreed that it did seem like it could be the anus of the earth and with that Brook and I figured that our mission was complete and we headed home. We swam in the ocean at some point and ate at a Pizza Hut (?) I think that was the only time I’ve ever been in a Pizza Hut w/ Brook. That’s all.

      Why, You guys were a fun band. I sure got a major kick out of my high school buddies hitting the bar music scene in Johnson City. Ya know, I think it was Linda Barnette who drug me to the Down Home to see the Nightmares for the first time. Thanks Linda; someone tell her to jump on here and post something. Last year I came across an unlabeled tape and lo and behold, it was a grainy recording of a Tall Tale show. I think Eddie has a much better sounding tape. Hey Gary, before you go on in detail, what is the quick run through of your band history? Tall Tale, Buck Fifty, Floyd Eats Mayberry (or some variance of), Gumption, and then...?

      Stories, stories.  Let's see... where do I begin?  I think I'll begin in the fall of 1986.  There was a benefit show for the humane society, and Linda Barnett convinced several of our circle of friends (Elizabethton High folks, who stood out like sore thumbs in our thrasher magazine t-shirts and trenchcoats among the skoal-dipping populace of that school) to go see it.  Linda, you see, was already more wise to the ways of local rock than most of us.  So, off we go.  It was very cold that night, and I remember sitting both on and in a cardboard box trying to stay warm while the bands played.    I don't remember what other bands played that night.  But, I know the Nightmares were headlining, and that was something of a revelation.  There it was... good music that I could touch.  I could see those guys walking down the street.  I could see those guys pumping gas into their cars.  Very tangible.  Prior to this my only exposure to live music had been heavy metal concerts at Freedom Hall and Eddie Rabbit concerts at the state fair.  My friends Eddie Webb and Chuck Phaneuf played guitar and drums, respectively.  I'd been wanting a drum set for a while, but mom wasn't having it.  Eddie and Chuck set out to convince me that it was really a bass guitar that I needed to get that xmas, instead of drums.  This way, they reasoned, we could start a bad immediately.  And they were right.  I got a bass that year, and Eddie showed me how to tune it.  Only a day or two thereafter we started playing together.  Kim, who was Chuck's girlfriend at the time, was hanging around our little garage jams and became the vocalist.  I won't say "singer," since Kim, who I love dearly, never really sang much of anything.  Shouted, sure.  Delivered, fine.  Sang, maybe not.  But, there was something precious about four loopy high school kids doing poory executed black flag covers with a cute female singer, I suppose, because after one night at Down Home's ubiquitous Open Hoot, we landed our first "real gig" opening for the Nightmares at the Casbah (Club Venus at the time).  This was about three months after I got that bass for xmas.  I'm not sure many of the Nightmares fans from ETSU were really digging us.  But, it seemed like some of the more alternatively minded folks were at least amused, if not entertained.  So, we played around for a while.  Eventually we tried to replace Kim with Liz, and then I slid over and spent more time with Buck Fifty and the Longnecks.  But, I'll save the Buck Fifty stories for some other time and sign off for now.

      http://homepage.mac.com/brookhines/music/FileSharing6.html   Okay, here's some mp3s from the very first Nightmares recording in 1985 at Robert Blevins' studio. I promised Andy boy, but I couldn't find my AB CD.   This session is ground zero Brian and the Howling Tomcats stuff with Donnie Poole on drums, and very few original songs. I love "Money." It's still one of my all-time favorite covers. You should find Money, Pipeline and Jonesborough Woman. I found this CD in a stack of software and I'm probably going to get in trouble for posting these cuts, so go get while you can... :)

      :)... i've been in nashville too long.    i have this conversation quite a bit about what is the right way to share and use music., especially of people you know. not that i think anyone from the JC scene would haul you into court over an mp3  -- nor will you burn in hell for trading songs with folks. just wouldn't want to piss anyone off.    robert blevins made us an anthology of plez material. he gave it to us years ago. it's almost always in the car. i've listened to it as much as anything else (liz phair, minutemen). great car music. but i have always felt a little guilty for having it since it didn't come from scott. scott, i owe you ten bucks. get it from robert.  :)   if anyone wants any old andy boy songs i can post some mp3s on my ftp thingy.

      The main reson I'm doing it is to save some memories and preserve the great music.  My big problem is that almost all of my tapes from then are degraded to the point that they're nearly worthless.  I was hoping that as a community we could find the best recordings among us to preserve.  I'm certainly not looking to make any money from this and I have no intentions of infringing on the artistry of the music.  Frankly, I never really saw any troubles with the artists because the bands we're talking about are for the most part defunct.  Morally, I certainly don't feel like it's stealing or anythings since we all supported these bands by buying their tapes and going to their shows and even in some instances being their friends.

       urlLink   david -- we've been digitizing old nightmares and andyboy stuff for exactly the same reason. my thought is that there is no reason not to, especially since the tape is going to oxidize and you'll lose the stuff forever if you don't preserve it now.   it's important, if you want to share mp3s of stuff you didn't write, to let the artist know you want to do something like this. as long as you aren't selling the material, it isn't illegal -- and as long as you have permission, it isn't immoral.  btw -- a nightmares anthology is rumored to be in the works that will contain the best of the best studio recordings (released and unreleased).

      I'd certainly try it, David. This is from the standpoint of a non-technician musically speaking. There's value in those things beyond sound quality, as an aid to memory for instance. And it's a point well taken that they'll degrade further over time. My thought is sort of, it's a question not of why do it but why not.

      Along the lines of preserving pieces of that era, I've been piddling around with moving some of the old music onto more durable (digital) media.  It's not really a perfect system and the results are only as good as the old trashed demo tapes and stuff that I've got.  The point is that once I've managed to get them on a CD, the sound quality won't degrade any.  What I'd like to know, does anyone have any decent recordings from that time period that they think would be worth preserving this way?.  Most of my tapes are not only old, they've had pretty rough lives as well so aren't really good candidates for this.  Does anyone have any opinion as to whether this is a good idea or just hopeless?

      In defense of myself, I hafta say that I'm really not as serious as I come across here. Well, I am serious, but I also know how to laugh and take a joke, and I sure as hell didn't spend all my time in Chicago reading my bible. I saw a LOT of great music, art, and plays, and there was a cool music scene I was also a part of there. Got to see U2 at a teeney place called the Aragon Ballroom on their War tour. Held onto both of Bono's feet (this is the truth) while he sang "40". Also saw the Replacements in their heyday. paul westerberg threw a pitcher of beer in my face. Also saw Bruce Coburn at the Vic (he’s a favorite of mine), Elvis Costello, others. Had dinner with Big Dipper, a small band in the city, before they played once. And a good friend of mine, Tammy, was serious friends with Cynthia Plastercaster, who casted the cocks of many a famous rock star. Tammy and I went to college together, and at one point she and her boyfriend were found handcuffed, naked, and attached to a refrigerator in the billy graham center. And they didn’t banish her. had she been handcuffed with another woman, though, they probably would’ve.And David your art is absolutely gorgeous, and intense.

      Hey Brook, I had heard a similar story about Burt but always figured it sounded too much like something someone made up to be anything but true.  Speaking of Burt, how many times did we hear him sing "Johnny B. Goot"?    Marty Hyder made a flyer for some show that had a drawing of Burt's head wearing a chef's hat with "Johnny B. Goot" on it.  Burt asked him what it meant.  We all had a good laugh over that one.

      David: sorry. really. it's actually words to a song by the floating men, a band. I don't know what they mean  at all. they're very cryptic which makes them not poisonous to me. guess you understand them better than i do. i was just asking my friend who typed them (he said he wanted to make a contribution), Tom, what they mean, and he doesn't know either. i think they're about feeling o.k. with  yourself no matter what's going on around you. but i could be wrong, and if they offended you, then i'm definitely wrong. and rick milhorn: sorry if my comment about the pic offended. have never met you either. it was actually a cute picture and the beard is very sean connery-esque.

      Brian! Good to hear form you. If I were in the TriCities again you think I wouldn't have looked you up by now? I'd have my own band again. Living in Bell (oh GOD!) Buckle now, and doing that voodoo I do so well - Got tired of being Master of the Funkwrench in Nashville so I do my thing here in this little 'burg. I'm doing my art thing and by the way, I did a painting of Rebecca from one of the old pics I did of her - Slammin! Wanna see? No one else look -  SkinThief@peoplepc.com.   Write me! Or join our MSN sessions this evening with Rick, Bill, James and anyone brave enough to ask in! To Brooke; Of course we have a water-like substance here, but it moves a bit more slowly in winter. And of burning something; yeah we  could  build something, but why do that when we've got whole square of shops selling cheesy and contrived folk-art crap that will go like a tenderbox!

      I applaud Bill Edwards for being a gun owner, teaching gun safety, and not falling into the tired old trap of having to define himself as a conservative or NRA guy. Guns are still a problem in this country and it does need to be talked about. Hope everyone doesn't get so involved compensating for their manhood with their guns that they can't even have a reasonable dialog about it.   Here's my fundamental problem with the Iraq thing: how does this constitute "protecting our freedom" as we've heard so much? Is Iraq on the verge of overthrowing the US? I don't think so. This idea that we must have war in order to avoid war reminds me of the famous caption in one of my history books, where the general from vietnam is justifying that "we had to burn this village in order to save it." The evidence that Iraq is harboring terroists is flimsy at best. I heard Rummy last month say something to the effect that there's no time to wait for proof. Is Saddam likely to allow rogue terrorists into his country? If you were a terrorist, wouldn't Iraq be the last damn place on your list of countries to be?  As to the notion of fighting back, Al Qaeda attacked us, not Iraq. Is this transference? We can't get Osama, so we'll get these other guys instead. The terrorists are the major threat. There is no doubt they would use awful weapons against us. The fight against terrorism must be more than weapons and missiles and soldiers, however. This is very much a battle of the minds. The Iraq invasion will create more terrorists against us, and that is more dangerous than the poison gas stockpile itself. Dangerous weapons are available in nearly every country. Part of the effort against terrorism means defying their worst expectations of us and forming a real worldwide coalition dedicated to the principles of the sanctity of life.  Poison gas. If we’re so worried about him using it, what better way to guarantee it than storming the gates. Iraq knows good and well that one move like that and it is blown off the radar. Gone. Iraq has been deterred from using these weapons, but now we risk pushing them to use these weapons. By contrast, Al Qaeda terrorists are not deterrable in the classic sense and have much stronger connections to other countries, such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.  Yes, Saddam is a tyrant. Democracy would be better. But can we seriously go in, remove Saddam, and set up a government like our own for their people? Democracies must be for the people, by the people. I don’t see it as our place to form their governing system by military overthrow. It is for the Iraqi people to form their own democracy, and in that effort we should do whatever we can to help, but it is not for us to decide. What happened to “humble” foreign policy? So again, how does any of this relate to protecting our freedom? Why role the dice on Armageddon when there is no clear reason to do so? Clearly an Armageddon type of situation will likely result from reaping the whirlwind of terrorism. A unilateral invasion of a nation in the middle east fosters the climate of terrorism. We become “the man” keeping them down.   In the face of North Korea’s nuclear capabilities, some disturbing elements come to contrast. Iraq is oil-rich, and North Korea isn't. Saddam tried to kill poppy Bush and Kim Jong-il didn’t. North Korea is 6 months away from nuclear weapons and Iraq isn't. We need to do better than this. I’m praying to Rick’s dressed-up black Jesus right now that the majority of voters don’t vote for Bush in 2004. Oh yeah, I forgot, that doesn’t matter...

      Whew. Frank's letter was amazing. One of the worst things for me about growing up in a strict, religiously fundamentalist home (and i could go on and on here) was those weird comics, which I think is what you're talking about Chris (and I didn't know you went to Tri-Cities Christian) where people become demon possessed and all kinds of invasive "witnessing" goes on. The art is really terrifying and incredibly well done---disturbing. I would spend nights unable to sleep, worried demons would inhabit me when I was a kid. It was so incredibly unhealthy, and not only unChristian (those comics) but Satanic and inhumane. So much fear mongering from the religious right. Some people just don't get a metaphor, and, as a result, become inhabited by the very evil they preach against..

      Damn, Marcel Yoda is here. He should remember Joe Godsey, anyway, here's my two cents:  Well spoken Tad.  And as a side note, where is it written that gun owners must be conservative? I own guns, enjoy shooting them, believe in not only the second amendment but the rest of the constitution as well and have no trouble calling myself liberal. Heck, I have helped teach gun safety for the NRA, without actually being a member. Here's is something fun to do; point out to an NRA memeber that signing an NRA petition is a form of gun registration as it gives the government a list of gun owners...... it makes the paranoia grow like kudzu on a warm spring day..............

      Fellow bloggers,  It's been fun reading today's posts. I miss seeing all you guys.  I'd like to put a little (and I stress the word "little" here) historical perspective on a couple of the issues that have been raised. These are not statements of opinion. I'll get to those later.  I'll start with Brook's memory of a mild night at Melubro. It reminded me that the turn of many centuries has been accompanied by a sense of apocolysm, usually fermented by religious hardliners. Somehow, they got it in their timetable that each turn would mark cataclysmic events, which they hoped would bring them closer to the diety. Revivalist sentiment was always strong for the years proceeding each '00 -- conservatives worked to control the social agendas, and many blind souls were made to see. All the better to weight down the collection plates. And of course, nothing truly Apocolyptic ever happened (in the Biblical sense, anyway).  We were all fortunate enough to grow up in the late 20th century, where the rapid rise of technology met squarely the predictible return of the revivalists -- and we got bonus points for the Millenium. From the world wars and the Holocaust to the cold war, we've been building toward something like a self-fulfilling prophecy. I think Brook's question about the dominant myth is appropriate, but the other possible factors she brought up are resonant as well. While the thought of an "Armageddon" may sound hopeless and ridiculous to many of us on the blog, such moments have been greatly desired by many others. Those on the religious right, trained for goosestep behind Republican administrations that have cowtowed to its fringe, believe George Bush is the right man for this era, and would not even consider his possible role as antichrist (I slipped into opinion mode there). People frustrated by the presidential election and those the administration chose to lead key departments (justice, defense) may fall into another category Brook mentioned, "maybe nothing matters and whatever Bush Jr. does, there ain't shit we can do about it." (Which reminds me, did any of you notice that for this State of the Union Address, John Ashcroft was the cabinet member squirreled away in a discreet location? If I were a praying man, I would have gotten down on my knees and begged that the Capital would not be attacked Tuesday night, because we really haven't seen shit).  I read Frank's letter with a lot of interest. A couple quick thoughts on it: First, the U.S. Patriot Act has a built-in sunset clause, and we should all keep an eye on that date (I can't remember it off the cuff) and plan to make sure our leaders do, as well. Constitutional crises have been around for every major American war since the Revolution. My personal choice for the hall of shame is the Japanese interment camps, though on second thought, the Trail of Tears was way fucked up, too. So far, the closest we've come to that since Sept. 11 is racial profiling of Muslim churches, a feat recently accomplished by the FBI. The Pentagon's attempt for passage of the Total Information Control bill(or something so-1984 like that), appears to be in trouble now, with bipartisan worries about its infringement on Americans' privacy. House Speaker Dennis Hastert himself has said he doubts it will survive. Good for him. That's not to say that Justice won't try an end-around.  Frank also made interesting points about how the administration has discouraged dissent. The good news on that is that Bush used it during the midterm elections to fight Democratic candidates who had sided with him on both international and domestic issues. The general election survivors are now pissed, realizing they were had by Karl Rove and the boys. Seeing that they still have enough votes to not only prevent 60-40 passage of key Bush legislation, but also override vetos, they are acting as though they have balls, vowing not to play with Georgie any more. And with primaries in sight, potential Democratic candidates appear willing to break step with the predominant rhetoric and hit Bush in what is for now his weakest spot, international affairs. This is a president who for years has prided himself on tackling one issue at a time, and now he is faced with at least five that should resonate in the campaigns. It will be interesting to see how he handles them.  But all that is down the road. Now we have Dubya increasingly talking loud  and  carrying the big stick. In one sense, there is good reason for it. America's traditionally opportunistic approach to foreign policy in the last century created many enemies who at last found a charismatic and financially able leader in Osama bin Ladin. (By the way, whatever happened to that guy?) Our coddling of Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war also helped create and feed a beast. Unfortunately, I don't think there is any doubt that he is dangerous to us. Now the question becomes, how do we deal with the mess we've made? What we have done for a decade now is remain basically at war with Iraq, patrolling the no-fly zones and engaging Iraqi aircraft and land stations on a regular basis. This guy wouldn't dare go beyond his borders at this point. He knows it would be career suicide, and even he knows he's got a pretty good thing going for himself these days -- he's well protected by bodyguards, can fuck or kill anything he wants in his own borders, and makes money selling oil on the black market. The issue that Bush brought up the other night -- accusing Saddam of making nice with al-Qaeda, is frightening if true. So the game goes on -- rush in without international support, and the already troubled economy tanks further, more lives are lost, Israel takes at least a couple hits from ballistic missiles loaded with chemical weapons (Patriot missiles did not work the first time around), and extremists around the world find yet another reason to hate our fucking guts. Go in with international support -- and that's a bigger problem than the last time around, because the administration's unilateralist leanings have alienated us from just about everyone except Tony Blair -- and most of the downside still comes our way. Do we prefer our pancakes with elephant shit or donkey shit?  I don't really think we're looking at Armegeddon or anything close. But something wicked is definitely going to happen, and we'll never really know jack-shit about the people who will suffer the most. It is definitely time to reasses our diplomatic position with the big Middle-Eastern oil producers, particularly in Saudi Arabia, whose leaders have for years played the game of "pay off the Imams and let them run the schools and teach propaganda," in exchange for the shieks' security and continued financial dominance.  Let's all hope we can find some visionary leaders we can vote for, guys who don't screw the pooch so badly in the general election campaigns (sorry, Mr. Gore) that they leave themselves open to the kind of unbelievable monkey business that took place in Florida, or subject to having their potential voters taken away from them by unelectable third-party candidates.  Peace.

      Here's a relevant JC story... I forget the occasion, but there was a party at the old apartment at Meleubro. There was a bunch of people on the balcony -- Eric Youngquist, Sindy Byrd, Liz Turnbull, Lynn Youngquist, Paul Eckleman... too many to remember. It must have been 1988. It was a mild JC night, drinking Tequilla and cavorting over Roan Street, discussing all kinds of crazy stuff when someone asked if we thought we'd ever see Armageddon. To my utter surprise, most on the balcony answered in the affirmative. as in, we would be the generation that stood watch as is all went up in flames. only one of us had the excuse of a fundamentalist upbringing. the rest -- we just believed it. took it for granted, even.   so what gives? is this part of our collective psyche? do you fellow bloggers feel this way? is it bracing for the worst so anything less than Armageddon will seem like a life well-lived? or have we just absorbed the dominant myth to the point of embracing the thought of going out with a big bang? maybe every generation thinks they are the last in line. but doesn't that seem hopeless and ridiculous?   maybe our generation had a vision. maybe the intuition was right. maybe nothing matters and whatever Bush Jr. does, there ain't shit we can do about it. but, all things being equal -- isn't it better to be a thorn in the ass of Armageddon, rather than an accomplice?

      "Of course the people don't want war. But after all, it's the leaders of the country who determine the policy, and it's always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger." -- Herman Goering at the Nuremburg trials (http://www.snopes.com/quotes/goering.htm)

      War  is a terrible thing, but it is not the most terrible  of all.   The idea that nothing is worth fighting for is the worst of all.   The  goal of war is to ensure peace.  If we did not stand up and  fight for what we  believe in, then we would surely be overrun  and our freedoms would be taken  away.   There are genuinely  evil people in the world.  If these people are not  dealt with,  then they will take over.  They do not care about being nice,  keeping  peace, or what others think.  They take pleasure in seeing others  suffer.  If war is inevitable, people will die.   That happens  in war.  Iraqi's are currently being tortured and  killed for the simple reason  that they expressed their opinion.   This is one of our most treasured freedoms,  but we would not have  this freedom is we did not have the freedom to keep and  bear arms. However, if you feel the need to support Saddam's dictatorship,  then by all  means go ahead and protest against America, while  you still have the right  to.

      In response to the state of the union and war---a Methodist bishop in Nashville created an anti-war commercial with actress Janine Gerafolo (am spelling her name all wrong, but I think she's really cool). Anyhow, it'll only be aired in Washington and N.Y. darn. the 776th here in e-town has been deployed and leaves tomorrow---big parade at 8 a.m.

      To my surprise, The Pleztones’ set from December 27 was aired on Charter last night at 8:00 p.m. I guess now they will re-run the show at the same time as usual; Friday at 11:00 p.m. and Sunday at 2:00 p.m. I watched the first couple of songs while on break from class last night. Everything looked and sounded good. Donna watched most of it, between getting the kid ready for bed. She said something weird happened with the sound by the end, where the film and sound became off sync. I wonder if it will run that way again on Friday and Sunday or if it will be fixed.

      Chris, Thanks for the Tim Paretti photos. There's a guy who could make his bones picking in any American city, yet he chooses Abingdon, Va. What a twisted masochist, and an incredible musician and songwriter. It looks like those Tim photos might have come from a Clear show. Clear -- another band as yet unmentioned on the blog, also wiped their bee-hinds with the so-called auteurs of the so-called jam band scene. Right before them, Tim had the Electric String Band, with Dave Seay (!).  Those pics remind me of my favorite Tim Paretti story. He was one of my groomsmen, and as such supped with us at the rehearsal dinner. My then-3-year-old nephew, Dylan, got a look at Tim and began laughing pretty much non-stop until he just got too tired to make a laughing sound. My Dad told me later that he asked Dylan why he had laughed so hard at Tim, and Dylan said, "He has a tail!" Said tail would be the extry-long goatee you see dangling from Paretti's chin in the photos.

      I concur on the Shazam.   Best $5 spent thus far on music this year.   They got another $20 bucks out of me on CD purchases.   Listening to Godspeed The Shazam at the moment.  I thought they said Feb. 28th.  No date posted on their web site. Took some shots of the band...will post them (if any turned out OK).

      The 1991 horse head. I remember seeing that thing at Mike's apartment. It was dark out, and, yep, definitely a horse head. What the hell?   Love those pictures of Tim Peretti. What an anomaly he is. Saw him a couple weekends ago at a Darden Smith show at Down Home.   Went to see the Shazam and became bored. Couldn't hear the words. Sorry everyone. There was a real blonde guy/chick playing, and Tom and I kept debating if the human was male or female, but anyway he/she had a great haircut. I've decided to get my hair cut like that guy/chick this week---70's shag, lots of layers, Joan Jettish. I'll probably have to use lots of Bed Head to make it look right. Don't know why the band bored me. I'm so into compilations these days. I make a lot of tapes with a lot of stuff mixed together---lately Lauryn Hill, Greg Brown, Aimee Mann, J.J. Cale, World Party, Beastie Boys, Breeders, Buddy Guy. The same sound for too long just makes me want to sleep. Maybe I should have stuck it out longer.

       Tony, the letters were intended as an aid to those readers unable to express themselves due to shyness or illiteracy. If one wishes to write a heading that specifically includes New York Art Fags,  to the exclusion of Hillbilly Art Fags, Artsie Mountain Folk, and Transplanted Hillbilly Art Fags by way of Chicago, then of course that would be to writers discrestion.   As to my spelling of Skynyrd, I stand by the creative impulse that caused me to write in colloquialisms, much the same as Faulkner, Lee, or Twain.  Are you sure you are not upset that you were not named a hottie??

      I want to thank Scott Pleasent for his support on the all important “Lynyrd Skynyrd must be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame” issue. I have recently learned that Scott has been on the soap box about this issue for well over  a year now, long before I took up the flag. Due to his early support, and after consultation with Kurt and Julie,,,, well actual consultation on this did not take place you understand but I am pretty sure they would agree with me here,,,,,and due to Scott giving me a subscription to his fine E-Zine, the committee has decided to confer upon Scott Pleasent the title of “Hottie” and with it all the rights, benefits, and privileges thereof. Scott, you must always remember to use your power for good, not evil, as with great power goes great responsibility. (Also you should avoid contact with kryptonite, garlic, and the color yellow,,,,it’s all in the manual)  Now many of you may be saying to yourselves, “Gee Bill, I would love to help, but what can I, a poor hard working (insert profession here) do to make a difference?” Well, you could write a letter to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominating committee and demand that this oversight be corrected. Their address again is:  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation 1290 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10104    Not good with words? Feel free to cut and paste one of the following sample letters:  “Ladies and Gentlemen of the Committee  A grave oversight has taken place in the nomination process for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Surely it could not be the intention of the committee to overlook the contributions of Lynyrd Skynyrd. Based on the published criteria for inclusion, Lynyrd Skynyrd should have been inducted on first ballot. In addition to their voluminous sale of lp’s, their music has inspired two generations of southern musicians, and influenced so many of the leading performers of our time.  Further it should be noted that Lynyrd Skynyrd wrote and performed songs about racial harmony, gun control, and the harm of drug abuse, often against the grain of their times and fan base.”  or if you prefer a more direct approach you could cut and paste the following:  “Dear Ass Clowns and Art Fags.  What are you? Fucking stupid? I guess if a band has not never earned a living selling ass in Mannha,,,Manth,,,,Manhatt,,,,New fucking York, then they don’t belong in the rock and roll hall of fame. Well that is just fucking stupid. Lynard Skynard kicks the living shit out of all those new york art faggot bands. Heres a question for ya:   Q: Why did the southern man drive 800 miles to new york city?  A: Cause somebody needs thier ass kicked for not haveing Lynard Skynard in the fucking rock and roll hall of fame.”  Thank you all for your kind and prompt attention. I know that together we can make a difference!

      Eeewww, severed heads. True story. Mike Hilliard lived on the Old Jonesborough Highway, circa 1991. One day he said, "I need you to look at something in the back yard, and tell me if it is what I think it is." Just at the edge of the parking lot, in some weeds, was the head of a horse. It wasn't gross, nothing runny or bloody or partially eaten or mutilated, just kind of dry and shrivelled up and THERE. It was late fall, pretty cold, and the head wasn't breaking down very fast, but it was for-a-fact real.  Nobody could come up with ANY explanation, not even one involving aliens. Then one day it just disappeared. It was there for about a week after discovery, then just vanished. Lots of people saw it. We mulled over calling the authorities but never did. No one ever came around asking questions, so presumably nobody else called, either. So that leaves us with not only who put it there, but also who took it away.

      speaking of drummers -- we all have drummer stories, don't we?  my favorite drummer story of the moment is Mark Ryalls at the Library in Knoxville. he had a difficult evening, with his stool falling off the back of the way-too-small drum riser the good folks at the Library had recently built. toward the end of the nite -- after falling off the back of the riser for the last time -- he picked up his throne (stool, whatever) and threw it at full pissed-off-drummer-velocity into the audience. it's a wonder no one had to be rushed to the emergency room. it's a wonder they ever booked the nightmares again. god, i hated that place. every time i went there it seemed like some lite-beer-drinking-frat-boy wanting to start some shit with the fucked-up-hippie-chicks.   i'm trying to think of a good Tad Dickens story. Tad's more of a constant phenomena than a series of stories -- such an awesome drummer. The whole nightmares saga going from Mark to Tad as drummers, probably bears some reflection. the drummers had such a strong influence on the band, which i think really says something about the gestalt of what the nightmares were. neither drummer was better because they are both the fucking greatest... just so different. one metal and the other mathematical. both are such aggressive, stylistic musicians! such a joy to see perform.   the Deadbeats were a great band. i don't know if we've mentioned them in the Hall of Fame thread. they were post-Nightmares. Brian, John, Tad and the incredible Tim Paretti -- 1991, 92, 93, maybe. I have a video that Keith Smith shot of the Deadbeats at the Offshore Cafe that will peel your eyelids off.  "Shameless" is the word that comes to mind. this was the jam band from FUCKING hell. not any of that wimpyass phish jamming bullshit. these guys wanted your fucking attention and weren't going to stop until they got it. not if it took ALL NITE -- a 20 minute version of Orange Blossom Special -- "did i hear someone ask for a 20 minute rocket trip to bluesville? lets go!" you have to be heavily committed to the project to go 20 minutes on OBS. your audience has to be mighty forgiving for 20 minutes of OBS -- but there we were on that sweaty, beer soaked astroturf, hanging on every note. i am so ashamed, but better for it. what a great band!   never thought I'd say this, but i miss the Offshore! what a great club. that place had the best atmosphere. tiny, ambitious, in a very cool downtown spot. served great food and beer. i have nothing but great memories of the Offshore.   as i remember the Deadbeats played their final gig at Richard A's -- or whatever name it was operating under at the time (Legends? Fat Mo's Sports Palace?). and the audience was incredible! the place was packed with people who "got it" about this band and were there for the duration -- 20 minute Orange Blossom Specials and all. such love in the room!

      if you've never seen the Shazam, you are in for a real treat. i love everything about this band, but my very favorite part is Scott, the drummer. he has such great style. keith moon would nod (off) approvingly.

      Barbara, it was James Carville who made the crack about putting hollywood types in the coal mines at $6.30 an hour and see how they'd fare. Carville is interesting even when he's not speaking, because he looks like he could actually be a reptile.  It appears that CBS has put its new hillbillies thing on hold for now, due to a rural advocacy group out of West Virginia, the center for rural strategies, or something like that. The advocates put huge ads in the LA, Chicago and New York dailies, decrying what it said was the network's latest attempt to perpetuate the Appalachian stereotype. I'd just love to see what CBS would actually do with the thing, especially if it wound up using some crafty country people who "played the hillbilly" to fool the execs into hiring them for the show, then took it and ran in Beverly Hills.  When I lived in LA, there wasn't a day that passed in which I wasn't hit on for some spare change. I never passed through Beverly Hills without seeing some rags-clothed homeless guy parked on a bench next to a fabulous house. I would love to see a reality show in which greedy fuck Pat Robertson was placed in that situation. He could live in the carboard box city out by the train station, if gentrifiers haven't destroyed it by now. Better yet, I'd love to see the greedy fuck forced to participate in snake handling in northeast Alabama.  If ripping on Robertson sounds tired to any of you, I direct you to gregpalast.com. Palast is an American expatriate doing his work now for the British lefty press. Robertson gets more evil with each passing year. I watched the 700 Club the other night, and there he was, telling the faithful that their contributions could go to the far East, where it could get young women out of prostitution and buy them sewing machines and lessons. I can't decide which is worse, the whorehouse or the sweatshop. Robertson has made his decision, though. As he spoke, a photo of an attractive, hopeful-looking Asian woman flashed on the screen. But enough of that shit. OK, one more thing: Maybe he could be on a reality show in which he's a prison bitch at a high-security prison in Southern California. Trent Lott could be on that show too, and Jim Bakker could visit them to offer support and prayers. "We'll get through this with god's help," Bakker would tell them. "Just remember, when you lick the spoon, really lick it good. Get lots of saliva on there. Don't ask why. You'll thank me later." Ex-University of Mississippi cheerleader Lott would always have to wear a miniskirt for the rec yard ball games. Rah Rah!  I'd love to see a reality show in which Karl Rove attends university and gets an actual education, with his double-major and minors selected by the viewers. Then after graduation, the only job he can get is as a busboy, where he becomes addicted to cool-whip cans and is fired. He joins Robertson in either (and here's another online audience vote) the box city or prison.  I could do this all day, but I'd make you crazy.  Tad

      Can't take credit for "moon floss." Unless, er...well, I can't even remember ever seeing that. Was it really stringy toilet paper? I remember writing something I was terribly pleased with in the bathroom in the restaurant part of the Pub. I sacrified an entire scarlet lipstick to accomplish this, but what the hell it was is totally gone. Why do I have this little stump of a memory? Nobody answer that. I remember someone had written "Kurt Hagardorn is sexy as hell" in the bathroom at the Down Home and the "y" in "sexy" had that jr. high curly-que on it. I was miffed at Kurt (this was a LONG time ago, probably '86 or '87) because in an early morning hours food fight at Perkins he had flung cranberry sauce on my white shirt, so I wrote underneath, "More sexy than cranberry sauce." I don't know exactly how that satisfied my urge for retribution, but it did. It also involved my resentment of that "y" and the ball point pen it was written in. Just a polaroid moment for you.  Other mistaken graffiti identity: There was a bench on campus near the Sherrod Library, that around fall of '85 sported the messages "Respect individuality" and "ETSU is soooo standard." I had yet to meet Brook and ascribed this, tragically, to Gretchen...oops, last name gone now. She was in my sculpture class. I heard she got yanked from school for buying pot with a check and writing "drugs" in the memo line. My question is, who the fuck cashed that bad boy? And then there was the peace sign atop the smoke stack at the physical plant, courtesy of Rodney Webb. When they sand-blasted it off, he climbed back up and put a red square there. They couldn't figure that out, so they left it. It was really scary, he said, because the little iron pegs you climbed up there on weren't cemented in and you could pull them out quite easily just by getting the edge of your shoe hung on them.  He didn't discover this until he was so far up it was pointless to turn around. Well, I appreciated the effort. When Martin had that Peugeot he had masking tape on the rear window in the shape of a cross, with "Jesus" written on it one way and "Elvis" the other. I was walking down Pine Street when somebody hit Martin and the car in the intersection of Pine and Soutwest Ave. Martin was badly traumatized by the whole thing. I barely knew him at the time but I waited with him til the cops came 'cause I felt so bad for him. I knew they were going to try to give him shit because of the highly decorated and expressive nature of that car, and I just thought that was a damn shame. That may have been the first time I actually ever conversed with him.

      I'd like to see Trent Lott living in an L.A. ghetto working at McDonald's, while we're dreamin'. And Jerry Falwell trying to push his politics in one of those cowboy gay bars in Des Moines----and getting it up the ass instead. Oooh, don't get me started.  Man, there used to be great graffiti in the girls bathroom at Down home, but now, it's all so mundane and typical. though i did see something written above the toilet paper that read, "moon floss", and I thought, that had to be Lisa Williams who wrote that. but I could be wrong.

      RE the real beverly hillbillies -- i think there *could* be something interesting in the take on econimc class. i mean, people from the mountains are usually so unflappable in terms of getting stars in their eyes. it's one of my favorite east tenn qualities. but the first Beverly Hillbillies covered this pretty well and the nature of reality tv is to set people up to fail and then snicker at the fallout. i hope this doesn't happen. i hope that something sublime and beautiful comes from this study of mountain people, because the opportunity is certainly there. wouldn't it be more interesting to do a take on Survivor in which teams of Los Angeles movers and shakers come to East Tennessee and compete to survive on east tennessee wages, deprived of Starbucks and Neiman Marcus.

      On TV recently someone was talking to some West Virginia mountain 'types' about the possibility of this Beverly Hillbillies knock off show and one of them said "Screw that, I'd like to see 'em bring four of those Hollywood fat cats to West Virginia, stick 'em in a coal mine and see how well they survive"  Here's my idea for a Nashville based (turning the tables) reality show: Send 15 Nashvillians into a grocery store without their fucking cell phones and see how long it takes them to freak out from lack of loud useless personal announcements.  I am officially old and bitter (not necessarily in that order)

      Don't want to start a stampede, but I have located a tape source. Also, I have made a work-around for my VCR's problem, so I should have a copy after the show airs again Friday night. So I think you're covered, Kurtiss.

      Dunno, the joke sounds pretty old and tired to me. I feel certain the executives would have their own ideas about what "mountain values" are and want to show only those which underline their view of what's "funny" (read: stereotypical.) Maybe it's just me, but I don't see an opportunity here to subvert the dominant paradigm the rest of America has about us. Mainstream tv has such a narrow view of what's funny, and it's all about beating horses that have mostly been dead for decades. Rightly or wrongly, the belief seems to prevail that it's the lowest common denominator that counts with the advertisers, witness the programming that we have.  In a related incident, Plez and I were eating sushi at Cafe 1-Eleven not too long ago, and a taping was going on for some "hillbilly" "reality" show, featuring a toothless family in overalls, doing take after take of "spontaneous" reactions like,"Goddamn! Yew mean it ain't been cooked ATALL?" and other brilliant, witty, fresh from the farm observations. Once and for all, let me put the lie to this hype that these shows are not scripted or rehearsed. We saw it. At least until we turned our backs around to the cameras, so they couldn't have our gorgeous mugs for free background scenery.

      Hey Allan, Did you tape the Plez/Nightmare show on the TV?  We're supposed to get a copy from the cable company, but just in case I was wondering if someone taped it.  Snatches of Pink had a good album called "Send in the clowns".  It had a song I really liked called "Travis".  I saw them at the Highlander, with the rack tom/beer holder Gary mentioned.  I asked them to play Travis, and they pretty much couldn't get through it, they being so very, very, drunk.    If I was in JC Friday, I'd go see The Shazam.  They are he-men of rock that make me feel like a leetle girl in comparison.  Dirty, Dirty, Hippie.

      Did anyone else see the Brian & the Nightmares show on Homemade Jam (Comcast ch 13) last night?  My 3 year old son and I danced in the living room while we watched it.  It was a well produced hour long show (with only one commercial interruption!)  It included an interview with Brian interspersed between songs from the first set of the Friday 12/27/02 show.  They didn't edit out the between songs banter which I thought was cool.  According to their schedule, it will be repeated on Friday at 11pm and Sunday at 2pm.  Is this correct? What I mean is, do they repeat the Tuesday show on Friday and Sunday as well or is it going to be a different band playing on Friday and Sunday?

      Great story about Snatches' drummer, Sara Romweber (sister of Flat Duo Jets' Dexter Romweber)... When Snatches of Pink played the revitalized Pub Outback, I was up in one of the side balconies watching the show, and we (whomever I was with... maybe David Guffey?) realized that her drum set's rack tom had no top head on it.  But, it did have a bottom head, and she used that tom as a cooler of sorts, keeping her beer in it.  Anybody remember when the Pleztones and Buck Fifty played a halloween show at the relocated Quarterbacks and the Pleztones guys went in costume as Buck Fifty?  That was a hoot.

      There was a band called Curious George that played JC circa 1989.  They were from Kentucky, and played a sort of ska flavored type of bar rock.  I never saw 'em, but I heard some live tapes.  I'm willing to bet that many of you would agree that 63 Eyes was one of the most ass-kicking bands to visit JC, and I was wondering if anybody had a copy of their cassette only release "I"m not me but I play me on TV".  Mark Ryalls has a copy of "Look in for Mothmen", which is good, but this is much better.  I just have a demo tape with some songs from Mothmen.  I'd love to hear that tape.  I'm coming into Johnson City next Monday, the 27th.  I'm mixing a new song with Keith Smith.  So I'll be around for 3 or 4 days, at Ditty's house.

      I totally forgot Sex Police played Johnson City.  Of course, their drummer Jody later was the drummer for gumption (with Kurt and myself).  I actually still have a Sex Police T-shirt that glows in the dark.   I remember The Killbilly's, too, although I think there are a dozen bands with that name. :)  Thanks for posting those flyers/calendars, Chris.  Just seeing them brought back memories!

      Saturday we (Drew, Ann & Josh & I) were in a bar down the street here seeing The Shazam and Ann recognized this guy as being from 'Fun Girls from Mt.Pilot'- which is funny because I think they were all guys in drag- (he said No, there were only women in that band but later admitted to being in the band). Ann turned to me to see if I recognized him- I didn't- he looked like an EXTRA short Richard Marx- we mentioned something about Johnson City and he said that he had fond memories of JC- that he used to play there with 'Rednecks In Pain'.(add them to the list) Drew chimed in and realized they had played with Stinky Finger at some point and then the guy was talking about The Highlander. Such a small world.  Also: The Hellion Shoeshine Riders (James, Drew & Russ) I also remember the one-time only appearance at the Casbah of Three Fat Guys Smoking. quote from Drew - "3 Fat Guys Smoking was me, Danny, and Russ. Danny french inhaled, Russ blew a smoke ring, and I stuck a cig in my nose and inhaled, and exhaled through my mouth. Some mullet tried to sell us pot while we were onstage. How could I forget?"

      What's up, people?  I can't help but weigh in on the Skynerd thing, albeit a couple days late. I tried early Sunday morning, but it wouldn't take. Maybe the Southern Rock gods were intervening. Anyway ...  I love Skynerd. I probably ragged 'em as hard as anybody, but that's only because I had to play some of their songs hundreds of times in honky tonks and lounges. I'm over it now, and can once again listen to "Gimme Three Steps" without thinking of a certain nameless grandmother dancing around in circles, drooling and unaware she still existed in the Split Rail on the Bristol Highway, back when it was a 2-lane. Previous dissertations on this blog were outstanding, by the way.  One night in winter 1984, my underage ass was sitting on a drum stool in the Kingsport Ramada Inn when the guitar player, "Long Haired Country Boy" Jay Wood, staggered up, incredibly drunk off natural light and whiskey, and called out "Freebird." We had never played it before, but the rest of us were also drunk enough not to care, so it began. The drink had killed the Jay's hearing, so he slurred into the most out-of-key version imaginable. The steel slide against the neck of his SG revealed an utter lack of intonation, and his 50-watt Peavey was turned to 10. His voice, OK when he was sober, took on a pitch-poor whine that I was sure would shake Ronnie Van Zandt from his grave and draw him from Gainsboro all the way to Kingsport to deliver an ass-whupping from the beyond. But there are no such things as ghosts. I wasn't sure whether to laugh, pass out or protect myself with my crash cymbal. In the end, I decided to look at the 7 or 8 fuckers still left in the room -- three others had left by the time he went into the second verse. They watched and listened intently, seemingly unaware of the train wreck they were witnessing. It was 17 minutes of the most perverse, ear-grinding cacophony I've ever heard, if you don't count the Rude Street Peters, and it included every tweedly-tweedly-tweedly-tweedly etc. he could offer at the end, albeit about a half-step flat except for the couple times he seemed to sway to his right and actually hit a correct note.  When it was over, he put on his burgundy Member's Only jacket, stumbled outside to his Maverick, and drove off into the moonlight, the perfect coda to a night of song and frolic.  A couple of quick notes before I go. First, to Brook: Cameron Crowe is not the devil. I've seen Crowe's work, and if he were the devil, it would be much better. Second, to all who are wondering what this blog is, has been, will be: All of the proceeding are probably on target, but I see it as a good hangout, like the bars and houses where we used to meet back when we were all in Johnson City. Now we're spread out all over the place, with a few brave souls remaining in the tri, and this is about the best way to get that good old information and bullshit exchange without ringing up phone bills that force us to file for chapter 13. There are pictures, too. I like pictures.  Tad Dickens

      Well, I feel so comforted, though probably inappropriately, that serious dialogue has gone on on this blog that I wasn't involved in! After bearing my soul on this thing, I'm glad to see others express passion about stuff here so that I don’t feel so alone. I think that should be the purpose of this tool of expression, and I could philosophize on and on about that as others have. We aren't just memorializing, because there is no pure memorial, but also redefining stuff at the same time. I think that’s not only inevitable, but necessary. Personally, I have no desire whatsoever to return to 1989 and who I was then--a confused individual racked by insecurity. Though I still struggle, I actually now have moments of peace and clarity that are increasing all the time. And I’m SO glad.   What happened in the J.C. scene---all those bands emerging at once in a deadend town, was a testament to miracles that occur in the midst of entropy, but here I move into a philosphy of grace which is best kept in check.   So---Rick Milhorn--don’t quit blogging! And Scott---what’s this about waiting a month to blog again? What? Remember, when I first started posting here I threatened to quit due to “inevitable ‘misunderstandings’ that are often a natural part of human interaction”, but I’m still here because I trusted that I could be myself here and still have my boundaries about me. So no one leave. Emily Dickinson would be saddened.

      Vova Nova?  Did someone say Vova Nova?  Hadn't looked at the blog in a while, sorry. That was one cool band.  They gave me a 4 song demo tape that I've recently converted to digital.  I don't have any web space to post the MP3s for everyone but I'd be happy to e-mail 'em to anyone interested.

      Buncha hot chickens talking on a ferris wheel. That’s a classic. Gonna hold that in the memory banks for a while. I thought Plez’s words on what it means to memorialize a past “scene” were very thoughtful and well said; couldn’t possibly add anything to that. I was just listening to some Plez. 1973 is one of my current favorite songs of his. I may be affected since my kid is going on 6 years old. For those who haven’t heard it, 1973 is a nostalgic song about being 6 years old again. Makes me think; what was I doing when I was 6? Carter was elected President, I was moving around from place to place a lot. Totally clueless; I was a coke-bottled-glasses wearing brick-head (and I ain’t no rocket scientist now).  I can barely remember anything though. One of my few memories from then was a time in 1st grade when I raised my hand and asked to go to the bathroom. Instead of going to the bathroom, I just walked out of the school and headed down the road. Miles later, a stranger picked me up way down a country road and eventually figured out how to contact my folks. Mostly though, my clearest memories begin at college, I only vaguely remember being in high school, except for all the skateboarding.  Anyway, I ran across a funny comment about Jimi Hendrix. This came from cartoonist Peter Bagge who wrote an essay about the EMP (Experience the Music Project) rock museum in Seattle. I remembered this article amid reading the recent posts of memorializing scenes and rock hall of fame and stuff. While Bagge was generally favorable about the project, here is his general comment about Hendrix: “I hate Jimi Hendrix. Not that I disagree with his fans' claims of his originality, imagination, performing skills, etc., all of which I readily acknowledge. But the guy sang like he had a mouth full of marbles, and his whole hippie-dippie VooDoo Love God sexual persona always made me cringe, it's so embarrassing.” Pretty funny I thought. The whole article is available along with some funny cartoons at http://www.suck.com/daily/2000/08/25/index.html  By the way, that last picture Rick posted of himself was a little over the top….

       Let's not forget that "Almost Famous" is the second script based on the early carreer of Cameron Crowe. The first was... (Drum roll goes here)  ......... "Fast Times At Ridgemont High," which by the way was first a piece of crap as a book. I read it while working at the bar in 1982 at South West Depot, which was later to be called Richard A's.   Few of us remember South West Depot, but it is where I first met Bruce, Brian, Ralph Dosser, and I beleive T. Cecil. Beer was $1.25 a pitcher at happy hour, which would have been a bargain had the beer not been Falstaff (unless something else was cheaper by the keg.)   Kudos to Rick for exposing the softer side of the arab world........  Kurt, have you considered switching your cat's food to a more pleasing scent,, or getting that pussy off of your face?  Come back Plez, Come back......... She didn't mean it, she didn't know what she was saying..... Come back Plez.......

      I certainly didn't mean to crack the whip on the Plez. Keep that piehole wide open. Blog loves piehole.  When I came to JC all there was to do, was play pinball at Quarterbacks, and drink "free beer" at the Italian Pizza Pub (whose main attraction was a wide screen TV with a poster of a kitten taped to it).   Then Open Hoot started getting bands. We didn't care if they were good or not -- they were BANDS! Within a year, many of those bands became pretty good, and a market developed for music. The scene.  I guess when I heard "the scene is dead," from one of my all-time favorite songwriters, I heard surrender. I hate surrender almost as much as I hate Cameron (John *used* to be my favorite Beatle) Crowe. It's irrational. Like my obsession with those chicken rotisseries in Krogers. I imagine that the baked chickens are chatting, riding on their hot little ferris wheel. I'm completely amused just thinking about it. Totally irrational.  Think I'll just sit here and think about those chickens for a while.

      Morning folks,  I like to think of myself (as I cant think of anyone else) as being every bit as edgy as I was back in the day. I now have the resources to impliment my plan for global domination. We all grew up, well most of us did anyway. Sure there were giants in "those days" but there are still some amongst us now. I don't want to be the guy that has to rely on past glory to live his life, I dont want to scream Goddamitt! I used to be somebody. I am somebody now and goddess willing I will continue to be somebody in the future because I have went forth and spred my seed and am now cultivating the next "scene " members with a reverence of the past and a willingness to try new things now that we're past that pok'emon thing. Or i could just be talking out my ass........

      Things do change with the tellin', but you have to keep grape juice bottled up for awhile to make wine. Tee hee. Does wine violate the spirit of the grape, or represent it in a more potent form? Arrrrrrrrg. Couple of points: I for one wasn't making any statements about museum-worthiness, I was just trying to fucking REMEMBER, period. Nonetheless, I do see the similarity in that we are collecting stuff primarily from another era, one that has to be dead or else it would still be the same era as now. I think we do all have the sense that something's gone, and we can say THAT without saying that nothing now is interesting or that today's a complete void. More interesting, though, is the question of whether or not our 20something selves would've seen this endevour as silly. I'm inclined to say that yes indeed, we might have skittered away from it claiming something like inherent goofiness in the project. We might have blogged about something, but not about ourselves. I think as a whole we were extremely documentation-phobic, which is why there's a need to put the blog to its current (obstensible but forgiving) purpose. I see that phobia as really a kind of self-consciousness, the exact kind of inability to take ourselves seriously enough to feel like all this stuff is worth documenting that I was talking about in the my very first post. I see that rearing its head still in a tiny way here; I just think that's an interesting finding. Almost a determination to seek self-effacement, in stark opposition to the All-American quest for noise and lights and un-earned kudos and big paychecks and 15 mins. of the f-word.

      What?? "Everyone in JC simultaneously climaxed in 1988" ???? Why do I never get invited to parties like that??? Seriously Brook, why did you have to go and silence Plez? He was one of my most vocal supporters in my fight to bring justice to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and I face an up hill battle in this most noble quest. And to think we were going to promote him to Hottie status.......

      Well, I didn't mean it like THAT, honestly. I didn't think of how that all might sound to our co-publishers Lisa and Brook. And in life in general, I think none of us has peaked at all. If I really thought I'd live the best of my LIFE already, I would feel pretty cheated. It's just that the scene thing that we're supposed to tell stories about is pretty much over and that telling stories about it here is pretty much like telling any story about anything anywhere. The telling of it tends to change what the thing was. Allan seemed to be saying that really a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is a stupid thing to have because it's not really the best people who played the music anyway and because it sort of violates the spirit of rock anyway. And my point is that ANY kind of remembrance thing of any type violates the spirit of the thing you're remembering. Changes it anyway. It's just inevitable. So my point was that a RNR Hall of Fame is no dumber than our informal JC Hall of Fame here, which I find NOT dumb in the least. I find it the very essence of being human, to want to record and memorialize things. And that's one of the best things about people. We work really hard sometimes to keep good things alive. And, yeah, I didn't really like Almost Famous, either. That was just an example, and probably not such a good one.   Once again: most of us are neither dead nor irrelevant as individuals. Our little "scene" is dead. That's what I was getting at. I didn't write that very carefully this morning. Methinks the Blog is definitely doing its good work. Most definitely. Ok, I promised earlier to be quiet for a month. See you mid February, fellow JC Bloggers. In the meantime, write some good stories!

      gee Scott, you make it sound like everyone in JC simultaneously climaxed in 1988, and now we are all sitting back enjoying a cig before we lower ourselves into our coffin.  I'm not offended by anything you wrote, I agree that our days of youth are gonedaddygone, but I do think you're reading too much "purpose" into the blog.   Blog has no purpose. It is a blank sheet of paper made possible because of a group of renegade software developers (Pyra). I remember being 19 and 20 wanting more than anything to be able to publish something people would read and want to participate in. Could we have published something easily -- so inclusive -- so CHEAP, in 1988? Hell no! We can share stories and yak all nite long, because of people full of piss and vinegar created Blogger. History books tell the "history" of the committees who pay for them. We can tell any history we want. I think it's pretty damn revolutionary and that's something I would have approved of very much as a 19-year-old.    and YES, the music industry "regulates" the rock out of rock -- always has, always will. The music industry could care fucking less about the music. But, until Ashcroft says otherwise, it's still up to people to decide for themselves what interests them musically. If it's Ethnic Hillbilly Garage Rock, or Happy Valley Power Pop, or Lo-Fi Singer/Songwriter concept albums, then the market can either recognize that or not. Their loss if they don't. Bloggers who have shared their thoughts about these bands shouldn't feel they are any more pathetically living in the past than anyone who has ever discussed Bach or Miles Davis at a cocktail party. No one ever says, "sure that Bach was a great composer, but what is he doing now?"   So, don't be so hard on the scene, man. :)  as an aside... the only reason we have movies like Almost Famous, is that no one had the balls to tell Cameron Crowe to take his big talentless ass on a long fucking vacation and quit stinking up the multi-plex with his insufferable whining. He's the fucking devil.

      Good point, Allan, on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I mean, it's a bogus idea to begin with, of course. Rock and roll should resist that kind of enshrinement. But since it's there, I mean, c'mon, how can Skynyrd not be in it? I think a lot of the Johnson City bands were better than or at least as good as a lot of the stuff that might be enshrined there. But part of a hall of fame is that it's a hall of FAME, not necessarily a hall of GREATNESS. Let's think of Emily Dickinson, who published only 6 or 7 poems in her life. Right after she died, no one would've had any reason to put her in any poetry hall of fame--because she wasn't famous. But now she is, and no one would keep her out of a poetry hall of fame, were one ever to be built.  Halls of fame are for dead people and for people who are no longer really relevant but still alive. That, no offense, is the whole purpose of the Blog, as I see it: to keep alive in our memories something that's basically dead. Something is memorialized. Of course, it also changes in the process of being memorialized. But that's ok, too. We all know that the historical markers at battlefields don't really tell the TRUTH. Rock and roll itself is more or less dead. That's why we have movies like Almost Famous and so forth that try to memorialize some little aspect of something that was unusual and great and worth remember. Sure, the music industry has regulated all the rock out of rock. There's no more renegade computer software developers, either. And the dot com revolution is over. And the hippie movement is over. And the civil rights push is dead. But the successors of all of those owe a great debt to the true originators. Thus, I went to see a Zeppelin cover act the other night that sounded so much like Zep that I'm sure they played it live better than Zep themselves ever did. And some people join the Society For Creative Anachronisms. And no matter how much you know it's gonna suck, you know you're gonna fork over 8 bucks for the next episode in the Star Wars series.  And the Johnson City music scene we all remember so fondly is over, too, even though music in this town still continues. But notice what people have been doing lately here? They've been basically coming up with a Hall of Fame, haven't they? All those lists of bands there were from here and played here at one time or another--what're those if not our own little Hall of Fame? If we were all still full of "piss and vinegar" (the old saying) as we were back then, we'd see no need for the Blog history. But now we do. I'm sure if any of us at age 19 or 20 could have time travelled and seen the Blog, we would say this whole thing was kinda silly.   But we don't say that now. So, yes, the RNR Hall of Fame is silly from the perspective of a real rock and roller. But that's not who it's for.   Also, no offense taken, but of course I knew the capital of Alabama. That was rhetorical.  Gosh, I'm one wordy guy. Forgive, fellow bloggers, and I promise to keep my mouth shut for a month now.  --Plez

      Plez,  Montgomery is the state capital of Alabama.  Without a doubt, Lynrd Skynrd deserve their props in the annals of Rock N' Rolldom.  If that is to be enshrined in a cheezy institution like the RnR museum, well so be it.  I find it ironic that RnR (and what EXACTLY defines RnR music?),  is/was a phenomenon embraced by disenfranchised youths across the country and the world, is now an establishment unto its self.  The RnR museum should change its name to The American Museum of Popular and Profitable Music Since the Latter Half of the 20th Century as Recognized by the Recording Industry and Dubious Music Critics.

      i once was in a planetarium and during a segue from Jupiter to Uranus (laugh now) some one yelled "FREEBIRD!"  During the milennium celebrations, a Louisville Public Radio station played the "Top 2000 songs from the 20th century" and put "Freebird" in at number 1 (as a joke according to the station manager) but the public outcry was insane. They had to go to all media outlets they could muster to defend it, but in an editorial, the station manager said something to the affect: people always yell for "FREEBIRD" and even if it is unintended, it is undeniable: it is omnipresent in our culture.  i have been to cleveland, three things i learned there: 1. Cleveland does not rock (since David Thomas left, anyway) 2. Drew Carey is not funny 3. the rock and roll hall of fame is the museum equivalent of rolling stone magazine (which has evolved into an abercrombie and fitch catalog with a "music and culture sensibility")

Just an aside, Skynrd was not even from Alabama, they were from Florida, so I think they were saying butt out to everyone who judges another.... But thanks for your support on this issue, you are truly a Johnson City treasure. Kurt and I will be meeting shortly to determine if we can elevate you to "Hottie" status!!

      Yo and hey, y'all:  Um, I can't let the Skynyrd discussion go by without adding my opinion. It is a JOKE that those guys aren't in the rock and roll hall of fame. I mean, that is a JOKE! And I have to add that I actually like Skynyrd. I don't like them DESPITE their crowd or EVEN THOUGH they've become nothing more than a tribute to themselves lately. I love those guys for exactly what they are, and I always have. On the subject of "Sweet Home Alabama," I must add that, having lived in Alabama for almost a decade, that song was requested at every show I ever did down there. No one ever asked for "Freebird," not once, in Alabama, but damn they sure love "Sweet Home" down there. In the beginning, I just played it because, well, that's the kind of gigs there were to play in Auburn and Waverly and Loachapoaka, Alabama. Play what they wanna hear, you know? And why not?  But after playing it a bunch and noticing what absolute joy the people took in that song, I started thinking about it more seriously. And, when you think about it, that song is like saying "I can talk about my mother, but you can't talk about my mother." And I think we can all understand why people feel THAT way, can't we? That verse about the Governor? It really says, "In Birmingham, they love the Governor." Well, Birmingham is not the capital of Alabama, is it? It doesn't represent all of Alabama, either. It's just the biggest city in the state. That's all. Birmingham was governed by a succession of famously racist pig mayors. They put MLK in jail for a night just for parading without a permit. The next line in the song is, "Now, we all did what we could do." My interpretation? The white moderates and white liberals might have disagreed with Gov. Wallace, sure enough, but that doesn't mean they could prevent his dumb ass from standing in the door of the U of A to prevent the first black student from entering the University. Next line? "Watergate does not bother me." I love that one. Nixon? A bloody idiot from California. True enough. Still, unlike Neill Young, I don't get all moral on you and write a song called "Western Man" to accuse everybody from the Left Coast of government corruption. I just say, "Daggone, that dang ol' Nixon was a daggone idjut, daggone." Last line of that verse? "Does your conscience bother you? Tell the truth!" Plez says, Skynyrd got it right there. No matter who you are, you've got things in your past you ain't all that proud of. No matter where you live, you share a history which includes some awful stuff. We all do. If your conscience isn't bothering you, by gosh it's because you ain't thinking hard enough.  So, come off it, Neill Young. I gotta say, the more I sang that song in Alabama, the more I sang it with outright conviction and purpose. I'm not gonna mention any names, but I had a friend up here in J.C. who came right flat out and said he would NEVER visit me in Auburn because it was in Alabama, and he counted it as a point of pride that he had never set foot in that Godawful backward medieval state. When even Tennesseans can get this kinda crud into their head, imagine how a Canuck (ha!) like Neill Young could be convinced that there are still roving lynch mobs in Alabama.   I think that's what they were saying. Basically: "Judge not what ye have not seen." And God bless Skynyrd for saying it. God bless Skynyrd in general. Forgive me for taking up this much space in Johnson City Stories to blabber on about something so unrelated to JC. But in a way, it is. I mean, think about it, when the GEORGIA SATELLITES, who themselves traded on their image as being form backwater Georgia, referred to us a JOHNSON STATION and said on MTV that we were the worst town they ever gigged in, we were all most righteously pissed. I was. I mean, I was a little.   I used to say I wasn't going to the RNR Hall of Fame until they put AC/DC in there. Well, AC/DC goes in this year. But I revise my ultimatum now: I AIN'T GOING TILL SKYNYRD GETS AN INVITE AND THAT'S FINAL!

      this is a great story from Tony Black. he emailed it to me for posting. without further adieu, Mr. Black...   query aimed at james arwood. should we tell the one about the night outside QB's part2, Paul Stanley(?) was playing a set of 60-70's covers inside the bar, we were standing outside shootingtheshitfantastic. You had been explaining to some VI coeds how it is that music played with a lefthanded guitar DOESNOT come out backwards AND, its not any more difficult to produce notes or chords. A tall and giacometti-slender young lady walked by and some chainsmoking rednecks cousins(not us) oogled her. Earl-cousin one said "she's so damn thin you could use her as a toothpick." Earl-cousin two laughed so hard his mouth opened and revealed, surprise, very few teeth with which to exorcise striations of cooked or raw flesh from between, for example. At which point we looked at each other and snickered our college-matriculating hilljack snickers. when suddenly paul stanley(what was his real name? who cares) appeared and was trying to get you into a fight (you were trying on your gandhi-as-hockey-goalie-face because you didnt want to lose you drinking and dart throwing privileges). i remember playing the UN peace broker role(maddie albright in frayed cords and flannel shirt). Standing between you two(not U2 or any cover bands) and saying "ignore him james, cause you'll go to jail and he will STILL look like paul stanley" at which point he lunged, or fainted? in your general direction. in a reflexive motion i picked him up by his neck and dropped him to the pavement? a crowd stirred, tie-dyed boys ran inside for back up. bouncers appeared and we heard a car door slam out on walnut street in a westerly direction. we all sighed in deep amusement as the slightly wounded(the back of his shirt had soaked up anonymous random spittle). Cool hair sensation rode off into the 2am smoggy glow of our humble burg, the the athensga of the middlin' appalachians. ?  we laughed so hard we vomited to satisfy bill edwards sick and twisted whims? thats when jack kerouac walked in and...thats all i got to say about that.?

      Interesting that downtown development would fall under the Industrial Development Board. Hopefully that reflects their desire to do something with all the empty industrial property down there and not the intention to lure industry to downtown. There's some choice buildings downtown and on Walnut Street. Places we are so used to seeing, we wouldn't think of them as having possibility for cool development. Nashville is trying to rehab a sad little part of town known as the Gulch. In fact, that's the "upscale" name they've given it,  urlLink The Gulch.   I'd like to see that property across from the downtown parking lot turned into loft housing and light commercial. That would open up the corridor and promote foot traffic from the tree streets.   I'd also focus on establishing bike paths and pedestrian-friendly walkways. JC is already a great place for runners -- why not capitalize on that by extending the known running routes into an official pedestrian corridor. Plant lots of laurel and rhododendrons. Install some lighting. Nothing fancy, just functional.  I'd draw a circle around the university, the tree streets, downtown and the new library. Call it something. The name Little Chicago certainly works for me as it suggests history and (egad) hipness, but names don't mean too much unless they come from the bottom up instead of from the top down. See above, The Gulch. It's a crappy name, but it's what it's always been known as the railroad gulch -- so it works. It doesn't have to be THAT descriptive either. The Garden District in New Orleans is a good example. What does Garden District mean? Nothing. It's not like there's any [public] gardens down there. Or Magazine -- what is that? The name of a street. You could call the area the Roan District. that's nice. Goes with Roan Mountain. Plant more laurel and rhododendrons. Viola!   The basic premise of New Urbanism is to preserve a mix of residential and commercial zoning (which you already have) while encouraging pedestrian traffic (which you need). I can see a twist on that would work for a mad little mountain town like JC. The equation would include the usual New Urban mix along with a dash of college-town (granola?) mountain lifestyle infrastructure like the bike paths and trolleys. Call it New Ruralism. I'd look to Asheville, Boulder, and Boone, N.C. for inspiration. Also, maybe Oxford, Ohio. JC is so small there is no reason why the south end of the city couldn't be cultivated into a healthy-outdoors-lifestyle kind of place. I think there's bonus points to be had by promoting mountain sports, arts and music as a tourist draw. I can totally imagine a getaway "vacation" package in JC that would include hiking, rafting, dining at Galloways, music shows at the Down Home and (build it and they will come) shopping in the downtown district. JC could have the mountain-based tourist destination that Pigeon Forge screwed up so freakin' bad. Sure there's nutcases who think a mountain getaway isn't complete without off-price shopping -- but there's just as many people who want to really see mountains, really hear mountain music and see real mountain arts and crafts.   A yearly festival would be a good thing too. Look at what JonesboroUGH did with storytelling for crying out loud. Johnson City could do a big yearly Blues Fest to go with the Little Chicago name. You'd HAVE to have beer sales outside -- so make the most of it and have only local brewers Rocky River, Highlander (Asheville) and whatever the Otter comes up with if they ever start brewing again. The local brewery thing also goes with the bootlegging history associated with Little Chicago. Damn, wouldn't it be fun to have a MOONSHINE FESTIVAL! How much fun would THAT be? Have that coincide with Race Week and you've got a hit! WOOOO hoooo!  Okay, now I'm just babbling.

      the johnson city , industrial dev athority is looking for a new exe dir ,, downtown seems to be their biggest concern ,,, so waht would you recomend doing to make downtown a better place ,, if thats not to much of a value statement .... I allways thought about apts filled with college students with a shuttle or rail car running back and forth from downtown and the campus ,of some kind like,,  the city had in days of old ,, when it was "little Chigao" ,, student housing on the second fl.is what a study said to help downtown,, in grundy va where they are moving the town out of flood plain ,, i guess get people there first ,, lit'l chicago inplies ,, gambleing ,, jazz , blues etc..clubs ... is that what we need ("here in no name city" -ie paint your wagon)students living over a bar ?  sounds good to me so .. far ....what would you guys and gals on here is what i would do or like to see done ,,, if un ... you or your drinking buddy  got the job as exe dir of down town jc economic environment ect development,,

      “We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun...” -not penned by Kurt Haggerdorn, thank god.  What you described Plez, pretty much is exactly how cbgb’s became CBGB’s. But that makes what you and Brook wrote about JC all that much more impressive. The invisible arm of christ in jc was hard to twist and impossible to tatoo(at least back then). To make space(with naive and blunted force) for “art” in that appalachian climate was incredible.   Think about  it, it’s never happened in Canada.  Who fell under the spell of the Industrial Music Complex? Well, the TV in Poor Richards, but thats about it. You were DIY when DIY wasn’t cool (or had a cable network).   “Love is a battlefield...” -Pat Benatar(sic)  To remember all the college-liberals-in-training singing along to “she’s a surfboard...” or “applebutter made in train”, arm in arm with their college-neo-conservatives-in-training, passing spliffs to the unbathed-future-nadar-voters-inutero. Knocking back pitchers of beer with future super walmart shoppers: throwing darts and throwing up with future homeowners and, dare I say it: parents. Who knew?  For perspective: does anyone think REM or U2 have gotten better in the last decade or two? Butthole Surfers imploded with corporate funding. Hell, Paul Westerburg is still alive and isn’t even governor of Minnesota. He is a parent, though. hmm.  “Starlight, starbright, first star I see tonight...” -Madonna  Has anyone brought up the night the jesusfreaks all came to a certain downtown parking lot to save souls? They were singing and praying about shutting down the devilworshippers bookstore and bring the wiccans to xmas. Close TAP, because, if they saved all the gays, there’d be no more “Aids” to be “Project-ed” in “Tri-Cities.” As for booze, Greyhound buses and Im-Morrel music, I don’t know what they were thinking.   The bookstore eventually was set afire and closed and most of the queers and needle-dopers died.  Buses and Morrels’ are still there and a tatoo place! so I’m not sure who won...  but for fucksake, somebody told me People actually live downtown now. imagine.  When I lived in chicago my bus stop was near a gentlemans club that I had to pass to get home. There was always two generic and interchangeable pie-faced young  “men” stationed outside at opposite ends of the building, about 4 yards from the bouncer doors(marked by velvet ropes).   The first young guy would say under his breath, without making eye contact, “Jesus loves you.” and when I went passed the main entrance and approached the other kid he would say, very quickly under his breath, “Godblessyou...”   They were certain they had intervened in my path. This reminded me of home.

      Nice comments from Ms. Hines on why the J.C. scene is so memorable and important to all of us, despite the fact that nothing much actually happened, if you think about it.   It's like this. One flower in the middle of a field of flowers? No big deal. But when you find one growing between the cracks on a busy sidewalk, you have to say, "Wow, those things find a way to live anywhere. Right on, my flower brother!" Or something like that.  Here's a J.C. story that relates. Stinky Finger had done their Down Home gigs and a few others, but they hadn't been around for very long. It was still more of a joke idea (well, it was always a joke, just a daggone good one) and not a REAL band yet. So, Mike and Lynne have some people visiting them from out of town, probably from Kansas, and they tell their friends about Stinky Finger and say they wish SF could play for them while they're here. This is at M&L's house. Anyway, figuring we'd just get no for an answer, we decide to go down to Burt at the Club Venus and ask him if Stinky Finger, Beat Yo' Mutha, Old Plez and maybe somebody else could play one night while they're here. There was no PA at the place. We said we'd rent or borrow a PA from somewhere if Burt said yes.   Well, not only did Burt say yes, he said "What about Wednesday AND Thursday?" (Or maybe it was Thursday and Friday--how can I be expected to remember, but it was two nights in a row.) Well, this just blew us away, the idea that to get a real gig, all you had to do was show up in a place and ask to play. This probably never occurs to most people who can play but never have. They imagine there's some sort of mysterious process to it all, when, if the scene is small enough, there is no process beyond just showing up and asking.  So, then, we go down to Morrell's and rent the worst Traynor PA setup you have ever heard. Puke and Ugly would've sounded better with police bullhorns, really. But we didn't care. I mean, we took that PA back to Morrell's the next day and didn't use it on the second night, and I don't remember what we did use, maybe an upgrade from Morrell's or maybe one borrowed from Franky Spangler. I can't remember.   What Brook was saying made me think of that because, in a city with a REAL music scene, you'd probably never be able to do that as easily. I mean, think about it--you don't just walk in to the Bluebird Cafe or CBGB's or wherever and say, "Can I play here tomorrow night?" You don't even walk into the Down Home or into your local sports bar that has classic rock cover bands on Saturday night and ask that. But you did with Burt, 'cause he didn't have a music club. He just had a space behind his pizza place that he wasn't using very much except to let people drink dollar pitchers of Meister Brau and was wondering if maybe these kids could help him to get it to make a little money.   And probably the best thing for us was that Burt didn't exactly have discriminating taste. It wasn't like he was sitting there and thinking, "Hmm. . . these boys are ok, but they really need to work on their stage presence and get tighter on the changes." No, he was just thinking, "I have 80 dollars in my hand, 50 of which goes to the band. Now, the band just drank 40 dollars worth of beer, and their 20 friends who came to watch them have ordered 4 large calzones and about 10 slices, and that table over there is on their 9th pitcher of Meister Brau. Let's see, that's about 100 bucks more than I was gonna pull in if we didn't have the band here. Ok, let's keep having bands, and for the moment, no high class deesco."   I lived in Auburn, Alabama for a long time, too, and it was much the same. There was no real music scene, no industry for it at all, just like 30 local people who divided into bands and played sometimes. In my entire "career" (ha!) as a player, I have gotten exactly ONE gig because I gave someone a tape or CD of my music and had them to check it out. The rest were exactly like those gigs for Mike and Lynne's visiting friends.   --Plez

      Here's something totally non-political that's been swishing around in my brain for a while. I followed Allen's link to the Stinky Finger site with the Psychic Sex Turnips on it and found Bruce Honeycutt's quote,  "...What is with this sudden rush of nostalgia for the way things used to be in Johnson freakin' City. Hello! Does anyone remember how we used to sit around watching cartoons doing bong hits whilst complaining we had nothing to do? This so called scene everyone and their grandmother is on about consisted of...what...three or four bands? At best? And of those bands, only Stinky and the Nightmares were really any good...and Plane Jane Has a Date...honestly did anyone truly ever LIKE them? Did you? They had good hair. And my bands...GSI...buahahaha...damn we SUUUUCKED....but we did have a Japanese girl playing bass! Did any of YOU guys ever have a Japanese girl bass player?...Yep, we were way ahead of our time...The scene (as it was), can only really be summed up in one word...and that word is BEER. We drank beer. We rolled in beer. We swam in large vats of beer. Remember? Of course you don't because of all the beer. Things weren't better then, we were all DRUNK..."  I know it's absurd to think about Johnson City as an idyllic place where life gelled and suddenly made sense, but when you live in a place where nothing happens, and it's up to you to do stuff, then doing nothing can be very good practice for doing something. After the bong-hits, people actually DID stuff! And there's nothing wrong with BEER! Stephen Wright said "24 hours in a day, 24 beers in a case. Coincidence? I think not." Hell, I'm drinking a beer right now. A very good one, brewed in Sevierville by a guy from Knoxville named Ron Downer... you have to check this place out if you get a chance,  urlLink "Rocky River Brewing Company."  Damn good shit. Ask your bartender in JC to pick up their brew -- especially the IPA.   I know there is lots of wonderment about what the hell was so great about JC when most of the time we were bored to tears... but think about it. Imagine living in Atlanta or Miami or New York during those formative years of high school and college. All around you there's tons of art and music and commerce. What incentive do you have to do anything on your own? You're spending all your time checking out what other people are doing. Being a spectator. Where does that get you?   Lets imagine for a second the name of this blog is New York Stories and we are all here discussing stuff that we watched happen that we weren't a part of. Maybe the "quality" of spectating would be higher. Maybe we would be talking about the rise of some band that now sells songs to a car maker or a beauty product. Would we even care enough to say anything about it 10 or 15 or 20 years later? What would be the point?  Johnson City was so devoid of distraction that you HAD to jump right in and do something -- beer or no beer. Not all the bands were good. Even the "good" bands were questionable at times. But, I think we had a connection to each other that we might not have had in another place.   Shit, having worked at the Carroll Reece Museum, I would say that even the art was outstanding in JC during the time. I will never forget Billy Malone's and Duncan Anderson's senior show. Duncan, I LOVED the bunny stuff, especially the furry paintings matching the bunny suit video -- BUT my favorite piece was Billy's. It's probably my all-time favorite artistic statement ever. He took a photograph of Marcel Duchamp to Janet Browning's pastel portrait hut in the mall and had her draw a portrait from it. I'm sure being none the wiser, she took his 30 bucks and did the hack portrait of the father of DaDa and signed her name in the lower right hand corner. He framed this and put it in his show, signing his name on the mat below hers. OH MY GOD, IN A WORLD OF SHIT, THIS MAKES ME HAPPY. Billy Malone, you are my hero! If you are out there, please send a scan!   And it wasn't just high falluting' statements like this that are worth remembering. Plane Jane's Andrew (thanks, Tony) Moore did tropical watercolors, and later REM-industiral-esque work that totally rocked. As I understand it, Andrew had never taken any art classes at the university level and by god, he did these beautiful large-scale paintings that completely energized the JC art scene. It was Moore's unadulterated talent that fueled the interest of JC art buyers and created the market for lots of other artists to peddle their wares in our little backwater. I see stuff at Cumberland Gallery here in Nashville that was passe there, then.   My feeling is if it weren't for boredom, bong-hits and cartoons, there'd be nothing to talk about now. Too bad the folks on "My Life As A Sitcom" won't ever see this shit. They are too busy feeding their jones for the least common denominator. Something we never tolerated.

      we blow a big wind about democracy and freedom -- but, when push comes to a shove -- (depending on where you live) your neighbors would pretty much mow you down in their SUV with mass-mania appropriate to college-football playoffs before honoring your right to dissent.   urlLink case in point . Granted this happened in Cobb County (Gringrich's district), Georgia and God help anyone who lives there, but sheesh -- how ugly is this? A 42-year-old mother of four is spat on, told to get the fuck out of the country, and told to "go to hell" by an elderly man -- in front of television cameras. Why? Because she was exercising her right to free speech by holding a sign that read, "No War for Oil" along the route of a presidential motorcade.   It makes me glad these people live in gated communities. When the shit hits the fan, maybe someone will have the good sense to lock them in.

      ah! i love the ready.gov stuff. i'm getting a t-shirt!  if you haven't already,  urlLink  see the footage of the washington press corps laughing   at Ari Fleischer's big, honking lie about vote buying. (needs RealPlayer... scroll out to 28 or 29 minutes into the clip)  here's the exchange: Q -- the French press is quoting actually two different diplomats from the United States State Department that -- they're highlighting that the United States is giving some sort of agreements or benefits to Colombia -- and other non-members of the Security Council --   MR. FLEISCHER: I haven't seen the story. And you already have the answer, about what this will be decided on. But think about the implications of what you're saying. You're saying that the leaders of other nations are buyable. And that is not an acceptable proposition. (Laughter.)  Thank you.  END 1:03 P.M. EST

       Wal-Mart Rocks!! Man you are gonna love having a Wal-Mart Super Center in Elizabethton! That is just so fucking awesome!!! It will change the way you shop!  A few years ago Kingsport got it’s first Wal-Mart Super Center, and all I can say is it has been super!! Some folks around here said that Wal-Mart was going to destroy the mom and pop stores downtown,,, duh! Lousy service,  crappy selection, and shitty parking destroyed the mom and pop stores down town!! And the mall finished off down town 30 years ago!! Also, there are mom and pop operations literally in the shadow of the JC Wal-Mart that are doing just fine! Wal-Mart does not kill the small family store, Sears, Wards, and JC Penny already did that! Are we to lament the passing of Montgomery Wards?  Until Wal-Mart came to town, we did not know how bad we were getting gouged around here!! Heck the same pair of jeans at Wal-Mart often costs 1/3 more at the Mall, and you have to put up with the haughty attitude of the clerks there,,, fuck that shit, “Just go to Wal-Mart” should become the mantra of the proletariat! I have heard others before say that they would never shop at a Wal-Mart. I am sure this concerns the Walton family  so much they cannot sleep at night......  Wal-Mart Super Center is coming to Elizabethton... Man you are so fucking lucky to get a brand new Wal-Mart!!

      on the club fire thing...  Mark E. Ryalls called the other day to say that "metal needs large, open spaces. Squeeze it in itty bitty clubs, and someone is going to get hurt."   Remember when Thirsty's burned? Anyone recall the circumstances? Anyone recall Kevin Hurley's Top Ten Reasons Why Thirsty's Burned as published in Psychic Sex Turnip? It's quite foggy, but does, "Wintons to Spanex" ring any bells?   There was a band that played at the West Warrick club, a few months back that shot video of their pyro bouncing off the ceiling and spewing back down to the stage. That was before the owners installed new "soundproofing," which was apparently egg-crate foam purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond instead of at a stage supply company. What's the diff? Flammability, price and whether or not it really serves as acoustic insulation.   Acoustic insulation is freakin' expensive because it's crazy-ass engineered shit that won't catch on fire and actually makes a room quieter. The really sad thing is that the club owners/stage manager went out and bought cheap egg-crate which didn't make the club any quieter, and ended up killing 96 people. It's like lining a room with lighter fluid.

      Super Wal Mart in Elizabethton. Well, since Wal Mart is already firmly entrenched in Elizabethton, it doesn't really make much of a difference I don't think, with the exception of adding another grocery store into the competition (god, what a miserable place to get freakin' groceries). I've heard there has been some local retailors objecting, but as someone who wrote to the Johnson City Press recently said, Wal Mart doesn't sell antiques anyway. That said, the only store I hate going in worse than Elizabethton's Wal Mart is Johnson City's Super Wal Mart. So I will definitely not be a shopper at the new super hell-hole (insert all comments lamenting the homogenization of our society here). Speaking of Elizabethton, I have heard on occasion that a couple of decades back, Elizabethton somehow rebuffed Anheiser-Busch from locating a production plant there. God forbid high-paying jobs should have come to town, making a product already sold all through town. But, I'm not sure exactly what happened.   One more aside on the Iraq thing, I read through parts of a book today at the library titled  urlLink The Threatening Storm: the case for invading Iraq  by Kenneth Pollack. It's well organized and probably makes the best case I've heard of why we have no choice but to invade. I read a couple of parts where the author might still be differing with the current administration, one where he felt that Al Qaeda should be properly defanged before going on to Iraq (insert duct tape jokes here). So there's a thought on the other side to balance some of my rants.  Finally, I loved the Plez story about calling the fire department on the Nightmares show; too funny. Had they actually busted up the crowd, I'm sure the plan would have worked...

      Yo and hello, y'all,  Plez here. Hmm. . . what can anybody say about that nightclub fire thing? Awful stuff. Here's what I say about it. What I fear most is not nightclub fires but an overreaction to them. Y'know, I'm sure you're likelier to die falling down your own stairs than in a nightclub fire. Overall. Of course, if someone is using indoor fireworks in your house, I guess your odds of falling down your own stairs go WAY up as you try to find the exit.  I heard that Nashville started doing surprise inspections of local spots. Of course, they will find violations. Naturally, they will. But does that mean we need some sort of super crackdown on nightclub safety? Sprinklers everywhere, no matter how large the club? Would this be a good idea? I don't know. Safety is good. Overreactions are not. But lemme ask this one, too: just what in the heck was Great White's pyro guy thinking? I guess that band still didn't realize they weren't stadium rock ready anymore. In Rupp Arena, I'm sure those showers of sparks would've been no problem. In that place, wow, it's not too surprising that they set something on fire, is it? I mean, I'm not the first guy to notice that from the video, either.  Ok, I have an apology to make, and it does relate to this fire safety issue. Drew, forgive me for telling one of our secrets without your permission. Here goes. The Nightmares were playing one night at the old Quarterbacks, which should've held around 40 people, if you remember. Well, this night, there were about 300 in there or whatever. You all remember how unbelievably crowded that place could get. Well, the Pleztones were playing next door at the Pub Outback, and would you believe our crowd was somewhat SMALLER than theirs, like maybe smaller by about 290 or so. So Drew and I got the idea of walking down to the pay phone at Poor Richard's and making a little call to the fire dept. to report this dangerous situation at Quarterbacks. Heck, if we could get the cops to make 100 or so of 'em leave, they'd probably make their way over to the Pub, huh? Well, after a call to emergency services, we couldn't tell that anything ever happened, which I'm glad of, 'cause (even though I'm laughing remembering this) that was NOT a nice thing to do, so forgive us, Nightmares, and remember, it was probably fourteen or fifteen years ago, and they make Subway sandwiches in that place now.  Ok, most dangerous place I ever remember playing? A frat house we used to play at put us in a basement that had no exit whatsoever except up the stairs. If that place had gotten thick with smoke, whoa that would've been difficult. I'm glad it never happened. And even beyond the fire escape danger, this place was bad. Another story. Pleztones were playing there, with Stinky Finger. (We actually did two or three frat house shows together back then, and the money was better, by far, than the 4 bucks apiece you could expect at Quarterbacks or wherever.) Anyway, at the end of our set, we're rocking out, big closing chord style. Crash, smash, bang-a, bang-a, bang kinda thing. And and the last band, Plez decided to do his stadium rock jump in the air and land on the last chord, y'know. Very Angus indeed. Only, the ceiling here is about 8 feet high, and just below that are various pipes and wires and such. All up to modern codes, I'm sure. So, instead of ending with me doing a little Pete Townshend power chord deal, I crack my head right on a big black sewer pipe. I had a headache for a long time after that, but when I came back down, my hand went triumphantly in the air with RnR salute to the frat guys and their sorority girlfriends. Never let 'em see you sweat. But even more so, never let 'em know you just gave yourself a slight concussion.  Plez out. And by the way, very nice work from all of you on peace and war and such. I've been reading for a while without commentary. Brook, I haven't had a chance to look at the Pleztones stuff you put up, but thanks. Is it still there? I actually couldn't find the link you were talking about at first.   Ok, Plez definitely out.

      I went to a party last night at Jeff Winter's house (Texas Vampires), and he had a few Nightmare's bootleg tapes, but I didn't ask what they were. Thought I'd mention it in case someone is interested. He said he wouldn't mind making copies for someone. He also had Stinky Finger's CD One Hit Too Many, and I listened to that since I only remember hearing them once in the fall, 1987.  Enjoyed it. Came home and felt all inspired to write something creative about the J.C. scene, and wrote a poem, but am hesitant to post it yet. It's really kinda dumb. I need to work on it.

      Dear All  I noticed Brook mentioned the anti war rally at ETSU.  I went to the one in Raleigh NC on Feb. 15th.  It was fairly larger than I expected, at least 5000 people.    I won't put my two cents about Iraq here, since it's basically preaching to the choir.      However, if you go to www.nowarsign.org,  you can order a fancy anti-war sign for your own front yard, just like I've got.  4 or 5 of my neighbors, too.  Damn..... I just can't resist.  I think the Bush Admin.  wants the war not mainly for Iraqi oil.  I think they want to do to Iraq what Bush Sr. (with Cheney as his Sect. of Defense) did in Panama in 1989;  ensure a client state in a strategic area to ensure as many large military bases as they want, to hold sway in the Middle East.  "Our" bases in Panama allow this in South America, same as the Phillipines in Asia.  I guess Israel and Saudi just aren't reliable enough for the New American Century.  Love,  Kurt

      That was a scary  Frontline  tonight. So the Hawks are in control at the Bush Whitehouse. Clearly recognized as dangerous and unworkable by Bush 41, Bush 43 has now converted to the cause of the right-wing Hawks. Colin Powell has effectively lost in the tug of war for the President's ear. It is clear that going to war with Iraq is only the first step in a far broader plan. The entire middle east, then North Korea; all to be democratized. Iraq is merely the first step. Against the will of the world, the world will undergo a series of wars to reshape the world in our image. Now, democracy is a good thing, to be sure, but it is not clear by no means how easy it will be to sweep through and set up democratic nations. Hell, its not clear that we can successfully do it in any nation. For that matter, we're having our own problems with democracy in the United States. This plan is crazy and very dangerous. our allies and many foriegn policy experts don't think this will work; many in the current defense department believe this is wrong, and they purposefully leaked it to the media in hopes of exposing it to the light of public strutiny, before the 2002 elections. But we the people blew it, and Bush interprets the elections as a mandate to proceed.  Another point became clear from this show; while the President may believe he is dealing with terrorism, our focus and foriegn policy has effectively been coopted by this dramatic shift to the doctrine of preemptive military action. This is a first in our country. So really, if we have to draw WW II comparison, as I have read so much of on the web lately, Nazi Germany adopted much of this strategy too. Our country must not become an invader, an agressor; yet it is here before our eyes, all without much credible debate, thanks to coward politicians and a corporate whore media.   I have talked to people who believe that 9/11 gives us a mandate to do whatever we want in the world. I have talked to people that claim the mere fact that Iraq didn't apologize for 9/11, even though it didn't do it, is reason enough for war. I have talked to people that advocate nuclear responses to those that resist our military campaigns. Is this what we want? Does this sound consistent with our country's history?  Next post I'll try and lighten up some, but I'm revved up right now.

      Allen's link to neo-conservative, Charles Krauthammer's odd Washington Post piece, Holiday from History reminded me that there's a new FRONTLINE airing tomorrow,  urlLink War Behind Closed Doors . It airs Thursday, February 20 on your local PBS station at 9pm eastern and 8pm central. It will look at whether the publicly reported reasons--fear of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction or a desire to insure and protect America's access to oil--are only masking the real reason for the war. Should be interesting.  Now to Krauthammer's really, really bizarre column. He has two points: that the earth faces extinction via terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction AND that Clinton is responsible for this.   It is head-spinning to say the least that a neo-conservative has seen an extinction he doesn't like, but the real audacity is for Krauthammer to suggest that the Clinton administration was soft on terrorism when it was the Clinton Administration that provided the incoming Bush admin the devastating terrorism warning known as the  urlLink Hart-Rudman Commission Report  on January 21, 2001 which predicted an attack on the United States where, "Americans will likely die on American soil, possibly in large numbers." In it, Hart specifically mentioned the lack of preparation for "a weapon of mass destruction in a high-rise building." After months of stonewalling, Senator Hart was so concerned he personally visited the Bush White House, meeting National Security adviser Condoleezza Rice on September 6, just five days before the terrorist attacks. Condi said she would "pass on" his concerns.  The rest is history, and it hasn't been a holiday.   Dick Cheney shelved the report and instead opted to spearhead his own group but did nothing for FOUR months while they were negotiating with the Taliban to build an oil pipeline from Central Asia thru Afghanistan to Pakistan. From February 5, 2001 until August 4, 2001, the oily Bush administration threw caution to the wind hoping to do bidness with the Taliban who were known to have ties to Osama bin Laden. The Clinton Administration was so concerned about OBL's terrorist camps in Afghanistan that he cut commercial ties in July 1999 (in addition to launching a missile attack in 1998) after the Taliban refused to hand over Osama bin Laden.  Clinton wasn't on a Holiday from History. Moreover, it would be incorrect to say the Bush administration was "holiday" (although Bush had only days before 9-11 emerged from his month-long Crawford Ranch Vacation). His inattention was borne of a business trip.

      I'm embarrassed to say- but I saw that part of My Life is a Sitcom. They said "...and up next The Sampsons from Johnson City, Tenn" So I had to watch. Yuck- that guy's accent was so forced and he claimed to live on a farm even though you could tell his three sons had never seen a live cow before. It was bad all the way around (stupid show period).

      Congratulations are in order for Johnson City's big debut on ABC Family Channel's show My Life is a Sitcom! The Sampson's offer a fairly good caricature of JC-residentialism, do they not? The family won the round based on their potential to be a "modern-day Andy Griffith show," reinforcing the cliche, if it's "country" and on TV, it must be Mayberry.   Don't know about you guys, but I'm really tired of everything rural being compared to The Andy Griffith Show. It's like comparing every tacky Italian Restaurant wall sculpture to Michelangelo's David. See, here's The Sampson's:    And here is Andy Griffith:    Sampsons:    Andy:    The Andy Griffith Show was art. As the de-facto leader of Mayberry, Andy Taylor was an authority figure comfortable enough with himself to allow others to be themselves. The ethic was understated. Outsiders were invited in. The fallen were lifted up. Disruptions were resolved, and not every detail required explanation. Wouldn't it be nice if JC were more like Mayberry?   The elegant equation that was Andy Griffith didn't owe EVERYTHING FREAKIN THING to the rural setting. It could just as well in a 'borough in Chicago, or the shore in Maine, or a village in Ethiopia. Just because you have a country cooter on the teevee, doesn't mean you've got Andy Griffith.

It's corny and kind of trite, but there is truth in it: Friends have feelings too, so don't bruise 'em; you must take 'em as you find 'em, or you'll lose 'em. A simple principle for a child, it seems to me, is a rule that applies also to adults who run countries. Don't burn your bridges behind you. Don't piss off your allies. Don't ignore the fact that you belong to a community larger than yourself.

      What's so disturbing about all this war thing is that it will set a dangerous precedent for similar behavior on the part of any other country in the world besides us. Pre-emption is a new, scary thing---to go into a country unprovoked with no real, solid evidence that you can show, other than that their leader is unstable (and, to me, that's the pot calling the kettle black) and that they might have weapons, none of which compare to the number and magnitude of our own. If we can do this now, then so can everyone else---it will change the face of the world forever. It will render the United Nations and international law null and void. It will result in paranoia and chaos run amuck. The world doesn't like a bully--and we're looking much more like the bully than anyone else.

      from TAD DICKENS...  Time for another early-morning post.   First, I want to start by saying, Rick, I'm a big fan, and Dink, I don't know you, but if Frank Bowman had your back, then you must be OK. It appears, though, that you both are more than a little misguided on this Iraq thing. I want to make this simple. As I've said before, we have had Saddam Hussein penned in for years, and we regularly engage him in battle. On top of that, we now have U2s patrolling the skies, constant satellite imaging, and lots of operatives on the ground. On the other hand, our old friend Mr. bin Ladin is still making videos which have wide play throughout the Arab world, exhorting others to take up his cause. We're damned right to be afraid of something, but it ain't in Iraq. Maybe someday, but right now, we've still got a score to settle with the al-quaeda.   For some reason, despite the fact that we own Afghanistan now, we're not very interested in it. Yes, we have the occasional firefight with Taliban and stragglers from The Base, but why in the fuck are we mobilizing our forces in a preliminary show of strength in Iraq when we're much better off putting every goddam soldier we can spare in Afghanistan? I've been listening to some talk about "the good war" on this blog, and how that was justified and Iraq is not. Some here may disagree with me, but I think Afghanistan is the closest we've come to WWII since 1945. First off, there was just a humanitarian mess going on over there. Woman were absolutely subjugated, ancient religious icons were destroyed out of pure ignorance, and the leadership hosted a man whose main intention is to control the Middle East and kill anyone who eats at McDonald's. It took the destruction of U.S. property to get us over there, which is too bad, but it finally woke us up to do something in that fucking warlord-driven pit besides give them weapons and training to fight the Russians. Then, just like we did in Iraq a decade ago, we got the hell out of there before the job was finished. Talk about not learning from our HISTORY!   We should have every cave in eastern Afghanistan and western Pakistan staked out or occupied by our troops. If Musharef don't like it, rock the casbah, I say, but no, it's not happening. I remember Bush talking all that shit about getting bin Ladin "dead or alive," like a goddam cowboy or something. But now it's not so important for us to have him, our leaders say. What a bunch of limp-dick bullshit. Absolutely nothing would be symbolically better at this point to demoralize The Base and make all our duct-tape buying, plastic hoarding pussies feel good than to show us all that motherfucker's head sticking out of the sand, with maggots coming out of his eyes. I fucking hate Osama bin Ladin for what he's done to this country, and I'm pissed off at our leaders for letting him go on with impunity. You just don't let a woman-hating religious zealot set the agenda for anybody, but that's exactly what we're letting him do. Meanwhile, we're all set to go in and bomb fucking Iraq for no good reason other than it's easier than plan A.   I have a hypothesis about the reason why the Bushies favor plan A2. Republicans have to have a boogie man. Whether it's hippies or communists or Willie Horton or the Ayatollah or Bill Clinton or welfare mothers, they have to prop up a straw man to give people something to hate, so they can get on with the business of making themselves richer and more powerful. I know this is a broad stroke, but I've just seen it too many times.What better boogie man to have than bin Ladin. He serves three purposes: He makes people scared and angry and frustrated; he allows the Bushies to get rid of their now-useless boogie man, Saddam; and he gives our corporations easier excuses to control more oil. Hydrogen cells my ASS! The next 20 years are crucial to the history of our environment, and Bush is talking about hydrogen cell vehicles, which won't be available for, you guessed it, about another 20 years. This literally fell into the administration's lap, unless you believe the conspiracy theories out there (I don't. I think we just plain old screwed the pooch with our handling of bin Ladin before Sept 11. But that's another discussion.)   My more dovish blog colleagues will disagree, but there are plenty of good reasons to be rid of Saddam, and none of them have to do with oil. Read Thomas Friedman in the New York Times for good arguments about fucking that devil. And in other scenarios down the road, I wouldn't necessarily disagree with doing it. But there is absolutely no need to go in there now, while we're making slow and steady progress with the inspections, and the world is getting angrier and angrier with us about our plans. But here we are, ready to sacrifice our own soldiers, not to mention possibly hundreds of thousands of our friends in Israel and Turkey (who will both get a few shots of chemical warhead action -- remember, Patriot missles DON'T WORK!)   But now we're in a nearly untenable position. Even Colin Powell has sold his soul, for Christ's sake. No good can come of this. I wanted to travel the world before I died, but fuck that now. We'll all just be fucking targets after we do it this way. But who cares, right? It'll make for exciting TV, we'll have something to feel good about, and the baby boomers -- well, they're just going to have to get used to having no decent retirement, unless they were already rich, of course.   I'm tired now, and I'm going to bed.

        A really good  Case Against the War:    "This autumn and winter, nuclear danger has returned, in a new form, accompanied by danger from the junior siblings in the mass destruction family, chemical and biological weapons. Now it is not a crisis between two superpowers but the planned war to overthrow the government of Iraq that, like a sentence of execution that has been passed but must go through its final appeals before being carried out, we have talked to death. (Has any war been so lengthily premeditated before it was launched?) Iraq, the United States insists, possesses some of these weapons. To take them away, the United States will overthrow the Iraqi government. No circumstance is more likely to provoke Iraq to use any forbidden weapons it has. In that event, the Bush Administration has repeatedly said, it will itself consider the use of nuclear weapons. Has there ever been a clearer or more present danger of the use of weapons of mass destruction?"  urlLink continue...

      YOU ARE BEING LIED TO Terror Alert Partly Based on Fabricated Information  Feb. 13 — A key piece of the information leading to recent terror alerts was fabricated, according to two senior law enforcement officials in Washington and New York.      The officials said that a claim made by a captured al Qaeda member that Washington, New York or Florida would be hit by a "dirty bomb" sometime this week had proven to be a product of his imagination.   The informant described a detailed plan that an al Qaeda cell operating in either Virginia or Detroit had developed a way to slip past airport scanners with dirty bombs encased in shoes, suitcases, or laptops, sources told ABCNEWS. The informant reportedly cited specific targets of government buildings and Christian or clerical centers.   "This piece of that puzzle turns out to be fabricated and therefore the reason for a lot of the alarm, particularly in Washington this week, has been dissipated after they found out that this information was not true," said Vince Cannistraro, former CIA counter-terrorism chief and ABCNEWS consultant.   It was only after the threat level was elevated to orange — meaning high — last week, that the informant was subjected to a polygraph test by the FBI, officials told ABCNEWS.   "This person did not pass," said Cannistraro.  urlLink more

         ETSU rallies against war  Marchers in Thursday’s peace demonstration at East Tennessee State University said they hoped to be seen as patriotic participants in democracy, not anti-American dissidents.  “This is what America is all about,” Josh Gambrel, president of the newly organized campus Green Party, said in a pre-march rally at the ETSU amphitheater. “I wouldn’t be fighting if I didn’t think there was something worth fighting for.”  Intended to protest the Bush administration’s path toward war with Iraq, the rally and march drew about 150 participants, as well as a few babies in arms and “protest dogs” on leashes. ETSU students, faculty and staff members and a few local residents braved cold twilight temperatures and brisk winds to lend their voices to the effort.  urlLink more

      Dogtown and Z Boys was one of the best documentaries ever and there was a lesson about doing your own thing and doing it well and letting the rest follow in your wake. That photo of Gary reminds me of seeing him play -- he used that same move with the bass. Now I know the rest of the story.   We decided a long time ago not to impose any kind of "test" to have the right to vote. The really bothersome thing about the butterfly ballots in Florida was the number of "over-votes." Where there was more than one candidate punched. How easy would it have been for anyone to to just make extra punches. Why wasn't that a widespread phenomena outside of the one district.   No matter who won or lost, the questions surrounding the election in Florida should worry any patriot. But we all know Rush isn't a patriot. No one who claims a pimple on his ass as a reason to sit out the war is not worthy of patriot-status. Al Gore volunteered. Where was Rush? Hiding out, applying ointment to his butt.

Recently I started reading "Stupid White Men" by  Michael Moore.  The opening chapter re-shocked me all over again about our American coup. Thousands of legal, law abiding black citizens thrown off the voter rolls in Florida. In some districts blacks were kept from the voting booths at gunpoint. I'm not going to get over it, and nobody should. Welcome to the United Banana Republic of America.     I ran across some skateboarding pictures. This one is Mr. Gary Miller catching an air at  Kona skate park  in Jacksonville FL circa a decade or two ago. I recently saw a  really good movie about skateboarding:  Dogtown and Z Boys.

      (Never has there been such unity against a war BEFORE it happens.) 10 MILLION JOIN WORLDWIDE PEACE PROTESTS  Up to 10 million people on five continents are expected to demonstrate against the probable war in Iraq on Saturday, in some of the largest peace marches ever known.   Yesterday, up to 400 cities in 60 countries, from Antarctica to Pacific islands, confirmed that peace rallies, vigils and marches would take place. Of all major countries, only China is absent from the growing list which includes more than 300 cities in Europe and north America, 50 in Asia and Latin America, 10 in Africa and 20 in Australia and Oceania.   Many countries will witness the largest demonstrations against war they have ever seen.   What is extraordinary, say the organisers, is the depth and breadth of opposition that the US and Britain are meeting across the world before a war has even started.   "This is unprecedented. Demonstrations only got this large against the Vietnam war at the height of the conflict, years after it started," said a spokesman for Answer, a coalition of US peace groups which helped organise a march of 200,000 people last month in Washington.   urlLink more...

      If you've visited Shots Across the Bow to see Rich's "Those who do not learn from history" statement, you might have already figured out the mistake in his reasoning. By his own words, "the American public had no interest in the war in Europe prior to the Japanese attack." Dude! There was already a war going on. Plenty of people had died, cities were ruined and balance of power in Europe was in peril. My point was that the mobilization of anti-war sentiment is happening PRIOR to a war breaking out. Anti-war activists wish to preserve the balance of power and avoid the loss of life and the destruction of cities BEFORE any of this happens.  Another thing, Gulf War Part Two, is NOT aimed at putting a stop to widespread conflict or human atrocities (as the Democratic-backed intervention in World War II was). It is about outfitting an unprecedented global empire (as outlined by William Kristol, Richard Pearle, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, and Jeb Bush  in the  urlLink Project for a New American Century  mission statement which pines for "some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new Pearl Harbor"), and jack-booting any attempts by rival nations, or free people anywhere, to do anything about it.   Indeed, those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. That's why I would suggest that Mr. Shots Across The Bow familiarize himself with Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War which documents how Athens' corrupted democracy was brought to ruin by the hunger for empire in the conquest of Sicily.

ANTI-WAR BANNER HUNG OVER BILLBOARD ON I-40 IN WEST KNOXVILLE BANNER READS: FRODO HAS FAILED -- BUSH HAS THE RING  Knoxville, Tennessee, February 13, 2003 - Local Earth First! activists have hung a giant anti-war banner over an interstate billboard in west Knoxville this morning.  The banner, which reads, ?Frodo has failed ? Bush has the ring!? was hung early this morning over a Hooter?s billboard in a plot of land between I-40, Gallaher View Road, and Kingston Pike.  Thousands of morning rush hour commuters headed eastbound on I-40 are expected to see the message.  Two climbers are staying up on the billboard in an attempt to display the banner all day long as part of a nonviolent direct action against the impending war on Iraq.  The activists also hope to advertise the rally against the war this Saturday at 11am at Morrell and Kingston Pike.   Call the Tromo billboard company, and ask them to please not press charges!

If the terrorists are frisky, Pakistan is looking shifty, North Korea is too risky, Bomb Iraq.  If we have no allies with us, bomb Iraq. If we think someone has dissed us, bomb Iraq.

      True story from the garage at my dealership:   Q: "How do you get rid of the sticky goo left behind  when you remove duct tape?"  A: "Why would you remove duct tape?........ What would cause you to do that?"  Remember kids, duct tape and WD-40 are the yin and yang of the american tool box! ( that according to the Bob and Tom show, which we don't get around here anymore)  One more true story. Two summers ago I traveled to New Mexico backpacking with a group of boy scouts I work with, One of the kids had made his wallet out of duct tape, and it looked and fuctioned like any wallet would, except that it was all silver and canvas textured. More amazingly he had a photo of the tux he had worn to his prom, or planned to, that was likewise made of our silver adhesive companion, duct tape. The fit appeared quite good, though I would not reccommend dancing in it.

      Actually, the word Milquetoast is a comic, Frenchish reworking of ye olde English term 'milk toast', a bland dish of toast soaked in milk.

Announcement-putting. Picture posting. Whatever. It's your space. I just make sure people can be added when they request.

      First of all... Bill has a military-age kid?!! Whaaaaa? I never knew.   Secondly, it's Milquetoast -- and i only mention this because it is one of my all-time favorite words -- along with hootenanny and epiphenomenal.   And thirdly -- I totally stand with anyone voicing dissent to the dangerous and stupid war and civil-liberty-eradicating crap being tossed at us by the bad monkey in the White House. But, I know not all JC bloggers share this view. I just want to affirm that fact. So there's my administrator's disclaimer. Please use this space to hash this shit out. Play nice and wear protection.  With that in mind, I want to add something that I find disturbing. In the last couple of weeks I received emails and calls from people who are really REALLY worried and depressed about this impending war. I guess people figure I stay on top of this shit and can lend some perspective to their anxiety. Like everyone else, I feel like I'm watching a train wreck, and there isn't shit I can do. I'm outraged, and as the calls have emails have shown me, retreat isn't an option. Current events have captured the attention the vast majority of the politically inactive -- have mobilized the mainstream, middle ground, middle class, middle american. Never has there been such unity against a war BEFORE it happens. The challenge is to do something with this energy. It's not enough to get mad and it feels crappy to just be depressed.  Chris is absolutely right in pointing fury at corporate media. The media took a right turn during the 90s with the help a very well-funded right-wing political apparatus ( urlLink this  is a great article outlining the "vast conservative conspiracy"). We might not have the money (yet, or ever), but we have the numbers because we (the people, as opposed to left, right and middle) ARE the majority. So, if any of the shit going on keeps you awake at night -- do what you can. Write a letter to the editor. Email news directors at CNN and MSNBC. Complain. Go to a demonstration. Put a bumper sticker on your car. Write your representatives. Be heard while it's still legal.  I KNOW all us bloggers don't agree on this stuff and that's okay. Please, grab the (virtual) pitcher of beer, pour a mug, and join the rant in our little virtual round table at Quarterbacks.

      Chris’ post about life in Baghdad should go out to every major newspaper. He stated some legitimate concerns that our media never will. And that picture of the "mile of death" is a good example of the level of "reporting" we got (or rather didn’t get) from the Desert Storm round. I went back and looked at that series of photos; it’s infuriating that these pictures are basically below the American radar. What really makes me sick is when Bush goes on about concerns for the Iraqi people being a contributing factor for war. Bull shit. He doesn’t give a toss about the Iraqi people. If it was really all about the people, we wouldn’t be gearing up to bomb them back to the stone-age.  One of the major complaints against Saddam is that he has killed many innocents, so in retaliation, we will go bomb many innocents. People won’t even give it much thought really. Even when it happens, there are plenty of other channels to tune in to anyway. If we were really so concerned about civilians, we would risk our own lives and go in without bombing an entire city. If all the war supporters were really so concerned they should consult the handy links Chris provided and enlist. Other countries on the UN Security Council, such as Russia, France and Germany are formulating a plan to have more inspectors and a UN peacekeeping force rather than war. It still doesn’t have to be war; there are still other ways that can be tried. Didn’t the concept of "last resort" used to be associated with war?  Bill Edwards, all the best to your son. Chris Slaughter, I don’t think we ever really met, but next time you’re in JC I owe you a beer or something for so ably expressing your most righteous anger about this most serious and saddening situation in the world. Barbara, met your mom recently at the library, we talked about the Nightmares reunion a bit; nice lady. One more round of reunion shows would be nice before the world blows up. Maybe next time it could be Plez, Stinky Finger, and the Nightmares...

      I also said a while back that I would get around to responding to Dink, but Brook has excelled so well at it, that it seems a moot point. Also I felt I should respond to Brook, but she clarified that she was wrong about supporting the troops, so that seems moot too.....  Dink, Capitolism requires a competative marketplace... when contracts are given without bidding, competition is circumnavigated in favor of nepotism. If Clinton had done that would the right wing have stayed quiet?  A couple of questions for ya: How can the right wing justify fighting a war to bring democracy to Iraq, when just over 2 years ago they were telling me that we don't live in a democracy, we live in a republic?  And why doesn't Arkansas rhyme with Kansas??  Finally, when this is all over, and I pray it will be soon, will we have to listen to republicans say how heroic Bush is., when the most dangerous thing he has personally done is hop Marine One to Camp David?  Until next time.....

      'You Should Have Known We'd Fight' By Burhan al-Chalabi The Guardian - UK 3-24-3  It is now five days since the British and US governments launched an unprecedented military invasion of my country of birth, its people, land, towns and cities. This attack was launched without UN authority, public support or the will of the international community. To win support for this unjust and illegal campaign, it has been claimed that this is not a colonial war of occupation but a war of liberation; a compassionate war. Britain and the US will save the Iraqis by bombing so they can thrive in a democratic Iraq and live at ease with their neighbours. Those who believed the hype expected the Iraqis to welcome the invading armies. After British troops were forced to retreat from Basra yesterday, a military spokesman said: "We were expecting a lot of hands up, but it hasn't quite worked out that way."     It is now clear to everyone that ordinary Iraqis are resisting this military aggression with their lives and souls. Commentators and politicians in Britain and America seem taken aback: how come the Iraqis are putting up such a fight? Why do they so passionately resist this attempt to liberate them from the brutal dictator, Saddam? But Iraqis aren't surprised at all.     When Iraq was first colonised by Britain in 1917, Iraqis were fed the same British propaganda about liberation through occupation. We fought the best part of last century to get rid of colonial Britain and, since then, have helped a great number of independence movements worldwide. Iraqis may wish for the current regime to change, but anyone who understands our culture will know that in this war Iraqis will fight and die, not to save President Saddam Hussein, but to protect their home, land, dignity and self-respect from a new world order alien to their way of life. We are an enormously proud people.     And so history repeats itself. Just as in the past century, the military superiority of the Anglo-American invaders may eventually overwhelm the Iraqi army, which is weak and ill-equipped because of sanctions, containment and isolation. But there is also no doubt that in the end this military crusade against Iraq will fail just like the previous British occupation of Iraq, led by General Maude, where the military odds were just as much in favour of the British army. Iraqis - in particular the Arab-Iraqi Shi'ites - fought bitter and hard and suffered thousands of casualties in order to liberate Iraq from the British occupation. They will do so again.     It is true that, this time, the British and US forces may assume control of sea, air and deserts of Iraq, but they will never win the war for the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people. Not only do the people of Iraq face devastation by the US and UK aggression on a scale not previously known to mankind, but they also face death and destruction by another war - the civil war that would inevitably follow. We know what this means, because we have been there before.     As a young lad in the town of Mosul I lived through the horror of the civil war in Iraq in 1959-60, when the communist and Kurdish coalition fought the nationalists for control of the country. With my brothers and parents, we used to hide huddled together, in a small concealed basement for days on end, absolutely terrified of being slaughtered because we were considered to be on the Nationalist side.     I saw Iraqis split in half, while alive, by two cars. Girls were hanged from telegraph posts, with fish hooks through their breasts. Men were hanged outside my school gates. We were forced to watch mass hangings in public squares. Dead bodies with their throats slit lay in the streets.     Forty years on, in the comfort and safety of London, those images remain vivid. A scar of fear for life, and one shared by a great many of my people.     This is the fate that awaits "liberated" Iraq. Only today, the Kurds - backed by the US - have even more violent scores to settle. There are many, many people in Iraq today who fear the sectarian violence that may result from the breakdown of the secular regime; and Iraqi history shows that they are right to fear it. I do not wish this future to await anybody in the world, friend or foe.     Neither the British nor the American forces will be able to react quickly enough in order to prevent the slaughter of innocent civilians in the ensuing civil war. In the aftermath there will not be an Iraq to re-build, but simply chaos.     So the message from Iraq is clear: go home and leave us alone. You will never be welcome in Iraq as colonisers. Stop destroying Iraq. Do not bury our nation. Stop the war and give peace and the UN inspectors a chance in the name of humanity.

      Don't know if you are familiar with Zell Miller, the past governor of Georgia, and who is now Georgia's junior senator in Washington, but this article that appeared in the newspaper is very appropriate.  (And believe it or not, he's a Democrat!)  Zell Miller knows how to boil things down to the basics. That's what Georgia's junior senator did Thursday when he explained why it's important that Saddam Hussein be defanged.  But he's also a good storyteller. Here's the text of Mr. Miller's remarks, made on the Senate floor about the need to help President Bush deal with Iraq.   "Mr. President, I have signed on as an original co-sponsor of the Iraq resolution, and I'd like to tell you a story about why I think it is the right path to take:  A few weeks ago, we were doing some work on my back porch back home, tearing out a  section of old stacked rocks, when all of a sudden I uncovered a nest of copperhead snakes.  Now, I'm not one to get alarmed at snakes. I know they perform some useful functions, like eating rats. And when I was a young lad, I kept snakes as pets. I had an indigo snake, a bull snake, a corn snake and many others. I must  have had a dozen king snakes at one time or another.  They make great pets and you only had to feed them a mouse every 30 days.  I read all the books by Raymond C. Ditmars, who was the foremost herpetologist of his day. That's an expert on snakes.  For a while, I wanted to be a herpetologist, but the pull of being a big-league shortstop outran that childhood dream.  I reminisce this way to explain that snakes don't scare me like they do some people. And I guess the reason is that I know the difference between those that are harmless and those that will kill you.  In fact, I bet I may be the only senator in this body who can look at the last three inches of a snake's tail and tell you whether it's poisonous or not. I can also tell the sex of a snake, but that's another story.  A copperhead will kill you. It could kill one of my dogs. It could kill one of my grandchildren. It could kill any of my four great grandchildren. They play all the time where I found these killers.  And you know, when I discovered these copperheads, I didn't call my wife Shirley and ask her advice, like I do on most things. I didn't yell for help from my neighbors or take it to the city council. I just took a hoe and knocked them in the head and killed them. Dead as a doorknob.  I guess you could call it a unilateral action. Or pre-emptive or even bellicose and reactive.  I took their poisonous heads off because they were a  threat to me. And they were a threat to my home and my family. They were a threat to all I hold dear.  And isn't that what this is  all about?"

      Thanks for posting that Bill/Rick (Blick). It illustrates exactly what i mean when i say the troops neither need nor deserve emotional support.  Update: Still no weapons of mass destruction. Still no evidence of a 9-11 connection. Our standing as defenders of democracy and freedom -- in ashes.  Today, It is We Americans Who Live in Infamy by Arthur Schlesinger Jr. NEW YORK -- We are at war again -- not because of enemy attack, as in World War II, nor because of incremental drift, as in the Vietnam War -- but because of the deliberate and premeditated choice of our own government.  Now that we are embarked on this misadventure, let us hope that our intervention will be swift and decisive, and that victory will come with minimal American, British and civilian Iraqi casualties.  But let us continue to ask why our government chose to impose this war. The choice reflects a fatal turn in U.S. foreign policy, in which the strategic doctrine of containment and deterrence that led us to peaceful victory during the Cold War has been replaced by the Bush Doctrine of preventive war. The president has adopted a policy of "anticipatory self-defense" that is alarmingly similar to the policy that imperial Japan employed at Pearl Harbor on a date which, as an earlier American president said it would, lives in infamy.  urlLink more

      Let me state for the record -- godspeed to sons and nephews, sisters and brothers. As soldiers, that was their choice. As soldiers, they don't want our sympathy. As soldiers in an unjust war, destabilzing war -- they are victims of a corrupt government. It is doubly insulting to them (as sons, daughters, etc) to say nothing and sit on your hands, in their name.

      (apropos to nothing except my anger which is in full-bloom right now.)  People who VOLUNTEERED for the military -- soldiers -- fully understanding that their sole mission is to KILL bad guys and therefore stand the risk of being killed themselves, DO NOT merit sentimentality in the form of "support our troops," or "bring them home safely," or any crap involving emotional outpouring. They are trained to do a job and their job is to go out there and kill and be killed. The blood of the troops is on Bush's hands. Not mine. Fuck a bunch of "support the troops" propaganda.   Saying it's about supporting the troops is a lame, Wal-Mart brand of state-approved sentiment. We HAVE to SUPPORT the troops or else face the charge of disrespecting the vets like when protesters in the 60s supposedly spat upon returning Vietnam vets. Well, guess what! urlLink  That is a lie .   No one has ever corroberated the "spitting protester" myth. It never happened. And the only purpose the story serves is to SHAME anyone who might dissent from dropping bombs on third world countries.   All this talk about our poor troops being in danger is insulting. Of course they're in danger -- it's a fucking war for christsakes. They are soldiers serving in the best-equipped fighting force on the face of the earth. They don't require my emotional support. They already have my tax money. That's all they get.  You don't have to be against the war because our trained fighting force might be in danger. Be against the war because His Illegitimacy, Bush, is a lying patsy and he's destroyed more than a half century of collective security in pursuit of a  urlLink wacko neo-con plan for world domination .   If we really cared about the military we'd make damn sure to  urlLink avoid this war thru diplomacy .   If we really cared, we'd bitch-slap the  urlLink Republicans for cutting money to the Veterans Administration and VA hospitals .   And, if Saddam was such a big threat, don't you think one of his belly-flopping SCUDs would have killed some people by now? Where's the Iraq-sponsored attack on American soil? Where's the incursion into Israel? Where's the weapons of mass destruction? If the whole idea is that his WMD are a threat to the US, don't you think he would be putting them to use NOW?  urlLink  We've all been lied to.

      ok so the clinton thing was a bit of a stretch...  .and i loved the poem ... ..that was great .. , thank you .. sorry if i was venting .. I 'll slow down and go back to normal .. i guess i was a little worked up .. and worried about those kids .. kids in the desert .. just kids wearing gas mask and puting chemical suits on .. in the desert..  .. wow a one hit war .. if Sadam has 45 decoy Sadam's .???. ( well 44 after this morning attack )..it looks like a Turkey shoot  .. excuse the pun i think they are now part of the "coilition of the willing"   bill i look fwd to hearing from you ..  just the fact that we are talking about it is good ...we all are trying to find answers to things going on all around us that is so historic it is allmost too much to digest ... a missle hit sort  of kind of seems like a mafia hit  allmost ..Team Bush is thinking outside the box ..... it seems like state sponsored assination instead of a war a little bit dont it?  .. ( but i guess theres no turning back ).. something we have allways been against   but it is a different way to fight a war ...I guess  we got some of them but still have 44 Sadams to go ... like a play station game ,,, kill the Sadams with a missle guided from space by some 22 year old kid in a 10x 10 airconditioned moveable control room in Kuwate.  .Its  like in Doonesberry where the intern calls in an air strikes,,.... for these kids with this technology the screen just goes blank .. they dont die in a jungle on this one it would appear.. boy i would hate to just by bad luck of the draw be a guy who looked like Sadam in that area right now..

      Well, here's that poem I  said was on the way. It's a sestina. You can see the form--repetition of the words at the end of each line of the first stanza in the following stanzas, only in varying order. There you go.  Poetry lesson from Julie, which I know everyone wanted. The poem is sort of indirectly related to the J.C. music scene, but more about myself--the only topic I can speak on with any authority. I'm working on another one though, about the music more specifically. Ciao. Hope it's enjoyed.    Traveling: A Sestina  Despite the distance, I liked driving from Chicago to Johnson City, moving across the slick highway like a dry, lone soldier hoarding images of my own small town past in a suitcase, insanely composed, ready to hand them over to the bravest human properly attired; a man who carried his own pain like a torch shouting, “Hey, fucking look at this!” -- yet hiding.  I remember standing on a stool inside a “music venue”, hiding behind the noise of something too hip, carrying an entire city in my veins. You were the only soul who saw my twisted torch; it was really a stupid billboard; a drama given for some soldier who had not yet truly suffered. I wasn’t even yet a human who could name her pain. I was only carrying a suitcase  of misplaced desire. Still, inside that weird vision, that suitcase of twisted knowledge, I guessed, and I touched you, hiding out loud. Within my imagination, you see, the word *human* wasn’t skin and bone singing but more the language of a soldier whose mind is separated from the huge, billowing torch that whispers a specific, visceral song. I inhaled a glowing city  and exhaled “nothing”. “See?,” I said. And - “In the glowing city I can carry my dreams across the highway.” - or - “a suitcase of understanding that remains private.” - or - “a huge torch I can fold into precise, measured portions and carefully hide in a high place.” You laughed. “I didn’t realize that a human could think of that,” you said, and sat like a true soldier.  Now, when I consider certain melodies, I see outlines of soldiers propped on their elbows, legs crossed. They see the pure city of desire, and exhale an empty canvas. Yet they say “Human emotion is measurable.” Hah. The vast importance of a suitcase of cheap memories doesn’t go unnoticed. The need to hide persists. I can hear them. “Poor thing. she still carries a torch  that smells like yesterday.” But they do not hear the soldier in my voice - the thing that molds then fills an enormous suitcase of memory. No matter. Like me, they too still carry a torch.

      Well, if controversy is what you crave...  If the so-called patriotic war-supporters were real, red-blooded Americans, they would be comfortable and confident -- even accomodating of dissent and discourse -- since democracy and freedom are the values we are supposedly fighting this war for in the first place.  Show me evidence that the secular, Stalinist, Saddam had anything to do with the ostensibly Islamist attack on the World Trade Center. Show me the evidence that Saddam has weapons of mass destruction. Show me the evidence of any connection to Al-Qaida.  On the other hand, it is a fact that Bush fabricated, plagiarized and padded intelligence reports. It is a fact that the Bush has bugged and intercepted private correspondence of our allies in the United Nations. It is a fact that Halliburton is profiting enormously from this "war." It is a fact that civil liberties have eroded. And it is a fact that this "war" will promote hatred and terrorist reprisals.   Therefore, it is a fact that everyone, including the Dixie Chicks, has a responsibility to speak up, take part and debate the course of events. To go along with an unjust war is immoral. A president conducting an unjust war is to a president receiving a blow-job what premeditated murder is to a speeding ticket.

      ok here goes then if the throat thing was better  i think the suprem ct was right ,, Bush won  I want to kill any person like Sadam and his rapist son's and evil supporters ,,  yes i do before they get me and my family  I WANT TO KIll anyone who supports terriost who wants to kill me and my family and wants my way of life(ice cream , mouses ear stuff llike that) killed ie..  inifels,and amercia's that means me and you .. or us all unless you are one of his nut followers... I belive Sadam is a bad guy not Bush  I am ashamed of the ditzy chicks  I think you should ask some one who was in nyc on 911 what they think  I dont think france should set our policy on international affairs I have a sister's son in the miltary .. gunner on a black hawk over there right now  I think its about more than oil  I think 911 helped send the economy in the tank and the culture of its ok to tell a big un (as enron and all the accounts have done )..ie I did not have sex with that woman ,, and it depends on what is is ...    I think our police have better things to do right now than lift misguided kids into policwe vans right now during this week while we are at war .. but any other time i think it s ok .. I think the people of Iraq will welcome freedom  I think our miltary only want's to take out miltiary instalations and people who want to kill us unlike the 9-11 cowards and other act's by the terriorist  i like meat  I go to sunday school (that makes me an infidel i guess) and i dont want to kill anyone else who dont or even wants to go somewhere other than where i go  I know martin sheen only plays the pres on tv (pissss he really aint ), maybe when they cant haver the Oscars it will wake them up out on the left coast .. I think delay will only make it worst and wish we had done this sooner and there are a few more countrys who support terriorst acts against us that we need to get next... I dont think all that makes me a bad american  i think i have kids i want to see grow up safe  I think they wanted a war well they got it .. i think the world allready hates us and the middle east is already a mess that we cant make any worst by taking out one madman who's hero and he has tried to model himself after ...is  Joe Stalin   hows that bill? better?... let the throat going after begin ..

The primary sponsers were Ford Motors, Hewlett Packard, Pepsi, Best Buy, Budweiser, and Head and Shoulders. But among the local sponsers was our freinds at the Casbah.  Burt's commercial featured none other than Brian and the Nightmares, with shots of The Pleztones as well. It was the irony of this moment that has left me woozey,,, as Scott and Kurt were two of my earliest supporters in this crusade (I figure if  Bush can go on a crusade then so can Lynard Skynard supporters) Any way, I urge everyone to contact those corperations and ask them to support the Lynard Skynard induction movement.... I just don't know what to say in regards to the irony of the commercial I saw during the show, and those of you who know me know how seldom I am at a loss for words... the last time was during the Poverty Ranch days if I recall correctly.    By the way Brook, what's up with the archives?

      A Letter to George W. Bush on the Eve of War By Michael Moore, MichaelMoore.com March 17, 2003  George W. Bush 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington, DC  Dear Governor Bush:  So today is what you call "the moment of truth," the day that "France and the rest of world have to show their cards on the table." I'm glad to hear that this day has finally arrived. Because, I gotta tell ya, having survived 440 days of your lying and conniving, I wasn't sure if I could take much more. So I'm glad to hear that today is Truth Day, 'cause I got a few truths I would like to share with you:  1. There is virtually NO ONE in America (talk radio nutters and Fox News aside) who is gung-ho to go to war. Trust me on this one. Walk out of the White House and on to any street in America and try to find five people who are PASSIONATE about wanting to kill Iraqis. YOU WON'T FIND THEM! Why? 'Cause NO Iraqis have ever come here and killed any of us! No Iraqi has even threatened to do that. You see, this is how we average Americans think: If a certain so-and-so is not perceived as a threat to our lives, then, believe it or not, we don't want to kill him! Funny how that works!  2. The majority of Americans – the ones who never elected you – are not fooled by your weapons of mass distraction. We know what the real issues are that affect our daily lives – and none of them begin with I or end in Q. Here's what threatens us: two and a half million jobs lost since you took office, the stock market having become a cruel joke, no one knowing if their retirement funds are going to be there, gas now costs almost two dollars – the list goes on and on. Bombing Iraq will not make any of this go away. Only you need to go away for things to improve.  3. As Bill Maher said last week, how bad do you have to suck to lose a popularity contest with Saddam Hussein? The whole world is against you, Mr. Bush. Count your fellow Americans among them.  4. The Pope has said this war is wrong, that it is a SIN. The Pope! But even worse, the Dixie Chicks have now come out against you! How bad does it have to get before you realize that you are an army of one on this war? Of course, this is a war you personally won't have to fight. Just like when you went AWOL while the poor were shipped to Vietnam in your place.  5. Of the 535 members of Congress, only ONE (Sen. Johnson of South Dakota) has an enlisted son or daughter in the armed forces! If you really want to stand up for America, please send your twin daughters over to Kuwait right now and let them don their chemical warfare suits. And let's see every member of Congress with a child of military age also sacrifice their kids for this war effort. What's that you say? You don't THINK so? Well, hey, guess what – we don't think so either!  6. Finally, we love France. Yes, they have pulled some royal screw-ups. Yes, some of them can be pretty damn annoying. But have you forgotten we wouldn't even have this country known as America if it weren't for the French? That it was their help in the Revolutionary War that won it for us? That our greatest thinkers and founding fathers – Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, etc. – spent many years in Paris where they refined the concepts that lead to our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution? That it was France who gave us our Statue of Liberty, a Frenchman who built the Chevrolet, and a pair of French brothers who invented the movies? And now they are doing what only a good friend can do – tell you the truth about yourself, straight, no b.s. Quit pissing on the French and thank them for getting it right for once. You know, you really should have traveled more (like once) before you took over. Your ignorance of the world has not only made you look stupid, it has painted you into a corner you can't get out of.  Well, cheer up – there IS good news. If you do go through with this war, more than likely it will be over soon because I'm guessing there aren't a lot of Iraqis willing to lay down their lives to protect Saddam Hussein. After you "win" the war, you will enjoy a huge bump in the popularity polls as everyone loves a winner – and who doesn't like to see a good ass-whoopin' every now and then (especially when it 's some third world ass!). So try your best to ride this victory all the way to next year's election. Of course, that's still a long ways away, so we'll all get to have a good hardy-har-har while we watch the economy sink even further down the toilet!  But, hey, who knows – maybe you'll find Osama a few days before the election! See, start thinking like THAT! Keep hope alive! Kill Iraqis – they got our oil!! Yours, Michael Moore

      Thanks, Julie. What's the skinny on the Tamara firing?  My topic for the week is Dick Cheney's attorney strong-arming whitehouse.org about its fictitious bio of Lynne and its FAKE presidential seal. Apparently parody laws don't cover you unless you make your disclaimers BIG enough to suit the powers that be. (You can read the text of Addington's letter on the website.) So y'all, buy a bumper sticker or something.

      Just wondering if anyone saw the  urlLink governor's speech  last nite.   He looked tired and unhealthy, but his speech was well delivered and fairly inspiring. The "family budget" metaphor brought it down to earth and went a long way to suggesting that we are all in this together.  It's strange how the Highway Fund isn't playing a major role in the new budget. During the tax protests, all the tax-revolters would have you believe the Highway Fund was the ultimate budget-patch. It's only amounting to 19 percent ($66 million) of the total cuts. Fifty-eight percent ($207 million) is coming from Departmental Cuts, with the lion's share coming from Higher Education ($102 million). None of these numbers mean very much to me though. It's all theoretical until people start losing their jobs. There's a strange vibe though, that state jobs aren't "real" jobs, like in private corporations.   I wonder how Sundquist's administration is going to go down in the history books. In addition to the budget mess and the tax fiasco it looks like he's in pretty deep doo-doo for  urlLink old-fashioned back room deals .   It seems to me that he got to the end of his term and just went ape-shit, playing golf and ignoring the state's business. I find it ironic that it takes a democrat to clean up the budget mess created by a republican -- but when you think about it, that's what Clinton had to do. I guess we'll also have to wait for a democrat to fix the economic problems caused by the Bush administration -- unless, of course, the war fixes everything. That'd be great. It really sucks waiting for that to happen, though. I'm tired of hearing there's a "hiring freeze," until the economy is more stable. I'm tired of property values dropping. I'm tired of gas prices going up. I can't wait until Bush wins this war and everything is all better like when a democrat was president.

      Uh-oh. It would appear the rough-and-tumble nature of some of my recent posts has caused some concern in the house of blog. I don't think much of what I said was all that inflammatory, but some of it was pretty sharply pointed, I guess. If I drew blood on any innocent bystanders, just email me and we'll work it out...I don't find the comments sections to be a very workable solution, as people have to dig for your replies to top-level posts. By the same token, if anybody's really in the dark about what my point was to Coker, I'll explain it to you, but unless I hear otherwise, I'll trust that most of you got it.

       Bill:  You gotta admit is was a little reminiscent of "Do you still beat your wife" but I certainly accept that it was unintended.  As to being called down by Brook, I took that as a general admonishment.  If it was directed at me then I protest.  Check the record.  I did not make personal comments to or about anyone unless snide or insulting comments were made to or about me.  And that includes Brook.    Remember telling wedding quests that we were Church Security and talking into our chrysanthemums?

      Tony: I was not linking the shootings and bombings to your writings, and apologize for any confusion there, I was merely pointing out that the orignal reason for linking RICO to the anti abortion movement was not an effort to subdue peaceful protest, but the interstate organization of those crackpots that use violence in the name of God. The impetus to use RICO came, as I recall, from that group of wackos that were publishing dead or alive posters with pictures of Doctors on them. One of those Dr.s was among those shot, and of course Rudolph was linked to the abortion clinic bombings prior to the Atlanta bombing,,,,,,  That being said, being called down by Brook on a blog is almost, but not quite, as cool as getting called down by a Priest at Vicki's wedding (which is still the coolest story not yet told on the blog)  On a side note, at various "turning point" times in human history there have been increased reports of UFO activity, Roswell and the H-Bomb being just one of many examples. Has anyone besides me heard of encounters in the southeast since last fall?

      Bobby: Thanks for the info.  I did have the two confused.   The net effect of this is still that a particular political group faces felony charges for engaging in non-violent civil disobedience.  In my original blog I expressed a general impression that democrats, who have long used civil disobedience as a tool to address their political concerns, were largely unconcerned and mostly supportive of this law.  I question the constitutionality based on the principal of "fair and equal treatment" under the law.  And I don't consider the ACLU to be anything; they defend everyone's civil rights regardless of political belief.  Bill: You are right.  A woman seeking an abortion does, by law, have a right to be unimpeded.  However, your attempt to link bombings and shootings to my writing is still despicable.  Everthing I have written clearly concerned non-violent civil disobedience.    Elizabeth: Since you were offering up Brook's TBI story as evidence of "protest quashing" (it clearly is not) I did assume that perhaps you did not fully understand the meaning and weight of the word.  If you did understand, then why did you cite as evidence something that doesn't even vaquely resemble the definition?  As to your requirement that it is incumbent upon me to prove that a legally gathered protest group has not been quashed I must again assume (sorry) that you don't fully grasp certain logical concepts.  It is impossible to prove a negative.  No one can prove that something didn't happen. This has been a fundamental principle of logic since the Greeks first started thinking about thinking.  An assertion has been made, using unambiguous terms, and I have asked for the evidence that supports it.  To date it has not been provided.

I opened up the discussion to include current events and political topics because we live in interesting times and as interesting people, we all have something to share. In the interest of preserving a place where everyone feels comfortable to have their voice heard, I'm asking, please, tone down the confrontational manner in your postings.   Everyone is welcome to share ideas, stories and rants. No one needs to be picking fights or cultivating an environment of hostility.  Example: riff all you want on a particular topic.

      Citing a lack of concern from liberals (presumably the ACLU) regarding RICO and transferring that to everyone on the blog is a stretch. I think it is a mistake to assume everyone's opinions are that easily known. I agree the RICO statute applying to abortion protests set a bad precedent. However, Bill is right to note that legal remedies were sought as a response to violence and threats of violence by abortion protestors. Bill is also correct that access to clinics cannot be blocked, and it has nothing to do with RICO, it's the  urlLink Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.   By the way, just noticed the Shazam is on Charter's Homedmade Jam tonight; that means it should rerun Sunday at 2:00 p.m. (I think). I saw them recently at Gatsbys. They were great, but it was a strange crowd there at Gatsbys. I'm starting to feel my age now; I kept wondering who all those half-naked youngsters were. Women wear more make up than days of yesteryear, and hair companies have somehow successfully marketed hair products to guys. Who would've  thought that? Anyway, the Shazam rocked!

      You know , this thing on the blog has been amusing for a time, but boredom is setting in with this megalomaniac just lashing out blindly at everyone, getting cheap mastabetory thrills out of all the negative attention and reinforcement that he seems to thrive upon. He has accused me of projecting what he assumes to be my issues on to him and he doesn't appreciate it. Hey, I just calls 'em as I see's em Slim. His petty attacks hurt no one, and I am just amused at his psuedointellectual oratories that just ramble and focus on nothing. I might suggest that he get's his own Blog spot and call it something like.... "The World as you  should  see it. I know who and what I am, being a rather self-actualized fellow ( surely he does remember Maslow, doesn't he?). Methinks he doth project too much. So let us all take pity on this wretched and traumatized inner-child that is very angry that someone did'nt love him enough or show him enough attention.

      Pardon me Tony, please allow me to  correct myself:   Well for one thing Tony, in your 3/1 post you say that a woman seeking an abortion has no  MORE right to be unimpeded in entering a clinic,,,, as a matter of fact, she does. Also you assume that the protestors are only impedeing those seeking abortions, actually they impede everybody trying to enter, and as pointed out by at least one other post, not everyone entering a womens clinic is going there for an abortion, Do you feel that women seeking mammography should be harassed by screaming and taunting republicans? And please don't tell me that does not happen. In 1988 the Tinglehoff crowd decided to lock hands and block a womens clinic in Bristol. As a result several were arrested and my office ended up supervising several of these folks. Now actually they were really nice, well meaning individuals and were a breeze to supervise. Just imagine the look on their faces when we told them that no abortions were scheduled on the day they were arrested (in fairness they had protested for several days.)  Also you refer to the target abortion protestors as "non-violent".... exactly how is setting off a bomb at Olympic Park in Atlanta, as abortion protestor Eric Rudolph did, a "non-violent "event?? Is the the "compassionate conservative" version of "non-violent?" Or how about the guy in New England currently on trial for shooting a women's clinic Doctor? Would you compare him with Martin Luther King???  How wrong did you need to be???   Feel better now???

That is despicable" T.Cecil.  When you put those two statements side by side, it's easy to see that T. Cecil has not picked up on one or two crucial details in his egomaniacal rantings.

      The rules of proof, Tony, require that for it to be credible, you must provide me with the means of looking up your information for myself. Brook did that by posting a link. You give me and your fellow bloggers no way to confirm what you have seen on tv. It's ancedotal. In other words, all you've said is, "Believe me, you guys, there's never been a story on this." By what objective yardstick would you have someone find this acceptable proof? All we could do is comb thru the C-Span archives, and you have quite a nerve if you expect us to do your research for you. We don't even have a way to quantify what your "alot of the time" watching amounts to. Presumably you don't sit in front of the tv with a chamber pot at your feet and someone schlepping your meals to you on a tray, so we know at the very least you might have missed something. The question of whether no tv coverage of protest quashing proves that no protest quashing has taken place will have to remain outside the scope of my discussion until you can at least figure out that until you offer credible, verifiable data to back up your point of view, it remains nothing more than just that. Which, by the way, seems to be what you're trying to accuse the rest of us of doing with statements like, "...the rhetoric in this blog...bears little or no resemblance to reality. "  And on a personal note, I refuse to have a dictionary quoted to me by anyone who cannot figure out how to properly use IT'S and ITS. Shooting fish in a barrel, indeed.

       Bill:  I did not say "a woman seeking an abortion has no right to be unimpeded".  If you can't quote me correctly, even when the words are written down for you, then this is going to be a long, repetitious haul.  I said "A woman seeking an abortion has no MORE right to be unharrassed or unimpeded" than anyone else in America.  We are on the verge of going to war with a country that assigns special rights to some and not to others.  We have already fought many wars to stop those who believe that some have special rights over others.  If that is the America you want to live in then look for me on the side fighting against your rebellion.  And as a matter of fact Bill, by law, she doesn't have any more right to be unharrassed or unimpeded than anyone else.  I guess you didn't read the part where I point out that the law has recently been overturned by the Supreme Court.  As to that last paragraph, you begin by regaling us with a story of "well meaning individuals" blockading an abortion clinic (clearly the type off non-violent civil disobedience I was defending in my blog) and suddenly your into bombings and shootings by criminals (not "protestors") in a pitiful attempt to portray what I wrote as something other than what it was.  That is despicable.    Elizabeth:  quash: to suppress or extinguish summarily and completely; to nullify, especially by judicial action.  One TBI officer asking questions at a rally does not even come close to 'quashing'.    But I do find your notion of proof intriguing.  Let me see.  How does one go about proving that something DIDN'T happen.  That's a bit of a puzzler.  How many examples of something not occurring must I accrue to constitute proof that it didn't?  I suppose I could identify in detail each of the non-quashings, where they didn't occur, the number of people not  arrested or disbanded, the number of police or national guard it took not to quash them...  Nah.  Did I say that this is like shooting fish in a barrel?  It's more like fish shooting themselves in a barrel.

      Re: strong claims requiring strong evidence. Let's just talk about credibility of evidence for now. So far we have one verifiable story from a major newspaper vs. "I watch C-Span all the time and they haven't shown me an incidence of 'x.'" How would you cite that as a reference, Tony? By my count, the score is Brook 1, T. Cecil 0. And that pretty much leaves you hoisted by your own petard.

      Well for one thing Tony, in your 3/1 post you say that a woman seeking an abortion has no right to be unimpeded in entering a clinic,,, as a matter of fact, she does. Also you assume that the protestors are only impedeing those seeking abortions, actually they impede everybody trying to enter, and as pointed out by at least one other post, not everyone entering a womens clinic is going there for an abortion, Do you feel that women seeking mammography should be harassed by screaming and taunting republicans? And please don't tell me that does not happen. In 1988 the Tinglehoff crowd decided to lock hands and block a womens clinic in Bristol. As a result several were arrested and my office ended up supervising several of these folks. Now actually they were really nice, well meaning individuals and were a breeze to supervise.  Just imagine the look on their faces when we told them that no abortions were scheduled on the day they were arrested (in fairness they had protested for several days.) Also you refer to the target abortion protestors as "non-violent".... exactly how is setting off a bomb at Olympic Park in Atlanta, as abortion protestor Eric Rudolph did,  a "non-violent "event?? Is the the "compassionate conservative" version of "non-violent?" Or how about the guy in New England currently on trial for shooting a women's clinic Doctor? Would you compare him with Martin Luther King? How wrong did you need to be???

      I'll break my own lunch table rule this  one final  time only to help poor T. Cecil - they seem to be doing wonderful things with Halcyon based drugs these days. Rampant paranoia and delusions of granduer do not become anyone. First step is admitting that you have a problem. Doing the same thing and expecting different results is ...umm, ..oh who am I kidding? Damn, I gotta shit.........

       Is that the best you can come up with, Brook:  one TBI agent asking questions at a rally?  Gotta give you credit for trying.  It is at least something tangible around which to form an opinion, even an unrealistic one.  Much better than the lame non-responses from  pretty much everybody else.  But it does not amount to protest quashing.  Strong claims require strong evidence.   Also, you might want to re-read my blog.  It had nothing to do with abortion or Bill Clinton.  It was about protests and the total lack of concern by the Left when a particular group of people were singled out for some extra special punishment for doing nothing more than was being done by PETA, Earth First and other Left Wing groups.  I believe I did a fair job of making all that clear.  Anything else you read into it came from you, not me.  Perhaps if you engaged more gray matter and less viscera...  Bill:  Show me one thing in my blog that was not true.  When you can't,  ask yourself why people refuse to adjust their mind-set when they are shown that their perceptions are wrong, or at least, wildly innacurate.

      I got a screw driver stuck in my neck once and, luckily, had it removed at a Planned Parenthood Clinic in Ithaca, New York. That's my response to the March 1st post.   Chris: I'm not much into boxing, but I really like Oscar de la Hoya (did I spell that right?) ---for reasons other than his boxing ability. My brothers really love to watch boxing. Back in the days of Mohammed Ali, I was a big fan. I liked his rhymes.

      In fairness Brook, it's T. Cecil, not Cecil T., and I debated responding to his posts because I figured it would only encourage him, but the T man is always good for an arguement, even when he is wrong and mislead by republican heathen ways,,,, and I think it is Fox News he is watching, not C-Span. And I note that Tony has never ever asked anyone to stop responding to his posts, even if you do have to occasionally point out that the truth will stand when the world is on fire. All that being said, he is still wrong.

      Personally, I didn't reply to Tony's post because his rouse of the imaginary "protest quashing" just seemed ham-fistedly inflammatory, in that old-man-been-drinking-in-the-basement-listening-to-the-G-Man-sort-of-way. But also, I thought it was Tony Black, which seemed so very much out of character, that I thought he might have lost his mind (sitting at home watching C-Span). It seemed like the nice thing to do not to call any more attention to it. Now that I know it's Cecil T sitting at home watching C-Span all day -- getting worked up about Clinton and protesters and abortions -- it all makes sense!

       Actually, I was wondering why my blog didn't attract more response.  Then it hit me.  I can see it now.  All of you rushing to the internet or local library to desperately search for any instance of protestors, permits in hand, being surrounded by swat teams wearing "Bomb Baghdad" buttons who herd the frightened and utterly passive citizens into the backs of paddy wagons to be hauled off into the night while one tiny protestor, her sweet face framed in the paddy wagon bars, bats her teary blue eyes toward Washington DC saying, "Why, George Bush?  Why?  Why are you quashing our protest? Why?"

You should have seen the original draft.  Your concept of  ' word-bomb'  is  right on the money, but I stand by my phrase.  By the way, doesn't my one word bomb pale in comparison to the minefield that is this Blog?  So far the only people who seem to have even understood what I wrote are you and Elizabeth.  She at least acknowledged that maybe there isn't any protest quashing going on out there.  The rest was a little rambling and hard to follow, but it was an effort to respond with something of substance rather than go off on a tangent or just cry "wolf".  I understand that people sometimes need to blow off steam, especially in a world filled with political tensions, but a lot of what I read in here (and elsewhere) seems to be just hot air.

"sunday school is child abuse". "jesus is coming: are you gonna spit or swallow?" no RICO issues now. attack. attack. use your freed'ems or loos'ems.  points further: you know you are a real anarchist in america if you are in prison.  cocks fight. roosters crow. hens crow if no roosters are around.  i'm not sure anyone who responded to Tony's March 1st post actually understood what he wrote.  any way, during the 1996 election cycle he told me he was a Libertine...

Also missing from the Rock Hall's self-made history: Bob Seger, Alice Cooper, Mitch Ryder, Iggy Pop with and without the Stooges, the MC5, Jack Scott, Cat Stevens, Carly Simon, Black Sabbath, The Guess Who, Blue Öyster Cult, Electric Light Orchestra, Yes, Chicago, the Moody Blues, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, Carla Thomas, Irma Thomas, Sonny and Cher, Jimmy Webb, Paul Revere and the Raiders, Three Dog Night, Leon Russell, Randy Newman, Gram Parsons, Genesis,  Lynyrd Skynyrd , Jethro Tull and Hall & Oates.

Things come and go, civilzations rise and fall, Dynasties collapse, and critters become extinct everyday. And so it goes with rooster fights and downtown areas of neglect. It could be worse Dink - It could be like Nashville and be taken over by Gaylord Entertainment, you could end up with a Planet Hollywood, a Nascar Cafe, and loft apartments that are just way the hell too expensive for anyone to live in. Then, 2 years later you can watch all that collapse as well.

        chris.    Wow, I forgot.  We now have in the United States a legal definition of "hate-speech" with attendant legal consequences.     For my assignment I present The Johnson City Blogger, unless of course "moron" and "ogre" are just endearing nick-names for George Bush.  I realize that this does not meet the legal defination of hate-speech, but the very existence of "legal hate-speech" means that they one day could.      Bill        First of all there are no "innumerable persons arrested in the United States" at Gitmo.  99.99 percent of them were brought over from Afghanistan as prisoners of war.  Of the few people arrested in the United States, most are suspected of being part of terrorists cells acting in the United States and are not US citizens.  I have seen only one instance of a United States citizen being held without access to his attorneys.  He is accused of traveling to the Middle East and trying to contact members of Al-Quida.  Maybe his civil rights are being violated.  Then again, maybe people are alive today because they are holding him for questioning.    As to your remarks concerning civil disobedience, you apparently didn’t understand a thing I said unless of course you support charging protesters with a felony, fining them six figures and giving them double digit jail terms for blocking a sidewalk or chaining themselves to a nuclear power-plant gate.

      Dave!!! It's true!!! A Wal-Mart Super Center is coming to Elizabethton!!! While there are some who oppose it, progress marchs on!!!! The great mystery of it all is why anyone would oppose a company that keep prices low and competes mainly with Sears, JC Penny, and Target, I guess some folks just are against anything that does not meet their boheimian standards, it is that sort of cultural eliteism that costs us democrats elections. I  don't know if they have Wal-Mart Super Centers in Sweeden, but I bet they wish they did!!!!  Tony, I would point out that there was never a story called "The Night Thoureu Spent Watching TV." One of the points of civil disobediance is getting arrested.... Ghandi and King both did jail time for thier beliefs. If the abortion protesters demonstrate, fine,,, but if they break the law in doing so, they should be arrested. If they organize across state lines in an effort to conspire to break the law, that falls under RICO, or should if the Supreme court interpreted the law as common sense says it should. Further, if anti-war prortesters, or Skynard fans, or the Fucking Prudes,  conspire across state lines in an effort to break the law, they should be eligible for RICO as well. (Wouldn't a Prudes reunion be AWESOME!!! Perhaps for the Grand Opening of the Elizabethton Wal-Mart Super Center!!!!) And regarding civil liberties, when will the Republican/Conservatives stand up for the constitution?? Doesn't article one state that Writs of Certori cannot be suspended? Then why are innumerable persons arrested in the United States being held without access to courts or attorneys in Gitmo? Does the Geneva Convention superceed the Constitution of the United States in the Conservative New World Order? I mean, if getting a hummer in the oval office is grounds for impeachment, you would think that wipeing your ass on the Constitution would......  Dink, as there is little commercial appeal for Moonshine,, have you considered an international beer festival? We could have celebrity judges, and open drinking in the streets!!! For judges we could get George Wendt, Woody Harrelson, and Jenna Jameson (I am not familier with her work, but am told she is an expert on head.)  Just imagine, a week of drinking beer in order to judge the best beers in the world, that is a plan I can support!

Here in BeelziBuckle all we have is the Bell Buckle Cafe - home of of the worst bluegrass imaginable! Look up their web site! But Good news! Not only are we getting a Super Wal-Mart this summer in nearby Shelbyville, but we got the regional distributing hub only 4 miles from here!

      Politics? Is that what it's come down to now? If that's all that's what all the grey matter is about now, then let me weigh in for a moment with a few musings from a guy who doesn't make politics a hobby. George W. is the most laughable character in Washington since Oliver North and George Sr. were jamming at the White House. And let us not forget that the George's have the most remarkable history of absolutly no economic growth in the country whatsoever. I have to agree with Elizabeth about Clinton being the better politician. I would've voted for him again. Liar! Sex fiend! Is that what you're thinking? Well so fucking what. I would not have cared in they had 2 lines of women going in to see him every day - he got the job done! And lord knows he's not the first one to occupy the White House with lovers, male and/or female, or used his position to grab every perk he could lay his hands on. I fault him only for having a jones for ugly women. The rest of it was between Hilery and himself. As for Saddam Hussien, what of him? He's not our problem. George W is the most dangerous man in the world today. I'll take Elwood Blues' view on the topic; "Let's throw out the archaic Marshall plan and stay at home for the next 10 years!" But if we MUST deal with Hussien, then hire the Mousaud to go in first and then back the Israeli Army, the undisputed Badasses of the World, to handle the mop up operation. It's more economical than a head first illegal invasion on our part.  I make NO apologies for the spelling! Damn!

      That's a good question, Brook. Impossible to answer, but a daggone good quesion no less. My thoughts are the beginning bands need something to imitate that both sounds cool and is relatively easy to play so you don't get too discouraged. It amazes me to see even adults trying to play who can't figure this simple rule out: if it's a professional band playing a difficult song in a studio that you're trying to imitate, you and your friends who can't play for beans at this point won't be able to pull it off at all, and you'll get discouraged, so keep it simple. So, y'know, you might wanna go with The Ramones, AC/DC, Chuck Berry, Nirvana, and such. But the hard truth is that you're gonna sound like crap imitating that stuff, too, at first. So, do it for a while. Imitate anything you want for a while. Then (and this is true with anyone I've ever known who got good at playing with other people) very early on, give up trying to play other people's songs. Just write your own, no matter how simple and bad they are. Play 'em your way, whatever that is, but try to gradually incorporate some more and more complex elements of style from people that you hear. But the thing is, if these kids are really enjoying it and really wanna learn to play, they'll figure that out for themselves. We all did back in the day. It was a survival technique, writing all those songs. I just wanted something for us to play. But definitely, you can't get anywhere until you learn something about basic blues rock patterns, so thus I'd say number 1, get 'em a Chuck Berry CD. The Great 28 oughta do it. And you won't get anywhere until you learn something about locking together as a solid rhythmic unit (especially bass and drums), so get 'em an AC/DC cd, not Back in Black but I'd say Powerage or High Voltage. And after you've learned something about basic blues patterns and solid rhythm, you'll want something to aspire to, something which uses all of that to some degree but goes beyond it and gives you something to shoot for, so give 'em The White Album. Lots of songs on that one. Some simple enough to play. Some head shakingly complex.  There you go.

      Well, duh...Amazing what a little time and sleep will do. Didn't Lenny Kaye already do most of this work for us? Turn him on to the Nuggets stuff, at least the first couple of volumes. And as much of the commentary as you can get him to read. Twenty years on, it's still about as fucking salient as you can get. So now I'd say, let that stand for the 60's and 70's, The Cramps for the 80's, and the whole lo-fi thing from the 90's, The Vaselines, The Flaming Lips, Guided By Voices...

      I just remembered something---a friend of mine, former co-worker who is like a little sister,  23 years old, was telling me about the music she listens to---The Old '97s, Beck, etc., and we were hanging out at my place, and I showed her some old LP's, of the Kinks, and the Ramones--------she had never heard of them before. I was sad for a week.

      first of all a website for garage rock:  http://www.littlestevensundergroundgarage.com/play/archive.html   my choices (in no particular order):  Rolling Stones - Big Hits (High Tides and Green Grass) The Ventures - Walk Don't Run (the best of The Ventures) B52s first album (although someone will have to explain Ricky Wilson's whacked 5 string tuning).  Mix well....season to taste

      I would suggest burning 3 cds' worth of individual tracks. For a true crash course that seems a lot more reasonable. More effort, I guess, but probably less money? That said, I think I'm saying:  1. Patti Smith- Horses 2. You Really Got Me-era Kinks 3. The Sweet, circa 1975 tied with The Knack, circa 1979  I'm assuming that you want him to understand that the goal is to make music that makes people want to kick holes in the wall...from a sheer frenzy of joy. And I imagine he's probably heard "Rock&Roll Pt. 1" since that's been bastardized by the sports world, but try to put it into context for him, poor soul.  Now, I'm positive this list will help generate the kind of climate some have missed on this here blog, but take the pepsi challenge: take everybody's list, eliminate the duplications, and play 'em three at a time against each other, try to imagine being fifteen again, and ask yourself, if you were on the verge of committing suicide, if you had the gun to your head, which three discs would stay your hand? Those would be the three I'd send him.

      For those you may have ended up at this site as a result of a word search involving country music lyrics,,,   THERE ARE NO TRUCK STOPS IN JOHNSON CITY, TENNESSEE. THE NEAREST ONE IS ABOUT 35 MILES AWAY. Thank you for your time and attention to this public service announcement.  Now Brook onto your problem, London Calling is a good choice but would not make my top 3 list. I would suggest any two of the pre- Phil Spector Ramones (prior to End of the Century) and the Sex Pistols Never Mind The Bollocks. Three is a short list to choose from though,,, any of our regular readers could suggest a hundred more, and all would make  good additions,,,, somewhere on my list would be a couple of Led Zepp albums (a band that now puts me to sleep) and Who's Next (my choice for best album ever!) Oddly enough, most of my list for albums every rock and roll picker should be familier with would include a bunch that I never listen to anymore,

Ozzy, ac/dc, stooges, ELO -- what would you send to a kid who is embarking on his first voyage into garage band-land?

      Here's another post delivered straight to my Hotmail account.... I present Sindy Byrd... Now Syntha Lorenz. She really is a psychotherapist now!  __________________________________________  Hi there everyone,  Fomerly Sindy, the bar maiden currently Syntha, the psychotherapist.  The illustrious Elizabeth, upon a recent visit to San Franscisco, informed me of the website.  I caught up this morning skimming the archives. "The fat guy that used to play bass for the Dusters" name is Dave.  Sam is Bert's brother.  Bert chose his name when he arrived here in US after Bert Reynolds.   What a trip down the old memory lane, some pleasant and some downright painful memories all rose to the surface.  Yesterday I saw the movie, "Laurel Canyon" it's an appropriate precursor to sending a story in today. It's a must see for reminiscing the rock and roll lifestyle.  I have many many great stories, all of which are remembered sketchily due to my altered stated of consciousness.  For me though, there were years of fun in the height of the JC scene.  I think I arrived, via my childhood girlfriend Ann, as things really started to take off.  Todd moved to JC from Nashville with his blonde girlfriend Janet, his address book, and connections to other bands.  I think he helped our small scene grow by bringing in all those great bands. Do you guys remember Government Cheese, or that Goth band from Nashville with the bald bass player.  I'll think of the name later.  Stinky Finger in their early days with Johnny Rotten, What ever happened to him?    OK, which story shall I tell?  It could be about the dentist who funded the Highlander days or one of the many great Heather stories, including the one where we go-go danced on the stacks for a Nightmares show.  However, I am sworn to the girlfriend code of silence and would only reveal if all parties are in agreement.  I could tell one involving a devilish deb and a sound guy with their pants off just as the girlfriend broke down the door and took the boyfriend on a death ride.  Due to the nature of the material, I think I should contemplate the stories.  You know how the bartender can see too much.  syntha

      sometimes i get posts sent straight to my hotmail account.... here's one from Russ Onks.  ________________________________  Saw the continuing list of old bands from back in the day. My 2 cents:  The Velt - (Kay Why FRY CHI?) Vernon Reed doesnt have that pull now.  Manray - Athensy band  Chapter Two - (surely mentioned before) The most damned infectious groove, pop, skabilly band to give me tingly feelings ( IF anyone has any of there stuff recorded let me know please)  63 Eyes - the Kings of it all. (Dose-Nitos-Eyesing) James, Drew and Myself , dosed, with about a gross of Whippets and the Eyes at the Highlander. Brian Releva Sucking my jacket all night long?  Snatches of Pink - Stoned Stones stuff (Sara the drummer was cool)  five-eight - Good guys but my mom bared them from the house.  The Roosevelts - bared with five-eight (Sorry guys)  DEFPOTEC - at the Pub Out back grande opening... that was scary. Frat boys loved us ( Millworker Younquist ROCKS)  and who can forget the night at the Highlander that Barbara and Brook presented "800 lab rodents run wild in her wet nun poon." (Todd should have gaurded those letters better) -- [editor's note... this refers to rearranging letters on the Highlander sign... nothing more, I swear!]  Ok that's all i can do for now Im spent. Hope that helped.

      I don't know who the owners of the Otter are now, but I hear strange stories about them, the truth of which I haven't a clue. They have bands play in the back and on the patio, and they've renovated the upstairs with an extra bar up there and pool tables. This Saturday, the band Tonic is playing---$7 to get in. The college crowd gets a little annoying to me too, mainly because the acoustics in there are shitty. Jimmy Constable still bartends there. They still brew beer, but at the grand opening I heard they didn't have any brewed yet. Ahh Johnson City. I just hope they still make their black bean quesadillas. Does anyone know what happened to a Nashville band, the Billygoats? They used to play at the Otter and Down Home, but I haven't heard anything about them in over a year.

      I tried to go to the Otter a few weeks back, for its grand re-opening (I think.) Ridiculous. Trust-fund college babies as far as the eye could see. I couldn't get waited on. After 10 minutes, I left. I think there was beer there.

      Dammit, I missed the free beer. I really planned to come down there, Scott, but I got sucked into watching NCAA basketball, Texas v. Syracuse. Man. If Syracuse takes the championship, I'm gonna be one happy woman. Could mean some cash for me. And I have to confess, I'm in love with Carmelo Anthony. Totally.  Another confession: I like the song Hot in Herre (that's how it's spelled) by Nelly. Please don't kick me off this blog. He's hot too. O.K., I won't say any more. I wish I knew more J.C. stories, but my memories are more like snapshots---from staring at someone's shoes to sitting at a party at someone's house I don't know, etc. I think I was really shallow back then. Gosh, I've evolved so much :). (that's a joke) I'm working on another poem though. I fucked up the envoy on the last one, the 3 line stanza at the end, so if Doug Powell read it I'm embarrassed.

I need rock, and the Shazam is one fine "rock and roll outfit."  I click here occasionally to look for old JC stories, but nobody's telling any. Have we quit doing that? I hope not. There's more to tell. C'mon, people, tell me a funny story. I could use one about now.   Ok, that's it. Now get your butts to the Casbah tonight. One free beer on the Plez for anybody who comes and mentions this ad.

      Apparently the main problem with "The Brown Bunny" is that it's considered quite tedious except for the sex. What's wrong with the sex is that you see a penis (most certainly a prosthetic stand in.) BUT STILL!!! So it goes. By sheer volumn, I'm sure more has been written in the press about the depiction of this act than "Irreversible's" rape scene and "Breaking the Waves" put together. What's interesting to me is that neither of these brutal films, although controversial, ever reached the pitch of scandal Gallo achieved through a scene, that from all I am able to gather, featured neither violence or nor coercion. It's a strange world we live in.

      I haven't heard about Vincent Gallo's "Brown Bunny" or any controversy. Hugely ironic that Europeans, especially the French, would be opposed to fellatio on film. I'll have to check it out. And Meg Ryan was on the jury of judges at Cannes? Also ironic.   I saw the "I'm really gonna lose my shit" look on Winona Ryder's face when Angelina Jolie got the Oscar for "Girl Interrupted". She hasn't been the same since. And I didn't even think Angelina deserved that award---have never liked her acting, or personality, that much.  The last movie I saw was "The Shipping News" with Kevin Spacey and Judi Dench. It was really great, though of course not as good as the book by E. Annie Proulx, which I encourage everyone to read. Mentioning Judi Dench reminds me that I saw an interview with Madonna when she was performing in some play at the London Theater (I think it was on Bravo), and she said  the sign on her dressing room door said "Judi Fucking Dench", which I thought was hilarious.   Will have to check out those movies you mentioned, Tony, but "Harold and Maude" is one of my all-time favorites. Totally life-affirming.

      Movies...Anybody heard about the shit-storm at Cannes over Vincent Gallo's "Brown Bunny?" Seems those legendary European purveyors of cinematic sexuality are aghast because there's fellatio in it. Oh dear, oh dear...And of course what the American press has done with the story has been completely inaccurate as far as I can tell; I watched the press conference too and Chloe Sevigny did not appear to me to show "increasing distaste for Gallo's remarks," nor did he brag about firing Winona Ryder. He DID say she was too tanked on some kind of pill to work, which clearly was breaking some It-Girls club code of silence and made a lot of the press corps visibly nervous. Oh yeah, and Meg Ryan was sitting on his jury. So now his movie's being called "possibly the worst film ever shown at Cannes." (I'd like to see a list...Wasn't "The Night Porter" shown there, too?) It's like having your horse shot out from under you at the starting gate- twice, because he got robbed with "Buffalo '66," too. NOW I've got something to be mad at the French about.

I dont recall it coming up in past posts on this site, but since it is in the same time warp vein as much of the "memory lane waltzing" we do, i wondered what others thought. For me, it's as acurate, absurd and self-absorbed as anything else, circa the later day 70's to medium 80's. and funny as hell.  i also saw "holes" with a bunch of kids in chicago and thought it was a hoot. it was better than any kid's movies i remember seeing as a kid, except for maybe "harold and maude" which i have been told since, isnt a kid's movie at all...

      You know, Lisa, I'd totally forgotten that Donnie's dad was in the Geography Dept. For some reason, I had this idea that he was in the Math dept. I always thought that, from the time I was a kid. Sorry, Donnie. I hope they're still able to get a lot of info on the fossil site in Gray, which is really fascinating.  Have not seen either the "24-hour party people" movie or "holes". The last movie I saw that I loved was "catch me if you can" with Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hanks---a film about Frank Abignale, a big con-man in the 60's who now works for the FBI. I don't find Tom Hanks very believable in most roles, but he was really great, I thought. Am really looking forward to seeing The Matrix Reloaded. Maybe we should all recommend our top 3 movies for Brook's friend in Florida.

      yarrgh! me mates, read the fine print:  ETSU Athletics Vision Statement  East Tennessee State University Athletics Vision Statement East Tennessee State University department of athletics will be recognized nationally as a program of excellence through its broad-based athletic and academic success at the Division I level.  Mission Statement The department of athletics will assist the university in becoming the best regional university in the country by developing a culture of excellence and creating a forum for celebrating the university's advancement, enhancing its image with prospective students and building relationships and pride among its students, faculty, alumni, and community.  The department of athletics strives for excellence as it develops the leadership capabilities of student-athletes in an environment that unites achievement in intercollegiate athletics competition with academic excellence, sportsmanship, and community service within the educational and social environment of East Tennessee State University.  Core Values  E - Excellence and Education: We believe that no goal exceeds the mandate to educate and graduate the student-athlete and that we are first and foremost educators. We believe in a culture of excellence where each individual is expected to adopt a results-oriented proactive work ethic.  T - Teamwork and Trust: We value each member of our athletics family and understand the importance of teamwork and treating each individual honestly with dignity and respect. We believe in an environment of mutual trust. Making commitments generates hope and keeping commitments generates trust, and with trust comes benefit of the doubt. We believe in helping each other grow professionally.  S - Success: We value winning and achievement in athletics, academics, and personal and professional development while complying within the rules and regulations of the NCAA.  U - Understanding: We value and respect diversity of people and thought and are committed to providing an environment where all student-athletes and staff are free from harassment and intimidation.   but of course, no one really cares why they called themselves buccaneers,  swashbucklingoneyedearringwearingmustachemen... maybe it sounded good to change the image of east tennessee womens teacher college?a

      Giant fake objects...perfect symbolism for giant fake programs inside. The mini dome has been entirely given over to the athletics program (apparently there are still sweaty jock-types running around post-football excision) except for Ditty's lab. That's right, the former Ms. Hagardorn is braving it almost solo except for a handful of other toxicologists in the last outpost of the Medical School still left in the mini dome, all other departments having been moved to "Valhalla 2" some time ago. She tells me the athletes think the eye wash station is a water fountain. I look for some experimentation to occur on these sub-rat creatures in the near future. Resources are scarce and "waste not, want not" should be the new watch words for every college department. And wasn't Donnie's dad practically the whole Geology department?

      Did not see the governor's speech but did read about it. Lots to deal with. Once you start talking over 50 or so dollars, it's not money you buy stuff with anymore; it's a confusing animal. As to the war, Jessica Lange was on Letterman last night and was awesome in expressing her views. She is SO cool. Her best comment was, "I don't recall any tenet in the Constitution that says that a quality of being American should be the desire to wage war. I'm tired of this attitude that supporting peace is somehow synonymous with being unpatriotic." (not exact words)  Lisa: your point was well expressed, in my opinion.

      Sounds Great Dave!!!! and by the way, for those that may be curious,,,, the gross national product of Sweeden, according to the CIA factbook (yes there is such a thing, and you can get to it online) is $219,000,000,000, where as the annual revenues generated by Wal-mart, according to the online edition of their annual report for 2002, is a mere $26,000,000,000, less than 1/7th the GNP of Sweeden!!!!!  Now Dave, about that Paganpalooza thing, could that be done in conjunction with a Hindu Rib Roast (Middle Tennessee Edition)?????

      To relieve Dave's Dave's trepidations concerning the stories in johnson city stories:  To continue with the HRR stories, the last one I recall was when my girlfriend at the time got upset because ther were too many of my ex's on the dock( she was of the opinion that once you broke up, you shouldn't be friends, I guess). She decided to run away and I decided to stay. But anyway, scot hinson and I found a rowboat and decided to go out for a trek into the lake. He used to be a sea scout back in High School, so I trusted him even tho we were both so deep in cups that neither could see straight. We visited, partook and were subsequently released from several parties that were going on along the shore. I remember vaguely being physically being placed in our boat while asking if anyone had a dry cigarette. Surprisingly got one. Scot and I left the group of fun people who figured us out (4th party we hit, they were the only ones who disconered we didn't belong.....free beer and smokes from the rest). Suddenly, we found ourselves asea without our GPS....completely lost, in the middle of Boone Fucking Lake, in a rowboat, and with one dry cigarette. Starting to panic, scot decides that I need to learn how to be a sea scout too. Luckily I was saved from this odious task by one T. Cecil Coker. As Scot was teaching me the mechanics of rowing, Tony just popped out of the water on our starboard (aft, flank, hell....I don't know) side. We were miles from the camp, and Tony guided us back to our party. If T. Cecil is still posting, How the Fuck did you find us and what werer you doing swimming out that far?

      Everyone:  Johnson City Public Library  is facing drastic cuts in funding this fiscal go-round. The library has been stagnate in funding for the past 3 or 4 years, so these cuts would have a profound negative impact on library services. Due to a state law called "maintenance of effort," the library would lose access to its online regional catalog system in the event of the cut. It seems the current mayor of Johnson City really has it out for the library. The  Johnson City Press  is conducting a poll right now about whether the library should sustain deep cuts: the more No votes that it gets the better, so please vote No if you get a chance.

      I have come to the conclusion that during the 1980’s and 1990’s Quarterbacks was a focal point of UFO activity. Researchers report that one of the most common post abduction effects is that of lost time. During the 1980’s and 1990’s I personally went to Quarterbacks on what seems like 2 or 3 occasions, yet while I recall getting there at 6 or 7pm, I remember deciding that I should leave at 2 or 3am. I am at a loss to recall much of the time I was there, or why I decided to leave, if in fact I decided of my own accord to do so. After much meditation on this, I can only deduce that the lost time effect is in play, leading to my hypothisis of alien abduction. I wonder if anyone else has encountered this. If so, it would be helpful if you would post your recollections, or lack there of, here so that this can be fully explored.

      Will have to check out that book and the C-Span show. Oh--more additions to recommended music for Brook's 15-year-old friend. This from one of my brothers, Ben---Santana's "Aabaraxia", and from another brother, Tim, the DVD of the Eagle's "When Hell Freezes Over". My oldest sibling, Sam, said "anything by Merle Haggard".  Scott Pleasant applied for a reporting job where I work, the Elizabethton Star---still a small family-owned newspaper, which are disappearing. The owner, Frank Robinson, who's 79, still comes in every day, and freely uses descriptive language such as "that SOB". He's deaf as a post and a "man's man". I enjoy it here. Beats the hell out of media general.

      Hello everyone. It's funny; I read the blog, and then I'm bombarded with all these thoughts about the past, etc. - this stream-of-consciousness stuff, and I think, my God, I need to post this. (happens usually at night). Then, the next morning, it's lost, and, besides, it seems pointless. Don't know where I'm headed with this.  My entrance into the Johnson City music scene came by way of being 8 years old, when I first entered University School. While I was a student there, I met Mark, Donnie, John Smith, Kurt, Scott Plez, and others who later became a part of that "other world". It's really weird, knowing people for that long. There is an odd sort of innocence that gets preserved, so that the lense through which I see those people, and the stuff they/we were a part of, is still attached to little things like Kung Fu lunch boxes and learning multiplication tables. And decisions/perceptions about/of relationships were/are made differently because of that, even now.  I recently interviewed a school nurse in Carter County who is Hispanic for my job, and she explained to me the visible change in kids when they move from an elementary school environment to junior high. At University School, since it was a grade 1-12 school, transformation of the psychological kind happened differently, with this obvious innocence holding together an entrance into adolescence. In some ways, I think it was painful for us, or for me anyhow.   Oh dear. I fear I sound like a Judy Bloome novel.   More later.

      Picked up “Strays” yesterday. When I heard a few months ago that Bob Ezrin was producing, Im sure I just got all giddy. Ive always loved his huge, theatrical, pretentious -- often ridiculous approach to a record and couldnt wait to hear what he would do with the already larger than life and cosmically goofy Jane’s Addiction. I was equally apprehensive -- sometimes the Bob Ezrin touch can absolutely ruin what couldve been a good product, ie The Jayhawk’s 2000 release “Smile.” Sometimes it just doesnt work (and whoever suggested THAT collaboration shouldve been publicly flogged). Back on task: I immediately popped “Strays” into the CD player in the car for the drive home. MY GOD! “Here we go!” Chills ran down my spine, I was smiling and laughing the entire drive home -- it IS HUGE, theatrical, pretentious and yes, often ridiculous. And it fucking rocks. The record is joyous -- and as familiar as an old friend. This band is accutely aware of their iconic public stature -- playfully tossing around the alt/rock cliches they invented, referring to tunes past -- but never sounding dated or trite. And the RIFFS!!!! The Farrell/Navarro chemistry is as electric as it was thirteen years ago -- and in my opinion firmly cements their place in rock history among the great singer/guitarist pairings: Plant/Page, Scott/Young, Johannsen/Thunders, Mercury/May, Tyler/Perry, etc. Ive got my favorites: “True Nature” “Price I Pay” “Suffer Some” “Hypersonic” -- but there is really no weak tune on the disc. When the last song ended I felt kind of, I dont know... sad that is was over, I didnt want the experience of the first listen to end. I wanted more tunes. Do you know how long its been since Ive been able to say that about ANY record?   Also getting play in the car this week: Grand Funk’s 1969 release “Grand Funk Railroad” --  worth purchasing just to hear Mel’s amazing bass tone. If all you are familiar with from the Grank Funk catalog are tunes like “American Band” or “Locomotion” -- you’ve got a big surprise awaiting you. This is pure, raw, sloppy, dirty, blues drivin kick-ass rock and roll.

      It's a darn good thing they impeached Clinton for lying about getting a blow job,,, if they had not stopped him, next thing ya know, he would have lied about Al Queda and Iraq being connected, Iraqi weapons programs, Iraqi's trying to get uranium from Niger, or even that Iraq was not letting weapons inspectors into thier country. Who knows where this would have all led if Clinton had been allowed to lie that way! Remember kids, honesty is the best policy! If they let us put the 10 commandments on every public facade in America, you would know what the Bible says about bearing false witness against your neighbor.......

      Howdy y'all...I'm a little late getting this posted; I think it's already got to the call-yer-senators stage, but travel to the website. They've got a good thing goin' with this grassroots electronic democracy stuff...  The President took the nation to war based on his assertion that Iraq posed an imminent threat to our country.  Now the evidence that backed that assertion is falling apart.  I've joined over 330,000 other people in calling on Congress to investigate at MoveOn.org.  247 other people from our own Congressional district have already signed, but we're shooting for 350.  Please take a moment to help us get there by signing on at:  [url]http://www.moveon.org/wmdpledge/[/url]  If the Bush administration distorted intelligence or knowingly used false data to support the call to war, it would be an unprecedented deception.  Even if weapons are now found, it'll be difficult to justify pre-war language that indicated that the exact location of the weapons was known and that they were ready to deploy at a moment's notice.  With a crisis of credibility brewing abroad and the integrity of our President and our foreign policy on the line, we need answers now.  Please ask your Representative to pledge his or her support for an open investigation at:     http://www.moveon.org/wmdpledge/  A President may make no more important decision than whether or not to take a country to war.  If Bush and his officials deceived the American public to create support for the Iraq war, they need to be held accountable.  Thanks.

      Now to Brook's real point (as I see it)...I must say, with a little further reading of the Michael Wolf article, that the only part that seems grievous is not the wares Mr. Z has in his coat, but the price he is charging us for them. The niche-market strategy the American version of The Guardian plans to pursue is small readership, big subscription price. The problem with this is both pyschological and practical. It limits the availability of good-quality thinking to those who can afford to pay for it, implying that a mind is a luxury to have, and creates further antipathy between "elite liberals" and a mass that's already too ready to see themselves as anti-intellectual even without snobbery along class lines. If The Guardian's great freedom comes from its trust fund, which makes it relatively immune to advertising pressures, why is it necessary to stick it to its readers with the price tag? Why assume from the get-go that small price, large readership won't work just as well for The Guardian as for the tabloids, that poor people can't also be smart? Or at least that there aren't enough poor people who are smart enough to make such a venture competitive on the tabloid level? That strategy would disseminate the message much more widely and give a greater chance for real social and political change rather than just breeding more conflict and hostility.

      This is off the point of Brook's post a bit, but I can't help appreciating a certain amount of symmetry in the idea that since we got dumbed down by an Aussie, maybe we SHOULD be smartened up by a Brit (although ideally we ought to smarten up ourselves, which would help enormously in resisting dumbing down, wherever it comes from.) I just pulled these things randomly off the net, and rather liked the way they went together.  “I think a newspaper should be provocative, stir ’em up, but you can’t do that on television. It’s just not on.” ATTRIBUTION: Rupert Murdock, declaring that he did not plan any television tabloids, Business Week 20 May 85 (hmmmmmmm, the year he became a US citizen)  And these thoughts from Carl Bernstein, doing a keynote speaker gig at the 50th anniversary of Boston University's College of Communication (9/21/97)  Now, Bernstein argues, journalism has little to do with reality, truth or context. His accusation: journalists are out of touch, disfigured by gossip, celebrity worship, sensationalism and denial of our society about the real conditions.  "We're turning into a sewer," he said. "Our society is being handed over to the triumph of idiot culture," said Bernstein. "Make no mistake about who the most influential figure in journalism of the past quarter century is...it's not Ted Turner, the team from CBS or 60 Minutes, it's Rupert Murdock." It's time that the news media recognize that Rupert Murdock and "his sleazy standards at the low-end of his empire are increasingly affecting the standards of the high-end of our business, and are an even greater threat to the truth than the lying and the secrecy of the succession of American presidents and their governments," Bernstein charged. Bernstein questioned the leadership of the press saying, "The media are all squandering their power and abdicating their responsibility," while responsible journalists have welcomed the standards of the Murdock journalists instead of drawing the line.  And consider this:  On February 14, a Florida Appeals court ruled there is absolutely nothing illegal about lying, concealing or distorting information by a major press organization. The court reversed the $425,000 jury verdict in favor of journalist Jane Akre who charged she was pressured by Fox Television management and lawyers to air what she knew and documented to be false information. The ruling basically declares it is technically not against any law, rule, or regulation to deliberately lie or distort the news on a television broadcast.   On August 18, 2000, a six-person jury was unanimous in its conclusion that Akre was indeed fired for threatening to report the station's pressure to broadcast what jurors decided was "a false, distorted, or slanted" story about the widespread use of growth hormone in dairy cows. The court did not dispute the heart of Akre's claim, that Fox pressured her to broadcast a false story to protect the broadcaster from having to defend the truth in court, as well as suffer the ire of irate advertisers.   Fox argued from the first, and failed on three separate occasions, in front of three different judges, to have the case tossed out on the grounds there is no hard, fast, and written rule against deliberate distortion of the news. The attorneys for Fox, owned by media baron Rupert Murdock, argued the First Amendment gives broadcasters the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on the public airwaves.   In its six-page written decision, the Court of Appeals held that the Federal Communications Commission position against news distortion is only a "policy," not a promulgated law, rule, or regulation.  Fox aired a report after the ruling saying it was "totally vindicated" by the verdict.

      Every now and then the zeitgeist opens it's coat to show you the goods. When you see the wares Mr. Z is plying you say, "of course! I knew you would eventually have some of that!"   Ostensibly this is a long article about niche publishing -- but you know when you read it, it's you more than that. This is a culture clash. The brains against the brauns. It's the revenge of the nerds. And the most beautiful thing is that it is about foreigners using the most American of marketing axioms (charge more b/c the product is more "exclusive" -- it isn't for "everyone" -- HA -- which means EVERYONE who is anyone, will HAVE to have it on their coffee table!) as the weapon of choice to achieve success in the American market. It works for restaurants, it will work in publishing.  ______________________________________________  THE BRITISH ARE COMING -- AGAIN.   THE LAUNCH OF A U.S. EDITION OF THE UNABASHEDLY LIBERAL GUARDIAN MAY BE JUST WHAT THE BUSH-WHACKED U.S. PRESS NEEDS.  By Michael Wolff (New York, metro.com)  It was a daylong conference about the media’s role in the Iraq war, sponsored by the Guardian newspaper and held in its archive center—a newly refurbished building with café—across the street from the Guardian’s main building on Farringdon Road in London.  Everything about the conference seemed foreign—not just the self-critical nature of the conversation, but the bad air-conditioning and stifling temperature of the room. I tried to imagine such an event in New York or Washington—picking at the fresh scab of how we had covered the war—and what news organization would sponsor it. Of course, the real subject here—which so much of the U.S. media had closed ranks around—was the U.S. itself. That most massive of Bigfoots. Indeed, more and more, the foreign media had a distinct journalistic advantage over the U.S. media: Foreigners could go after the central story and openly dispute the Bush-administration message, whereas U.S. journalists were tied to the party line by a complicated emotional, social, political, and corporate etiquette.  In this respect—as a robust counterpoint to the American media—the Guardian (to which I sometimes contribute) had had a very good war. It became an almost-fashionable read on select U.S. campuses and in certain American liberal circles. Traffic on its Website, which has had a steadily growing American audience, climbed dramatically during the war. The electronic Guardian was the alternative press—if you were looking for one.  Still, when, during a coffee break, Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian’s editor, said to me, in a most offhanded way, “We’re coming to America,” I assumed he was talking about a personal visit.  “Well, let’s definitely get together,” I politely said.  “No,” he said. “We’re bringing the Guardian to America. We’re going to publish an American version.”  It struck me first that—even given the Guardian’s campus chic-ness—the U.S. has never been less receptive to the European point of view than it is now. By any measure, to be successful in the U.S. news business is to be staunch, patriotic, defensive. It’s Fox or bust. And it struck me even more forcefully that beyond the difficulties of liberalness, the prospects for literate media—the Guardian being a writer’s paper—were, as everybody knew, nil.  Then, during the next break in the conference, Rusbridger took me across the street to his office and showed me the prototype for the new American Guardian. Its tentative form is as a weekly magazine, quite unlike any other weekly magazine that has been started in the U.S. in the past generation. Not only is it about politics (Rusbridger is looking to launch in the winter to cover the presidential-primary season), but the magazine—meant to be 60 percent derived from the Guardian itself, with the rest to come from American contributors—has a great deal of text unbroken by design elements. This is almost an extreme notion. Quite the antithesis of what virtually every publishing professional would tell you is the key to popular and profitable publishing—having less to read, not more. Even with the Guardian’s signature sans-serif face, it looks like an old-fashioned magazine. Polemical. Written. Excessive. Contentious. Even long-winded.  This was either radically wrongheaded, or so forcefully and stylishly counterintuitive—and unexpected—that I found myself thinking, light-headedly, that it might define a turnaround in American publishing.  Bear with me. There is something here.  First, it’s important to understand the anomalous nature of the Guardian itself.  There may not be anything else quite like it in commercial publishing anywhere. The Guardian is the fruit of a legal trust whose sole purpose is the perpetuation of the Guardian. In other words, the trust—the Scott Trust, created in 1936 by the Manchester family that controlled the paper—eliminates the exact thing that has most bedeviled media companies: the demands of impatient shareholders and the ambitions of would-be mogul CEOs.  The Guardian, because of this flukish independence, occupies for well-bred left-wing Brits something like the position that the New York Times once held for Upper West Side liberals (or that Fox now holds for red-state anti-liberals): You cannot be who you are without it.  Young people even read it.  What’s more, under Rusbridger, it has become, along with the Daily Mail (with its lock on middle England) and the BBC’s morning news show, The Today Programme, among the most influential media voices in the UK.  The sudden turn in popular opinion against Tony Blair for the Iraq war and the anger at his government’s WMD misrepresentations—a development that George Bush has yet to face—have been led by the Guardian.  It is also the paper everybody wants to work for.  Rusbridger is a large, rumpled, Harry Potter–esque 49-year-old. He’s a Cambridge-educated, well-married, Establishment figure running an anti-Establishment newspaper. He’s dry, slightly mocking (he came to prominence in his early thirties writing a daily-diary column that, in classic English diary form, skewered the rich and pompous), and full of long silences. What’s more, despite the long pages of type, he’s a packaging genius.  “G2,” which he created when he was the Guardian’s features editor (Peter Preston, a Fleet Street eminence, was then the paper’s editor-in-chief), is a daily inside-the-paper tabloid section. But instead of this representing the tabloidizing of the Guardian, Rusbridger gentrified the tabloid. While the American evolutionary step has been to forsake hard news for soft—for instance, the Times’s and the Journal’s ever-expanding leisure, consumer, and service sections—the Guardian in “G2” has morphed headline news into a daily bath of stylish opinion, context, and narrative. It’s high-concept news. It’s story-behind-the-story news—which is, of course, the real story. It is not unlike the kind of magazine journalism that flourished in the U.S. a generation ago—before cableization and tabloidization and consolidation.  This is the marketing point: Unlike American packaging genius, which is about packaging down (resulting in the deterioration of taste as well as attention spans), Rusbridger packages up.  While I was standing in Rusbridger’s office and leafing through the prototype, thinking that this was novel and exotic—quixotic, even—and quite a profound misunderstanding of the American market, it suddenly occurred to me that I was overlooking the obvious. The Brit niche.  Against the background of the rise of Fox, the deification of tabloid queen Bonnie Fuller, and of the general decline of quality U.S. publishing, there’s been something of an exceptional, and profitable, highbrow British invasion. Arguably the two most successful print publications to be introduced during the past decade in the U.S. market are The Economist and the Financial Times. (The third is Maxim, also English in lineage, and a different packaging story.)  Both The Economist and the FT succeeded by pursuing the opposite strategy of almost every other U.S. publication: offering too much, rather than too little, information—and charging plenty for it.    urlLink the rest of the article is here... .

      As far as I'm concerned, with the Down Home, Johnson City has a way better music scene than Nashville. It's just more fun to go out there than it is here and finding a parking spot isn't a problem.  That said, ya'll should know that tomorrow, X (the whole original band) is playing and outdoor show (called the  urlLink Uptown Mix ) here in Nashville, with Jason and the Scorchers and The Fags. Price of admission? $5 bucks! Is that not just nuts? $5 bucks!  I'm just so excited I had to tell somebody... and isn't The Fags like the greatest name for a band? "Ladies and Gentleman... put your hands together... for THE FAGS! God, that cracks me up.  Another good Uptown Mix will be The Flaming Lips with The Eels, August 6.

      Hello blog... been a long time, but i have a medical excuse. i herniated 2 disks in my back, and then got a blood clot, and also had some kind of weird puking fever. i've been sick for a month. hospitalized twice. i could go on and on about the shitty state of healthcare, but i think i'm just going to say this: why can't you shop for a physician the way you would shop for any other service? a lawyer or a landscape designer.  i've gone to the same doc for 7 years. she was the newest kid on the block when i got my healthcare plan, ergo she was the next available doc, ergo that's who i was told to go by my insurance plan. i didn't know anything about her -- what she studied in school or even WHERE she went to school. it wasn't like i could check her out and then go check out another doc. it was like, be damn glad you have insurance and shut the hell up.   why is this? you'd think that people would really care about knowing everything they can about their healthcare providers. but just try to find anything out. i know way more about a car before i buy it... or about computer or audio equipment. you at least get the brochure or surf the website... look at the specs... compare features. jeez -- with doctors, people you rely on to keep you alive -- you are expected to just take the next one available. that's if you're lucky enough to have insurance.  you might be wondering what my doc did to piss me off so bad. it's not any one thing. it's a general state of bullshit. for instance, since this latest illness happened, she hasn't once conferred with me about what is wrong. she never said "this is what is wrong and this is what we are going to do." i've had to sleuth out my diagnosis -- and naturally i only have the most shallow (read: frightening) understanding of what it is. so... that pisses me off. every direct question i asked was met with a brush off.  here's another... how would you feel if you ask you doctor for help with pain management and they hand you a bag of samples and say, "i'm not sure what this is, but go ahead and take it and see what happens."  SEE WHAT HAPPENS! what the hell. let's not do that at all. lets find out what is in this medicine. lets see if it might interact with shit i'm already taking. i swear she gives out stuff from the sample cabinet b/c she's too busy to think about prescribing anything. LETS SEE WHAT HAPPENS! is this what healthcare has come to? are these people all on drugs?

      Hello everyone. I haven't posted or kept up for a while. Just thought I'd say hi and can't wait to see those of you who I'll be seeing soon. Also hi those of you who I'll be seeing "someday."  And even to those of you who I may never see again, sadly. Hell, even to those of you I've never met. Hi, everybody.  Anyway, I do have this one Johnson City memory that is worth telling. I wonder if it's been told already. Some six or seven of us were looking for something to do one night back in 1988. I don't remember what month, but I believe it was in the late Spring. Kurt Hagardorn had some Pabst Blue Ribbon in his fridge, and we went to get more. The idea was to sit under the overpass and drink it, sort of like a group of scary loser trench coat teenagers in some bad movie about youth angst and disaffection. Yep. So, we go drink the beer under the overpass, which turns out to pass time a lot less well than you might imagine. After maybe a half hour or so, we decide to get up and go to a minor league baseball game or something. I don't remember. Just some other idea, but I think it may have in fact been a J.C. Cardinals game we were headed to. Doesn't matter. Anyway, Lisa Williams was last to get up and start making her way back to the car. We didn't notice when she got up, she totally clonked her head on a concrete beam and wound up back down on the ground.   She didn't scream. She didn't cry. She did nothing to alert us to her distress. We kept walking. When we made daylight, we all sort of gathered up and noticed that Lisa was still back there on the ground. She wasn't passed out. Just holding her head and saying something like "That wasn't good" over and over.   Pabst and concrete don't go well together. I can report to you that Lisa made a full recovery, but not that evening. We broke apart and gave up on the other idea (baseball?) that we had in mind. I took my belly full of Pabst down to Quarterback's, where Bleu Jackson was playing. Would you believe that Mr. Jackson walked over to me that night and said, "Man, you are WILD with all that 'Italian Women' and 'Moonshine Still'. Totally wild." Do you think it's possible that the people who created the character of Boomhauer on King of the Hill modeled his speech patterns on those of Mr. Bleu Jackson? Just a thought. Love ya, Blue.  Again, nice to "see" all of you. As ever.

      I will say for "Mulholland Drive," I felt I understood Lynch's fascination with red curtains truly for the first time. Those heavy velvet drapes used to be standard issue on every auditorium stage in like, every school in America. Did anybody get through grade school without the experience of waiting behind those curtains at least once for some performance to begin? It's probably the first time most people have a really focused awareness of there being two worlds, one "out there" in anticipation of which one is breathless with fear and/or excitement, and one "in here" which is hidden and safe at least for the time being. I now think the red curtain motif is a direct visual referent for that precise moment not just of perception but of actual experience of two different, simultaneous realities.   Just yesterday, I was groovin' on my "March Hare." It's a small white plastic rabbit bobble-head with evil orange eyes. It was my birthday present from Barbara Herd this year. It is just the coolest thing that ever was. I have it stuck on the dashboard of my tiny white Metro, and it bobs along to whatever music I have on without ever missing a beat. People stare at it at intersections and cross themselves. I keep my pitch-dark glasses on and just snap my fingers off-tempo. What's really weird is that it came in the mail about a day after I saw "Donnie Darko," went to the "Donnie Darko" website and took the "Find out which Donnie Darko character you most resemble" quiz and the answer came back, "You're FRANK! Have a nice day!"

      most lynchian JC story...? great question... in a way i think David Lynch should come clean on his favorite Johnson City Story.  Did anyone else see Blue Velvet the ONE WEEK it played in the Goodies Clothing shopping centre theaterplex? What was that feeling? recognition... reflection? Lumberton WAS so easily Johnson City... the saturated colors and highly acceptable neighborhoods... sidewalks and creeps in muscle cars... crooked deals and smoky bars and never.... not once.... does anything beg for explanation. and that's okay because... look... a robin!  then, Twin Peaks! Does anyone remember the completely sincere excitement of watching Twin Peaks unfold every week on Friday night? John says the bass player from the Paralyzers claimed he was going to have to quit the band to watch the show... they broke up during the shows' run... who knows.   Twin Peaks dug deeper into Lynch's steamy pile of Meta Shit. The Black Lodge. Good and Evil. the Log Lady (Is it just me or did the Log Lady not totally remind you of Edie Patrick?). It's the metaphysical lynch that i think most closely resonates with Johnson City. What Lisa said about the murder at beauty spot when the flock of birds fell from the sky... all VERY Lynch... but the tastiest burnt kernel there is that a very similar murder had happened at Beauty Spot nearly twenty years prior... making the event seem ever more so fated or SCRIPTED to happen as if a hungry ghost was lured from his cave in the laurels by the smell of fresh betrayal. the unfortunate couple were supposedly having an affair. it's so lynch it's beyond lynch. oh god... it's uberlynch!  the mountains are moody, dangerous creatures and poppa eraserhead did a good job of exploring that theme without sounding lame. he got lucky, but he's not the genius i thought he was. wild at heart... lost highway... mullhulland drive... he's not even trying anymore. i think the early lynch would find something interesting to say about the Beauty Spot yarn... the post-twin peaks lynch would have to incorporate hot lesbian sex scenes into it to make it interesting for himself and anyone else. he's gotten old, sad and embarrassing. JC, on the other hand, despite the new, sad and embarrassing strip malls, is still quite noire. with or without hot lesbian sex.  there is one recent David Lynch production, "Rabbits." has anyone seen it? it sounds promising. Three people in bunny suits doing a staged one-act. But even if he's on to something Rabbit-suit themed, it's only because people in bunny suits have been blowing in the zeitgeist since Duncan's senior show which, i am convinced, is somehow responsible for the repetition of the image of grown people in bunny suits for the last ten years. if you haven't noticed it, you haven't been looking. people in bunny suits are EVERYWHERE. Donnie Darko... anyone see that? This is funny. I loaned that DVD to mr Relleva the week it came out which also happened to be easter weekend. after watching it, he says he was outside on his front porch looking down the row of perfectly aligned front porches and down a way... maybe 3 porches down, there was a full-grown person in a giant rabbit suit casually waving at him. sooooooo creepy!  when i was little my mother sewed a pink bunny costume for me for halloween. i'd love to have that now or one my size that i could wear whenever i go out and work in the garden. the thought CRACKS me up. but i am heavily medicated. funny thing about morphine... last time i had to take it for my back i had constant william burroughs black, shiny, exoskeleton insect dreams and visions. this time around, i close my eyes and i see dewey-eyed, furry animal face wallpaper. like little ferret faces repeated ad nauseum. or poodles. meercats! BUNNIES!!

      thanks for the thoughts you guys. i've been diagnosed with vertebral osteomyelitis -- or, a sick bone in my back. i'm in a brace (arg, some of the time), on IV antibiotics, got a TENS unit and plenty of narcotics for the pain. they hope that four to six weeks on antibiotics will make it go away. in the meantime i'm bedridden, which is just too freaking weird.   i wish i could blame my ill-health for my lack of posting, but that would be a lie. i've been so pissed off with politics that every time i sit down to write, the only stuff that comes out is frothy hatred for all things bush. i'm sincerely afraid the bushies are pathologically out of control. and there's so much stuff to say about it, it's exhausting. sure, there's the concrete worries about the economy and the war -- but i'm finding myself being even more outraged by the trivial shit -- like the commander in chimp taking a FUCKING MONTH VACATION while the country careens out of control. he's golfing while his troops are being picked off 3 and 4 at a time. do you know anyone who takes a month vacation every year? i've never heard of such a thing. wouldn't that be great though? a whole month off a year -- not including the generous time off for holidays. wow, that would make work seem almost humane. wouldn't it be nice if the Commander in Chimpster himself encouraged congress to mandate the same amount of holiday for us "regular joes?" hell, wouldn't it be nice if a reporter would simply ASK him to justify his month's vacation every year? man, when these narcotics kick in, they really send me off to la la land...

      well, its against the law in amerika for a farmer to tell his customers that he DOES NOT grow beans that have been genetically modified, because if consumers knew they had a choice, it might "harm" the farmers who grow gmo crops that won't otherwise sell.  its ag'in the law for dairies to promote the fact that they DO NOT use rBGH to make their cows "put out" more milk, because we might not buy milk if we knew its constituents. anyone milking naturally fed and humanely treated cows are shitouttaluck.  organicconsumers.org is  a good place to start (http://www.organicconsumers.org/ge/72803_ge_soybeans.cfm)  and we proceed with a society of children who get doses of hormones their bodies cannot metabolise. ritalination. nutrition: reaganketchup: anticipation is making me weight.  last week i watched "the manchurian candidate" , "dr. strangelove", "the price is right", and "harold and maude" my views do not reflect the views of this station or its sponsors or affiliates. i also listened to unrest, gbv, campervanbeethoven and thelonius monk. i readed "reefer madness" by eric schollser, "life is a miracle" by wendell berry, "New Stories from the South, 2003" and still had time to put a new heater core into my pickup.  al franken frankly ranks low in the hierarchy of bullshit. his rights are important and his case is important in the grand scheme. (ITS ABOUT TIMING, THOUGH...) Lets not allow Asscraft to tour(piss upon) our great land with his facist views while we all look toward Al Franken and the cover of his funnybook. this give and take to conquer is how we got the  gWHB whormone into the white house to begin with.  my fear is that this "fair and balanced" victory to the left is just hard candy to suck on while our real rights get sucked away.  but thats just me, and as bill has said recently, i can't hold back, and maybe someday I'LL tell you how i really feel...............actually i  use ALL ten fingers, if it is really dark.....................

      isn't the bush administration funny enough.  he's got lawyers and they will codify things for us one way or t' othern.  joke: my army captain neighbor spent 18 months on the border between south and north korea working for The Invisible Hand of Homeland Security. his time was finally up and he was ready to come home, get his daughter into school and try to figure out if his marriage was still drawing breathe.  instead The Invisible Hand of Homeland Security sent him to this town in iraq. his buddies killed saddam's sons and they were told, "great job, you guys are shipping out first week of august."   the other day (second week of august) he was told his good work had finally paid off and to pack up his shit, he was getting out of that hell hole. and The Invisible Hand of Homeland Security sent him to bagdad to pull a "security detail". I asked him who he had to piss off to get that job, but he didn't reply. They said if he did a good (ie, remain alive) he would be up for going home in april '04. just in time for easter!   punchline: fuck adam smith, i am sending my children to canada.

      I was in jc for 4 hours 9 days ago and the places i visited all would qualify for the lynchingparty: Pat's Mountaineer, where you ask for pbr and they ask you: shorts or talls; the one and only Horseshoe Lounge, which was kicking full on at 11:30 am, a muted Richard Petty press conference on one tv, a muted price is right on the other, country music and grease and cigarette smoke in the air, the only thing different is that some of the customers have cell phones; and Mosheim.   I also met a late-thirty-ish aged preacher who grew up in Knoxville who told me God had called him to JC to start up a new church. Imagine that, another church in jc! I had to ask if he was sure it was God who called in his transfer, and suggested maybe Satan was disguising his voice? but he didn't buy it.  The Mecca, the Mecca, I remember riding by the Mecca on my bike every morning at 7:45 or so and seeing all the Vets lined up at the bar having their 32 ounce Hamm's breakfast, and thinking, does Ronnie know you guys are in there? maybe he wouldn't be strolling thru nazi boneyards if he saw his fallen angels struggle so. And thinking casper weinberger,  thats a funny name... its sounds more like a drag queen stage name than a pentagon-type guy name.

      Without a doubt, my most Lynchian vision of JC and environs would be the flock of birds that flew into the ground. I see them laid out in V-formation on a sidewalk or a parking lot, little numbered tags attached to them and fluttering in the breeze, military brass standing around, lab-coated underlings roping off the area, taking photos and scribbling on clipboards...  Next to that, there was an occasion when many messed-up kids were sitting on a large porch in the wee, wee small hours of the morning and through the hedge came a skinny, twisted-looking guy on crutches. He was something of a low talker and he kept a distance between us, standing out in the yard, making us strain to hear him. He complained about his sad lot in life and asked if someone couldn't go inside and make him a sandwich. "Just a sandwich." A sandwich seemed to me at that time a lot to ask, involving bread, meat, mustard, mayo, lettice and tomato...Who did this guy think we were, the fucking Kings of Siam?  If we had ONE of those ingredients in the house, it was probably mayonnaise, and it was probably twenty years old. We told him so and he didn't believe us. He wanted to go in and see for himself. "I know I could find something to eat, just a sandwich..." He needed a reality check, bad. We told him it was up a lot of stairs, but then that seemed like more information than he really ought to have. The offensive capabilities of those metal, brace-like crutches were occuring to me about that time; they seemed not unlike double-length nightsticks with a hook on the end, and he had TWO of them. The more he kept talking about "JUST a sandwich," the more convinced I became that his economic standards for sustainance were ludicrously higher than mine, and it was starting to piss me off. He was letting us know in no uncertain terms how shitty he thought we were to not even offer him a sandwich, and it was clear that he was really taking advantage of the situation of being around people who, for reasons of their own, were reluctant to call the cops to make him leave. It went on and on in a slow-motion car-wreck kind of way and it became impossible to maintain a sense of how long he'd been there, harrassing us. Finally someone told him that if we had sandwich stuff in the house, we'd be eating sandwiches ourselves at that very moment. With this, he huffed off into the night on his largely unnecessary crutches, leaving us to ask, "Did all that just happen?"  My vote for the two most Lynchian places in town: The Mecca and the Downtown Restaurant...

      To my knowledge, no one has shat while talking on the phone to me. However, I could have missed some important clues. Knowing I could have unknowingly taken something of a number two position of importance in a conversation has given me something new to lay awake nights worrying about. "Talk Now--Shit Later" for a bumper sticker? (This is assuming everybody's seen the "Drive Now--Talk Later" ones.) Full-page ad in the New York Times with a laundry list of things you shouldn't do on the phone? Retro fitted cell phones with special shit-sound detectors and alarms? "Warning - this conversation will terminate in 3 seconds, unless you remove your ass from the porcelein." How about keeping a tape loop of massive diarrhea to fight back with? "That's see AND a raise, buddy!"

      Ah, the fair. The smells, the rides, the food and the...well, the smells. I haven't been to it in years. Too crowded. Too hot.  Most of my memories of the fair revolve around an old friend, Lisa Harkelroad. My freshman year in high school, Lisa and another girl decided to run away and leave with the fair. Their parents were frantic and everyone who was known to be close to the girls was called to the office and interrogated. Meanwhile, Lisa's mother figured out where they were and they had to travel out of state to pick the girls up where they found them staying with carnie guys in thier 30's or something, smoking copious amounts of dope and listening to way too much Molly Hatchet. Years later I would see Lisa at the fair again, working the ticket booths. She was a junkie by this time, all sunken eyes and needle tracks. She was in pain almost all the time, but she would always talk a good game about how delightful her life was and whose ass she had kicked recently. Because of her, I stopped getting on the rides, since she explained to me exactly how shit-faced the guys were who put them together. I always imagined my ferris wheel car crashing to the ground because of one loose screw, no pun intended. Lisa actually became a full-time carnival worker, traveling the country and getting more addicted. She overdosed almost three years ago, and at her funeral, people who like to think they have class spoke in hushed whispers about what a terrible junkie she was. How you couldn't really be surprised that she was dead because of how she had lived. How the only thing they were surprised by is that it had taken her so long to finally get to that point. And of course, all of the horrible things she had done to support her habit. All of this within earshot of her then 14 yr. old daughter. That daughter, now 16, has been staying with my family for a bit this summer, which is why all of this is so much on my mind. She's a wonderful, well-adjusted girl who misses her Mom terribly and still thinks of her as being a parent who tried her very best. I love to get her tickled because when she laughs, she sounds just like Lisa. And if Lisa were standing over my shoulder reading this she'd start bitching. "This shit is sad as fuck, Nicky!" She would not be impressed. I won't be taking her daughter to the fair, by the way.  Oh, and to change the subject, I really hate to be talking to someone on the phone and have them start grunting because they're taking a shit. Is nothing sacred? I don't know about any anti-shitting on the phone bumper stickers, but you'd think some sort of group could be started of people who oppose this.  Just say 'No' to shitting while conversing. You would think that you wouldn't have to remind folks of that.

      aaron copeland never made it to gray station in the late summer. what a shame.  my favorite appy fair memory involves Ray Charles, too! the sound check, not the performance, though. it was the afternoon, around 6 or so and all the families were just starting to arrive. funnel cake and what not wafting through the air. the rides and games were just coming on line. All around, the jesus-loves-you-tee-shirt-wearing-white-obese-christian demographic coming full force to the cotton candy stand like it was the wailing wall.   And in the distance, Ray and his band break into "georgia" and half way thru the first stanza, he stops playing the piano, the band peters out and through the p.a. you hear something like: "if you hillbilly cracker mutha fuckas could take your heads out of your asses long enough, i might be able to hear something that sounds like something that ain't mutha fucking bullshit!" after a pause, the one-two-three into the song, and then another long "mutha fucking this mutha fucking that..."   by 8 o'clock they had everything worked out, soundwise. still, to this day, trying to figure out what to do with all the hillbilly crackers.   as for lynchian aspects... i have tried hard myself to align events with that dreamlike economy of vision. but upper east tennessee (upper is quite right) seems more in line with TROMA-VISION than twin peaks.   however, when i think of all the little nobodys who showed up from the surrounding area, suffered head trauma and engaged in hot lusty same sex affairs with latinos and/or australians, i am saddened to think there is no address that can be numbered   mullholland drive, johnson city, tn 37601     furthermore, once upon a time, my cousin from california came to visit for the summer and he was enamoured with a little wooden pipe he had made in woodshop class at his school the semester before. he felt like a genius for getting through the airlines with it in tow. it looked like a little box that you could store loose change or matches in, with a sliding lid, but it had a secret compartment type deal, that actually earned him an "A" from his surfer-type vo-tech teacher. of course, we ramsacked my dads shop looking for a metal storm door screen remnant to cut into a little circle, but, details, details. I was more impressed with the fact that he could get SO MUCH hash thru tri-cities airport (2-months worth for at least four people). ah, he scoffed, glad sandwich baggy's and peanut butter in the suitcase, no big thing...and he had an eight track from a band called a flock of seagulls. oh the hair. and my sharona. did i mention all the hash? i had never heard of afganistan before... or i ran for that matter... but, as far as how this relates to our collective, we went to jonesboro days later that summer, and toured the sheriff england drugbustshopofhorrors and my cousin picked up this nice molded human skull with holes in the right places and turned, unwittingly to a plainclothes deputy and asked "how much do you want for this?"  "that's contraband, boy." he said with his razor sharp good seeing eye,  "what's your name?" he asked. i think my cousin said he was Han Solo, but i am no longer sure. "You better watch youself..." the lawman said, " HAN!, what kinda name is that?" "french." my cousin replied back-peddling as we disapearred behind the sweet iced tea cart.  presently my cousin is a billionaire republican with homes on three continents who has never heard of "hash" and i am a poor chicken farmer clutching the fringe of the north american postal code...who thinks "hash" is something they "sling" at truck stops involving overcooked vegetables,  note: in your original post, Doug, you wrote:  "When I was little..."  I have trouble thinking of you as ever being "...little..." can you document this?

      Hey Doug! It's really good to see your Times Romans on the screen. Last I heard you were teaching at Northeastern in Boston?, and I know you're married and now have a baby? I saw you at Todd's wedding, but we didn't get to talk. It's good to know you're around the blog. Yes, the Appalachian Fair is on its way. My memories are similar to yours, I guess - the ducks; the strange Lynchian connection; the music that I remember was once really great. I also saw Merle Haggard there, with my parents. I remember my Dad saying to me, "Don't ever forget this." My dad used to win some tacky stuffed animal for me at those booths. I remember in particular a pink and white bear, huge, full of those beans that, in a few days, were flying around my bedroom after I'd already punched a hole in the thing. I remember a lot of guys spitting and me trying to imitate them, including my dad, who, when he was trying to quit smoking, would chew Red Man.   On the other end of the spectrum, this weekend here, in J.C., the 7th annual Umoja Festival is being held Fri. through Sun.. It usually goes on in Carver Park. Umoja is Swahili for Unity. It's basically an African/African-American celebration. Do you believe it? This year, it was held at Freedom Hall, and I've enjoyed it - a lot of booths with crafts from West Africa, and even Caribbean and African cuisine. Pretty amazing for around here. One booth, Joan's Caribbean Cuisine, served some great jerk chicken and other stuff. Art dealers up from Atlanta and other places. African music. I've been really impressed, and it's the first year I've heard about it. It receives little advertising though, mainly in a small paper here called News and Neighbor. Did anyone else in J.C. see or hear any other advertisements?   Lisa, I don't know why forgetting about a murder would make you feel you're going insane. But if it helps, I remember that murder. I didn't know the people, though. I heard about it through Randy Hixson, soon after it first happened. I remember he went to the funerals. (s). There was all this upset, naturally. It's funny, how you hear a story, about something that actually happened to people you don't know but, in a way, do know indirectly, and how you replay it in your mind. Also everyone who tells it, tells it differently, since they weren't there, of course. I always picture a squarish blue car, and then a series of events, certain clothing, hair a certain length, a smell in the air...I imagine standing there while it happened, or watching from above, like I'm flying. And then, I do know Jerry Henninger, who has performed in several J.C. bands, was dating the woman at the time she was killed.  Later, when I was working at Buffalo Mtn. Camp, in the retreat center (late 90's), we had this group of Jesuit priests come in from all over the country for a conference. One of the priests, a guy from Detroit, wanted me to take him somewhere "scenic". I decided on Beauty Spot, even though I hadn't been up there since the murder. On the way there, I told him what happened. What I'd heard. He was wearing his priest's robe too. Brown, with a hood; I shit you not. He was from Detroit, and my story "triggered" (pardon the pun) a memory of his own, when a man threatened to kill him in the inner city. I remember he said something priestly and profound, while this person held a gun to his head. He said something like, "If you feel this is something you must do, for your own well-being or someone else's, then I am ready to help." The guy dropped his gun in the road and ran off, he said. We got to Beauty Spot. It was foggy and drizzling rain, and he prayed the entire time we stood up there. I haven't been up there since.   On An Entirely Different Note:: I just need to discuss this. It's funny, not long ago, my brother called me. While we were talking on the phone, his voice echoed; you know, like he was in the bathroom or somethin'. I ignored it, and we talked, and then, while he was trying to tell me something, his voice was straining. I'm like, "What's wrong? What're you doing?" He says, "I'm taking a shit."  TAKING A SHIT??!!!  Needless to say, I hung up on him. This is a problem that needs to be addressed, and it has happened to me more than once, not only with family, but friends too. Why do people feel it's ok to talk on the phone while they piss or shit now? Is it just because we are now free to do so?--unencumbered as we are now of the twisty chord? Somehow, the removal of the telephone chord has created this situation that, call me old-fashioned, I find disturbing. It's like, people now think, "Man, I'm so relieved; I no longer have to piss alone?" One of the things that's always comforted me is that I DO piss alone, and shit alone, and I will continue to do so and hope others will do the same. We need to nip this in the bud. What's next? You're eating dinner with soemone, and they just drop trow and piss right there in the floor so as not to interrupt the "natural flow" of conversation? Or, suddenly, being alone in a bathroom stall is disturbing, creating some kind of unwanted separation anxiety that---now--is unnecessary because, hey, I can always call someone while I'm pissin'? I'm ready for a bumper sticker. So--while everyone is thinking of Lynchian J.C. moments per Doug's request, maybe they can come up with a good bumper sticker for this problem?   Hopefully---Julie

      Hello bloggers, I see in the JC Press that it's almost time for the Appalachian Fair again.  I have always loved the Fair, if only for one thing: the spectacle of dozens of ducklings marching up a ramp, trying to get some food, and falling back down a slide into a pond.  When I was little it was funny, and when I got older it became allegorical, and when I got a little older than that it was just funny again (OK, and a little bit allegorical).  I also especially enjoyed Ron England's Jail, where the glass display cases of homemade weaponry and dope paraphernalia seemed to be having the opposite of its intended effect, as kids and battled-scarred good ol' boys circled around going "Cool!"  and "Man, I need me one of those!" as they looked at the spiked brass knuckles and hash pipes.  The other thing that makes me fondly recall those golden Fairs of yesteryear was that it used to be a pretty awesome place to see live music, back when the roster consisted almost entirely of just-over-the-hill, underappreciated country stars.  I saw Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard there.  I saw Charlie Daniels turn in a tremendous performance.  He sang his new, awful, socially-conservative version of "Long Haired Country Boy" but you couldn't make out what the cleaned-up words were because the crowd screamed the old lyrics over the bowdlerized sections.  I saw Ray Charles there a couple of years before Diet Pepsi repackaged him.  Seems like just about everybody I saw there has since either died, retired, or been re-discovered by Rick Rubin or somebody and is now playing the Knitting Factory.  The best thing about seeing music at the Fair, though, was being in this crowd of folks where most were just rank-and-file Tri-Citians who were there because it was free and they were killing time waiting for the pig races, but some of them had come down from Tolleytown or St. Charles or someplace for the great social outing of the year, and then there was a sprinkling of the local musicians, artists, and other assorted oddballs whose copy of Golden Hits of Ray Charles was sitting next to Bad Music for Bad People and Who's Next in the record rack because that's the kind of weird shit that happens when you grow up middle-class, smart, and bored in East Tennessee.  Here's a related question for discussion: what scenes from David Lynch movies most remind you of Johnson City?  (I'm operating under the assumption that everyone from Johnson City who sees a David Lynch film--even Dune--is at some point reminded of home.)

      I tried to email this to you, Tony, but it bounced back so I'll post it here.   You are just too super-groovy cool...Did you find this in JC Press on-line archives? I didn't think they went back far enough, but I did try "Beauty Spot," "Erwin," "Unicoi," and "murders" and "shooting" (which was all I could remember) in all possible combinations, so I'm curious as to how you found this.  I greatly appreciate your contribution towards restoring my sanity. Next time I see a fur-lined waffle iron, I'll get it for you.

      "Two-time killer seeks Relief", published 8/14/02, though not a steve earle song, was printed in the Johnson City Press, formerly known as the Johnson City Press-Chronicle, motto: "What You Don't Know, WILL HURT YOU!"  whatever happened to that big modern art metal egg beater that used to hang off the building? is it still there?  why did they take the image off the masthead?  better yet, why did they write the "..seeks relief" article and never follow up on the Jones post-conviction writ in the paper? for all we know Jones is out of prison. he is now old enough to buy alcohol. and vote- if he ever got so inclined. or he could be on death row. or playing old maid with the guys who killed wade janney. or maybe working for the newspaper(they were owned by jones' i think.)

      not sure about birds running into the ground, but heard the flying burrito brothers hit a wall in the early 70's. in blogger tradition of copy and paste found info, liz, some of your mentis is still compos, see below.  Two-time killer seeks relief  By Chris Garland Erwin Bureau  ERWIN — Martin P. Jones, who pleaded guilty as a 15-year-old to killing a man and woman on a Unaka Mountain overlook in 1997 filed a post-conviction writ in Unicoi County Criminal Court this week.  According to Assistant District Attorney Tony Clark, Jones was sentenced in October 1997 for the shooting deaths of John H. Harder and Marsina Ratliff, both residents of Johnson City. Jones, also of Johnson City, was to be tried as an adult. Before the trial took place, he surprised the court and pleaded guilty, receiving two consecutive life sentences after a daylong hearing in Unicoi County.  Represented by the Public Defenders Office in 1997, Jones made a detailed confession the morning after the murders and surprised the court in August by entering a “best interest plea,” rather than taking his chances with a jury, but he claimed he did not actually commit the murders.  The minimum portion of a life sentence that can be served in Tennessee before an offender is eligible for parole is 51 years, meaning Jones will not be eligible for parole until 2099.  Clark said Jones is now represented by Attorney Bob Green and the post-conviction writ will be recalled on Nov. 20. “Right now, Jones will have 30 days to file a legal document that may allege he was not represented effectively by the Public Defenders Office when he made his plea. Then our office will have 30 days to file an answer,” Clark said.  A Criminal Court judge will then look at the filings and, upon his findings, may at that time set a hearing date based on the information provided. “This is just the beginning of the process,” Clark said Tuesday. If Jones is successful, he may be entitled to a new hearing or trial for the murders.  According to reports in 1997, Jones confessed to traveling to Beauty Spot in a car he had stolen in Carter County. He walked toward the victims’ car and shot Harder to death outside the car after Harder asked him whether he had jumper cables. Jones told investigators he then shot Miss Ratliff as she attempted to run away.  Both Harder and Ratliff died from multiple gunshot wounds from a .22-caliber rifle, which was found near the scene of the murders. Jones also admitted to stealing that weapon and some others from a Carter County home.  Investigators taking Jones’ confession assumed he used a .22-caliber handgun that found in his possession, as was Harder’s driver’s license. Jones insisted he had used a rifle during the killings, and ballistics tests confirmed a rifle was the murder weapon.  Jones told investigators he killed the two for money and that he retrieved $11 dollars from their pockets after they were dead.  Judge Lynn Brown took the plea and stated, “We have a rather young man in this case who placed a greater value on the money that was in the pockets of these two people than he did on their lives.”  Brown also said he could not remember any murderers in his courtroom who exhibited less remorse for their crimes than Jones showed during the numerous court appearances since his arrest.

      OK Elizabeth Brook,,, yes a couple got shot at Beauty Spot,,, I think it was early to mid 90's. As to the birds flying into the ground in formation, I think you are crazy, I don't remember hearing that one. It seems that the shooting was band related, but I don't recall more than that. I would note that the last place Wade Jenning was seen was at a Hindu Rib Roast; thats not really relevant, but I think it should be mentioned from time to time...

      Help me, bloggers of the Johnson City variety, confirm that my memory is not wholly shot to shit...two incidents in the mid-90's. One, a couple got shot at Beauty Spot. The girl's name was Marcia and she sang in a local band called "Crystal Visions." Two, a flock of birds flew into the ground in or near Erwin. They were still in V-formation on the ground and the story was picked up by the AP and some military specialist was sent to examine them to try to figure out why fighter pilots get disoriented and lead formations into the ground or the side of a mountain sometimes. Somebody tell me they remember either of these two things or I will go really crazy.

      RESUME George W. Bush The White House, Washington, DC, USA   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE I ran for Congress and lost.  I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil in Texas; the company went bankrupt shortly after I sold all my stock.  I bought the Texas Rangers baseball team, in a sweetheart deal and built a stadium using taxpayer money.  With my father's help and name, I was elected Governor of Texas.   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR I changed pollution laws in favor of the power and oil companies and made TX the most polluted state in the US. And replaced Houston over LA as the most smog-ridden city in America.  Cut taxes and bankrupted TX government to the tune of billions of dollars in borrowed money.  I set the record for most executions by a Governor in US history.  I became US President after losing the popular vote by over 500,000 votes with the help of major Enron money and my father's appointments to the Supreme Court.   PRESIDENTIAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS I attacked and overtook two countries.  I spent the US surplus and bankrupted the US Treasury.  I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in US history.  I set an economic record for private bankruptcies in any 12-month period.  I set the all time record for the biggest drop in history of the US stock market.  I am the first president in US history to enter office with a criminal record.  I set the record for most days on vacation in any one year.  After taking the entire month of August off, I presided over the worst security failure in US history.  I set the record for most campaign fundraising trips by a US president.  I set the records for the least amount of press conferences than any president since the advent of television.  I presided over the biggest energy crisis in US history and refused to intervene when oil industry corruption was revealed.  I have cut health care benefits for war veterans.  I set the all time record for the largest number of people worldwide to protest my policies in public venues (15 million) shattering the record for protest against anyone in world history.  I have dissolved more international treaties than any president in US history.  I have made my presidency the most secretive and unaccountable of any in US history.  I am the first president of US to have all 50 states simultaneously go bankrupt.  I presided over the biggest corporate stock market fraud in any country in history.  I am the first president to order a preemptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation, and did so against the will of the United Nations.  I set the all-time record for biggest annual budget spending increases, more than any president in US history.  I am the first president to have the UN remove the US from the Human Rights Commission.  I withdrew the US from the World Court.  I refused to allow inspectors access to prisoners of war and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.  I am the all-time US and world record holder for receiving the largest corporate campaign donations.  My largest campaign contributor and one of my best friends, Ken Lay, former CEO of Enron, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in US history.  My political party used the Enron Private jets and their corporate attorneys to assure my success with the Supreme Court during the 2000 election.  I am the first president in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security.  In the past 22 months since the World Trade Center attack, I have successfully prevented any public investigation into the biggest security failure in US history.  In a little over two years, I have created the most divided country in decades, possibly the most divided since the Civil War.  I entered office with the strongest economy in US history and have turned every single economic category downward, all in less than two years.

      Another JC story, thanks for that. I admit I barely remember seeing Cricket Machine, but then again, I barely remember a lot of things back then. I think I only managed to see you guys once or twice anyway. I do remember just about everyone complaining about Cricket Machine riffing on REM too much, but it sounds like you’re refuting that, pretty much.   Hey, where the hell is Damon? He’s the only one outta that crew I knew. Damon was a cool guy I thought. As far as I recall, he was a very laid back individual always ready for a party. I remember numerous occasions that he would scrounge the bars for cigarette butts to toke on. Can’t think of many other people that did that…

      I have spent some time reading through some of the posts about old J.C. bands, and I wanted to share with everyone the first time Cricket Machine played in J.C. at the Highlander, and how this event led to a year long exile in Kingsport, or Chemsport, for some of you other Kingsport natives.  Well, I believe it was around 1989, I'm a little fuzzy on the fine details. We were hanging out at the Highlander, actually now it becomes clear, it was the same night as a pretty massive earthquake rocked San Francisco, and oddly enough, I was working hard to beat the high score on the Galaga Machine at the Highlander, nervous about getting on a real stage for the time.  Anyways, we were set to play their open mic night or whatever, we must have gotten there at like 8:00 or so, not a sole was there except for some crusty behind the bar(I think it was Danny) and Doug. We were young, Joey and I were 17, Damon, was 18 had just started school at ETSU, and Chris Gose the drummer was 18 and was down as Tusculum College. I had never been in a "club" before, and neither had Joey, and we had never played out, except for maybe a couple of parties, but we were definitely ready to make some noise. I think we were the only band scheduled for the night, and by the time is came time to play, like 10:30p.m., (11:30p.m. being Joey's curfew) there were a few folks there. We did our extended set of about 1 and 1/2  hours of music, and I must say for some green horns, we rocked out with our cocks out! And yes, specifically for Gary and Drew :), our set did contain our two REM songs, that would forever lets us be known as the band that sounds like REM. Nevertheless, we rocked and Doug invited us back for the very next night, to do our own gig, and man we were going crazy. We didn't have enough songs to really do a whole night, but we accepted the offer without a second thought. We left our gear there, in anticipation that we would return for the next night.    When we returned home around 1:30a.m., our singer, Joey, found himself in a world of hurt. His parents were absolutely livid, and immediately grounded him for a month, and would not allow him to play out the next night. Man, were we screwed! Here, we had worked hard for like three solid months in anticipation to play out at a real club, we kicked some ass, got our own gig, and now our singer was grounded, and hell, he was the only one who could sing, and knew the words to all the songs. Neither Damon, Chris, or I could pull this off without him, so we decided we had to cancel the next night's gig. The shitty part about it was that we had to drive to J.C. to pick up our gear at the Highlander, and tell Doug, in person, we had to cancel. Can you imagine having to tell a club owner, we can't play tonight cause our singer got grounded! Man, was Doug pissed off, I think he started throwing our gear out the door, and his last comment to us, as we got in our car was, "As far as I'm concerned your name is Mud around Johnson City", or something to that effect! This was embarrassing with all the locals outside there lookin' at us, laughing, etc. This would begin a year long exile in Kingsport, playing parties and Woodstone Deli, still desiring that one night on stage at a real club in J.C.   It finally came about a year later, after I had started school at ETSU, and we played an open mic night at The Pub Outback, where Doug was running sound. We billed ourselves under the name Mud, and Doug about shit when we walked in with our gear. Needless to say, he introduced us as Cricket Machine, and that would be our "re-start" to music fun in Johnson City.   Thanks for the opportunity to share this story.

      It occurs to me that most of us did not know Ritter, Cash or Zevon, but at one time or another we all met Denise Cozad; for those who have not heard she passed away last week, after a long, brave and graceful fight against cancer. Please keep her, her family and of course all her friends in your thoughts and prayers.

      as many of you guys know, i've been in the hospital on and off all summer long. tonite is the first titans game (which to me is the official start of autumn) and i'm going to watch it from the ancient 15" Magnavox hanging from the wall in this hellhole, i mean prison, i mean place of healing.   Maybe it's the drugs -- I'm on a constant drip of Dilaudid, plus i can pump my own every few minutes. Nurses wake me up every day at 6am, "your Valium Ms. Hines," and continue this ritual every 6 hours all day -- but why is it, when you are all alone with no sensory input except the ticking of the clock and dripping of the IV, that your mind fills with the most foul of pop songs. I've had Rod Stewart's Heart and Soul STUCK in my head for a week solid. Mentally, I have to sing every word. Here's another I can't get rid of, Bob Seagar, Rock and Roll Never Forgets. Whatthefuckingfuck? I HATE Bob Seagar. But every half hour, here's my brain... "you can come back baby..." What a lame song, anyway. It's like his producer said, "write a commercial for 'rocknroll,' man.' God, yuck! No sooner have i recovered from the late 70s aural hallucinations, than i hear The Waitressess singing "I know what boys like, I know what guys want..." I always hated that song too. Such a Walmart interpretation of punk rock. And the chick who sang it was really quite unattractive and annoying in the video -- which would be fine with just a little more irony thrown in. But alas... we're to believe that men are such simple creatures that not only can the downmarket singer, but all women, everywhere can have any man wrapped about her press-on nailed little finger with the right combination of cliched flirting techniques (lick lips, suck hard candy, toss and run bony fingers thru bad 80s hair -- and he's all yours!  Any fish that can be caught with that bait needs to be checked for illness. But that's beside the point.... I'M THE SICK ONE HERE. I should be having all the yummy, happy hallucinations these pharmaceutical drugs can provide, and they should be good.  Whatever happened to my wallpaper bunnies?

      Ha! scott -- I remember that night. Lisa kept saying she "brained" herself. poor thing. had a taco-shaped bruise on her forehead for weeks. Drew was there too because i remember Lori Moore (is that her name?) -- went to vet school in mississippi -- kept calling him Duke because he was wearing a Duke University t-shirt that said DUKE real big across. Lori is completely entertained by repeatedly calling him duke instead of drew. Lynn Youngquist was there b/c she kept saying, "HA ha, Drew is Duke -- we are going to start calling you duke, the duke of drew...." on and on.  we left because a car drove up and said we were Tresapassin'. Can't recall if they were cops or just guards from the animal clinic. We apologized profusely in our very best imitations of fine upstanding PBR-drinking citizens. But i remember (half jokingly) asking if this were a common problem, and they said that yes, as a matter of fact, people bring boom boxes down there and everything!   As far as the being a bunch of LOSERS, for hanging out and drinking under a bridge next to the rail road -- all I can say is, "come on." It's big, honking American Gothicanna. Pabst Blue Ribbon! Underage drinking! Hitting your head HARD on the industrial revolution. We were doing research. However, if we were STILL drinking PBR, under that bridge, I would totally agree. Loserville.

               While authorities in South America and Mexico struggle to cope with attacks by the goat-killing demon, El Chupacabra, in Wisconsin a bizarre new menace has struck fear into the hearts of civilians and the military alike.  It is the monster now known as -- "El Cowpacabra."  Part demon, part purebred Guernsey, El Cowpacabra has appeared in areas where there has been a high incidence of recent UFO sightings. El Cowpacabra has been blamed for the destruction of thousands of mechanical milking machines across the state.  In these regions, a number of poodles have also been reported dead or missing.  And now comes word of even worse terror, reports that witnesses have seen the Cowpacabra force-feeding artificial growth hormones to dairy corporation officials until they blow up like balloons and explode.  Said one trembling veterinarian: "I've heard of 'mad cows.' But I've never seen one this p.o.'d."  Other experts interviewed said they feared Cowpacabra depredations would have an impact on margarine supplies throughout the state.  Eyewitness descriptions of the Cowpacabra vary. One Cudahy Dairy Queen employee who came upon the beast rampaging though a storeroom filled with canisters of Tastee Freez, said: "I've never seen anything like it. It was like 7 feet tall and weighed 300 pounds. It had fangs like a rattler, wings like a bat, the head of a polled heifer and a beer belly. And it had a horrible smell. Like, like," -- here she broke down -- "like Bradford Beach in August."  A cranberry bog worker, who observed "The Bovine Beast" stalking deer hunters near East Krock, claimed it also had a milk mustache.  Other Cowpacabra sightings have been linked to the discovery across the state of mysterious "crop circles," or, as paranormal experts have come to call them in this case: "crop pies."   Regional folklore holds that Cowpacabra leavings are particularly acidic, and some road repaving companies are blaming the number of highway potholes not on their use of cheap asphalt, but on the demon's cud-spitting habits.  And reports that Cowpacabra methane-like "emissions" have a chemical makeup akin to that of Easy Off Oven Cleaner have caused dozens of worried Illinois tourists to cancel vacation plans at destinations north of Nutterville.   No authenticated photo of the "Devil Cow" exists. However, a Beaver Dam resident videoing his grandson's sack race at Beaver Fest '96 allegedly caught the Cowpacabra on tape, and a photo from that tape has been distributed on the World Wide Web.  Government officials were quick to deny there was any truth to the reports, chalking them up to "mass hysteria." One Air Force colonel identified the photo as that of a "weather balloon," but could not explain what such a balloon was doing hovering at the same level as the fest's bratwurst stand.  And so-called "cow-spiracy theorists" charged that the Air Force actually had a carcass of the beast in cold storage at a secret military installation near Rib Lake known only as "Rest Area 51."  Speculation on the possible origins of El Cowpacabra has grown. "Everyone knows it's a mutant caused by the Navy's Extremely Low Frequency radio transmitter," said Cowpacabra expert Chris Carter. Others blame runoffs from mining operations or the Deep Tunnel Project.  Some believers have claimed supernatural powers for the creature. Indeed, one hidden witness observed members of the dairy supremacist cult "Cowpacabra Nation" on a hilltop attempting to summon the beast with a mantra that he said "sounded like 'ooom, only backward."  With so little actually known about the exact nature of El Cowpacabra, local police have despaired of capturing it.

      Thanks for the text preference advice, Brook; it did the trick!        Isn't it odd how every time somebody from Tex-ass gets into the White House, the first thing that they do is pick a fight?        And isn't it strange that those same he-boys manage to enhance their own less than heroic service records, or just dodge the draft entirely?        Every time I think of that Ann Coulter nut-case referring to Duh-Bya as a "Warrior King" I just chuckle.          All that being said, can we try mostly stick to Johnson City Stories on this thing? I'd much rather tell about James Arwood waking up nekkid on the Youngquist's porch than to get bent outta shape about politics.          Incidently, (in reply to a prior query) for the record, both Kurt Hagardorn and Martin Patrick have a non-standard number of toes.  Rick, is that one of Laura and Peee-terrrr's kids?

      Top o the news yesterday was that Bush was heckled and protested in Australia -- as if the Aussies have a special distaste for Bush not shared by the rest of the world.   Three words --  FREE SPEECH ZONES  You heard of these? They are special cordoned-off areas usually miles away from a "presidential" (sic) event. Apparently, Bush doesn't have the strength of character needed to face his detractors in his own country. Like some spoiled oil prince he has ordered the dissenters to be removed. Any fourth-grader can tell you that on the face of it -- this is UNamerican. We have a right to free assembly and free speech. People who are willing to go out and make statements like that are like white blood cells in a sick country. We need them. And we need to SEE and HEAR the dissent taking place on our soil.   BUT, you won't ever see any of that FREE SPEECH here in the US (unless we are willing to get arrested). You have to go to the OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANET to get that. To me, that is as fucked up as water running counter-clockwise down the drain.

      Probably not the best case to discuss dignity and dying, it just does not fit too neatly in that package; I suspect that Bush acted due to pressure from within his own party's right wing not so much from his own desires. He could have just issued and executive order to replace the feeding tube and it would have been just as constitutional as an ex post facto law passed by the legeslature,,, Instead he passed the buck (wisely I think) to the fairly left leaning legeslature on the assumption that they would not do anything about it. Opps, they called his bluff and dumped this mess back on him. So while I think a robust disscussion is needed on the right to die, this case has too many side issues to ever get it pidgeon holed into a black and white question. I suspect that  every politician in Flordia would have loved to had this one come down anywhere else....

      Geez Brook....  I don't think Jeb ordered Terri be kept alive at any cost.  As far as I can tell, all he wanted was the feeding tube be put back in.  I don't have a problem with the right to die with dignity, but dehydration and starvation ain't how anyone ought to die.

      apropos to nothing... i've been thinking about this all day and i'm so confused...  Jeb Bush, acting as governor-slash-pro-life czar of the state of Florida, has ordered that a brain dead woman be kept alive against her wishes and the wishes of her husband. Neither she nor her immediate family can determine if she lives or dies -- the governor literally has the last say. This has to be a marketing campaign. A publicity stunt aimed at Florida's senior population.   "Live forever in Florida!"  "Come to Florida, where no one ever dies! Not even little kitties."  "Florida -- if you ain't living, you're under arrest."  I'm all for eternal life, but I thought the whole point of being a god-fearing Christian was to be able to face death with some dignity, secure in the knowledge Pete would find your name on the guest list.   So why should Jeb care? Oh sure, it's sad that there's a brain dead woman -- pump some saline solution into her and see if that helps. What the fuck. She is brain dead and the game plan is to give her some food by IV. That's not a plan. That's like when your car breaks down and you open the hood. You don't know shit about cars, but you open the hood. It's the least you can do and it prolongs the inevitable of actually walking somewhere to get help. If they want her re-animated so bad, why didn't Jeb order The Paddles... uh CLEAR! And if that doesn't work they should try that stuff that Vince Vega gave Mia Wallace when she shorted all that heroin. That worked.  If hospital food by IV were going to wake her up, it would have happened already.

      Standin' in a field Chewin' on a cud Eatin' lotsa grass Life sure is a dud  Hindus in the street Look at all the meat It can't be had Might be Granddad  Leather for our wallets Hamburgers to eat Tails make good whips To beat you in the street  Can't ya understand  What cows really mean Why if it weren't fer cattle No more Dairy Queens  You can never tell When a cow passes 'Cause they're masters of disguise Behind those dark sunglasses  We just don't realize We just don't see If not for bovine intervention McDonald's wouldn't be  I think I'm goin' crazy Cows are everywhere Hidin' in the freezer And underneath the stairs  When we want milk We just squeeze their tits We chop 'em up for steaks Now ain't that the pits?  So when yer down and out Feelin' lonely and afraid just think about those friendly Cows On Parade  I'm sure there are more lyrics, but these are all I can remember at the moment As I recall Bill,Rick,Bill's bro John, and myself wrote most of the lyrics in my folks basement around '80-'81; and Jeff and I added some stuff later.  Dunno if Ben wrote any lyrics or not, but he did come up with the guitar line.  And BBBruce threw in the "bovine intervention" line.

      yep his dad's name is Raymond, and his mom is Peggy, with Matthew the little brother and Diana the little sis (and Rhonda the Welsh Corgi); they might all be staying with Jeff's grandmother (dunno her name)  and Randall and Matt were both working for Piney Flat Bicycles some years back, but I haven't seen them in a while

      Hey I know this one,,, Randall is living in the Tri-Cities, should be in the phone book, he works as a medical sales rep., selling I believe prosthetic devices,,,, I may be wrong on that.

      Well, it's narrowed down to Chattanooga...thanks Roland.  I'll throw out a couple of other names from the old days. Whatever happened to Matt and Randall Jones? And what about Pauli Allison? I haven't talked to Pauli since she was at Anderson College, but I know that she had married a man named David, moved to the Carolinas, and had a baby. That was the late 80's and I've heard nothing since.

      hey Bill and Nicky  to answer all the questions/ confirm all the answers; Jeff Campbell is working as a long-haul trucker making most runs all the way to California.  He lives in Chattanooga with his folks (this is from Alan Prince). Ruthanne and Sheree are still living in the area, while Anne is living in Portland.  When my class had it's 20th reunion (I didn't go, of course) she and Alan stopped by and we hung out and had a great time.  Anne still looks pretty much like she did 20 years ago (Prince and I do not, however)

      I ran into Sheri (pronounced Leonard Skinerd,,, oops, I mean Share-ree) about 2 years ago in J.C., she was married and working at Shoneys at the time, but I have not seen her since, I imagine she is still around North JC. Their other friend Ruth still lives on the family farm with her hubby and a couple of kids, she is teaching in Sullivan Co. and would probably know the whereabouts of both Sheri and Anne....

      The last I heard of Jeff, he was a long haul trucker. Really,,, no shit! Jeff has always been one of my favorite people and  a forgotten hero in the early JC scene. Little known fact; he was one of 4 bass players that Final Curtain had in its history, but it should be noted that when Bruce first suggested starting a band, it was Jeff that volunteered before anyone else that night at QB's. Mind you starting a punk band in JC during 1984 was a risky enough proposition, and at one of our shows we had a black guy demand that we play Lynrd Skynrd,,,, strange and violent night, but I digress,,,, anyway, I heard that Jeff was a trucker from a client as he was being sent to jail for raping his best friend's wife, so that info might be suspect.   One other Final Curtain Fun Fact,,, at one time, the majority of our members had dated Anne Canter... including Jeff!  Jeff left the area in 1985 or so and moved with his family to California, but in the late 80's and early 90's I spoke to him via phone and he was in Chattanoga. After that, I lost touch with him... super super super nice guy, and probably the greatest intellect ever to drive an 18 wheeler!  So if you are out there Jeff and reading this, write me at bill37663@hotmail..... and Nicky if you want to know about who has six toes, you better write me there too. It's kind of a long story..........  Also Jeff, if you are reading this, how egotistical does a person have to be to do a name search on themselves???

      Oh, please tell me about the many-toed band! Now there's a request you don't hear everyday...and I'll bet I'm the only person on the blog who doesn't know who you are talking about...  I went to the same high school as you, Bill. I was a freshman when you were a senior. You would probably not remember, as I didn't really stand out all that much. I do remember discussing music with you a time or two. Ah, a fond memory... And on another note, does anybody know whatever became of Mr. Jeff Campbell?

      Or perhaps Roland, we could use the blog to publish the Final Curtain Fun Facts List; Remember? About how we all had an uncle named Steve, and how unlike another JC band none of us had more than 5 toes on either foot?

By the way, are "Surf Nazis Must Die", "Sorority Babes in Slimeball Bowlarama" or "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers" out on DVD yet?

      Ah, Bill has broken the silence... Here's a lovely e-mail joke that I recently received:   Three dogs, a Doberman, a Boxer, and a Labrador are sitting in the waiting room at the vet's office when they strike up a conversation.   The Doberman turns to the Boxer and says, "So why are you here?"   The Boxer replies, "I'm a pisser." "I piss on everything - the sofa, the cat, the kids." "But the final straw was last night, when I pissed in the middle of my owner's bed."   The Doberman says, "So what is the vet going to do?"   "Lethal injection" came the reply from the sad Boxer.   The Doberman then turns to the Labrador and asks, "Why are you here?"   The Lab says, "I'm a digger." "I dig under fences, dig up flowers and trees." "I dig just for the hell of it." "When I'm inside, I dig up the carpets." "But I went over the line last night when I dug a great big hole in my owner's couch."   "So what are they going to do to you?" the Doberman inquired.   "Lethal injection" came the reply from the sad Labrador.   The Labrador then turns to the Doberman and asks why he's at the vet's office.   "I'm a humper," the Doberman says. "I'll hump anything." "I'll hump the cat, a pillow, the table, whatever." "I want to hump everything I see."   Yesterday, my owner had just gotten out of the shower and was bending down to dry her toes, and I just couldn't help myself.   I hopped on her back and started humping away, taking her from Behind like crazy."   The Boxer and Labrador exchange a sad glance and say, "So, lethal injection for you too, huh?"   "No, no," the Doberman says, "I'm here to get my nails clipped."   Rather tasteless, isn't it?

      wail on brook!  i looked up the census last time around and north-east tennessee is something like 97.2 percent caucasian. so these folks feel it encumbent to gather forces together and displace the evil 2.8 percent horde of ???? asians...mexicans...canadians? what else,  african-americans?  -consider this first amendment exercise an almighty sneeze, Bill. a small booger on the sleeve of our heavenly pater-mater-what-you-ma-call-it, eventually dry-cleaned out in a blackhole run by emigre chinamen.  god does roll dice folks! i.e. sometimes, the random -ness of being bites people in the ass. sometimes it hasn't come around on the guitar yet. einstein couldn't go there (too much central european talmud for lunch or something) and everytime some jesusfreak quoth: "einstein said god doesn't roll dice" it makes me want to puke.   it would've been cool if the guy in the noose would've died of a heart attack or stroked out as the attending children took to running off flailing their arms and screaming in tongues, tripping toward the stripmall where they house child protective services (or has grover norquist drown that program already?) while the brainless buddy was seizing on the ground after being shot through.  (cue billie holiday : strange fruit,  indeed!)  oh, happy thanksgiving mutants...

      back when we were doing the beat, john and i went to the train station in bristol to observe some "light workers" present an evening of channeling. i thought we could get a story out of it and was amused john was up for attending such a new age-y jam session.  these "light workers" claimed to have been attracted to bristol and moved from, i think, baltimore -- because they said, the area [bristol] is/was situated on a "lay line," which i suppose is an energetic meridian of some sort. they talked a lot about "vortexes" (or is it vorteses?) and "energy" -- subjects which, when uttered by individuals wearing sandals of any kind, makes my brain switch off as if someone suddenly degaussed my frontal lobe. which is why i never wrote a story about it. i couldn't remember any of the experience.  now that i'm starting to recall bits and pieces, the thing about east tennessee being on a lay line -- or manifesting the world's vibrations -- is suddenly interesting. events occuring elsewhere in the world are eaten up and churned out in east tennessee. our job is simply to decode them. wow. this can be fun.  so, you've got the JC chapter of the kkk edging out michael jackson on news of the weird this week. an initiate is brought down by a bullet fired to symbolize -- what? the shooting of someone (a black man or anyone else deemed a threat) who was just hanged --  these guys are nothing if not redundant. then, the guy lives DESPITE the fact that the bullet traveled thru his head! holy shit!  maybe the "take away" here is a bit about divine intervention -- like our own little burning bush, this episode proves that the most holy one is BOTH merciful and paying attention. merciful because the racist piece of shit was spared his life (sigh, i wouldn't have played it like that). and paying attention, because maybe we might be seeing more of this "new intervention-style" in the future. maybe it's time for some old school god-action. sea parting. loaves. fishes. falafel.

      oh, brook. put your snarky-freak on and go...go...go...   why do they call it white supremacy? WHITE FOLKS: ABSOLUTE SUPREME RULERS OF STUPIDITY, CHILD ENDANGERMENT and COWARDLYness.    does the white supreme HAVE TO come with anchovies? or can you ask for them on the side?  "A bullet struck Murr on the top of the head and exited at the bottom of his skull, authorities said. "  -there was no mention of the bullet: penetrating, detouring around (oliver-stone-style) or passing through, his brain.  i saw a pbs Nova series last month about string theory and they said this is the kind of thing that happens when god throws dice and tries to roll up a hard-eight. damn uneven sidewalks!  NEW YORK, New York (AP) -- Unnamed participant and Gregory Allen Freeman to appear on the Late Show with David Letterman. They will reenact ceremony on a new segement called STUPID WHITE SUPREMACISTS semi-HUMAN TRICKS. SNAP -N- POPS will substitute for the firing of actual 9mm gunshots.  you know, shit like that or better...

      (i would say something snarky about the Darwin Awards, but really, what's the point -- brook)  _________________________________________________________________   JOHNSON CITY, Tennessee (AP) -- A bullet fired in the air during a Ku Klux Klan initiation ceremony came down and struck a participant in the head, critically injuring him, authorities said.   Gregory Allen Freeman, 45, was charged with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment in the Saturday night incident that wounded Jeffery S. Murr, 24.  About 10 people, including two children, had gathered for the ceremony. The man who was being initiated was blindfolded, tied with a noose to a tree and shot with paintball guns as Freeman fired a pistol in the air to provide the sound of real gunfire, Sheriff Fred Phillips said.  A bullet struck Murr on the top of the head and exited at the bottom of his skull, authorities said.  Freeman fled the ceremony but was arrested near his home, authorities said. He was released on $7,500 bail.

      OK, I'm beginning to believe something's just wrong with the moon. On Thursday (my day off) an FBI agent came to the JC Public Library, investigating something- apparently he wouldn't specify what- that had been done over one of the library's free to the public internet computers. Whatever set the FBI off, they tracked the IP address to the library. I also don't know when this was supposed to have taken place, but I definitely got the impression that it was just within a day or so. Then today the Johnson City Press ran this story, although this dude (well known to us all, we called him "Castro") had not been in the library for some time.  Shoplifting arrest leads to more serious charges  By Chris Garland Erwin Bureau   ERWIN — Federal agents assisted local law enforcement officers in removing sniper rifles and body armor from the apartment of a man initially wanted for shoplifting DVDs.  Boxes of ammunition, rifles, swords, a black hood, gas mask, rubber mask and pistols were some of the items removed from the 204 Gay St. apartment of Randall Douglas Griffith, 47. Unicoi County Sheriff Kent Harris and officers also found thousands of rounds of ammunition, guns and food rations in the apartment.  Also found were hundreds of books and videos, including such titles as “Contract Killer,” “Guilty by Reason of Insanity,” “Escape,” “WACO,” “Crime and Insanity,” “The Evil Messiah,” “Guide to Uncovering Cemeteries” and “Armed Robberies.” Books on Adolf Hitler, witchcraft and the Ku Klux Klan were also found.  “This proves that you need to follow up on even the smallest thing,” Harris said. “This all started as a shoplifting case where we got permission from Griffith to look for more stolen DVDs in his apartment.  “Griffith was charged Wednesday by the Erwin police for shoplifting at Downtown Video on Main Street. When Officer James White was making the arrest, Griffith opened a knife on him and he was also charged with going armed.”  Harris said a search warrant was obtained to search the apartment for other stolen items.  “We received consent and did find several stolen videos that have already been identified by Downtown Video as their property,” the sheriff said. “Hundreds of videos and DVDs also found are believed to have been stolen and we are asking other area stores to let us know what they have missing to possibly solve some of their thefts. We also found books believed to have been stolen from East Tennessee State University’s library, Unicoi County Library and the Johnson City Library.”  Griffith is expected to be arraigned in Sessions Court today. In addition to the state charges, U.S. Department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents say they intend to seek federal indictments against Griffith for being a convicted felon in possession of firearms and having body armor.  “Griffith has an extensive criminal history dating back to 1976,” Harris said. “He was convicted of felonies in California, and some were violent crimes. He has also been convicted for felonies in at least two other states.”  Harris said the weapons found in the apartment were high quality. “... Only one weapon here could be considered as a hunting rifle.  “There was a sawed-off, double-barrel shotgun and a .270-caliber Smith & Wesson rifle with a scope. These are high-dollar guns. He does not have a job ... He had in cash $2,700 on him when he was booked into the jail. I find that fact suspicious.” ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Later today, a racial-epithet slinging match between a black guy and a white guy erupted in the library, which had us all just poised on the brink of dialing 911 and now that I'm home, I  had to call the cops on a couple arguing in front of my apartment building. I didn't recognize these people at all. The guy kept yelling at the girl, "Who gave me away? Who gave me away?" He kept getting more and more in her space and when she tried to walk away from him, he threw his arm around her neck in a sort of a choke hold. They were that way when the cops drove up. The cops separated them, kept them on the sidewalk about 50 feet away from each other for a grand total of maybe two minutes, TOPS, then gave the girl about a 10-second head start and then turned the guy loose too. He took off right after her and had overtaken her before they got to the end of the block, crossed the street with her and they both disappeared in the darkness. There were three cop cars parked on my corner and they sat there, with their blues flashing, leaning up against their cars, for at least fifteen minutes AFTER they let these people go. Just yakking. I mean, obviously on a coffee break. I called this in as a heated, threatening-looking argument that I described as looking about to turn violent at any moment, and he had her in a choke hold when they came up. And this is what they did. Maybe she did say to them that she wasn't afraid of him, but that was not what her body language was saying to me. And shouldn't have said to them either. My point is, he had hands on her when they came up, how could they make the determination in that length of time that she was in no danger from him? And they watched him take off right after her, catch up with her and disappear. They had not searched either one of them for a weapon. The cops did absolutely nothing but strobe their stupid fucking lights around the neighborhood serving no purpose whatsoever except maybe to make sure nobody missed the fact that they were cops and to better highlight their ass-scratching performance art piece of  leaning on  their tax-payer provided vehicles. It was all I could do not to yell out the window, "Y'all need some donuts to go with that, boys?"

      If I have learned anything from TV in the last year, it's that drug users, even casual drug users, support terrorism. According to the commercials I see, this is because the drug trade is supporting terrorism financially. With this in mind, I must now assume that Rush Limbaugh is a supporter of Osama Bin Laden thru his abuse of Oxycontin. Perhaps that is why Bin Laden has not been caught... maybe the right wing regressives don't want him to spill the beans....so, why isn't Rush being interogated under the Patriot Act using aggresive techniques involving jumper cables, pliers and duct tape? For all we know, he could be the key to stopping the terrorist threat to America, he may be able to provide the missing link between Al Qaida and Iraq! Write your Congressman today!

      Last week Dean said that the capture of Saddam Hussien did not make America safer. Immediately right wingers declared him to be un-american just for these words. Later in the week, the State Department put Americans overseas on alert for terrorism. Today, the Department of Homeland Security raised Americas alert status here in the states... so, either the Bush admistration listens to Dean, or Tom Ridge and Colin Powell are un-american.....  Also, Quadafi states he is abandoning his Weapons of Mass Destruction program and is applauded by Bush,,, here's a thought George, "MAYBE HE IS LYING!!!"... All contributions to the Lockerbie Defense Fund should be sent to Ann Coulter....

      Just a few things:  Bobby: Thanks for your review of the New Year's Eve thing with Rob Russell and his band.   When we were doing "Whole Lotta Rosie," I of course had to do the Angus/Chuck Berry thing and run around. As soon as I jumped off the stage, I ran into a chair a woman was using for her black velvetty coat. I knocked it over into the wetness and mucky muck on the floor. Hey, I was rocking. I couldn't stop and pick it up, though I did try to prevent it from falling over. Anyway, after the second song, the show was over, and I walked by her table and noticed that she had just left the coat lying there in disgust. I turned the chair back upright and said I was sorry, but you could tell she wasn't too impressed by that.   The moral is: rock is like war. You have to expect some casualties.  Julie: Please don't worry about that job. Are you thinking that I'm mad about that? Not at all. That was just one of 30 or 40 jobs I applied to last year and didn't get. I knew it wasn't 'cause you had told 'em never to hire me.  Ok, that's it from here. And yes, Black Sabbath was a great band.   --Plez

      I spent Sunday driving around listening to Black Sabbath's first album, which always reminds me of my brother and the blue shag carpet in his bedroom--fish net hanging in the corners of the ceiling. I remember thinking when I was a kid how "evil" it sounded to my mom, so of course all us kids loved it. And now, I think I love it even more. It has got to be one of the best rock-n-roll albums out there, to this day. And I'm gaining a new appreciation for Ozzy too. I hear there's talk about making a movie about his life.   Here's a Johnson City reflection that perhaps fed the music scene in some, albeit small, way: Donnie Poole and Carmen Botkin and I were inseparable from third through sixth grade. I'd go spend the night with Carmen, who lived just up the road on Hiwassee Hill from Donnie. Seemed like the three of us were always hanging out in an old cemetery near where they lived that's now I-26. I don't know what's happened to it and haven't driven around there to see. It was just above a rock quarry dug out by workers at Magnavox that used to have a plant off the old Milligan Hwy. We'd hang out at the rock quarry too--pack backpacks with grape Nehi and food and hike down there. I remember at that cemetery most of the tombstones were old and broken, and there were big holes near graves--it was just a shambles, weeds and everything. There was one grave for a child who was stillborn, which happened to be Donnie's birthday, October 10th--can't remember the year. We'd stand there and creep ourselves out about it, then run like hell.   I also remember us playing with a Ouija board quite a bit. We'd usually go in a bedroom closet where it was dark and seemed scary. One day, we decided to hang out in Carmen's parent's bedroom closet because it was bigger and had carpet in it. I can't remember what questions we asked now at all, but at some point when things got really mysterious--the needle wasn't moving and we were waiting---Donnie reached over and turned on this electric shoe buffer that was in the closet. Me and Carmen nearly hit the ceiling, then laughed until I thought I was gonna die.    Some really great memories from growing up in JC.

      ED ANGER: MOLESTERS SHOULD BE BUTCHERED LIKE HOGS!  Ol' Sparky is too good for them!    I'M MADDER than La Toya Jackson in a talent contest at how these filthy, child-molesting vermin are being treated with kid gloves by our bleeding-heart criminal justice system.  Not only do pedophile priests get a free ride, courtesy of "understanding" bishops, but celebrities who violate our children are allowed to walk the streets free for years -- even after the whole world knows their dirty little secret.  Well, I say it stops right now.  We ought to butcher these scum like hogs. The electric chair is too good for them, if you ask me. Why should some self-respecting Mafia hit man who'd cut off his right arm before he'd hurt a kid have to sit in Ol' Sparky after it's been soiled by a cowardly piece-of-garbage child molester?  I know the liberals say that's too harsh, that these guys can be "reformed" with psychotherapy behind bars and maybe given chemical castration so when they get out, they keep their warped desires under control.  Chemical castration?

      from the Weekly World News....  A leading physicist claims to have figured out why the U.S. Postal Service loses a lot of mail and delivers most of the rest late -- post offices are "architectural anomalies" that cause time warps, wreaking havoc with letters, packages, sorting machines . . . and sometimes even mail carriers themselves.  "Blueprints don't lie, and the science is solid," Dr. Elizabeth Palterman told reporters at the conclusion of the 22nd annual Conference for Physics in Arlington, Va.  "Post offices in every state are built on scale with the base of the Great Pyramid of Cheops, an architectural 'inside joke' that began with the design and construction of a branch office in Philadelphia in 1911 and has continued unquestioned -- and with cataclysmic results -- ever since.  "What nobody realized is that the Great Pyramid is no ordinary building, even if you square off the top.  "As long as you maintain its precise foundational dimensions, even in scale, the structure you erect will create an 'energy vortex' that is capable of bending, stretching and even slowing or speeding up the flow of time.  "In layman's terms, you create the potential for a time warp, which is why so much of the mail that moves through our post offices is lost or delayed. To the casual observer, and to the naked eye, a letter or package might appear to be moving through the system at a normal pace when, in fact, it is languishing in a distortion of the space-time continuum.  "Simply put, a letter that appears to be zipping down a conveyor belt at 20 feet per second might, in fact, be taking weeks to travel that distance -- or it might just flow into another time and place altogether.  "That's why the problem of lost and late mail has been so nagging and so mysterious. You need a wall-sized blackboard and a couple of boxes of chalk just to do the math to prove what is happening."  Dr. Palterman's theory both shocked and pleased Postal Service officials who have taken so much heat over lost and slow mail over the years that they simply started blaming any problem that cropped up on the union that protects the right of postal workers to move like snails and left it at that.  "This is good news no matter how you slice it," says one postmaster in a heavily populated northeastern state.  "It proves to people that our guys, slow and lazy as they might be, aren't to blame for all these mail problems we keep having. This seems to be a solid and thoroughly scientific explanation that takes us off the hook and shows that we aren't responsible after all."  Postmaster General John Potter is said to be "keenly interested" in Dr. Palterman's assessment but he won't address it in public until the Postal Service's time-and-motion experts check the math and make sure the theory will stand up to scrutiny.  "That could take years or even decades," says a postal insider with close ties to Potter. "Energy vortex or no energy vortex, we've still got that little problem called 'the union.' We can tell our guys what to do and then they're on their own.  "If they want to drag their feet, this could take some time."  In the meantime, Dr. Palterman has suggested what she calls "a simple solution" that will end the problem of lost and delayed mail once and for all.  "All you have to do is shorten or extend one corner of every post office by one inch," says the physicist. "By taking them off the scale of the Great Pyramid, the vortices will vanish -- and the mail will move as quickly and efficiently as it does through UPS and Federal Express."

      The A.C.L.U. has filed a motion in support of Rush Limbaugh's desire to protect his medical records in the ongoing Oxycontin investigation.  In order for Limbaugh to not be a hypocrite and accept the assistance of this well know liberal organization, he should immediately release his medical records..... or recant everything he has ever said about the A.C.L.U...... this must surely be one of the signs of the apocalypse. And to think a few years ago we were told that irony is dead.

      Hey,  Does anyone out there have anything to say about the band Kings of Leon (debut album Youth and Young Manhood), or Bonnie Prince Billy?---who is also recorded under Palace and Palace Music since the early 90's? I only just heard about Kings of Leon (review below), but love BPB. Interested to hear what others have to say.  Also---I want to say something to Scott Pleasant right here about his application for a job where I work. Scott, you didn't get the job because the powers-that-be here don't know the difference between there and their, here and hear, ass and hole-in-ground. Were it up to me, you'd be here. Hear?   Here's that review: Amazon.co.uk Review  Kings of Leon are four members of the Followill family, three brothers and a cousin. The title Youth & Young Manhood is an accurate summary of their places in life--the oldest member, drummer Nathan Followill, is 23, while the youngest, bass player Jared Followill, is just 16. The brothers had a childhood that was both eccentric and peripatetic, living out of a car while their preacher father toured the southern United States, and have most recently been living in Nashville; they don't appear, judging by this startlingly assured debut, to have been unduly traumatised by either experience.   Kings of Leon, up to and including their haircuts and moustaches, are steeped in the rock & roll of the American south: Youth & Young Manhood is largely four-square boogie whose ideal setting would be a bar with sawdust on the floor and chicken wire protecting the stage. The Kings of Leon do not have a single formative influence drawn from within their own lifetimes--they clearly whiled away their father's long road trips listening to radio stations that broadcast an unleavened diet of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Creedence Clearwater Revival, the Allman Brothers and a pre-sequencers ZZ Top (although vocalist Caleb Followill sounds more than anything else like AC/DC's Bon Scott). Perhaps Youth & Young Manhood manages to be significantly more than an exercise in pastiche because the Followills are still too young to be jaded by these old noises. Whatever the reason, this is a fine start. --Andrew Mueller

      "WASHINGTON (AP) - Space-exploration proposals that President Bush is preparing to put into his next budget will not undermine his administration's goal of cutting the federal deficit in half within five years, Treasury Secretary John Snow said Sunday.   Snow said the new space proposals, which include a permanent settlement on the moon and setting a goal of sending Americans to Mars, will be undertaken ``within a framework of fiscal responsibility.''   Snow said the administration's budget, which will be sent to Congress on Feb. 2, will outline the new space proposals plus a plan that will accomplish the goal of cutting record budget deficits in half through a combination of stronger economic growth and spending restraint."  This comes from the adminstration that took your from a $300 billion surplus to a $500 billion deficit in just three years.... this must be some new meaning of "restraint" that us regular folk are not familier with....

      PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) - President Bush will announce  plans next week to send Americans to Mars and back to the moon and  to establish a long-term human presence on the moon, senior  administration officials said Thursday night.   House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, R-Texas, among others, has  called for an expansion of the U.S. space program, including a  return to the moon. The United States put 12 men on the moon  between 1969 through 1972.  An interagency task force led by Vice President Dick Cheney* has  been considering options for a space mission since summer.  *HISTORICAL NOTE: Cheney led the task force to help find a running mate for Gov. Bush in 1999, and chose himself.   rick, since you came above halo, en garde: gacy and gein were mostly into killing white gay guys or lonely white women, and never real indulged multiple choice query nor hyberbolic fantasy family units ,  as republicans prefer to just scare the shit out of for fun and profit. i don't remember ed coming outta a corner wielding a large knife and attacking law abiding liberal nuclear unit and their guilt-ridden post modern fruedian middlings.but i've never watched much tv since opie started shaving and went bald. you gotta know anyhow, most southern folks shoot first and ask questions later, no matter what their voter reg. card compels them to do.   p.s. have you tried breathe rite strips or the bose wave radio? snapple? oxycontin? latinos clean your apartment regularly? my pharmacist is a woman and she is really smart. but she won't sell syringes without prescription and there is a 25 dollar fee for bad checks- it says so right on the sign over the register. by moses! i am going to win that musket charlton heston said would have to be pried from his cold dead fingers, by god! i have joined the nra 77 times this week alone. under assumed names of course. because once asscroft figures out... the ad(t)kins (tm) wraps at subway are delicious, by the way, if you like chewey shit in a dough-napkin anyway... you can figure out where all the guns are in america if you have the nra roles...haterizing is all i know. and free-range eggs and poultry, that is.  bill, pax.  i think if you put the southern rock hall of fame in your garage or back yard, ms spears would be oops-ing and doing it again all over you like sput- on the -nik!  turn it up...

      It seems that the Mars Rover is stuck and NASA is baffled as to why. They beleive that the airbags deployed to cushion it's landing have snagged it and are trying to further deflate the bags by raising and lowering the exit ramp of the Rover.... what they don't want you to know is that this thing landed in what the Martians refer to as the East Tennessee section of Mars, and some bug-eyed space alien has already sold the wheels for drinking money and put the Rover up on blocks in his/her/it's front yard.

      So yesterday Ric and I have a discussion in the Blog about guns and today MSN has the following story:  "What do Britney Spears, the United Methodist Church, the St. Louis Rams and Hallmark Cards have in common? They're among the hundreds of celebrities, organizations and companies on the National Rifle Association's roster of entities that it considers hostile to gun-ownership rights.  The Fairfax-based NRA has compiled a 15-page list of supporters of the Brady law — which requires federally licensed gun dealers to do background checks on gun buyers — and other gun-control measures.  NRA spokesman Ted Novin said the list was solely for "informational purposes and that it's nothing new."  I ask you gentle readers, will Britney stop at nothing to get my attention?   Please Britney, it's not going to happen! How can I make it any plainer? It would never work out between us! We are from different worlds you and I, and while I am sure you are a truly wonderful person, between kissing Madonna, marrying and annulling your marriage to your friend from your home town and now this,,, well it is just all too much! So please! Let it go! I beg you!!!  And as far as the NRA saying this is nothing new.... well isn't that what you would expect them to say???

      Subject: How do you tell the difference between  Democrats,  Republicans and Southerners?   You're walking down a deserted street with your wife  and two  small children.  Suddenly, a dangerous looking man with a huge knife  comes  around the corner,  raises the knife, and charges at you.  You are carrying  a Glock .40, and you are an expert  shot.  You have mere  seconds before  he reaches you and your family.  What do you do?   Democrat's  Answer:  Well, that's not enough information to answer the  question!  Does  the man look poor or oppressed?  Have I ever  done anything to him  that  would inspire him to attack?  Could we run away?  What does my  wife think?  What about the kids?  Could I possibly swing the gun like a  club and knock  the knife out of his  hand?  What does the law say about this  situation?  Does the Glock have an appropriate safety built into  it?  Why am  I carrying a loaded gun anyway, and what kind  of message does this  send to  society and to my children?  Is it possible he'd be happy with just killing  me?  Does he definitely want to kill me, or would he be  content just to wound  me?  If I were to grab his knees and hold on, could my  family get away while  he  was stabbing me?  Should I call 9-1-1?  Why is this street so  deserted? We need to raise  taxes, have a paint and  weed day and make this a  happier, healthier street  that would  discourage  such behavior.  This  is all so confusing!  I need to debate this with  some friends for a  few  days and try to come to a consensus.   Republican's  Answer:  BANG!   Southerner's Answer:  BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!  BANG! BANG! BANG!

      My Dearest Phil,  A very eloquent, and apparently heartfelt, apology.   In all good faith, however, I feel that I cannot accept your apology. There is no reason to accept an apology for something that wasn't really an infraction. The simple facts of the matter were that you were asked a question or two by a reporter and you responded as honestly as you could. I applaud you for doing so. If everyone were to do the same, we would live in a much better place. So instead of beating yourself up about that, give yourself a pat on the back. The term "bad press" contains two words, and we were actually pleased as punch to get the "press". Hell, everyone from Al Jarreau to Whitless Spears has benefitted from bad press. My thanks to you for this.  If you really feel the need to make amends for past malfeasances, please allow me to direct your attention to the latter part of that very same article. I (and I believe I speak for most of the members of FC) took deep offense from the way that you elected to tell us that we were no longer welcome to perform at the Down Home. If, as you aver, there was no altercation between you, myself and Bruce, then there was no reason for us to suspectthat we were banned. The fact that you chose a public forum that was intended to promote the local music scene to inform Final Curtain of it's status with your club was nothing short of chickenshit. Plain old chickenshit, pussyfuck cowardice. We knew you, trusted you and, hell, a couple of us almost kinda liked you (maybe).  One thing more I will give you. At that point in time, the Down Home was the only venue we had. Thanks to your decision, we began soliciting other places to allow locals to play. I in no way shape or form want to take credit for all of this. Many voices went into the building of the JC "scene".Bruce, Johnny and Chris, The boys from Plain Jane (et.al) but I believe that is what opened the doors of QB's, Club Venus, Richard A's, and even allowed the realization of the Highlander.  So in essence, Thanks for kicking us out. Fuck you for doing it the way you did, but Thank You anyway. Many good years with many good people were had.  If whatever god you subscribe to requires you to make these apologies, at least find the right things to apologize for.

      Many JC bloggers may already be aware of this, but for those of you who aren't ( the biggest thing is a request to watch media for erroneous reporting about this - and report it):  Dear MoveOn member,  As the New Year begins, we'd rather be talking about positive things, and there are plenty of good things happening. But MoveOn.org has come under attack from the Republican National Committee (RNC), which has launched a campaign of malicious misinformation to divert attention from the creativity and power of the Bush in 30 Seconds contest. We need your help to make sure the media don't fall for it.  RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie launched the attack on "Fox News Sunday," and the RNC followed it with press releases and calls to reporters. The charges centered on two ads posted on the Bush in 30 Seconds website which compared President Bush's tactis with those of Adolf Hitler. Mr. Gillespie repeatedly referred to the ads as 'the MoveOn ad' or 'MoveOn's ad,' implying that we had sponsored or perhaps even commissioned the ad. And he also claimed that we might spend $7 million to run it on TV.  This is a lie. MoveOn.org hasn't sponsored such an ad, and we never would -- we regret the appearance of these ads on the Bush In 30 Seconds site. The two ads in question are from more than a thousand posted by members of the public, and they were voted on by MoveOn members through December 31st. Obviously the few hundred of you who viewed these ads agreed that they were not worthy of further broadcast or recognition, because they got low ratings. Yesterday we announced the 15 finalists -- all good, hard-hitting and fair appraisals of the Bush record, in the judgment of the members and others who rated them. The two offending ads can only be found one place now -- on the RNC website!  When we've explained this to journalists, most have understood that this is a game of gotcha politics, not news. But even our statement for the press below, which goes through the entire process in detail, hasn't stopped the right wing from working this angle as hard as they can.  That's why we're asking you to please watch for stories on this as they appear, and let us know. Call the news outlet yourself and give them hell for falling victim to such political baloney. I've attached our statement, which fully explains the situation, below. Then please let us know so we can contact the outlets directly.  You can help us track inaccurate reporting on this story at: http://moveon.org/smear/?id=2233-3138652-KefomeW4mN9Ec4nvuKUCuQ  Second, we need you to get the press back on the right track. After you've corrected the negative accounts, write an upbeat letter to your local paper about the exciting and positive aspects of the contest and the finalists. These ads reflect the courage, hope, and deep patriotism of our membership. They're creative, passionate, and totally unlike most of the political ads that are out there. And perhaps most importantly, they were picked in a democratic way. Now that's a story.  The finalists are online at: http://www.bushin30seconds.org/  By sharing that URL with your friends, family, and colleagues, you can help to make sure that the RNC isn't successful in stealing our finalists' glory.  Not only is the RNC campaign deceptive, it's also totally disingenuous. Yesterday, the New York Post ran a long opinion column focusing exclusively on how much Presidential Candidate Howard Dean resembles Hitler, even calling him "Herr Howie." Of course, the RNC hasn't issued a condemnation of that. When close RNC ally Grover Norquist repeatedly compared taxing the wealthy with the Holocaust in an interview on NPR, the RNC was muted. And in 2002, the RNC and its allies were silent when supporters of President Bush actually aired TV ads morphing the face of Senator Max Cleland, a triple amputee as a result of wounds sustained in Vietnam, into Osama bin Laden. Given such a transparently partisan track record, the RNC's moral outrage doesn't mean a whole lot.  Obviously, MoveOn.org and its 1.7 million members are now on the right-wing radar. They are going to do everything they can do to silence us, and we simply won't let it happen. Smear tactics and campaigns of misinformation have no place in American democracy.  Sincerely, --Adam, Carrie, Eli, James, Joan, Noah, Peter, Wes, and Zack   The MoveOn.org Team   January 6th, 2003  P.S. Here's the statement we released to the press yesterday, which explains the whole situation.  ADS ATTACKED BY RNC CHAIRMAN ARE NOT MOVEON.ORG VOTER FUND ADS MoveOn.org Voter Fund Regrets Screening Process Allowed Ads to Slip Through  Statement by Wes Boyd, Founder of MoveOn.org Voter Fund:  The Republican National Committee and its chairman have falsely accused MoveOn.org of sponsoring ads on its website which compare President Bush to Adolf Hitler. The claim is deliberately and maliciously misleading.  During December the MoveOn.org Voter Fund invited members of the public to submit ads that purported to tell the truth about the President and his policies. More than 1,500 submissions from ordinary Americans came in and were posted on a web site, bushin30seconds.org, for the public to review.  None of these was our ad, nor did their appearance constitute endorsement or sponsorship by MoveOn.org Voter Fund. They will not appear on TV. We do not support the sentiment expressed in the two Hitler submissions. They were voted down by our members and the public, who reviewed the ads and submitted nearly 3 million critiques in the process of choosing the 15 finalist entries.  We agree that the two ads in question were in poor taste and deeply regret that they slipped through our screening process. In the future, if we publish or broadcast raw material, we will create a more effective filtering system.  Contrast this with the behavior of the RNC and its allies when supporters of President Bush used TV ads morphing the face of Sen. Max Cleland (D-GA) into that of Osama Bin Laden during the 2002 Senate race.  MoveOn.org and the MoveOn.org Voter Fund exist to bring the public into the political process and produce a more fact-based election process. We regret that the RNC doesn't seem to embrace the same goals.

      (every now and then, someone emails me a dispatch to post for them. this one is from Phil Leonard, former co-owner of the Down Home and general swell guy. so good to hear from him! -- brook)  How does one go about making a proper and public apology for an infraction that is now probably 15 years old? The specific date is not important. I, Phil Leonard, made a big error when I shared my personal opinion in a public forum. I was quoted that I did not consider Final Curtain to be a band that played music. That quote of "my opinion" was correct. It was not complete. I continued to tell the "reporter" that I considered them to be practicing "performance art". That didn't show up in the article. That does not diminish how improper was my not keeping my mouth shut. And it will do no good to state whether I personally liked or disliked their shows. To this day I owe everyone that was a member of Final Curtain at the time this took place both a personal and a public apology. With Brook's permission I am using this forum as a starting place from which to issue my apology. If there is a more public place where this apology should be issued just suggest the place and I will also place an apology there. Bottom line in this thing is that I was out of line and I was responsible for statements that were not fair and had no business being shared in a local newspaper in the form it was issued. The reporter gave me a position of being something of a spokesperson on that occasion. I am ashamed that I abused that position and I regret any embarrassment and/or hurt that it caused others. In the long run I would say I embarrassed myself more that those spoken of. I was wrong. And I am sorry.  I was on the fringe of the community represented by this site. Only a person that helped in providing one of the venues for some of your adventures and undertakings. I have not been associated with the Down Home for four years now. But for nearly twenty years I did help the place to be a "variety playhouse" of sorts. A place that opened its doors to many different types of artistic expression. While the Home was offered up to the communities at large it was not owned by everyone and was not required to be everything to everybody. I feel I did help to expand the venue's choice of offerings way beyond bluegrass and old time music. Some folks in those communities thought they were betrayed when their share of booking dates became a smaller part of the calendar? The place did not want to be a bluegrass club nor a rock club. But rather to offer some of the best of both. Along with poetry, literature, film, theatre. And lots of benefits for lots of organizations. I got a real kick out of one post that offered up how the author's group made "a huge pile of money for Phil Leonard". This person should be informed that the majority of any profit seen from the door for their event went to subsidize the next three or four offerings where the door lost money. Hey, you were contributing to the larger cultural scene when your show brought in profit...not to Phil Leonard. And "thank you" for that.  While I am sincere about the apology issued above I must also offer a differing memory of yamo's recollection of being asked, along with Bruce, to leave the Down Home. I have no memory of Bruce being bloodied but I do remember making a decision that "rednecks" in attendance might not react well to slam dancers bumping into their person/table, etc. From my position at the sound booth I would venture to say I could better observe what was going on than yamo who may have even been right next to Bruce. While yamo fondly notes how many different mind altering things were a precursor to their roamings about town, it was my usual discipline to refrain from such things until after the club's doors were locked at the end of the night. In my many roles as a caretaker and host at the Down Home I had responsibilities that extended beyond the obvious. Some of the younger free spirits probably saw me as Grinch, spoil sport, evil vice-principal figure, self-righteous hall monitor...and the ugly list goes on. I remember some underage band members playing at the club were asked to meet me half way.  One was disappointed he couldn't drink his beer out in the room where all his underage contemporaries could witness his cool defiance of the law. Since I'm no longer one of the owners of the club I will issue a short disclaimer that I was the only owner responsible for allowing these underage band members to drink the beer I gave them...in the dressing room. No one could hold current owners responsible though I'm sure any statute of limitations has long expired. Anyway, this is a blog for JC Stories. And the desire by some folks to bring slam dancing to the ole Down Home, and my admitted efforts at prohibiting it from that venue was a stimulating time. I did lock horns with Bruce and I should have handled some of those situations better. But I swear I don't remember ever having a physical confrontation with anyone in all the years I spent at the club. I don't remember putting hands on anyone and don't remember ever having anyone physically assault me. But, yamo, if your memory brings you any satisfaction go with it. I suspect I gave you some reasons for your personal dislike of me. My loss there.  On a personal note to Bruce. If it matters. I always saw you as a brilliant intellect and an artist but didn't always agree that some of your directions fit in with the Down Home. I always suspected you lived with aggravations from finding yourself in a sea of bubbas who had no awareness of much beyond a triple burger and a giant slushy. I remember my image of you changing from just another young whiner complaining "there's nuthin to do in this town", to a publisher actively making shit happen! That said, neither I nor the Down Home owed anyone very much more than we gave to individuals and the communities at large. And that said, some may feel I owe them more apologies than the one expressed above. And, indeed I'm sure I'm ignorant of many of these infractions. After all. I was busy putting a full work week into a hobby of helping to run the one thing closest to a cultural arts center in JC, in addition to my day job. And I'll bet I fell victim to being pretty full of myself many times.  If this blog lasts long enough to become a chronicle of sorts some contributors might look back after more passing of time to see that: 1) Yes over indulgence and substance abuse are common traits during adolescence. 2) Giving praise to this behavior and recounting it fondly is a common trait for folks having recently moved to more restrictive adulthood situations in life (the Glory Days?). 3) A lot of the over indulgence might have actually been stupid and got in the way of seeing some of your early dreams become better expressed without quite so much and such a variety used so frequently. We pretty much ALL go through that cycle.  Hopefully we all get the chance to have our own glory days and a great group of people to share them with. The fact is your group is not the first nor the last to have such times. But that also does not diminish those days that were yours and yours alone. I suspect we would be hard pressed to find a brighter gathering of energetic and just plain good people on this planet that found themselves in one more "nowhere place" but used their own creativity to make their own scenes. I appreciate the joy I was given when I held witness to all of your "carrying on"!  So Bruce, yamo and all others offended by my statements in that certain issue of the JC Press I acknowledge my violation. I am ashamed and regretful. You have every right to not accept this apology. But I issue it here in all sincerity.  Phil Leonard

      A Johnson City Story,  So I went to see Rob Russell & the Sore Losers at Down Home this New Year’s Eve. And they were real good and everything. Some girls smoking outside claimed the band is moving to Nashville to make their fortunes this year. Surely there are a lot of JC musicians residing in Nashville with something to say about that…  Anyway, the show was good, but who brought the house down? The fuckin’ Plez by God! Plez came out late in the show with full Angus gear on, and rocked the place with “Whole Lot of Rosie.” This was the most thunderous song of the night, which brought the most thunderous applause in turn. Go Plez!

      It is reported that Britney Spears got married to a childhood friend over the weekend in Las Vegas, and further that she is already seeking annulment.... While some of the more jaded may think this is a move to create publicity to promote her album, a few of us understand the real meaning.... Oh Britney, when will you learn that you can't make me jealous? These efforts of yours to get my attention are just not working!!! It's time to move on.

      Has anyone seen this movie with Bob Dylan, John Goodman, Jessica Lange, Mickey Rourke---and, oddly, Penelope Cruz and Jeff Bridges? It just came out on DVD and has got to be the worst film I've ever seen, though some of you may disagree. Bob Dylan can't act---but, then, I'd worry if he could---and it was just full of all this trite, philosophical bullshit. It just tried way too hard. John Goodman and Jessica Lange held the damn thing together--and that's not saying much.   Glad to see Brook has returned. I think she's been, and still is, it requires much work---- exercising her political freedom with Martha Stuart pastels--turning dust ruffles into a bug-eyed monster called Dick Cheney's ass--comes with potpourri for the home---Mmmm- Smells like fascism. Trouble rolls in it. we're so happy for you Brook. You get an award.

      BBC WORLDWIDE (DATELINE Madison, WI)   Senator Kerry has recently played guitar with the musician Moby but, more than 40 years ago, the man who hopes to be the Democratic nominee for US president played bass (momma sang tenor) in a rock'n'roll band.  The band was forged in 1961 while young Master Kerry was a pupil at the exclusive St Paul's prep school in New Hampshire.  They called themselves The Electras (hisssssss...), and recorded their only album in the school's basement.  It is the first rock album ever recorded by a serious candidate for the Oval Office, according to the Washington Post. "We had this one song called 'Cows on Parade," Kerry reflected over a hot chai latte and anise biscotti on a stop in Madison, Wisconsin, "but we couldn't think of anything sexually motivating for 13 year old girls that rhymed with 'parade', so instead of creating a cross- of- jazz scat /haiku hybrid style, we chose to record it as an instrumental and we changed its title to 'Bring It On and Don't let the door hit you on the ass, on your way back to Crawford'. Who knew!"  A copy, one of only 500, recently sold on eBay in the US for over $2,500.  Another copy of the album is for sale on eBay, and after three days it has failed to excite a single bid.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- caveat: hey, i just copy and paste this shit from foreigner-type liberal media sources, i dont edit or rewrite it for effect/affect or google-blogangrandizment! or not.

      The eve of the Roman feast of Lupercalia. Naked youths would run through Rome, anointed with the blood of sacrificed dogs and goats, waving thongs cut from the goats. If a young woman was struck by the thong, fertility was assured. Pope Gelasius I decided this was a bit too much, and co-opted the Roman holiday to be the Feast of St. Valentine in 484 A.D.

      Still whining after all these years, eh Phil?  Are you by chance suggesting that our presence in your "Listening Room" (Listen to that...its the sound of horseshit hitting the old dusty trail) somehow jeapordized  the integrity of, or lowered the value of, your bar?  We LOVED your place, Phil.  Why do you think we showed up and payed those outrageous covers?  And PLEEEASE dont give me any crap about paying your overhead...I DONT CARE...15 dollars to see Webb Wilder is simply TOO FUCKING MUCH TO PAY, regardless of how many loans you had taken...But pay it we did, repeatedly...One part of my story you seemed to have overlooked is the fact that you were tossing ME out of your bar even after I had been beaned with a Molson bottle..and the guy who hit me just sailed merrily on...you didnt even TRY to figure out who did it...and didnt check to see if I was okay...I WAS, but I very well could have been injured...and you gave not a whit, you just wanted us out of your bar before we could anger another of your preferred customers...hmph, should have sued your happy ass...thats what you thought of us and thats why we treated you the way we did, in a nutshell...and you reacted to it so WELL...Honestly, I believe you were much too high strung to be in the business you were in...The Down Home  has never been more vibrant and alive as it was in those days...you were on the cutting edge Phil!...you  had to be dragged there kicking and screaming, but for one brief shining moment, there you were.  Then it was back to Doc Watson falling off his tractor. Plop!  Oh, how endemic of the condition of the noble Appalachian man!  Wait, he's getting up again...PLOP!...Oh, brilliant!

      Well gosh I thought I felt my ears burning. Phil youve got nothing to apologize for.  In case you havent caught on yet, we ENJOYED pulling your chain.  Defying the "evil vice-principal" was part of the fun, and you were just so S-E-R-I-O-U-S all the time it was really hard to resist.  ("Listening Room" my ass)  James wants to make this into some kind of tragedy..."We knew you...we TRUSTED you..." sob sniff pass the hanky Jethro...but the simple fact is...well...we were just fuckin with ya, man!  On the night in question...I had downed some sort of mystery nerve pills and yamo and I were sharing a bottle of really cheap tequila...I remember Webb Wilder was playing, but my memory gets kind of fuzzy after that...I remember seeing double...the band played a song I liked...ironically, I wasnt trying to mosh ("slam dance" ...havent heard that in a while...)  I was just too wasted to stand and I jostled some rednecks table, spilling his beer...he promptly responded by breaking the empty bottle over my head...I remember hitting the floor, and then at least three Phils looking down at me sternly, and shouting...something..."You guys need to relax..." I may have thought or said or mumbled...Phil helped me up and began hustling me towards the door and there suddenly was James in between us, and Phil was shouting something about getting along fine without us and gosh wasnt James a good friend for valiantly defending me from...something...and there was a lot of chest-bumping and attitude slinging and it amounted to nothing more.  The next thing I really remember was sitting on the curb outside the club combing glass from my hair and asking people what the hell just happened.  As for your comments about Final Curtain in...what was it...the Incest County Monthly Gazette?...you were asked to state YOUR OPINION...you could have said "Final Curtain covers themselves with warm steamy caribou droppings.  Thrice daily.  In water."... and that would have been a-1 charlie roger hokay with me there, G.I....trust me when I say that nobody remembers that little article, and even at the time nobody much gave half a whistling fuck what any of us thought about anything. And as for your assesment of me..."brilliant?"  "artist?" ...how about..."Nerdy-guy-who-wasnt-talented-enough-to-get-a-decent-band-together-but-wanted-to-suck-up-to-that-crowd-anyhow-because-thats-where-all-the-choice-PUSSY-was-to-be-found". Yep, that about sums it up. And for the record, I was permanently banned from the Down Home no less than three times.

      Well, I'm wondering where all the blog women have gone, especially since there aren't many of us to begin with. I think I'll write a song, but not now.   To those of you who know guitars, I interviewed the owner of Andrew Instruments today. He makes guitars, mandolins, dulcimers and dobros in Elizabethton and has for the last 10 years. Just this past year, Ghrun (sp?) guitars in Nashville started selling his stuff. Didn't know if anyone on the blog had heard of him. His name is Dewey Cornett. Told me he's giving a dobro to Jerry Douglas when he comes to the Down Home.  Below are a couple of haikus (well, not really) concerning Brook's whereabouts:  She’s sipping from a cup of subversion and spitting supernovas through her two front teeth.  She's humming and handing out flourescent, self-thumping Bibles to state lawmakers

      Opps, it appears I was wrong yesterday. Actually the released record shows that Bush served 14 days from 5/72 thru 4/73, with a span of 5 months in which he did not report for service. Also, he was to serve 15 days plus one weekend per month, not 37 days. My bad, sorry George. But I am still confused as to how 14 = 39. Is that some of that no child left behind fuzzy math I keep hearing about??  Also, Josh, a Newfoundland took best of show at the Westmeinster. Presumably, Rush Limbaugh will be releasing a statement this afternoon that Josh won as the liberal media needed a black dog to succeed.....

      Bush has now released his service record that shows he drilled with the National Guard a total of 9 days from 5/72 thru 5/73. He owed 37 days for this time period apparently. This was released to prove that he was not awol. I'm confused.

      A father watched his daughter playing in the garden. He smiled as he reflected on how sweet and innocent his little girl was. Suddenly she just stopped and stared at the ground. He went over to her and noticed she was looking at two spiders mating. "Daddy, what are those two spiders doing?" she asked. "They're mating," her father replied. "What do you call the spider on top, Daddy?" she asked. "That's a Daddy Longlegs." Her father answered. "So, the other one is Mommy Longlegs?" the little girl asked. "No," her father replied. "Both of them are Daddy Longlegs." The little girl thought for a moment, then took her foot and stomped them flat and said "Well, we're not gonna have any of that shit in our garden."

      Here's one I heard recently. By the way, has anyone seen or heard from Brook?  Three Texas surgeons were playing golf together and discussing surgeries they had performed. One of them said, "I'm the best surgeon in Texas. A concert pianist lost 7 fingers in an accident, I reattached them, and 8 months later he performed a private concert for the Queen of England."   One of the others said, "That's nothing. A young man lost both arms and legs in an accident, I reattached them, and 2 years later he won a gold medal in field events in the Olympics."   The third surgeon said, "You guys are amateurs. Several years ago a cowboy who was high on cocaine and alcohol rode a horse head-on into a train traveling 80 miles an hour. All I had left to work with was the horse's rear end and a cowboy hat. Now he's President of the United States."

      The White House has reversed it's "policy" and now Condee Rice will testify before the 9/11 committee. Of course this policy was that National Security Advisors would not testify before Congress, which is confusing because Clinton and Carter's both did (perhaps they had nothing to hide) and the Committee is not part of Congress anyway,,, oh well, in any event it appears that the White House is ready to present it's final version of the story and we will hear but a few more flip flops on the truth from them on this particular issue.  What bugs me about this story is that the White House has denied being caught unready by 9/11. It takes offense that anyone would say that terrorism was not the main priority prior to the attack. Well, of course it wasn't. Why would it have been? While I fault Bush for alot of things, including not listening to his advisors on the terrorism issue, I cannot beleive that the exact events of 9/11 were anticipated, and the only reason to keep waffleing on testifying before the committee would be that the White House had information that an event such as 9/11 were to happen, and did nothing to prevent it,,,,, .............. wait a minute.......  hhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmm

      A word of advice to anyone who is thinking about voting for Ralph (The Spoiler) Nader:  Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader is getting a little help from his friends – and from George W. Bush's friends."  Nearly 10 percent of the Nader contributors who have given him at least $250 each have a history of supporting the Republican president, national GOP candidates or the party, according to computer-assisted review of financial records by The Dallas Morning News.  Among the new crop of Nader donors: actor and former Nixon speechwriter Ben Stein, Florida frozen-food magnate Jeno Paulucci and Pennsylvania oil company executive Terrence Jacobs. All have strong ties to the GOP.   Democrats have warned that Mr. Nader's entry in the race could help Mr. Bush by drawing votes from John Kerry. Some analysts say Mr. Nader's third-party candidacy four years ago siphoned off Democratic voters and cost Vice President Al Gore the White House.  "Republicans are well aware that Ralph Nader played a spoiler role in the 2000 election. And there is no reason why they wouldn't want to encourage and help him do so again in 2004," said Jano Cabrera, a spokesman for the Democrat National Committee.   A spokesman for the Bush campaign declined to comment on Mr. Nader.   "We're focused on our campaign. We're focused on generating support for Republican candidates," said Danny Diaz, referring inquiries about Nader fund raising to his donors.   Republicans who have given to Mr. Nader offered a variety of explanations, including a desire to provide voters a choice in November and to highlight the consumer advocate's issues. Some donors said they were miffed by efforts, primarily Democrats, to keep Mr. Nader off the ballot.   None said their donations were designed to boost Mr. Bush's chances in the fall.   "Did I give $1,000 to Ralph Nader because I hope and believe he will be president? No," said California business executive Charles Ashman. "I don't believe that any more than Ralph Nader does. But I was offended to see this campaign to squelch him from being a candidate."   Mr. Ashman said he remains a staunch Republican. He contributed $2,000 to the Bush campaign, the maximum allowed for the general election, according to records.   "I proudly made a contribution to the re-election of President Bush because I support him 100 percent," he said. "I hope and believe he will be re-elected."   Read the article, but first take some prophylactic Pepto-Bismol.  Wouldn't want anyone to puke on their keyboards.

"Republicans are well aware that Ralph Nader played a spoiler role in the 2000 election. And there is no reason why they wouldn't want to encourage and help him do so again in 2004," said Jano Cabrera, a spokesman for the Democrat National Committee.   A spokesman for the Bush campaign declined to comment on Mr. Nader.   "We're focused on our campaign. We're focused on generating support for Republican candidates," said Danny Diaz, referring inquiries about Nader fund raising to his donors.   Republicans who have given to Mr. Nader offered a variety of explanations, including a desire to provide voters a choice in November and to highlight the consumer advocate's issues. Some donors said they were miffed by efforts, primarily Democrats, to keep Mr. Nader off the ballot.   None said their donations were designed to boost Mr. Bush's chances in the fall.   "Did I give $1,000 to Ralph Nader because I hope and believe he will be president? No," said California business executive Charles Ashman. "I don't believe that any more than Ralph Nader does. But I was offended to see this campaign to squelch him from being a candidate."   Mr. Ashman said he remains a staunch Republican. He contributed $2,000 to the Bush campaign, the maximum allowed for the general election, according to records.   "I proudly made a contribution to the re-election of President Bush because I support him 100 percent," he said. "I hope and believe he will be re-elected."   Among the new crop of Nader donors: actor and former Nixon speechwriter Ben Stein, Florida frozen-food magnate Jeno Paulucci and Pennsylvania oil company executive Terrence Jacobs. All have strong ties to the GOP.  Read the article, but first take some prophylactic Pepto-Bismol.  Wouldn't want anyone to puke on their keyboards.

      So, Richard Clarke, former Anti Terrorism chief for Bush has written a book saying that Bush wanted to blame 9/11 on Iraq all along. This book has been enough to send the Bush folks into a hissy fit, and has brought Condee Rice and "Dick" Cheney out to argue this in the media. Rice claimed on CNN that Clarke did not know what he was talking about as "he wasn't involved in most" meetings where such issues were discussed. "Dick" went on the Rush Limbaugh show yesterday and was interviewed by a known drug abusing social parasite, this gist of his position being that Clarke "wasn't in the loop on alot of this stuff."  So we are left with one of two positions to believe;  1) Clarke is telling the truth, Bush set his sites on Iraq without regard to any involvement on Iraq's part in the 9/11 attack, or;  2) The Bush anti-terroism program was developed without the antiterrorism chief being in the loop.  Ya know, neither one of these possiblities is very comforting, in fact, I have to wonder why Bush would want to draw attention to this failure by arguing with it....  Clarke by the way was originally appointed by Reagan, and served thru Bush the first and Clinton, so apparently 3 prior presidents valued his insight and wisdom. Too bad this one didn't.

      post-haste I sense plenty of rancour in the cooter chakra (or Swadisthana; aka: FCC'ing region) of this blog. I feel somewhat responsible, but not really. I just sorta wanted to make fun of the "if you see Kay" direction we have gone in. maybe we should colloquialize things a bit  and say I was FCC'ed-over by the man, instead of " I was fucked over by the man..." etc...  maybe even howard stern could say "FCC you and the horse you rode in on, FCCing Powell-hole!" and not get into trouble, lenny bruce would laugh and stick up three digits on his left hand and say "read between the lines pataki, 2 lil' 2 late!,  why is the word B U S H not obscene?"  peace to us all. let's turn our collective frown upside down. and in the bedroom arts, not all at once but, one on one, maybe, at least... let's be ameri-cans, not ameri-can'ts.

      I should note that my last bile spewing rant was directed at three groups, those talking heads that are not in fact journalists (if it requires hairspray and mousse to do it then it probably ain't journalism), those print media elitists that won’t let a fact get in the way of their right wing rich guy bias, and those who still think there is any liberalism left in the dominant media, It was specifically NOT directed at those innumerable hard working underpaid local reporters who are just trying to do an important job with both some measure of integrity and dignity and often go under appreciated by raving loons like myself. If you can write a bitchin’ haiku, you can assume it was not directed at you. Just wanted to make that clear, as on my way home today it occured to me that  I was painting with a fairly wide brush there, and that at least a couple of people that post on here are in fact reporters, and either of whom could probably kick my ass in a bar fight.

      USA Today has announced that one of its long time reporters has resigned from the paper and has been found to have fabricated stories, notably those involving terrorism and al-queda. The reporter, Jack Kelly, was a finalist for a Pulitzer prize and a speaker at  the "Evangelical Press Association."   Also in today's Tennessean, an article that WTVF of Nashville ran a film provided by the Bush adminstration which simulated a news report but was in fact a PR film that touted the joys the republican medicare plan. WTVF was one of several stations around the country that fell for this ruse. Essentially, the film conned viewers into beleiving that the stations reporters had investigated the medicare scheme and found it to be wonderful, when in fact, it was all actors hired by the Bush adminstration. This does not appear to violate the First Ammendment, as the Constitution allows the media the freedom to be stooges for Bush and Co if they so choose.  Between reporters fabricating terrorism stories and television stations being no more than mouth pieces for the right wing, one wonders if there are any media outlets that hold the public trust with any value anymore. As Tom Clancey said, "Why should I beleive you? You're a reporter."

      just think how wonderful life would be if the bush team took command of "the price is right"? besides bob barker getting unemployment for 4 years and then falling off the dole bc he couldnt find work and  therefore no longer counting as unemployed, no contestant would ever loose technically: no faith based contestant left behind would kick in. and if they didn't die in Iraq they could come home and join the VFW. the ladies who point at products would be indian chicks who would work for real cheap, sweet! and as long as no one had to guess at the price of oil or natural gas, a few contestants might win valuable prices ...and Johnny could tell them all the details...  but seriously, if the fcc wants to get tough on four-letter words, why not start with  B U S H...

      I'm confused. Can't major networks now use fuck in dialogue as long as it's used as an adjective, not a verb? Wasn't that a recent decision? See below AP story.  ?????   And it just continues to highlight why I have this love/hate relationship with, not just Christianity, but everything - because no one in power seems to realize that a religion based on categories like Use of profanity = hell fire and damnation; black/white; etc. is insane. My brain STILL tries to fit shit into these fucked-up packages. I fight it on a daily basis. But it's all o.k. because on my death bed I can always ask for forgiveness and "get saved" for the upteenth time. I tried to explain this to a very well-meaning woman at a bible study---the black/white, polarity problem with Christianity and how it butchers the psyche. I asked her if she could describe her personality in terms of this/that---happy/sad--etc. I tried to explain to these women that reality and people are full of "contradictions" and that it's all a language problem, nevermind getting into biblical translation of the original Greek and Hebrew.   They all just stared at me and I guess it suddenly "came clear" to them in their small minds why I'm "single and without children".   What about separation of church and state?   FCC cites Howard Stern and Bono for indecency WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators opened a new front in their crackdown on offensive broadcasts Thursday, saying that almost any use of the F-word on over-the-air radio and television would be considered indecent. The Federal Communications Commission overruled its staff and said an expletive uttered by rock singer Bono on NBC was both indecent and profane. It marked the first time that the FCC cited a four-letter word as profane; the commission previously equated profanity with language challenging God’s divinity. The FCC on Thursday also proposed maximum fines for the broadcast of the Howard Stern radio show and for a program on two Florida radio stations owned by a Clear Channel Communications subsidiary.

      The Bush camp says that if Kerry is elected he will raise taxes by $900 billion. Kerrys says if elected he will let end only the tax break given to those making over $200,000 a year. If we accept that both of these are true statements, (and there is really no reason to suppose anymore that Bush has ever told the truth about anything) then we are left with one unavoidable conclusion....   Bush cut taxes for those motherfuckers by 900 billion fucking dollars!!! I just can't believe that any body could be that irresponsible!! Fuck! We have a war on terrorism, a war on Iraq, crippling unemployment, and a myriad of other problems and these fuckers give the richest americans a 900 billion fucking dollar tax break!!! Maybe thats why the deficit has gone thru the fucking roof since these rocket scientists took office!! And these are the same rich fuckers that are sending jobs overseas to create even more unemployment.. fuck! (Did I scream fuck yet???)   Do these bastards hate America so much they want to fucking bankrupt it? Or do they hate children so much they want every dollar our children and grand children ever earn go towards paying these cheap fuckers fucking bills? cheap shit bastards....

      We know now that according to the US Secratary of Education that the NEA is a terrorist group, We know that Laura Bush was a school librarian, and thus probably a NEA member. Please feel free to call The Department of Homeland Security and report this,,, except Roland,, you might not want to with your job and all....  Speaking of terrorists, it seems that after 9/11 the government quietly assisted certain Saudis in the US out of the country, even though americans were unable to fly at the time. Could it be because the Bin Ladens invested so heavily in George Bush's first business that this favor was done????

      DAYTON, Tenn.  — Rhea County commissioners unanimously voted to ask state lawmakers to introduce legislation amending Tennessee's criminal code so the county can charge homosexuals with crimes against nature.  We need to keep them out of here," said Commissioner J.C. Fugate, who introduced the motion.  County Attorney Gary Fritts also was asked by Fugate to find the best way to enact a local law banning homosexuals from living in Rhea County.  The Rhea County action came after the Senate Judiciary Committee (search) voted 7-1 Tuesday for a bill that would prohibit legal recognition of civil unions and domestic partnerships among homosexuals in Tennessee. Gay marriages already are prohibited in the state.  The state senator who represents Rhea County, Tommy Kilby, D-Wartburg, said Wednesday he hadn't seen the resolution and couldn't comment on it until he did.  "Yesterday in Judiciary Committee, they passed out a bill basically saying we will not recognize same-sex partnerships or civil unions from other states or foreign countries. I voted for that, and that's my position on that issue," Kilby said.  State Rep. Jim Vincent couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday.  Rhea County, about 30 miles north of Chattanooga, is among the most conservative in Tennessee. It holds an annual festival commemorating the 1925 trial that convicted John T. Scopes on charges of teaching evolution, a verdict thrown out by the Tennessee Supreme Court on a technicality. The trial later became the subject of the play and movie, "Inherit the Wind."  In 2002, a federal judge ruled unconstitutional the Rhea County school board's Bible Education Ministry...  okay, this would be funny if it was in Alabama or Georgia, but come on, Rhea County Tennessee? Inherit Wind-Again?A SEQUEL!!!!!  I was fixing to order an ETSU ball cap to celebrate them making the NCAA basketball fuckfest, so i could spit in the eye of all these Kentucky fans around town (on bad hair days,) yeah, i am somebody, i paid very little for my education thank you very much. but , but nay, our second name is Tennessee. and our town is wall to wall homo's like a damn Dr. Suess book...what doesn't rhyme with gay?   Now I must pause and sort out the humanity. I once lived in chitown, I have seen the apartment of Clarence Darrow (from a CTA bus window, folks in chicago are unaware that we used to flatter ourselves and loose the rumor that our hovel was "little Chicago").  I wonder if Mr. Kilby eats a lot of radishes? Who will be the Mencken? banjo fuckers...

One wonders if he will use this to make up for one of the days he owes for the year he deserted. And since he usually charges $2500 a plate to eat with him, I wonder if this is how Halliburton is planning to make up for the $300,000,000 the Pentagon is holding for over charges.....

Immediately country radio stations dropped The Dixie Chicks from thier playlists and there were calls for boycotts by the Republican panties in a wad crowd. A feud ensued with other country musicians, most notably Toby Keith.  The ballots are in and the people have spoken. Last year The Dixie Chicks were the largest grossing act in country music at $39,200,000, beating out such notables as the aforementioned Toby Keith and yes, even Britney Spears (in fairness Britney took the year off to plan a wedding and generally conspire to get my attention.)

      U.S. Atty. General John Ashcroft had his gallbladder removed today in a 90-minute procedure that doctors pronounced successful.  Ashcroft, 61, was hospitalized last Thursday with severe pancreatic inflammation caused by gallstones. Removal of the gallbladder — which stores and regulates bile — is the common treatment for his condition to avoid recurring blockages.  Bruce Abell, Ashcroft's surgeon at George Washington University Hospital, said the attorney general tolerated the laparoscopic procedure "very well," and was in "guarded" or "code blue" condition (aka tinky winky), which he said was expected.   "Long term, he should have a complete recovery," Abell said. "His 'gall' is still intact, but he is going to have to limit his fatty food intake."

      After recently getting 3 t.v. channels, I'm so amazed by the increased level of intelligence (i.e.a proclivity toward ignoring certain basic moral values) now available to Americans through "reality-based" television. I just love the thought that millions of viewers are encouraged daily to renounce such nasty qualities as altruism and compassion by watching shows like Average Joe. It's such a great way to reinforce a Republican, "Christian" agenda. I mean, I just can't stop smiling and had to share. Thank you.

      On February 26, 2001, Paul Bremer said, "The new administration seems to be paying no attention to the problem of terrorism. What they will do is stagger along until there's a major incident and then suddenly say, 'Oh, my God, shouldn't we be organized to deal with this?' That's too bad. They've been given a window of opportunity with very little terrorism now, and they're not taking advantage of it. Maybe the folks in the press ought to be pushing a little bit."

       http://www.templeofblackjesus.com/new_stuff.html    Greenville, SC--Mel Gibson's controversial film about the last hours of Christ's life has aroused both praise and condemnation around the world. According to studio estimates it has earned nearly $300 million in it's first few weeks. But as the christian suburban population has poured into view Gibson's portrayal, the urban demographic has been less moved by the fanfare.   That all change last Wednesday when Jerome "Jay-Jay" Perkins mistakenly stumbled into the middle of the 9:30pm showing of "The Passion" at Cinemark Cinema, becoming the first black patron ever to view the film.  "I was looking at that zombie movie "Dawn of the Deads" when I had to go to the baffroom", relayed a confused Jerome. "I done snuck in a few Old E's and I had to piss like a muthfukka!", said Jerome grabbing his crotch with a mischievous grin. But unfortunately for Jerome and the employees of Cinemark Cinema he did not make it to the restroom, drunkenly relieving himself in a plastic potted plant in the lobby. Miraculously avoiding detection, Jerome stumbled back to the theater area, entering "The Passion of the Christ" by mistake. "I saw this bloody fool up on the screen, looking all fucked up", said Perkins explaining his blunder.   Patrons line up to see  "The Passion", unaware of the crazy black man that will bless their cinematic experience.   But after an hour Mr. Perkins discovered the error of his ways, that he was in the wrong theater, "I says "Where the hell all the other damn zombies at? And why ain't nobody gots kilt yet?!" The inebriated Perkins became belligerent and started shouting obscenities, finally throwing his empty 40oz bottle at the screen. After some commotion he was escorted from the theater by Cinemark staff.   Questioned after the incident about being the first black person in America to view "The Passion of the Christ" Jerome responded, "That was some bullsheeeeit, Jebus got his ass kicked

The poll found that if the presidential election due in November was held today, 46 percent of Americans would vote for Democrat John Kerry and 44 percent would vote for Bush

      Howdy folks. I copied this from The Village Voice. A more left-wing rag you’re unlikely to find. And yet they officially called for Kerry’s replacement in yesterday’s edition. They write:   John Kerry Must Go Note to Democrats: it's not too late to draft someone—anyone—else April 27th, 2004 11:45 AM  WASHINGTON, D.C.— With the air gushing out of John Kerry's balloon, it may be only a matter of time until political insiders in Washington face the dread reality that the junior senator from Massachusetts doesn't have what it takes to win and has got to go. As arrogant and out of it as the Democratic political establishment is, even these pols know the party's got to have someone to run against George Bush. They can't exactly expect the president to self-destruct into thin air.   With growing issues over his wealth (which makes fellow plutocrat Bush seem a charity case by comparison), the miasma over his medals and ribbons (or ribbons and medals), his uninspiring record in the Senate (yes war, no war), and wishy-washy efforts to mimic Bill Clinton's triangulation gimmickry (the protractor factor), Kerry sinks day by day. The pros all know that the candidate who starts each morning by having to explain himself is a goner.   What to do? Look for the Dem biggies, whoever they are these days, to sit down with the rich and arrogant presumptive nominee and try to persuade him to take a hike. Then they can return to business as usual—resurrecting John Edwards, who is still hanging around, or staging an open convention in Boston, or both.   If things proceed as they are, the dim-bulb Dem leaders are going to be very sorry they screwed Howard Dean.

      What if the elderly on that bus, instead of going to Canada to get thier meds, joined the Texas Air Guard to get them, then went AWOL and deserted in Alabama? Would the FDA sanction that???

      Certain neo cons are saying that Kerry should shoot straight with the people about throwing his medals on the capitol steps, hhhhhmmm last time he shot straight he killed 20 Viet Cong; does that clear up the medal issue for you? or do you need to know how many enemy soldiers were killed from air raids in Texas??

      "WASHINGTON - A senior Food and Drug Administration official said Wednesday that it was unfortunate his agency stopped and inspected a busload of seniors returning from a medicine-buying trip to Canada.  "This is not consistent with our current practice," said John Taylor, the FDA's associate commissioner for regulatory affairs. "I would not expect it to happen again."  The FDA says it cannot guarantee the safety of medications purchased in Canada and has been increasing pressure on state and local programs that help people buy the lower-cost prescription drugs there.  The bus-stopping incident occurred in October but wasn't made public until Wednesday, when Sen. Mark Dayton, D-Minn., wrote to the FDA to complain about it. Dayton, a millionaire, donates his entire Senate salary to pay for the bus trips from Minnesota, allowing seniors to take advantage of the much lower drug prices in Canada."  note to comment pop-up... we know, we know, rick will probably say all old people suck (except for pat boone and ronnie reagan) and should be taken out and shot. okay we got it.  but hey, if folks go to canada to buy drugs, they are spending their own money, and not tax payer money for overpriced american products that are EXACTLY the same god damn thing!  and we know, scaring them is not the same as shooting them, but has a similar effect on their undergarments.

      Damn, Pat Boone, personal embodiment of evil,,,,, who would have ever thought it.......  Have enjoyed the blog the past week, though I have not had time to post to it, and I look forward to further sermons. Does anyone else find it surreal that Bush Inc. is questioning one of Kerry's Purple Hearts? Are they trying to say that making a Texas beer run is as dangerous as getting shot at by Viet cong? And why is it that all the White House folks that have attacked Kerry's war record are the ones that themselves never served at all? You havent heard Powell say anything about it at all,, but Chickenhawk Cheney has questioned if one of the three purple hearts was legitimate. Its as though I am listening to a losing player following a high school football game saying "Sure they beat us 45 to nothing, but that field goal shouldnt count cause the noseguard was off sides,,,,"

      Finally, i understand why entertainers shouldn't share their political opinions.   The below quote is from Washington Times, home to serious nutjob journalists, note the details regarding the fashion sense of Mr. Boone. The first photo is from billybarty.com and that is the only reason i put it down there.  "I don't think censorship is a bad word, but it has become a bad word because everybody associates it with some kind of restriction on liberty," said Mr. Pat Boone, who is in Washington making the rounds as the national spokesman for the 60-Plus Association, a conservative senior citizen lobby.     "But we do know that at some point a line that has to be drawn between one man's liberty and another man's license."     Mr. Boone, a lifelong, devout Christian who turns 70 in June, also touched on his dealings with Elvis Presley when the two were up-and-coming singers in the 1950s, an early Ronald Reagan rally, and the film "The Passion of the Christ" in a 90-minute interview with editors and reporters at The Washington Times.     The Federal Communications Commission has wrestled with censorship regarding broadcast decency recently, putting broadcast licensees on notice last month that indecent broadcasts "will lead to forfeitures and potential license revocation."     Mr. Boone said that if he were in charge of standards, there would be stringent controls on material.        "It must be majority approved ... voluntary ... and self-imposed," he said, clad in a yellow blazer, black slacks, a canary yellow tie and white leather shoes. "Censorship is healthy for any society, and that goes for arts, entertainment, anything. Self-imposed means that the majority of people say that is what we want, and it can be changed if people's attitudes change, which is how a democratic society works."     Figures like radio announcer Howard Stern, who has been fined and his show banned from several stations for broadcasts that have been called offensive and vulgar, "shows no discipline and no self-restraint at all."     When Mr. Boone was invited to appear on Mr. Stern's radio show several years ago, the singer agreed, but with a simple stipulation.     "I said that I will if Howard will give me just a gentleman's promise that he will not say anything filthy about my wife or my daughter Debbie then I'll come on. He wouldn't even do that, so I did not go on. I said that if I did go on and he said scandalous things about my family I would be forced to walk out or punch him in his big nose."     Of Mr. Reagan, Mr. Boone recalled an anticommunism rally about 40 years ago when a speech by the future president stirred him.     "I remember we were leaving, my wife, Shirley, and I, and I said, 'Man, it's too bad a guy like Ronald Reagan doesn't run for office,' " he recalled. Mr. Reagan became governor of California a short time later, in 1967.     Mr. Boone has always been what he is: unapologetically inoffensive, a man in white bucks and sweater who cranked out 1950s pop hits that were the antidote to the renegade that was Presley. He still holds the Billboard magazine record of 200 consecutive weeks on the charts with more than one song at a time holding down a slot.     When he and Presley shared a bill at a 1955 sock hop in Cleveland, Mr. Boone already had a hit with "Two Hearts and Two Kisses." But he had heard things about the young, hillbilly singer from Tupelo, Miss.     "I was backstage and Elvis came in with his entourage. He had one even then," Mr. Boone said. "I had on my nice clothes, a tie and a button-up shirt my white buck shoes and he had his collar turned up and his hair was long and greasy. And I said to him, 'Hi, I'm Pat Boone.' And he had this weak, wet handshake and he kind of mumbled something to me, he was very insecure."     Years later, Mr. Boone ran into Presley, who was then approaching deity as far as the music world was concerned.     "I reminded him of that meeting in Cleveland, and he said 'I didn't know what to say to you, you were at the top of the charts.' "     A more serious meeting of celebrities was when Mr. Boone was invited to a private screening of Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ."     "After the screening was over, I turned and said, 'Mel, you're an apostle,' " said Mr. Boone, who has appeared in 15 films. "An apostle is one commissioned by God to tell the story and you are telling it more powerfully than it has ever been told or will ever be told, and you are therefore an apostle."     "I consider it the most important film ever made. It is a film that is not only of gigantic proportion but one that changes life, that affects people's eternal destiny."      the only thing left to ask pat is: when jesus comes, you gonna spit or swallow?

      On April 12, 2002, two Greenpeace activists boarded a commercial ship several miles off the coast of Florida. The ship was carrying illegally exported Brazilian Mahogany. The protestors were going to hang a banner on the ship that read "President Bush: Stop Illegal Logging."  Ashcroft has launched an outrageous legal attack against Greenpeace, indicting the organization for the peaceful protest activities of its members under an obscure 1872 "sailor-mongering" law.  The trial is set to begin May 17, and will mark the first time a public interest organization has faced criminal charges over the protest activities of its members. This is the criminalization of dissent.

      "A military contractor has fired Tami Silicio, a Kuwait-based cargo worker whose photograph of flag-draped coffins of fallen U.S. soldiers was published in Sunday's edition of The Seattle Times.  Silicio was let go yesterday for violating U.S. government and company regulations, said William Silva, president of Maytag Aircraft, the contractor that employed Silicio at Kuwait International Airport.  "I feel like I was hit in the chest with a steel bar and got my wind knocked out. I have to admit I liked my job, and I liked what I did," Silicio said.  Her photograph, taken earlier this month, shows more than 20 flag-draped coffins in a cargo plane about to depart from Kuwait. Since 1991, the Pentagon has banned the media from taking pictures of caskets being returned to the United States.  Maytag also fired David Landry, a co-worker who recently wed Silicio."  more: http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2001909527_coffin22m.html

      had to edit and repost to lend context to future...in future posts, you can reference relevant commandments (see who hates freedom most) so we can track our fall.  "Recently a political scientist, Dr. Lawrence Britt, wrote an article naming fourteen characteristics of fascism. He based his study on an examination of the regimes of Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Suharto and Pinochet. (For the record, we need to remind ourselves that four of these men were Roman Catholics never excommunicated by their church—all except Suharto.) A summary of Britt’s points follow.  1. Powerful and continuing nationalism employing constant use of patriotic slogans, symbols, songs, flags. 2. Disdain for the recognition of human rights because security needs outweigh human rights which can be ignored. 3. Using enemies as scapegoats for a unifying cause. 4. Supremacy of the military. 5. Rampant sexism including more rigid gender roles and anti-gay legislation. 6. Controlled mass media. 7. Obsession with national security driven by a politics of fear. 8. Religion and Government are intertwined especially in rhetoric employed by its leaders. 9. Corporate power is protected—industrial and business aristocracies put government leaders into power and keep them there creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite. 10. Labor power, which represents one of the few threats to fascism, is suppressed. 11. Disdain for intellectuals and the arts and hostility to higher education along with censorship of arts or refusal to support the arts. 12. Obsession with crime and punishment. 13. Rampant cronyism and corruption. 14. Fraudulent Elections."  humbly stolen from the author Matthew Fox

When your wife is in the kitchen doing dishes, stand fifteen feet behind her and ask her a question, if she doesn’t respond keep moving closer asking the question until she hears you.” The man goes home and sees his wife preparing dinner. He stands fifteen feet behind her and says, “What’s for dinner, honey?” He gets no response, so he moves to ten feet behind her and asks again. Still no response, so he moves to five feet. Again, no answer. Finally he stands directly behind her and says, “Honey, what’s for supper?” She screams, “For the fourth time, I said chicken, you deaf bastard!”

      From the August 6, 2001 Presidential briefing described as a historical document by Condee:  "Nevertheless, FBI information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in the  country consistent with preparations for hijackings and other types of attacks..."  So if you were to say it was strickly a historical document,,,,  But that is not what I want to talk about today, Today I want to talk about the gay marriage issue, and where it comes from.  You know, when Clinton was President, gay marriage was not an issue in the country, so what has brought it to the forefront of sociatal debate? I think it is the morally lapsed Bush administration.  First, on the campaign trail in 2000, he says he favors civil unions,,  Then, you have Dick Cheney' lesibian relatives,,  Finally, you have Mrs. Cheney being the author of "Sisters", a historical novel of lesbian activity on the western frontier,,,,  So, America has allowed this sort of sorid decadence into the oval office, and now we are paying a moral price for it as the Republicans might say.  Back when the President was getting heterosexual blow jobs the country thrived,, but now look at the mess we're in!  Now, like most of the country, I dont give a rats ass about gay marriage, but I am a bit tired of those that do making me feel like I should give a shit. Seriously, prior to the Bush adminstration, you never heard of gay marriage much, so why now? Could it be it's an election year and somebody needs a wedge issue? For example:  Recently the right wingers of the Tennesee Legislature decided it would be a good idea if we had a law that refused to recognize gay marriages from other states, even though no other state currently is clear on recognizing their own,,,, but what makes this bill particularly interesting is that:  TENNESSEE ALREADY DOESN'T RECOGNIZE GAY MARRIAGE!!!!! SO IF THIS PASSES, DO WE NOW DOUBLE SECRET DON'T RECOGNIZE GAY MARRIAGES????  Hell, Tennessee doesn't even recognize common law marriage from other states!  But passing bills for photo ops is a long held republican tradition. Recently Bush signed into law "Laci and Conner's Law" designed to protect unborn children from thier mothers attackers. Under this law, if a murder is committed against a woman under federal jurisdiction, and she is pregnant, then it can be a second count of murder for killing the unborn child. Now some would argue that this is the first step in restricting abortion rights, and some may legitimately see it that way (do you charge the extra murder if she is unaware she is pregnant, or is just late?.) I think it is a good law, in fact, it is such a good law that almost every state has had it for years, and it has been tort law for sometime in this country nationwide (a wrongful death on a pregnant woman can result in 2 wrongful death suits, Tennessee requires, like most states, that the fetus be viable.)  But even that misses the point, which is that this law signed by Bush would not have applied in the Peterson case in any event, as she was not killed under federal jurisdiction anyway. Actually, few murders are, most are state crimes and like Petersons case, end up in state court! But that has never stopped this "President" from a good photo op.

Lie to protect the economic interests of an incredibly small number of people. Reception of flattery. Dispersal of flattery. Abuse of good will afforbed by ten people who are trying to gather evidence without partisan bias. Backhanded dismissal of all criticsism. Denial of any responsibility in orchestrating what will almost certainly become the most tragic and bloody war of this generation.    Rinse and repeat."  Of course, I was not able to watch the testimony, so Mr. Pollack may have a few typos in there...

      Well it appears the Bush adminstration have settled on thier final 9/11 stratagies,,, 1) we did take the threat seriously, and 2) It's all Clinton's fault.   I guess with Bush the buck stops somewhere else (probably around the $200,000,000 mark..). One wonders if they feel responsible for anything, it seems that although they call on the american people to take responsibilty for thier lives, they refuse to take responsiblity for anything.   It occurs to me that Bush's first lie was when he said "I'm a uniter, not a devider." Perhaps what he meant was that 4th grade math was above his head!

      308,000 jobs created in March, a new record! Woohoo!!............. but, at the same time, unemployment ROSE a tenth of a point (also  to a new record, well, since the Hoover administration) so,, apparently for every job created last month, another job left this country to be outsourced else where. That's ok though, King George II thinks that outsourcing to other nations is good for the economy. As I said in an earlier post, Bush policies have created millions of jobs since he took office, it's just that they are all in China, that is why you haven't noticed them....

      i found the following while reading a book about snake handling christians in north east alabama. it seems to me to provide perspective and context for plenty of the current shit. It's too bad that Ronnie Raygun can't chime in. I know Ollie North is doing his best two-step, but he hopefully will implode or be taken away in the rapture soon. And isnt that a strange thought? If the rapture happens, will FOX pundits be allowed to go to heaven or will rupert murdock HOLD THEM TO THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS?!!  but alas, seriously... I really understood Nick Berg's father on a deeper level after this:   "The Philadelphia Daily News Friday, May 2, 1997 Section: EDITORIAL OPINION Page: 030 By Jack McKinney  In my own reporting from Central America, I don't think I ever came across a major atrocity that didn't bear the prints of School of the America's graduates, including the slaying of those six Jesuit priests in El Salvador.  I remember the case of John Sullivan, a free-lance journalist from New Jersey who was kidnapped by security forces the night he arrived in San Salvador. I became close to his family and I was outraged to learn a man from the U.S. State Department had told them their Johnny was ``probably up in the mountains with the guerrillas, gathering material for a book.'' (In other words, his kin were expected to believe the journalist had drawn on the vast array of local contacts that a man with limited command of Spanish could develop in his first two hours in a strange country!)  In fact, Sullivan was mistaken for a Belgian missionary priest who was thought to be aiding the guerrillas and he was subjected to torture techniques taught at the School of the Americas.  By the time his interrogators realized no man could endure such agony without imparting some information, the journalist was too disfigured to be set free. So they staked him out with a stick of dynamite tied to each ankle and each wrist, and jammed another stick of dynamite into his mouth, thinking they would blow away John Sullivan's identity forever.  With no assistance from the State Department, the family was reduced to pleading for information via paid ads in Salvadoran newspapers.  A troubled policeman finally disclosed where the body had been discarded, X-rays of an old football injury confirmed the identity, and at least Sullivan could be brought home to rest in the family plot."

      In today's news, I see the Bush commanded military has attacked an Iraqi wedding. Would this have happened if we had an ammendment defending marriage??  Also in today, a recent poll asked respondants if they saw Bush as a divider or a uniter. The results were split 50/50.

      Wed May 12, 2004 11:07 AM ET     MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican Air Force has released footage of what a UFO expert said were 11 invisible unidentified flying objects picked up by an infrared camera as they whizzed around a surveillance plane. A long-time believer in flying saucers, journalist Jaime Maussan told a news conference on Tuesday the objects were real and seemed "intelligent" after they at one point changed direction and surrounded the plane chasing them.  "They were invisible to the eye but they were there, there is no doubt about it. They had mass, they had energy and they were moving about," he said, after showing a 15-minute video he said the Defense Ministry gave him permission to publicize.  The ministry confirmed to Reuters it had provided the video, filmed by the Air Force on March 5 over the eastern coastal state of Campeche.  "We are not alone! This is so weird," one of the pilots can be heard yelling, after the plane's crew switched on an infrared camera to track the objects, first picked up by radar.  The film, recorded by a plane looking for drugs trafficking near the Gulf of Mexico, shows 11 objects as blobs of light that hover in formation or dart about, sometimes disappearing into cloud.  Mexico's most popular nightly news broadcast showed the video on Monday night.  Interviewed by Mausson on another section of the video, the pilots said they grew nervous when the objects, still invisible, turned back during a chase and surrounded the plane.  "There was a moment when ... the screens showed they were behind us, to the left and in front of us. It was at that point that I felt a bit tense," said Maj. Magdaleno Castanon.

      On the same day Rummy tours Abu Ghraib, the CIA is saying the ax-man in the Berg video is known terrorist, Abu Masub al-Zarqawi -- who is supposed to be dead. But even if he were still alive; Zarqawi had a prosthetic leg. the guy in the video doesn't seem to be teetering on a peg leg.   And, maybe it's the lighting, but Zarqawi's hands look pretty white for a desert-dwelling bomb-thrower -- as do everyone's hands.  And, why would the terrorists go to all the trouble of making a video, ostensibly to terrorize the US, and then hide their identity behind ski masks? Why would they even have ski masks? One would think finding a ski shop in the Middle East would be like trying to find a Burkka boutique in Miami. It seems to me that if this was indeed the dreaded terrorist al-Zaqawi, that it would be a much more successful recruiting/terrorist tool showing the perps in all their Middle Eastern glory.  Another interesting thing. Note the body shape and stance of the perps. These are some well-fed boys. Chunky. Beefy. Are these the bodies of squirrely iraqi insurgents? what about the way they are standing. they seem to have modelled their on-camera stance on what is called Parade Rest in our military.  Why is Berg wearing an American-issue orange prison jumpsuit?  Why is he totally still while the knife is coming down?  How come blood isn't spurting out of his jugular vein?  It has been said that the guy in the video doesn't so much look like Nick.  Here is a recent picture of Nick Berg:    Finally, we know Berg had been taken in by the FBI -- and that's really the last anyone had heard.

      Rush Limbaugh's morning update 5/11/04:  "Ladies and Gentlemen, let me ask you a question: Have you noticed, since these prisoners [pictures?] of torture and abuse and misery and whatever you want to say--since these pictures came out, have you noticed that there are fewer attacks against Americans by Iraqi insurgents? Have you noticed that the death toll and the injury count is [sic] severely down--drastically down--since these pictures were made public? Now, the question is this: Do we dare a draw a connection? Do we say that these pictures have so shocked the insurgents and the other members of the enemy in Iraq that they don't want to get anywhere near this prison--anywhere near these female American prison guards and so they have reduced their activity and instances of violence against us? Well, let's say it's true: can anyone get away with saying this? I mean, right now the mentality is: this is so horrible; this is bad: this is disgusting; this is mean: this the worse America has ever been. Can there be any good derived from the release of these pictures? Can anybody make this connection and survive? Who would do it? I don't think it can be done, folks. But' I'll try. I'll do it."  Nice try, of course the right wing won't hold you to these words.....

      American civilian contractor Nick Berg, of Philadelphia PA, was apparently executed in Iraq by a group claiming to be affiliated with Al Qaeda. He has been missing since April 9th. The video is being shown on the radical Islamic website Muntada al-Ansar and is reported to show top Al Qaeda lieutenant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi carrying out the beheading.    The video showed five men wearing headscarves and black ski masks, standing over a bound man in an orange jumpsuit who identified himself as an American from Philadelphia.   After reading a statement, the men were seen pulling the man to his side and cutting off his head with a large knife. They then held the head out before the camera.   The statement read, "For the mothers and wives of American soldiers, we tell you that we offered the U.S. administration to exchange this hostage with some of the detainees in Abu Ghraib and they refused. So we tell you that the dignity of the Muslim men and women in Abu Ghraib and others is not redeemed except by blood and souls. You will not receive anything from us but coffins after coffins ... slaughtered in this way."   After reading the statement, the masked men pushed Berg to the ground, held him down, and executed him, shouting "Allahu Akbar" over the man's screams. The action took nearly a full minute. The hooded figure used a knife of some sort that had been tucked in his belt, and made many passes with it before the beheading was complete. They then held his head up to the camera.   Berg was 26 years old. His decapitated body was found Saturday in Baghdad.    Where's the liberal outcry over this? There won't be any, they don't care about Americans getting killed, just terrorist getting nude and having underwear on their head.

      As a result of the scandal involving the Iraqi prison, several members of the unit involved, who apparently had nothing to do with the abuses there, will not be receiving commendations earned in the service of thier nation, including several that were to be presented the Bronze Star.  No word from Dick Chenney if they will not be receiving medals, or not be receiving ribbons for these commendations. Given his prior insistence on the distiction between the two, I would hope that someone in the mainstream media would find out for us....

      now i see why geo 43 said no to overseas duty. he knew, even then, that being in the guard could be dangerous to his career. if he had to go half way around the world and torture people and possibly butt raping female prisoners in general, the photos might damage his future as  oil-grubbing-asswipe-in-chief.  note to rick: rush looks like he's put away a few snickers bars, and had a few snickers while making millions of dollars off of right wingers, but seriously, a candy bar FULL OF NUTS fucks up your atkins diet for at least two or three days. get real.   the style of bullshit humor in your previous post reminds me of the old photos from the 40's and 50's of lynchings where white people would dress up in their sunday best and go look at the strange fruit .dangling from the trees...so are you going to frame this one hang it over your dining room table with pride so your kids grow up right?  I mean, hey, you and toby keith are young enough to enlist and go over to iraq, i know a 50 something woman who just left for bagdad yesterday. instead of smarmy fake ads and sucky songs to bilk money out of patriototic home folk...PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS. book your passage to the land of bush, inc. etc... Then maybe this shit will get funny...

      Keeping in mind the torture in as been perpetrated by intelligence services (both military and private) it is instructive to remember who is running our "Military Intelligence."  William G. "Jerry" Boykin, whose bizarre religious comments last year sparked a (brief) controversy -- is the deputy undersecretary of Defense for intelligence, the man charged with tracking down terrorist leaders and cracking down on insurgents in Iraq.  In other words, he's the guy holding the camera:     In his own words:  “George Bush was not elected by a majority of the voters in the United States,” Boykin told an Oregon congregation. “He was appointed by God.”  Here's another:  "Then enemy will only be defeated if we come against them in the name of Jesus." Adding that our enemy was, “a spiritual enemy ... called Satan.”   So, here's the manifestation of Bush's Christianity hard at work in Iraq. His Christianity is so offensive, it makes the worst Catholic mainstream bullshit, er, dogma that I am familiar with, look like Unitarian Nambipambisim.   If corporatism + militarism = fascism then,  corporatism + militarism + fundamentalist evangelicalism = ARMEGEDDON  (am i the only one noticing this?)

      Are we not supposed to be morally outraged by the photos of torture in Iraq? Aren't we supposed to be decreasing torture and terror by Americans in the Middle East?  Then why (fucking tell me WHY) did the Senate overwhelmingly approve John "Honduran Death Squad" Negroponte (95 to 3) to be the new ambassador to Iraq? on Thursday no less! We had seen the pictures. We knew the story and yet the Senate overwhelmingly votes for a man whose claim to fame is his use of private military contractors (mercenaries), to terrorize the people Honduras, lest they think they might desire a government by the people, for the people, and not American corporate interests.  as Mussolini said, "Fascism should rightly be called Corporatism as it is a merging of state and corporate power."  The only thing scarier than the merging of state and corporate power, is the merging of church and state and corporate power, which is indeed what we have now.  As an aside -- Nader is polling at 7 percent with Kerry at 43 and Bush at 45. He will throw this election proving once AGAIN the hippies' relevance in the political process.

      whitehouse.gov has a page from march 17, 2003 and it's title is "Iraq: Denial and Deception", now that stands as comedy all it's own, but in the speech the prez gave he says toward the end:   "Many Iraqis can hear me tonight in a translated radio broadcast, and I have a message for them. If we must begin a military campaign, it will be directed against the lawless men who rule your country and not against you. As our coalition takes away their power, we will deliver the food and medicine you need. We will tear down the apparatus of terror and we will help you to build a new Iraq that is prosperous and free. In a free Iraq, there will be no more wars of aggression against your neighbors, no more poison factories, no more executions of dissidents,  no more torture chambers and rape rooms. The tyrant will soon be gone. The day of your liberation is near.   And all Iraqi military and civilian personnel should listen carefully to this warning. In any conflict, your fate will depend on your action.  Do not destroy oil wells,  a source of wealth that belongs to the Iraqi people. Do not obey any command to use weapons of mass destruction against anyone, including the Iraqi people. War crimes will be prosecuted.  War criminals will be punished. And it will be no defense to say, "I was just following orders."     (note: bold type added for text skimmers.) (and yes, i know, already, i know, big fucking deal...)

      From April 13th edition:  "WASHINGTON, D.C.—Like most of the Bush cabinet, Attorney General John Ashcroft took commercial jets when he traveled. But on July 24, 2001, he changed that practice and began flying in chartered government jets. Asked by CBS News at the time about the change, the Justice Department cited a "threat assessment" by the FBI and said Ashcroft had been advised to travel only by private jet for the remainder of his term. "There was a threat assessment, and there are guidelines. He is acting under the guidelines," an FBI spokesman said. But as CBS went on to report, "Neither the FBI nor the Justice Department, however, would identify what the threat was, when it was detected, or who made it." A "senior official" at the CIA said he wasn't aware of specific threats against any cabinet member, and Ashcroft himself declared, "I don't do threat assessments myself, and I rely on those whose responsibility it is in the law enforcement community, particularly the FBI."  Wouldn't it be great if we all had gotten threat assessments???

      The right wing on John Kerry saying "fuck" in Rolling Stone magazine:  "I heard that [Kerry using the F-word] and I can tell you that an educated person who has had schooling, and certainly the senator has, should not have to demean himself and others by using that word under any circumstances." — Jerry Falwell, December 19, 2003  "It is shocking, because these are people who are trying to be the leader of the free world, president of the United States. There's a certain amount of dignity . . . that used to be associated with the office. And George Bush, to his credit, is attempting to return some of that. It really does not reflect well on the Democratic candidates that they're stooping to this kind of language." — Mona Charen, December 23, 2003  "I've known John Kerry for a long time and I'm very disappointed that he would use that kind of language. That's beneath John Kerry and I'm disappointed that he did it." — Andrew Card, White House Chief of Staff, December 8, 2003  "You've got your good friend John Kerry-Dukakis, using the F-word . . . Are you at all embarrassed at these candidates?" — Sean Hannity, December 8, 2003  The right wing on "Dick" Cheney saying "Fuck yourself" to Sen. Leahy on the floor of the United States Senate:   "I didn't hear them." -- Sen. Bill Frist  "I expressed myself rather forcefully, felt better after I had done it," -- V.P.

      Strategic Snark Reserves "Dangerously Low"; Increased Consumption Blamed  Experts report that the United States Strategic Snark Reserves have been severely depleted, and absent new discoveries of snark may run dry within three years.  "Liberal bloggers have been using snark at an exponentially expanding rate, but it's not a renewable resource" said Lawrence Peters, head researcher at the American Blog Studies Group, a liberal think tank.  "Once it's gone, it's gone."  Already the shortage has had an impact.  Liberal bloggers like Billmon and Josh Marshall have taken extended vacations in recent months to recover; others, like the Washington Monthly's Kevin Drum, have dramatically curtailed daily snark output.  Other bloggers have suffered more severely.  "I just couldn't take it anymore," blogger Hesiod probably would have said, had this reporter bothered to contact him or any of the other people mentioned in this story.  "It started out bad, even before the Bush Presidency began, and it just kept getting worse."  Hesiod's own blog, Counterspin, was shuttered recently when he experienced Total Snark Failure, known as TSF.  "It was awful.  I just woke up one day and... it wasn't there.  Just nothing."  Blogger Billmon knows what Hesiod is facing.  Billmon had an episode of TSF earlier this year.  "Luckily, it was only temporary.  But it hurt like hell to be shut down."  The long-term prospects for bloggers such as Hesiod are unclear.  Snark-related research has been severely curtailed by the Bush administration, and new snark supplies are nearly non-existant.  In the meantime, all Hesiod can do is hope.  "I mean, maybe new sources will be found.  Until then, I guess my blog has to stay closed."  Anatomy of a Crisis  Snark usage among liberal bloggers reached record levels even before the Bush administration took office.  "Dick Cheney conducted a nationwide search to find the most qualified Vice President for George W. Bush to run with," said one anonymous lefty blogger, currently hospitalized for Chronic Snark Fatigue.  "And after the whole search, he found Dick Cheney."  "You had people like Karen Hughes standing in front of TV cameras in Florida, demanding to 'count every vote', while at the exact same time Bush lawyers were going to court to stop it from happening." said blogger Atrios.  "I mean, what the hell are you supposed to do with that?  And in a state run by Bush's own brother?"  Hesiod agrees that the months surrounding the start of the Bush Presidency were the hardest.  "The man's name is Dick," he laughs weakly from his bed.  "I knew then I was going to have to pace myself, or I'd never get through it."  Hesiod and other bloggers accuse the Bush administration of deliberately exacerbating the crisis by intentionally inflating snark usage.  "The administration is constantly coming up with publicity campaigns designed solely to bleed snark," said another anonymous blogger.  "They'll introduce legislation with the most absurd titles imaginable, just to force snark usage to spike."  Atrios points to the "Healthy Forests Initiative" as one of the more egregious examples.  "There's no way you can tell me that wasn't named that just to try and take out a few of the weaker liberal bloggers.  They knew exactly what they were doing."  Asked whether such legislation is taking a toll on him, Atrios begrudgingly admitted "It does.  I try to pretend I myself have an infinite snark supply, but I won't lie -- that was a tough few weeks.  It followed soon after 'Clear Skies', and I think that for a lot of the smaller bloggers, it marked the beginning of the end."  While Atrios is among the lucky ones, for now, experts caution that the months before the next election could see the shuttering of many liberal blogs.  "There simply isn't enough snark to go around, and it's only going to get worse from here," said Peters.  "Some of these bloggers won't make it to the election.  Their heads will pop like grapes."  Alternative Energy Sources Explored  Liberal bloggers and blogs rely much more heavily on snark than the rest of the "blogosphere", say experts, and the answer to the current crisis might be found in exploring other, more common energy sources.  More rightward-leaning blogs have long ago converted to renewable energy sources; nearly all are currently self-sustaining.  Of particular interest to researchers is Being A Blowhard, a common and renewable source of power among right-leaning blogs.  "If we could convert the energy of one Glenn Reynolds or Mickey Kaus to snark, our problems would be solved," one researcher said.  "Obtuse Self Delusion is also promising.  The question is how to convert it into snark.  How do you get from an Andrew Sullivan to something that a Billmon or Hesiod can use?"  Among the most powerful renewable feul sources is Venom-Filled Hate.  "But that's nearly impossible to extract.  All we're getting out of our test subject is 'Arf.  Arf Arf,' and that's a long way from becoming a usable long-term power source."  Researchers warn that none of thier work will be available anytime soon.  "It may be that liberal bloggers may have to supplement their snark with other energy," says Peters.  "Blend in a bit of these right-wing feuls, as an emergency measure.  It won't run clean, and it'll stink like hell, but it may be the only way to get through the crisis."  No Relief in Sight  In the meantime, liberal bloggers cannot expect much relief.  While the Bush Presidency is expected to end in January, experts warn that snark will still be needed at record-breaking rates for the foreseeable future.  "I know it won't end in January," says Atrios.  "The Republican party will still be controlled by an exterminator, a guy who used to kill kittens for practice, and a guy named after a blue Muppet.  And there are rumors of a new Contract With America, something about buying all gay people DVD players if they just agree to have their foreheads branded with one of the Ten Commandments."  "We have to be strong," Billmon sighs.  "I don't know if we can do it or not, but we have to at least get through the election."  Hesoid, still bedridden from his own experiences, agrees.  "This is too important.  I gave it my all, but maybe there's someone out there with a little snark in reserve, who can take my place."  "But we can't just let the liberal blogosphere close down."

      Now that the cannonization of Ron Reagan is well underway, it would be rude of me to suggest that the treasury print a 6 trillion dollar bill with his face on it as  an eternal memorial to his time in office.... so I won't.  I am wondering if there is a connection between his death from altzimers and Bush jr,'s limiting of stem cell research in the treatment of this ailment,,,, do we have George the II to credit for the death of this american hero? What say ye on the right wing?

      In these historic times there are few things worth writing about. Politics for sure merits keystrokes. But i think we have been neglecting food.   Judge Bean's Texas BBQ in nashville (in Bill's neighborhood, no less)... oh my gawd! i know jane and michael stern (roadfood.com) love Dixie bbq in JC -- a well deserved distinction -- but this is incredible. If you go, get the BBQ Tacos.   Who knew Texas even had a style of bbq?

      ok, so yesterday, it was announced that Bush had hired a lawyer to represent him in the "who outed the CIA agent's identity" investigation,, and today, his director of the CIA resigns,,, and thus far I have heard no one in the media connect these dots....

      Does anybody remember the origin of "It was that a half a peanut butter sandwich that sent (him/me/whoever) over the edge?" I think it came from an incident at a Dead show, but it also entered my life at the exact same time as "leglessly hairlessly brainlessly" as a catchphrase, so maybe it's a Butthole Surfers thing.

      "White House Projects Highest Deficit Ever By ALAN FRAM  WASHINGTON (AP) - This year's federal deficit will soar to a record $445 billion, the White House projected Friday in a report provoking immediate election-season tussling over how well President Bush has handled the economy.   The administration's annual summertime budget update forecast shortfalls falling to $331 billion next year, then fading to $229 billion by 2009. For each year, the red ink was smaller than the White House envisioned six months ago.   The analysis was released the same day the Commerce Department said economic growth slowed this spring to an annual rate of 3 percent, well below the 3.8 percent spurt that many economists expected. The slowdown was caused by a spending cutback by consumers in the face of high gasoline costs, the department said.   Administration officials hailed the budget figures as a solid improvement over the deficits analysts forecast early this year,...."   UN-FUCKING-BELEIVEABLE!!! HOW IN THE BLUE WHOOPING FUCK DO YOU PUT A POSITIVE SPIN ON THAT???

      WASHINGTON (Reuters) — A campaign worker for President Bush said on Thursday American workers unhappy with low-quality jobs should find new ones — or pop a Prozac to make themselves feel better.   "Why don't they get new jobs if they're unhappy — or go on Prozac?" said Susan Sheybani, an assistant to Bush campaign spokesman Terry Holt.   The comment was apparently directed to a colleague who was transferring a phone call from a reporter asking about job quality, and who overheard the remark.

      dear abby,  my local record store, (geographically the closest- 45 miles due east of my home) has a vinyl with virgin shrink-wrap(recordhymen intact) of "lizards" for 11.99 american.  (i have located a copy on euro-ebay(zoeken: lizards, nederland) for 4,08 euro. compare to tom petty and heartbreakers hard promises 7,42 euro...)  can you tell me if this is considered a good buy/deal or not at the stage in the BNM arc? should i haggle with the shop owner?  (they also have slightly used copies of "revolver" for 40.00 and the white albumn for 88.00 american respectively.)  i also know of a particular recorded music shop in chicago (near the great white north) that has brother boy cd's and they are asking 13.99 american for those.  thanks for your advice, sincerely,  groovehopper

       rick, unwittingly, has found the catch-22 in modern investing. EVERYBODY's EVERYTHING -retirement, college funding, etc... has been pushed into the "free market" of the stock exchange.   man cannot prosper on bonds alone. well, not til greenspan gets nutty and raises prime lending rates to 13% anyway.  before Enron became the feature of a verb(who enroned your ass?), if you had stock in them texans, you invest there and your kid might be able to go to a real college. Hell, Philip Morris changed their name to Altria so people could invest in them with less guilt.  I wish I could pull a Thoreau and tell my broker to avoid certain stocks, but then my kids won't have very much for college in their IRS-protected funds. I dont know day-to-day which 500 companies they might buy or sell on my behalf at any rate.   (They might have to go to ETSU, though I'd prefer OTR truck driving school over that.)  the very idea of modern investing for retiring is for the employee to save a lil cash, avoid taxes, then to take a lil' 401K profit and re-invest it every quarter for 40 years or so.  Once the idea of retirement was a "pension", and the company you worked for had control of the up and down of that. it was plodding, but generally secure for folks who could stick around long enough to divest (work at Tennessee Eastman Co. for about 50 years without dying of cancer, for instance). But now, the folks left working for Eastman don't want their own stinky stock. they want diversity- not in life, but demand it only in their portfolio of course. of course...  to recap our top story, Dick Cheney is still a criminal who should be eating humus in Gitmo. (I'd hate to be the canine on a leash that had to try and scare him) Unless he could get asylumn in Tehran, where his real friends reside, of course.  the real problem with "hell-a-burden" is the shit that has been happening since the war in IRAQ started. you know, the no bid fuck the taxpayer guaranteed contracts and the war profiteering in the last few months.   so lets all put on our flak jackets and camo helmets and sing the war profiteers theme song:  "D-I-C- see you in hell real soon,  K-C-H-E-N-E-Y-  why,  well, go fuck yourself.  Boy, do I feel better,  B-U-S-H-i-t!"

      The 9/11 Commission that Bush opposed has released it's report, and with it specific recommendations for how future terrorist attacks could be prevented by making the Washington intelligence bureaucracy more efficient. President Bush and the Republican controlled House and Senate have responded to this call to protect our nation by going on vacation.

       Halliburton hypocrisy?     &nbsp;  : Teresa profited when VP was CEO   By David R. GuarinoRead Guarino's   urlLink  Road to Boston Blog   Wednesday, July 21, 2004     As Sen. John F. Kerry's campaign escalates charges over energy giant Halliburton's government deals and ties to Vice President   urlLink  Dick Cheney   , there's one thing they don't mention - the Kerry family's own Halliburton payday.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teresa Heinz Kerry liked the Cheney-run Halliburton enough to buy and sell more than a $250,000 in company stock in 1996, netting a tidy profit of up to $15,000, records show.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Kerry family Halliburton investment is tucked in the Massachusetts senator's lengthy financial disclosure forms, reviewed by the Herald.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The records, which limit disclosure only to broad ranges, show one of the Heinz family trusts bought between $250,001 and $500,000 of Halliburton stock on May 13, 1996 - while Cheney was its CEO.

      Bill knows- but six years ago DICK cheney knew too:  "BERNAMA, THE MALAYSIAN NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY  KUALA LUMPUR, April 20, 1998   Former United States Defence Secretary Dick Cheney today hit out at his government for imposing unilateral economic sanctions like the  Iran-Libya Sanctions  Act, saying they have been "ineffective, did not provide the desired results and a bad policy".   "I have made it clear that our (the US unilateral) sanctions policy is wrong," he said when asked to comment on the Iran-Libya Act which contains provisions for sanctions to be imposed by the US against foreign companies making investment beyond US$20 million a year in the oil and gas sector of the targeted countries.   Malaysia, which is against the extra-territorial law, has said that Petronas and other Malaysian companies will continue to invest abroad despite the US threat of sanctions under the Act.    Petronas is currently involved in a US$2 billion gas field project in Iran undertaken jointly with SA Total of France and Gazprom of Russia.    Speaking to reporters after calling on Datuk Seri Dr Mahathir Mohamad at the Prime Minister's office here, Cheney, who is now the chairman and CEO of Halliburton, said: "The US needs to be much more restraint then we have been in terms of pursuing unilateral economic sanctions."   Cheney, who served under the Bush administration between 1989 and 1993, however said the multilateral economic sanctions imposed by the international community on Iraq were "appropriate".    "I disagree with the current law (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act) but my company will comply with the rule (Act)," he said.    He said he also disagreed with the unilateral economic sanctions imposed on Myanmar and Arzerbaijan."   emphasis added  WAKE THE FUCK UP!

      Schwarzenegger is of the opinion that democrat legislators and union members are "girlie men."  Does that include the union members that kicked his daddies ass back in WWII?? Say, come to think of it, wasnt Ron Reagan a union president at one time? I guess while he was lifting weights to prove his manhood, guys like Kerry and McCain were getting shot at so that useless fucks like him could run down the American way of life. Hey Arnie! If you don't like it here why dont you move your ass back to the Rhineland and make all the german girlie men wear pink triangles while you ship them off to Auschwitz?

      "Behold the political alignment that Kansas is pioneering for us all. The state watches impotently as its culture, beamed in from the coasts, becomes coarser and more offensive by the year. Kansas aches for revenge. Kansas gloats when celebrities say stupid things; it cheers when movie stars go to jail. And when two female pop stars exchange a lascivious kiss on national TV, Kansas goes haywire. Kansas screams for the heads of the liberal elite. Kansas runs to the polling place. And Kansas cuts those pop stars' taxes." &nbsp; thomas frank

      According to Seymour Hersh (you know, the Pulitzer Prize winner investigative reporter who broke the My Lai story in 1970 and the Abu Ghraib prison abuse story earlier this year), that is not hyperbole. There is video of U.S. soldiers at Abu Ghraib sodomizing young Iraqi boys. Donald Rumsfeldd  urlLink alluded to it  during his testimony before the Armed Services Committee in May.   Hersh disclosed this during an ACLU speech last week.  urlLink Here's  video of the event. It's actually the whole event which is waycool because Sandra Tsing Loh is the first speaker. She is relating how she was fired from public radio for saying "FUCK" in one of her monologues. The "FUCK" was supposed to be bleeped out by the engineer, but he missed the edit. It was a pretty innocuous and contextual uttering of "FUCK" too, in a story having to do with Bette Midler. So the "FUCK" was actually a hommage.   Not the I-hope-you-die usage Dick Cheney intended on the Senate floor. During the "class" photo.   Watch the video of the speeches your damn self. Hersh's mention of Abu Ghraib is right around 1:30:00 -- that's one hour and a half into the stream.  Afterwards, Greg Proops performs.   urlLink the video

      What a busy week!  First the Edwards VP announcement (and Bush's facile reaction 'the difference is Cheney could be President' -- duh -- he already is). Then, a weird conservative push for the Bush campaign to drop Dick "Potty Mouth" Cheney.   Then the revelation that Bush's military records have been "destroyed."   Another revelation cites that 20 billion dollars of oil money is missing from Iraq (as Bremer dashes off in an Army helicopter).  Next, Bush's snub of the NAACP (who needs black votes when they are easily dropped from the voter rolls).  And just when the release of the Arms Services Committee report on going to war under false pretenses made this week seem like a William Burroughs political thriller, we are told that Tom Ridge, Director of Homeland Security is having legal memos drawn up that will enable the Bush administration to "postpone" the election without the consent of congress.   POSTPONE THE ELECTION.  This at the urging of  DeForest Soaries Jr., Bush appointed chairman of the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Soaries also happens to be the senior pastor of a 7,000-member First Baptist Church in New Jersey. Culture war is so five minutes ago. This season it's Holy War, baby!  Pour yourself a tall one and sit back and wait for the giant splatter of shit fanning out from sea to shining sea.   They know they are going to lose and lose BIG. And like Veruca Salt the greedy bastards have no self control. They must have all the blueberries. MMM, blueberries. In the immortal words of Dick Cheney, "go fuck yourselves," America -- we've got gorging to do. Haliburton, Bechtel, KBR and all the rest haven't sucked us completely dry yet. It's like Mr. Burns from the Simpsons is running the country.  As interesting as this is, my one question is what do YOU think? What on earth do you do any differently given that everything right and good about this country is being stolen from us right before our very eyes. They aren't even being coy about it. In the words of Lewis Black, "it's like they are sitting on our face and taking a dump."  Come on, ya'll -- even the most daffy Republican can't go along with this. This is treason. Coup-like, even.  What say ye?

      Ya know, it occurs to me that if Kerry's largest contributor had been indicted, the headlines would have mentioned Kerry's name, Yet in no story I have read thus far about the arrest of Kenneth Lay had George Bush's name been mentioned. So I will.  Kenneth Lay has been indicted by a Federal Grand Jury for essentially a form of theft (bilking folks that purchased his stock out of thier savings when he knew the stock was overvalued due to his own malfeasence.)  Alot of the money Lay is a  accused of making in this manner went to the Bush/Cheney coffers for the 2000 election as Lay was the biggest single contributer.  Neither Bush nor the Republican party have offered to return this money to the people it was stolen from.  Dick Cheney refuses to release the names of those who served on his energy task force; among those believed to serve is this now accused felon.  Ya know what they say,,, "birds of a feather...."

      Having failed to pass the Anti gay marriage amendment, and having not bothered with an anti abortion amendment (even thought they control both houses and the executive branch,,, strange they didn't try that) I suggest the republicans should now try to combine thier efforts and pass the Anti Gay Abortion Amendment. Under this proposal, gays could not seek an abortion, except in cases of rape or incest; Remember friends, gay abortion is a threat to traditional abortion in the country!

      "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."  -"President" Bush, 8/5/04  So as I read it, the Bush regime never stops thinking of ways to harm our county. Ya know, that sorta makes sense of the last 4 years...  Also in the recent days, a group of Bush supporters showed up at a rally that Teresa Heinz-Kerry was speaking at and began chanting "Four more years, four more years." The future first lady began a chant that drowned them out of "Three more months, three more months" I like that.

      Don't know how many of you have heard about the staged terrorist drill conducted during the Carter County Commission meeting last night. People were being held at gun point (one guy shot a cap gun "for effect"). Few people knew it was going to happen (including all of the important officials who should have known), and it was the most hilarious, disturbing thing to happen here since the dead cat nativity scene. It will be a miracle if the EMA director here doesn't get fired. There are no words to explain the event - someone needs to make an independent film is all I have to say.

      Bush Insists Economy Is on 'Rising Path' By DEB RIECHMANN  "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) - The federal deficit is at a record high and economic growth has slowed, but President Bush is insisting on the campaign trail that the U.S. economy is on a ``rising path.'' In his weekly radio address Saturday, which he taped Friday while on a stop in Michigan, Bush worked to convince voters that the economic rebound is not stalling."
