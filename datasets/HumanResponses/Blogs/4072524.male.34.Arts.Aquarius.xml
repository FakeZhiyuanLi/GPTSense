      So why am I doing this?  My close friend, Charlote, who dates back to my days as a student at U of Rochester, is a fine writer and expressed regret at the fact that she hadn't asked me to keep a blog about my experiences as an expectant father.  Charlotte, on her trip to Mysore, India, kept a blog called "Mysore Express," which was quite fascinating. Obviously, this will be a bit different, nonetheless, the play-by-play of life may prove to be interesting/educational/uplifting reading.  First, it's interesting to note that I did not remember the name of Chalotte's blog, "Mysore Express" until I looked it up for writing the last paragraph, yet I titled my blog "Riding on The Daddy Express" for lack of a better title and to get through the registration process on the site ASAP. I guess there are no true original idease, and the subconscious stores all the little facts that we believe to be forgotten for later use.  ------  Today is Friday, July 30th. Sang A's due date is August 8th. This week when we had our weekly appointment with Dr. Stromer, Sang was disappointed to learn that there was still no 'action' inside her. That translated means that the cervix, or bottom of the uterus has not started to widen, which would indicate labor is imminent.  I can't tell you how many times I heard people talk about the cervix dialating, but didn't know exactly what it was until Carmen Flores, a delivery room nurse from Lenox Hill hospital came to our home to give us a private, 3 hour class. During this period, we learned when to call the doctor, what the stages of labor are and what to expect, along with diagrams, time charts and discussion of what happens if you need a C-section, and topped off with a video of different women going through labor and giving birth. It's also important to note that sex can help bring on labor because of a protein in the semen that initiates contractions.  It was an epiphony to only be learning about the details of birth within weeks of needing it. It struck me that in our culture, the details of both birth and death are kept from us until we are thrust into either extreme.  At first when Sang A became pregant and her belly started to bulge a little, I was overcome with the feeling of taking part in a miracle. How could a new life that we created be growing inside of Sang's stomach? I felt humbled, like a pawn in nature's greater scheme and the words to Stevie Wonder's "Isn't She Lovely" keep going through my mind:  "Isn't it great what God has done? Through us He's given life to one"  I have to exit the expressway for now, but will return with more since now I'm warmed up, I can get all of the saved up thoughts off of my mind.

Here is the link to photos from the past two days:   urlLink http://share.shutterfly.com/osi.jsp?i=EeANGzJy0cOGTFbg   The days are flying by one after another. I can look at Olivia in the morning and see changes in her from the day before; her face filling out and her head growing, her hands and feet getting bigger and her body filling out. It is such a miracle ocurring right before our eyes.  Today we were one tired household. Sang and I were simply beat. Not that I can even compare what I'm going through to what she is going through; with all the changes in her body. Yet mentally, I suppose, this has been taxing on me too. I've never been one to go to bed early, and I get woken up on the early side, so I end up catching short naps throughout the day. Then I've got the creative writing/photography project, which I feel compelled to keep up with, so I usually end up staying up late (like right now).  So far, Olivia has been an exemplary newborn. She is easy-going, mostly crying when she needs something. Today she fussed a bit, but it was because she wanted to eat - and eat she did. At some points it felt like she was eating every hour. It's possible that tomorrow we might wake up and find a giant in her place!!!  We've been having visitors. Yesterday, Erica, my friend from my time at Jive Records came over and today Dan & Kerry Hart (he started Echo Networks, where I worked for a year), and this evening Sang's cousin Sang Meen came over. It feels like the next couple of weeks is going to be a sea of visitors. Not that I am complaining. We are excited for our friends and family to meet Olivia (and get their photo ops!), but it can be tiring  doing all that entertaining too.  This weekend we will be on our own with Olivia. Mel, our nurse is going to a reunion of her nursing school in Atlantic City. Sang and I are excited for this as we think we've got the hang of things now!  Sang just came into the kitchen and caught me eating Corn Pops and watching TV! Time to turn it in for the night.

        urlLink        urlLink &quot;Olivia&quot; &amp; The Fairies     Originally uploaded by  urlLink funkyjam .     Today we received a beautiful work of Original art created for Olivia by an English artist, whom Jay & Lisa saw on the cover of a magazine when they were on vacation there. They actually contacted her and commissioned this piece, which is Olivia's name, with beautiful fairies painted in and around the letters.   This will surely be one of those special pieces that Olivia will have and cherish for life. It will probably also be the way the she first learns to spell her name!  I remember one of my mother's friends made a needle point for my birth gift. It had a cat in a tall, upright position, with my name, birthdate, birth time and birth weight. It hung in my bathroon and I must have read it thousands of times up until I was 10 (then I discovered the newspaper!).   I already hung "Olivia and the Fairies" in a much more dignified place; in her room, over the blue velvet chair. When the lights are low and we sprinkle some sleepy dust in the air, the fairies can relax their poses and glide effortlessly in circles over Olivia's crib. May they inspire her thoughts and dreams and encourage her imagination.   Speaking of visitors, we've been keeping it low key. It's wonderful to share Olivia with all our friends and family, but it's also been important for Sang to catch up on her sleep and get back 'to normal.'  Breast feeding is encredibly energy draining and time consuming. Olivia feeds every 2-3 hours, and one feeding takes approximately 40 minutes. On top of Sang healing from the delivery, she has to make sure to get plenty of nourishment as Olivia's agent in all matters nourishing.    The bonding that takes place between a breast-feeding mother and child is nothing short of miraculous. Watching Olivia latched to Sang's bosson, sucking non-stop, dozing and waking, is heavenly. The instinct of the child and her ability to smell her mother and home in on the milk is a little scary.  I say this because as adults interacting in our world, instinct seems to be so much more buried benath all the layers external brandishings that we've acquired.   I suppose instinct is all about helping us, as individual creatures, to survive. When it's a baby, it's about finding nourishment and as we grow it's about protecting and feeding ourselves and our families. I also think that those who 'trust their gut' when making decisions are relying on instinct.   Is instinct by nature "basic?" or is basic instinct a newborn's instinct to suckle at his mother's bosom?  As a result of the feeding, Sang sometimes feels fluish and simply has to sleep it off. Luckily we have Mel, who has been through this many times over with the newborns she's taken care of. Having someone who has seen it all and is truly an expert, is a huge source of relief and encouragement. Now Sang has her mother, Mel and me making sure that she eats well.  I don't know if anyone watches the Daily Show with Jon Stewart - as an aside, he is a recent first-time father - but I am going to log off and end my day as I do most, with my TiVo'd episode of today's show. I think it's healthy to go to bed laughing.  Here's a link to today's photos.   urlLink http://share.shutterfly.com/osi.jsp?i=EeANGzJy0cOGTFKg

        urlLink        urlLink Nursing In Olivia's Room     Originally uploaded by  urlLink funkyjam .     Now there's a communication system that we're understanding better. Olivia cries when she needs a diaper change, to nurse, or a little attention. She's generally pretty mellow and doesn't launch into long bouts of crying. Surely it's early and anything can happen, but when it's your child, she's always perfect!  There's still a story to tell about her birth, by it's 3 am and I have to drive Yoomee to the airport tomorrow.   Although it would be great if she could stay longer, she has Sang Jun (her husband & sang A's brother to get back to). She's been with us for two weeks and it worked out great because Sang's mother doesn't speak much english and Yoomee does, so she could take care of things while Sang was in the hospital.  Yoomee is a very sweet sister-in-law. Very considerate and always cheerful. She likes to have a good time, and enjoys partaking in all the good food that NYC has to offer. I have to say that When the four of us are together, we always have a great time. Wheter we're eating, shopping, walking around the neighborhood or hanging around the house. Sang's Mom is more like a teenager than an adult in spirit. She's very easy going and loves to laugh. Her soul is very peaceful and she's so easy to be with considering the language barrier between us makes communication of complex ideas nearly impossible.  Tonight Yoomee, Homonee and I went to Home Depot in Brooklyn. It's much closer than the one in Secaucus, NJ - no more than 15 minutes from home. I ended up buying three flashlights; those emergency supply things that you know you should have, but never want to spend the money on because now I've got that strong instinct in me to protect my family.  This morning when Sang and I were sharing a moment with Olivia in the foyer, outside the kitchen, I aksed "Can you believe she's really ours? It feels like someone's going to walk in and say 'time's up' pretty soon." She agreed. I added, "It's so incredible when I think that she's with us for the long haul."  We both got massive grins and started to giggle like kids.  Adjusting to this fatherhood thing is quite strange. On one hand I'm still me, but on the other there's a 6-day old child in our home and she is half me and half Sang; and we are parents. I don't need drugs to get a hit from that!  I guess having a nurse brings this new role as parent in and out of focus because she can take Olivia when we're 'through'' with her. Then the background  comes back into focus and I can go about my day until I realize that I need to look in on Olivia or hold her and kiss her a thousand times gently on the top of her head, and she becomes the only thing that matters again.  Although I am still on my self-mandated paternity leave, life creeps in through the cracks. I don't feel comfortable just letting things go and pile up to do later, yet those moments I spend sitting with Olivia on my lap or watching her nurse with Sang are like zen meditation. It's just us and it's wonderful. The quietude of Olivia and the empty canvas that she is is so inspiring and so humbling all at the same time.  Sometimes I go into a time warp and imagine her as a teenager or young adult, but then I catch myself and realize that there are thousands upon thousands of small steps that will come first.  Shortly before Olivia was born, I asked my mother "do you think of me as a child or as an adult?" She responded that she still thinks of her children as children.   What I was hoping to accomplish was to ask her to start looking at us differently now that we are grown-up with children, because my ideal of that would be that she would respond as an adult does to another adult rather than as to a child.    Obviously, it's not as simple or clearly dysfunctional as that, but I wonder what it's going to be like if and when Olivia says the same thing to me?

Today's firsts for Olivia included getting a shampoo, spitting up, getting serenaded by Daddy's guitar and God knows what else.  I also want to add that I have changed several diapers now, and it really is one of life's simple pleasures. To take care of a newborn is a joy that I really never could have known until reaching this time in my life.  I hope I find time tomorrow to write about Olivia's delivery because it was a  phenominal experience.

      Hey, with digital photography you can always delete the bad ones...  I've tried to edit as best as I could, but it's hard for me to be objective.  This has been the most incredible 4 days of my life. I'll leave it at that for the time being.  You can follow these links and view the photos on Shutterfly for free. Heck, you can even order some if you'd like!

      Today we went for our scheduled sonogram at Lenox Hill. As usual, the wait was about one half hour. The sonogram operator pointed out the features she was measuring on screen and at the end reported that Olivia was 8 lbs 6 oz. You can imagine my proud surprise (Olivia was going to be a whopper) and Sang's shock! The doctor then came in and told us everything was fine, but he wanted to check the weight again because 3 weeks ago she was just 6 lbs 2 oz. He played with a few things on the screen and came back with 8 lbs.  He explained that it's just an estimated based on the size of the chest and abdomen and there's no absolute way to measure weight.  We also learned that the baby is in a very good birth position with her face toward Sang's spine. Hopefully this will add an element of east to the delivery.  I then picked my Korean family up with the car and we made a pit stop at Starbucks, anticipating that there would be a long wait, as usual at Dr. Stromer's office. Sang stayed in the waiting room and Homonee, Yoomee and I stayed in the car. Sang called when it was time to go in, and we got the usual welcome, "Sang, take off your bottoms, weigh yourself and and get on the table with the cover on." Sang was 147 and had gained 32 pounds.  I missed the first part of the conversation because I was on a cell phone call, but I came in for the news that Sang was going to be induced on Tuesday (the next day). He explained the process briefly and then reported that he could feel the baby's head and that Sang's cervix was 1 centimeter dialated (10 centimeters is birth width).   We then met Dr. Stromer in his office, where he explained induction in greater depth. First a softening gel is administered that thins out the cervix. This takes about 12 hours, so Sang will arrive at 9 am and be in a labor room all day. Dr. Stromer will see her in the afternoon. If this does what it's supposed to do, at around 9 pm a hormone will be administered that begins the labor process by getting the body to start contractions.   Dr. Stromer told us there are three outcomes. One, nothing happens - and that's only happened to three of his patients. Two, a slow labor ensues. Three, an explosive labor follows and the baby is delivered rather quickly.  With all the waiting that we are expecting to do, I opt for number 3!  As it stands, I'm planning on bringing the laptop and things to do while we are just waiting in the labor room for the meds to take effect. The most important thing is that Sang is as comfortable as possible.  I have to admit that induction takes away the surprise of labor and 'that moment' that all pregnant couples at least prepare for; the moment that you're going to have to grab everything and rush to the hospital. On the other hand, it alllows you to give family and friends the heads up. I spent a bit more time than I would have wanted on the phone this evening!  The alarm is set for 7 am tomorrow. We'll have a light breakfast at home and make our way uptown for our 9 am appointment. It's really happening and for the first time I am a little nervous. On wednesday Olivia will be in our world!  ------  Now, since the middle of Sang's pregnancy, Dr. Stromer and I have been joking about what we will get him as a present after Olivia is successfully delivered. This came about, when during Sang's hospitalizations (which I have yet to write about), I alluded to all the gift baskets that crowd his office every week, what the hell does he do with them, and what we might get him to thank him for his great care that he could actually use. He always said "wait til you have a healthy baby, then we can talk about it." As it turns out, at the end of subsequent visits, we would joke about what he was going to get when I took him to Best Buy." I said, "Do you have a TiVo yet?" he replied "one couple got me a TiVo for the first child and then a Sony Stereo after I delivered their second." A few weeks later I asked if he had an iPod. "What's that he asked?" I produced mine from my bag and he told me that his daughter was asking for one, but thought she was too young.  Anyway, today I learned that he's going to cash in all his gift cards to get a fflat screen TV on Friday! Wow, What great timing! Was he pressuring me???? As much as we want to thank him for his care and a job well done, I can't help but think he's got a system that works pretty well.    What I didn't mention before is that Dr. Stromer is an Orthodox Jew, and he knows my Unlces and father from synagogue. When he was a child/teenager, he sat in front of my Dad, Uncle Ephie and Uncle Morty at the Jewish Center on West 86th Street. Being that they are in their 80's and 90's (my father would have been 88 if he were alive today), they have built up quite a reputation in the NY Jewish community. At our first visit, Sang arrived before me, and when he heard her last name, he must have done a double take, and then asked if she was related to "The Propps". After making the association, he was very excited to meet me when I arrived 10 minutes later.  From then on, there was always talk of "The Propps.' Today as we talked about Best Buy gift cards, I learned that he had the notion that I am part of a NY real estate empire and that I should a) have better health insurance, and b) be able to help him achieve flat panel status.  As he's said all along, "First let's deliver a healthy baby, then we can talk about the present you'll get me."

      What more can I say? Lots, I suppose.  When for 8 months you are given a date that your baby will arrive, you start to take that date quite seriously. Unlike the "line in the sand" that GWB drew for Saddam, the due date is flexible and should only serve as a guide.   Having past the date now by one hour and three minutes, I can honestly say that I wish the due date was a line in the sand. It would be much easier knowing that there was going to be a result, instead of having to simply wait up to another week.  We planned around the due date. Yoomee came in from Korea one week before so she could spend a week after Olivia is born. Our baby nurse flew back from LA, where she was with her mother who just suffered a heart attack, and friends and family have been calling all day to find out "what's happening?"  I suppose the tone in my voice gives it away immediately. I do this intentionally, knowing why people are calling. If I sound calm, nothing has happened. If I sound excited then something must be happening.   As it turns out, there are people who are more nervous than we are. Jay, one of my closest friends in the world, gets nervous everytime he thinks about us. On Friday he called because he had a premonition 'it' was happening. My friend Louie has also called three times since Friday. Since I missed each of his calls, he assumed that Sang was giving birth and we got blessings many times over!  For us, as Tom Petty has told us in song, "The waiting is the hardest part."   Sang A lies waiting in expectation. Every twitch or achy feeling in her body might be 'IT,' Last night at about 4 am, when I was fast asleep, she thought she was getting her first contraction. All day we lay around waiting for 'IT' to happen. We slept, we ate, we watched TV, and finally after dinner we took a long walk along the Hudson River." It was almost like a our concession that 'IT' wasn't going to happen today.  So what happens next?  Tomorrow we have a standard day after the due date check up, complete with sonogram. Then we will visit Dr. Stromer and hear what he has to say. In the past, he's said that he will wait for a week until he takes 'next steps.'  In the meantime, every minute of 'extended play' is going to seem a little longer than usual. I know that, like I've been doing for the past several weeks, I must carry my cell phone at all times in case I get "THE CALL." I can't stray too far from home and I'll be taking extra special care of Sang who has to endure more aches and nausea than she expected or wanted to.

      I've been receiving phone calls checking to see if Olivia has arrived because I haven't written, as I planned to, every day.  This morning Sang A was feeling quite nauseous and, understandably, irritable. Today is Friday and Sunday is her due date, so she's feeling about as plump as a pocupine on Bubble Yum. We were in the kitchen, and Sang was reclining on the blue & silver diner booth, where she's taken to napping and receiving her daily foot massages lately. The discussion turned to the hamburger steak that Yoomee will be making for tonight's shabbat dinner, one of whose ingredients is bread crumbs.   Homonee, thinking that Yoomee needed only the crusts for her crumbs, made a huge plate of delicious sandwiches with the meat of the soft, Korean white bread we had bought from the bakery in Korea Town yesterday. Sang had a bag of the crusts and was munching on them, saying to me "my Mother was confused, Yoomee can't make baby crumbs with these."  She realized her slip immediately and we shared a wonderful, therapeutic laugh.  Yesiree... If it begins with a "B" and the due date is near, just say "Baby!"

      When Sang A first told me that she was pregnant, I couldn't believe it. Not because I didn't want her to be, but because our bodies were actually doing what they were supposed to be doing. It's hard to explain, but the possibility of being a part of the procreating human species was just very overwhelming for me in a way.   It was a late night, around 1 AM, Monday December 1st. I had just returned home from a meeting with  some producers for a project I was working on. I was sitting at my computer in the studio, which I do too much of,  when Sang came into to tell me the news. She was standing right next to the body form, which she uses to design clothing, wearing her comfortable at home clothes. Sang was clearly waiting for me all night to share the news and was upset that I arrived home so late. She handed me a litmus stick, said that she had already done the home pregnancy test and the result was positive. I accepted it from her outstretched hand, examined the pinkish/purple color, and looked at her saying, "Are you sure? Are these tests really that accurate?"   I suppose this was the very worst thing to say being that she was waiting several hours for me to share the news. In hindsight, I think she was 100% certain because over the past week she had been feeling not-quite-herself. Over Thanksgiving at my Mother's home, Sang spent a lot of time in bed and my brothers and their wives asked half in jest if Sang was pregnant? (it was just that Thursday that Dina had told us the great news that she and Doug were going to be having a baby) I also think that Sang A wanted a jubilant reaction. One where I would grab her and start dancing around the room, screaming joyously and breaking open the champagne. I don't remember exactly what followed, but she left the room disappointed (alerted by the slamming bedroom door) and I went back to work with new things to think about. I think my next action was to google 'home pregnancy tests,' where I read about their high accuracy.   I remember the next morning I was making some oatmeal and getting ready to head off to the gym, when Sang A came out of the room dressed and ready to leave for the day. She saw me eating and made the comment, "So that's how you take care of your pregnant wife?" She got me with that one, I felt guilty and poured some of mine in a bowl for her, but it was too late, my selfishness had added fuel to the fire and she wasn't ready to have an adult conversation about our potential new family member. The front door closed without even a "Goodbye."  The details of the rest of the day are vague, but I do recall the next morning, Wednesday, sitting at the dining room table, talking about getting conclusive results from the doctor. She was still upset and I was trying my best not to set her off again. I called Michael Frank, our cousin and GP, and he offered to do a blood test that very afternoon. While on the phone with him I also learned, once again, that HPT's are in fact very accurate and that if the test was positive, she was most likely pregnant.  Thursday, we received the call from Doctor Frank that Sang A was definitely pregnant. He congratulated us and we discussed keeping the news private from the rest of the family.  It was finally sinking in. I was going to be a father. Sang, a mother. And we were starting to build our family.  ---------  Today our former neighbor from West 67th Street, Peter Campbell, came over with some serious photographic equipment, a professional portrait photographer (Gerardo), and an assistant (Shaun). Over the next four hours, our living room was transformed into a studio and they shot some amazing and truly beautiful photos of Sang A and myself. Some single, some together. As soon as Peter sends them, I will post some here. This was such a kind and wonderful gift. We were both touched. Sang A's mother, who is with us for two months, was also having fun watching what was going on. I know that there will be at least one serious heirloom photo to come from this. Can't wait to see them! Thanks Peter!!!

      Click this link for photos:   urlLink http://www.flickr.com/photos/funkyjam/    I've just spent the past two hours configuring my blog with Flikr - a new photo website - so moving forward, it should be quite easy for me to incorporate pics with my blog. It seems that with blogger, we'll always have to link to another site to see the pix, so let's hope it works well for everyone.  I love to take photos and I share a relatively small number of them, so maybe now they'll be seen by more friends and family.  This afternoon we visited my grandparents in Chappaqua. Steven and Daniella (my Grandfather, Manfred's, daughter and son-in-law) came to visit. See Manfred is actually my Step-Grandfather, but I never know my real grandfather, so I think of him as my grandfather.  Anyway, Steven is an OBGYN who specializes in difficult pregnancies. Woman from all over the world travel to see him and get his advice.    When Sang was in her first trimester, she suffered from hype-emesis gravidarum (trans "hyper vomiting and nausea"). Unformatunately this all started at about the time we were leaving for Korea to spend "Chusok" (New Year's) with Sang's family.  To make a long story short, because it's now 3 am, Steven fielded many phone calls from me while in Korea and for the next couple of months. His confidence comforted us in knowing that Sang's condition was not harmful to the baby and provided an amazing second opinion.  The details I will go into later.  Enjoy the pix. As I commented on the laundry shot, I almost melted when I walked into Olivia's room this evening and saw the laundry lying flat on the bed to dry. It was amazingly cute and I realized how soon Olivia will be wearing them!  Before I finish: Last night we saw "Spiderman 2." Aside from being very entertaining, The loud noises from the film's special EFX coupled with the sharp blasts from the score's horns, seemed to thoroughly freak Olivia out. I had my hand on sang's stomach for a good portion of the movie and she was stretching from side to side. Obviously if we thought it was harming her, we would have left, but it was more of an amazing experience to know that our daughter's reflexes are in goood-working order and she is reacting to the stimuli in her (or invading her) environment!  When we got home, Sang was experiencing extreme heartburn or "ulcer pain" as she calls it. Turns out popcorn is really hard for her to digest. Anyway, she almost had me believing that she was going into labor. So much that I grabbed the handout Carmen gave us and reviewed the symptoms of labor and threw a few more things on the pile that will go into the bag that I bring to the hospital. One thing I haven't finished it the delivery room mix. Tomorrow....
