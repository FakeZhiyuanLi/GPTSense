       urlLink Kronberg/Ts.  , 8 AM... and what I am doing? Running, off course but sleeping might be better... Anyway, currently it's most of the time a real enjoyment to run pretty early in the morning. Sun rise is at around 6 AM and after my daily ride to work I am ready at 7 something to start, usually around 10 to 12 degrees Celsius (50 to 54 degrees Fahrenheit), no rain (when lucky) make it really a pleasure. You just have to beware of the dogs because at that time it seems that all dog owner have their first tour with their pets ;-( Only solution is to run as far as possible into the forest...  Run distance was about 16k (10mls) and took me about 1:20h, pretty flat course.

      A new house means (possibly) a new career, haha...  Anyway, after some weeks of non-competitive running (=jogging) I participated in the  Gießener Frühjahrsläufe  and clocked with a 1:22:50 for the half marathon, i.e. 4th rank in total, not to bad for such an old guy ;-) With execellent weather I really enjoyed it (possibly except the last 2k)...

          Heute war mal Vater-Sohn-Tag angedacht, d.h. ein richtiger Männertag so ganz ohne die beiden Frauen der Familie. Also, erst mal ab in den Supermarkt zum Verpflegung holen (Powerade, Fruchtzwerg, Sixpack und diverse andere, vornehmlich süße, Sachen) und danach nix wie in den Wald. Grund dafür: Der alljährliche 10-Meilenlauf durch den Licher Wald stand nämlich an und als gutes Vereinsmitglied fühlt man sich ja verpflichtet, zu helfen wo man nur kann ;-) Außerdem war das mal eine ganz schöne Abwechslung für das Möbelschleppen am Morgen und die Fahrt nach Darmstadt zur Imke-Hochzeit am Abend...  Auch mal ausruhen ist angesagt...

      7 AM today in the morning, the long(?) slow distance run was scheduled. That means, wake up, get into the car and drive as fast as possible to work and get out of the car and let's start. Starting in Kronberg (where I am working), running to the  Saalburg , taking a rest of one or two minutes and then getting back. In total I estimated that I have to run about 28k, so early in the morning could be not just fun. Additionally, I had to gain (and loose) some meters (see below).

      New race, new luck ;-) Actually the weekend was pretty exhausting as my wife and I drove to a wedding on Saturday morning and just returned back yesterday afternoon. Nevertheless, the  traditional run on Pentecost  must be attended for three reasons: 1. It's a local race just 20min by car 2. It's a race of the Rono Cup 3. MOST IMPORTANT: It's the fastest course in our area here  So, don't think about the heavy rain just think about race tactics. Which is quite easy for a 10k race: "Just go out there and RUN" ;-) The course itself has a turning point at km 5 with same way to and back. The first 5k have a moderate rise and, eventually, the last 5k have a moderate descent which seems to be perfect for running (as a lot of runners have set their PB here).  The Race started at 9:30 AM and was accompanied by slight but steady rain. After the first km the lead pack was nearly already away, strong runners participated (10 runners finished with a time less than 34min!), I clocked with a 3:15, much too fast, off course but beeing aggressive sometimes pays off. My further splits were 3:39, 3:41, 3:50, 3:46, i.e. 18:12 for the first 5k resulting in a 29sec improvement compared to last year, further on the splits were as follows: 3:14, 3:20, 3:24, 3:26, and a final 3:25 -> In total a 35:01 (meaning 58sec gained compared to 2003), actually I could have done below 35:00, but my finish is not as good as I liked to have it, lacking a bit of focus. I was right behind another runner for the last 4k, I could have overtaken him on the last 500m but I didn't. I am uncertain if it was due to lack of courage or some sort of "honesty" (not to overtake him because he had the lead for so long time)... I don't know... Anyway, I enjoyed it and I really love to run such short distances in a pretty fast way (compared to my Marathon jogging ;-)).   Stats:  Distance: 10k Overall: 14/350 Age-group: 3/45 Time: 35:01  Impressions... (C)2004 by the race organizer

      Just decided yesterday to start in a race quite nearby (just 20 minutes by car):  The Oberhessenlauf in Staufenberg . The two main distances they are offering are a 10k and a 30k race. Both of them starting in the small village and then just heading out to the deep forests here. Additionally, some "hills" need to be defeated. Actually, I have chosen the 10k race meaning to climb the first 4k, having a flat round in the forest of about 3k and then to rush to the "valley" finish line.       Some more pictures of the race -->      Time: 34:51 min Rank: 6th overall (out of 170)

      Sometime ago I read this in a book:  "The harder you are on yourself, the easier life is on you. Or, as they say in the Navy Seals, the more you sweat in peacetime, the less you bleed in war."  Actually, I thought about it when I ran some days ago the Gutenberg Marathon in Mainz/Germany. There is that one bridge which you have to cross twice and pretty late in the marathon. Last year I failed their but for this year I had some "hill training" nearby my work in the Taunus. Hill training in the way that the whole run consisted of a lot of ascending slopes especially also when the run was nearly finished (i.e. after 90-120 minutes). This really gave me a boost on race day when I was just right before the bridge at the deepest point of the whole course.

      Finally I did it again ;-) On Saturday it seemed that we cannot run but have to swim because it was steady, heavy rain but on Sunday morning it was ideal race weather: A bit cool and cloudy but no sun and no run. I appreciated it! Off course. Race was as hard as expected. Start time was 9.30 am, nearly 9.000 people waited to give their best. Everybody had to decide which distance he/she should manage: 1/2 marathon, 2/3 marathon, or the full marathon. I planned to take the full portion ;-) Actually, the race course is pretty flat (sometimes a bit "wavy") except for km 22 and km 28 when we have to cross the big river Rhine. Most of the course we could enjoy the support of a lot of people only some areas were "deserted". I felt pretty well for the first 30km, could always manage a 4:10/km (6:42/mile). To my surprise I managed the bridge without greater "damage" ;-) Last year, crossing the bridge was the end of an enjoying run. This time I was lucky. Only the last four kilometers I had to fight with quite heavy stitches in my side. That was no fun but just for 20 minutes or so, eventually to late for walking, haha... In the end I clocked with a 2:56:53 (officially, net time 2:56:45), PB (since longtime!) and ranked 66 (out of around 2.700 finishers).

      The race is getting closer. Training is over, actually I intended to have a short run today but it's still raining, so I just cancelled it, maybe I will have a short one tomorrow morning. It seems that we will have nearly perfect weather on Sunday, it's pretty cool now (less than 12 degrees Celsius) and possibly rain will stop. That would be great!

      Had another early morning run today. I covered about 14k (8.7 miles) in a time of 1:01:30h (4:24/km resp. 7:04/mile). Pace was a bit lower as I intend to start with on Sunday. Weather is really fine for running, today in the morning we had around 12 degrees Celsius. I hope for same conditions on marathon race day ;-) The last two years we had to fight with bright sunshine and up to 30 degrees Celsius, obviously tooooooooooooo hot. I am still struggeling with race tactics for Sunday. I'm worrying about being not fit enough to stay the course with a 4:16/km (6:50/mile) and finishing in less than 3 hours. Let's wait and see.

      I had to rush a bit today. I could not make it in the morning so I took the chance to extend my lunch w/o lunch break a bit and "enjoyed" a 10k jogging across the "acres". Actually, I don't like too much to rush when I am jogging but what to do. Additionally, lunch w/o lunch break runs mean that I am pretty hungry before the run and afterwards the canteen has usually closed ;-( Fortunately a super market is nearby and I bought 1 liter milk and 2 small yoghurts (in total 1,07 Euro, wow, actually I didn't have much more money in my pocket). This should be enough until family diner tonight. More to come.

      After the heavy rain yesterday I was lucky to have great weather today in the morning. I planned to have my last "long" distance run test for the next Sunday  urlLink Marathon in Mainz . I met Robbie, Axel, Udo, Charlotte, and Frank (fellows from our local running club "ASC Licher Wald") and we just started to run using bikeways and avoiding the forests as it was pretty dirty and muddy. After one hour my fellows except Robbie left me and returned (they had their long distance run already on Saturday). Robbie and myself just added one more hour to run, I felt really good, no problems at all, I could have run for one more hour but had to leave for home as my wife and children were waiting for lunch... In the end, we covered around 26k / 16mls in 2:14h. Not to bad but I am not too confident for the marathon next Sunday, actually, I had only three runs where I covered between 25k and 28k during the last 5 weeks. That's not too much. Usually, it shouldn't be a problem to get to the finish line but clocking a time less than 3:00h could be painful...

      Tuesday, 5:30 pm, it's again time for club training on the track. Puh, that's hard, but I swear it won't be as hard as last week! I was exhausted for at least three to four days due to our "little exercise". We were a pack of 6 (Udo, Silke, Frank, Ralf, Michael) and ran 5 to 8 intervalls each with distance of 1.000m, slow run breaks of about 800m. I tried to increase my pace in each subsequent intervall. That worked and I felt really better than last week.  My splits: 1 - 3:44 2 - 3:39 3 - 3:33 4 - 3:29 5 - 3:22  In the end my mate Ralf clocked his last 1.000m with a 3:04. Isn't that UNBELIEVABLE as we are just joggers ;-)  Besides, Luca-Henri (my 5-year-old son) joined me today. We ran 400m, then he watched one intervall run, then he "ran" another 400m and so on. He was pretty dilligent. Next Saturday will be a race nearby, maybe he is in the mood for the 800m kids run. He's still doubting as there might be no medals for the Kids run finishers ;-)

      Yesterday's workout seems to be one of the toughest I had in the last time, puh, it seems that I am not made for racing 400m rounds on the track... Anyway, I could not stay at home as my youngest one drives me crazy, so I had to prepare the Baby Jogger for a short run with her.      Stats:  Distance: 5k Time: 25:00

      I don't know why but I was again on the track doing speed work. Usually I am just having my 4 or 5 runs a week, pretty moderate and in the forest but currently I "enjoy" running fast. I met with my running fellows from the club at 5:30 pm, Udo, Silke, Michael, Frank, Martin, and Ralf joined for a speed session. We ran together for 600m in a 4min/km pace and the next 400m the pack splitted in the fast and pretty fast ones. Then we jogged for 600m. In the end we ran the 1000m between 3:25min and 4:00min and did it 8 times. 8 sounds not too much, but I can tell you ;-) and my body will tell me tomorrow ;-)   Stats:  Distance: approx. 13k Time: about 1 hour

      10 AM every Sunday my runner fellows from the ASC Licher Wald meet for their run. That's always fun despite that today only five could manage to join: Udo, Silke, Frank, Ralf, and myself. The weather provided best running conditions, a bit sunny, no rain, and not to warm yet. I liked it! Most of our Sunday runs are through the local forests here, sometimes we are also running on bicycle and country lanes. And off course some Sundays we meet at local races ;-)  See here some impressions from the local forests:                    Stats:  Distance: 24k Time: 2:00:00

      The first time since last year that I pulled myself together and headed out to the track in my running club's town  Lich . Last year I participated once in an official track race of 3.000 metres w/o having any track training before, wow, that didn't feel well. So, on June, 30th they have a 5.000 metre race nearby in Gießen and possibly I will register for it. See here a snapshot of the track, actually it's nicely located on the outskirts near the forest but it's just a cinder track and in a pretty bad shape. Nobody takes care of it, all attention is on the soccer field (as it is in whole Germany)! Anyway, bad conditions make us just stronger when it comes to race day, haha...                Stats:  - 2k Warm-up in 11:00 - 5k in race pace in 18:07 (400m splits in 1:24, 1:25, 1:26, 1:27, 1:26, 1:27, 1:29, 1:28, 1:28, 1:28, 1:28, 1:28, last 200m in 0:44) - 2k Cool-down in 11:00

      Yesterday more than 50.000 runners participated in the German JP Morgan Chase Corporate Challenge run (right beside my working place in Frankfurt), i.e. the biggest crowd for whole Europe. The fastest male runner clocked with a 16:09 for the 5.6k (meaning 2:53min per k / 4:38min per mile) and the fastest female clocked with a 18:58, I'd assume that the slower ones needed one hour or so ;-) But I am sure they had at least a more "corporate" experience. Unfortunately I couldn't take part in that event. Sabine had an appointment in the afternoon and I had to take care of the kids; maybe next year!

      Puh, it's getting hotter and hotter these days. I started at 7:15 AM and returned back at around 9 AM but it was already so hot, I think at least 25 degrees Celsius. And that's a lot for somebody with such a white skin ;-) Anyway, felt fine, met a lot of joggers and mountain bikers (and only one dog) in the forest. In Winter or when it's raining I feel always so alone (not really ;-)) when I'm running. Actually I prefer running alone but running always alone (at least during weekdays before work) is no fun. Maybe I can convince my colleague to join me for a short round next week! Unfortunately people often say they might be too slow to run with me BUT I can always run slower, there is only a limit in running faster (at a certain level) ;-)   Stats:  Distance: approx. 20k Time: 1:45

Besides, summer is getting nearer, today in the morning it was already pretty hot, nearly 20 degrees Celsius... Now waiting for the next race on Sunday, currently I really like the races, to have this adrenaline kick when standing at the starting line, and knowing that it's NOT a marathon distance ;-) So, just run as fast as possible.

      Morning run: 6 AM, come on wake up, get into the running "dress", and go to work 7 AM, parking the car nearby the company and start to "run"  "Run" because I really still feel the 10k race from Monday in my legs. They are aching a bit more than after my last marathon, unbelievable! It seems to me that regneration is more a question of how fast your race was compared to how long it was, off course it's a combination of both, but a 3:30/km for 10k seems "unhealthier" than a 4:12/km for 42.2k (at least for me). Anyway, at least I added my little company round to my runing log ;-)   Stats:  Distance: 7k Time: 36:00

      I didn't mention that when it happened but it might be worth to post ;-) Around three weeks ago I had to go with my son to a pedagogue, our child doctor said he should go for a knowledge test to see how "far" he is (by the way he is 5 1/2 years). So, we stepped in, I had a pretty long talk with her about his behaviour (socially and educationally), then she made a pretty hard and long test of nearly one hour, the results were fine and everything was good as I just wanted to stand up and leave with him. Suddenly she asked me "Excuse me, are you a runner?", I was pretty surprised, thought intensively why she asked it, I thought, maybe she recognized my well muscular legs, my thin arms, or most probably my emaciated face, or maybe she saw me in race where I ran so spectacular ;-) I replied "Yes, I am a sort of a runner, how come you are asking?"... "I saw your watch, it's a runner's watch, isn't it?!" --- My watch, I see, and actually, I have just a pretty cheap Casio with basic functions (no heart rate monitor or so), nothing special. I just use it for running... Off course, she was also a runner! In the end, it seems that I am runner, you are runner, and both we know it (sometimes w/o words)!

      Today I just extended "slightly" my lunch time. Usually it's no longer than 50 minutes, today I took off for 2 more hours. Actually it's no problem as we have so-called "Jahresarbeitszeit", i.e. the total working hours of the year should not be lower than what's written down in the contract, so I was happy that I had some motivation to go for the LLSD (Lunch Long Slow Distance run ;-)). I took the route which brings me in the mid of the Taunus to the  Saalburg  and back, i.e. approx. 28k with gaining/loosing approx. 500m on height. Finally I was running uphill much faster than running downhill, that's cool, isn't it? See also  urlLink here .    Stats:    Distance: 28k   Time: 2:17:30 (1:07:00 / 1:10:30)

      I had a pretty good run today in the morning. Just started at 9 AM and headed out of the village, first 20min is just along the Autobahn, I like that not feeling alone ;-) Afterwards I headed uphill to the forest, and about 1:20h later I accepted a higher pace and really ran to my home. I felt really good during that run, I didn't have that good feeling for more than 2 weeks, it was the first time since then that it wasn't such hot and humid. I am really NOT a heat runner, I read in a sports magazine that for hot weather your body has to work a certain percentage more compared to when it's cool, I don't remember that percentage but I think it was around 10-20%. Actually, personnally I feel that I loose about 80% of my power and energy when it's hot... Is that just a mental thing? ;-)     Stats:     Distance: 17k    Time: 1:25:30

      We did it! One runner and 2 soccer player were the fastest Duracell bunnies in the Night Run today... My colleagues from work Andi and Stephan joined our relay team. More than 20 teams started for our company, in total more than 400 relay teams participated in the run. It was really fun (with some little ambition). The weather was pretty nice compared to the past days: No rain and a bit sunny. The race started nearly the  Römer in Frankfurt  and was just an oval round crossing the river Main two times. In the end we had a really good time, lots of runners, big crowd, nice weather and successful run...   Stats:  3*5k in 0:58:51 with 0:17:20 (Oliver), 0:20:28 (Stephan), and 0:21:03 (Andi)      The Duracell "winners" ;-) from left: Stephan, Andi, and myself

      Today is the fourth day w/o running. That's the first time that I didn't run for such longtime (except when I was ill winter). Actually it started on Saturday, I was badly motivated for the race and couldn't motivate myself to give 100%, on Sunday running with my club mates was a run w/o fun (just from a pain perspective ;-)). So I decided on Modnay morning to take some days off from running and think about my next mid-term and long-term goals. At least I didn't run but I am still not clear about my goals ;-( Anyway, today in the evening I will participate in a 3*5km relay race. It's a pre-race of the  German Ironman  which is held in Frankfurt on Sunday. As the Ironman is sponsored by  Duracell  (which is a daughter company of  Gillette  which is also the mother company of  Braun  = my company, puh) all employees are invited to participate, off course race fee is paid and everyone gets a free Durcall race shirt, yippieh...  -->  Night Run

       urlLink      urlLink The Toaster  is a large picture, 5 meter wide and 4.5 meter high, totally made from slices of bread toasted in different lengths of time to reach the nuances between black and white, ochre and rust. It took several days of work and several friends and their toasters to prepare the 2.500 pieces of toast necessary to build the gigantic mosaic, which reproduce a photograph of a toaster.

      Sabine and Amelie joined the race for cheering and Luca-Henri and me intended to run, yeah, not only to run but to run pretty FAST ;-) Actually, I like that race in Eberstadt, it's a small one (less than 200 runners for 800m, 1200m, 5k, and 10k), well organized, and it's in the neighbourhood. What I really don't like is the 10k course, 4 1/2 round thorugh the city, and lots of edges and up and down. It doesn't matter how fast or slow you are starting, believe in me, at least the last round with its 2.2k are really bad for everybody ;-( Anyway, I don't talk about the 10k, the 800m were just more interesting:  Luca-Henri (344) just waiting in a pack of 9 for the start:     Let's go!!!!!!!!!!!     Sabine "helped" him to cross the finish line:      Stats:  Distance: 0.8k Time: 4:27  Besides, my result: Distance: 10k Time: 0:36:49 Ranking: 7/111
