      As a child, I would pray. Not always, but sometimes. I had only one prayer that I had read somewhere and thought was rather neat and all that. "Please God bless everyone and help me to be good". (the bless 'everyone' included me ofcourse...and i wasn't really asking for anything specific for myself either!).  It's been a while since I gave up making that petition, but I was thinking about it today. And I was thinking about how I want some poeple to be 'blessed' a lil more than some others now.  I wonder if this is what growing up is about...

      A lasting mint is a thing of beauty. It's like an air conditioned breeze following you around in May.  Needless to say, I like mints !

      I once wrote a letter to myself (not that this is any different !). On my 18th birthday. To a 25year old me. I don't remember too much of what I wrote, but I remember that I had set goals that now seem very....lofty... for myself. Its funny how we take success for granted. Dangerous.

      Sultan is my dog. We met when I was thirteen and he has promised to keep me forever. He likes mithai, chicken, the new sofa and his 'chadar' (a rug that he carries with him all the time). Also, he likes my mother, my sister, my cousin Mona and me. I don't think he likes anyone else. He barks at the rain and entirely dissaproves of sleeping downstairs. He is of the opinion that sleeping must be done upstairs and that is all there to it.  This is what Ogden wrote about him :  "The truth I do not stretch or shove When I state that the dog is full of love. I've also found, by actual test, A wet dog is the lovingest."

      I am going to get a t-shirt that says "I Love Ogden" Ogden Nash has taken my fancy quite completely .  His Reflection on a Wicked World : "Purity Is obscurity"  And his views on the news:  Everybody tells me Everything  "I find it very difficult to enthuse   Over the current news   Just when you think that at least the outlook is so black that it can grow no blacker, it worsens,   And that is why I do not like the news,because there has never been an era when   so many things were going so right for so many of the wrong persons."    I don't think poetry can be more unassuming, simple and solid.
