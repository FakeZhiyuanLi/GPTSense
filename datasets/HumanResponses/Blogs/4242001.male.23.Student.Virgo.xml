      Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws.  Their origin is pure vanity.  Their result is absolutely nil.  They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak.  That is all that can be said for them.  They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account.      -Oscar Wilde

      I recently recieved a comment about a United Way charity that was spending money in exravagant, irresponsible ways.  It must be noted that each United Way branch is independently run, and is connected to other United Way offices in name only.  However, the persons comments about understanding the charity before one donates is well taken, and good advice.  My local office, in Greater Victoria is well known for its integral part in community development.  Without it, many local charities would be unable to survive.  Check out this list of local charities that we support : urlLink Who We Support   After meeting the people, I am confident that they are wise with the money they raise.  However, I must also note that I find it interesting that our society expects the people who do work for society such as United Way are expected to live meager lives, on the lower end of the class spectrum, but our society is ok with paying people such as athletes and musicians excessive amounts of money for their services.  The way I see it, the people, such as those working at United Way in greater Victoria deserve a lot more credit than is given to them.  It must also be noted that if my income is any indicator, the people I work with are not exactly bringing in the big bucks here.  Ciao.

      You may think this is harsh.  You may think this is incorrect.  IT may be.  However, I thought i would just throw it out there, into the world wide web, and see what happens.  I was thinking about how to escape from having a really low self esteem.  Now, while there may be multiple reasons why someone doesn't feel good about themselves, I think that one of the falsehoods that is commonly preached is that to escape a low self esteem, you just need to be prouder of yourself, and not give a damn what others think.  I would like to prescribe a completely opposite remedy.  I think that a god way to get out of the cycle of low selfe esteem is to get off of your high horse and start loving the people around you for once instead of yourself.  Gasp, shock, woah.  Yep, thats right.  I read once that the ultimate in self worship is despair.  Think about it.  Someone who has a low self esteem, often is FULL OF PRIDE! Thats why they have such a hard time in life.  They are constantly worried about what others are thinking.  They are so focussed on their own needs that they have forgotten that there are many more important things in life than their own needs.  Got a low self esteem?  want to feel better about yourself?  Then take my advice...forget about yourself for one second, and love someone in your life.  Serve someone.  Give to someone.  You will be amazed at how a servants heart can make you feel like pure gold. And it's funny, when you serve people, they tend to like you and want to serve you back.  That leads to relationships, intimacy, and ultimately a better view of yourself.  Ok, enough babbling for one day.  Cheers.

      My new job with United Way starts next week.  I had a meeting with my boss about what the job will entail, and it is pretty interesting.  The scary thing is that for the first time I will be given responsibility and respect in the workplace.  It is a little intimidating.  I mean, at least at my other jobs, I could screw up and it didn't matter all that much.  Now I actually have responsibility for other people.  Woah.

      My life is a blank page.  I look at what I have done...meaningless.  I look at what I want to do...meaningless.  When will the pages of my life begin to fill?

       Welcome!  This is the first entry in my online exhibition of my inner thoughts, hopes, dreams, bitches, and whatever else I feel like doing.  Stay tuned to delve into the twisited mind of a confused, wandering, hope filled poet.  Well, maybe not a poet in words, but in spirit anyway.  Listening to Bryan Adams right now.  Makes me feel alive.
