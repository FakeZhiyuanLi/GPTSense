      During this summer I joined the summer program called BLAST. It lasted only a month but while being there our teachers made us really think about going to college and what college is. We’ve been asking ourselves questions about education, future and importance of going to school after graduating from high school. The teachers helped us to explore more and more questions from the original one and tried to give us all the possibilities to find answers to those questions that we wanted to know. When I came to the university for the first time during this program I had no idea what classes we will have, I didn’t know about the fieldtrips. All I knew was Shobha, the coordinator of the BLAST program. But as I got into it, it turned out to be very interesting and fun. We’ve been divided into three groups: A, B, and C. We had interesting and enriching classes, and the teachers are the ones that made them such. We also had free delicious lunch every day. But it’s not all about fun and nice food. We had to brainstorm ourselves, we had to work, think and write up our thoughts. English and Poetry classes helped us to reflect and show our feelings the way they are. George and David encouraged us not to be afraid of whether it’s wrong or right - the main thing is to be honest. I guess that is the key to write a good essay or poem. Even from the first day we started talking about college and inquiry. I’ve never heard of the word “inquiry” before till I got into this program. It means questioning yourself, investigation. We talked about going to college and getting our education. I’ve been dreaming to go to school since I was little. My family, friends, teachers encouraged me to do it because it’s very important in one’s life. Not so many people get to go to college, and those who do are very lucky ones, and they are the ones that get good jobs and are successful in life. But regardless my dream there is a couple of issues. I’m not sure what I want to do in my future. I have lots of interests but I don’t know which one is the best for me and my future. It’s really hard to choose the only one among all the options. I like to do science and everything related to it. I like experiments, I like watching chemical and physical reactions. I enjoy exploring more and knowing more about technology, earth, life. Each time I see something different the questions jump into my mind: Why is that so? What is it? The other thing I’m interested in is law. I am the kind of person that likes to argue and likes to prove my own opinion. The third thing is that I like to travel and it would be much easier for me to do it if I’d know more languages that I do which would help me to accomplish my dreams. But again by the time I’m going to reach my goals about college there will be so many questions following my thoughts. They are concerns about what college can guarantee in my future. Am I going to find a job after I graduate from college? Will it be the job that I want to have? I’m trying to answer those questions starting with now, and I guess they are going to be with me till I decide what I really want to be in my future. The other concern is economic one. I want to get scholarships or financial aid that would help me to pay my tuition. During English class I made some research on hppt://www.college-scholarships.com/, urlLink http://www.collegeveiw.com/  and hppt://www.collegescholarships.com/ and these web sites gave me some very useful information. College is for me. I see college as a success. Also, we talked about success in English class. I know that each person sees success in different ways. We talked about different words that associate with college, and George asked us to take some pictures of things that we see as a success. So during the fieldtrip in the zoo I decided to take pictures and I found it pretty difficult. But after a while I understood that it is not a big deal. I looked around and saw sooo many things to take pictures of that I got excited and confused at the same time. Because lots of them represented success for me. The best one was a fountain with a little boy in the middle and the water running through. The half of the background of the picture is full of high buildings reaching to the sky; the other half is filled with green beautiful trees that make the world look better. The little boy caught the fish that was as big as he was. I have a feeling of pride for him: he is surrouned by high buildings that have already reached highness of the sky and he’s a tiny person, who feels proud of himself for catching a fish. I guess that’s how I would like to feel after I guarantee from college: proud of myself at the first time and trying to do better next time.     By Khrystyna Levytska Clemente High School

      When the wind is blowing through the trees   The leaves are whispering to me     About my home town,       The place I’ve grown up in.          The wind takes my soul on its wings       And takes me everywhere     High in the sky making me fly as a bird   Letting me taste the fresh air and Smell pure water form the lake.  It takes me through clear, invisible clouds   And I can see the bus stops,     That are calling me to explore more,       Over the tiny, lovely homes,         That look like mushrooms           From the sky.      But at the other moment   I wake up and realize It was a dream.    By Khrystyna Levytska Clemente High School Group A

       Taking pictures that represent SUCCESS.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I discovered this activity very interesting 'cause it made me really think about what is the representation of success in my life.&nbsp; I took pictures of high building in the sky discribing my desire to reach something magnificant and great in my future; of flovers meaning making the world and my community look better and&nbsp;proud; water representing the purity; and the bird flying&nbsp; in the sky showing the freedom of choices and thoughts.  &nbsp;   Fieldtrips .  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that each of the fieldtrips helps us know the world better and know the students better too.&nbsp; We get to know more things about nature AND have fun.  &nbsp;   Science class.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In science we made hydrometer and measured the density of the water sugar solution with different per cent of sugar.  &nbsp;   Poetry and English class.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Actually we've been having fun from the beginning of the program.&nbsp; We talk about college and going to college, we are preparing ourselves to write a big and important paper&nbsp;about school.&nbsp; Also, we make poems and read them to the class.&nbsp;

      Success for me is really very important.  I dream of being educated, having a good job and creating something new.  I dream of being proud and making other people to be proud of my achivments.  I am very scared of failure and I don't want to fall in the eyes of my family and friends.  And I am prepared to do anything to reach my goals.

Right now I'm working, but I still have time to rest, and spend some time with my new friends that I met in college.  Recently, I moved into a new house.  It's very nice AND it's really big.  The only "disadvantage" is that the furniture still smells like new, but it's Okay.  I hope I'll visit you this year.  Bye.  Love, Khrysyna.
