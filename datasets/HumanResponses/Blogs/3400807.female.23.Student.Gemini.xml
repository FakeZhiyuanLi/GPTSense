      I'm starting this blog as a way for me to get back to talking to God. Even though these are   MY   prayers to God, I do realize this is a public medium. I've no intention of publicizing details of other people's lives, so... initials will suffice for identifying people for myself to look back at later and, certainly, God knows of whom I'm speaking. :) I guess that's about it. From here on out, the format will be a bit different.

      These will be a listing of the scriptural passages, most likely copied directly from the  urlLink online NIV Bible  (also listed on my  urlLink sources page ). I find that it's much easier for me to have a direct reference that includes all the passages I'm using to teach, rather than referring to several separate passages.

      This will primarily be for children's songs, although, should a particular adult song catch my ear and make me think, I'll most likely include it here.

      This page is sort of a catch all for various activities that can be applicable to any, or many, different lessons. I'll try to keep these categorized by no preparation necessary (for transition times you weren't expecting) and those that need some minimal preparation.

      I'm not so good at doing devotions, so, most likely, the items here are going to be from sources I have yet to find or define.

      I suppose an introduction to me would be a good plan, right? Right.  

[insert long, involved story] I'll be getting back to this later, folks, right now, I'm designing. :)

      Everyone has sources. Mine, for the following items, are:  

1)  Bible verses:  I use the NIV translation ( urlLink huh?? ), almost exclusively. I like to utilize the online source  urlLink Bible Gateway , which, for anyone interested, has masses of different translations available. For the lessons, I should be linking to the sections the story references.  

2)  Curriculum and classes:   urlLink my church  has a program called  urlLink Sonday's Kids  for Sunday morning classes. The kids are placed in classes based on age from toddlers up through grade school. (There are separate groups  urlLink for junior and senior high .) The class I teach is for three year olds, and we're provided with a standard curriculum on a two-year rotation (which means that two years from now, I'll be doing the same lesson again). Each of my lessons has already been selected for me   (praise God!)   in terms of what passages I'll be teaching on. The rest of the class time is left up to the individual teacher. South Hills uses  urlLink Gospel Light  for the curriculum.  

3)  Inspiration:  everyone and everything around me! I get ideas from my Bible, prayer time, my husband, my relatives, my friends, nature, books from Christian bookstores, children I see in restaurants, and most definitely from other teachers!  

4)  Pictures:  Storage is courtesy of the wonderful  urlLink Photo Bucket , and picture sources are my digital camera, the web via  urlLink Google image searches , and... well, I think that's about it for pictures. :)  

5)  Anything else:  As I go along, I'll list whatever sources I've used for particular areas. :)   

If you're wondering about where I find anything I haven't mentioned, just  urlLink e-mail me  at havechosen at webmail dot diaryland dot com. (Sorry for not putting the exact e-mail directly on here, but I've got quite enough spam as it is, thank you!)

      So, I'm sure you're wondering what this is all about, right? The reasons I've set up this page are:  

1)   Kids crack me up and I can't tell you how many stories I've got from my group of pre-schoolers that I think will make other people laugh or think.  

2)   I am not the most creative genius in the world, but, occasionally, I do manage to come up with good activities to help the kids get the story.  

3)   I can appeal to anyone reading this site for ideas when I run out of my own. (Not to mention that my best friend came up with the idea!)  

4)   I figure, if I have trouble thinking of fun, active, creative things to do, there have to be other people out there working with small children, trying to teach Bible stories, who have trouble as well. :)  

5)   Most of all, I'm doing this because I love God, and I think that this will be a great way to help teach little ones about Him.

               This is not the  ticket. This is not what I needed.&nbsp;This is not the way I wanted to see  Felicity: stuck in a bus with a bunch of girl-next-door and boy-next-door  American's whose rude obnoxious feelings bubble at the surface, reinforcing the  stereotype of rude obnoxious American.     I say please and thank  you,&nbsp;I follow the tourist guide, I put tokens in&nbsp;the oxygen boxes at  the memorials. I..I don't want to be here. The first vacation I'm taking alone  in 6 years. The opportunity of a lifetime. But. It's. not. There is no  opportunity. It's preplanned, prepackaged, sanitized, homogenized. It's empty  and meaningless and I'm surrounded by the kind of people I was trying to leave  behind.        The tourist  trade hasn't opened up on Felicity yet. The immigrant logs are&nbsp;closed  and&nbsp;prospective visitors are still going through background screenings  prior to&nbsp;receiving a visa. The only transportation to the planet are  military ships. Our days are planned and measured, recorded and examined. I had  not met a Felicitarian that didn't work for Travelers Aid until I snuck&nbsp;out  of the hostel and bought a ticket for the Rail.         Felicitarians...is that even what these&nbsp;people  call themselves when they are at  home?&nbsp;

      Preserved. As if somehow, the iciness can keep me safe. Keep me from hurting. As if the rain might somehow wash it all away. I signed up for this trip to run away from it all, really. And I see the people who do nothing but remind me painfully of everything I’m trying to leave behind. Ten days... and so much of that time spent in a seat just like this with nothing to do, really, but think about it. To think about how beautiful it was... and how very much it hurts, now, that it’s been lost.  Ten days... Ten days to see all the things we always wanted to see. The funny thing is, when I chose this tour, I never even thought about it. It was just somewhere, far away from San Francisco, far away from all the memories, and instead, every time I turn around, I’m confronted by those memories. All the things I want to share, to point out. Oh! Look! The way it blurs as we go along, it reminds me of that roller-coaster. And I want to giggle with you over the absurd antics of that small child. But you’re not here! And you won’t be, not ever again…

      I have 10 days here. Most of 3 of them I will spend on a train just like this one, moving from one place to the next. The other people on this train don't speak my language. They aren't unfriendly. They smile and laugh with each other, to each other, in their small groups. Children. Grandmothers. Business people. Students. Tourists, like me.   The trains here are so clean. People take their trash home with them. They teach their children not to spit candy on the floor. It's not hard to relax on these trains. Looking out the windows at the countryside and then city, passing once more into countryside. The wheels are smooth and fast on the tracks. The conductor announces a stop but it dosn't intrude and I think, is it because he speaks softly or because I don't know what he is saying. The air conditioning keeps us all comfortable, chilled, refrigerated, preserved. Even in the rain.

      Felicity, from the Latin felicitas.  Bliss. Great joy.  Good fortune. These, too, I have long since left behind me.  Dr Johnson said - forgive my slightly morbid fascination for the archaic - that we must make or find our own felicity.  Perhaps that was where it all went wrong, in that unspoken expectation that someone - you, actually - would provide it, ready-wrapped for me.  But you could barely keep your own from slipping from your grasp, could you, as you slipped from mine?  I have spent so much of my life trying to hold on to things that turn out to be as insubstantial as the water droplets that bead the window panes.  I can half imagine all those abstracts - love, power, wealth, hope, luck - pooling on my palm like mercury, dripping between my desperate fingers leaving only silver swirls and lunacy in their wake.  Maybe it's lunacy that has brought me here, now.  On this train to nowhere, or at least nowhere any sane and civilised person would choose to go.  I press my palms to the misted windows.  They leave an imprint of clarity that very soon clouds over again.  What am I doing here, I ask myself.

       I've been waiting to write here
 until I had the time to get everything properly organized... you know,
 the cast list, the all-about-me page, the cool links set up... but, I
 just want to write. So, all of that can wait. I'll explain as I go
 along for now and get to the details later. 

 In Sunday school with the three-year olds, we were talking about Palm Sunday. 
 
 Me:  And the people of Jerusalem were   so  
 excited that Jesus was coming to their city that they put their clothes
 down on the road so he wouldn't get muddy. And they waved--

 Danielle:  Teacher... *tugs on my pant leg* 

 Me:  Yes?

 Danielle:  Teacher...  *with a look of horrified fascination on her face*  Does that mean they were   NAKED??  

 Me:   *stifling laughter*  No, Danielle. It was only their   extra   clothes, like their coats.

 Danielle:  Oh, and like their sweatshirts?

 Me:  Yeah, like that.
  Seriously,
 what else can you say to that? It was a pefectly logical question...
 and next time, I'll make sure to say they put their    coats    down, not their clothes!

      So... I'm going to participate in  urlLink NaNoWriMo  this year. This, quite frankly, scares the pants off me. 50,000 words in 30 days? What the hell am I thinking? That's   at least   1,600 words per day! I'd actually have to do pretty much 1,700 per day in order to complete it.  (I think it's somewhere around 1,650. I divided it all out, but I've forgotten precisely how much it was...)  Now, granted, I type around 100 words per minute, so, if I were just typing things, well... that would only take me 16 or 17 minutes.  *thinks*  Ok, so maybe that's not so scary. Even though I won't just be typing straight through and will end up stopping to think, etc. I can spend at least an hour each day on it, which should  (theoretically)  have me up to speed without a problem. Ok, but still... do you know how long it's been since I've written a story? I mean, a real story? Not just the bits and fragments that come to mind occasionally? I was still in high school  (I know, I know, I make that sound like it was  ages  ago... but seriously, so much has changed in the last 5 years I have a hard time understanding that girl...)  the last time I seriously worked on any story. And, to 'fess up... I've never finished one. Not a real story, I mean. I've done little bits of stories or even some vignettes  (I'm relatively sure I mispelled that but I'm being too lazy to go look it up...) , and of course, all my blogging, but... that's really   NOT   the same. It's scary. And exciting. And... I've now declared myself far, far in advance of the whole thing, which means that I can't back out now. Well, that and the promise I made to  urlLink Ilsa  that I wouldn't back out. Seriously, I can't. I mean, she's working full time at a hell job, going to school and taking 8 credits  (or is it 9? I can't remember?)  and agreed to give NaNo a go with me this year! I've known about it for the last two years and been too chicken to try. So this year... I'm making the committment in advance. I can start outlining some sort of vague plot right now and getting prepared for it. The only thing I'm worried about is that... well, I have the tendency to start writing instead of just plotting an outline. The thing is, a lot of my best writing has come out of me generally figuring out where I want my story to go and I see/hear a particular... "scene"  (even though I know that's not the right word for a novel)  and the words just pop into my head. So I'm trying not to cheat. But still trying not to set myself up for failure by not preparing at all. See what a dilemma I have???

This will be a temporary post!!! It's getting yanked down in... a week. I guess. I haven't decided quite how long yet... Ok, so most of you know that I came from   urlLink  here    first. I've just posted   urlLink  this entry   , which, I believe is pretty self-explanatory. Yes,   urlLink  Kyra   , I've already planned to include the   urlLink  Achilles' Choice    post. And I will   urlLink  probably      urlLink  post      urlLink  the      urlLink  whole      urlLink  what      urlLink  really      urlLink  happened      urlLink  series   . Other than that, I haven't decided. I didn't realize just how much I had posted there... Anyway, the point is, I'm taking votes. Either   urlLink  leave comments    (they do accept html) or   urlLink  email me    with anything you found interesting or worthy of inclusion at the   urlLink  Blogger site   .  (And  that , I think, is quite enough in the way of links for one post!)

And I go! 
And the wild winds of fortune 
Will carry me onward,

 urlLink This ? I last saw this in my junior year of high school! I should have graduated from college a year ago. So it's been about   six years   since I've seen this. And I still remember the  urlLink lyrics ?!?!? I am so very, very weird.

Subject: Did I ever tell you?  

When I was praying a couple nights ago, I got to thinking about you. I wanted to make sure I told you what a big role you played in me finally letting God in. I think I may have mentioned it in passing, but I wanted to tell you specifically. You've been on my heart lately to pray for and I'm really not sure why. So...  

I remember being struck by your kindness, your firm belief in your faith without trying to force-feed it to anyone, your willingness to talk about your beliefs, to discuss them, think about them, and even argue about them with me. I was so impressed that I'd finally met a Christian who wasn't close-minded. I remember particularly one of our hikes at  urlLink COSMOS ... up at Old Man Mountain? Or Pingree? I don't remember, really... But I do remember how much sense it all seemed to make, how nothing I could say shook your belief-and not the way I'd usually found where people just tuned me out and ignored what I had to say. You genuinely considered what I had to say and then explained to me (gently) why I was wrong. You could answer my questions because they were things you had thought about yourself. What you had wasn't a blind faith, a willful shut-down of your brain so you could be on cruise-control and let someone else take the wheel; what you had was a thoughtful, rational, intimate relationship with a Being I didn't want to acknowledge. And, even though I didn't want to acknowledge Him, I couldn't help but admire your relationship. You asked me questions, and   listened   to what I had to say. You weren't judgmental; you didn't tell me I was going to Hell if I didn't believe in your God. You just made me think about my own beliefs, the same way I wanted Christians to think about theirs. I remember being amazed at your convictions and your determination to stand by them. You were the first person to change my opinion of those people called "Christians". You were the first person to show me that they weren't all hypocrites, that they weren't all using God's forgiveness as an excuse to be jerks. You were the first person who was able to show me that being a Christian doesn't mean you're perfect, it just means you try your best to be like Jesus. And it was the first time I didn't resent a Christian for not   being   perfect. You were the first person I ever saw who had a genuine, loving relationship with Jesus Christ, the first person I ever knew who was willing to sacrifice everything to please your God. And being around you was the first time I could actually   feel   peace radiating from someone. You did some amazing things to turn around my fast-developing stereotypes of "those hypocritical Christians", just by being you. I guess I just wanted to let you know that, as much as I said I was rejecting the things you told me... I wasn't. They took root and grew, and eventually bloomed with a lot of care along the way. Obviously, I still have a long way to go, but you were instrumental in helping me accept the most precious gift I've ever received. And that's something I can't thank you enough for.

Hi Tessa  

I've been meaning to respond to this for some time -- it's been on the list, but I haven't sat down to write.  It was good to hear from you -- definitely something I needed to hear, too, in the middle of some of the stuff I do online now.  Thanks for letting me know all of that -- it really means a lot to me.

Wow! I can’t believe this sat at the bottom of my personal e-mail box for just about 6 months now! Shame on me...  

So, I’m terribly curious as to “some stuff [you] do online now”. (And I’m glad the timing was good on when I sent it. God’s pretty amazing, huh?)

Well hi there... good to hear from you :)  

I do a lot of online debate and discussion.  At the time I sent the original e-mail, someone had just flamed me because of his own misperceptions about Christians, and because I'd just posted something pretty directly evangelistic.  In particular, he was upset about people who stand on street corners or come up to people in restaurants and preach to them, and he was really angry about people sharing their faith.  

I thought it was cool that, right as someone was insulting me for sharing my faith -- probably within an hour, anyway -- I got an e-mail from you talking about me sharing my faith over 5 years ago, and your e-mail contradicted every single criticism he had of me :)  Quite fittingly, last night at about 8 PM the same guy (or a close friend of his, I don't recall) posted the argument that people should keep their religious beliefs, and especially their religious activities, private... and here you are to remind me not to. So yeah, God's pretty amazing.  

   

So, yeah, God is pretty amazing... I have to agree. Seriously, how strange is it that I should respond to that e-mail just now???

Last night, I kept hearing Maria (from  urlLink West Side Story ) singing  urlLink “I feel pretty, oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and gay! And I pity, any girl who isn't me today. La-la-la-la-a-la-la-la.”  All in my head. I haven't seen it in... oh, probably well over a year. No one was watching it nearby or anything so I have no excuse.  

Today? Today I have the bit from  urlLink Fifth Element  where the guy tries to hold up Bruce Willis  and he hisses that he’s looking for casssssh. And the silly little dance. I remember noticing it, briefly the first time I saw the movie, but then when I watched it with  urlLink Ilsa , we laughed hysterically  (and rewound it about 5 times)  at that whole scene.  (What was the main character’s name? I forgot. Oh, according to the link I just sent you to, it's Korben Dallas. Incidentally, I don't exactly agree with the review but at least this gives you a good summary of the plot. Cheesy it may be, but I liked it.)  I was trying to find a link to either a picture of the guy or the transcription of the scene, but no luck. If anyone finds it, leave me a link, ok? I'd dearly love to have that! Anyway, I haven't seen that movie in... I'd guess about a year and a half.  

I’m so bizarre.

Fair warning. This is likely to be a series of non sequiturs.   

   

I've decided that I don't trust anyone my cats don't like. Cable guy was here today... he creeped me out, somewhat. Showed up without any appointment.  (Ok, seriously! What cable guy shows up without an appointment?!?!)  He said that he'd done the fussing down with the box at some other part of the apartment complex that controls several people's boxes and was just coming to check out whether or not I was getting good reception. I let him in because the guy who   did   have the appointment 2 days ago told me that someone would be working on the next level of the problem in about 2 days. I had a friend on the phone for the first part of him being there, but then later she had to go get back to work. So... I was just very, very vigilant. I didn't see anything that wasn't appropriate and he made polite conversation but... well,  you know, it's just unnerving to have some strange guy in the house without any appointments and no real warning. I had the urge to go double check everything he touched after he left  (and I actually did, to some extent. So I'm paranoid; sue me!)  just to make sure he hadn't... what? I don't know. Left a bomb, or a video camera or... I don't know, just something! Oh, and he made this comment about how there's a room down where he was fussing previously so that he can see if the various channels are coming in appropriately, mentioned that it was dark, with no windows so they didn't get glare. Later, when a particular set of channels were still not coming in properly, he asked if I wanted to go down to that (dark, windowless, and obviously lockable) room so he could prove that it was coming in right. I told him that was ok, I believed him that it was coming in just fine. What the hell?!?! Has anyone else ever been asked anything like that?!?! Because that was seriously, seriously bizarre. And disturbing. Of course, the thing that freaked me out the most was that the kittens were afraid of him. You have to understand that the kittens, while somewhat skittish around new people, like getting pet and being noticed and fussed over, so when they   ran away   from this guy, I didn't exactly take that as a good sign. I actually went and locked the door after he'd left. Very, very creepy... Maybe I was just being paranoid because of  urlLink Kyra's  bad  urlLink experience , but... better safe than sorry.  

   

Did you know  (I'm sure lots of you did...)  that cleaning (or unpacking) is much more fun if you add alcohol? I don't think I was terribly productive, actually, but at least it wasn't nearly as boring! :) I got all the boxes moved into the house from the storage area. I really wish I could find more of the wire/metal frames to put together to make shelving units. I've looked online but I must not be using the right terminology... They were all the rage not too long ago. Anyway, I need more shelves. And I've agreed to be forbidden to buy furniture until Anthony comes back home  (I have the tendency to be, shall we say, a little less than circumspect in terms of space and money management when I'm in the mood to nest)  so the only available option is the little modular wire frame ones because they break down and store easily if I go overboard. Not to mention that they're always useful, so... yeah. I haven't had a drink in quite a while. Guess it's getting to me more than I thought.  

   

I thought I had another non sequitur to add here, but... guess I don't. That's all for tonight.

It's funny, really, the things I find myself doing in Anthony's absence. Singing. Writing. Being very productive. Initially (well, in regards to the singing and the writing), I thought this was a bad sign. You know, the "real" me that I can't be around him... but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that that's who I   used   to be. And I used to sing to keep people away  (so I wouldn't get hurt)  and to keep myself from getting lonely because songs made me feel like I knew someone else, or touched a cord in me that made me feel like someone else knew me... without the attendant danger of them   actually   knowing me. And writing was a way to escape the real world, a place where I created the rules and didn't have to cope with random, inexplicable hurt or cruelty. Don't get me wrong, I   love   to write. I'm never so coherent as I am with pen and paper  (or keyboard and monitor, for the most part these days!) , and it's so liberating to be able to express myself exactly as I mean to the first time without fumbling for words or ideas the way I do when I speak. But I think that I stopped writing the stories so much because... I don't need to run away anymore. It's the same reason I don't want to go to the moon anymore... I've found   home  , and it's not scary, it's not bad, it's not traumatic. It's not smooth sailing or perfect bliss, either... but it's a hell of a lot closer to it than I ever dreamed about back when I was writing and singing to keep people away. It was just a very nice revelation this afternoon, to figure out that this wasn't a bad thing at all...

Whoo! I am  urlLink She-Ra ...   

 

Ok, so maybe not so much with the short skirt... but I've got the big boobs down pat. Um... sorry, total tangent. The point of starting this post was to say that I've been able to move a bunch of heavy furniture today, furniture which, previously, I wasn't able to move by myself. I'm terribly excited about this, seeing as how my options were to either wait until Anthony got back home or force Ilsa to help me move this stuff when she just started classes yesterday   (Whoo!!!)  , neither of which sounded like options I'd like terribly much. So... I did the stupid thing while home alone and tried to move it myself. But it worked! Everything is rearranged. The kitties are not entirely sure what they think of the moves, except that they're very, very pleased that I was thoughtful enough to provide them with a new shelf to play under. I like how things have been rearranged, really. Hopefully Anthony agrees when he gets back because I put a   lot   of work into this. Guess I'll find won't I? All in all, though it feels... refreshing to have moved things around. I'm not sure why exactly. Maybe because it felt like a lot of things just got shoved somewhere because we needed to make decisions quickly in order to get unpacked. Now that we're mostly unpacked   (except for the same 6 boxes I still haven't touched...)   it seems like there's finally enough time to move things around, to experiment and find where I like to have things best. Plus, it's nice to feel like I can make and implement decisions on my own... That's all. Just wanted to share my exitement.

So... Anthony's out in Washington D.C. for his annual conference. Which, incidentally, is why I was out there Wednesday through yesterday... Except that, obviously, he needs to stay for his conference, and I don't. So... I'm here, back home, with a week off work... and my husband is about 4,000 miles away. (Whoops, ok, I just checked, it's actually  urlLink 2,840 miles . So I was only off by a little over 1,000...) Anyway, the  point  is... I miss him. A lot. An awful lot, seeing as how I just saw him yesterday. Still... this is the first time we've really been apart since we've been married.  *thinks*  Actually, I'm almost positive it's the very first time we've been separate for evena night... And... I don't like it. At all. Silly, I guess, but I started crying on the plane, even though I'd seen him less than an hour before. But it hurt, and it felt weird to leave him there, to know I was going home to an empty house and that he wouldn't be coming home to me for a week... I was a nut last night and didn't want to watch a movie because it was something that looked like it would have an unhappy ending, with the guy about to get married and the bachelor party and all this stuff... I don't know. I just didn't want to see it. And I cried last night, too, when I went to bed. It wasn't as bad as it would have been, because  urlLink Ilsa  and I had a slumber party and watched  urlLink Miss Congeniality  and enjoyed the chick flick. Mostly we just visited and relaxed. It was nice to be home... but... then the lights went out and it was time to go to sleep, and all I could think was how   wrong   it felt not to have him next to me. Or at least in the same room. I could pretend, for a while, he was just up playing video games, but I kept waking up, reaching for him, and feeling this little catch in my throat when he wasn't there and I realized why. I know all this sounds terribly, horribly cheesy. I just... love him. And after I got off the phone with him (for the 3rd and final time) today, I started crying, because I just wanted him here so very much... and, actually, as I'm typing this, I'm tearing up yet again... I think it's going to be a   very, very long   week. So if I'm a bit mopey and whiny, please excuse me. It's ok, I'm still a newlywed, right? Less than a year??? Otherwise, just please forgive me if the newlywed excuse doesn't fly anymore.

Sorry everyone. I forgot to mention that I was leaving the state for several days. Hence no updates. I'm very tired. (Adjusting back to west coast time from being on the east coast... is a lot easier than the reverse was when we went out there!) Anyway, what I meant to do is direct you over to  urlLink The Cats Away  while I was gone. So... go read there. My good friend  urlLink Ilsa  was kind enough to watch my babies for me while I was gone and to post their thoughts so I wouldn't miss them so much... I have the next week off and I need to finish unpacking all the stuff that got shoved in storage from our move because I didn't feel like dealing with it. So I have the feeling I'll be writing here a lot. Because I'm one of the best procrastinators I know... That's all for now. Thanks.

I just wanted to thank everyone who left me comments on my previous post about  urlLink Joseph . You've all been very sweet to me and it's much appreciated. That was an incredibly hard post to write, and it's awesome to have the support. :) Thanks...  urlLink And now for something completely different. 

 . : : . ~ . : : . ~ . : : .   

 Reason #4,531 why my sister-in-law is the worst houseguest ever: After being given   (free!!!)   tickets of really good seats to a big name concert (which started at 7 pm), she shows up   AT OUR HOUSE   at 7:15. And then demands to be fed. And given alcoholic drinks.  ("Stronger! That needs more alcohol in it. No, even stronger!")  They were an hour late to the concert. 

 Reason #4,532 why my sister-in-law is the worst houseguest ever: "I can't sleep." From our bedroom doorway (after opening the door without knocking) at 6:00 am after all of us going to bed the night before at 1:30 or so. And standing there until we get out of bed to entertain her. Who the   hell   opens someone's bedroom door at 6 am after 4 and a half hours of sleep and expects the host to get out of bed and entertain you? You know, other than a 4-year old child? What if I'd been sleeping nude, thankyouverymuch! That's   our   bedroom. We're still newlyweds! What was she thinking!?!? I actually almost think she would've liked to walk in on something so she could make fun of us. Seriously. 

 Reason #4,533 why my sister-in-law  (the same woman who told me I was chopping my potatoes too small to  BOIL THEM FOR MASHED POTATOES  on her previous visit!!!!!)  is the worst houseguest ever: Standing in the kitchen  (at butt-crack-early-o'clock)  cooking eggs and Italian sausage for my sister-in-law  (because "I'm hungry." "No, I can't have any sugars. No bread. No fruit, either. It's got to be protein first thing in the morning, or I get sleepy." So go eat, drink, or  bathe  in sugar and  go the hell back to sleep  so we can crawl back into bed!!!!)  who tells me  (after just having loudly proclaimed how very hungry she is) , “You know, if you turn the heat down and put a lid on that, it won’t smoke so much.” Really? I   didn’t know that!!!   I’m cooking it fast for you, because you’re a pain in the ass!!! I very sweetly explained that I was trying to hurry on her behalf, and she says, “Oh, it’s ok. I’m not all that hungry.”   WTF?!?!?!?    

 Reason #4,534 why my sister-in-law is the worst houseguest ever: after telling us she couldn't go to church with us  (even though her daughter really,  really  wanted to go)  because she had 5 loads of laundry to do and various other household chores to take care of... she went on a shopping spree with her mom and left   later   than she would have if she'd gone to church with us. She could have at least let her daughter come with us! I mean... we go to a non-denominational church. It's not like she's going to hear something along the lines of "Repent, you sinners, or go to hell! Mwah-ha-ha-ha!" Seriously... not to mention that she wouldn't be in the main service anyway; she'd be in the children's ministries which are all about love God and love each other. She doesn't deny the existence of God, so I don't see what could be offensive in that... But, you know, her going shopping is more important than her daughter learning about God. Or even just visiting with family members who don't get to see her often.

As  urlLink promised ... long, long ago, now.  

 . : : . ~ . : : . ~ . : : .   


How could I possibly explain Joseph or the night he died? There's too much wrapped up in it all, too much for words which are so imprecise and can't really capture how it was.  

The funny thing is, when I first met him, I didn't even   like   him. Not at all. I thought he was annoying. And, while I wasn't exactly   un  kind to him, I wasn't exactly kind, either. We rode the same bus. Now, you have to understand that, when kids live as much as 20 miles outside the nearest town, riding the same bus often means that you're sitting with them for two hours (one in the morning and one in the evening) on bumpy roads. There's not a whole lot to do  (aside from determined bookworms like myself who cope with the book joggling frequently, loud noises, and often flying objects)  except for talk... or, since most of us in the back were teenagers or pre-teens, bicker and occasionally have an actual fight. Joseph was excellent at provoking both. It was his sense of humor that got him in so much trouble, really. 

Somewhere along the line, I began to admire him. Really, I think all of us root for the underdogs to some extent, unless we're cold-hearted megalomaniacs. It was more than that, though... He had about him this willingness to forgive, an invitation to everyone to forgive him as well and I began to see that, under the smart-ass remarks, he was really a sweet kid. He had, at the time, this floppy blonde hair that always got in his eyes. I was in 8th grade; he must have been in 4th. Just a year older than my kid brother.  

I remember talking with him, off and on, over the next three years or so. I think I defended him once or twice from bullies on the bus. I've always been a pretty big girl and he was one of those boys who look like they'll break in a stiff wind. He was strong though, much stronger than I gave him credit for. I remember picking up bits and pieces of his story, finding out his homelife wasn't exactly a shining example of domesticity. I remember feeling sorry for him... remember him getting mad at me for it, one of the few times I'd seen him genuinely angry. He didn't want pity.  

I didn't   really   get to know Joseph until I was a senior in high school; it was his freshman year. I'd gone through the hazing myself, my freshman year, but it wasn't anything too terrible...not for me. But I'd seen what happened to the kids who didn't keep their mouths shut, who made smart remarks and ended up, head first  (I'm saying this quite literally)  in a garbage can. It's funny, how fast that fades. By sophomore year, it felt like this far distant memory. By junior year, I never even thought about it. And then senior year rolled around. And somehow, I found myself in charge of my own little group of misfits.  (We called ourselves that, defiantly. I know, I know. All kids do that, want the importance of being  different . If you're not part of the popular crowd, then you're a misfit. And even if you  are  part of the popular crowd you, "really don't fit in with them". It's a teenage thing. I know.)  The kids who would've been thrown into the pool in the middle of the day, with nothing to change into, the kids who would have found something foul in their lunch or locker, a couple who would've probably been beaten up. I don't know why, really, but I defended them. I was Momma Tessa. I think, at that point... it wasn't any great, noble thing, to stand up to peer pressure, to defend them instead of haze them. No... it was a desire to protect someone... something... because I couldn't protect myself. I couldn't stop what was going on in my own household. But I could, and did, do something about   this  . That's all it was at first. I didn't want their friendship. I didn't want the cracks in the armor, the holes in my facade. I didn't want to be beholden to them. And somehow, they crept in, anyway. James, Tasha, Jessica, Curtis, Joseph... Somehow, they became my friends. Somehow, in a few short weeks, I found myself giving them advice, spilling my own story to them, and learning that all of them,   all of them  , had their own stories. Both of James' parents were alcoholics. Tasha's dad had died a year earlier. Jessica's parents expected her to be perfect. Curtis' dad hit him... Such short sentences to describe what happened. So brutally cold and clinical... As if the terror and rage and heartbreak of it all could be summed up in those few words. And Joseph... Joseph's story, once I heard it all, broke my heart. His dad had been married 4 times. The current step-mom, #3, used to beat Joseph with various things, especially wooden spoons. He had 3 younger siblings. Half-siblings. You know why he didn't run away? Didn't ever lash out? Because if he didn't fight it, she didn't hurt them. And the thing was, Step-mom #3 wasn't really any different than Stepmom #2 or Stepmom #1, or even Mom. Dad professed to be a Christian but either didn't know or didn't do anything about it. At least he took them to church. Because Joseph found his saving grace there, and he wouldn't have been Joseph without it. These kids were more family than I ever thought I'd have, more family than I ever thought I'd want to claim. We went through   so much   together. That year was probably the happiest for me, the happiest since I was nine and everything fell apart. The bad things kept happening at home, for all of us. They didn't go away, and they didn't get any better... but it was so much more bearable because we could go to school and have each other. Even if we didn't often talk about it, we all knew, more or less, what was going on. We all supported each other. And the thing about Joseph was... he knew how to make us all laugh. He would tell the corniest, cheesiest jokes in the world because, even while we were groaning at them, we couldn't help but laugh at his eagerness. Or he'd do these funky acrobatics. He'd look like a loon, and he didn't care. If he got you to crack a grin, well, that was good enough. It was strange, because we all knew he'd seen just as many, if not more, horrible things as we had, but there was this... innocence about him. A sense of mischief and child-like fun that all those bad things somehow didn't tarnish.  

I remember so many things about that year, and the next.  

The day Joseph, James, and Curtis cut class, wandered around the small little town our high school was in, and eventually camped out on someone's lawn. Much to their surprise, it turned out to be our principal's lawn and they were summarily escorted back to school and detention.  

I remember when we crammed 7 people into my little car that really should only have held 4. I remember Jessica, sprawling across three laps because there was no room and I couldn't see out the rear view miror if she sat up. Her head was in Joseph's lap. He had a crush on her and I thought he was going to keel over, he was so happy.  

I remember driving down a country road on a Friday night, still too many people crammed into my little car, belting out Shania Twain's  urlLink "Man, I Feel Like a Woman"  with the radio, and laughing hysterically when Joseph sang all the parts. I remember us feeling so exuberant that we put our heads out the windows and just shouted to the world because it was   good   to be alive.  

I remember Homecoming and all of us going as a group only to skip out early and end up at Village Inn, laughing and talking until the dance finished and we all had to go home and pretend we'd been there. I remember Joseph insisting that James couldn't pull any mean pranks on the waitress. I think he wanted to turn a glass of water upside down so that she'd have to spill it to pick it back up.  

I remember all of us sprawling in Tasha's room in the basement, tangled up on her bed playing some stupid card game, laughing so hard our sides hurt.  

I remember when we had a slumber party at Tasha's and, after her mom had gone to sleep, we snuck the boys in to play Truth or Dare and had to keep shushing each other so we didn't wake her up.   

I remember talking to Joseph about dating James and how he helped to set us up, even though he didn't think it was a good idea.  

I remember finding out from Tasha that James was cheating on me and crying in the back seat of my car. I remember Joseph crawling over the seat and sitting next to me, holding me while I cried, not saying anything, not needing to, just being there.  

I remember graduation, and how   proud   he was of me for graduating second in the class. He came up to congratulate me, and I started to fuss that I hadn't graduated valedictorian. He just looked at me and said, "Oh, shut up! You did damn good and we're proud of you." Somehow, that was worth more to me than all the handshakes and congratulations of the principal and my parents.  

I remember coming home after my first couple weeks of college, seeing everyone again, feeling   so different  ... and knowing it didn't matter. They still loved me, would continue to love me, and it would all be ok.  

I remember never having enough time, always having too much to do, to run back to Greeley. I remember doing it anyway. I remember deciding to date James again, telling him he was the   only   one I'd ever given a second chance to. And that I was taking a huge risk in dating him again after he cheated on me.  

I remember, less than a week later, having everyone come up to spend the night in my dorm room, just before my second semester started, and how my new roommate ended up coming early and was very, very shocked to find 7 people waiting in the room. But it ended up being fine. She fit right in, and she just laughed when I apologized for the craziness of it all, sleeping bags covering the entire floor of the (very tiny) room, far too many people crammed in, and snacks scattered everywhere. That night, for no apparent reason, Joseph started crawling like an inch-worm in his sleeping bag, scooting across the floor toward the bed. We all giggled, and thought he was doing it on purpose. To this day, I'm not sure, but he certainly convinced us that night that he was asleep. He ended up bumping into the metal frame several times before we could get a hand between his forehead and the bed. I remember finding out later that night that James was cheating on me...again. I remember sitting in my dorm room, trying not to cry, tossing it off for the moment, waiting for everyone to go to sleep, and then going outside, to the stairs, to smoke. It was freezing outside and I hadn't brought a jacket. Somehow, it felt better that way... as if the cold would freeze the hurt and the tears. Joseph came out. He didn't say anything at first, just brought me a coat. And another lighter. I was the first to break the silence. Which is funny, because, normally,   I   was the one who stayed quiet, reserved, so I could watch out for everyone, and   Joseph   was the one who would talk a lot, breaking up tension and hurt with goofy antics.  

"Why'd he do it, Joseph? What's   wrong   with him!?" Softer, looking down, not wanting to see the answer in his eyes. "What's wrong with   me  ?"   

"Tess, there's nothing wrong with you." When I looked up to say something suitably bitter to that, he shook his head and said, more forcefully, "Nothing! I mean it. James is... James. He's messed up in the head. You know his dad pulls the same crap. When he's not busy being pissed at his dad, he's busy imitating him. He loves you, in his own way. He just doesn't know what to do about it."  

"Shit." Softly, quietly, without any real rancor. It wasn't an exclamation or disbelief. It was agreement and hurt and anger and protectiveness (of him) all rolled up into one. Because I couldn't really be mad at him, because I knew Joseph was right. But it still hurt. "So, now what? I go in there, break up with him? Again. For the same thing. I try not to say all the hurtful things I'm thinking. And he goes back to life as normal, while I sit here, feeling like a moron?"  

"We'll figure it out, Tess. We always have before."  

"I suppose so. It's not like we haven't survived worse." I gave him a half-hearted grin. He smiles back, but it fades pretty quickly. He starts to speak, and then shuts his mouth. And he does it again. "Well, spit it out. I'm too tired, too worn out to bite right now." I grin a little.  

"Why did you date him again? Why did you give him a second chance?"  

"I don't know..." I look at him. "That's not the question you planned to ask, is it?"  

He shakes his head. "No... why didn't you give me just one chance?"  

"Honest?" He nods. "Because I love you too much. Because, if we dated, and it turned out like   this  ," I waved toward the dorm window, "I'd lose you. I know! I know, you would never in a million years cheat on me. But there are so many things that could go wrong. And... everything I touch, turns to shit. I won't do that to you. James can handle it. James has dished it out himself. I don't... feel guilty that it's falling apart. Because, no matter what you say, there   is   something wrong with me. I can't let people in, that close. I start driving them away. I   can't   lose you. And... you deserve better than me. You deserve someone who will let you in, someone who will really treasure you. And I don't know how to be that girl." I looked at him, saw him crying. "I wish I did."   We sat out there, on the back step, for almost an hour. Just... talking. About our dreams and plans for the future, about things we didn't know about each other, about favorite colors and foods and absurd childhood memories... I think that night is pretty much the last time I saw Joseph before he died. There were a couple of quick hello's, a brief stint in a bowling alley where there were so many people... there were phone calls, of course, and we'd talk for such a long time. That night made us so much closer. I was always thankful that he didn't take what I'd said as a clichéd brush off. It wasn't. I really meant it, every word. He was... the only one of us who was still innocent, still sweet. I felt like, somehow, I would contaminate him if I let him get that close. The funny thing is... we got so much closer as friends than I ever would have let him be as a boyfriend. And sometimes I regret it... sometimes I wish we   had   started dating. But most of the time, I'm just thankful. I was far, far too broken at that point, and he would have tried to put together the pieces. He probably would have succeeded, too... but it would have scarred him. I don't know if any of that makes sense.  

I remember the night Joseph died, in crystal clarity. I remember the original plans that night. I was going to go out with Alicia, Mandy, James, and Joseph.  (Curtis was, by now, signed on with the Marines. Jessica had moved away. Tasha was just grounded.)  But I was trying so hard to work on forgiving people, on giving second chances. Not like I'd given James, not being stupid and waiting for someone to walk on me, but just normal, human forgiveness. It made Joseph happy. So I bailed on them that night. A guy I'd dated before who had (what is it with me???) cheated on me and openly, casually admitted it, had contacted my best friend, asked her to arrange for a meeting with me. So he could apologize and ask for my forgiveness. So I bailed on them, sat there in the restaurant, waiting for Nate to be off swing shift. We talked there, in Denny's on 8th Ave... until something like 3 am. Maybe it was 4, I don't know. He asked me to come back to his place, so we could continue talking. I didn't really plan on doing that, but I didn't want to stop talking to him either. I don't know why, but I told him I wanted to check my messages on the dorm phone. I checked them. There was one, from my roommate, saying she had to leave for class and the room was a disaster and she was   really, really   sorry. She'd pick it up when she got back. I laughed. I was still smiling at her when the next message started playing. The smile didn't last long.  

"Tess? Tess? Dammit!" Alicia's voice. Crying. I started thinking of all the things that could have happened. Her dad had punched her again, she lost her temper and hit him back... no, no, she wouldn't be crying, she'd be feeling triumphant. James' dad drinking again? "Look, it's Joseph. Just... just call me when you get this, ok?" Call came in at midnight.  

Next message. "Tess? Fuck! Where   are   you? Get down here as soon as you can." One am.  

Last message. "Son of a bitch! Where in   hell   are you? I didn't want to tell you on a damn machine! Look, there was... there was an accident." I remember, quite literally, feeling the blood drain from my face. "Joseph... Joseph's hurt really bad. He's unconscious. The doctors won't tell us anything. His dad's here. They think it's our fault. It's not. It was an accident. We're at the Greeley hospital. Just get the hell down here, ok? Call me." Two am.  

I remember swaying, thinking, distantly, that I was going to pass out. I slid to the floor. I could see the black receiver dangling in front of me. Beeping. Disconnected line. I don't know how long I sat there. Nate came over, started to make a joke about me being a popular girl. Saw my face. Asked what happened. I tried... couldn't tell him. "I... Joseph... he's... the hospital." I fumbled for my keys. My purse was still at the table. I tried to leave. Didn't pay. Nate grabbed my arm. Made me promise not to drive, said he'd drive me. I said something about how I couldn't leave my car here. He said he'd drive me in my car then. Took the keys from me. Told me to sit down while he took care of the tab and getting all our stuff. I remember sitting down and being utterly, utterly terrified.  I wasn't there. I should have been there. I was supposed to be there. But I wasn't there. Wasn't there. Should have been. Wasn't.  We got there, I'm pretty sure in record time, but it wasn't fast enough. I charged into the hospital, Nate managed to find out where Joseph was and steered me in the right direction. I just remember frantically punching the elevator button, over and over. I saw everyone in the waiting room. I don't think I even introduced Nate or thanked him. He just, very gracefully, slipped to the background. I saw everyone, all the people I was supposed to protect, and all I could think about was Joseph who I hadn't even been there to keep safe. I remember asking what happened. Getting garbled bits of information. He was in Alicia's truck. Well, no, he started in James' truck. He was in the back of Alicia's truck and he fell out the back. He hit his head. James: "Tess, I just saw my best friend   bounce   in front me. I almost rolled the truck swerving to miss him. And all I could think was, don't let me hit him. Don't let me hit him." He's got a concussion. We think. Probably clots in his brain. He's unconscious. He's in a coma. He's not going to wake up. He looks almost fine, like he's just sleeping. But we couldn't wake him up. Days dripped by. We just... sat in the waiting room. Trying to avoid Joseph's family. All 3 of the step-mother's came by at different points, so did his mom. His dad was there almost constantly. His brothers and sisters, aunts, cousins all stopped by. And all we wanted to do was scream at them to go away because he was   ours  , not theirs. Had never   been   theirs, would   never   be theirs. Except maybe for his siblings.  

After 4 days, the doctors came in to the waiting room, told us they had good news. Joseph had woken up very briefly, and wanted to see his friends. The doctors said only one, and his dad chose James. We sat there, waiting, daring to hope for the first time in what felt like forever. And then James came back, ashen-faced, to say that they'd made a mistake and Joseph wasn't actually awake, hadn't been awake, and was, in fact, getting worse. It was someone else who was getting better. I remember, we each had to go away at different points. The world didn't stop just because our lives were on hold. Liz, Alicia, and Mandy had to go to work. I skipped classes, called and cancelled all my shifts. I didn't care. I didn't care about any of that at all, because I could feel, bit by bit, Joseph slipping away from us all, and there was   nothing   I could do about it. But I was going to be the bridesmaid in my (chosen) cousin's wedding. I went back to the dorms, because that's where she was supposed to pick me up. I sat on the front steps of the hall and cried and raged. This guy came up to me, someone I knew to be a Christian from previous conversations, and he asked me if I was ok. I remember looking at him and thinking,  What the hell is wrong with you? Do I  look  like I'm ok?  and realizing that he didn't know how else to ask me what was wrong. "No, I'm not. My best friend is in the hospital because of a stupid accident that I should have been there to stop and he's   dying  . No, I'm not ok." He stood there, looking down at me sitting on the step with this terrible expression of pity on his face. And I started to get angry because I didn't want, and Joseph didn't need some stranger's pity. And then he asked if he could pray for me. I thought,  What the hell? It can't  hurt  anything at this point.  I just nodded. So he started praying. And I thought, with all my heart, with everything that was in me, just one word,   PLEASE  . Everything was rolled into that. If you're there, if there is a God,   save   him. Make him better, bring him back to me. Don't make me face this without him. And a bargain. An offer to do whatever it took, anything, anything at all, if he could just be ok. I remember feeling better after that, being able to cope with the rehearsal dinner and 50 people I barely knew. I remember flying back to the hospital, hoping that it had made some difference, that he was doing better. But he wasn't. The next day was the wedding, and it was beautiful. I actually even laughed a couple times. A couple days later, one of the few times we were all there together, the doctors came in to talk to Joseph's dad. They took him out in the hallway. We tried, desperately, to eavesdrop. He came back in, white faced and shaking. He told us that Joseph was brain-dead. That there was no activity at all and no way for it to come back. He tried to be gentle with us. I think. I remember us all falling in a circle, holding onto each other and just... sobbing. James didn't cry. Neither did Alicia. They just stood there, with no idea of how to let go, feeling horribly, horribly responsible for it all. I held... I don't know, several people. I remember rocking, and rocking, and rocking, letting everyone else cry, being able to cry while I held them. And then they let us go to see him one last time before they pulled the plug, before they donated all the useable parts to someone who needed them. Joseph would have liked that, would have been happy he was helping others, right to the very end. But it just made us bitter. Because someone else would have Joseph close to them and we wouldn't.  (I know that sounds terribly macabre. It's just... we hurt,  so much , that it made an awful kind of sense.)  And we got to say goodbye. He looked so damn peaceful there, in spite of all the tubes and lines running from him. Eyes closed, breathing steadily (even if it was because of a machine), he just looked like he was asleep. I remember going over, standing at the foot of his bed and willing him to just   wake up  , to prove the doctors wrong. I remember touching his hand, holding it, and for the very first time ever, not feeling him squeeze my hand back. Somehow,   that   made it real. I whispered to him, all the things I was sorry for, the things I hadn't done or did do that I regretted, the things he'd done that made my world better, how much I loved him and would miss him... and as much as it hurt, it felt so good to be able to say all that, even knowing he couldn't hear me, wouldn't know what I was saying.  

Sometimes, I think Joseph is what held our group together. I may have been the matriarch, so to speak but... I wasn't the glue. We fell apart after his death. We were all so angry, and so hurt. Things got said that shouldn't have been. We've all drifted so far apart. There are a lot of things I would do differently if I had it to do over again. 

You know, I remember thinking, for a few days after he died, after the funeral, that it didn't feel real. I didn't see him often enough for it to feel different at first.  Oh, you know, he's just busy with farm chores and school and his girlfriend.  And then it would hit, like a fist in the stomach and I couldn't   breathe  , that he was gone, gone, gone, not coming back, not ever. And I started drinking. A lot. A   whole   lot. And I ran away that summer to California. And then my whole world turned upside down, all over again. Because God found me and I fell in love with Anthony...

Weirdness... I'm working on writing the post about Joseph that I  urlLink promised , and in remembering everything, I have the strongest urge to go get a cigarrette. I mean, I can taste it in my mouth, exactly the way it felt, tasted, smelled when I was smoking... Funny thing, that... it seems like it's part of the memory. Like having a cigarette in my hand, taking a drag, is all part of remembering him.

I love my grandmother. No, really. I do.   I DO!   It's just that... well... she drives me crazy. I mean... ok, here's an example of a pretty normal conversation for us.  

 
  GM:      So, you got a jury summons in the mail today, for Theresa Hower.  

  ME:      What? Why did I get a jury summons sent to your house? And why is it in my maiden name?  

  GM:      I don't know.   *suspiciously*   They normally send these from the DMV records. You   did   go to the DMV, right?   

  ME:      Gramma,   *shaking my head*   you've seen my new license. Yes, I've been to the DMV, long since. I'll see what I can find out.  

  GM  :      *barely mollified*   All right. But see what you can find out about it.   

  ME:      Ok.   *again shaking my head... because, obviously, that's not, in fact, what I just said I'd do*   Anyway, do you want to just forward it to me?  

  GM:      I guess.   *abrupt subject change.*   So, we have to get together this week.  

  ME:      Um... probably not. We've got a lot going on this week, and we're leaving on Wednesday for our trip to Washington, D.C. and since we work all week, we'd planned on packing this weekend.  

  GM:      Well, we're leaving on the 29th to go to Copenhagen, so we'll be leaving before you get back.  

  ME:      Actually, I'm coming back on the   *brief hesitation*   28th.   (I actually come back on the 27th, but I KNOW my grandmother, and if I tell her that, she'll insist on seeing me that day.)    

  GM:      Well, that's no good. I'll be packing that day. So it will just have to be this week. Hank and I are going sailing Friday and Saturday, but we'll be back Saturday night.  

  ME:      Well,   *shaking my head in resignation.*   what about lunch on Sunday?  

  GM:      Oh, good. When do you think you can come down?  

  ME:      No, I was thinking you could join us at a restaurant near the church. Anthony's dad is coming down on Saturday around 1 to celebrate Father's Day, which means I'll be spending the morning cooking and getting everything ready. They'll probably stay until about 5 or so and then we'll be cleaning up. Then Sunday we'll going to service and I'll teach the kids. No offense, but when we go to your house, we always end up staying for a really long time. That won't leave me much of the weekend to pack. Monday and Tuesday we have stuff going on, too, so it really can't wait ve...  

  GM:        *snarking*   Well, he’s sure been down a lot lately.  

  ME:      What? What are you talking about? He hasn’t been down since... since... I’m not sure, but it’s been since before we moved. He hasn’t seen the new place yet. I think it was Easter the last time they came our way. We went up there for my birthday.  

  GM:        *still snarking*   No, I'm sure he's been down more recently than that.  

  ME:      No. Anyway, why don't we get together just for lunch at this restaurant on Sunday and then plan on getting together later on for a long visit, on a Saturday or something?  

  GM:      So when, about 1:30? Why don't you just call me... oh wait.   *still more snarking while utterly ignoring my very reasonable suggestion*   You can't. You don't have a cell phone.  

  ME:      Gramma,   *shaking my head for the fiftieth time during this conversation*   Anthony's got a cell phone. He'll give you a call when you should head in our direction.   

  GM:      I guess that will work. But you haven't seen the house and all the work we've done with the yard.  

  ME:      Gramma,   *firmly holding on to my patience before it flees in horror before this onslaught*   we really can't come over for a long visit just before we're going across the country. Either I can come by myself on the 28th and talk to you while you pack, or we can come down after the trip on a weekend and really visit.  

  GM:      So, you'll make sure to call me in enough time to get to the restaurant, right?  

  ME:      Yes, Gramma.   *trying, desperately, not to sigh out loud*  
 

Because, you know... it's perfectly acceptable for   her   not to be available because she has to pack, but, evidently, it's   not at all   acceptable for us not to be available because   we   have to pack. And I'm not about to tell my grandmother that I'm probably going to be getting a cell phone here very shortly. Because then she'd think the snarking did it and well, I'm sure you can see where things would go from there! Next thing you know, there would be snarking about children... oh, wait! That already happens!  

The thing about all this is (or rather, several things about all this)... this is normal. It happens on a regular basis. And it's not just me! Ask any of my cousins! They'll tell you! And, while it would be perfectly reasonable to have such conversations if my grandmother were senile or something... She's NOT! She was 17 when she had my mom; Mom was 21 when she had me; I'm only 23, which means Gramma is  (barely)  60!  (Her b-day isn't until September.)  There is nothing wrong with her mi... uh, let me re-phrase that. She's just as sharp as she's always been. This is not some "I'm old and confused so just humor me" lady. Which makes conversations like this one so very, very baffling. And frustrating. But I   DO   love her.  

You know? Suddenly, I have this weird feeling that she’s not coming back and she knows she’s not coming back and this is her way of saying goodbye. And I suddenly feel very, very guilty. Damn, she's good!

Do you ever feel like, sometimes, you've forgotten how to have conversations? Or is that just me? I had lunch with a co-worker today and I couldn't figure out what to talk about. Other than my kittens. But seriously, that gets old after a while. Well, for everyone else, that is. But I just... couldn't quite figure out how to make pleasant conversation. Anything she told me flew right back out of my head so I couldn't even encourage her to talk about... whatever it was she'd been talking about. I think it's just being tired. It's hard to sleep with kittens running across your body at 2 am.

Ok, ok. I know. I've been wretched about posting. The problem is  (aside from my obsession with the kittens)  there's really just been too much going on. I get started on a post and then real life intrudes and I have to go take care of things. The good news is that we got two more boxes unpacked last night, courtesy of an ex-neighbor and new friend Cynthia, along with 3  (big, they were really  big , ok???)  blue bins of stuff. Which leaves only 5 boxes left, ignoring the insane number of boxes of books that I have. But those will be easy to unpack. And the cat stuff got moved from what will be the permanent spots to our bedroom because, according to the lady who's keeping them, they have an easier transition if they start out in a small room and then get to go to a bigger room before they have free run of the house. Which makes sense because it's going to be a big change to go from 17 other kittens in the room to just the two of them for our whole apartment. So they start in a small room with us which means all their stuff (food, litter box, water...) are in our bedroom, too. Then they can go back to what will be their normal spots.  (This is massively boring to everyone else, isn't it? Sorry...)  Anyway, the point of all that is, real life intrudes, yet again. I have at least 7 different posts started, things I want to think about, talk about, write out, and figure out... But they'll likely be put on hold for another week or so as we get used to having kittens and they get used to having us. :)

So, I got to go see the kitties tonight. They got spayed today so in order to see them, I had to promise to be   very   calm and   very   quiet... Not that it was terribly difficult, mind you. They didn't feel much like playing, so it's not exactly like I'd want to rough them up.  

I had a dream earlier in the week that Reilly died in the operation to get her fixed, and the most horrible part was that my only response was, "Oh well. I guess we'll take Maddie home instead."  (Maddie is another litter-mate.)  So I've had periodic freak-outs this week as Gwynnie inched closer and closer to the mandatory 2 pounds (at which, incidentally, she just   barely   squeaked under the wire as of this morning!) and I worried that Reilly for some unknown reason wouldn't be ok. So of course I pestered the woman who's fostering them as soon as decently possible this afternoon to make sure they were ok. She said they were fine, and that I could come over this evening.  

So we went on over, and there was this heart-stopping moment when I walked in and saw Reilly lying bonelessly at the front of the cage, so, so, so still. I couldn't see her breathing at all. I gingerly opened the door (fending off other inquisitive kittens, which is why the cage was closed in the first place) and reached out to pet her. I nearly had a heart   attack   when she moved just before I actually touched her... because at that point, I was convinced she was dead. She wasn't, of course, just very, very zonked out from the anesthesia. Gwynnie was doing much better. She wasn't up and walking around like (ironically enough) Maddie who seemed to have come through it more quickly than the rest, but she was more alert. She started purring as soon as I touched her. That's a sound to make a mommy's heart feel all warm and fuzzy! So we cuddled them (according to Anthony) for 45 minutes or so (I'm not sure, it certainly didn't seem that long!) and then had to go. Because, really, staying over at someone else's house for hours on end is not exactly proper etiquette.  

As we were leaving, I couldn't help but laugh at the thought that those 45 minutes are probably the longest Gwynnie has ever held still without being asleep. She's such a feisty one! :) Oh, I just can't wait. Less than 48 hours now and my babies will be home with me. Oooh! :)

I'm back. :) And... and...  I GET TO BRING MY BABIES HOME NEXT WEDNESDAY!!!!  So in a week and a half, I will have Gwynnie and Reilly home! Oh, I can't even begin to tell you how enormously excited I am about all this!!!! Reilly, as of yesterday, is exactly two pounds, and Gwynnie only has three ounces to go! Since she gained   five   ounces last week, she should be fine. The vet said that as long as she's within an ounce or two of the 2 pound mark, she'll be fine. So... all she   really   has to gain is one ounce. So this week we're going to be finishing the last of the unpacking... and then we're getting all the new kitty stuff!!! Oh, I'm just so excited, I can't see straight! Or really think about anything else. Which I guess you might have gathered.  *grins sheepishly*   

Anyway, I have to ask... Am I insane? I've started worrying about their upcoming surgeries, worrying about whether or not it will all go well or what... I know, it's absurd. They do this all the time and nothing goes wrong. We've waited extra long, just to make sure that they're big enough and that everything will go right. And still, I can't help it... I know they're just cats... and I know the amount of time I'm spending thinking and worrying about them is more on a par with fussing over small children. I realize all these things and still am obsessing over the kittens.  

Oh, for anyone who was wondering, I had a fabulous weekend, and an absolutely lovely birthday. We went to go see  urlLink Always... Patsy Cline   (here's the  urlLink official site )  which was a really awesome play. Not to mention that I dearly love going to the theater and just about anything or anyone could've been onstage and I'd have been thrilled. Honestly, though, it was very cool. They did a fantastic job. We had a big party at the restaurant on Friday, Saturday we went to someone else's BBQ, Sunday I taught the kids, Anthony went to the  urlLink air show  because I shooed him off so he could actually see it, and then Monday we had our own BBQ and I got to see my babies. Whoo! Whirlwhind weekend. That's all for the moment. Hopefully, when I get home, I will have internet access again and be able to write some of these posts I've been planning...

Ok, for anyone who was confused and/or tried to e-mail me basically since I set up this website, sorry for the misunderstanding. I just realized that half of my template gave one e-mail address, and the other half gave a different one. The place to send me e-mail (and all the links are fixed, now, incidentally) is  urlLink havechosen@webmail.diaryland.com . In my template I have the "[removethis]" segment so I don't get spam. And please don't   send   me any spam, because, I promise, I   don't   need any! I've got more than enough, thankyouverymuch. And thank you Sammy for getting the webmail un-broken!  

And yes, I know neither this post or the previous one is about what I  urlLink promised  they'd be. The Joseph post is still in progress  (and that's far harder to write than I'd thought it would be) , and I haven't even started on the one about my brother. Be patient. I have at least 2 other good posts lined up besides these two. They're on the way. Eventually.  

It's just that I have no internet at home until June 1st. And I'm taking tomorrow, Friday, and Monday off, so I won't be back to work until June 1st. You know, I   hated   that my birthday was so close to Memorial Day weekend as a child. None of my friends could ever come to my parties, and I couldn't go camping because everyone and his (or her) brother as well as the brother's neighbor was out camping that weekend. Now? Now I'm blissfully aware of the fact that, generally speaking, I get a free day off somewhere around my birthday.  

I know, I know, that's terribly disrespectful. And please don't think I don't honor our servicemen and women who have fallen on that day, because I have more respect for our military than... than... can't think of the right phrase just now. Sorry. I'm proud of our men and women in uniform. Let's leave it at that.  (Even if right now I'm terrified because one of my cousins wearing that uniform is being sent to Iraq in the next month or two... as part of the ground troops. Someday soon, I'll tell you about Robbie.)   

Anyway, I guess that was an exceedingly scattered post. Oh! Before I go... Reilly only has 3 ounces left to make it to the 2 pound mark so she can be fixed and come home with me. Gwynnie still has 8 ounces to go... We're hoping to bring them home around the middle of the week of the 7th. Hoping Gwynnie gets big enough by then because I really don't want to wait another three weeks after that...   

Really leaving now...

I have my husband back. I can't even begin to tell you how ecstatic I am about this. See, he's been working on this final project which was actually due April 24th, but his professor gave him an extension because of insane (inconsiderate) family members. Although at the time... eh, never mind, I'm not going into it. Anyway, since he was given the extension, he didn't work on his project   AT ALL  . Not in the slightest. And then about a week before our move, he e-mails the professor and says, "Would it make any difference on my grade if I turned in the project?" His professor wrote back and told him that if he didn't turn it in by the 22nd, he would fail. So he's been working frantically to get his project finished during the weeks when we   should   have been packing--which turned into just me packing, and endless, ridiculous fights. Because I was frustrated at having to pack alone when the whole point of moving in the middle of the month and coping with prorated rent for both places was so that we'd have 3 weeks after his project was due for packing and moving and having it be low-stress. And he was frustrated because I wouldn't leave him alone to work on his project, as well as being massively stressed out because he wasn't sure he could finish it in time. The project was finished and e-mailed on the 21st, and    I HAVE MY HUSBAND BACK!!!    He joked with me this weekend. He started a tickle attack, which since he's much, much more ticklish than I am, is something he's bound to lose and he   never   starts one if he's in a bad mood. And the unpacking that happened this weekend? Was so non-stressful, I can't even tell you how wonderful it was! And I didn't have to do it by myself! Whoo!  

That's all. I just wanted to let you know how excited I am to have my husband back, the loving, wonderful, silly man I married.

Long, long, long overdue! Hope you'll forgive me,  urlLink Kyra ! These are from  urlLink this post .  

 Questions, questions, questions! I love this game 1) What's the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? 2)What are the thing(s) that make your life worth living? 3)What's your biggest regret?  

Ok, the most beautiful thing I've ever seen? It's hard to choose, actually. I can think of half a dozen things offhand... the sight of Anthony's face when I first realized I was falling in love with him, the way he was looking so gentle, making silly noises and changing his voice to read a story to my 5-year-old cousin... and there is   nothing   like a Colorado sunset after a thunderstorm, the way everything seems brand new and shiny, the colors in the sky are an utterly indescribable orange and red and purple, colors that should seem angry but somehow aren't, and the mountains are such a deep, deep blue it feels like falling... holding my infant cousin in my arms and watching her fall almost instantly asleep, feeling her weight and her steady breathing and knowing this made me full somehow... my first sight of the ocean as a teenager, with leaden clouds swirling above and the ocean below so angry, lashing out at the shore, and yet somehow seductive as well, calling me to come in... but I think the most beautiful thing I've ever seen is my God holding His hand out to me, inviting me not to just walk His path, but to walk by His side, to know that I would never be alone, and that He would always love me. I guess maybe that all sounds a little cheesy...   

Onto the next one. What makes my life worth living? Oh, so very, very much. I think the simplest answer to that is, quite honestly, the variety and uncertainty of life in general. I do know that bad things will happen. It's a fact of life and not anything anyone can get around. But there are such amazing possibilities out there! There are so many things to discover, to explore, to find out, whether that's the nature surrounding us or the nature within us or the nature of us... There is so much to understand, so much to learn. Don't get me wrong, as much as I adore finding out new information, I don't know that any of it would be worth it without love. Yet again with the cheesiness and the cliche's, but all the same... It hurts sometimes, actually, a   lot   of times, but that spark, that joy, even that pain is what makes life   living  ... and it's also what makes it   worth   living.    

My biggest regret? You aren't holding any punches, are you,  urlLink Kyra ? That's a hard one to decide. I think it's a toss up between the night I didn't go with my friends, didn't stop Joseph from making a stupid decision that cost him his life and the day I betrayed my brother. In the long run, I'd have to say I regret more the day I betrayed my brother. Even though I think I could have stopped the accident that took Joseph's life... he made his decision, and he made it with full knowledge of what it could cost. Nicky doesn't have anyone to protect him, doesn't have any choices he   can   make, and that's much, much worse.  (Next couple of posts will explain those to items in detail. Promise.)  I think if there was just one thing I could go back and change, it would be that day.

Hey, go check this out:  urlLink Add-A-Line . It's something I've started. Head over there and give me the next line. :) You can either leave it in the comments section or e-mail me with it... I think I've got it set up to automatically post when you e-mail it to the first address listed at the top. I'm not positive, though, and it seems to object to e-mails that aren't plain text, so if you're an Outlook user and you have it set to html or something, it'll probably bounce back to you. I'm still learning... :) Anyway, I'm terribly excited about this! Please keep it relatively clean... but I can't wait to hear your ideas. Um, well, see them that is... :)

So many thoughts running through my head. I know I've been a bum about writing. Do you know, as of tomorrow, it will be two years that I've been writing something like this? The first one I started (well, rather, that a friend set up for me) was on May 21, 2002. And I wrote there until I started this one a month and a half ago. Crazy stuff. The only reason I remember that is because tomorrow is Alicia's birthday.

Oh, and because I know you're all as fascinated by the  urlLink kittens  as I am, here's the latest update. First of all: They're mine! :) Whoo! I passed the tests. So no one else will be taking my babies home. Unfortunately, neither will   I   until they get bigger. Even though Reilly was the runt of the litter, Gwynnie is the one who isn't growing very quickly. Reilly's turning into a little chunk. Every time I see her, her little tummy is   sooo   full! But Gwynnie... well, Gwynnie has   more important   things to do than waste her time   eating  . I mean, really. The food doesn't move or go anywhere or try to pounce her, so why should she pay any attention to it? They're trying to give her a different kind of food to see if that will help. So far, the change in diet only made her tummy exceedingly unhappy. We'll see if it ends up helping once she gets used to it. The thing is, I've seen what happens when she eats. If the other kittens aren't there trying to push her away, she doesn't bother to eat. It's not interesting unless there's someone to play with. She eats because everyone else is eating and that's the only way to get them to play with her. If no one else is there and they're giving her special food that she doesn't need to argue with any of the other kittens to get, I don't think she's going to eat much at all. Which really defeats the purpose. But oh, they're adorable! They really are. Gwynnie is the more active of the two, and much more feisty. It's funny, because, from the pictures, I had thought that Reilly would be the feisty one and Gwynnie the calm one. I was so, so, so wrong! Until the most recent time I visited, Reilly was far more interested in curling up someplace. "You can pet me," she seemed to be saying, "but I'm not going to get up or go anywhere for it. I don't mind the petting' it's actually quite pleasant, and I might even purr for you. Just don't expect me to have to make an effort for it." Gwynnie, on the other hand, was climbing all over everyone and everything, pouncing tails, ears, fingers, toes, small furry mice, and basically anything that held still for long enough to be pounced.

Hey, sorry for so few posts lately. I really do still have a couple of good ideas rattling around somewhere in my head. However, they've been superseded by the following announcement:  

   I CAN HAVE KITTENS 
IN OUR NEW 
APARTMENT!!!!!!!!!     

In case you missed that, let me just repeat:  

    I CAN HAVE KITTENS 
IN OUR NEW 
APARTMENT!!!!!!!!!      

Whoo! And I've found the kittens I want to bring home. They're currently at a rescue shelter called  urlLink The Itty Bitty Orphan Kitty Rescue Shelter . Ok, first of all, how can you resist a shelter named something like that?? Seriously! So, here we go, the first introduction:   

Meet  urlLink Reilly   

        

And  urlLink Gwynith   
       

How could you possibly resist these two??? I mean, really? So, I'm still going through the interview process, where they decide whether or not I'm a suitable candidate. I submitted the written application today and was invited to come meet Gwynnie and Reilly, so I think I've passed the first test. Think good thoughts in my direction and, while it may be a silly thing to pray about, I'm also asking for prayers. I don't know why, but of all the kittens I looked at through  urlLink Petfinder , these two just tugged at my heart strings. I think, silly as it may sound, that I would be heart-broken if I couldn't bring these two home. Don't get me wrong, I would still go look for another kitten or kittens, but... I'd be very disappointed initially.   

So, obviously, I have kittens on the brain and very little else. I'll tell you what, though, those two cuties have given me more motivation to finish packing up my house than anyone or anything else has! So, I'll be disconnected starting either tomorrow or the day after until we get moved. Not so much because the connection will be shut down but simply because I need to pack my computer and quit collecting junk over here. So... I'll be back. Promise. Just may take a week or two. And then, prepared to be flooded with posts about kittens.

I had the most disturbing dream last night...  (Incidentally, in case you were wondering, the post title was supposed to be a play on the song title: California Dreamin'. I'm lame, yes, yes, I know. Thanks for sharing.)  So yes, I realize that dreams are of interest to no one but the dreamer, but this is my journal. :) And I'd really like to think out what exactly it means. So, I guess you could always go look at  urlLink some random post , although there aren't that many here...   

It started out with me at... a high school football game? A play? Something. And I saw Mom and Dad and Larry sitting in the bleachers a little ways away. Far enough that we couldn't just shout to hear each other, close enough to see facial expressions clearly. Dad wouldn't look at me; Mom looked... I don't know. I can't remember now. I don't think I even saw whether or not there was an expression on her face. The only word that comes to mind now is "neutral" but I really don't remember what her face looked like. And Larry... Larry looked at me and tried to smile, except it came out more as a grimace than anything else. But I could tell he was trying. So I went to go see them after the game (play?) was over, and I thought I was just trying to ask about reconciliation, but somehow, it became about me going back to live with them.  

So, the next thing I know, we're in Old Blue (pickup truck), "we" being me, Mom, and Larry. Mom was driving  (which is all wrong, because Larry never lets anyone else drive)  and we were talking... I guess about how things were going to be. After a bit, Larry nodded, as if he were satisfied, and then, just... got out of the truck. We didn't stop, or anything, he just, opened the door, stepped out, and was at the farm.  (I don't know! It's a dream!)   

So, Mom and I talked. I think some more about what the ground rules would be for me to stay there. And then we got to the farm, and, of course, Larry was already there. So I came in and, suddenly, it was night.  

I go into my parents' bedroom, I don't remember why exactly, now, a bad dream, maybe? That's really the only reason I'd go into their room at night... And instead of being Mom and Dad in the bed, it was Mom and Larry. And the fact that it was Larry instead of Dad didn't faze me. Mom told me to climb in (which is what makes me think I was going in there with a bad dream; I used to have nightmares, and I would go crawl into bed and tell Mom about it and get hugged and then go back to my own bed, even when I was much too old to still be needing comforting from nightmares), and I obediently did. Except that then Mom was gone and it was just Larry and he was naked. Erk.   

Then it was morning, and it was... I don' t know, business as usual, I guess. I got up to work on my chores, cleaning the bathroom, specifically, and then I woke up.   

 . : : . ~ . : : . ~ . : : .   

Ok, easily dismissed aspects:   

 -finding Larry next to me in bed, naked. That's often been a recurrent nightmare left over from what happened. Not unusual that it would be woven in with a dream about them. 
 -seeing Mom and Larry in bed together. Manifestation of the facts. I've heard them not seen them together, but same difference in dream land.   

Things to consider:
 -I was alone in the dream. Anthony wasn't there with me. Which, I guess, makes sense because a good portion of all of this needs to be worked out between me and my family and Anthony isn't an actor on this stage; he's support. 
 -What started out as a petition for some sort of reconciliation turned into me being utterly submissive to Larry, and things being back to a normal which was anything but. Figuring out how to reconcile is something I haven't really faced. Not in any realistic way. I've thought about reconcilation with my parents if he wasn't there, what I'd say, what I'd do, what we'd need to discuss. I've intellectually grasped that Larry isn't going anywhere and, in order for there to   be   a reconcilation in real life, I will have to take Larry into account. It's not something I've grasped emotionally, yet. But I think I'm starting to, which is where this bit of the dream comes in. Larry cannot accept having anyone part of his life in any significant way without being in control of that person. If I came back into the picture, I   would be   significant, not necessarily to him  (although I think I would be, even though neither of us would want it)  but definitely for my parents and for Nicky.  (Nick. He's 18 now, I shouldn't call him Nicky anymore.)  And that would be an aspect that he couldn't control. I don't think he's capable of handling that because it means his world isn't safe. And he would force my parents to make a choice between him and me. I've already lost that contest once. I doubt the outcome would be any different a second time. So was this about getting myself to accept that reconcilation is pretty near impossible? Because I can't go back to being who I was... and I   wouldn't   even if I thought I was   capable   of doing it. 
 -My dad is pretty much nowhere in this dream. Is that because I've already got a reconcilation, of sorts, with him? Or is it because he wouldn't be the major influence... or, if I'm being brutally honest, any influence... in a situation like this? 
 -Does this have anything to do with my recent obsession with possibly moving to Colorado? We'd pretty much laid it to rest about moving out there, until the  urlLink GPB launch . And now, I realize just how much the  urlLink JIMO  project would mean to Anthony. It's amazing to me that he would be willing to give that up, just because I think (thought?) I'd be unhappy moving back to Colorado. So I've been contemplating re-opening that discussion... which would mean, obviously, a greater chance of moving back to Colorado. And that's a whole 'nother list of pros and cons I'm not ready to face yet. 

I guess those are pretty much all of the things I see that I needed to talk out.

I hope you don’t mind terribly, but I wanted ask for your prayers for my mother. My mom has lived with major problems with her knees since childhood. Recently, there’s been a very frightening bout where there was a great deal of uncertainty as to what was causing her current pain. Possibilities from  urlLink meningitis  to  urlLink MS  to  urlLink Lou Gehrig’s disease  were discussed, but none of the doctors really seemed to know what was wrong or how to fix it. I got an e-mail from my dad yesterday saying my mom went to go see a specialist. Praise God that it looks like it’s not anything likely to be terminal! We would appreciate, though, any prayers directed her way... their way, actually. Neither my mom or dad are Christians and... they need Him desperately. (Please don’t take that as a disparaging statement! They’re both hurting and He could help them so much!) So what I’m asking for is for God to reveal Himself to the two of them by healing my mom... and that He would do it in such a way that it couldn’t be credited to anyone or anything else. “Where two or three are gathered together in My name...” That’s the Scripture that keeps running through my head. Mom's name is Kathy and Dad's is Bill. Thank you for your patience and God bless you.

Boing???   Boing???   What is   wrong   with these people! Spam is all about quantity over quality. I tell you what, if those folks would just take a little longer to stop and think of better subject lines, they'd be raking in the... e-mail addresses. What kind of subject line is "Boing! The sound produced by a little pill!" From who? Bonita Williams. That's just wrong. Oh, I know I said I was done for the day, but I couldn't resist commentary on that spam. "Boing!" indeed.

I know, I promised something lovely and scintillating and... oh, wait, no, actually, I didn't. But that's ok. I was planning on it. But, quite honestly, I'm tired. I have two more, really good posts that I want to put up, but it'll probably have to wait until tomorrow because, right now, it's requiring more candle-power than I have to do the concepts justice. Mwah! That's all, folks!

One of my kids brought me an apple yesterday! Do you have any idea how excited I was about that? It means they think of me as a   REAL   teacher! Silly? Me? Obviously, you're unaware of the fact that Silly is my middle name! It was about the sweetest thing. Anna (the little girl who once asked me, "If God made everything, did He make Himself?") came up and tugged on my skirt (because, obviously, tugging on my clothing is the   very best   way to get my attention) and held the apple up for me. Initially, I thought she had brought it for her own snack. The kids do that occasionally. So I thanked her for bringing it to me so it wouldn't get lost and told her I'd give it to her at snack.  

She shook her head no, put her hands on her hips, and said, "Teacher! It's for   you!  " As if it was the most self-evident thing in the world and I must be terribly dense not to know that.   

"Oh, Anna! That's so sweet! Thank you for bringing the apple for me. It looks really good. I'm going to wait to eat it until I get home, though, because there's not enough to share with everyone, ok?"  

"Ok." She turns to go play, oblivious to the fact that I'm tearing up.  

Does that mean I'm a big kid now?

So, I've already  urlLink grumbled  about how I broke my toe. Sunday, the grandmother of one of my kids (a woman I'd never seen before) brought the little girl in. I noticed that Danielle (the girl) was kind of hanging back, which is something she does frequently; she's very shy. So to try to get her to come in, I asked if she could come be my big helper because I had a bad owie and needed helpers. She shook her head no, and I kind of shrugged. I hadn't thought it would work, but it was worth a shot. Then the grandmother finished signing her in and came into the room with Danielle. She'd had her right leg amputated just above the knee. Open mouth, insert foot. While we're at it, let's see if we can shove the other one in, too!  

She came all the way into the room, and one of the children asked her what had happened to her leg. She was so gracious about it, so matter-of-fact. "Well, sweetie, I had a very bad owie on my leg, and it was making me very sick. So we took it off and now I'm all better." The little girl who had asked said, "Ok," nodded as if she were completely satisfied by that, and turned back to play with the dolls. The awesome thing was that there was a complete sincerity in her voice and on her face as she said this. She 100% meant it when she said she was all better now. She was grateful to be alive and didn't   mind   that the cost had been one of her legs. Lord, help me find the grace to accept the trials--the picayune trials--You've given me with just a portion of this woman's faith. Thank You for the blessing of having met her, however briefly. Help me to hold this close to my heart, to realize how great Your blessings are, even if it seems, sometimes, as if they aren't.

I made lasagna all by myself for the first time on Saturday. Yes, yes, I did make it   after   I broke my toe and it   was  , in fact, the most intelligent thing I could have done.  

Anyway... It's amazing how much of my mom creeps into my cooking when I'm thinking about her... It didn't even occur to me to do anything other than make a big batch of spaghetti sauce (not entirely homemade, but much, much different than the way the jar of sauce started out!) before I started on the lasagna. Silly, I know. And yet... it made me feel closer to her, somehow. I wanted to call her and tell her all about it. The lasagna came out really well, actually. And I made it from the recipe in my head from watching Mom make hers. Oh, there were differences (for instance, lots and lots and lots of extra mushrooms), but... it was her recipe. I wanted to tell her that it was something Anthony really enjoyed. I wanted to tell her how amazed I was that, after all this time, with never having made it entirely by myself when I was still living there, that I made it and it came out beautifully. It's strange, sometimes, the things that catch me, stop me in mid-stride. Sometimes, it's the big things, like wanting her to be there for the wedding... but it seems like most of the time, it's these little things, the almost-silly stuff about being a newly-wed that I want so much to share with her... and can't. Partly because I'm too afraid to keep calling after so many rebuffs. Partly because she won't let me in. I miss her, an awful lot.

Sorry for the recent lack of posting. I broke my toe on Saturday and most of my thoughts since then have been focused more on trying not to swear each time I bump it or think about how I don't have time for this with trying to pack.  

But I have tons of ideas, I've started at least 5 posts, so there will soon be an excess of Tessa-ness rolling around this site. :) Just thought I'd forewarn you about absurd numbers of postings.  

And also thought I'd caution you that I, well, I know it's hard to believe, but, I'm a wee bit cranky about this all since, you know, I'm moving in about   two weeks   and I really don't have the time to ice and elevate my darn pinky toe! Must pack! Must plan! Must... sit on my butt and go nowhere so my foot doesn't throb like a thousand little demonic gnomes are using pick-axes on it. Yeah, let me tell you, driving into work was just   tons   of fun today!  

And please, please, don't tell me I'm being a baby about this. I know I am. I realize this. But telling me I'm being a baby about it is likely to get someone's head bitten off. And, since it's rather difficult to bite off one's   own   head, I think it's safe to assume that it wouldn't be mine. That's all for the moment. Yes, yes, there will indeed be better and more fascinating posts coming up. Promise. Thanks for letting me indulge in my pity-party.

Yes, yes, I am in fact jumping on the bandwagon. I liked  urlLink this idea  so much, I'm going to use it, too. Mostly so that I'm justified in asking  urlLink Kyra  the questions I wanted to, but it's very cool all the same. So, here's the deal (for those who didn't click on the links): Ask me any three questions (preferably profound or at least thought-provoking) and I will do my best to answer them completely. But, here's the catch: if you ask me three questions, you have to let anyone else do the same to you by posting this same information on your own site. Deal?

      Monday, Apr. 26, 2004 1:31 p.m.  

Yesterday a strange thing happened. One of the little boys (Matthew) in my Sunday school class hit another little boy (Daniel), which, in and of itself, is an extremely unusual occurrence. Throwing things? All the time. But hitting? Almost never. These kids just aren't   mean  . They're only three years old, and I would say most of them have good role models, people who have shown them appropriate ways to express frustration, or anger. Even when they throw things, it's normally because they just like to watch them go flying, not because they're trying to hit someone else. Don't get me wrong; they're far from being angels. They're mischievous and often cranky, but they're not   mean  . So hitting is extremely rare. But the strange thing was, I found myself choosing a course of action that... I wasn't sure about. I don't have any kids (yet), but one thing I   do   know is that consistency is extremely important, especially with young children. Aside from that, as a Christian, it's important to me that I stick to my word and that the rules be the same for all the kids (to a reasonable extent; it's not like I don't make exceptions or compromises!) all the time so that they have some sort of example of a consistent, appropriate behavior before God.  (Ok, getting massively side-tracked. Back to what I wanted to write about.)   

When I became aware of Matthew hitting Daniel, I went over, brought the two boys close to me, and asked Matthew to apologize.  (After making sure Daniel was ok.)  Matthew just shook his head no, refusing to say anything in spite of several requests. So Matthew and I went over to sit in a corner while I tried to get him to talk to me and explain why he didn't want to apologize. Nothing forthcoming, nothing at all. Except for him squirming off my lap and crying against the wall. After about a minute and a half, I called Daniel over and asked Matthew to apologize to him again. Nada. I placed my hands on either side of Matthew's face to get him to look at me but(hopefully) not make him feel trapped. He just shook his head no again, started crying, and turned his face back to the wall. Unfortunately, as a teacher (with 17 kids for the day), I also have a responsibility to the rest of the class room. So I went ahead and let him cry (kept an eye on him) and he joined back in playing before too long, and didn't hit anyone else.   

Here's the thing that somewhat disturbed me. My instinct was to sit there with him alternating between time out and giving him the opportunity to apologize until he finally did apologize. Matthew, though, is a   very   stubborn little boy, and it's entirely possible that we'd have been there for an extended period of time. Extremely extended. This is the first time I've felt like my initial instinct was more to dominate rather than correct.  

I don't know if that makes sense or not. There are a lot of things my parents did when I was younger of which I heartily approve. If I tried to wander out into the street after specifically being instructed not to, well, I got a swat on the butt. (And, as I got older, I got grounded from books because   that   was far more effective than a spanking since it was over and done with quickly.) My parents   were   consistent. I knew, without doubt, that if I talked back to my parents or deliberately disobeyed them, that there would be consequences. And I also knew that if I lied, whatever punishment would be much worse   because   I lied than it would have been if I'd just 'fessed up. And I knew that there would be consistent, reasonable consequences that didn't change from event to event. Yes, my parents were stricter than my friends' parents, but I at least knew what was right or wrong in my parents' eyes. When I was nine, we moved in with Larry (that's a story for another time; I won't launch into it for now) and things changed. I wasn't sure which things were breaking the rules and which weren't. I got punished as often or as badly for an honest mistake as deliberate defiance. There wasn't rhyme or reason to it--or at least not a rhyme or reason I could decipher at the time. Later, when I started getting out from under that household, I could see what it was all about: dominance. Not knowing what the rules were was a way of keeping me off balance, and, consequently, more malleable. Not knowing what the consequences would be was a way of making me fearful, and, consequently, more subservient. Everything about that was a way to have absolute and total control over me. I had enough time   before   that to have the right sorts of instincts and reactions ingrained. And 99% of the time, I have no doubts about how I treat children, how I react to them... It's just that 1% of the time, when I can't precisely pin down my own motives... and especially in this case where letting Matthew be worked so much better than trying to force the issue had. It's just a little scary. There are a lot of things that God pruned out of me, little vicious tendencies, passive-aggressive behaviors, being defiant and not letting people close because it would, inevitably, lead to them trying to dominate me... all those weeds were pulled out. I firmly believe that. It doesn't mean, though, that my instincts are infallible, or that there aren't still some ugly parts that I don't like to face or admit are there.  

You know, it's funny, but I feel like I just stumbled across the reason I'm so uncomfortable with the thought of raising children once they get past a certain age... and that's because I don't feel like I've got any sort of appropriate behavior to model my own on after that point. The ghosts of old demons... Except I have a transcendent example, really. I have my relationship with God, and I have, if not a perfect, at least a working understanding of what He wants and approves. So I guess I'm getting there... just with a few bumps along the road.

It's weird, but somehow, deciding to get a haircut tonight also motivated me to go work out. :) My friend  urlLink Ilsa  calls it the "reverse Samson" effect. That made me smile. But it seems like it does make a difference somehow, and it's nice to know that it's not just me! :) Um... yes, that   did   in fact deserve an entry all it's own. I'm working on two very deep, very philosophical posts, so cut me some slack! :)

There is a difference between living   in   grace and living   by   grace...   

As an example... If I know that, when this boat sinks, my life-jacket will keep me safe  (not that I particularly care for comparing God to a life-jacket, mind you) , I'm going to be moving around on the boat a lot more confidently, even though I know, eventually, it   will   sink.  

On the other hand, if I go around, throwing myself into the water time and again, trusting that the life-jacket will bail me out...  (Yes, I am, perhaps a little too find of elipses.)  Well, then there are a couple of consequences. One is that I abuse a gift, a very precious gift, that I've been given by using it for purposes never intended. The other is that abusing that gift doesn't bring me any nearer to the person who gave it.  

That, in case it was too absurdly oblique to make any sense, was a reference to God's grace and Jesus' sacrifice for us on the cross. Last night we were talking about how being forgiven our sins didn't give us the right to go around continuing to sin, that it's not business as usual, but, oh, cool, there's no penalty. Dude, thanks J-man. And I see far too many people going around with that mentality. One of the things I love about  urlLink my church   (Whoa! Massive changes to the website. It looks marvelous!)  is that I've found the fewest number of Christians with that attitude here. Anyway, that's all for now...   

 (Actually, this isn't really a non sequitur, but I don't have time just yet to finish with the rest of what I want to write just now. And without that, it seems totally unconnected to anything.)

Hey Baby,  

I was thinking, earlier today, about how I started falling in love with you right about the same time I was coming to know God. I couldn't help but wonder why He arranged it that way. I mean, He could have set it up in a much easier fashion... you know, one at a time, which would have been infinitely easier to cope with. Instead, I found myself falling in love with you and God at the same time--which was, to say the least, a wee bit confusing. The more I thought about it today, though, the more I realized that, without falling in love with you, I couldn't possibly have loved God. Not to mention that without God loving me, I couldn't have known how to love you.  

That sounds like such a strange thing to say, but it's so very true. I mean... what experience did I have with love up to that point? The only things I knew were: 
 You only get love if you perform and behave properly. 
 The people who love you want something from you. 
 Love can easily be rescinded... or at the very least not shown. 
 There is no such thing as "true love". 
 You can't count on love or on other people loving you for long. 
 The people who love you are the most likely to hurt you and expose you to others. 
 It's not safe to show other people,   not anyone  , that you love someone because, guaranteed, someone will use it against you. 
 Loving friends is marginally safer than loving family because at least you can choose friends. And then it's your own fault when they hurt you. 
 Men are not to be trusted because they won't stand up for you or they'll betray you or they'll hurt you (or any combination of the above).   

That's why I got so angry, fought so hard when I felt myself falling in love with you. I knew it wasn't safe. I was positive that you would just hurt me... not to mention that, at that point, I had no intention of staying in California. And that, quite obviously, I wasn't a Christian so you had no intention of allowing us to start a relationship beyond being friends. So even if, by some miracle, none of the things on the list above happened or applied to you, I would still be hurt because I was going to leave. I almost wonder if God didn't use my distraction with you to kind of creep in unnoticed where I would have fought Him so much harder otherwise. But, without starting to feel safe in loving you, because you   didn't   do those things (although that terrified me on a completely different level, waiting for the shoe to drop), I couldn't have comprehended that God could love me without any conditions, without strings attached... and that He wouldn't abandon me. Because, when it comes right down to it,   that's   the piece that I really couldn't grasp.  

I just wanted to thank you, for being so patient with me, for loving me, for being so persistent in pointing me toward God. I know I get cranky and irritated and defensive sometimes (often) when you call me on the ways I'm not living up to what God has planned. Please don't stop doing that because you're   right  ... or at least, if you're not, I ought to be able to explain it! I love you, and I treasure your closeness to God and your willingness to see Him in all things. Sometimes (often) I don't tell you, don't show you how very much I appreciate you. I just wanted to make sure you know.  

Love, 
Me.

Oooh! I just followed a banner to  urlLink This Journey is My Own  and, for whatever reason clicked on his  urlLink survey  (which is not something I normally do) and it was an awful lot of fun. You should head over there. :) Really. In case you were wondering,  urlLink these are my responses . Go on, go look.

So... I sent  urlLink that letter  to Alicia the same day I wrote it, but I haven't heard anything back. I don't know if I will. I guess I was being a little overly optimistic in expecting some sort of quick response... It's very disappointing. And, to tell the truth, it kind of hurts. I'm relatively sure she checks her e-mail daily. But, for all I know, she's gotten swamped with work and school  (she should be graduating soon! The only one in our group who had no intention of going to college if she could at all avoid it and she's going to be the first to get a degree. How ironic is  that !)  or life in general and just hasn't gotten it yet. Patience has never been one of my virtues. I guess I'll just wait and see.

Note to self: in the future, tirades about (or directed to) incompetent apartment managers and infuriating Kinko's employees should be postponed for a minimum of 24 hours while coping with intense menstrual cramps and hormonal swings resulting from fussing with birth control pills. Please take due note of this information for future reference and more pleasant relations.  

After having read the  urlLink previous  (somewhat vitriolic) post, I realized that a good deal of my frustration may be chemically induced. Sorry, folks...

Well,   that   was certainly... refreshing. Not really, of course, but it's a lot harder to convey sarcasm in writing than it is with my tone of voice and facial expressions. Seeing as how you're not able to see my face or hear my voice...  

I just got back from a meeting with the manager of my apartment complex. It was less than informative and more than aggravating.  

Backtrack: about a week and a half ago, I informed the infuriatingly incompetent apartment manager (henceforth known as the IIAM) that Anthony and I would be moving out, but that we didn't want to move by April 30th (when the lease is up) but about two weeks later, around May 15th due to various circumstances.  

 
Me: Will you offer a prorated rent for the two weeks we're off lease?  (Am I mistaken, or is this a relatively simple, straightforward question?)   

IIAM: Why are you moving?  

Me: There's not enough room. It's too noisy with the new tenants a few doors down from us.  (Thought, not spoken: "I don't trust you. You've been marginally dishonest with us and exceedingly uninformative in all past interactions. I have no desire to continue living in a location that requires me to place any modicum of trust in your abilities.")   

IIAM: Well, we also manage another set of apartments nearby. They're much, much bigger, and the tenants are all really quiet.  

Me: That's certainly something we can consider. So, if that doesn't work out, will you be offering a prorated rent for the two weeks or will we have to move out when the lease ends?  

IIAM: Oh, you don't have to worry about the lease if you move over to this other place. Since it's all owned by the same company, there wouldn't be any problem. You wouldn't have to worry about when your lease is up. You could move before that, no problem.  

Me  (getting increasingly frustrated) : No, see, our lease is up at the end of   this   month, April 30th, and we don't want to move until two weeks   after   that, around May 15th. I'm trying to find out what our options are. I know we can go month-to-month at the end of the lease for at least a month, but we don't want to stay for the entire month. Do you offer a prorated rent for the time we would actually be in the apartment?  

IIAM: Oh, oh, no, that's not a problem. If you move into this other complex, we'll just renew your lease and it will be applied to the new location. No problems at all. So, do you want to see the other apartment? It's just a little distance from here.  

Me  (mentally throwing up my hands in defeat) : Sure. Let's go look at it.  

[Insert brief tour of marginally larger apartment. Note that neighbors at 3:30 in the afternoon on a weekday are blaring the radio and being generally quite loud.]  

IIAM: So, do you want the apartment? There's another couple interested in it, but I told them, if they didn't sign the papers today, that it's on a first come, first served basis. So, if you sign the paperwork today, then, it's all settled. It's all yours.  

Me: Well, I'm a little concerned about the amount of noise from the neighbors. I'm also concerned about the parking situation and the fact that the laundry room is pretty minimal for how many people are in this complex. [Insert longer list of reasons I don't think this apartment will work.]  

IIAM: Well, just go ahead and think about it. Maybe you could bring your husband here and he could take a look later tonight?  

Me: That's a possibility. He should be home relatively soon. We could come back and take a look at that point.  If this doesn't work out, though,  what about the two weeks' difference in time?  

IIAM: Well, if Anthony does come back to look at it tonight, that would be very good. Then you could fill out the paperwork and start moving over right away.  

Me  (supressing the urge to simultaneously scream and throttle IIAM) : Why don't we go back to the other apartments. I need to check on my laundry.  

IIAM  (nodding and beaming cheerfully) : Sure, sure, no problem.   

Mercifully, she finally answered my question  (albeit resentfully)  when we got back to the apartment complex and told me that we would be offered a prorated rent for the two weeks. She still, however, refused to give me any definite numbers. I find this somewhat alarming as the rent is supposed to increase by $100 when a lease goes over to month-to-month. I will be very surprised if the prorated amount doesn't end up reflecting that. She also made the statment that we'd be charged for cleaning the apartment. When asked about this, she explained that they hire a cleaning company to come in after each apartment is vacated and that the tenant is charged for that. Excuse me? Sorry, but that's   standard practice   for   ALL   apartment complexes. You have   no right   to charge me for standard cleaning that you have to do after I vacate. If I leave the place in an awful mess, or if I've damaged something that needs to be fixed, ok, fine, I won't argue with you. But you have no right to charge me for a cleaning service you will hire regardless of how well I clean when I move out. When I started trying to debate this with her, she fell back on her favorite line: "Well, that's what the Spieker Company insists on. I have no say in it, I just go through and say whether or not I think it's clean." Anyway... 
  

Fast forward to today  (ironically enough, working on laundry again) . After passing by the office on my way to the laundry room and determining that there wasn't anyone in there, I headed back to our apartment. Sitting in the living room beginning to pack, my favorite IIAM comes to knock on the door.   

 
IIAM: Excuse me, did you want that other apartment?  

Me  (gaping in disbelief) : Um, no...  

IIAM: Because I have a lot of people who want to rent it and I need to know if you're planning on moving in there.  

Me: No, no, definitely not. We found a better place.  

IIAM: But this one is only $$$ and there's the move-in special.  

Me: You mean the move-in special you told me we didn't qualify for because we're current tenants and not new tenants? Besides we found one for $ less than that one, and it's much, much bigger. Plus it has two heated pools in the complex, it's a gated community, they have--  

IIAM  (hurriedly interrupting) : Well, I just wanted to make sure you didn't want it.  

Me: No, this place has much larger laundry facilities and a workout room. It's also got a dining room and a nice, big linen cabinet. They also have--  

IIAM  (interrupting and looking massively irritated) : Well, that's nice. I was just checking. You need to fill out the paperwork, then. You'll be gone by May 1st, right?  

Me: Um, no. We talked about this previously. We weren't going to leave until around the 15th, but, since I haven't given my 30 day notice yet, it will probably have to be the 20th of May. You were going to give us a call about the prorated rent for those few weeks. Remember?  

IIAM: Well, you need to come fill out the paperwork.  

Me  (shaking my head) : Ok. I'll be over in the next 20 minutes or so when my next load of laundry is ready to go into the dryer.   

What the   hell   is wrong with her??? ERK!!! Actually, on second thought, I don't think she's infuriatingly incompetent, I think she's maliciously misleading. (And no, I didn't try for the alliteration, it just happened.) However, I don't know if I want to give her the title of MMAM as that looks/sounds almost maternal, which she most definitely is   not.   I seriously can't stand this woman. She's driving me bonkers. The more I deal with her, the happier I am that Anthony's had most of the interaction with her in the past. For whatever reason, she doesn't seem to drive him up the wall the way she does me. Just typing this up makes me want to shake something. Or better yet,   throw   something. Ok, I need to head out now... thanks for listening to the little rant. Just wait until I tell you about the folks at Kinko's, whose services I will   NEVER, EVER   be using again. I know, I can tell you're waiting with bated breath!

Hey Leesh,  

I was thinking yesterday, about our friendship, about how far apart we've drifted, how different we've become... how little we have in common anymore. There were so many things we shared, experiences and ideas, pain and anger, hopes and dreams, and now... now there's just this grey  nothing . There wasn't any big blow up, no screaming, ranting fight. No one would have believed it; after all the noisy battles, shouting each other down in the cafeteria, sparring on the lawn, debating absurd points in History... after all of that, here we are somehow just drifting farther and farther away from each other. The truth is, if I'd really stopped to think about it, our friendship   couldn't   end that way, couldn't possibly go out with a brawl... because we know how to deal with that. We know when to give each other just enough space to cool down and when to wade in and duke it out. Or at least... we knew how to do that. Now, though... now I barely know you, barely hear your dreams or your plans, barely understand the life you're living anymore. And I hear the confusion in your voice when I try to explain why I'm so happy being who I am now, that I don't have the least desire to go back to being who I was. She was strong, yes, on the outside at least... and maybe she wasn't as vulnerable... but I got   so tired   of building up those walls, thicker and thicker, higher and higher... until I wasn't sure how to let my friends in, or even if I still could, if anyone knew "the   real   me" because   I didn't know that person,   I didn't know who I was or what I wanted (other than to get as far away from everything that hurt as possible). My dreams of going to the moon... that was nothing more than running away. Oh, I'm still very much interested in the research, but I hear the disappointment in your voice when I tell you that because you feel like I've given up on my dreams for   him  . And I don't know how to make you understand that it's not that way at all. I don't know how to explain to you that I don't   need   to run away anymore. And all the things we liked so much about each other, our determination, stubborn pride, the fierce loyalty, and all the things we had in common, somehow that's all just slipped away, drowned somewhere in the greyness our friendship has become. The funny thing is, one of the things we both loved so much about each other was the determination   not   to take the easy way out. Our worst fights were because of the times I did... the time I went back to my parents even though you were willing to shelter me. At the time, I didn't know how to let you do it, I didn't know how to tell my heart it was ok to let go, to trust you, to know that you wouldn't let them get to me, not ever. And even if I'd found the words, I think they would have hurt you worse at the time than I did by rolling over and going back home when they came to get me. But that's not the point I was trying to make; the point is, I'm not sure what to do now. It would be so easy to just let our friendship keep drifting away, to put off calling you for another couple days or wait to respond to that e-mail because I'm just too busy to do it right now. But we haven't often taken the easy way out... and I don't think I want to start now. I miss the friendship we had. I miss being able to talk to you, to hear you excited about something, anything, to know what's going on in your life. I miss being able to share things with you. Even though it's going to take a lot of work, I just... I just wanted to tell you, I still love you. We've been through too much together to let our friendship go like this. So, whaddaya say?  

Love, 
Me.

Oh! Oh! It was so exciting!  urlLink It launched!  Anthony worked as a systems engineer for  urlLink Gravity Probe B  for about a year and a half. Something my husband touched is currently in space, orbiting our planet   right now  ! Do you know how insanely cool that is???? At least it is to me! So we drove down to Vandenberg on Sunday and we went out to one of the viewing sites on Monday. The launch was scrubbed  (evidently due to upper-level wind speeds alternating between green and red too rapidly to make it safe to launch--or at least that's my non-technical understanding of the explanation)  on that date, but Anthony explained that with a one-second launch window  (one second! How crazy is that??) , that there was only a 30% probability of it launching on the first try. Somewhat higher for GPB since they've been working on it for so long. So we stayed the second day, hoping it would launch. If it hadn't, we'd have come back home without being able to see anything. But, fortunately for us, it   did   launch on Tuesday.  

The funny thing is that when we planned on going down there, I was mostly going for Anthony  (well, and who wouldn't want to play hooky from work for two days?)  because he was so excited about it. I wasn't terribly disappointed when the launch was scrubbed, felt bad for Anthony, but other than that... And then the next day, there were so few people compared to the first day. I almost thought we might as well just turn around and go back  (except that the buses that carted us out weren't going back yet)  because (in my perfectly logical and rational mind) since there were so few people today, there must be an even poorer chance of it launching. But we stayed and we watched the TV's they had set up with all kinds of information and live feeds into the control room  (which, I have to admit, was immensely cool)  and then as it got closer and closer, we kept hearing higher and higher probability numbers about the launch going up. So we headed over to an area Anthony thought would be good for viewing and waited for the countdown. We heard the announcer saying, "Liftoff", but because we were far enough away (and behind a ridge) from the launch site, we couldn't see the rocket at first. My initial thought was that something had gone wrong and all those years of hard work had just gone up, literally, in smoke. But moments later we saw it rising up and I actually Whoooo!ed out loud. I know, I know, shameful. And a few seconds later, we felt a slight percussion  (we were, after all, 7 miles away)  and then the noise hit us. It seemed almost unreal. It was vastly exciting and I've spent the day telling anyone who will listen about how marvelously cool it is.

Oh, I am so productive today! I was going to write yesterday  (well, whine, really)  about the weekend. Or Easter, rather, since Saturday was quite pleasant. And I probably will because I am   still   ticked off at John  (introductions to be completed later)  and I don't usually stay mad for 2 days running. Instead, though, I'm going to talk about all the exciting information I found out today. See, I've been planning on going back to school "soon" for the last... oh, three years. At first, I was waiting because I needed to get my California residency. And then, well, I didn't have the money. And then, I tried going for just one class and managed to screw up on my admissions and registration so that I never actually was technically registered for the class so, midway through, I just left since I wouldn't be getting any credit for it anyway. Then the second time, I tried to take the same class but just couldn't summon up much enthusiasm because I'd already done quite a lot of the things we were going over. Not to mention that I was stressed out because of work. Not that, on some level, at least, those aren't all valid reasons not to go back to school... it's just that they weren't the   real   reasons. The real reasons are that 1) I'm terrified I'll fail like I did in Colorado, even though the circumstances are wildly different; and 2) I have changed so much in the last 4 years since I went to  urlLink Colorado State  for my Freshman year of college, that I'm not even sure where to begin. There are so many choices to make, so many possibilities I'd never considered...  

But anyway, I looked online and found the appropriate phone numbers. I found out that I need to talk to someone in the enrollment office, and that it's on a walk-in basis. So I've scheduled myself (on MY calendar at least) to go in on the 22nd, which is a week from Thursday. It's frightening and exciting all at the same time. The options I'm looking at are:  

1)  urlLink Child and Adolescent Development  in the Education Department at  urlLink San Jose State . Since teaching preschool or grade school children is something I've been looking at more and more since I've gotten so involved with the 3 year olds at my church, this is looking like a very appealing option.  

2)  urlLink Molecular Biology   (also at  urlLink San Jose State )  with an emphasis in Genetics.  

3)  urlLink BA - Natural Science, Preparation for Teaching (preparation for elementary school teaching)  which would roll the two together but might not qualify me to teach generally, only specifically.  

4) The possibility of combining any of the 3 above and having a double major. At this point, the most likely double major will be with Molecular Biology and Child and Adolescent Development... which, incidentally will also probably have the least amount of overlap.  

I don't mind, though. I'm so excited! I was previously pretty depressed about the fact that I missed the deadline for general admissions by about a month and a half. For whatever reason, I was sure it was the end of March, but it turned out to be February 2nd! Here, I thought I was being good by getting to it in mid-March rather than a day or two before which is my normal mode of operation. Only to find out... I was   so very   wrong. Anyway, the people I talked to today told me that the individual departments (colleges?) sometimes have different deadlines for admissions and that there's a possibility I might get around the earlier deadline by applying directly to, say, the department of Biological Sciences instead. Which is very exciting. Even if that won't work (and I'm prepared to accept that it may not since it's already mid-April and I've probably passed most deadlines anyway) I will be talking to a real, live person next week! They'll help me figure things out, and, it's entirely possible that they may let me register for the Spring semester, now. Which would be awesome since I can't yet do that online.  

All of that babbling is simply to say that I'm insanely excited about how near to going back to school I am after all this time! :) Mwah! That's it for now.

And really, the only reason I'm mentioning it (aside from an obvious ploy for sympathy) is so that I've got it written down somewhere because I have been getting sick   soooo   often lately, it's not even funny... Mostly I'm trying to see if there's a pattern of some sort. So, yeah, feel free to pass right on by this...

Last night I was freezing.  (Oh, shut up! Yes, I  am  from Colorado, and yes, I  am  complaining about cold weather here in California. I think I'm getting sick, ok? Gimme a break!)  Anyway, as I was saying, last night I was freezing and pulled an extra blanket over me... which is the quilt my mom made for me. It usually covers the bottom of the bed, looks pretty, and is there for when a) I steal all the covers from Anthony, b) he steals all the covers from me, or c) it gets really cold.  (I said shush.)   

But last night, it got me to thinking about Mom and how much I miss her... and how much I wish she would talk to me. I thought about writing her again, asking her why she and Larry wouldn't accept the apology letter... debating about telling her I knew they opened it... asking her why they didn't tell Dad... just generally composing a letter to her in my head. Unfortunately, I was tired and lazy and didn't get up to write any of it out so... it's all gone this morning. Just a vague memory of what I was thinking about, none of the words, none of the phrases that came together so well in my thoughts... which, come to think of it, may be just as well, given that I tend to think I have brilliant ideas just before I go to sleep, but when I wake up, they don't seem quite so coherent or scintillating... :)

So,  urlLink this song  is about half of the inspiration for the title of this site.   

About a month ago... maybe a little more, one of our pastors spoke about God giving us a name.  (If you're interested, you can probably look  urlLink here  to find it. It doesn't look like it's posted just yet.)  He talked about how we all have past hurts and that pretty much everyone has allowed those events to be labels in how they think of themselves. A girl teased as a teenager about her clothing or appearance often thinks of herself as ugly in later life... That sort of thing. And he pointed out that God doesn't see us that way, that God has entirely different labels for us... ones that build up instead of tear down. Which may sound like a terribly generic message--after all, most of us know on some basic level that God loves us. Which, in turn, means that he doesn't say nasty things about us behind our backs. At the same time, Mike's comments really made me think about how often I   do   let myself be defined by the labels I apply or others apply... and how that limits God. Mike asked us to pray about it  (imagine that! Praying, right there in church!) , saying that he thought God had a new name for each person. So I prayed, and I thought God was telling me that he had called me Chosen. Except I wasn't sure.  (I'd have gotten along swell with Thomas--you know, doubting Thomas.)  So I decided to keep praying about it. Except that my prayer life hasn't exactly been exemplary and, when I did remember to pray, I very rarely remembered to ask about being re-named. Until...  

...one night at Alpha-Link.  (I'm in this program at my church called  urlLink Alpha ... and Alpha-Link is something my church has put together as a follow-on. Each week, we have pastors and elders come to do the teaching on their favorite topics. Which is awesome because they're almost always passionate about it.)  A couple weeks ago, the topic was prayer. And some of the things the speaker (Wanda) was saying just really hit home... essentially about how most people, after some initial trepidation, don't need much help or prompting in the speaking part of prayer... but that most of us are terrible about listening. So her talk was focused more on practical ways to listen to God. I felt God nudging me throughout her talk as various points came up, and realized there were a lot of things I could do to make myself open to listening to Him... and that it wasn't being unbelieving (necessarily) to ask Him to confirm what I thought He was saying, essentially, that it was ok to ask Him to clarify so that I know it's not my own wandering mind supplying "answers" rather than Him. At the end of Wanda's talk, she, too, invited us to pray. Hmmm... there's a lot more to this, but I think for right now, I'll just address the portion about the name of this blog. When I started praying, the thing that popped into my mind was  urlLink that song ... specifically half of the chorus line, starting with "You have called me chosen..." Except that it was in the opposite form: "I have called you chosen, for my kingdom, unashamed to call you my own. You are my beloved." Which seemed like pretty concrete confirmation to me. Especially since we haven't sung that song at church in... oh, at least three months, probably more like six... so it's not like we'd just heard it recently for it to pop into my mind like that. Taking that in context with me having been abused  (I'm sure I'll go into that more at some point) , the whole reason I started this blog is to try to work out the kinks between the left-over habits and thought-patterns and how far God's brought me...

Lord, it was You who 
Created the heavens. 
Lord, it was Your hand 
That put the stars in their place. 
Lord, it is Your voice 
That commands the morning. 
Even oceans and their waves 
Bow at your feet.  

 Lord, who am I 
Compared to Your glory? 
Lord, who am I 
Compared to Your majesty? 
I am Your beloved, 
Your creation, 
And You love me as I am. 
You have called me chosen, 
For Your kingdom, 
Unashamed to call me Your own. 
I am Your beloved.

So, Anthony (my husband) and I will be moving in the next month or so. It's the first time I've voluntarily moved since I came out here from Colorado. It feels weird. All the other moves were because of circumstances, conflicts with the people who lived where I did or... well, actually, that about sums it up neatly. It's always been either me being forced to move by someone else, or me feeling forced to move because I couldn't take staying with that person. Then I moved here and it was my first place that I had all to myself. No roommates, or house-mates, just me, blissfully alone whenever I wanted to be, taking hour-long baths or reading or wandering around in pajamas. And I did so much growing... so much exploring... so much finding myself, finding my way closer to God, letting myself trust Him more... and this was the place where I got ready for our wedding just last August, where all of my closest high-school friends and family came to stay to help me get ready, to talk, and just to treasure the last bit of time before my whole world changed... and then, this was our first apartment together, the place we came home to after the honeymoon, the refuge from everyone wanting to know what was going on, the place where we could just spend time with each other.  

Oh, I know, objectively, it's a terrible little apartment, especially with the rent as high as it is here compared to the area... it has no storage, and it's tiny, and the area isn't very nice, and there are strange people living in the apartment complex. The walls are ridiculously thin, the kitchen is hopelessly arranged, the bedroom is tiny, the bathroom doesn't have any cupboards, the shower and tub have been in there since 1960's... I know all of that, and it's why we're going to get a new place... it's just that I feel as if I'm leaving so much behind... as if, somehow, this apartment, and this complex has taken on a part of me, is alive in some way, and I feel as if I'm abandoning a dear friend... And at the same time, I'm incredibly excited about the new adventures, the next steps along God's path that are coming.

      This is a repeat of my main place to post at  urlLink Diaryland , which is  urlLink this  site. I really like a lot of the blogger features... such as the little e-mail to post bit. I'm also looking at shifting my main site over here, possibly along with selected items from my other  urlLink D-land  site which I shut down because... well, as a  urlLink friend of mine  put it, because my husband and my diary didn't get along. :) Honestly, I started writing at that site a very long time ago and we (my now-husband and I) had some really serious issues to work out. I needed, at the time, a place to vent and say the awful, hurtful things that I would never want to actually say   to   him. If that makes any sense. But, if I may say so myself, I did some beautiful writing there. So I'll probably pull in the ones that I'm most pleased about from there. So it's going to look like I did an insane amount of posting all at once. Really, though, these are all old posts... Well, you know, except for this one, obviously... :)

           Well, it’s taken me a month to get this finally finished up. I just want you to know, this is straight from the heart. It took so long because it’s awful damn hard to take down all the walls after everything that’s happened between us. It took me a long time to write the first response to your e-mail, because I wasn’t sure quite what I wanted to say. I ended up writing some foo-foo response, saying, hey, that’s great, I guess we’ll just need to work on our friendship. I felt like, if I responded honestly to what you wrote, that we wouldn’t have a friendship. But I don’t want some stupid, superficial friendship anyway. If we’re going to get back to a point where we can really be friends, it’s going to take brutal honesty on both of our parts. It’s also probably why I didn’t save it anywhere because it wasn’t really me and it wasn’t something I wanted to hold onto. So this one is taking much longer than the other to write. Partly because a lot of this hurts to talk about, and partly because it’s really hard to be totally open with you after so long. Some naive part of me expected a "Sure, hey, that'd be great" response from you. I'm not sure why. It's not you. It's not me, either. I guess I just wanted this whole big mess to be... cleaned up... neat and tidy, without all the hurt that comes along with really fixing something this huge. I guess I just want you to know that nothing I’ve written here is intended to be hurtful. I know a lot if it won’t be easy to read, but you went out on a limb and you were open with me, so… Anyway, onto what you said.                You wrote:             Tessa, for what it is worth I was thinking along the same lines a few days ago after watching the ya-ya sisterhood. However I was not sure how to bring it u[ or if it was even worth it.                Do you have any idea how mad that statement makes me? That’s the way things   always   are with us. If I don't call, don't apologize, don't make the effort to mend our relationship, then   nothing   happens. Ever. BECAUSE. YOU. DON'T. FIX. IT. It's always been me, in all the time in our relationship, there hasn't been once,   not one single time   that you have apologized first. And I can count on one hand the number of times you’ve apologized to me ever. I mean, it's not like we haven't had our share of fights! We've gone round and round. But it always has to be me who initiates any kind of reconciliation. That's not fair. And if we’re going to have a friendship, it needs to be something that stops.                           However it is out there so the least I owe you is to be honest with you as well as myself. We have faded into this grayness because we gave up on each other. The time I needed someone the most you left me hanging. I don't care what your reasons are for doing that it is all ready done.                Ok, let’s get it out in the open. You mention him so many times without actually saying his name in this letter, it’s insane. Joseph. Now, do you realize how unfair your statement is? First you accuse me of letting you down, not being there when you needed me, but then don't give me any chance at all to refute your statement or explain what was going on or remind you of my side of it. Not to mention that you leave me no opportunity to tell you that you let me down, too. You know what? We   both   hurt after Joseph's death. I know you felt guilty. I know you had to be there at the moment of the accident. I know that you had so many other things going on with you at that moment. But you know what? You are not the only one! We all hurt. And at his funeral, you screamed at me to shut up when I was singing. That was the only way I had right then to express how much I felt, the grief, the hurt, the guilt, the sorrow, the loss… And I think you knew that. After we had that blow-out fight, I wanted, just one time in our friendship, to know that I meant enough to you that you would come to me and apologize. Just once. That’s all I was asking. I   didn’t do anything wrong   that day. So you’re right, I “left you hanging” when you needed me the most. But I needed you, too, and you weren’t there for me, either. Your pride was more important to you than our friendship, and every time I would go to pick up the phone, to make that call, all I could think was, “I’m not even important enough for her to apologize for hurting me worse. She thinks I’m an embarrassment.” And I couldn’t do it. I needed some reassurance that you valued our friendship, even just a little. And the longer it went without you calling me, the more I felt like our entire friendship was a lie because I didn’t matter to you. I know that I let my pride and my need for reassurance get in the way of our friendship. And I shouldn’t have done that. We both needed each other right then, and we were too wrapped up in our own grief to recognize that. But I can’t go back and change that. I can’t say, like I always used to, that I take all the responsibility for it, though either. I understand that you were hurting, and I know that I never   can   know just how badly you were wounded by his death. Friendships are all about give and take; I don’t think either one of us had anything left to give at that point. It makes me so mad that you wrote “I don’t care what your reasons are for doing that it is already done.” As if I’m not allowed to comment on it from there, as if I just have to accept your statement and leave it at that. I am not the same girl I was 5 years ago. That girl would have swallowed it and said ok. She would’ve been hurt deep inside and not said anything about it because it might jeopardize our friendship. Me? I need to call you on that behavior because for us to have a friendship, that isn’t ok, either.             However I seen it as a convenient time for you to go ahead and walk something you where all reading intending to do. Because to be honest we where not talking or hanging together before that. Your choice you had made new friends that I never meet.                Now, is this what you honestly think, or were you just trying to wound me? You’re right, we weren’t talking or hanging out much anymore once I went to college. Definitely not by the end of second semester. You say it was my choice that you never met my new friends. Well, maybe that’s true, but it wasn’t for lack of trying. Remember the bowling alley? Remember when I tried to introduce you to a couple of the people I was hanging out with? You couldn’t stand them. You made rude remarks and it damn near turned into a brawl! You made snap judgments and didn’t give them a chance. Why would I try to introduce you to anyone else? You’d already made your mind up. Not to mention that Justin and company went back and complained about how you treated them, so they weren’t likely to take well to you after that. I figured I just had to keep my friends separate. I remember being so frustrated with you, that you would almost never come up to the dorms anymore, that I always had to drive all the way out to see you. There’s another example of a time when I stopped trying so hard because I didn’t have any more to give. Instead of reaching for me, you just let me go. So when we had that big blow-up fight at Joseph’s funeral, and I walked away, I was hoping I meant enough to you that you wouldn’t just let me go that time. It wasn’t a matter of convenience; it wasn’t a matter of me choosing them over you. At that point, it was the simple fact that I had nothing more to give and I needed someone who could give to me and not just take. I know you didn’t like them, but Justin and Mary and Aaron and Luis… all of them   were   able to give to me and support me at that point. And looking back now, I can’t blame you for not having any more to give either. We were both at the end of our ropes and I was so immersed in what I was going through at the time that I couldn’t see that, couldn’t make any allowances for it.                Anyways when we did start talking you were always to busy for me. To busy to email or write letters or to even read the letters that I sent to you so I quite seeing the point. It felt like a one way road that I had already been done time and time again and always ended up in a place I didn't want to be.              You are 100% right about that. I didn’t make time for you when we started talking again. Probably because, on some level, I wanted to see how committed you were to fixing our relationship. I finally thought about how stupid all the pride and wasted   years   were, and called you up again. But I still wanted reassurance that I was important and that you were willing to reach out to me and not just let me go again. That wasn’t fair to you. I didn’t respond to the letters, and something did always come up so that I didn’t e-mail or write back. And that’s something I am very sorry for. I know sorry doesn’t fix it, but it’s always been a starting place for us. And I can definitely understand not wanting to end up going down that road.               As for phone calls the calls it seemed you never had anything to say when you could but probably called out of guilt. I had to do all the talking just to have that time with you.                I didn’t realize that’s how you felt about it. I didn’t call out of guilt. I called because I wanted to know what was going on with you. I wanted to hear about your life and your plans and your thoughts. I didn’t ever say much of anything because the people, the things that were the most important to me, you didn’t want to hear anything about. If things were going well with Anthony, you didn’t really want to talk about it. If I wanted to try to talk to you about my relationship with God, you said you didn’t want to hear it. If I tried to tell you about how my dreams were changing or explain that I didn’t know where I wanted to go and how badly that frightened me, you got mad because you felt like I’d been brainwashed. What was there for me to talk about, then? Work? Whoo! My non-existent friends? Talking about imaginary friends got old a long time ago. What I was doing? Well… I wasn’t actually doing much anymore except adjusting to working full time with no school and life in     California    . I remember getting off the phone with you and crying because I felt like I couldn’t tell you anything. And I wanted so much to let you in. I just felt like we were right back to square one, the same place we’d been before and not gotten anything fixed.               You say I didn't get you well you never gave me the chance and you never tried to show me you just let it go.                You told me at one point that if I kept talking about God, that would be the end of our friendship. You were “happy for me” but didn’t want to hear anything about it. When I tried to explain what part Anthony played in how much I’d changed, you just got angry that I’d “let” him “force” me to change. Everything I tried to tell you about seemed to only make you angry or disgusted. So yes, I did just let it go. Maybe it’s not what I should have done, but it didn’t feel like it made any difference, even when I kept trying.               Besides it seemed like you never really cared what I was talking about be it my life or dreams or cares.                Oh, honey, that’s really not true. I’m so sorry it felt that way. I really did care. And still do. I was so excited to hear about how close you were getting to graduation and that you had concrete plans and knew what you wanted to do. I was so proud of you. And still am. I know you worked your ass off to get that degree and still be working full time. I   know   that is not an easy thing to do, not by a long shot, and I was (and am) so impressed that you were managing it, you have no idea. I am so sorry that I didn’t ever tell you that. And I do care (and did) about what was going on with you. I just felt like I couldn’t comment on much of anything because that would lead to one of the many “forbidden” topics with me.               To me all of this was a betrayal that I could not understand. We were so close you where the one person who knew me the best. The one who understood me and accepted me for who I was. The one person I could tell anything to and not be judged just understood and accepted. Do you have any idea what it felt like to have your friend dump you and leave you with out a word until what 6 mths later                Yes, Alicia, I   do   in fact, know exactly what it feels like to have your friend dump you and leave you without a word until much, much later. Because a phone works two ways and you could have called me, too. We used to have such an amazing friendship. But we both changed. And I know you keep saying you haven’t changed. Maybe you haven’t. Maybe it’s just the way I look at you that’s changed because I have changed. But to me, it feels like you’ve changed too. And we didn’t adjust our friendship to cope with those changes. When we started talking again, it’s like we expected it to all be the same, and there really is no way for it to have been exactly the same. If nothing else, we were 1400 miles apart. That, in and of itself, was a big change to cope with. We have a lot of years of knowing each other and being there for each other. I miss being able to talk with you and bounce ideas off you. I miss being able to talk about the important things and the silly things… I miss knowing what’s going on in your life. I want for us to get that friendship back, but… I also know that in order for us to do that, we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us.               after they have left then not have time. It was almost not worth picking up the phone that first time around it probably would have hurt less then this did. However I will hand it to you that it may have been what was the best for you.                Well, I can understand that. I kind of felt the same way when I first got your response to my initial e-mail. I felt like maybe I should have just let us continue sliding into the greyness because at least it wouldn’t have hurt so much. I think your second comment there was kind of below the belt. I know you didn’t know what was going on with me, and you couldn’t have known that I was looking for reassurance that you did still care about me with my lack of response. I know it’s not how I normally do things—it’s not how I    used to do them, and it’s not how I do them now—but I didn’t know how to ask you for that reassurance. All the same, saying that I was just looking out for me and not worrying about anyone else was cruel, and you know it. You know that the things that hurt me the worst while I was still living at my parents’ was Larry calling me a selfish bitch. So implying the same thing makes me feel like you were using how well we know each other against me. Maybe I’m reading that all wrong and assuming things that aren’t there. I’d really love to hear that’s the case. Maybe I’m just too used to people trying to hurt me. Tell me what you meant by that?               No I don't understand it but there are several reasons for that. One my own issues with guys and letting someone in. Maybe that there lies a major problem I have yet to deal and become better or find that someone that is worth it...yes that is apart of it I am jealous. Oh well.               Honestly, as crazy as it sounds, I’m really glad to hear you say that. For one, because it means you’re really being honest with me. For two, it means I can still probably talk to you about the good things with Anthony, as long as I’m careful and am sensitive about it. And it’s not like I haven’t been there, too…                Second you only called to tell me about the bad stuff that went one between the two of you never the good stuff. So sorry if I developed a biased opinion of him and the situation but considering can you blame me.                That’s true. I know it because I did it with everyone. There are a couple of reasons for this. First of all, it’s just generally our nature to talk about the bad things more than the good ones. Same thing happened while you and Curtis dated. I heard more about the things that drove you bonkers about him than the rest. Second of all, I was really, really having trouble coping with the Anna thing—since I’m pretty sure that’s mostly what I was talking about—and I just needed to talk with someone about it. But you’re right, I can’t blame you for having a biased opinion of him when all I ever did was cry about/complain about/rant about why I was upset with him. The truth is, too, that I felt safer saying the bad things with you because then you got upset at him and not at me, so much. Not such a great reason, but… there it is.               Last you changed and so completely with timing being what it is it happened when he came into the picture. So forgive me if I have a hard to dealing with that but I will try to understand, but no promises it is hard to change ones feelings and opinions.                The thing is, the biggest part of my changing had to do with God. And I know that’s not something you want to hear about, but it’s the truth. I’ve met and talked with my God, and He’s not such a bad fellow after all. And He’s helped me to heal in amazing ways. The thing is, I fell in love with Anthony and God at the same time, and they both made such a huge difference in how I saw the world around me, that it was impossible for me not to change. I didn’t feel like I had to hide all the time anymore, and I didn’t want to run away. Me wanting to go to the moon was all about running away, and doing it in a way that wouldn’t get me in trouble with my parents. It wasn’t coping with anything or fixing anything, it was just running away from it. It’s funny, because that’s one of the things that you used to get so mad at me about, not standing up to my parents and Larry ever. And yet, here I am, and I’ve done that, and I’ve lost them, and I didn’t even get to tell you about it and I didn’t get to cry on your shoulder or tell you what was going on. I wanted to, so badly… did you know that? But so much of it had to do with God that I didn’t feel like I could tell you, even if I’d had the courage to call you at that point.               So If you are still reading this remember that I always tell it like it is and you are right I never take that easy road out so I had to say what I felt. Even if it is not nice. I don't know what to say to you that will fix or change anything because you are right we don't know one another and the things we had in common we no longer have because I have not changed I am still me and that may because I already knew me or have yet to deal with a few things and let the walls down.                So, I don’t want to take the easy road out, and some of the things I’ve said haven’t been nice either. I don’t think there’s any one “magic” thing we can say to each other to fix anything. We don’t know each other, don’t know what’s going on anymore. We may not have much in common in our everyday lives anymore, but I do know that we’ve got our past to build on. I know that we can go from there, and that all this can make our friendship stronger, if we both keep trying. So, cheesy as it sounds, maybe we can both start letting the walls down by trading questions. You ask me a couple questions, and I’ll answer, completely and honestly, and then I’ll ask you a couple. Or maybe you’ve got better ideas about how we could get back on track. (Plus, I promise not to take this long to respond to anything else.)               Who knows if that is the case I may never be able to but that is a whole new letter. A letter I will share if we care to explore and see who we are and what can be salvaged from the ruins of our friendship. I hope that we will be able to but it may be awhile because these are issues that no one knows about and I am not sure if I will be comfortable even telling you for a while because we do not have what we used to have.                It sounds like you’ve had a lot going on, and, with stupid things happening and as long as it’s taken me to write this one, too, I’m guessing even more has been going on. I know it has around here. So… I don’t know how we can get back anything resembling what we had if we don’t start talking. I needed to get this out on paper because I’m never as good with speaking as I am with writing, and this is massively important to me.                But decide carefully if you want to do this because as you should know I am not as strong as I want everyone to believe and I don't know if I can handle starting out friendship to have it dropped again when it is not convenient at least not at this point in my life. If this is what is in store maybe we are better off where we stand now but without the pretending that nothing is different between us because we both know that that is not true. Take your time and take care hopefully I will hear from you soon. Alicia               I think that’s fair enough. I think that you asking that we don’t end up back where we started all over again is reasonable and something I’d like to ask for, too. I want us to talk. If you feel like I’m not making time for you or reaching out enough, tell me. I’m going to do the same. Instead of doing the stupid “I want you to read my mind” bit, I’ll just tell you that I don’t feel like I’m important to you.             I guess the other thing I really want to talk about is… what are the boundaries? I mean… if there are things we just don’t talk about, then we need to establish that right now. And how does that tie into our relationship. Because it’s really, really    hard to feel like I will lose your friendship if I talk about the wrong things. And the stupid thing is that I ended up almost losing your friendship over it anyway because I just stayed silent about the things that are important to me. Obviously, that’s not going to work. So I need to know what I can and can’t talk to you about. I need to feel like this isn’t a one way street. And I need to know what you need.              I don’t know if you’re still reading this or not. I can only hope. I don’t have many friends, and that’s not something I’ve ever really wanted. I do want good friends, and there was a time that I would have listed you without a second’s hesitation. I just want us to have a real friendship. It’s getting late, and I’ve been working on this for an insane amount of time, so it’s all starting to look the same to me. I can’t tell how well it all came out anymore, so please just know that everything I wrote was to help get us heading in the right direction.               Love,
Me.
