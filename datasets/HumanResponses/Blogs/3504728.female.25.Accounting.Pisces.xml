      Someone said that..."When an opportunity presents itself..SEIZE IT. For all you know, the window of opportunity may open up only once in your lifetime"...  All these years, I've seized many good opportunities that came my way... Likewise, I've also made a few blunders and missed some really good chances that could have made a big difference in how my life would have turned-out, had I opted to take those chances...  But I don't have a tinge of regret, as I strongly believe it is fated.... Besides, I'm not really sure I would have been much better off had I made those choices...   My outlook on life has changed, very much different from my younger years...  Back then, I worry too much on just about anything, and I was very scared of being a failure.  Through the years, I've mellowed down and have become a practical person, tackling life realistically as it comes.That doesn't mean that I no longer dream and have no more ambitions. Being a typical Capricorn, I am a dreamer and a very ambitious person, but I try to set my goals to the extent where I think is still realistically possible for me to achieve...and if I fail...I set my goals lower and try to achieve what is logically possible.  For me (now)....Failure is just a process of learning the intricacies of life.  _________________________________________________________   I've seen through life than most people have......  Guess it's just a natural feeling when one's been through a lot of Ups and Downs in life, that he's had it harder than everyone else.....   I know there are a lot more people who's been through life worse than I have... but I'd say that mine too wasn't easy at all... My experiences are more on the down side....sort of a consolation for me that I've learned so much during the time I suffered than when I enjoyed life.....  At my age (I'm not old, I just happen to have lived slightly longer than some people), I would say I have the benefit of hindsight..of being able to look back, appreciate and ponder upon the significance of past momentous events, people who have shaped my life, and memorable places I've been to...  The intensity of life comes with greater uncertainties but also an appreciation of more possibilities...  Whatever comes, I just hope I have what it takes to survive and prevail.......   ________________________________________________________   Life is short....  It is most important to find that elusive piece of life that will give us the best memories which we can ever hope to have...   In our lifetime, there may be numerous times when we think we may have found it and tried to savor every little moment of whatever there is to it...  But in the end, we realize that every little moment spent was just fleeting........  Nevertheless, what is most important are the good memories... and our continuous search to find the best ones...   _______________________________________________________   Life is just a passing scene....   During the most difficult and trying times of my life, I consoled myself with the thought that those moments would eventually pass through - just as happy moments would surely come to an end...I know, I'm not the only one going through that phase in life and I may be more fortunate than the others.  These thoughts alone keep me sane when I'm down on my luck....and give me reasons to continue being optimistic in life.

      I remember so well  The day that you came into my life  You asked for my name  You had the most beautiful smile   My life started to change  I'd wake up each day feeling alright  With you right by my side  Makes me feel things will work out just fine   How did you know  I needed someone like you in my life  That there's an empty space in my heart  You came at the right time in my life   I'll never forget  How you brought the sun to shine in my life  And took all the worried and fears that I had  I guess what I'm really trying to say  It's not everyday that someone like you comes my way  No words can express how much I love you   This is it, imlove! i love this song since the movie "All my life " kahit d ko pa napapanood....its been almost two weeks before i had the lyrics...hanap ako sa google d ko makita until last nyt n desperate n talaga ako...buti n lang i got it ryt...i mean the website so i printed it and dinikit ko talaga siya dito sa may wall in front of meo above my collection of john Grisham books, para pag wala ako magawa pwede ko siya kantahin because im inlove.....

      it just happened.i found myself in love with the person i barely knew.could it be possible? maybe in my case.it develops into something and as days goes by, it went deeper and deeper.before it was just my mind speaking...now, its my heart and i can feel it.the problem is...i'm afraid. i don't even know if he likes me.is it okay to feel afraid? because i am...sometimes afraid of taking a chance...afraid of losing...even afraid of winning sometimes.kung kelan ko nararamdaman na gusto ko na sya..saka naman ako mag-de-decide to let go of him.should i really have to? a case of mind over heart? siguro.i'm scared to love too much...scared to hold on tight.scared of letting go when in fact i need him and want him.-sigh-  by the way, let me share this piece i read in my mail.quite appropriate sa nararamdaman ko at nararanasan sa ngayon.read on.  ---------------------------- The Art of Letting Go ----------------------------  Why do we have to part ways while the love is there? While the friendship is still bonded? Why do we have to cry when someone bid goodbye? Why do beginning has an end? Why do we have to meet only to lose in end?  There are questions left unanswered, words left unsaid, letters left unread, poems left undone and promises left unfulfilled!   In a relationship or even in friendship one of the hardest things to do is letting go and saying goodbye. It is hard as breaking a crystal, because you'll never know when you will be able to pick up the pieces again. More often than not they who go feel not the pain of parting, it is they who stay behind that suffers because they are left with memories of love and friendship...that never was meant to be and never was...  At the beginning and at the end of any relationship we are embarrassed to find ourselves alone, unfair as it may seems, but that’s the way how it goes… that’s the drama, the bitter, the sweet and risk of a relationship. After all nothing is constant but change, everything will come to its end, without even knowing when, without knowing how, without knowing why and we have to forget not because we want to but because we must.  In letting go sorrow comes not as a single spy but in a battalion, it seems that everywhere you go, everything you do, every song you hear, every turn of your head, every move of your body, every beat of your heart, every blink of your eyes and every breath you take always remind you of him/her.  It’s like a stab of a knife, a torture in the night...funny how the whole world becomes populated when only one person is missing. Just imagine there are four billion people on earth yet you feel lonely and empty without the other...  I don’t know if it is worth calling an art, but letting go entails special skills, sparkle with a considerable time and space. Time heals all wounds but it takes a little push on our part. Acceptance plays a vital role. Not all wishes come true. Not all love story ends with "And they live happily ever after".  Sometimes we have to part ways because of circumstances beyond our control, we have to suffer if it would mean happiness for another, and we have to cry to temporarily let go of the pain. Every beginning has an end like every dawn has its dark, its something we can't control, and something we have to live up...  Its over he/she is gone, but life has to go on!! Goodbye doesn't mean forever, there will always be a time where questions will be answered, words will be spoken, letters will be read, poems will be recited in the night, songs will be sung in harmony and love will be expressed in solitude, and promises will be fulfilled somewhere, somehow and someday...  To you, you know who you are...thank you for being you and for helping me to understand some of the joys and sorrows to be found in my life.

      "Being happy does'nt mean everything is  PERFECT . It means that you have decided to see life beyond  IMPERFECTIONS . So don't say you are  HAPPY  because everything is alright. Be happy because everything  SUCKS  but you are doing just  FINE!"

      I hate the way he talk to me,  I hate the way he treat me, I hate the way he stares at me,  I hate the way he read my mind,  I hate him so much it makes me sick;  It even makes me rhyme.  I hate the way he's always right,  I hate it when he lie,  I hate it when he make me laugh;  Even worse when he make me cry.  I hate it that he's not around,  And the fact that he didn't call or didn't bother to text.   But mostly I hate the way I don't hate him;   Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all.

      It’s not exactly the way you smile...  It’s not exactly the way you speak...  Although I know there something very special to it...  It’s not exactly the way you look...  It’s not exactly the way you act...  Although I know I’m very fond of it.  “ I really don’t know exactly what it is in you that makes me want to always be with you, but I do know exactly how I feel.  I  Love  You!  *************************************************************

      5th Avenue ( LRT Station )  Around 7:20AM d2 ako sa Lrt ( 5th Ave ) wait ako lrt ng sabihin ng guard n medyo masikip nga daw ngayon at madalang tren, naku! ang nasabi ko na lang kasi malamang late ako ngayon....( ngayon as in ngayon! ) kasi maaga ako pumapasok simula p nun monday lang. Pero d naman tungkol dun blog ko kundi  tungkol sa mga tao n nakakasabay ko araw araw sa biyahe ng lrt, hay naku! "buhay nga naman parang life" yan ang kataga n masasabi mo n lang pag minsan e sobrang dami ng tao, siksikan, tulakan, at minsan ay d maiwasang may mag away pa habang nasa biyahe....tulad kanina nakasabay ko si Abie ( ofcmate ko ),habang nag kukwentuhan kami about sa bowling ng biglang bumukas pinto ng lrt sa blumentritt station......  Mga aleng papasok:  konting usod naman maawa naman kayo d lang kayo malalate.   Mga aleng nasa loob:  d n nga pwede, o yan masikip n nga wala ng uusugan .  Ng biglang mag sasara n ang pinto:  Isang aleng papasok:hoy!  sandali maiipit ako, maiipit ako...pausod naman ng konti....   Iyan ang mga linya n araw-araw kong naririnig sa mga taong nag uunahang sumakay sa tren ng lrt, hay naku tlaga! Minsan nga magugulat ka may nag aaway n pala, minsan tuloy naisip ko bakit kaya sila sasakay e nakita n nga nilang puno tapos magrereklamo ang sikip sikip daw, minsan naman init init daw, naisip ko tuloy bakit kaya sila dito pa nagsusumiksik e pwede naman silang mag taxi at least dun malamig at maluwag pa, solong solo nila.Kakatuwa talaga pinoy nga naman....

      to turn your back to someone whom you really want to be with  to be pathetic to someone whom you always want to sympathize with  to felt someone feel that he is neglected when in fact he's not very important  to show someone that you don't mind when in fact you know him and his details  to avoid someone when in fact you want to take a stolen glance  to find reason for doing things you don't usually do when you know he's the only reason for doing so  to treat someone realize that his presence is naturally welcom when in fact it creates an extra ordinary excitement  to say things contrary to what you  feel  to laugh aloud when in fact you really want to cry your heart out  to let someone free when you feel he's the only you've got....   ************************************************************ ......sometimes,  we fall inlove at the wrong time to the right person ,and sometimes, to the wrong person at the wrong time....

      Forget his name, Forget his face.  Forget his kiss, His warm embrace.  Forget the face you once stared, Forget the love you once shared.  Forget the times you were together, Remember now he's gone forever.  Forget the times he was so mad, Remember you're the girl he once had.  Forget his gentle teasing way, Forget you saw him yesterday.  Forget the things you used to do, Remember now she loves him too.  Forget the way he spoke your name, Remember that things aren't the same.  Forget he said our love is for sure, Remember now it could just been a lure.  Forget the way he held your hand, Forget the walks along the sand.  Forget the times that went so fast, Remember now, they're in the past.  Forget he said , I'll leave you never, Remember now, he's gone forever.     Just saw this poem in one of my friend's site, so i decided to post it here because i love the message, and it reminds me of someone that i used to love once....
