       How do we know if our water is clean?)   By Lifesmith    	Last issue we explored the importance of drinking enough water. Now we will explore how to insure you have pure water.   So what type of water should you drink? Bottled? Filtered? Straight from the tap?  Today there are many questions about the effects of municipal water supplies on health and even many popular spring water sources can have purity issues.  So what are our options?  The Canadian Natural Health Association recommends distilled or purified water. ·	Municipal water can no longer be assumed to be healthy water.  There are questions about the long term effects of chlorination and fluoride not the mention the nasties that can slip by the water treatment plants. Many municipalities like New York have adopted Ultra Violet water treatment as an alternative to the use of chlorine.  Citizens can always install filter systems to remove chlorine and other impurities before one cooks or showers in municipal water. ·	"Spring water," sounds pure and healthy, but it's just water that comes from naturally flowing springs. It does not have the minerals removed (a selling point for some people), but the downside is that spring water is not yet required to be analyzed for chemical and bacterial levels.  ·	Distilled water has all the metals (both harmful and helpful) removed. Most people find this makes it taste flat.  ·	Purified water has either been distilled or forced through a membrane in a process, known as "reverse osmosis," which reduces the amount of minerals it contains but may leave organic impurities.   So what's the safest way to drink water? Although bottled water may be a step above what comes out of your tap, reverse osmosis and carbon filtering produces what is probably the purest drinking water. Effective filteration removes most of the carcinogens, pesticides, chlorine and lead, as well as bacteria (such as giardia, an intestinal parasite you definitely do not want to have visit you) that are commonly found in drinking water.   We are just beginning to understand the dynamics of how our waste management policies are effecting our ground water reserves. If you are on a well it is wise to have your water regularly tested not only for bacteria but for potentially toxic chemicals that may have found their way into your water supply.   If you have concerns about your water quality take action. Remember the first step to good health is drinking plenty of clean water.    We live in the country. Our well water at home was hard and had higher levels of contaminants then I felt comfortable with. So we installed a sediment filter followed by a softener and UV treatment before the water even entered our water system. Under our kitchen sync we installed a 5 stage reverse osmosis system for our drinking and cooking water.  There are many benefits to filtration but the most important one for me is that my family now loves the way the water tastes and consequently drinks more of it every day which improves their overall health in many ways. It is quite simple, ample and clean water helps to create and maintain optimum health and you deserve to be the best that you can be!  A little  "Food For Thought"    Until next time  Keep Smiling!

       How Much Is Enough?   By Lifesmith   This series explores the joys and benefits of food.  From nutrition to gastronomic delights we will look at the raw materials from which each one of us is created and how to design an optimum diet for both your pleasure and your health.   We are going to start with the basics.  The importance of water! Water after all is the human body's most important nutrient. Most adult bodies contain 10-12 gallons of water and on a typical day, the average adult loses about 10 cups of water just through perspiration, breathing and elimination.   As early as 400 BC, Hippocrates, the "Father of Medicine," recommended drinking large amounts of water to reduce the recurrence of kidney stones. It would seem he was definitely on to something.   Today, most health care professionals would agree, that drinking large amounts of water each day is good for you. It's not only one of the best ways to prevent kidney stones; it's instrumental in promoting your overall good health. Water is an important component of just about every function that takes place within your body.   Drinking enough water allows your body to eliminate toxins and waste products, helps regulate body temperature, helps transport nutrients and oxygen throughout the body, cushions joints and protects body organs and tissues, helps to maintain proper muscle tone ,promotes growth and healing  and helps digest food.   It's easy to take this tasteless liquid for granted, but if your body isn't properly hydrated, it's exposed to a variety of health risks. If you don't drink enough water, cells pull water from your bloodstream, which causes your heart to work harder. If you don't drink enough water, your kidneys can't properly purify your blood causing toxicity that stresses your immune system. Additionally, if you don't drink enough water you can develop a number of minor health conditions, such as constipation, dry and itchy skin, acne, nosebleeds, urinary tract infections, coughs, sneezing, sinus pressure, and headaches.  But it does not stop there…Perhaps we should reflect on the recent research and insights on how water consumption effect our health.  75% of North Americans are chronically dehydrated. Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as much as 3%. In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is often mistaken for hunger.  One glass of water will shut down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100% of the dieters studied in a U-Washington study.  Lack of water, the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue. Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers. A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory, trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen or on a printed page. Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%, and one is 50% less likely to develop bladder cancer.  Are you drinking the amount of water you should every day?  So how much water is enough? In the past it was suggested that everyone should drink eight 8-oz. glasses of water each day to stay fully hydrated. While that's a good start, even this amount may not be enough for optimum health. The minimum amount of water you need, depends on your body weight.   A more accurate calculation, is to drink an ounce of water for every two pounds of body weight. For example, a 140-pound person needs a minimum of 70 ounces of water each day. It's easy to see that the old rule of drinking eight 8-oz. glasses of water - accurate for someone who weighs 128 pounds -- falls short of what many of us need.   Remember the first step to good health is drinking plenty of clean water.  Now you know how much you need, in our next issue we will talk about how to make sure the water you are drinking is pure!
