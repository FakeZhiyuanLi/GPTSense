      August 3, 2002  Ahhhhh.... I'm still speechless.  Miss Juliana was less than 5 feet away from me.  Her performance went by too swiftly for me to capture every note that was invoked, I was in utter amazement.  It was breathtaking.  I hope the pictures came out alright and clear, though the shutter was slow.  Check back by tomorrow night...  Today was magazine day.  For the past few weeks every magazine subscription of mine have all been delivered to my apartment on the same day.  The previous spreading of the periodicals that was once enjoyed is now lost to the inundation of reading that I now endure due to mr. postman.  I am now faced with all of these choices.  I hate decisions.  I cant even decide on what belt to wear between 3, let alone pick what I want to read for the next few hours out of a choice of eight.  I like magazines, but I love free magazines.  I have perfected the art of the "3 months free" promotion that a lot of online stores or credit cards offer.  I have been getting Time, Newsweek, and US & World Report for free for nearly a year now thanks to MBNA.  Jane has been appearing in my mailbox as well for about 5 months, but I do not remember ordering it or even filling anything out for it, but it kicks, so i don't wonder.  I actually pay for Rolling Stone and CMJ.  CMJ's New Music Monthly is my bible.  Every issue comes with a compilation cd of different types of artists, from techno to rock to celtic, you never know what you'll get on the cd though the magazine is more rockish.  The staff is defnitely the most talented music reviewers I have ever encountered.  Plus they're not contradictory (cough cough RS RS)  and know their stuff.  It's like Christmas once a month.  Cosmo and Sports Illustrated also come hither, though not addressed to me.  I have kidnapped them and made them my own even though I don't really read them, I never know when I may be bored.  Or need to attack a fly.  But then the whole swarm of magazines also poses a space issue.  I can't throw away RS or CMJ once I am finished with it.  So my bathroom has become quite the library of entertaining music knowledge.  I just better not find any pages missing...

       August 2, 2002  "I don't always have a clear idea of what I want. I have to struggle to find out because it might be important." –Juliana Hatfield  It’s only a few hours after I wrote the last entry, but this is cause for excitement….It’s is now 12:09 am and it is officially JULIANA HATFIELD DAY!!!!!!!!  She is the reason for my fascination with music.  I first heard of her in 1993 and was just amazed, she was the first musician that I delved myself into, she fascinated me.  And 9 years later, I have the opportunity to see her perform.  Live.  Miss Juliana with be merely feet away from me.  Words cannot describe it, so I am not even going to try.  It will just belittle the emotion.  I will write further on my Juliana tomorrow after the show.  The musician that I idolize will be under the same roof tonight at the North Star Bar.  Wow.    "I feel like I'm too comfortable being alone. I feel like I should hang out with people more of the time. I feel really guilty about that." - Juliana Hatfield

        August 1, 2002  ¡§i've never been to mexico  i never learned to see the sky the way you thought i could listen to the radio they're singing songs about mexico i'm singing songs you'll never hear¡¨ ¡V vaco  I just got back from Cancun.  I can¡¦t believe I went to Cancun.  It was all spur of the moment sponteniety, a trip planned in less than 48 hours.  Though I have flown a handful of times lately, flying still scares the bejesus out of me.  I¡¦ve taken physics, I understand the concept.  BUT HOW THE HELL CAN THOSE GIGANTIC METAL BEASTS STAY IN THE AIR!?!??!  So I made the 3 hour trip to Mexico a booze cruise.  I have to exploit first class to all of it¡¦s potential, so I made use of the free drinks on board and drank the entire trek across the continent.  I was a very happy and calm passenger ƒº.  Though flying scares me, I am fascinated with the window and love looking down below.  The Gulf coast is just amazing.  Teal blue water with the white sand was just breathtaking from the air.  Late in the evening the sky turns an amazing purple and orange shade complementing the sea grean and white foam, definitely one of the most colorful and vivid images I have ever seen.  Tuesday night it stormed and I sat on the balcony and watched the lightning dance across the water.  It¡¦s extradinary to imagine what is out there, beyond our small circle of familiarity and what sights we miss by enclosing ourselves.  Importance is in the small details.  Which reminds me of one of my favorite move quotes in which I will leave you with.  Though I don¡¦t eat quarter-pounders or smoke, but you get the idea.  I will let you in on more little glimpses later.    ¡§I take pleasure in the details. You know... a quarter-pounder with cheese, those are good, the sky about ten minutes before it starts to rain, the moment where your laughter become a cackle... and I, I sit back and I smoke my Camel Straights and I ride my own melt.¡¨ ¡V Reality Bites

      July 27, 2002  The Swedes deserve thanks for many things…namely chocolate, good music, and IKEA.    Every so often I have to make the trek to IKEA, and pay homage to the domestic gods.  I didn’t need anything, but you always come back with something practical when you visit the blue and gold building that is Mecca.  I think half of my apartment is IKEA.  For example, today I purchased a frying pan (we have a few, but you can never have enough, especially not 2 of them for $6.95), circular containers (we just love our containers in this apartment…make food to last a week, hide it in the fridge and find it 3 months later), bamboo (why do I keep getting plants, my room is like a forest), and a green neon dish scrubber shaped like a daschund (to match my neon green dragon noodle scooper that I got a few months earlier).  Quality.  It’s like a bonding experience.  All the shoppers frantically carrying their measuring tape and gold and blue oversized bags to each display of kitschy mass produced items of household goodness.

      "And we live in a beautiful world Yeah we do, yeah we do We live in a beautiful world"  I went to see Coldplay last night at the TLA.  What an amazing show.  I have no idea what to write about though because regardless on how well I depict the performance with words, it will pale in comparison to what was experienced.  What a passion driven performance.  Coldplay rawked.  1 Giant Leap was the opener.  "Opener".  It was a projection and began with Bono introducing the piece,  then four songs followed, with Michael Stipe and Robbie Williams doing a ditty or two.  In between "songs" were interludes on how to make the world better and actions that have hindered self development.  One Giant Leap.  Good concept, but not as an opener.  The crowd booed at it and made snide comments about the film. Everyone expected an opening live band, not a tutorial.    But the Coldplay roadie said it best when he joked "What?!  Are you afraid of fucking learning something?!"

      "I've been so damn tired....It went down at the May parade"  An hour and a half till my radio show and I am exhausted.  This shall prove interesting.  Hmmm...perhaps a donut and coffee run before hitting the studio.  I have nothing really important to say, just trying to keep myself entertained before I spin some discs.  :-)  When I surround myself with the music though, I'll wake up.    I bought a new toy today.  A refurbished Minolta SLR camera.  My previous capturer of glimpses saw its demise a few weeks ago when I dropped it.  And the zoom lens fell off.  And it started making weird whirring noises.  I should have known then.  But no, I had to keep taking pictures with it and I was surprised when they came out all blurry.  Silly me.  I am excited though, I get to devriginize my camera at the Coldplay concert tomorrow night.    Codeplay. In concert. Sold out in less than 5 minutes. Codeplay.  Live.  Woo!

      So when I came back from Cancun all I wanted to do was shower and sleep and eat.  But no, I was greeted by a swarm of ants in my room.  And they weren't marching.  So I released my angst by crushing them with my index finger.  Ahhh...what power I possess over the mighty ant.  The gross thing was when I shook my keyboard about 10 ants fell out. Dead, dead, dead, dead........  So this fiasco has been going on each time I sit at my computer.  For the past few days I go though my ritual of mass destruction then go on my merry way on the internet.  Every so often I discover a straggler.  But there aren't a lot of ants, no more then 10 at my initial sitting, then a few throughout the rest of the day.  But they are only around my desk, no where else.  So about ten minutes ago I destroyed three of them, no worries, it wasn't a harsh death, very quick.  But this one ant was carrying a piece of food.  I couldn't crush him.  I felt bad because I think I killed all of his friends.  I figured I would let this one go because he was brave enough to venture out and find dinner for the ant crew.  They were all probably watching me, the master of their fate, cheering him on and taking bets on the time of his demise.  So I let him go.    But tomorrow he better watch out....

      It's Seeking Homer night :-)  These guys rock, you should definitely check them out.  The rest of the summer is going to be good because I will be spending half of it in various venues :-).  I haven;t seen Seeking Homer play in months, not since their last Grape Street gig.  And tonight they're playing at the Logan house, which is always a great place to get the drink and groove on.   Another highlight of my upcoming week will be seeing Jonasay play again, this time closer to home in Philadelphia at the North Star bar.  These guys are dangerously talented and supergreat.  I have been listening to their upcming cd nonstop, so you should go to a show was well and see what I am talking about :-)    On a related note, my radio show went so well today.  My listeners are great.  I got quite a few phone calls from random people (aside form the people i actually do know) just wishing me luck and saying how much they enjoy the music.  So thank you so much for listening, it means the world to me and I am so elated that you enjoy what I play.  Thank you.

      I went to a concert last night....GASP!  Karen scored free tickets from her internship at WB News for the Vanessa Carlton/Third Eye Blind/Goo Goo Dolls show.  Melissa and Rick came as well, and it was Karen's first concert.  "You have been living with Miranda for a year and this is your first concert?!?!?!?"  - melissa Though I am not really into any of those bands like I am with others, a good time was had by all and we definitely got our groove on.  :-)  I'm pretty boring right now, not much to say.  Summer has gotten slow.  Less than three weeks till school starts again.  Big bad senior year of college.   Yikes.  Natalie, our fourth apartment mate is moving in as I type.  She is really great, 5th year student studying poli sci and education.  I think this year will be great, we all seem to get long uh....i almost typed great for the third time.  Um, this year will be brilliant.  She was in two classes of mine last year and needed a place to stay and we had an open spot.  She's really sweet and fun.  Yay us.  Ok, time to pick out some music for tommorrow.  It's a Thursday and it oddly feels like a Saturday.  You should listen to my radio show.  Everyone should.  It will be a big radio-dj-listener ditty.  3-5pm fridays  www.wvud.org

      I think I have an addiction.  I bought 3 CDs today.  Well, technically 5 if you are counting individual CDs.  It's practically a sin to leave really good music on the shelf.  So I am actually helping others buy buying it.  In more ways than one.  I bought the latest Ash,   Free All Angels, the new Samples, well, it's not new, but its an anthology being released tomorrow, three discs of pure Samples bliss.  And some fool sold a used Stone Roses CD to Rainbow, so of course I snagged it.  Yay for new music.

      So I finally have glasses again.  I lost them, noooooo, I misplaced them a little less than a year ago.  But all is good now.  I feel so much taller now though.  I have problems with steps.   It was my depth perception that was screwed up (yes yes, remember the Mr. No Depth Perception skit on snl...?!) so I have learned to compensate for it.  But then when your vision is magically corrected, you forget that you have adapted.  I can't tell you how many steps I have tripped over in the past 24 hours.   Well, now you all should feel safe now that I can tell where cars are when I drive ;-) Driving at night was a problem with all those glaring lights! It builds character.

      The Seeking Homer show was awesome :-)  I met Mickey, she is a neato girl, we adopted her for the next two days :-)  We made signs so we could be superdorks and give SH a laugh on stage.  It was definitelty crafty.  Check www.mirandaland.com in the next few days to see the pictures...  So then we decided "hey what the hell, lets just drive to the beach and see the benefit show on the beach on saturday" Sleepover at my house :-)  Ok, i hate new jersey.  sorry.  but i do.  5 hours of driving.  I didn't think asses could fall asleep.

      I don't think I really enjoy malls. Everything is just the same thing, just different labels, different prices.  So I go shopping for a few hours and was releived when I discovered an Urban Outfitters.  One hundred and eighty minutes after I started shopping, I went to my car with a UO bag with a pair of jeans and a shirt.  Yay me.  I think I maybe went into 6 stores total.  I don't know, I just seem jaded by the whole mall thing, too much sameness too much unorginality.  Says me who wears jeans and a black shirt nearly every other day.  And I like the guys t-shirts at UO a whole lot better than I do the girls shirts.  Though i still came out with one, I tried in vain to find extra smalls that I could shrink in certain styles, but I didn't come out victorious.   And another factor to the whole mall thing.  I went into Sam Goody and FYE and they suck.  I tried to find a few cds to see how much they were there, but noooo, nothing i looked for was there.  And surprisingly their prices are much higher then Rainbow's.  So leave your mall and come to Newark DE and quench your music thirst at Rainbow.  I didn't even bother asking anyone there about my quest.  Didn't want to interrupt their glazed over faces by having them look on the computer for titles that they should know off hand.  Sam Goody did have fun stickers.   I'm watching Jimmy Eat World's The Middle Video.  Why doesn't anyone have an underwear party? The roommates and I have decided that we are going to have a halloween party.  You have to dress up though.  And bring either candy or alcohol.  A trick or a treat ;-).  Melissa and I will be Pussycats.  Think Josie and the Pussycats.   As we were talking about the Halloween party we were watching that show on MTV that rots your brain...Sorority Life, yeah that's it.  And it was the formal episode.  So we also thought it would be funny if we had a formal at our apartment.  hell, everything else goes here at 5208, why not that!? ;-)  Oh wait, because all of us would be dateless except for Natalie and we would just end up dancing with each other which is no different than any other night.  Oh wait... But yeah, Halloween serious, formal, no just kidding.  C'mon, we're not that low.  ;-) Have a good night!

      I bought my books today.  And a planner.   I buy a planner every year thinking each time that I have new and blank pages for me to graffiti upon and document my trials and tribulations on....but usually after the second week the planner transforms from a reminder book to a coaster.  I have a pretty good memory and super mental calendar skills that using a planner is usually a mockery.I look to my left and I see my marbled purple planner...with a blue cup sitting perfectly in the center.  Sigh. Again, I buy my books every semester and do I read them....?  Sometimes.  I don't understand how one book, not even a book, an UNbook can cost $75.  Maybe if it had a cover it would be worth $75.  But no, it is a stack of papers wrapped in plastic, which is about half an inch thick, and with holes on the left hand side.  Kind of them to pre-punch the holes in the paper.  And that will probably be the book in which only one chapter is assigned.  $75 to read the summary at the end of the chapter.   This semester should prove intersting, usually I take a bunch of television classes or all political science classes, but I threw some variance in there this time.  I'm almost done....more on college later.  This is my fall. Public Speaking Theories of Mass Communication Early Modern European Intellectual History International Human Rights and Film

      I have one full day of my last summer vacation ever left. I can honestly say that this has been the most memorable summer that I have had.  Thank you.  I don't even know where to begin.  Do I group by events, by people, by time...?!  i ma all about groupings and lists and yet here I am with no idea and where to start. Melissa's house was my second home :-)  And i got to complain a lot there.  And ponder.  And drink.  I think I am lucky I didn't get alcohol poisoning. "Damn, I can smell the vanilla from here" - melissa "Oh no no no, I am wearing vanilla." me "Dear, no, that is defnitely your beverage I smell from all the way over here" -melissa :::12 hours later::: "so i looked at the vodka bottle this morning..." (half full) - me "yeah that was definitely all you" -melissa "how the hell did i even get home!?" - me yeah...that was a fun night....  What else hmmm..... Many a night at the bars with Nate then stumbling back to muse over life and all of its shortcomings Michelle's graduation and playing softball at the gathering...sitting outside of the point....at XPN being so jaded about John Mayer and realizing that we have "remember when stories"... The whole Mayer Kahuna experience...ice cream, running down the boardwalk, talking to random people, drinking and dancing and singing  Movies, ice cream, and playing with dead raw fish with Karen and Cari And being at the beach with Kristen FIREWORKS! trekking to the football field with Kristen, Cari,and Nate...then Bennigans.  Cari got 50% off at Bennigans always for working there.  yay for Cari. Playing in Newark with Dan and..."All I want is a fucking beer".... Rides up to Ryan's and the Bistro and galavanting all over Philly.  And seeing a real life GOLD PIMP!  Sitting outside of Jim's steaks at 3am.  Then trying to find my way back to his house at 4 am because someone was too drunk to show me the way.... Spreading the love at WVUD....early early early drives to the radio station at 2 am with 5 cups of coffee just so i can play music on the fm, oh but then i got daytime hours! and i love everyone who calls me and Ims me while I am on the air to tell me how much they enjoy the show.  I love doing it and I am so glad I can share it with all of you. Jonasay.  What can I say, you guys are awesome.  Thank you for letting me tag a long on the road.  Much more fun to come. Mark rocks.  -Glue. Coldplay.  Wow.  I cannot say anything more about that show. Ours.  Stuffed at the Khyber, but at least we found it!  Could barely see, but it soudned incredible... Seeking Homer.  Always a crazy trip.  Went with the whole concert crew for this one.  Michelle, Dan, Nate, Tim, etc.  We kidnapped Mickey, who drove all the way from Massachusetts :-)  And so her and i were dorks and made a sign for the band to make them smile.  Then there was a big sleepover at my house that night before we all drove a few hours to see them again...yeah.... Juliana Hatfield.  My Juliana.  I waited ten years to see her and I finially did.  I met some really cool people at that show and it was just an amazing night of music. And of course Pat McGee Band.  It wouldn't be summer if i didnt see them.  But instead of the usual 20, I saw them twice.  sad face.  They spent most of the summer recording.  But it was enough to see a really awesome show.  Scott gets a hold of me after I get off work and says, "hey lets go to NJ"  So we did.  We met at King of Prussia and luckily he had a map.  Because we really had no idea where we were going.  But after three hours of good conversation and good music we arrive at the venue.  And it looked rad.  A little club right on the beach with bamboo and pools and bars everywhere.  And we meet up with Matt then make our way to the front row in time for Granian.  And such a good PMB performance with new songs and such.  And it was Ben's 22nd birthday.  So of course he goes on stage and gets pizza.  Pat gives him a glass of Jack and says "Here, you have to finish this jack of glass..."  yeah.  It was fun. A sick sick sick show.  :-)  So we leave and replenish ourselves at 7-11 and jet home.  I think i went to bed at 6 am.  But one of the best days of the summer :-) Karen scored tickets for the Vanessa Carlton / Goo goo dolls/ and third eye blind concert.  Getting lost in camden was enjoyable.  we never had so much culture!  then drinking out of guitar glasses and dancing like silly girls...and rick.  karen, me, and melissa danced like silly girls i meant.  a fun show and karens first concert.  yay for karen! Half priced  burger nights at Deer Park.  Yum. Ok, fine, veggie burger.  Still a burger. And half priced appetizers at East End.  Especially the stuffed pretzels.  Even though they do not agree with Nate. East End.  The establishment of the summer.  East End rocks.  Hard.  Oh summer....I don't want to see you go.  :-(  Thank you to everyone.  You are amazing and you let me have fun.  :-)

      "Well, there's a dreamer in my dreams Swinging from the beams With a light shining off the snow Well, there's a singer in my heart Burning up the charts With songs about things we all know"  Do yourself a favor and see the documentary of the making of Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.  So good...so real...so raw.  Now I really can't wait until I see them in Philly.   I went to the Ritz Bourse to see the film.  I love the Ritz.

But it really doesn't matter anyways, because regardless on how you feel, it changes NOTHING!  GRRRRRRR!!!!!  Why does everything have to be so tough!??!?!

Then Bob and Fin show up.  yay.  I am three drinks in.  And when you have M & M's for dinner those 3 drinks really do you in.  So then we progress our night to Deer Park. Cover?!!?!??!  No, we don;t know the meaning of a cover.  So we leave.  But I steal a menu.  word.   EAST END!!! Oh my favorite watering hole.  Oh how I love you.  A few strong drinks later and I am ready to go.

      Happy Friday the 13th!!! I love Friday the 13ths :-)  My birthday is exactly a month away.  But not on a Friday.  I just like creapy dark stuff.  But nothing creepy and dark happened today.  Unless you want to discuss my inability to cook.  That is pretty scary in itself.  The first time I used my stove in my apartment I burned myself.  I think I still have a scar :-/.  Every morning is a constant battle with my cream of wheat.  You have to boil the milk first, so I keep it on the stove at 9.  and it slowly cooks, then like a volcano, I get a mound of white foam across the stove.  It just explodes.  Ok, it doesn't explode...it rises pretty quickly then by the time I grab it it already spilled over onto the burner then it smokes up and if I am lucky the smoke alarm doesn't go off.  It's all about the timing.  I shouldn't be able to handle hot objects that early in the morning. Then the peanut butter incident today.  Did you know that peanut butter also explodes?  I left it in the microwave a bit too long and it kinda just popped and splattered all in the microwave.  That was a first though.   And I still haven't mastered the art which is omelette making.  It just looks like scarmbled eggs with cheese and mushrooms.  Not an omelette.  It looked like the sad remains of an omelette gone bad. My mom doesn't think I eat so she send food about every week.  Just stuff in boxers or freezer stuff.  Food more on my level. :-)  If it be prepared, heated up, and served in six minutes, then it's a Miranda Meal.    Maybe tomorrow I will stick to toast.

      Damn it's been over a week since my last blog, that is an unusually long time for me! :-) Well, it's officially septmeber 11, 2002.  A year.  wow. And where were you? I remember that I didn't wake up to my alarm and I almost misse dmy Italian class.  But I did miss it.  I woke up and started getting ready when Karen told me that a plane had crashed into the towers.  The towers.  I had thought she meant the Christiana Towers, i was loopy, i had just woken up.  But we turn on the tv and every channel...it was amazing.  It was hard to conceptualize.  It was about 9 am.  And we watched it all on tv.  karen and i are total media/tv whores.  we had 5 televisions in the house and everyone was on a different station.  all of our computers were on different sites.  Everything moved so fast.  Talking to so many people on IM, especially peopel that I hadn't talked to in months. Eerily everyone reached out to everyone that day.  My mom works for the government and she had tried calling but we couldn;t get through to each other.  Then we had the brilliant idea to grab a video camera and GO OUT THERE.  Go outside and tlak to people, to be there, to witness.  So karen and i run to the studio (i was news director at the time) and grab our gear and go.  The weirdest thing was that out of a campus of 20, 000 people, no one was outside.  Conveniently UD was having a blood drive that day.  We went there, we went and talked to random people in Trabant, and Professor Begleiter.  Just trying to make sense of it all.  My most vivid memory was going back into the studio and seeing Carlos.  We had a few channels on in the tv studio and me, Karen, and Carlos watched all of them.  Then we all looked at one screen.  It was a close up of the towers.  But somehthing was different.  We look closer...and we see bodies falling out of windows.  And absolutely nothing could be said.... I remember the day after Tom and I had gone out on Main Street and went to the drug store and bought a ton of stuff to be sent to the FDNY.  The DE Book Exchange was sending a bus out there and it was our opportunity to give.   But since then, I have grown.  I have expanded my vision to beyond my circle of sight and ventured out to understand the events that caused the disaster.  Ask me about them.  I have discovered the meaning behind all of this and the motives and reasonings of our enemies.  More personally, I have remained connected to those I have not been close to prior to 9/11.  If anything at all, 9/11 should teach us all to broaden our perspectives.  Realize that there is more going on that your circle of friends or your work or what the latest trend is.  Realize that there are consequences that come with actions that you may not agree with.  Realize that there are many sides to an issue.  Realize that anything can happen.   Since then I have done everything I can to enjoy what I do and to have fun.  No regrets....

      So Melissa's mom caused a state wide bomb scare.  Her mother runs Frightland (www.frightland.com) a huge haunted house shin dig that goes on every fall.  She sent preview passes to Delaware media, politicians, and schools.  She sent the passes in a box shaped like a casket.  With a handwritten label.  And no return address.   Schools got let out early...bomb squads were called in....politicans hid under their desk.  All because most were sent from the Dover post office.  I got my package safe and sound.  It came with a severed hand. Way to cause a ruckus in the entire state of Delaware, Debbie ;-)   But all were amused and all is well.

      Today was a great radio show.  If you didn't know already, You can hear my show every Friday from 3-5 pm on 91.3fm if you are around New Castle County, DE or on www.wvud.org Started off with a little Matt Nathanson as the opener.  Usually I have the air studio to myself except for Rob and Sean making me laugh, but noooo today there were about 7 different people all at one time.  Not that it matters, but it makes me a little shy and nervous haha.  Then I had to transmit one of those "this has been a test of the emergency boradcast system..." yeah right smack dab into the Doves.  Smart, very smart.   Callers!! I LOVE CALLERS!!! And they called!! Just asking what I was playing and words of encouragement.  Wow, everyone rocks.  I get more and more callers each week.  Thank you thank you thank you. And I had a person who wanted to chill with me while I did my show.  He had awesome taste in music, but unfortunately I don't think I caught his name.  So I am sorry, but you know, he did refer to me as Rainbow Girl ;-). I was going to have an on-air interview around 4, but something happened so I was frantically answering phones and playing music and talking and trying to figure out what was oging on when Rabs and Dennis from the DC area band Flood came in randomly to drop off some flyers about their show tonight.  So what the hell, did my first in studio interview and it went pretty well for being so impromptu.  So today defnitely was trying on my DJ skills ;-)  It was almost flawless but it was nearly great.  Thank you so much.

      Apparently I let others down when I do not write frequently, so I apologize.  I will catch you up. :-)  Why? Because you are great.  Let's seeeeeeeeeeee...... My days blend together so I have no idea what has happened haha.  Karen and I drove up to Baltimore randomly to see Mark & Michael from Jonasay play for a few hours.  It was a lot of fun, cute little place.  Well worth the speedy drive.    I gave my first public speech for my class yesterday.  3 minutes went by so quickly and I think I sounded like an ass.  Oh well.   BUT let's go over a rule of life.  if you are a musician, and especially if you don't play in like a year, you keep the damn gig that you booked.  YOU JUST NOT SHOW UP!!!  Quite sad when you go to a concert and see the usual crowd who has seen a certain band for the past 4 years, a band that practically defines your college life, and gaze at an empty stage.  Definitely not cool.  But Melissa, Rick, and I went to East End last night.  I lvoe the East End.  I think I have said many times before.  And I ran into someone who I have not seen or talked to in years....very cool though ;-) East End has yummy cheese fries.

      Oh what an awesome day.  Start at Rainbow Records and end at East End and in between a road trip and a concert. Work was fun, always is.  The Nate and I trekked to Baltimore to see Cinema 8 pmay the Volkswagon festival.  They were great.  I guess I should start at the rest stop... So I guess I have this "habit" of misdriving, it's not that I drive inattentively, it's just that I have misadventures.  Like not even seeing red lights, for example.  Well, I went through the truck part of the rest stop and was trying to figure out how to get my little Cabrio out of the maze of big rigs.  Apparently there was an innocent bystander standing in my treacherous path.  In slow motion, Nate brought up his arm and pointed at him telling me to watch out.  The poor guy was like a deer in headlights and was so startled that he had froze and jumped up.  Of course I hadn't, and still haven't been able to get that image out of my mind.  Poor guy.  I think he shit himself. Amazingly we made it Johns Hopkins University.  Alive.  We almost died when I had to cut across oncmoming traffic suddenly onto a road I couldn;t see.  there was a guy on the telephone right on the corner.  I think he said "Damn that crazy white girl don't know how to drive.  I think she tried to kill me."  I saw the whites of his fearful eyes.  Nate said I am not allowed to drive in unfamiliar places again.  Oh, and I hate mapquest.  What gives.  There is n exit right off 95 for JHU, but noooo they want to take us 15 miles through Baltimore.  Regardless we found the place.  And Michael rocks and got me a press pass and a VIP ticket to get in, so we enjoyed a very cool show.   On the drive back we missed an accident by minutes and beat the ambulance there.  So Nate and his kick ass EMT self went and helped the people.  Luckily no one was seriously injured, but it looked like one doozy of an accident.  The we were entertained by Radiohead and Wilco.   Hello exit 109.  Hellow Newark.  Hello East End.  So we end the night with 1/2 priced burgers and drinks at East End.   Yawn.  I am tired.  Good night.

      Last night was Nate's 25th birthday.  :-)  Obviously, we went to East End.  It's pretty awesome when you run into people that you haven't seen in months...years even, and nothing really changes.  That's the beauty of East End.  Always seem to be running into someone....and they have a pretty kickass juke box chock full of good music. Going to Baltimore this evening to see Cinema 8 play.  I'm excited.  I get to play photographer.

      It is pretty sad that I cannot even recall how many times I have run from the Scrounge to some other part of campus.   Well....we taped the first episode of the THIRD season of Center Stage.  I can't beleive it.  Thank you to Cinema 8.  I can't even conceptualize on how great this season is going to be.  So of course when we have to lub hundred of pounds of equipment a quarter mile, it rains.  No, it doesn't rain, it pours.  Hard.  So Dave, Matt, and Aurora took the equipment to the scrounge while I engineered the studio class.  Dave calls from a payphone saying that we need more battery.  The concert was going to start before i could get there so he said for me to just bring it when i come. No no no no no.  SO I have 20 minutes.  Countdown begins. I quickly grab all the canon batteries i can, shove them in a trashbag, tell the professor that i am going to run to the bathroom, then I run out of Pearson, and down Academy to the Scrounge.  Running like a banshee holding a trashbag.  I got beeped at.  Twice.  But i made it, soaking wet and out of breath, but I made it.  Then I ran back.  No questions ask.  There are no obstacles for Center Stage. The show went soooo well.  Well, besides my loss of hearing......Nothing like standing right in front of the speakers with a headset that only amplified the sound for two hours.  Yeah, I cant even hear myself type.  It's a wonder that I am not deaf now.But the show was incredible and the guys are great.  A thousand thank yous.  It will be airing October 9th at 11 pm on STN.  Hopefully I will be able to get a short clip or two onto the website.   Oh yeah, and we had to take all the quipment BACK.  And the only thing worse than taking the equipment there in the rain and coldness and darkness is that it has been raining for 5 hours since we got there which only means the puddles got bigger.  We were soaked, but it was fun.  This was great. So today I gained a few things..... almost deafness and pnuemonia oh yeah and a kickass crew and show!!

      As a tv/radio person, I live by the clock.  Time is very important. I try to use every available second for all it is worth.  I think I have perfected pushing time.  In my fourth year as a college student I think I have devised every which way to extend sleeping time.  Take this morning for example.... Class is at 9:30am I have to leave by 9:15 am. I HAVE to check my email when I wake up, minus 5 minutes....now down to 9:10 I don't wear what I wore to bed, but something equatable...today, a t-shirt and adidas pants (a university uniform if class is held before noon), minuse 3 minutes...now down to 9:07 didn't shower the night before, will save that for AFTER class ;-)  2 minutes.....9:05 No time to brush teeth, mouth wash and a stick of gum will suffice until 11 am.   See, it's almost an art.

      I really can't cook.  Who ruins pasta!??! Oh yeah, me. So I didn't know how this whole "having a kitchen" thing would work out last year.  Handing my try to ladies in hair nets was so much easier.  So was scooping out salad from a big bowl.  Burners......oven...heat....what a concept. I have mastered a few meals that keep me alive and not starving.  One, I thought, was pasta.  Oh so easy, oh so thought free.  Just boil and heat.  Oh no.... Lately I have been making a lot of pasta and just fridging it so I can just nuke it later.  So this afternoon I was boiling water, then put a whole box of pasta in.  Usually it takes about 10 minutes.  About 30 minutes later Karen came in telling me that she thinks that my pasta is done.  Oh it was done.... Screw it, I drain the wilted water sogged bits of pasta and put it in the fridge.  After hours in the TV studio I was starving... So I take out the pasta container and all the pasta kind of form together into a brick like shape.  So I cut myself a square and ate. How the hell have a survived a year independent?!?!  More musings on my "independence" tomorrow with such adventures as laundry and ironing......

      Oh what a fun filled day yesterday....AND IT WAS A 21 DAY!!!  Yes, I still do that.... So at noon I hit the road.  In the Cabrio for the trip to VA: The Clarks, Jonasay, Radiohead, Brand New, Wilco, Andy Stochansky.....yes a wide mix. I love rest stops, they are the highlight of my trip.  Free maps free maps free maps. Hello Virginia.  I love Virginia.  Arlington was nice, found the club ok and free parking on the weekend.  What more could I ask for.  Met up with some peopel at the Juliana Hatfield show.  Oh she is so beautiful and talented.  She played solo and I was a mere five feet away.  Oh yes.  She pulled out some old favorites and unreleased songs.  It was magical. :-) So then I had a few hours to kill before heading to Centreville for the Jonasay show.... So I found a coffeehouse and read for 2 hours before I discovered a music store.  So I hung out there before heading onto I66 once again.... Hi Centerville.  Hi lots of deer and horses.  Hi wrong way down the highway. But alas I found the Shark Club :::insert Jaws theme song here:::  And Jonasay but on yet another rocking show, despite intial sound difficulties.  I hope the pictures came out ok.  The highlight of the show was when Justin told some drunk lady "How about this, at night i will come into your place and interrupt you while you are performing".  Haha.  No, i take it back, the highlight of the show was Mark's setlist on drywall. :-) And checkout the Excentrics...Technicolor....whatever they are now, if i wasn't so damn tired i could have enjoyed them more, but they really rocked.  Thank god for comfy couches. 120 miles later (one hour, forty minutes) i was home.

      I went and saw Seeking Homer last night.  And the night before.  Word. I finally got to finish taping them for Center Stage and I can even describe how good it turned out.  I have such a wonderful crew.  Seeking Homer is one of my favorite bands and they are the greatest guys so I feel very fortunate in being able to feature them.  The interview was great.  ahha.  So Aurora and I decide to pack up and haul ass to baltimore to Fletchers.  Parking is fun.  Especially during a festival that we didn't know about.  Took me like 20 minutes to parallel park without hitting the curb.  But yay we made it.  Why is it always a victory for me to find places?!? The show was great, despite them not getting to Dilemma or Astray ;-) .  Got lots of great pictures.  They sounded awesome and it was such a cute little venue.  The Can't Hang came on.  Fun stuff fun stuff.   Aurora and I found a new hobby.  And trying to remain "professional" is going to be hard hahaha.   But I do beleive the highlight of the night was......ZOMBIES!!! Oh geez....!

      Again....i have to quote Nate quoting me.... this was in his aim profile today:  From Mir's Blog:  while driving back, less than 5 minutes from my apartment I hit a damn raccoon. Look, you either go left or right. There is no dancing in front of my headlights. I tried to miss him, I really did!! I just didn't anticipate his tango!    Yeah, I agree with that sentiment, but saying "Oh well, his stupid ass should have got out of the way" after hitting it is a little uncalled for.

      One of the highlights from the beach trip... I CAN DRIVE REALLY!!!!  But as we were in Rehoboth, Nate screams this to the wanderers from my car.... "You better watch out!! She will hit you!! I've seen her do it!!!"  And of course while driving back, less than 5 minutes from my apartment I hit a damn raccoon. Look, you either go left or right.  There is no dancing in front of my headlights.  I tried to miss him, I really did!! I just didn't anticipate his tango!

      Dewey Beach Music Festival Oh what fun..... Nate and I drove down and met Josh at the beach. Where?  Down by da beach....BOOOYYYYEEEE!!!!! Started at Watertown to see Juniper Lane but unfortunately one of the members got into an accident on the way.  So we go to the Cork.  But not without playing "don't ever let me dance like THIS" on the side road to the Cork.  The Cork was loud.  Off to the coffeehouses and the Lighthouse.  Great music there and wonderful people.  Met so many industry people and musicians.  Thank you for new music to play. Off to the Rudder to see Jonasay.......... Great show as always and the naked cowboy loved them.  They rocked till the lights came on.

      ahhhhh Homecoming weekend....when else can you go to Pathmark at midnight on a Friday night and actually stand in line with other people all holding breakfast food.  Eggs and Kegs.  And all the store brands.  Cheapness is where its at.  But we're not having eggs or kegs.  We did that two years ago.  We're now tailgating.  But instead of BBQing...since we're starting at 9 am, we're soing the breakfast thing since we're not allowed to do the grilll thang because of the drought.  It was also like a small little family in the liquor store.  How many different things can you mix with OJ?  I can't wait to see everyone again :-)  I can't beleive how lmuch time has passed and how far we have travelled.  What a long strange trip its been....

      I like to make to-do lists so I feel a semi sense of accomplishment and fulfillment while I cross tasks off.  Makes my life seem sort of in order and prioritized.  I make a new list every few days and tack it right to my computer monitor, because, if you know me, I am always here.  At my computer.  Wherever I go, there I am! But sometimes, when my list seems extremely difficult, I add mundane thinsg to my list.  Like "brush teeth", "make brita water", and "water plants" so that way I still feel fulfilled and worthy of my time by corssing of things on my list, even though I would do them if they were't on my list. I get by on little victories.

      I set off the smoke alarm again.  And this wouldn't have happened if the maintenence man would have left the damn thing on the floor.  See, I had set it off so many times before that I just ripped the sucker out because it was annoying.  We have about ten in our apartment, so there was defnitely no chance to burning to a crisp. I had a candle burning.  yes, a candle, and yes, only one candle and the damn smoke detector went off.  I look over and its a burning inferno, but still ONE CANDLE! So I grabbed the thing, surprising i remeber to cover it with something so my hands wouldn't sear off, and threw it in the sink.  No more candle, it was a flaming mess.

      I think October is my favorite month.  I love Halloween.  I went to Pathmark and bought a few bags of Halloween candy.  The best Halloween candy ever are the Russell Stover Peanut Butter Pumpkins.  Spooky. I love the weather, cold and blustery enough for a sweater, but not so much the jacket.  Leaves start to fall and the trees are always swaying with the wind.  You can see your breath and your nose is always the first to feel the bitterness.  But it's refreshing.   The days get darker earlier and you find more excuses to go outside. Pumpkin carving...apple picking...haunted houses...

      I love our little music store :-)   We're moving...once again, no more books, just music and down the street.  Ahhh...yet another week of moving, but only good things can come of this. And it was awesome to hang out with everyone outside of Rainbow.  And hearing crazy stories.  And letting Raf know how silly we actually are.  And bashing customers.  Oh wait, we don't do that... We call the music register place the pirate ship.  I wonder if in the new place if we can wear eye patches, pirate hats, and carry a bottle of rum.  Wait, we drink in the store anyways.  Hahaha...last year around Christmas there was this "random" bottle of scotch in the back, and we all would drink from it but not all admit to it (we would always go in groups of 2 or 3, never alone, we're not that lushish!) and so we all found out tonight that we all contributed to the drinking of the scotch on the job.  and sneaking galsses of wine....then owen would say "dammit, just drink it, no one cares!" oh man, crazy times crazy times.   But Rob broke the nutpen.  The nutpen has been a part of Rainbow for over a year.  A bic pen with a metal nut around it.  Rob got fed up and broke it.  It was a sad sad sad day for the nutpen. And see....i thought it was common knowledge that i thought a certain guy with a wife and kids that always comes into the store was really hot.  The Raf asked me if i was "fucking nuts".  Yes, "fucking nuts" was the correct term he used. And Terry Potts.........Terry is an older man that hits on all the girls, and older, i mean like 80.  And he creeps all the girls out.  Well, we decided next time we're just going to tell Terry how incredibly hot he is and if he will unbutton his shirt for us.  Slowly.  Seductively. And tomrorow will be another fun night in Rainbow.

      My computer is sick :-(  It has a virus.  No idea how I got the damn thing, but I can;t get rid of it.  My virus protection stuff sees the virus but does nothing about it.  It says it cannot delete the corrupt file.  Anyone want to help me? :-P  On a better note.  I am taking up stock in wawa coffee.  I was editing Center Stage form 11:30 am til 1:30 am.  Yes That is 14 hours.  Oh wait, I went to lunch.  Minus 2 hours.  And technically I didn't work on it during my meeting, so minus another hour, but thats still TV stuff ;-) .  And sports was using the editors at that time as well, so ok, maybe not a complete 14 hours, but still that is 12 hours i was in that damn building! BUT IT IS DONE!!!!! The first episode on Center Stage is done done done done done.  And it is mucho excellente.  I work with the greatest people.  :-)   Mondays just shouldn't exist.  I mean, it is not like anyone ever takes Mondays seriously.  It's just an extended Sunday. And my weekends always start on Wednesday.  So I guess my week constitutes just Tuesday.  Damn the work week.

      I don't know if last night really happened or not. It was so amazing and unreal.   Charise and I have been looking forward to the Ryan Adam's concert for so long, thank you Dan for tickets.  Dan rocks.  Hard. SO Charise and I leave Delaware, listening to the Ours cd the whole way up screeching and creaming and saying "oh my god" the entire way up 95 and 476 haha. Ahhhh...Popeyes french fries.  So Cajunny goodness.  Then Dan calls.  Uh oh!  Melissa forgot our tickets at home but they will buy us new tickets.  Oh no it's sold out! "Hi, do you need tickets? I have two for the third row in the pit." CHA-CHING! He didn't look sketchy, he had a card, and he walked us to the door.  AW YEAH!! Charise and I went insane.  The show was one of the best I have ever been to.  I had my jaw dropped most of the time.  Sounded so perfect.  None of the radio songs yay, and all of Heartbreaker and just all musical goodness.  He gave out 4 guitars.  Yeah.  Four.  Guitars.  Some girl shouted out that he had a nice ass and she got a guitar.  Damn, what would I get if I told him he could have my body haha.   And we got "Come PIck Me Up" for the closer, one of my favorite Adams songs.  Soo so so so so so good.

      Now added to my long list of "things that Miranda should not be allowed to play with": hot irons.  Let me embellish..... I am cursed with naturally curly hair, so I straighten it every morning with a straightening iron.  As I tam typing this, I have two large burn marks on my forehead.  I look like freaking Gorbachev.  I also have a scar on my foot and a permanent triangle on my forearm.   On the bottom of my left foot I have a bubble that has not gone away in months.  You see...I plug in my straightening iron, but since my sink does not have space on the edges, it heats up on the floor.  Yeah...early in the morning, I am not that swift, I accidently stepped on it.  Oh I woke up right quick. And the arm.  Two years ago I was ironing my shirt while it was on me.  Oh come on, I didn't want to take it off and i didnt have an ironing board.  Well, I missed and the tip of the iron singed my arm.  Hence the triangle.   Now that I think about it, in my mom's house, I left an iron mark.  I dropped the iron onto the carpert and the carpet is made out of synthetic material so the iron melted the carpet into a nice glossy triangle.  The couch is over it now. So now ironing has been added to my list of "Problems Miranda has with Domesticity".  We have already tackled cooking and ironing, laundry is next.  Stay tuned.

      Now my rant.....and I am sorry melissa i have tried to make my last few blogs amusing just for you since i know it is the highlight of your day, but i feel like blah  Too make a long complicated story short, I had Mono a few years ago but it was misdiagnosed and because of that misdiagnosis, I now have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. It has no cure and can take months to years for it to go away if it ever does.  I don't have bouts of it too often, only a few times a year, but it is triggered by stress and usually hits me hard.  Yeah, I am going through it now and I can't even explain the pain that I am enduring.  The throat is always the worst for me.  And 4 cups of hot herbal tea in the past hour has done squat.  And I hate medicine.  I always use medicine as a last reserve and try to use natural remedies to make everything better.  But with what I have , it isn't viral, so it's not like anything would help, just mask the pain.  So grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr................ And i was going to find a medical list of symptons so you can share my fun, but found some cool stuff on WebMD that I didn't even know before and so now i feel like i sounded like a doctor up above.  i will leave you with some informational medical gibberish so you will feel fulfilled and entertained.....hopefully by the time you are done reading, i will be asleep... - Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) may develop without warning in a person who has not been sick. In some cases it develops after a viral illness, such as mononucleosis (mono) or influenza (flu), or after a period of unusual stress.  - Forgetfulness, memory loss, confusion, or difficulty concentrating. Sore throat. Tender lymph nodes in the neck or armpits. Muscle pain. Joint pain without redness or swelling. New headaches. Unrefreshing sleep (waking up feeling tired or unrested). Fatigue that lasts more than 24 hours after exercise or exertion at a level that the person was able to do in the past without fatigue.

      Sunday didn't really effect me, it felt like my brithday was on Saturday and we celebrated on Saturday, so Sunday was just an ordinary day.   Played with the horses, went home for breakfast, cleaned, concert. Jonasay's CD Release was on my birthday, yay for everyone!!  Aurora and Burket and Heather and I trekked down to Towson for the show.  Road trips are always fun and we had a blast.  They put on a really great show and its awesome that my friends are getting into them.  I think Aurora's night was made after a certain comment....she then replied with "Yeah, that could not have been said better....."  I don't think the roar of laughter was needed ;-) So great meeting so many people and putting faces to names.  I am drained so I am sorry for the lack of color in my musings..... But it was defnitely a passion driven performance which was just incredible.  The band played nearly everything and a good time was defnitely had by all.

      No idea where to begin so I will probably post several times before I fall asleep.... Let's start with Saturday.... Yay for Michelle coming down.  We all  tailgated for breakfast.  I think the morning started off right when Michelle, Double A, and I started shrieking at the moth I thought was a stick flew.  At least we were at a red light.  We find a great spot and started to eat breakfast.  I had brough bagels.  Frozen bagels.  Right out of the freezer.  Whoops!!  So we made our way around and it was so great running into people I hadn't seen in a while....especially girls from the team and old COMM majors.  I always run into Lauren at the craziest places.  First met her....damn, was it four years ago!?!?  Yes, we met at a concert, Pat McGee Band of course.  Strange how PMB is linked to practically everything in my life haha.  And we've hung out and randomly see each other ever since.  So very cool.  So before noon we were plastered.  Then to grottos.  Poor Karen we terrorized her!!  She has these pants that she claims are too small....so i had to yell out "nice ass karen" a few times (or so i was told, i don't recall) before she had to tell me to pipe down that it was a family restaraunt.  So we go back and nap to begin part 2 of homecoming (and celebrating my birthday ;-) )  So yeah....Kates then East End.  And soooo many people came, thank you guys so much i had a great time :-)  I had to split my time between outside and inside of East End because the group slit up, but it was just so wonderful to be with everyone.  Thank you.  And you would be proud of me, I gave up drinking...yes again...so I didn't drink anything after noon.  Oh geez, how many times has that sentenced been uttered.  Not by me i mean, but who says that!?!?  haha ok...on to Sunday!

      Yeah, there are a lot of things that melissa and i find funny, but apparently not everyone laughs with us.   We watched Kundun in class today adn talked about Tibet and China after the movie.  There was this leader in China whose name sounds like "Who Ya Banged".  So of course after hearing the prof say this a few times I really wanted to make a comment to Melissa, but I bit my tongue.  I look over at her and I can tell she wanted to laugh, her face was getting red from stifling laughter.  So i lost it and that made Melissa break as well.  Yeah we were the only 5 year olds in the class that laughed. Come on, where's your sense of bathroom humor?

      And I just read jen's Blog.  It has nothing to do with dinner.  I forgot that October 21st is one of my favorite days of the year, but it was a good day indeed despite the craziness.... from jen... "Today is producer-rant Sunday :) Or, every Sunday is producer-rant Sunday. I didn't have any stories for my show, nor did Brittany, and Whitney didn't have any ideas for hers. So we did the convesation-through email thing we do best. I swear, Brittany, Whitney, Miranda and I have had too many STN conversations through mass emails to each other to count :) I guess that's what happens when we each work on 5 shows, huh :) "  My favorite is how we make fun of other people through mass email.  A note to youself..... Don't be a freaking idiot loser dork face or you won't get made fun of.  Thank you. Oh yeah and there is no candyland to be had in the studio.  Especially not when you rock the ice ice baby.

      It's now 2:41 am and I have barely slept in the past few days.  I think I have insomnia.   You know you have spent too much time around cameras when your initial thought to most events is "damn, I wish I had a camera".  How many times do I say that a week!?!?  And one of the most important rules is to say that in front of the STN crowd and not your "normal friends" and yes girls, I definitely did do the finger quotes.  I went to the Scrounge with Jen, Whit, and Brit (and yes I did it in that order so it would be kitchsy that it rhymed) and was so disoriented.  It throws me off kilter when something you were once familiar with alters so you are thrown off balance.  I seriously had to pause to reflect on how I must think about my actions instead of acting on instict in the Scrounge.  I just got so overwhelmed that I joined Whitney for quesadillas.  With the grande mexi-meal, you get beans and rice.  Once Whitney saw the beans being plopped onto the plate she promptly changed her order to the "un-grande".  I updated Brit that Whitney was not getting the grande and I used the finger quotes and Whiteny informed me that no finger quotes were needed, that she definitely did not want the grande-ness included with her mexi-meal.  The grossest part of dinner was when my orange juice bottle stood "completely" "upright" when I "stuck" it "upside-down" in the "beany mess".  I wish I had a camera.

      Yes....I just found the Breakfast Club on TNT.  I barely go beyong channel 19 and my certain few channels, but low and behold there is a gem on 12.  I rarely stray from my dependable channels, though there is usually nothing of quatlity on.  Funny how I am a broadcasting major and don't watch tv much.  The HBO's, Comedy Central, and MTV 2 get all the action from my remote.  And since I found a great movie on TV, I will share with you my favorite movies, in no order, but eight is great.... 1. Empire Records (how much does this remind you of Rainbow....?!) 2. Good Will Hunting 3. Shrek (not my buttons, my gumdrop buttons!) 4. To Gillian on her 37th Birthday 5. The Emperor's New Groove 6. Down to You (cheesy teen film, but its all goodness :-) ) 7. Best in Show 8. Sixteen Candles

      I just slept about 20 hours in the past tow days.  Being sick sucks.  I will share with you the troubles of having a cold..... Sleeping....yeah the whole process makes you even wonder if it is worth attempting to sleep.  First off, you can't breath through your nose, and if you can breath through you're nose it burns and there is whisteling, which won't allow you to sleep anyways.  But still, you can't breath through your nose, so you must sleep with your mouth open.  My throat has been killing me, so breathing through my mouth just worsens the issue.  On the same topic, the nose.  It doesn't run symmetrically, no one nostril always has the be the winner.  It's always one side that runs and the other doesn't.   So that determines which side you sleep on so that you don't have to grab the tissues as much.  And if you are compulsive and obsessive like I am, the side you fall asleep on is a big deal.  We're not even going to start on the muscle achiness. But my mom is the coolest because she brought over green and oolong tea.  Yay.  With the power of the leaves, I will be back in action tomorrow, but for now, it's back to bed.

      i saw whitney at the loop!!!! and jen writes this in her blog and i love them all to pieces :-) :: Tuesday, October 22, 2002 ::  Yay for STN girls :) I had dinner with Miranda, Whitney and Brittany tonight, and it struck me how well we all knew each other. I could predict when Whitney was going to make the "what the hell was that face", when Miranda would laugh, and when Brittany would try to explain herself to us. And the funny part was, I think that was the very first time the four of us did something together. It's just that when you work with someone so much, and you go through the same things that they do (and no one can understand the hell that is STN unless you've been through it, period:) ) you really do form some kind of freakish bond with them. And I mean freakish in the best but oddest way there is :) But I love my girls, don't know where I'd be without them.

      JonaDAY part one.... it's almost midnight on thursday night and its really funny how aurora and jen have tomorrows activities in their away messages ;-)  Oh oh we;re addicted to AIM.  We're COMM majors, what can I say...but these made me laugh...then I will talk about the previous JonaDay's excursion... Aurora: i'm at cookseys filling up on some hops and grains...hehe...celebrating early for Jonaday!! :-D Jen: Study study study, what else is new :-)  Feel free to IM me, I'm here Tomorrow is Jonaday #2!  How fun :-)  Ok, time to spill it...but since I am a COMM major, I will play the role of GATEKEEPER.  You figure it out.  I think the foreshadowing of the night occured when Aurora, Matt, and I went to pick up the vehicles.  I had a new minivan, while the truck looked like it was built in 1970.  I don;t think matt appreciated my Jed Clampett reference ;-).  But we got our gear in and we were ready to roll!  First stop...Wendy's.  Fries and Frosties rock.  Then onto Jersey....then I realize that I have no idea where we are going.  We all thought the others knew.  Oh well, we'd find it, even in the dark raininess!  So we get to Glassboro and find the school but cannot find the RAT.  yeah the freaking renovated rat.  I'll get to that later.  So Matt was following me, though I had no idea where we were going.  As Jen pointed out, our quest around campus looked like a scene from the video game Simpsons Road Rage.  he went the opposite way down the street and went in the entrances where I said to avoid and we could never catch up!  But alas, we found the parking lot..... Same old same old setup.  Everyone was great.  Ohhh the funny part.  So Aurora was getting the Canons ready when she asked for me to come over.  So I was asking why, and she kept repeating for me to come over.  Me, and not Dave.  So then I was worried!  We're all crowded around Aurora (except Dave ;-) ) to see that the eye piece of the camera was dangling off!!  NOT GOOD!!!  (we avoided Dave since he is the wiser of us all and very protective of the equipment and we did nto want to start panic).  But yay for Justin having superglue.  Oh come on, we're STN , did you really expect more from us? ;-)  JonaDAY part 2 tomorrow.....this should be an adventure.  McGuyver style.

      I swear I need to write a book about the adventures at my record store... We have our list of crazy customers..... This one apparently I met last year but I don't recall him, but he remembered who i was.  Fair enough.  So its awkward conversation then he leaves.  Then comes back.  then leaves again.  Jamie, Charise, and I stand around befuddled.  Then the creepy man comes in (mind you our male managers aregetting a real hoot out of this) and says "hey, can we go out for coffee soemtime".  We look at each other not sure who he was talking to, so I grab some cds and start running some info on them, Jamie grabs the phone, and poor Charise is left defenseless while she lies to him telling him that she has a boyfriend.  We then goes on to pester her about it and then says "well miranda wont go out with me, so why don't you".  Charise is trying not to laugh and jamie and i are avoiding eye contact because we don't want to start crying.  We then leaves, but not before shouting "its ok, i have plenty of lady friends".  I swear, the three of us were on the ground while raf mocked the poor guy.  It was all I could do from not laughing out loud.  And the best part was was that customers stopped and stared at the whole ordeal.

      I know you are dying to know the funniest thing i have done all semester is.  And oddly enough it doesn't invove me making an ass out of myself. So i am in my room quietly reading when my roomate natalie comes in with a water balloon and a twinkle in her eye. She wants to throw it off our balcony and hit cars.  i want to hit people.  So we round up the roomies.... We fill up a few and arm ourselves. I live in a four story apartment building with two sides to it.   The first attack..... natalie and i run to the 3rd floor balcony on the stair case and hit a car aiming for the open sunroof.  We miss, but the car still gets wet.  We need something better.... Second attack..... We see a car of girls unpacking things from their car.  perfect.  We run through the woods behind our house.  Of ocurse we're dressed in pajamas and sandals because its 1 am.  We run all the way to the top of the floor....and bombs away!  Oh yeah it was great.  People screamed, things got wet.  Oh shit! Time to run!  Not knowing how to escape since there is only one out, oh we were smooth and got home safely. Mission accomplished.

      So on Friday Jonasay came down for my radio show.  It was great, thank you to everyone involved. So after my nervous breakdown and three cups of coffee, everything went well. Rob had tagging Satellites come in for a session in production room 1, and he was going to leave everything up for me to use.  Oh would have been great if the band he brought in wasn't 2 hours LATE!  So I figured if they are out by 3 i should be good.  No.  Let's begin at 2:30.  This is in no way aimed at Rob, its just a funny situation on nothing goes the way i plan ;-).  So I am trying to figure out when the hell am I supposed to do.  Then Dave says "oh yeah just have them play in the studio".  Oh yeah sure.  Nothing like fitting anything that should make music into the cubicle I call an air studio.  But it worked and it rocked.   I received so much positive feed back, especially from random people that I do not know, that it made my day.  Everyone enjoyed the work of my crew and how the studio session was hard to differentiate from the cd.  yeah that crew was me.  only me. haha So after we go to East End.  Like Disney World, it's the greatest place on earth.  Then to Chestertown.  My mom called and left a message on my phone... "rock stars have kidnapped my daughter" name that movie. speaking of that movie....ryan made me laugh.  so the mom that was in almost famous was in beyond rangoon, which we were watching the other day.  So in the middle of class the mom comes on screen and ryan yells "don't do drugs!!" (a quote from almost famous).  yeah, only him and i laugh.  i swear i think my professor thinks i am a 5 year old dumbass.

      Ok, due to popular demand, I AM BLOGGING!!!! Hmmm, so what to write about...? I told Melissa I would write about our wonderful mall excursion.  I don't know why I shop at malls.  We walked three hours in King of Prussia mall only for us to buy stuff at 2 stores.  And it was the two stores that we came to see.  And we have banned Christmas.  The Christmas season should NOT begin before Thanksgiving.  there is nothing Christmassy to be had in the month of October. None.  It should be ghosties and ghoulies and goblins.  Only to be followed by cornucopias and crisp leaves.  Only after the turkey is cut and the last drop of eggnog swilled should there be any good will and merryment.   Soon we'll be celebrating Christmas right after 4th of July.

      I started my day at 4:40 pm.  Yes, in the evening.  Well I guess when you go to bed at 6 am that doesn't seem so bad. Last night was a Jonaday.  I have a headache so I don't know how much I will type, but we will see where we will end. Aurora and I went to the Recher Theatre in Towson then off to Bohagers in Fells Point for a second show. Great show at Recher and it made Aurora and I realize how awful the sound on our video is.  Ok, not awful, but not great.  Curses.  Or maybe the fact that we listened to the music for more than half a day numbed our ears, but we were a little discouraged, but still all is well.  Then Bohagers for the "Rock my STyle" fashion show.  Um, I hope I don't even rock any of the styles they displayed.  I was slightly frightened.  Then back in the van.  Since Mark is cool he gets to drive our saucy van.  Damn rain.  Damn my headache.  I apologize for the brevity.  Nothing like a 2 am diner stop.  Only to be followed by a rainy jaunt in the paddocks with the horses.  Finally got to see his horse :-)   i'll write more later.  Hi Advil.

      More misadventures of Rainbow....let me just make you all aware of a simple rule...if you are creepy, don't try to pick up unsuspecting girls.  I can't tell you how many times the Rainbow girls get attacked by the creepies that stroll into the store.  We need to have an alert system.  I think I wrote about this one guy before, the one that keeps asking a different one of us out...well I was putting away cds in the overstcok boxes when I overheard that oh so familiar voice.  Jamie was the victim this time...  So in order to not be seen by him, I had to escape.  Apparently I am his favorite.  So I had to freaking crawl from the side of the store to th eback of the store where he couldn't wander just so I wouldn't be confronted.  Oh and George....  we all figured that maybe he wouldn't find us since we moved, but he did.  And he paid us a visit yesterday when we opened.  We need to prepare ourselves for George, we cannot fend for ourselves when we are barely awake.  The best plan of action for getting rid of george is just plain ignoring.  I know i know, it sounds mean, but c'mon every freaking day he stays in and bothers us for like an hour.  Oh and sexy Terry....at least you can carry on a decent conversation with Terry even though he smells and his eyebrows stick out.  He trapped Jamie and I in the rap section and proceded to tell us how nuce we looked, hey at least he is complimentary, and how if he wasn't over 60 he;d take us out. DAMN!  haha.  Raf (our manager) told us that next time we oughta start un buttoning our shirts and start touching him and stuff.  Or maybe each other.  haha.  I think he would have a heart attack right in the store! Ok, it's past 2 which means I should be at the radio station soon....

      Nate tells me that blogging should be my highest priority. Melissa, Rick, Nate and I went to see Lewis Black on Tuesday.  So freaking funny, he is one of the guys from The Daily Show with John Stewart on Comedy Central.  And I didn't appreciate the fact that they all stared at me when the opening comedien brought up something I did.  For example... Apparently I use double words a lot....such as, and I take this verbatim... "I didn't kiss him kiss him...I just kissed him".  yeah they all had a hoot.  Sometimes you just need the affirmation! :-)

      All of my days have seemed to blend together recently.  Work. Sleep. Eat. Concert.  Not all in that order and not all entirely in one day.  Especially sleep. Haha.  But again, was another day at the record store, i swear I think I have worked 10 days straight there. Don't get me wrong, I love it, but it was hard for me to figure out what day Sunday was.  Mondays adventures were a lot more enjoyable at Rainbow so I will write about that after...  Sunday...work from open to 4 pm then off to edit the jonasay tape.... 6 pm, i change into my pajamas and pack up my coffee maker because i knew that it was going to be a long night.  Dave and Aurora show up shortly after and we start the long grueling task of editing.  Ok, let me set the scene...we have about 2 hours of footage that goes onto a video cube.  This is all located in the hell that we refer to as "The White House".  This building was the President's old house that was converted into the editing rooms on the 2nd floor.  We have one room with the editors and another room with computers and a very scary bathroom.  And it smells.  We worked so hard on this video.  It's nearly perfect.  It's incredible.  around 11 pm we ran out of coffee.  11:30 the pizza came and we ate in the hallway because we couldnt stand to be anywhere tv related.  Then back to editing.  3 am came so quickly.  Then a storm.  We lost our senses shortly after that.  It was hilarious, both Aurora and I couldn't even function anymore or do menial tasks, like talk.  We figured that we should just work throughout the night to get this video done.  It was too perfect to leave alone.  At 8 am we were done and so happy we nearly cried.  nothing like listening to Jonasay for 14 hours.  More than half a day we worked on it staright.  I think we have lost our minds.  We're such dorks that we even had "favorite parts" because you know, watching for 14 hours we should have been sick of it hahaha.  Ugh and WISH.  SO that was the first clip we loaded since it was the first song.  But the editors were screwy so whenever we double clicked a certain thing, it would revert back to the first clip loaded, which was "Wish".  Wouldn't have been a problem, but everytime we expected a different song it was "Wish".  It haunted us.  And at 5 am the last thing we want to see are clips in random places where they should not be! haha.  There was even one time we werefooled...it was the audio for a different song...but oh no, the cube was too wise and underlayed the video for Wish.  That damn song hates us ;-) So yeah after the marathon and the perfect video, i went to bed at 9 am and woke up at 2 pm to go work at the music store.... It was Jen, Max, and I.  There is a reason that Raf doesn't schedule Jen and I to work together.  We made ninja stars out of old cds.  I love Rainbow.  Where else do you get paid to listen to Boston and make deadly weapons? And today...I had a fun filled day at Rainbow again :-) This time Chris was defenseless against Jamie and I.  Jamie told me I couldnt leave work this evening because I made her laugh all day. And the UPS man is on our hit list.  And no, not the hot one with the wife and kids (man, that guy can NOT keep coming into the store with his uniform on....) but this other one that sat outside of our store for like an hour with all of our cds in the back of his truck.  you cannot do that on pearl and jay z day, we had angry customers that i didnt want to deal with!  I also don't think Chris enjoyed me and Jamie serenading him.  But I do love our new store.  I thought our stalker window would be bad...the whole front of the store is now a window.  Raf caught me staring out it the other day, apparently for too long, and informed me that people can see me watching them.  Whoops!  It's like a fishbowl.  I;m a fish.  I want to be an angel fish.

      I am sooooooo sorry!  Apparently I have been disappointing my loyal FANS by not blogging more often on my misadventures.... Ok, what to hit.... JonaDAY part 2  Drove the van.  Yes, again.  See the brakes and acceleration are very sensitive...oh and mapquest sucks.  SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS! But we found the place and unloaded and thinsg were perfect.  Semi.  Until I lost communication with my crew.  I know they were talking about me ;-)  I don't even know what to write.  The filming was so incredible, I have an awesome crew.  The band is great, everything just went well.  Aurora got pulled up on stage and I thought she was going to pee herself.  As she stated "I know I had this shit eat grin on my face". Hahaha.  Oh wow, its so hard fo rme to put it into words, but I was so extremely pleased...So on the way back...hit a possum.   Hmm...Saturday I worked at the record store then edited.  Fun Fun. Sunday...Oh Sunday... sunday bloody sunday... this deserves an all new blog....

      Robert Mirabel is incredible.  I went to the Grand Opera House last night to see his performance and was deeply moved.  He incorparted rock and jazz and hip hop genres into his new age style and captivated the audience with his sheer talent.  Robert is a Native American and his entire performance displays his heritage through the instruments, dancing, and outfits.  Between songs, he told stories of his culture.  Words cannot even begin to describe the evening.

      Happy Thanksgiving :-) I am thankful for a handful of things.  And fortunately for you this will be brief because I am sleepy... I am thankful for the people that are in my life.  I am surrounded by the most honest, fun, and lovable people.  It's taken years, but I have finally found you.  My friends mean the world to me and I am so very glad they are in my life.   I am thankful for being healthy.  Both mentally and physically.  It's been a while since i have been truly happy.  Too long in fact, and this is one holiday season where I really have a clear mind without remorse or fear or depression. I am thankful for great music.  It's really a driving force and this past year has opened up many doors for me and has allowed me to expand so much and appreciate so many different styles.  It's a part of my being, not merely entertainment or distraction.  Too many people lose sight of that.  The beat goes on, whether its the drums or your heart.

      "Sometimes, I wish that I was the weather You'd bring me up in conversations forever And when it rained, I'd be the talk of the day" - john mayer  I am surrounded by the greatest friends in the world.  More on that in the next blog.... It was John Mayer day :-)  Brit got a few tickets fro John in Philly and I wasn't going to go.  I couldn't deal with the 15 year old girlies after seeing John so intimately previosly.  Michelle and I can't recall on how and when we got so jaded, but we have.  But Wednesday's performance was nothing short of incredible... Pick up Brit and Jen and Holly in NJ with no problem.  We hit the diner before heading over the river to Philly.  I think it is customary for the waitress of any diner to insert the word "honey" into every sentence.  Off to Philly, find the venue with no problem.  He played in the Temple Basketball court, though it was comparable in size to the FU center.  Sold out.  Fourth row.  Word.  But oddly it was the farthest away I have ever been.  It was Brit, Jen, and Holly's first time seeing him,so it was exciting :-) Maroon 5 were really good.  I have heard good things about them and i have played their cd in the store, but it was the first time I saw them live.  And John....played acoustically the first few songs with the opener being "Love Soon".  I do not want to give the 15 year old girlies any credit so i will not discuss them at all :-)  Then the band came out.  His setlist was incredible, old songs, new songs, and non album songs.  "City Love" right into "Covered in Rain" was amazing.  His whle performance and musicl talent was just amazing.  I think Brittany and I were the only girls in there staring at his hands instead of his face haha.  I did the whole phone thing too, I admit.  Only one song though haha.  I have never cried at a concert and the people that cry during concerts annoy me.  I beleive it was John Mayer where this girl was bawling the whole time nad I just wanted to punch her in the face and give her something to cry about.  But during the encore during "Comfortable" I almost shed a tear haha.  I held it back though.  Just the whole John Mayer/Tom thing and the past few crazy John years got to me.  And it was odd because it hadn't before.  And I will delve into that more later.  Maybe tomorrow. Now the even more fun stuff... So we parked on the fourth floor of the parking garage.  Which means 30 minutes of waiting.  Haha, the best thing was when we got into the car and trying to figure out what to listen to and Jen and Brit chose Jonasay which then Jen proceeded to say that if John and Jonasay played together it would "be the bestest concert ever".  haha yay for jen.  So then I see this guy walking and inform the car of his hotness.  They agreed.  Then a girl followed him.  Boo.  But he opened up the door for her and simultaneously we exclaimed "awwww!".  The for the next 20 minutes we hypothesized about the hot boy.  I let him pull out in front of me.  Then we decided to follow him.  Jen wrote down his license plate number.  Are you scared yet...?  We got bored so we went to McD's.   Now I know why they made me drive in the city.  As Jen put it "hey, we're not dead yet, but if I was driving we'd stil be in center city, you're a city driver."  See, you just have to be aggressive.  Cutting across traffic, cutting people off, it's all about the city life.  Some dumb butt stopped in the middle of the lane and waited.  I am not going to wait, I am going to get past him.  Silly suckers who waited patiently.  And yay for go go gadget accelerator.  No way I could have gotten my exit (without any warning no less, it just jumps at you) without swiftly driving across three lans of traffic at a turn when the light turned green.   Back to NJ then DE...bed at 3 am.

      SUNDAY "I wake up everyday, go through the same routine  Go to work, come home, what does it all really mean?" pmb  Wake up and walk to work.  One of the highlights of my day is my walk to work.  It's about a half mile and about 3 songs depending on the cd.  The familiar sights and sounds and people make it feel like home.  Too many people around here either take the town for granted or totally ignore what lies within the streets.  In ten minutes I pass the skater kids outside Switch with a flying mermaid on the wall, the tarot card man on the stone fence, and colored chalk drawings on the sidewalk.  My favorite aspect of our new store are the fishbowl windows.  For hours I can watch the town go past me.  People watching, lights changing, time passing.  The stores that surround Rainbow are like a family, we all have the same customer base and all know each other.  I can't even count how many times we have left one store to go to another while still working.  The walk to work reminds me of the secluded bubbles that too many people immerse themselves in.  And reminds me where home is.

      Saturday.... Couldn't sleep and woke up around 10 am, after going to bed around 6 am.  Since I have had the past few Saturdays off, the weekend has become my big shopping day.  It's about 20 minutes to the grocery store I usually frequent....really cheap organic, specialty, and foreign food so I make the trek...so I figured what better way to spend my Saturday than flower and food shopping.  I am sorry, Pathmark just doesn't have quite a selection in soy, falafel, and thai foods.  I also love my grocery store because of the hot older men that also shop there in the early morning.  But wait, they are mostly gay and shopping with their partners.  Oh well, it's double the looking pleasure at least.  And I found red sunflowers to brighten up my room.   After a few fun filled hours back home to enjoy a few more hours of sleep before heading to Baltimore for another Jonasay show.  My mom was going to go with me, but had gone to PA instead.  Melissa, Rick, and Epler and I braved 95.  I don't appreciate the negativety towards my vehicular skills less than five minutes after they get in the car.... So we get to where the venue is but need to find parking.  After we passed the adult movie theatre (XXX Adult Film Hits $2) with a hearse (1972 era) in front of it and the Gun & Pawn shop (trade in your bling for a bang...) (hehehe I just came out with that witty remark ;-) ) we found a space.  At least we were wearing our neutral gang colors. I was kinda hesitant to go in, for I was quite uncertain of my previous nights endeavors....but all was well :-)  Fiesta Red. And driving home...no one was on the road, I was going 80, not fast for 95 north.  Pass a state cop, I brake.  He pulls out, follows me, then lights flare.  I'm scared shitless.  Charise and I talk about what we would say if we ever got pulled over, but yeah, all of that wen't completely out the window when the cop came over.  I got away with a warning.  yay.  I think it was because I have a clean driving record (shut up, thats not too surprising!) and I was wearing my glasses (i dont have any restrictions), he didn;t smell alcohol, and we all had our seatbelts on.  Yay for the little things. Drive home, go to bed.

      Oh geez, I have not blogged in a while.... "I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been..." -john mayer  I guess I will start in chronological order....I have been horrible at this lately...so a new blog for every exciting day...  Let's go into the time machine to Friday...  Off to Arlington, VA to see another Jonasay show.  I'm laughing at myself just thinking about writing the misadventures of that evening.  First off, we got lost.  Imagine that, me driving and not getting from point A to point B obstacle free.  A novelty. Get to the wonderful Iota and it was packed which was great.  Hello vodka and coke.  Great great great show, the best one I have seen them put on so far.  I really have a lack of color commentary when i write about an event a week later.  Bear with me.  Aurora was in SC and we did the whole cell ohone thing during a concert.  No one did that five years ago and now everytime I go to a show there is at least one person holding up their cell phone during at least one song.  It's like an added person at the venue.  A call saying "i wish you were here and now you are".  Now that I think about it, I beleive I do that a lot.  I wonder if I look like a dork.  I just sat here for a few minutes trying to recollect the first time I did the phone concert thing and remembered when Nate called me and held up his phone so I could hear the radio in LA.  I believe he was in a pool hall and John Mayer was on the radio, well, before he was on the radio now.  That was a first.  Mobile to mobile radio experience.  So yeah a few drinks later....see, I haven't really drink drank drunk a lot lately, one factor being time, the other money.  So here is where the embarrassment begins....I don't quite remember all of it, just slight recollections, so here we go.... I had to give Michael two copies of their Center Stage video, but after the show I looked in bag and found no videos.  SO I tell him that I have no idea where the videos went.  He then informs me that I already gave them to him after the show.  After the show?  What the hell, it was just after teh show and I defnitely didn't give them to him.  But he said I did, so I must have, but where did those minutes go.....?  I don't even know how long this ordeal lasted, but I kept showing Justin my striped socks and talked to Mark about various forms of wildlife.  Mark told me that he most enjoyed when I staggered towards him saying that I wasn't driving.  No, really...? :-)  At another point, I handed Aurora my phone where Justin proceeded to tell her that I was "fucked up and never saw that side of me before".  Haha.  Hmmm I am sure that if anything esle comes back to me, I will inform you.... Onwards to the parking garage!  Did you know that parking garages in Arlington close at 2:30 am?  Yeah, well we didn't.  I told the security gaurd in my drunkeness how we were from Delaware and not there and HAD to get out.  I guess he obliged.  I remember riding in the elevator and getting off on the wrong floor and running to not my car... Babbled in the car a lot, I tend to do that, at least it's semi coherent bablle when I am sober, when i am drunk I think its more like aimless sleep talk.  Then I pass out.   Hello Newark and the sunrise.

      damn, its been yet another 60 minutes.  I cant tell you what happened between there and here. My eyes are burning though and I have been leaning on my left arm for way to long so now that side of my body is numb and I am kinda contorted on this chair.  Which  I have managed to save myself from falling off it several times now.  I am atop of a metal and carpet floor here in the radio station and going from the computer to the cd players I push off the counter and wheel my chair across the room.  Unfortunately I have to cross the threshold of the metal plate and carpet.  Nearly tumbling to the ground everytime.  But I haven't.  I did lose my shoes about 35 minutes ago though.  They are somewhere in the hallway. SO I made coffee.  No, I heated up coffee.  In our microwave that is from 1987.  I hope I don't start glowing green from the nuclear waves.  But my mug would not fit into the small confinement of the energy box.  So I found a cubelike container that fit.  I had sugar.  But nothing to stir it with.  Ah. My pen.  And I think it slightly melted.   Speaking of fun with heat.  So I learned that cardboad does not belong in the oven.  The hard way.  Well the other day, Melissa, Karen, and I ordered pizza.  We later decided we wanted to heat it back up so I took control over the kitchen.  I just took the Papa John's box and placed it in the oven at 350 degrees.  Yeah, about 15 minutes later we smelled somehting burning.  I thought it was perfectly fine to take the box out of the oven, wile Karen and Melissa started yelling at me.  It makes sense.....its like a little incubator.  Who knew you couldn't place paper in almost fire.  So last night I made one of those frozen pizzas that have the cardboard on the bottom.  But see, its ok because I didnt realize that there was cardboard on the bottom, so I totally was not at fault.  So yeah about 20 minutes into it, i smell something burning, but just ignore it.  Shortly after the smoke detector goes off.  What the hell.  The kitchen is smoke, of course.  Look in the oven, take the unburnt pizza out...then find my culprit.   come on, its been a while since i have had a kitchen misadventure, it was about time for a new one.

      almost an hour later.... i am listening to the new Nada Surf album now.  They're playing with Sondre Lerche.  Not on the albu, on tour.  I want to see that show.  Speaking of shows.  Ah, the Saint in Asbury.  What a cute little club.  Small, intimate venue that is very receptive of orginal bands.  Gotta love that.  And the staff was so extremely nice.  Saw Green to Think and Graham Colton, two amazingly wonderful bands.  I have been a fan of GC for quite a while now and finally got to see a full live performance. yay.  Maybe I will own my own venue.  After I win the lottery.  Haha, I just remembered when Miss Jen, Aurora, and Jim and I went to Ben Folds.  We like to play the game "in my venue..."  Of course it would be named Mirandaland ;-)  Complete with a Ferris Wheel.  Hahaha I just remembered.....on the way to Asbury, in the beginning on the trip on 273 I was aggravated by traffic and I casually told Aurora and Tessa that when I have my own country all major highways will be ten lanes.  Aurora said that that was the first time she ever heard that phrase uttered.  Again, it would be named Mirandaland ;-).  I was about to compile a list of things we say that probably are never uttered, but then again, I have to stop myself because this site has become way too big and too many people are looking over my shoulder haha.  I know I have lost my dignity numerous times lately, but there needs to be a gatekeeper.  Two more hours and I am doing fiiiinnnnneeeee.

      Ahhhh...lovely WVUD doing an overnight here from midnight to 6am and thought I would check in.  Have the coffee and donuts.  God, I love this industry :-) Maybe I will write in every hour just to keep my sanity haha.  Nothing like a spontaneous drive to Asbury Park last night, only to get to bed at 6 am and wake up at noon and to broadcast till 6 am.  Sleep is such a luxory these days haha.  It really isn't necessary.  A caffeine IV does just fine.   So I am doing the good old apartment search right now.  Debating in staying in Newark and living in the apartments connected to my record store...haha yes, I could wake up ten minutes prior to starting the work day...or just heading to the Baltimore/DC area.  Is it time for me to find a practical job already!?!?!

      Aurora and I apparently picked something up at the Hilton.  And she didn't drink from the Captain.  haha but now we both have raspy throats.  Hahaha.  We took one for the team. It's going to reach nearly 70 in Wilmington NC this week.  Sweet.  While Delaware is freezing with be soaking up some semi-rays. I told Karen that I just need to keep a packed bag next to my door.  Kind of like what pregant women door.  So that if I am in a rush, I can just grab it on the way out.  Filled with all the necessities, such as clothes, toothbrush, underwear, and a poof.  Can't forget the poof.

      Damn the snow plows.  Everyone in my apartment complex is pretty much plowed in.  I love where I live.  First off, whenever snow falls, usually you see cute little snowmen or snow forts.  nope, not here.  Here you see snow porn.  It's amazing the art you can create with snow.  And getting cars out is another story.  We usually don't get enough snow to justify purchasing a shovel, until now.  So we must get creative on how to get cars out.  Brittany had a BYOB party to get Peebur out...Bring Your Own Bowl.  That didn't last long.  This morning I saw everything from trashcans to pots to brooms to shovel out the trapped vehicles.  My favorite was the group of guys using a keg bucket to scoop away the snow.  Fine work boys. So after being trapped for two days, I needed some more music.  As if all the cds I came away with from the MMC wasn't enough.  Here is what I picked up from my store....went in to pick up cds and ended up working a few, gotta love Rainbow :-)  This is what I got... USED: The Beatles- Past Masters One, The Beatles -Past Masters Two, The Cars -Greatest Hits, The Police -Ghost In The Machine, Seeking Homer -Paradise (I know I know, I have had this disk since it came out, but it snapped right in half!) NEW: Jesse Malin - The Fine Art of Self Destruction, Virginia Coalition - Rock and Roll Party, Brendan Benson - Lapalco

      PART 1 ok, this was all out of order, now its in order.... Well well well, not even sure where to begin....one of the best weekends ever is coming to an end....and I still consider this Monday night as a part of the weekend since the Blizzard of Oh Three has kept me captive inside... and of course keep in mind that i have no idea who is reading these and it pains me to have not be as detailed :-D  Aurora and I had the pleasure of using a Durango during the trip, in which I quickly named the "Go Go Durango".  I refrained from using an Aussie accent.  And after all this time we are still speaking to each other and she hasn't killed me yet, haha.  We stop on the way up to Harrisburg for coffee and pizza.  Coffee and cigarettes (besides music) are our main addictions and we defnitely could not have survived the weekend without them.   "Cigarettes and chocolate milk These are just a couple of my cravings Everything it seems I like's a little bit stronger A little bit thicker, a little bit harmful for me" rw So we make it to the Hilton without getting lost, which is an incredible feat.  Finding parking, on the other hand, was more adventurous.  So we go to the check in counter.  As people came in for the conference, they gave out the rooms, so we heard the two counter people discuss where to put us and whether "should we put them there?!?!" to which Aurora and I reply "YES! Put us there!" seeing how whatever they were talking about was sure to be interesting.  So they laugh and gave us room 521.  It's all about the numbers.  We got off on exit 19, which is Aurora's favorite number, and room 521, if you add all together (5+2+1) equals 8, which is my favorite number....yeah.  So we go in, drop our stuff off, do a squeal, jump up and down...oh wait, that was me.  Aurora told me to calm myself.  We go downstairs and in the meantime I call Phil (from Lloyd Dobler Effect...there are going to be a lot of names, so I will do my best to identity them) and I leave a message saying where we are.  I then call everyone else who we know will be there to tell them what room number we are.  Phil then calls back saying that the band is in 520.  No fucking way.  Way.  So we partially unpack and meet up with Mark (from Jonasay) to hit up some shows.  Aurora was unable to get into the Gingerbread Man so we walk back to the Hilton.  She lights up and goes on on why she hates her parents for not getting it on earlier so she can get in places.  So two guys and a girl (wasn't that a tv show...?) come out of the Hilton, talk to us, hands us a CD and tells us to come to their show. I ask if Aurora can get in, they say "sure, she can carry a box".  So off we went into the van.  The kidnappers were Tim, Michael, and Jen from mellowheadblue and were great great people from good old Arlington VA.  Jen boosted up my confidence in possibly moving out there.  It's so very strange how everyone that I have encountered lately has been all connected in some sort of way.  Folded Under, also from Virginia, was next.  Oddly we had just missed Phil there while we waited for Mark outside.  Mark then kidnapped us, and we went to the Firehouse to see Fighting Gravity.  Ran into Michael Sauri (Cinema 8) and surprisingly he wasn't too cool to talk to us ;-) .  Off to the pizza place with scary drunk people.  Then back to the Hilton.  Thursday was low-key since not much was going on.  Go back upstairs and Mark decided to see if LDE was really next door.  Aw yeah they were.  Aurora and I knew that this weekend would definitely not be the same now....A few later, it was Aurora, Mark, Phil, and I talking in our room witnessing Phil's drunkeness.  The night before, the girls of 5208 had decided to make cookies and well, we kinda miscalculated so I had an abundance of baked goods, so I brought them with me.... Ok, my inability to cook deserves its own new paragraph...So we had made cookies and I had brought cookies.  But see...yeah I am not that adept in the kitchen as we all know from my misadventures.  So we didn't have table salt, but I had sea salt.  Hey, it's all the same, right?  Nah....seal salt really doesn't dissolve or mix well, so the whole cookie eating was made entertaining by salt surprises in the cookies.  Ok, back to another paragraph... So yeah we're all just talking being entertained by Phil's devouring and leaving cookie messes everywhere.  It's soon 3 am and Mark leaves and Aurora and I walk him down to the lobby.  She smokes, then we head to the elevators.  On the way, this group approaches us, and it wouldn't have been as intimidating if they weren't two inches from us the whole time.  They won't leave us alone then the security guard come sup, and they still won't leave.  Then Mark comes in to save the day since he left his cell upstairs.  Disaster averted.  Yeah, still around 3am.  Aw yeah, Rusty (LDE) comes to visit.  Then Phil ventures back and uses our bathroom.  We had free trial sized stuff in the bathroom and we noticed that half the mouthwash was gone and wefound it odd that he went to use the bathroom and then the mouthwash disappears.  He wou'dnt fess up ;-) oh but we know.....  4:30am rolls around and we decide we need to get some sleep since the early morning shows are starting to air.  As we're trying to go to sleep we hear knocking from next door (LDE's room) so we do the knocking back and forth thing for an hour.  This was the start of the knocking and the sharing.  The whole weekend 520 and 521 were pretty much just one room and just barged in whenever and used everyones stuff and whenever we wanted to play with the other we just knocked.  or if we wanted to wake them up.  or bother them.  anything really haha. Set the alarm for 11 am but nooooo at 10:30am a certain someones cell phone goes off and all we hear is Rusty.  Damn him and lack of sleep!  Javi (LDE) comes in our room shortly after.  Did we even lock the door that night?!  Wearing the same clothes as the night before.  So the three of us are talking then decide to go downstairs to the lobby.  Aurora and I both still wearing what we wore to bed.  Nothing like looking half dead at noon in the Hilton lobby in our pajamas amidst a bunch of professionals in business attire. Yeah.  For some reason all I carry with me downstairs is my cell and Hilton card.  Not expecting a phone call, Phil calls.  "mirandaaaaaaaaaa can i shower at your place?!".  Go upstairs and he is waiting in hallway.  Hilarious.  Blah Blah Blah, we all get ready then go downstairs for breakfast...I think at this point its about 2 pm.  Food takes too long so we play with breadsticks.  The Real Torino.  They take too damn long so we go to the Neato Burrito.  Ahh yeah, anything named the Neato Burrito has got to be excellent.  And it was.  The Game Players: Aurora, Me, Rusty, Jessica (friend of LDE and we (me and Aurora) kidnapped her as our own), Phil, Jen (LDE promo/merch/all around girl), and Todd (more music group promotions) had a wonderful culinary experience. Haha.  Avoid the nachos and buy lots of Snapple.  Where the hell did Javi escape to?!  After lunch, Rusty, Jessica, Aurora, and I hit up the panels and talked to lots and lots of people and got fun stuff.  It was great meeting some people who I knew by name and not by face.  Signal Fading is a great great resource that everyone should check out and embrace.  Off and on we met up with the LDE crew before we decided that it was time to go back to the rooms.  Impromptu practice session in 520.  Donnie was either asleep or on the phone the whole time.  We love how he never talks unless he is on the phone....Rusty, Jessica, and I go out and get reinforcements....cigarettes, alcohol, and poofs.  The three of us (girls that is) all seemed to have forgotten our poofs at home.  Poofs are a necessity.   Come back, all just chill in our room, talking and getting ready.  I took a shower and notice that the mouthwash is now in the shower.  Phil and the mouthwash...whats the deal?!?! Haha.  See, there is a rule, and usually it's "you can see us before we get ready and after we get ready, but you're not allowed to see the transformation".  Nothing like having everyone come in and out and Rusty and Javi and Rod chilling with us as we're trying to straighten hair, find clothes, and put on makeup.  No offense and no hard feelings, it was just funny :-) Then we leave for the Crowne Plaza... and i must start a new page, break this piece up ;-) PART 2 So yeah.... We leave to go see Capitol Air at the Crowne Plaza who put on a very good performance with their new tunes.  Forgot to mention that Aurora and I ran into CA at the club the night before, so out of 30 venues and 300 bands it was cool to randomly run into them and hang out for a bit.  Matt (CA) had snazzy new blonde hair.  Walk around....we decide to go grab food before the next round of shows, so we find a chinese restaraunt.  So we go in and order and we find it odd that on a Friday night we're the only ones in there.  Oh wait...because it was Valentine's Day.  Oh Geez. Hahaha.  Off to more shows in the cold...... LDE at the Crowne Plaza.  They looked extremely nervous and despite various sound issues sounded good and pulled off some new stuff.  And the duct taped banner stayed up! :-)  There was a huge turnout and I saw some very obvious positive reactions.  Left to go see Jonasay while Aurora checked out more stuff.  Even if it was slightly frightening.... Jonasay played at Gullifty's and of course that venue is always behind and they went on about an hour late.  They looked exhausted.  Oddly Justin had a friend also from DE.  Sound issues for them as well, so hey, at least the MMC was being fair about it ;-).  Stayed to watch Pepper's Ghost from Philly.  Throughout the past few four years I have seen them in various places.  Same sound, same show.  Nothing bad, but nothing great.  A little after 2am I leave for the Hilton again...and this is where the fun begins....after hours and hours of seeing shows and networking, it's time to let loose and have some fun... So I arrive at the Hilton and run up to the room and pass a million people.  Drop the stuff off, grab the camera, the Captain in one hand, Coors Light in the other...it's time to party.  So everyone at the conference is pretty much on floors 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.  The part was on the fourth floor.  Yes, I said floor.  not rooms, but just in the hallways.  Aurora, Jess, and I were mainly together with April (one of the girls who worked the conference), and Rusty,  Everyone was just in the hallways talking and drinking and having a great time.  All sorts of musicians and industry people and it was wonderful just to have such a basis with everyone.  the party was also in the elevators as we went from floor to floor.  We saw one guy with nipple rings and a banner as a daiper, some canadiens, and a very happy graphic designer among others.  We try to find javi so we yell "Javi" all up and down the floors until we think we hear him and Jess discovers that she hears him in the elevator haha.  The one thing about Javi is everyone knew who he was.  Everyone know who LDE was so that was very awesome for him.  Blah blah blah, hanging out on the floors...then we go upstairs to the 5th floor.  Oh yeah, we all have this on video as well as film.... We run into Rusty and Ken (Heat), and a few other guys then they errupt in some free style hip hop/rapping for a while.  This was awesome.  We sat there for like 30 minutes just watching them create new beats and lyrics.  Spontaneity was the essence of this conference.   Aurora runs back to the room which was right in front of the freestylin' corner and comes back and exclaims that no where else in this hotel smells like weed except for in the 520/521 wing.  That is on film too. Again we wander the floors.  I have the Captain with me.  The Captain, like Andrea L., was a dirty dirty whore.  If anyone had mono in the Hilton, then we all have mono since i think every single person on floors 4 and 5 drank out of the bottle. Around 4:30ish we come back to Aurora and my room....where it's let's see, out of the people we knew...me, Aurora, Jess, April, Ken, Rusty, Javi, Rod, and random guys.  Talking talking drinking drinking blazing blazing.  "JAM SESSION!!!!"  All of a sudden we have guitars, congas, a violin, and amps in our room.  And there is a mini show and jamming and talking and just greatness for a while.   Around 5:30ish Steve, Ken, and Dave from Green To Think come in with Gilligan.  All with some Yuengling.  This is why they are great.  So yeah, we're all chilling then the room starts clearing out around 6:30 except for Aurora, Ken, Steve, and me.  Something about Elephant Games (which Aurora had to remind me of today since I had no idea what she was talking about) haha.  So the four of us spent some time hanging out, making fun, and talking.  Trying to finish up a music crossword puzzle proved difficult.  I havent even looked at it yet, maybe I should to see the craziness.  Saturday morning cartoons starting coming on.  Then we realized that it was past 7 am.  Time flys by when you're having a great time :-).  Haha we told Steve he better watch out on the message board..... ;-) So then they turn off the lights and tuck us in...star sheet!?!? and it's 7:30am.  They leave. Aurora and I talk.  We see that we still have congas, amps, and a violin in our room.  She gets up and needs a cigarette but can't find a lighter.  "all i need is something that fucking makes fire!" bed time : after 7:30 am wake up: 10:30 am thanks to our wonderful neighbors :-P  another blog to finish it up.... PART 3 You should be reading these in order! So we wake up to the bustling of the LDE next door.  Knock knock knock.  We're dead.  And Hilton coffee isn't that strong. Good byes are rough. But off to see some more music. 4 more bands. I think we went babysitting.  Never before have I felt so old.  I hope I never acted like a stupid 15 year old girl at a concert.  Stupid 22 year old girl is more adequate ;-) hahaha.  I love how when Jen, Brit, Holly, and I went to see John Mayer last our ages slowly reverted as the night progressed haha. So needless to say we were cranky, obnoxious, and tired.  But once Graham Colton went on, we awakened. The whole conference all of LDE, except for Donnie I think haha, informed us how Graham Colton is NOasis.  It is too sad to even write.  But as we listened we heard the "inklings" of other songs in some of GC's work.  We won't let the man get us down. Then Justin (Jonasay) comes up to us.  What the heck?!   But GC put on a great show, not as good as Asbury, but a good setlist to an energetic crowd.  And after the show, oddly Spare Dimes was playing. Hung around for a bit, then headed home. SOOOO SLEEPY! Hit the bed around 4 am. Thank you Blizzard of Oh Three.  ok ok ok i have a part 4  So when we checked into the Hilton, they gave us the "Rules and Regulations" this will shortly be on my site (www.mirandaland.com), but in the meantime...   "Posters, flyers and stickers are not permitted to be distributed or placed around the hotel" hahaha yeah right! I think the town of H-burg was definitely littered that weekend and LDE was probably responisble for most of that! Those rebels....   "MMC7 and the Hilton willnot tolerate the defacing, damage, or destruction of the property or premises of the hotel or conference venues" - after the security people realizes that they were outnumbered, they left us alone and ogled at the hoodlum that was occuring. we have a picture of the security people holding broken stuff.   "Use common courtesy towards all hotel guests, especially late at night" - nothing like a good v-day ruckus

      so Jen wrote this today and I figure I will let you read and I will comment on it because it relates to what i was going to write about....  Tuesday, February 25, 2003 Posted 3:41 AM by Jen  Producers learn never to take anything for granted. Having enough people to operate a show for instance, is never a given. Tonight we had five people as crew and two of them had to be on camera at times. You never take equipment working for granted. Even the most simplistic of machines, like a VCR, could spaz out at any moment and leave you as helpless as if you had no cameras at all. They decided to freak out tonight, with 7 minutes until show we discovered they weren't taping video and by luck Whitney noticed a switch was in a different spot on one vcr than the other. However, we couldn't get it to stop playing spastically as if it needed tracking, which we didnt know how to fix. Andy had to go on air and apologize after the commercial breaks for anyone that just had a seizure due to the flashing colors and moving picture. Most importantly, you never take time for granted. I remember Miranda had a blog ages ago saying that since time is such a priority in production that she tended to see her life in a countdown, like she had 38 minutes until class, and 2 to get dressed in and 4 to eat in and so on. Kinda like how Will saw everything as units of time in About a Boy, but I won't go into that again :) I missed the lesson on managing time, but I think I have an appreciation for it of some sort. I hate going to bed because there's so many other productive things I could be doing, but I treasure my 1.29 hours of naptime if I ever get them. An hour wait for food means an hours worth of social time before hand. Maybe its not the time I'm concerned with, maybe its the rationalization of it. I can rationalize not doing anything for that hour because I'm waiting for food. I can rationalize taking a nap because I didn't get much sleep the night before, which I can rationalize by saying staying up late was worth it because I got to write in my blog or talk to Scott or look at that website or play that game that I normally woudln't have had the time for. It sucks to get in an argument with me because I can rationalize anything in the world. I can rationalize the fact that the show didn't go as smoothly as we all would have liked because it wasn't my fault the vcr's turned schizo on us and we worked through the setbacks to put out a good show. Because in a year, no one's going to remember the technical problems we had, they'll just remember the manatee wanted to have sex with Andy, and in the end, that's all that matters...  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Well first off, my OCD would only allow me to count down anything with a zero or five, but besides that... it is true, working with television and radio, everything is a countdown and it all has to do with numbers.  Everything is perfectly timed.  In all aspects.  It always reminds me of the movie Castaway...."We live by the clock and we die by the clock".  Numbers are all too important to me.  And I guess it just goes with me nature of packing all of my day with something.  Anything.  Epler pointed out that I "don't deal with with being idle" haha.  It's been like that for years.  Sleep is only a luxury because there is just too much to get done, enjoy, and experience.  I rarely know what the word "downtime" means.  I guess that is why I was so glad to actually get that snow storm, my life was forced to take a break.  Which is my perfect segway into my weekend....Don't have any regrets and use up your time to the fullest extent.... So I had some free time from work so Aurora and I decided to go to.....NORTH CAROLINA!   We left rainy cold Delaware at noon on Sunday.  From DE to North Carolina there are ONLY 3 signs for a Wawa at the exit.  And all are around Richmond.  There are two after Richmond.  Sadness!  We get to UNCW to visit Sean around 8:30 that night.  Go out to eat and hang out and fall asleep around 5am.  Aurora and I have been sick since Harrisburg (damn, was that ONLY a week ago!?!?!?!) so the coughing and sneezing and rough voices were quite appealing I'm sure.  We leave for Carrboro in the evening.  Jonasay and Graham Colton.  See we had to go, how often would they be playing together?!?!  I had my voice while Aurora had a sexy rendition of hers which didn't allow her to whisper very well so it was difficult to talk about people or make fun of anyone without being obvious.  But I think we succeeded.  Aside from Michael and his vagueness it was a very fun night.  We'll figure this one out...... Leave at 2 am to come back home to Delaware.  I taught Aurora stick shift so we could switch off.  After stopping at a random gas station filling up on coffee and Mountain Dew, I caught my second wind near Richmond and kept on going.  Cruise control is a very nice thing to have.  Saw the skies change from night to day and it reminded me on how much I love driving and being out while everything else is asleep.  Haha actually the last time one of those instances stick out is after I was at the beach in July with Jonasay and trekking on the beach...odd how everything comes around full circle.  Hit rush hour traffic in DC around 5:30 am.  Two sleeping cranky girls does not make the roadways safe!  Damn people.  Accident in Baltimore.  Made it home by 8 am.   Stuff we listened to on the trip, for your inquisitive mind: Beatles, Jesse Malin, Jonasay, Brendan Benson, Howie Day, Virginia Coaltion, Green to Think, Better Than Ezra, Pat McGee Band, ok, i forget the others...grrrr 1030 miles...45 hours...whew!

      chicks flicks and pizza  that somes it up...though we never got around to the movie :-)  Brittany, Aurora, Whitney, Karen, and I got to finally hang out outside of the television studio and catch up and relax.  Haven't heard that word for a while.  I swear the conversations we get into.  And its great to see how such different people can get a long so well and have a great time.  Though we're all sick and tired and worn out and water logged, we kept it going till the wee hours of the morning.  In a few hours I will be heading off to North Carolina.  I'm sure the misadventures will land up on here.  Last night hung out with Melissa, Rick, and Chris at the East End.  The good old East End.  Definitely one of my favorite places in Newark.  Didn't think I drank that much, till I came home and hung out with natalie.  See Cari later on... "so did you have fun last night?  All i heard was a "woo" from you when you walked in and I knew it was a good night.  Then I rolled over and went back to bed". argh...it's times like this that makes my impending move to DC seem so hard.  In time answers will come....  But now, time to sleep this sickness away!

      I found the two greatest food products on Earth. Ever.  EVER. Go Bananas Snapple Juice Beverage & Pop Secret Honey Butter Popcorn. And you know what the glorious thing about the Snapple is!? That I have only found it in various Wawa's....Philly...Newark...Virginia.   Wawa is wonderful in so many ways.  For one...the vast assortment of Snapple.  Free ATM.  Cheap-o gas.  Coffee.  Clean bathrooms.  Wawa is most definitely the Mecca of every trip.  The southern most Wawa is right outside of Rishmond.  See, you get a little frightened because for a while, you do not see signs for Wawa off of 95, then right before Richmond, there is one.  Then you get back on 95 and once you thought you would be leaving Wawa until your arrving trip, there are three more after Richmond.   You see how often I drive.

      Aurora says this: "I think i'm getting stupider.  It's the station; they always said Television kills brain cells....Watching television is like standing near a microwave, and working at a station is like getting into the microwave" I spent 14 hours today working, for the most part, on television related activity.  We ended the night off right by getting our usualy Margherita's pizza and watching tv and talking.  Margherita's is hands down the best pizza ever.  Screw you corporate pizza.  And again, after spending hours at the tv station, we find ourselves still talking about...mostly...television.  It's a sick sick cycle.   And it's bitter cold outside.  Damn you Spring, get here quicker.  We all pile into the car after and sat on my ice cubes of seats.  Aurora told Brittany to sit up staright because then it would be as if she was dancing to the music and not really shivering.

      Wow, Brittany has been so good about blogging everyday.  While I, on the other hand, am not as diligent.   Saturday was exciting.  Brittany made a new word....she claimed her arms and back hurt from all this "IKEtasticness".  You and your dirty mind, we're talking about filming. Friday night Brittany and I ordered pizza and watched the U2 Elevation tour DVD and caught up with all of "projects". "I can't live with or without you..." wow. I have such an awesome crew working on Center Stage.  And I bet you are all wondering how Saturday turned out. We were to film Ike (www.ikeonline.net) at the Northstar bar in Philly for their cd release party.  We usually have a van or a Liberty or a Durango to haul all of our gear in.  Not this time, I was notified that all vehicles that we usually use were taken, so time to use Aurora's Cherokee again.  Last time we packed that thing up was the Lloyd Dobler Effect show.  So Aurora and I woke up at the crack of dawn...ok, ok, ten am is  really  early!  We head out of Newark for Murderkill to pick up the Cherokee.  Yes, Aurora technically lives in Murderkill ;-).   I swear I need to grab hold of my anxiety.  We loaded up with everything we needed and headed over to Wendy's for the ritualistic prefilming dinner.  Let me introduce the players...Aurora, Brittany, Eduardo, Epler, Rob, and myself.  Jen and Scott were to meet us at the venue.  After the slight panic of me not having my glasses...do I ever remember everything...we hit the road to PA.  Brit and I listened to U2 on the way up and talked about her bluntness and honesty.  I give her so much credit and she has my utmost respect for blatantly telling a certain someone how she feels and what she thinks.  So many people are so hesitant.  Way to go Brittany. I think time stopped while we were driving to Philly because we got there in about 30 minutes, a half hour before we needed to be there.  I don't think going 95 on 95 had anything to do with it.  Got to the venue and loaded in with record time.  Things were going all too smoothly for me to be unconcerned haha.  Epler stayed at the venue to sleep while the five of us (Rob, Eduardo, Aurora, Birttany, and me) went to find a Wawa.  Oh come on, you couldn't expect a roadtrip without a Wawa stop could you?!  Coffee and subs later, we were waiting in the Cherokee while we watched Jen and Scott drive past us 5 times.  Finally we met up at the venue.   We had about an hour to kill and we were parked on a shady street in Philadelphia.  It was too cramped in the Cherokee so we loiter outside on 27th Street.  brittany was scared so she stayed inside the vehicle.  She decided she wanted to join us, but when she opened the door, the alarm went off, with all of Philly's finest to witness.  Nothing like bringing attention to ourselves.  So 7 of us are cold and all want to fit inside the Cherokee now so we unflod the seat and climb in. I can't belevie we sat like that for almost an hour.  Out of all the random conversations that occured, Eduardo's was the best... Brittany mentioned that in the Census, Hispanics were considered "caucasion" and were not such a minority anymore and stats show that Hispanics will soon be the majority.  Eduardo then pipes in saying he agrees.  He said that they are such devout Catholics and do not beleive in birth control.  Also the young drinking age and cluture also contribute to the rising Hispanic numbers and that they are slowly taking over and to watch out.  He was quite proud.  It was hilarious. So we go and film to a nicely packed Northstar Bar.  The production went so very well and I am so proud of everyone working on it.  It meant the most when I saw a crowd watching my monitors rather than the stage. Stuck around for a little bit after the show, then loaded up and headed out.  Missed the exit for 95 and took a nice little tour of Philly.  A group of guys in tuxedos ran past my car, then turned around and blew kisses at Brittany and I.  What was going on?!!? It was oddly strange.  Then in Newark, the same thing happened again.  It was oddly weird.  Not bad, just funny.  Aurora calls me up, she is still right behind me, and asks what the heck Brit and I were doing haha.  Then I almost hit someone. Everyone invloved in the production was great, from the crew to the venue to the band to the management.  Thank you.

      And the next weekend....Jonasay played at the Logan House.  So the crew all comes and a good time is had by all.  I swear these would be longer if I actually wrote them on time!  Key players: me, Michelle, Nate, Karen, Tim, Jesse, Wade.....  Upstairs downstairs drinks upstairs shots downstairs.  Whew.  There was one victory...I think this is the first time I have came home from the Logan House remembering how I got home and not throwing up.  yay.  Hang out with the guys after.  Found Mark after he disappeared and we watched "the others" get thier mack on.  Entertaining.  We leave.  Justin and Mike crashed at my place since they were playing up in Philly the next night.  the guitar was busted out, as well as some gymnastics action.  Too much to even write.  I threw away piles of beer cans in the morning.  And i think Justin is th eonly one who drank them haha.  Wake up, eat breakfast at noon at the East End.  Drama at the breakfast table.  Show is now acoustic.  Problem solved, on the road to Philly.  Stuck in traffic.  I'm sitting in the back of the van and I look up and I see a Green To Think sticker above my head.  Small world.  Not that many band stickers in their van, just venues, so go figure.  We were heading to NXNW in Philly for their show with Sister Hazel.  Cute place.  Suzanne and I walked around fun filled Germantown Ave.  Show starts, took a bunch of pictures (which did not turn out AT ALL since my battery died).  Head out with Brooke and a drunken Mark.  :-) Go to a Wawa, of course.  Cause a ruckus, of course.  Get lost, of course.  Head home.  Only to take a "nap" then head to DC the next morning.

      A few weeks after that, the Center Stage crew went to Philly to film Green to Think at Doc Watson's.  I lose the van keys, multiple times.  But we do our usually Wendy's run then 95.  Scott and Marissa were able to join us this time and witness the chaos that is my life haha.  We had to park the vans behind the venue, which wouldn't have been a problem if the driveway wasn't 5 feet wide and our vans being a whopping 5 foot 1 inch wide.  but we made it thru no problems....yet.  We load in and set up in record time.  Damn I love to CS crew :-)  We filmed an awesome show, despite some sound difficulties.  We had a pretty hilarious interview.  Either they clam up or spill all, and we defnitely got the better end of the bargain :-)  Of course I couldn't hear a damn word they said, so I just waited till they all looked at me.  A lot of vagueness was revealed...hmmmmm.    But you all will have to wait till its done and airs :-) So we head home.  After about 20 minutes of trying to get OUT of the narrow driveway.  head home.....then Aurora hits a critter.  I swear, is nothing sacred!?  We broke a van and there was puffs of fur and blood on the bumper.  No one would let me film it.   But all in all a great night, from good times to GTT to good friends to road trips.

      Hahaha so in addition to that last story, both Lauren and I had remembered that date, April 5 as being the PMB show in Newark three years before.  It was like a reunion.  Ok, how many times have I writen that!?!? So I think her and I were the only ones who remember that whole day starting with traant, then the parking lot, then Deer park then the parking lot again.  And beer,  beer through a straw...beer in a pitcher...beer being dumped on people......damn time flies.

      Let's see what else happened...oh yeah, so a few days later....  Aurora and I drive up to Fords, NJ to see Finch do an instore at Vintage Vinyl.  We get there and its swamped, so we decide not to stay.  Pat McGee Band was playing in Princeton which was on the way home, so we decided to stop there as well.  took us about an hour to find out where they were playing, but we found it and snuck in.  Chardy found me immediately and it was bittersweet.  And Lauren!!!!!  Lauren is great, I met her a few years ago at Ursinus.  her and I will ALWAYS be PMB dorks.  She stood next to me at a show a few years ago and we started talking and we realized that we had both gone to UD.  So we started going to some shows together.  the famous PMB Deer Park stop involved Lauren as well ;-) If you see any pictures on my site with myself in it, more than likely, Lauren is in them as well.  We have run into each other occasionally in the past year, but hadn't scheduled any shows.  Ironically she is good friends with Michelle's boufriend Jason and we all last spent Homecoming together.  So Lauren was tehre and she snuck in too and it was odd.  So we go up and I swearl it was like Ivy Girls Gone Wild.  Princeton girls should not drink.  Ever.  because they cannot hold their alcohol and they become lesbianesque and bothersome.  I guess i am being hypocritical, but for PMB shows, I always LOATHED the drunken assholes at the shows and could never understand why people would want to drink so much at the show and not enjoy it.  But of course, if you are a loyal reader and have read about my escapades at the Logan House, you see that I am being contradictory.  I do stupid shit, but I don't think i have ever been so shitfaced that I am an utter asshole.  or at least, when I am, haha, i am not in the front few rows of a show.  I am in the back not bothering the people up front.  There, that being said, i wil continue.  And they ended with "Where the Streets have No Name".  it was amazing and I ate my words.  there has been a lot of word eating lately.  I didn't exactly boycott PMB, but the change in music, the subtraction of AL and Johnathon and the alteration of the 'crowd" has changed the whole scene for me.  But man, I have missed it and I realized it then.  A lot of me has been involved with various aspects of PMB...from hitting the road to bars to the music.  it's defnitely been an influence on the past few years.  i can't even begin.....  So yeah we had to jet out of there and be in Baltimore by 9 pm because I was being merch bitch for Army of Me that night at Fletchers.  i can't even tell you how many times I have eaten a Wawa dinner while speeding down 95.  i swear, those two weeks, 95 was definitely my bitch.  Good times at Fletchers.  Army of Me and 33 West were really cool.  Head home because I think I worked the next day.  I can't remember.

      ::::::::::::Spring Break 2003::::::::::::::::::::: (end of March, beginning of April) was in Maine.  Wooooo.  So this is the first time in YEARS that I had a full week off from anything...riding competitions, work, etc.  So Aurora and I had decided that since everyone else was heading south, that we would head north.  I had wanted to go back and visit Boston and New Hampshire while she had family in Maine who she wanted to see.    OH WAIT, the night before Aurora, Fin, Dave, and I drove to DC to see Lloyd Dobler Effect and Jonsay headlineline at the 9:30 club.  Aurora and I had been looking forward to this date as well as avoiding it for a while, since the Millenium Music Conference probably.  haha nothing bad, but we thought it would be odd for both entities since so much was divulged at the MMC.  But a good time was had by all. We got to see a lot of the freinds we had made at the MMC and it was a mini reunion.  Ahhhh...the MMC...what a great weekend....(see blogs from mid february haha) ok, back :-)  sorry , mind wandered....  So yeah, Jen and Jess were there and it was great fun near the front.  Good shows all around.  Thank God Aurora was DD that evening.    OH WAIT!  Right before that show, LDE played at the Logan House.  Good old Logan House.   Logan Hosue is the second best place, right next to East End.  So again, it was a reunion at the Logan House.  A bunch of my friend who I haven't seen in a while came out to that show.  Plus we got Aurora in.  Damn, now that I look back at it, that was a crazy night.  I think I utterly embarrassed myself and Melissa and Rick were asked to never come to the Logan Hosue again.  Let's see, who was there....myself, Aurora, Nate, Michelle, Jason, Christina, Rick, Melissa, Ali, Gabe, Marty, Fin, Bob, Rob, Eric, Beth, Karen, and Christina (part 2).....damn, we packed the place.  We pregamed at the apartment then headed up.  Aurora got in, yay.  Nothing like back doors :-)   I had a drink that was more like a big shot and I think I should have been done there.  but noooo.....not when you're with the LDE boys.  Rusty bought me shots.  Shots with lots of stuff in it.  I think I remember dancing.  i remember creepy guys.  I remember having Fin and Rick and Eric save me.  Upstairs downstairs upstairs downstairs.  Sitting on the stage with Phil and not being able to get up.  More shots.  Gabe then got kicked out of Logan House for drunkeness but he escaped back upstairs for more shots, so Kamikazes all around.  Then he got hauled off and Melissa and Rick and Gabe were told to never come back.  (we're going back tonight! haha)  I think the music stopped around this time.  I dodn't remember anyone leaving.  I remember being "backstage" on the "balcony".  Then as we were leaving...................yeah.  Aurora told me days later what i said.... And I think Mark had gotten another drunk phone call...?  Oh no, Aurora had my phone and called him.  OH because it was right after on stage, Phil goes to begin another song, looks over to where I was and says "I'm Mark Williams from the band Jonasay" and I think he began Gone Away.  Only two of us there got it, but it was hilarious.  There's this thing where the two of them, when they call me, will sya that they are the other , and I swear if i didn't have caller id I wouldn't know the difference half the time.  haha.  Aurora and my mother have gotten into that as well.  But I can tell the female voices apart from the male voices ;-)  But phil is getting more multi faceted.  he has stepped into the shoes of Graham Colton while leaving me messages.    Oh yeah, so back to ...um...spring break.... So we decide to head north.  and at the 9:30 club show Michael said that they were playing up in orono, which is right near where we were staying.  Fancy that.  So Aurora and I left on Sunday, a mere 4 hours after we go to bed from the 9:30 show.  Hit a Wawa then the highway.  Good tunes in the player and good times in the car.  We hit up Vintage Vinyl, this really awesome record store in Jersey.  Finally found a Ryan Adams album I was looking for.  We almost got shot at a rest stop in Connecticut.  Aurora was at the ATM then we hear a Middle Eastern man fight with some NYC kids.  All you see are parent covering up their kids heads and running.   It was hilarious, in a way....  Hit rain and snow.  Stayed at Aurora's cousin's place at UNE.  We ordered Papa johns....we were STARVING.  So after waiting hours for this pizza that was way late and way expensive, we paid part in change.  he wasn't pleased.  The next day we hit up New Hampshire and I played photographer.  Before we had left, Aurora had seen a license plate that said "Oh Maine" so we felt it necessary to shout that out every so often.  OHHHH MAINEEEEE......that was Tuesdays fun.  There was an inch or two of snow on the ground.  And we saw steel dinisaurs in some guys yard.  Oh trust me, this is all on film.  Then we went to U of ME to see Jonasay play.  After the show I had wanted to head home, I figured we were already up and that the 10 hour drive woul dbe more doable at night with no one on the road.  Aurora had wanted to stay and wake up super duper early.  We talked and figured we would head back to DE then.  So we were all talking before we're leaving.  And Justin is staring off iinto space.  or we thought he was.  (sorry , have to do it)  Aurora has on this jacket.  With pockets.   And her hands are in the pockets.  Then after Justin is silent for minutes, we hear "it's likea puppet show" as he is staring at her hands in her pockets.  But it doesn't look innocent.  Then we all follow his eyes and realize where he is staring.  Nothing can be said.  The Aurora says "yeah, they sometimes do that".  Justin tries to save himself, but fails ;-) And all was saved.  I missed the context of this, but Mike and Aurora apparently will always have Maine. And something about doing it like lobsters.  Then we kidnap Mark and head home.  We go and get gasat this place that was pretty far away from anything.  Before we had left we got the lecture from Aurora's dad about losing keys and how I should have a spare set.  Has anyone clued this man into how often I lose keys!?!  Well, I jump out to get some coffee because its 1 am and we have 10 hours ahead of us.  Aurora jumps out to smoke.  Mark gets out to pump gas.  After a few minutes in the gas mart thingy we come back to find the car locked.  The keys are on the drivers seat.  The spare set is in my bag.  And Mark locked the doors to protect our stuff.  Fun in Maine.  So after fooling around in the mart thing, we have to call a locksmith.  He saved the day.  Who does that 600 miles from home??!??!?!?!?!?! So back on the road, time to head out.  We stop to see Megan again at UNE.  Driving driving driving.  Amazingly I made it from Maine to NJ.  Without getting a ticket from the hordes of cops we passed.  Listen to some good tunes, had good conversation.  pretty damn tired.  We all hadn't showered or changed in a lot longer than what we should have.  Got to DE around 11 am.  Damn, we drove all night.  Aurora leaves to go home, while Mark and I explored Newark.  Went to Rainbow then ate lunch at Homegrown.  Then we took the Cabrio out for a spin to Towson.  first time this year the top was off.  Word.  Got to Brooke's and plpayed with the horses.  then to the mall.  then ate Chinese.  then to a record store.  Shit, we haven't slept yet!?  Then off to DC then back.  I slept FOREVER. WHEW

      Well, I don't even know where to begin. Last night was a great night.   I can't even begin to write right now on how much PMB has been a part of my life the past few years.  If you know me, then you would know, but if you don't then you will read about that all later.  But yes, PMB played an outside show in Newark last night.  Lauren and her boyfriend came down for the show and Karen, Melissa, and I ran into everyone there.  It was just a good time.  It was also like an STN reunion which was freaky haha. I like how Public Safety was there to ensure there was no alcohol and nearly everyone there had sports bottles (see previous blog) or juice bottles in hand.  It was just great to be there with my closest freinds singing away to PMB at an outdoor night show.  It sounded great and the atmosphere was wonderful.  I don't know if my friends enjoyed me serenading them though.  ;-) Having PMB play in Newark in one of my last weekends here was a good sendoff.   Off to Logan House!  Karen, Melissa, Aurora and I trke up 95 to LH to see LDE play next.  In the 15 minute carride we decorates Karen's car with pornographic images and Aurora and I had a conversation with each other while both on Phil's voicemail.  We go in and and a good time was had by all :-)  They played a good set of mostly all originals so yay.  Michelle and Jason and Tim made it down so it was great hanging out with them as well.  And LDE Jenn was there so we made her dance with us :-)  But all in all a great night at the LH once again.  And damn those boys.  I swear every time I see them I end up not feeling so well............. I love LH's backstage, its more like the balcony.  At least no one fell down the stairs this time.  I met Phil's family and think I confused them all.  Stole Phil's visor and someones sunglasses.  Ended up with black stuff all over me.  Gave Phil back his hat, but came home with another hat somehow.  A huge conversation was had about the 9:30 club.....see now there is a debate on who didn't talk to who at the 9:30 club gig they did a ways back.  Dammit for being 5 against 2.    Damn time for work, I will finish this blog when I get back FROM PETE YORN TONIGHT!!

      I have decided to begin a new topic on this online journal...."Lessons I Have Learned Today" I will begin this thread with today's story and follow that up with a story from yesterday that I apparently did NOT learn my lesson and repeated again today....  Story from today: To avoid a mess in the kitchen, do not mix soda and alcohol in a water bottle then put your finger over the spout and proceed to roll the bottle to mix the two ingredients.  Because when you remove your finger from the spout, it will be like volcano eruption.  Tonight is yet another Logan House night if you have not guessed already.  And there are two reasons for drinking prior to going.  One, thats a few less drinks to actually purchase, therefore saving money.  And two, by pre-gaming, you do not lose valuable gaming time at the venue.  So yes, that is why I was mixing soda and alcohol in my Nike water bottle and thought it would be a good idea to roll it.  Not a good idea.  Story from yesterday that was repeated today:  When you pour pasta from a bag into a pot on the stove, do not spill any noodles on the red hot burner.  They will catch on fire.  Yesterday I dropped a noodle on the burner and did not know it until the smoke detector went off and I found a little flame coming from the noodle on the burner.   Now today, I made pasta again, and again, I spilled a noddle onto the burner.  the smoke detector did not go off, but again, there was flammage in the kitchen.  So yes, do not spill noodles on the burner.  You will cause a fire.

      I think Mr. Fish has a fungus.  Mr. Fish has a white spot on his back and is swimming a bit off kilter.  He has also been chilling in the plant.  Usually he doesn't chill in the plant, he prefers the back corner, but no, he was all up in the plant's business today.  This is my interpretation of Mr. Fish:  })<>  I will keep you updated on Mr. Fish's condition.

      I think I am a vampire.   I was up till 4 am editing the Green to Think video.  I think Jen, who was editing a package as well, and I knew we lost it when we struggled to open a box around 2:30am.  We couldn't get the box open, and only after did we mangle it did we see the "open here" on the box.  You often wonder why such obvious things have labels, such as "open here".  Yeah, it's for epople like us in the wee hours of the morning when we have lost all common sense.  Jen equated it with labels on irons.  Unfortunately I must have missed that label since I still have a triangular mark from three years ago on my arm from when I thought it was a good idea to iron my shirt while still on me. And speaking of good ideas, I forgot to mention this in my previous blog but was just reminded....Playing Grottos Pizza toss is always a good idea.  At the GTT after party Dave wanted me to toss him a piece of pizza, so I asked if I could really toss it.  Apparently a vote was taken and nearly all in the room thought this was a bad idea and that Dave and I were too hammered to make decision.  Dave reminds everyone that this is really a good idea and to back off.  Oh we were successful at the pizza toss.. So there! And back to GTT.  The music video fro Sunday's Were Made For This is going well.  If nothing else, I have learned in the television industry that when you expect something to take a certain amount of time, multiply that by four.  Again, I go to edit around 10 pm, the mandatory Wawa stop with the girls is crucial before editing--coffee and subs are key to a good work ethic, and didn't leave until 6 hours later.  At least I got some things accomplished, Jen worked for about 10 hours for a 30 minute piece all because the Cube decided to die.  And I thought I was the only one that broke equipment. But back to the video again....it's going pretty well and it should be done *soon* so look for it shortly....  Working with 8 video tracks and 6 audio tracks to match up.  The final cut will only have two audio tracks, but the other four are need to match the video up.  And actually one track is a culmination of 4 other video tracks, so I guess technically I am working with 11 video tracks.  Dizzamn.  Don't get me wrong, I love doing this, but when I open my tracksheet I feel like a kid running into Toys R Us.  You see so much stuff you want to play with and you dart back and forth from aisle to aisle because you want t play with everything and anything at once.  At least the song is only 5 minutes long so I am a bit limited ;-)  And maybe if the boys sang on time with their studio version then it wouldn't be such a daunting task ;-)  So far the rough cut is remincent of a Japanimation film.  Maybe I will have reason to use the Karate Kid cuts now....

      In 28 hours I went to North Carolina and back.   I had to.  There was no other option but to put on another thousand miles on my odometer.  Jonasay opened up for Vertical Horizon.  At ZIGGY's.  VH is one of my favorite bands and I don't think I moved from the side of the stage from Send it Up until You're A God.  It's a good thing security didn't try to move me from in front of the barricade because I was going nowhere.  Enough said.   IHOP is always great, even better in the rain.    This week should be interesting....mucho hours at the record store...Ike on Thursday, Pat McGee Band and Lloyd Dobbler Effect on Friday, Pete Yorn on Saturday.  Pat's favorite record store in DE is Rainbow, perhaps he'll pay a visit while I'm working before playing Newark. :-) Last time he bought some Brittany Spears because him and Chardy were going to see a Brittany show (or when you talk of homogenized bubble gum pop, is it called "show" or is it a  "concert" or "performance") and he wanted to be prepared.......  I'm going to update my webapge now, check back in a few hours....

      Saturday was the Mardi Gras bar loop in Wilmington.  Karen, Melissa, and Rick and I went to four bars and ended up at Logan House.  Though I was the DD, Melissa said that I looked the most trashed in the pictures that were taken.  The pictures will be up on my site when I get back from work.  We played a game called "lets see how many creepy old guys stare at miranda".  we lost count after the third bar.  Ok, just a word of advice to guys...don't be creepy.  don't be obvious and don't say creepy things.  that is not a turn on and we will just stand that much farther away from you. ended the night with some Ike at the Logan House.  talked to the guys after and hung out till way after close.  John Faye initiated me "into the family".  haha.  Good times :-) And none of us got kicked out.  yay.

      Friday was Rob's last day at work.  So he wore a suit and cumberband (he couldn't find a bowtie)  and Jen and I wore formal dresses.  Seeing how I must have grown taller since the last time I wore my dress, my evening was dedicated to not violating the twon of Newark in our front side window.  Hopefully I managed.  We did all of our traditions...listened to Magnetic Fields, Death by Chocolate, and ended the evening with OUR song.  "Birthday Bitches" by Insane Clown Posse.  It's just a hilarious song.  Rob didn;t know how IC P sounded, so we put in their newest cd and I thought the song title sounded funny, so we played that.  And geez, its hilarious.......WHO SAYS THAT!?!?  I'll find the lyrics and post them later.  We had streamers, bubbles, and glow sticks.  It was an all out rave in Rainbow on a happening Friday night.

      Ok, what happened after that weekend...oh yeah Dewey GTT style.  you should check out Green to Think at www.greentothink.com and check out Steve's road journal.  Mine will pretty much mirror his haha. On Friday, Steve, Ken, and Gilligan stopped by WVUD to do some acoustic songs in the studio and play around on air.  The songs came out really well, I think we recorded seven....  The we picked out some music and went on air.  everyone agrees that the Rhett Miller album is incredible.  But have you ever heard GTT back it up? I brought up Steve and Ken up on air during the chorus and I swear I think I nearly fell off my chair from laughter.  gilligan walked out and said he wanted nothing to do with this atrocity.  It was definitely great.  We had a lot of callersand had some fun on air.  Good times, check back to GTT's site in the near future to see pictures from the studio. Then we trekked down Main Street for dinner at the East End.  And we looked for houses in PA.  Trailers are pretty cheap.  Then again, you can move to another zip code in a day if you need to  by just putting wheels on the house.  Steve reminded us that it was cheap for a reason.  And the faucet was fun for all.  No wonder all of us were in the bathroom for eternity.  The faucet was very sensitive in that if you turned it slightly to the right or left it was comparable to Niagra Falls.  Turning the water off became a well honed art. Then off to Rainbow.  We stopped so I could write them directions on how to get out of there, but of course no one can come to rainbow without buying music.  lots of music.  Lots of good music.  Juliana Hatfield and TtWS were a few things that were bought.  Gilligan bought a Muffs cd.  Again, if you check out GTT's board, you will see how Gilligan got his Muff busted.   (and it is confirmed that Delaware rocks because of no tax and you can leave a camera on a bumper for 5 miles/2 hours and it will still be there when you return) On Saturday Aurora and I head down to the beach.  We went down to see the Dewey Beach Pop Festivaland so i could film GTT for their music video for Sundays Were Made For This (again, check out there site shortly to see it...).  The show went all.  Full attendence :-) I am gonna butcher everyones names, but hopefully I spell them right.  How is it that the guys have the simple names and us girls are the ones with the interesting spellings?!?!  Maryellen, Dareen, and Meggan were there and we all got to hang out during the show and after......but more to after later...  Also saw Ike play and hung out with them a little but after.  Definitely a solid performance.  Who else did we see...Pilot radio...Wayne Supergenius....peppers ghost.....hmmmmm can't remember who else... So since everyone caused a ruckus Friday night, we didn;t want to party at the Southwinds.  So i go and get a hotel since we were filming the music video on Sunday.  Aurora said that the Marina Sands was totally booked, but I figured we'd try anyway.  Aurora, Dave, Dareen, and I went there and the woman gave us a $400 suite for $60.  SCORE.  So the crew was called and a good time was had in room 410.  The room without the number on the front.  Had some drinks...had some food...had the camera........ I don't even know where to bign...the superstrong drinks, Ken telling me to "lay off the raspberry shit"  Steve's nack and Ken's teeth....Dave and I playing pizza toss.  general chaos.....then the napkins emerged.....Chris didn't come over to hang out, so we took his face button and i drew a body and a bass on a napkin.  So we pretended Chris was there.  That was fun, but not as fun as having GTT as a napkin band.  So I made bodies to match all of the GTT pins.  That with an immense amount of plastic bottle vodka and captain calls for good times.  I think I was seriously crying from laughter most of the time.  I can't even explain.  If I am crafty enough, I will post it on my site.   And the captain himself came out to close out the party....support original spiced rum, not cover spiced rum DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT A SPLIT DICK IS?!??!? Then the filming of the music video on the beach.   But before that, we ate at Sharkey's.  the coolest eatery at the beach :-) Sharkey works 14 hours a day at his restaraunt.  And his food is mighty fine. I think the footage came out great, so lets see what can happen with it now.  Between the chorus and the bridge, there was a little Karate Kid action.  What is it about poles that makes guys think that they can actually be stuntmen like in the movies ;-)  Again, check out the GTT message board for info all about Dave and his masterful pole work..... ;-) and I think I filmed too much on the beach since at the end, Ken yells out "CAN WE GO HOME YET!!! let's get the hell out of Dodge" so we did.

      This is in Whitney's profile and oh how sadly its ture...  As I prepare to graduate from UD, I was thinking back on what I thought college would teach me, and how that compared to what I actually learned.  What I thought I UD would teach me:   1. The world is a very diverse place, filled with different kinds of people.   2. There's a lot of smart people out there, and you have to work hard to compete with them. 3. Vital skills that would help me get a job.  What UD actually taught me: 1. Everyone is white, upper middle class, and either Jewish or Methodist.  2. 98% of the people in the world are dumbasses. When talking to someone in class or at a party, speak slowly and use simple words or you'll confuse them.   3. Communication is a bullshit major. I will now proceed to find a wealthy 95 year old man and marry him.

      Just got back from seeing saucy Pete Yorn at the E-Factory this evening.    "No Nate, this is FUN! You're having a GOOD time!!" --me to Nate after I miss my exit for the show for the fourth time as we head into to Jersey... "You know, it wouldn't be a trip with you if you didn't get lost or hit a creature" --Nate  Yup, that pretty much sums it up.  I had to close the store tonight then we left for Philly after.  Nate won free tickets, and he knows how much I enjoy Petey, so he didn;t mind missing the frist two bands since I worked.  Yay.  But see, we would have gotten there sooner if I didn't get lost.  Missed the street several times, went down some wrong ways I think....ended up in Jersey.  The ghetto of Jersey.  I don't think me cutting people off, stopping on the Interstate, or weaving helped matters much.  But I think Nate yelling out "HEY!!!  Rich White People LOOOOOSTTTT!!!!" through the ghetto was a death wish.   We ended up at the Electric Factory and only missed the first song.  We had some very interesting dancers next to us.  One reminded me of an octopus with her arms flailing about everywhere.  The other liked to bob off beat and when there wasn't any music playing.  Great setlist with old and new stuff, but mostly songs from the new album.  His encore was great, 4 songs, 3 including covers from Jeff Buckley, the Stone Roses, and Bruce Springsteen.  Niiiiiiiiiice. On the drive home, without getting lost, we busted up some smooth jazz , rolled down the windows, put the seats back, and rolled through the east side blaring some sax.  We got some very interesting looks.  Nate gave the thumbs up to a cute girl and the look on her face was priceless.  Nate says he likes to see girls expressions when he calls out to them or waves at them or whatnot and they look over and see me driving.  Hahahahaha speaking of which, I can control al of the windows on my dirver side panel and a fun game is to roll down the passengers' window and shout somehting out to someone because the passenger looks out to see whats going on, but then the person that is being yelled at looks at the car and yeah...... so again, we play this game, or more likely, I play this game while driving around Philly.  Nate then reaches over to cover my controllers as well as his controllers which causes us to nearly die.  Oh wait, that was me. We are a few blocks away from the venue and then is when i figured it would be a good idea to put on my glasses.  "You've had your glasses here the whole time?!?!??" Came back to Newark and went to DP Dough and it was like a freakshow here in town.  I think Cinderella missed the stroke of midnight because Newark was afoot with youngin's.  It was scary.

      So I finally finished the Green to Think music video, "Sundays Were Meant For This".  It kicks major ass.  I can't even count how long it took to complete the project...and this is just the music video, the "rockumentary" has been finished.  Brace yourself for boring tv speak.  I had nine video tracks to work with and four audio tracks to use for sync-ing.  All for five minutes and ten seconds.  To me, it is comparable to handing me a palette of paints.  You have so many choices and so much that you can create with what you have. That was the only obstacle, just having so many visuals and not knowing which was the strongest to use since all of my choices had strong and weak points.  The only stifliing factor was that if one clip was off, they were all off at that one part.  Well see if anyone can catch my "coorections".  And of course, out of all nine video clips, none were at the same tempo as the recorded track that I used for the video.  The fun of NOT creating a japanamation music video.  Reading lips has become a fine art that I have mastered.  And speaking of which, a few thinsg I have noticed while watching the video four hundred times: Steve's lips don't match the word he is saying.  Hours later I still don't think he says "side".  He says "by his...'something other than side'".  And you know how when you concentrate on doing something, it becomes more difficult?  Such as breathing, when you think about it, it seems like such a more daunting task than it actually is. take Ken and walking in the video.  Again, watching the video nonstop, I noticed how Ken walks a bit stilted as if he is trying too hard to walk.  Or then again it could be just the stunt cock that is hindering the graceful walking through the sand.   But the video is complete and though I had bouts of insanity from caffeine and sleep deprivation , I think it came out pretty damn good and I didn't damage anything this time.  Nothing exploded and all of the technology in the editing rooms are still intact (see previous blog on how I made the editing cube explode and now deemed inoperable).  Yay for survival.

      Just because it is free does not mean you should eat it.  That is today's lesson.  Or Sunday's lesson. So we have had "Peace A Pizza Day" on the calendar at work for about a week.  Whatever you get in, is buy one get one free.  Peace A Pizza is the best pizza ever....well, Margherita's is the best pizza ever, but Peace A Pizza is a different breed.  So Charise, Max, and I thought it wouldbe a good idea to get 2 pizzas for the three of us.  Baaaaaaad idea.  Seeing how this pizza is filling after one slive, getting 16 slices really doesn't make sense looking back on it.  So we get baked potato pizza and the basil mozzerella pizza with extra tomatoes.   I worked at the record store from open to close and pizza was my breakfast lunch and dinner. I was in the fetal positon for most of the day when I got home. Lesson: do not eat more pizza than you can chew. :-X

      The whole awkwardness that I mentioned in the previous blog about wanting to fulfill every waking second with something to be remembered was definitely met the days after.   The Tuesday of that week was spent cramming for CHEM.  Which was, the worst thing ever.  Nothing like taking my last test ever and going out with a bang.  the damn thing was 61 pages long.  61 pages LONG!!!!!  It was horrendous.  Not that I should be complaining though, instead of studying, we decided to bowl in the apartment.  Anything that was long, cylander, and plastic was victim to the 12 pound bowling ball that I found in the closet.  I think the neighbors downstairs were about to murder us.  The best was the filled ketchup bottles we used, those things just wanted to fly.   The day after goes down in history as the best indoor water fight ever.  So we get home from East End and Natalie and I were playing jokes on Karen, but payback is a bitch.  She used my cellphone and AIM to talk....and yeah, I freaked and water balloons went flying.  For about an hour there was water balloons, the kitchen spray nozzle thingy, and even water filled trash cans which soaked the entire apartment and ourselves.   It was definitely great :-)

      Melissa keeps getting on my case to update the Blog ;-).  Wow, it's been over a month...time to recap.  I'll go in chronological order... May 25- The Big STN Shebang... Yeah, a lot went down that day, but we'll begin with the night before. I think all of us were going crazy towards the end of May, mostly trying to get all that we could out of these last moments together.  A lot was left unsaid, due to the fact that none of us wanted to admit that things were ending.  But again, like I said before, to quote the band Semisonic, "every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end"... The 24th was our final TV crew pizza night.  This is where all the TV girls get together at my place, pick up Margherita's pizza, and talk about...um...mostly TV productions.  So sad so sad...  So inaddition to pizza night, we had to get the goods ready for the party the next night.  Karen and I make the best jello shots in the world.  Yes, we actually are world champs at it.  So we get in the Cabrio and pick up the crew.  We stop by Warner to pick up Brittany, but Brittany isn't alone....who is this strange man...?  It's candyland man!  So he gets in too and we kidnap him to the pizza place then 5208.  I really think I scared him.  The frightening started with my driving.  Apparently they, yes, a collective they, feel that I have too much energy when I am excited be contained in such a bitty vehicle.  Yeah.  So we go back to the apartment, where we make small talk with candyland man.  See, we have all heard of this guy, but apparently all of the info I had garnered should not have been revealed.  Such as where he lives, or what high school he went to, or the movie he made.  The look on his face when I said "oh, so you live in Claymont" was priceless.  that was just part two of the frightening.  Then we started making jello shots.  Then Aurora came in plastered.  Brittany and Candyland Man do not drink, well, he didn't before the next day.  I think he thought that being wasted and making shots were an everyday occurence for all of us.  So after we had about 100 shots, we have to transport them to Epler's.  All five of us pile in Karen's car to drop off trays of jello shots a few blocks away.  As I ask the crew if this is driving with an open container and as they count actually how many open containers it would be, we pass a cop.  There was so much illegality going on in the car then.  We drop of the stuff then figured that since Jen missed the evenings events since she was editing her program, we should go to the White House and scare her (WHICH WHEN IT HAPPENS TO YOU IS NOT A GOOD IDEA!).  So Aurora, Karen, and I go to the WH after we drop the kids off at Warner.  We had an eloborate plan of throwing things and breaking in.  So I find a Snapple bottle and think that that's a good thing to throw up to the second story window.  So I toss it up and the girls run inside.  We were using our cells phones like walkie-talkies and I couldn't hear a damn thing.  jen said soemthing, we started laughing and ran out and hid in the trees.  Then she saw us from behind and we were caught :-(.  So we go inside and then devise a plan to steal the coke machine that's downstairs.  It hasn't been used in years and was last inspected in 1994.  We deserve it. Onto the party.   I had to work for a few hours beforehand, then pick up Jay and Aurora to pregame the party at the apartment.  Pretty much EVERYONE from the TV station was at our apartment midafternoon pregaming the actual party.  We were about to leave when Andy calls my apartment saying he is the only one at Eplers and where the hell are we.  So then he comes over and partakes in the action, then we head over.   Too much to even write...or remember.... Since I am not allowed to mix drinks anymore because I make them lethally strong, I thought I would try my hand at making Jungle Juice.  They yelled at me for wanting to use Brita water, seeing how the grain alcohol would kill ANY bacteria in the water.  We played the longest beer pong game ever.  Did shots with Carlos.  Convened in the bathroom....many times.  It was a crazy good time.   Then we ended the night at Kates for 80's night with Fin and Marty. Work the next day absolutely SUCKED.

      I'm going to Vegas until the end of the week.  Then I promise I will write.  i will write fully about Baltimore, New York City, DC, and Philly.  I have been up and down the east coast in the past month, at least I stayed coast side pretty much.   I absolutely utterly despise flying.  And I will be flying tomorrow...technically today.  I pretty much have a panic attack then delerium carries me to the landing.   Keep your fingers crossed that I will rule the poker and blackjack tables...as I normally do...and win enough money to open my own venue here ;-) Yeah right.

      Washington DC - June 20th Yesterday was 95 North, today is 95 South... This day was bittersweet for me, it was pretty much the final time I was able to hang out with the tv crew and film a concert.  We filmed Jonasay headline at one of my favorite venues, the 9:30 club. So hello again monsoon!!  Aurora came over early and we waited for everyone else.  When we realized that the clouds could not drop any MORE rain, we left early to go get the vehicles since we figured that we'll probably be behind schedule because of the rain. Yay for the go-go Durango and the van...off to the studio!!  Go to the studio, then I get three phone calls all at the same time...Marissa, Jay, and Jen saying they were stuck in traffic and will be a little late.  I wanted to be on 95 by 3 and we were, and all is good.  I was banished from driving in the monsoon since I didn't have my glasses on me.  There was also blood shed.  Aurora was driving-her and I battle for the most interesting driver award, this is why our road trips up and down the coast are always so fun- and we all decided it was not a good idea to look out the window while she was driving.  So I look up and death was almost near so I did the imaginary brake thing and my foot got caught under the glove compartment and I cut it.  Going about 90 mph in torrential rains was exhilerating.  And exhilerating means going to DC was spent trying to beat the other van.   So we arrive in DC.  The 9:30 club is not in the best of neighborhoods, our lives were threatened.  So we get there, unload, set up, the usual.  And like at every venue, I get yelled at.      Aurora caused sparks from her comm box.  And the production went wonderfully.  We definitely are a fabulous crew.    We stopped at a rest stop on the way home, where Aurora gave me a card signed by everyone and she had a goodbye memory box of all of our musical endeavors together.  It was purple and silver and had music memorabilia in it as well as fun little quotes written on purple and silver stars....if I wasn't so exhausted, I would have definitely cried from an overwhelming sense of joy and sorrow.  It was one of the best gifts I have ever received all because it reminded me of what an incredibly amazing year it has been and the time spent with such wonderful people.  I will share...  First and foremost...a Wawa cup, pretty much my fuel for any roadtrip or marathon editing session Aurora and my business card, yes, we have business cards haha Matches...because at the Millenium Music Conference (again, one of the best weekends, revert to mid February blog) at 7:30 when everyone finally leaves your room and you're tucked in by the GTT guys, you just need something to make fire... Plastic boots...because these boots were made for walking......you never know what you see fans wearing... Batteries..because who randomly has two batteries in their pockets when Justin asks for them, oh yeah, Aurora haha A plastic dinosaur.  No, not for the obvious, but for the dinosaurs we saw in the snow in Maine during Spring break A horse, because sometimes you just can't find your horse at 3 am in the rain... A LAMINATE The words to Eminem's "Lose Yourself" because I don't know the words And lastly, a purple loofah.  Again, we will go back to the MMC, where we remembered everything but loofahs.  Nothing like going for a beer and loofah run with LDE  And the purple star quotes... -"The Captain gave us mono" again, refer to the music conference where the whole dman Hilton shared our bottle of Captain and Aurora and I got so sick the week after..and hell, we still went to NC anyways... -"Can I say shit? Shit! Shit! Shit!" interview quote -"Why we love SWIFT... 1) Swift Holly 2) Seany's nickname 3) Our favorite truck drivers" -"The Boys of LDE next door -- 'Yo, Phil, we're in room 521, what room are you guys in? 520!?!??! NO WAY!'" -"Zombies!!" Don't drink and do drugs and dance. -"Aurora: 'You locked the keys in the car didn't you?' Mark: Yeah...'" At a gas station in Maine... -"It looks like a puppet show!" Again, scandelous behavior in Maine... -"If I stay with you, will you stay with me through the nighttime" - So Aurora and I have this thing that we have to play the same songs throughout our car rides together, whether we go to Towson or Maine, we have to hear the same songs.  And of course this line was fitting while Ken and Steve kept us up all hours of the night at the MMC haha -CENSORED, but it has to do with NOASIS and NORTH KACKALACKI! -"I eat my words well" Aurora, on the fact that no matter what she says, she gets disproven ;-) -"Yeah, we don't clap" -"Are you done? It's always about you....I'm the lead singer and I masturbate!  Can we talk about my masturbation now?" Mike to Justin in the CS interview -"What a coinkidink" maybe we shouldn't talk about what we do in front of other people.... -"I could marry Bono..he's not too old for me" Aurora, saying this I think in Connecticut.  One of the many reasons we're friends haha. -"We'll always have Maine" Mike to Aurora...in Maine "He's the quy and shiet type" Amazing Aurora said this as we left the Seeking Homer show at Fletchers and neither of us had been drinking haha -"You don't fucking know what I do"  -"This is Justin Sheehy from the rock band Jonasay" voicemail left on Aurora's phone -"This is Mark Williams from the rock band Jonasay...left by Phil (of LDE)" repeated v-mail on my phone -"This is Phil Kominski from the Lloyd Dobler Effect....left by Mark" repeated v-mail on my phone -"Top 5 car trip albums: 1) SDFD, Jonasay   2) Portrait, Jonasay   3) Waiting for my Rocket to Come, Jason Mraz   4) Joshua Tree, U2   5) Forty Licks, Rolling Stones"  Aurora and I spend thousands of miles in the car together and no matter what, these albums get mega spins.  Green To Think's EP comes in close on that list as well.  Nothing beats trying to sing "Better" nonstop to Towson from Harrisburg with an already raw throat...  So yay for an awesome excursion to DC with the posse.

      New York City - June 19th So you know when you see someone from the car and you kinda play car tag, dodging in and out of traffic and making a point to adjust the mirror at the light just for kicks?  Driving back to the apartment before heading out to the big apple, Karen and I decided to mess with this guy in a Camero after he kept staring over at us.  She got his number.  It was smooooooth.   We stopped home, then hit 95 N to the city.  We met up with our friend Mike Clarke and Ryan, a coworker of his to see the sights, hit the bars, and experience some music.  It was when we actually parked the car when we realized that we had no idea what we were doing or where we even were.  The day was brought to us by the colors red and black which all of the city decided to join us in wearing.  Through a marathon phone tag session with Mike, we met up with the guys and hit an original pizza place then off to a bar.  Yay for beer.  Then another bar.  Then another bar. Subway to Tribeca.  It's pretty bad when you have four drunk people not knowing where they really are in the city and its still daylight out.  Saw the band outside and found another bar.  This time it was Cuban.  We hit up Tribeca shortly before Jonasay went on.  What an awesome little club.  Again, it reestablished my desires to run my own venue.  Yeah, it might happen.  Good drinks, good people, good music.  After Tribeca we hit another bar with world jazz music.  I think I stopped drinking at this point, but Mike definitely did not, whicle his antics on stage evidenced how much he drank.  It was great.  Then more pizza.  We went to go grab my car in the lot when I suddenly remembered that I had no idea where I had parked.  Not a good thing to do in NYC!  Despite my absentmidedness, I have a stellar photographic memory and was able to orient myself after seeing a gas station sign.  My mind works in odd ways.  The trek home was extremely slow due to the monsoon that met up with us as soon as the tires met up with 95.  I went about 40 miles an hour half way there just because I couldn't keep in control of my car, nor see.  The highlight of the highway span was when Karen had to have me pull over on the interstate in the hurrican so she could throw up.  Now she is initiated in the "puking on national highways" club.

      The new New Pornographers cd makes me extremely happy.  Again, like the Tim Easton album from last night, I feel that this CD is nearly flawless.  I think I have listened to the recording at least seven times in the past four days.  I really enjoy the Stratford 4 album that I listened to as well today.  The newlyweds came over tonight and we all ate chinese food.  It was crazy good times.    And speaking of crazy, I am off to bed because I have this insane notion that I will actually wake up early and go running before work.  Ok, and so yeah, the new Turin Brakes video just came on Subterranean.  I like Ethersong a lot better than the Optimist LP.  Subterranean is one of my favorite things.  Other entities that I have exclaimed were my favorite things in the past twelve hours: the new Fruit Juicy Grapermelon gum, internet at work, my black ballet slippers that I wore today, and vegetable spring rolls.  Those are the best things ever.

      I'm listening to Tim Easton, and you're not. I think his latest album, Break Your Mother's Heart, is nearly perfect.  So *they* say that kids don't buy music anymore.  In the past two days I have had three people buy CDs in change.  Sucks for me to count it, but a little heartwarming as well to realize that these kids are scraping up loose change to purchase art.  There is faith.

      I'm at work.  I rock. The storefront of the record store is a giant window that looks onto Main Street.  When we moved locations, we felt as though this window would welcome more stalkers into the store since its like a micro version of live reality show.  This time, the TVs are off and its the Rainbow life that the passerby find them selves admiring, seperated by a smudged pane of glass.  So in my journeys from cd racks to cash register to vinyl bins to internet, I almost always find myself on the other side.  Constantly staring out the window at life passing by.  We find ourselves staring out, more so then people staring in.  That we are the actual voyeurs. Nothing really exciting happens outside of the window.  For pete's sake the Gap is across the street.  Thrillesville in homogenizationland.  A Dunkin Donuts is being built across the street as well.  Welcome, Commercialization.  Though I do have to admit I am a bit excited for the instant accessibilty of cheap coffee minutes away.  But isn't three DDs' in Newark a tad extreme?   We also overlook the crosswalk, which always provides entertainment: does or does not the vehicle stop for the pedestrians?  It's the main crosswalk in Newark, and though pedestrians do have the right of way, I think it is reinforced by a neon yellow sign.  More often then not, the cars don't stop.  Which all in all is ok because Main Street doesn't get that busy that one has to wait for longer than a minute to dart across the street.  Reminds me of the game Frogger.

      Greetings from the editing room.   Waiting for footage to load and thought I would stop in.  My current project is the Jonasay concert DVD from their headlining show at the 9:30 Club.  Coming out very very nicely.  Still syncing all of the video and audio together and working on graphics.  Currently loading all the fan footage then tackle that tonight.  Since we bring the portable studio to the venue and I switch the shots there, there isn't too much editing to do shot wise, just mostly matching all of the B-roll up.  The next few days will be going through the film frame by frame to work on lighting and stabilization and whatnot.  Let's do some math.  90 minute concert.  60 seconds in a minute.  3600 seconds in the show.  30 frames per second.  108,000 frames I will be watching.  We're calling this "The Masterpiece".

      Baltimore, MD - July 11 We packed the car and headed for Baltimore to see Jonasay play at Flecthers.  What a very random day... Aurora came over early so we could catch up on the past few weeks where we haven't talked as much.  We're partners in crime, which unfortunately has been quieted down a bit since she has been down south more.  It's a tradition that we hit up the Wawa right before 95 to fill up on cash and coffee, and of course, this day was full of traditions...a shortened roadtrip in a sense.  Most would call Baltimore a destination, but since we have travelled from Maine to North Carolina together, Baltimore is more like a skip.  So we're getting our coffee and we inadvertantly started singing to the Backstreet Boys song that was playing in the store.  We started laughing and the guy putting in his sugar next to me told us he was releived that we were singing and he wasn't embarrassed anymore.  He turns to this girl we can't see and says "who covers this, Matt or Howie".  And of course, because I am me, I look at him and say, "are you talking about Nathanson and Day?" and he responds with the same shocked lok that I must have given him, being oh so familiar with what he was saying.  The girl emerges wearing a Matt Nathanson shirt.  These are the moments that I truly enjoy what I do.  Matt Nathanson is currently on tour in the area and we talked about that and Howie's album that he is currently recording.  They ask where we're going, and we say a concert.  We ask the same question to them, and they reply..."going to a concert".  Ari Hest was playing at NXNW outside of Philly and asked us if we wanted to go.  Actually, Aurora and I probably would have if we weren't going to Fletcher's (OUR VENUE, well besides Recher...Fletcher's doesn't hate us yet).  The girl actually came up from Florida to see a bunch of music this week.  Wow, just like us.  They ended up being involved with the Nathanson camp.  So it was very odd and random that two people exactly like Aurora and I all met by singing a Backstreet Boy song while fixing our coffee at Wawa.....  What a wonderful world. On the trek to Fletcher's we pass a SWIFT Truck (where Aurora and I shout - "SWIFT!!!" Again, read previous blogs, especially the one after the 9:30 club).  Get to Fletcher's, take some shots outside the venue, then go upstairs.  We scope out who is there then head to get some Jager and beer.  We watched the opening band, The Brilliant Mistakes, who I thought were decent, indie raw rock kinda like Ben Folds meeting The Natural History.  We stroll around the venue some more and end up at the Jonasay email list book thingy where I think the girls wrote somehting, but I'm not sure....we were tlaking about band email lists and I said I don't get the Jonasay email, and then I think they wrote something.....I hope it wasn't embarrassing...hahaha.  Run into Mark and Justin and catch up.  Aurora spots a certain sticker on the merch table, where we both exclaim "SWIFT HOLLY!!" - yeah, we're weird.  Then off upstairs to the green room, which was actually silver.  Have fun up there, why does no one have a camera?!  Downstairs, see the show.  Played a good solid, energetic set to not that many people in the room.  What gives.  So we sang and dance and had an all around good time.   Food after at the Blue Moon where Michael and Aurora serenaded us with parts of Lady Madonna.  Random.  We all share secrets at the table and call it a night around 4 am.  But not before Aurora and I pull up to the Jonaven blasting "Wish" out the windows to make Karen get back in the car.  Justin just yells at us, "Hey!! I WROTE that song".  Ah. Get to bed around 5 and wake up 3 hours later to go to work.  And work for 11 hours.  Pass out, then work open to close on Sunday as well.  And I wonder why I don't feel well.  I will leave you with Nate's words of wisdom: "You know, you probably wouldn't be sick all the time if you maintained some semblance of a normal schedule"

      There are a few things that I would like to have for my new apartment that I am moving into in less than a month.  One is a silver mirror disco ball for my living room.  The other is a toaster.  New speakers would be great too.  So I can eat toast while grooving out.

      Las Vegas - June 30 - July 5 Wow, that was surreal.  Karen and I flew out to Nevada for a week because our roomate, Natalie, had her wedding in Vegas.  There are so many complications and stories intertwined in this trip.... The fun stuff first. :-)  I absolutely loathe flying, nothing that heavy should be soaring through the air.  Oh, I understand the physics, it's the logistics that just don't make it for me.  But the flight was fine and we arrived in sunny, warm, Nevada safely.  We decided to stay at the Boardwalk Casino because it is the home of the $3 tables, has a pool, in the middle of the strip, and um, yeah...was teh cheapest place to stay on the strip.  We do have priorities.  Less money spent on the hotel meant more money to gamble and spend going out.  Yes, the Boardwalk was definitely the cheapest place on the strip.  No fancy decor are flashing lights here.  We did have two clean beds and an immaculate bathroom though, all we needed.  We only had time to do one thing the night we arrived, so we decided to visit The Stratosphere, which is a 100+ story building with an exposed roller coaster on the top.  Woohoo!  There are a few things to know about Vegas: people are super friendly, the streets and sidewalks are amazingly clean, porn is everywhere, and everything LOOKS like walking distance.  The kay word is "looks".  With every building so flashy and tall, everything LOOKS close.  We were sadly and sorely mistaken.  On our trek there the two of us have never been cat called as many times as we had been.  Do you really think that since you're calling us from your ride as you cruise slowly down the street we're going to talk to you? No.  We spent our days by the pool, our afternoons gambling, and our nights at bars and clubs.  The next night we went to Coyote Ugly.  Didn't take much and shortly after we arrived Karen and I were up on the bars dancing and singing.   Is it good to go to a wedding hungover?  The wedding was the next day.  Yeah....another paragraph is needed for that, and I will get to that after the fun stuff.  The night of the wedding, Karen and I went to the Ghostbar, which is at the Palms, which LOOKED like walking distance.  So here Karen and I are in the streets of Vegas, dressed up, trying to walk across highways to the Palms.  We wouldn't have had to walk and risk our lives if Natalie didn't forget about us :-/.  But we got in, for free no less because we are so smooth and had a great time with the outstanding view.  the Ghostbar is on top of the casino on the 55th floor.  Its decorated in all black and purple and blue and green neon lights.  For more, see here: http://www.vegas.com/nightclubs/ghostbar/  Amazing.  And great drinks. :-)  The next night we went to see the Blue Man Group and eat and hang out at the Hard Rock.  BMG was an incredible show infusing world jazzy rock music with theatrical comedic performances.  Plus we got to meet them after, so that was cool.  Karen and I finally got to hang out with the newlyweds so we went to Hard Rock to eat, drink, and be merry.  I literally ran into Pat from Train and was too dumbfounded to say how amazing I think they are.  Fourth of July was our last night there and decided we just needed to be out all day and take it all in.  We spent the day on the strip going into and gambling at every casino and watched fireworks from our hotel afterwards.  We got ready and took a cab to the Palms so we could check out Rain, another club.  After waiting behind the velvet ropes for two hours we said screw it and hit the bar.  The one thing about Vegas is that everyone is extremely nice and everyone immediately has a topic on conversation to delve into "where are you from, and why are you here".  So we met some guys from Indiana, I think we crashed their party, then left and saw Woody Allen hop out of his limo.  I think I saw more limos than taxi cabs while there...  off to Hard Rock!  A lot of great people were there.  Poison was there.  We met some people and they were talking our pictures as if we were all good friends.  Then waiting near the bathroom some more people met up with us, one ended up being a DJ as well, so that was cool.  We went to gamble and these two guys came over to us and I swear they were psychic.  But they were awesome and I wanted to tlak with them more, so after a break, we went to the bar and met up with them again, along with another group of people.  We all had met that night but it felt like we all were hanging out and knew each other for much longer.  Russ and Rob, the psychic ones, seemed toknow everyone and spent the rest of the evening introducing us to everyone.  And they were shady on what they did...odd how everyone has a disguise there... ;-)  Introduced us to Trevor (or is it Brian...!? ;-) ) and Dan from the band, Ian Jones.  Hung out with them until we saw daylight and realized it was 5:30 am.  Damn.  Hit  up a cab, went to the hotel to take a nap, then off to catch the plane.  So yeah, the plane ride.  Again, I will reiterate how much I do NOT like flying.  The take off was really shaky for 45 minutes.  Shortly after I calmed myself down, the pilot, Captain Robinson, informs us that we will be going through a storm and wil hit major turbelence.  After the first shakiy minutes, the plane was nearly convulsing and I have a panic attack.  I start shaking and hyperventaling and crying.  I was rocking back and forth trying to catch my breathe.  I think it was the longest half hour of my life.  the poor flight attendents came to my aid which only made matters worse since I was so embarrassed.  So again, I calm down and I look out the window and see lightning.  Another panic attack.  Around North Carolina I was ok till the landing.  I nearly kissed the ground when I got off the plane... The wedding... It would have been great if the bridesmaids weren't snubbed by the family.  Congratulations to Kevin and Natalie, they're a great couple.  :-)  The wedding was beautiful, everything else was not.

      This week was chock full of saucy good music.   Wednesday was JOnasay and Monte Montgomery at the Northstar followed by a Thursday trek to NYC to see Jonasay, JJ Appleton, and an impromptu  Hootie and the Blowfish sing a long.  More on this later. I am at work and Chris just came back from the pizza place and brought me a breadstick.  Yay for food.

      One of my favorite parts of driving north is 495.  Its like a stretch of 10 miles that you can utilize to catch up on time and pass people.  I don't think I have ever seen a cop on there, let alone more than ten drivers at a time, and I know pretty much everyone acts as if its the Audobon.  So this makes me sad:  "State police will begin a seven-day campaign today against aggressive, unsafe and irresponsible drivers on I-495.   "Operation Calm, Safe and Sound" will draw several troopers from their regular duties to assist in the strict enforcement of traffic laws on the highway.   Troopers will look for speeders and drivers who follow others too closely, fail to use their turn signals or are too aggressive, spokesman Sgt. Walter Newton said.   Troopers assigned to the Commercial Motor Vehicle Inspection Unit also will patrol the highway to make sure large vehicles are driven safely. Police will use airborne enforcement methods and "unconventional cars" to spot violators, Newton said without elaborating. "

      AUGH!  I have a few things that bother me.  One is too much sameness, not enough randomness.  As I am watching the Rock Countdown on MTV 2 while checking my email, I have noticed that the number five through three videos ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL start on the same shot.  three different bands, three different directors, all the same shot.  I am an MTV2 junkie, constantly watching music videos, even if its on mute just to watch and gather technique and ideas.  Ew, Staind is number two.  Props to them for difference.  I still don't like them though.  Mute.  Other things that bother me, in no particular order: 1) loud girls (though when I get loud and obnoxious its ok...) 2) whininess 3) when the openness on pillowcases face in towards the center of the bed.. ("Laces out!!!) 4) gap commercials 5) jennifer lopez

      Never ever ever drink coffee from 7-11 unless you have to.  That was the worst thing I consumed today.  It even beat the rancid horseradish sauce that has probably been in my fridge for two years that I thought would be a good idea to have on my sandwich.  Wrong.  Looks like someone needs to go grocery shopping tomorrow.  I love my market, its chock full of gay older men smelling produce and comparing the nutrients in the various spelt wheat breads.  Very intriguing....  The movie "Loser" is on TV right now.  Very satisfying for my insomnia.  I love this movie, and it's soundtrack...and I also love Mena Suvari, she's stellar. I leave you with a quote from the movie to make you enjoy it as much as I do.  But not more so. "I love self-loathing complaint rock you can dance to."

      OMG!!! Don't be a creep.  I must have not looked at my calendar correctly this morning because I missed where it said that today was "Ask Miranda Out Day".  My normally icy self is used to blatantly denying the Rainbow creepies, but today was just humorous.  After pretty much ignoring this one guy and barely answering all of his questions he had about me, he slips me his business card and says to call him if I ever want to go out to dinner.  Which was tactful and ok and I would have just proceeded to toss the card, until his friend just busted out laughing and says "dude, she so won't go out with you."  Which made me laugh and then I felt bad.  Then there was the guy who wears the belt pack, yes, the same belt pack that was popularized a decade ago...how nifty, it's like a bang and a belt all in one...stylish, well he came in and asked if I would like to go to a movie with him tonight.  After I declined, he also informed me that he was about to move out of his mother's house...and into his aunt's house....and he is over forty.  And the high schooler who gets his friend to ask what I think of the other guy is always appreciated.  So cute.

      On Sunday I went to the East End.  That should pretty much answer your question about the title of this blog. Adam Brodsky, a Philly folk rock singer, is attempting to get into the Guiness Book of World Records by being the first solo performer to play all fifty states in fifty days.  See www.fiftyinfifty.com .  He kicked off this feat at the East End right here in good old Newark, so of course I had to go.   Our apartment is usually the number one stop for any pregaming action and Sunday was the last night that any pregaming would occur in 5208 due to Karen and me moving.  So the troops gather and the wine is opened.  Soon there after, the rum and vodka and a sad attempt at the whiskey.  Off to the East End, the happiest place on earth.  Or...the happiest place on earth within walking distance. Ok, let's establish the key players who were present...Karen, Aurora, Nate, Mike Clarke (somehow when you say his name, the first and last name go together), Doug, Marco, Taneeka, and "bitter looking girl" (I don't remember her name, but she was at our table and didn't look to happy to be there).  Oh, and Adam Brodsky.  Oh, and every freaking person that we called. So Tim calls to see if we were at the EE, so I tell him to get over there.  Apparently Adam didn't appreciate me being on the cell and tells everyone to be quiet and to stare at me.  Oh yeah.  Embarrassing.  So I proceed to tell Adam, in front of a packed venue, that it was ok, I was only trying to get more people to come.  So then this little incident becomes his topic of ridicule and everyone at the EE has a hoot at my expense.  It's ok though, I was laughing.  Then he dedicated a song to me and put me in the lyrics, so all is well now.  My little incident was a common theme in Adam's monologue the entire night.  I don't think my friends ever laughed so hard at me.  haha.  So that should have been my hint on not to touch cell phones.  After that little embarassing stint, Aurora, Karen, and I go outside and in the midst of our conversation decide that its a good idea to call nearly everyone in our phone books.  Not a good idea.  I think its really bad that I have more musicians than not musicians in my phone book.  So yeah, lets call EVERYONE.  We started with Phil (LDE) and ended with Steve (GTT).  Phil was the only one we had a specific message for and he understands and contributes to our randomness (the best on being -> :::in a british accent::: "Tidliwinks...this is Graham from the band Noasis..." and continues for like ten minutes on my v-mail).   Aurora and I also wreaked havok in the bathroom.  She broke the paper towel dispenser and I think I threw stuff over the stalls, though we both don't remember how or when or why.  Why do they let us roam out together!?!?  Hasn't everyone learned already that we disrupt everything we get into??!?! Mike Clarke drove Aurora and I back to my apartment, which is only two blocks away.  I guess he knew better.  Besides pregaming, my apartment is also known for its balcony which has been puked off of numerous times.  Rick holds the title of master balcony puker, and I wanted to take that crown away from him, but I didn't quite make it that far.  Damn.

      Tonight one of the greatest pranks was pulled off.  I am not going to write on whose brainchild it was, nor the strategy, but will tell you what happened....  So we're all at the White House talking and hanging out and not doing anything productive.  Karen and I go to Wawa while Epler goes to the studio.  Oh wait, no we don't.  We go to the parking lot instead and wait for Jay to get arrested for trespassing at the White House...  Dave, who Ed is good friends with and who I went to high school with was a Dewey cop as well as a UD Public Safety officer.  So he barges in the White House and asks Jay for ID since there have been a lot of break-ins in the area.  Dave proceeds to scour over the room with his flashlight and stops on the Captain who was chilling on the desk, minding its own business.  FRISK AND FIELD TEST TIME!!!  Against the wall and spread them!!!  While Dave was in the other room calling in Jay's info to the police, Jay text messages me telling me what was going on, as if we weren't outside the window trying to hear the hoopla.  Well, then Dave tells Jay that it is policy to cuff the suspect and bring them to the office...  Jays look when he came out of the WH in cuffs was priceless.  It was seriously like a ten minute ordeal in there.  SO we all laugh and good times were had.  I think Jay is still mad at us.    Come on, all is fair in love and war. :-D The TV station is built on laughter and poking fun.  It's like initiatiobn...like veryone has to drive with me at least once to be considered a crew member ;-) haha JK.

      Ok, so I DJed a folk show this morning.  The regular DJ is on vacation so I have been subbing the show in which I have received nothing but priase for my fine slection and knowledge of folk rock.  Little do the listeners know that my knowledge is very broad haha.  SO I found a cool folk cd form the Philadelphia FOlk Festival as well as a bunch of new folk cds that came in.  I make the listeners aware countless times that the regular DJ was out, and I am in, and what we were going to listen to.  Personnally I think that listening to the Philly live performances was way cool as well as hearing what just came out.   DAMMIT!!! I had countless callers call me up and tell me how awful I was.  WHO DOES THAT!???!?!  Ok, number one, the listeners of this show are mostly older, definitely not young punks who I would expect this from.  And number two, who proactively goes out of their way to tell someone how much they don't like them.  And three, I even said I wasn't the regular DJ so they should expect something other than the ordinary.  Asses.  Granted, I did not enjoy some of the music I played, but hell, it fit the genre and I was just doing what I was told.  I was told by the regular DJ to pick new things from the shelves and play them.  ARGH!!!  I did receive more compliments then complaints, but still, you remember the criticism.  Every caller who was negative towards me I asked if they had a request.  All declined.  Hey, I offered the invite to them to pick what I would play and they refused.  Fuck them.

      Happy Hour makes me happy. So Charise and I had a shitty day at work and we must then proceed to drown our sorrows at the East End.  I think I spend more time there than not.  But yay for dollar off drinks now before 9.  So after work, we speed over the the double E and down a few drinks before the right angle hits the clock.  Tuesday is also Karaoke night at the East End.  Rick and Melissa were also at the EE and we had a grand old time watching the people who crossed the state border (DE/MD) to partake in this glorious event.  I give those people credit, karaoke is something you can only do while not in a familiar town.  It was also a night to catch up.  On phone calls and in person.  Funny how fast the days seem to pass by....

      Ahh...the Lloyd Dobler Effect boys... where to begin, oh where to begin.   I admit that most of the events that occured will be omitted to protect the not so innocent.  So unless you were there...tough.  So Aurora, Tessa, and I hop in the car and drive to Kahunaville to catch the LDE show in our very own state.  Phil and I ply phone tag for 20 minutes as we try to find him so we can do the backdoor thing.  Unfortunately the back door was barricaded by a fence.  Over we go!  The jump was interesting and luckily no one got impaled.  So we see our favorite boys in the green room and crack open the beers.  Yay for 90 beers for 8 of us.  So we catch up and Aurora and I play pool against Donnie and Javi and loose horribly.  Ok, I lose horribly.  We decide that shotgunning a beer seems like a good idea.  Silly Phil and I get it all over ourselves because we forgot to drink out of the hole.  Oh geez.  So we all hang out on the couch of love then escort the guys to the stage.  There were people in mulltes dancing.  And of course, Aurora and I together is a garaunteed good time, so we then decide to make fun of the dancers and we start shaking our groove thangs.    The crowd is dead and we hate them.  Yeah and I also am not fond of a certain bald headed guy who found it necessary to talk shit about me every chance he got.  Dude, you don't even know me.  As if he reads this, but still.  Grow the fuck up and enjoy yourself.  The band gave Aurora and I shit for not travelling to see them as we do for other artists.  We never really thought of it, but we don't.  And we should because we have the most fun with them and they treat us the best.  So I promise, we will make it to a faraway state for you.  Yes Phil, we'd go to Alaska.  So we have these inside jokes with the band and everytime we see them, they must hint at our jokes with them on stage, and of course only two people laugh, Aurora and I, but it rocks.  Again, I have to censor myself here because I am not sure who reads this and who may get offended, but yeah...good times.  So yeah, other things happen.  I was just having fun, I swear...you all know I really am not like that....hey, all in good clean fun ;-)  Hey you know, we all try to have a good time.....  it even made the band's road journal...yeah.... "August 8th, 2003: Kahunaville, Wilmington, DE.  Hmmmmmm...If your name starts with an "M" (you know who you are) and you are reading this (you KNOW who you are), you have to know that I am seriously considering writing about how you were the REAL star of the show at Kahunaville tonight...BUT I don't know...you are such a wonderful person so maybe I'll just let things slide on this one (heh heh)."  Yeah.   Then Rusty locks his keys in the car.  What's with rockstars locking their keys in the car.  So Aurora and I have to share the story how Mark locked our keys in the car at 2 am in Maine.  Ok, it wasn't totally Mark's fault, we're all to blame.  It made for an interesting hour in the convenience store where we were gonna have sex in the bathroom.  So we leave after shairng stories in the parking lot with the guys and head to Dunkin Donuts.  Not sure how we really made it home, we flew, and Aurora and I have that to a science.  So into DD where we realize we are going to hell because we made fun of a lot of diseases tonight.  So we assumed that hell would be fun because we'd be together.  no, we'll probably be seperated to opposite ends of hell, and then it really would be awful.  oh and we saw a swift truck. SWIIIIIFTTTT HOLLLYYYYYY!!!!!!

      I know, I am a slacker, I haven't written.  I've been busy....honest! And deathly sick!! I think I have West Nile!!!  Well, I braved the plague and trekked to the Logan House to see LDE this past weekend.  I survived without dying.  I'll write more about that while at work tomorrow, but you can ready what Phil has to say.  And you should just go to their website anyways and see when they are playing near you and go and have fun.  August 22nd, 2003: Kelly's Logan House, Wilmington, DE.  Hey hey hey hey! Well, The Logan House has just opened their outside tiki bar. And, there was a thick odor of poop in the air in downtown Wilmington tonight. AND, I just opened a sentence with "and".  Well, here's some big news: OUR BASSIST, ROD GODINEZ, IS ENGAGED! Congratulations, Rod and Susan! Thanks for making the band feel really old (even though we are all in our late teens...Donnie is just now growing his first pubic hairs and my voice is in it's cracking stage). Our two sets tonight were "night and day" for several reasons. The first set was five people watching us (one of them was our favorite exhibitionist, Miss Miranda) and the second set was over a hundred people watching us (and Miranda was still sober).  I don't remember the set list tonight, partially because we didn't make one and the other reason is because Rod fed us some god-awful shot that was 20 ounces. After that terrible shot we kept repeating songs we had performed earlier in the night but that's okay because everyone kept dancing and some dude even went as far as to take his pants off and throw them behind the bar and then run down the stairs.  Interesting night at the Logan House. We'll see you all in Wilmington in a month or so...COME PARTY EARLIER!.  Phil

      Since someone likes to talk in their sleep....what little sleep was to be had (4 hours) wasn't really had until about 8 am where I got an hours worth of sleep after Mark and Justin left for B'more.  Aurora called my ass and woke me up at 9:30 so we could hit the road by 10.  Picked up Jen and Marissa and we were on our way down 95 South.  But not without a stop to Dunkin Donuts and Wawa first.  We were cursing the rain before we even left DE. So we dodged the raindrops on 95 and made it to Baltimore incident free.  Except for parking.  Ok, I go to Philly a lot and know that city like the back of my hand, and though I go to b'more for the inner harbor and fells point, I am not too familiar with that city, though it is almost equally as close.  Yeah and the parking sucks.  So we found this lot, that you just fold your money up and put it in the slot, its not computerized so ther eis no time count or anything.  And the slot to put the dollars in is the size of the width of a dime, so you literally have to roll the dollar to slide it through.  After 5 minutes of trying to figure the damn thing out and shove money in it to no avail, we found another lot, a block closer, and the same price, but easier. So we park and head to Camden Yards to start our morning off with Jonasay at the Taste of Baltimore.  We weren't going to go to this event until John Faye (of IKE) mentioned it to us at my concert on Labor Day.  Ike is great and we don't get to see them enough, so they were the deciding factor. So as soon as we find Jonasay, the rain starts and we get slightly soaked.  Jen had the revelation that this is a rare occasion that we see a band perform twice in less than 12 hours in two different states.  We missed some of their set, but it was enough to satisfy. After they played we decided to stroll around Camden Yards and check out this event they call Taste of Baltimore.  Oh yeah so awesome.  Every where you went you got free food and free stuff.  Our favorite were the balloons that said "Silver Spring, MD" on them.  The essence of SS, MD will be mentioned in an upcoming blog.  So we walk around and enjoy the festival, then its time for Ike. Ike is fantastic and definitely one of my favorite bands.  It started raining again and a nice guy let me use his umbrella.  Then it started to downpour so we all went under a ledge until Jen and I said screw it and we played in the rain and danced to Ike.  We made the band laughed when we shouted out Beautiful.  Cliff played the Christina cover at my show and it freaking rocked.  But yeah, played a long set full of musical goodness.   After Ike, we walked around some more and said goodbye to Aurora since she had to go to work.  Time to see Fountains of Wayne.  We were all really excited to see FOW perform since we really dig their studio albums.  What a disappointment.  Their live show blew.  Granted I love the music and think they're really talented, but there was a real lack of stage presence and desire.  They played about 7 songs and left with minimal crowd interaction.   That was made up for with Hootie and the Blowfish, who headlined.  Prior to the show we all admitted how great of an album Cracked Rear View was.  We were about 5 rows back and marissa got some awesome pictures.  The whole show was great.  They played a lot of the new album as well as some older classics.  Played for an hour and a half including two encores.  Their guitarist, Mark Bryan, was amazing.  Their whole stage presence was incredible and they were all so charismatic.  So good. The ride home was filled with conversation about bands and artists who love what they do and the loss of true heart in some commercialization of artists.  Its always good to have intellectual musical conversation.  So today was full of good friends, soaking wet dancing, and great music and heart.  Thank you.

      Ahhh...good old Logan House.  Not that Logan House is great or anything, but a lot of fun when you go with a group and you consume some premium malt beverages. Jonasay was headlining which means the girls all came out.  (writers note....ok, it seems like I don't listen to any other bands, but let me just state for the record that I do.  I am currently enjoying the new Some Girls, Rufus Wainwright, Vertical Horizon, Ike, and Fountains of Wayne albums. I do like other bands, I see other bands, but the past month has been a little dry due to my SARS) Ok, anyways... Logan House...and premium malt beverages.  Make for a fun time.  Lots of singing and lots of dancing.  We tried to corrupt Brittany by dancing all arund her, but the girl remained strong.   Oh yeah, and if you're a guy, at a bar...don't be creepy.  (See previous blogs)  Do not try to dance with me.  Do not try to talk to me unless I approach you.  You may be a nice guy and all, but if I want to communicate with you, I will.  Do not force me to lie and say I am a lesbian because you are being a creep.  Ew, and most of all, don't touch me.  But Jonasay played well, a little off, but still good nonetheless.  It was actually more crowded there last night than I have seen it in a while.  Good for them for staying strong and not playing mostly covers.  Unless I missed something, the only cover was Helter Skelter in the end.   Mark and Justin stayed over in my "cozy little room" for more like a nap than actual sleep before they had to hit the road to Baltimore at 8am.  Lucky me got to leave at 10 am.  Good times :-)

      So as soon as I get the hang of this alone domestic thing, my washer goes and explodes on me Thursday night.  There I am just washing my towels when all of a sudden water and foam was everywhere.  Yeah, 20 hours later everything was all dry and clean.  At least my apartment smells mountain air fresh.

      Oh my god, don't be creepy.  I love the Iota and most of you probably know that if an artist goes to the Iota, I would gladly drive there than Philly.  So I get out of my deathbed and Karen and I trek to Arlington, VA.  Poor girl had to deal with me coughing and my lack of voice nearly the whole trip.  But we saw a Swift truck so all was well.  We meet up with Mark and go inside to the wonderfulness that is Iota.  Ok, so by doing their DVD, I watched the people who were at that 9:30 club show incessantly since I worked on it for two months.  Since I don't know half of their names, we came up with nicknames to point out who people were while editing.  There was this one girl who kept apearing in Karen's "fan cam" and she was always dancing.  Not even to the beat, more like sawying and moving.  So we dubbed her "dancing girl".  Mind you, I have never spoken to dancing girl, the first time I even saw dancing girl was through the lens.  Dancing girl was at the Iota and felt the need to, point, yes, point, and stare and talk about me to her friend.  Now, it could have been all good things, such as "Wow, thats the girl who did the video stuff".  But since it went on all night, I doubt it.  So I don't know what dancing girls deal is.  Dancing girl kept it all to herself and her friends, where as two creepy guys did not.  Age is always the first thing that comes up, probably since Karen and I both look like we're 17.  Her and I both don't have a problem with age in guys, so this conversation really goes no where.  This where the guys then lie about their ages, then after a 5 minute game, it is revealed.  And still makes no difference, they are just being weird.  But at leats with younger guys, they aren't trying to be all touchy and whatnot.  So yeah, if you're a guy at a bar trying to pick up girls, don't be creepy.  And more than likely, if you are at a bar and trying to pick up girls, we don't want to be picked up at a bar anyways.    Oh yeah and then another group of guys.  And poor Karen is just so nice to everyone and I can be pretty icy, so they get half the hint and end up being confused.    And so we were getting ready to leave and then the guys come up to us and offer to take us back to their place cuz they know we want it.  Ok NO.  Four up, four down.  The we hit up DC again the next weekend.  DC is always a good time.

      So I moved into my new place and living by myself has been...interesting.  At least in 5208 I had my girls to keep me in check and make sure I didn't burn the house down.  So far I have had a flood and I punched my window out.   My shower faucet decides it doesn't want to turn off and I had no idea how to fish it.  Banging it with a hammer just made it worse.  I don't think I even need to write anymore, you get the picture....But I found the mains so I just use them now :-)  Yay for being crafty. My washer is in my bathroom and my dryer is in the kitchen, but hey, at least I have them.  So the first time I decide to do laundry here ended up with blood.  Who knew being so domesticated could end up so violent?  You know that tube that comes out from the back of the dryer?  Well I had to put that tube outside of the window.  What does that tube actually do?!  I couldn't get my window open (these windows are probably as old as the building which is about 150 years old I think...) so I bang on the sides to loosen the window.  I guess I bang a bit too hard and my hand goes right through the window.  Oh well, the tube fit nicely through my fist hole.

      Yeah I know. Ok, let's see what I have been up to... I went to see Radiohead :-D  Oh yay. I took Nate for his birthday and we met Michelle up in the parking lot.  I told Nate that now I can die complete now that I have seen Radiohead.  Little did I know we would almost get in a car accident three times on the way up.  Oh wait, I should have known....it was me driving...but it wasn't my fault!! The one incident that sticks out the most is when the mack truck almost rear ended me on the bridge.  I swear I have no idea how he stopped on time.  But the concert was excellent and good times were had by all.

      Brittany is blaming for me Isabel's wrath because I mocked the storm, or lack there of.  Isabel got back at us by wreaking havoc in the early morning.   From my one window that faces the street, I don't see any flooding or trees down.  Yay.  We lost power three times last night, but luckily, I am a girl, thus I own a myriad of candles.  My apartment was dark no more.

      So apparently stamps rose in price.  From $.34 to $.37.  When the hell did this happen!?!? I guess its been a while since I have mailed something that wasn't prepaid or metered.    And why is there no cent sign on the keyboard?  The c with the vertical line through it.  Wasn't it on typewriters?  They probably replaced the cent sign with this sign: @  because when do you actually use that sign besides email? Or when does anyone ever use this sign: ^.  I don't think I have ever used that sign.  Or how about this one: |  WTF is that!?!?! No, it isn't a lower case L, it's the symbol that is typed when you press the front slash button and shift.  The cent sign is much more useful than that vertical line.    The next line of keyboard should have smiley face buttons on them as well.  So instead of three keystrokes, you have your emoticon in one.

      The new Some Girls album makes me wanna jump around my apartment.  I love it.  Yesterday was another open to close day at the record store.  But Chris and I pass the time by talking about people and sharing our obscenities in front of our customers.  Perhaps we should really tone it down or watch what we say in front of others.  Not that we lead scandelous lifestyles, but we always talk about what we would do if we had guts haha. After work I went to the White House (for all of you non STN freaks, the WH is where the video editing stuff is).  Damn, its pretty sad that I just go there to hang out haha.  Karen and Jay were there so I bothered them.  We went to Wawa to get dinner and the whole trip there and back I think Karen and I fully verbally violated Jay with all of our X-rated talk.  He banished the two of us hanging out together with him.  The highlight of the night though was Karen and I attacking him and trying to paint his nails.  I swear the boy must now have a fear of the WH.    I can't find my favorite blue shirt with the stars on it.  Sadness.

      Wow, almost a month.  I suck.  Chris is across the street getting me a raspberry iced tea.  He doesn't suck  Alright, highlights of my last few weeks.  I just feel very fortunate in the position that I am in right now.  The last few weeks have been a whirlwird of fun and excitement and I can't even begin to conceptulaize how amazing this next month is going to be.  By reading, you will find a common theme....  So Marissa, Amanda, and I head down to Dewey the last weekend in September for a music conference.  Each conference gets crazier and crazier, so needless to say, I was really excited.  We make it down to the beach around 4 and check into the Marina Suites.  Oh yeah, the difference between a motel and a hotel.  We established the difference last Dewey Beach Conference, where we discovered that we actually had soap and shampoo and a working clock, and the GTT boys did not.  We got ready for dinner, unpacked some stuff, made some phone calls, and headed out to the Rudder.  Marissa had brought some film equipment for Center Stage and had 6 bands lined up to be interviewed and we were also going to film their performance.  Hence the reason for being there....of course not partying and meeting awesome people.....its all about the business ;-) So we ate dinner at the Rudder and met up with Paul Lewis at the coffeeshop.  En route I literally ran into Jamie from Omnisoul.  They rock and it was cool running into them.  Listened to their new stuff and it is tizzight.  :-)  Check them out at www.omnisoul.com .  So lets seeeeeeeeeeee......  Starting talking to the James Harvey guys before we even knew they were James Harvey guys.  Really nice and their music is really good.  James Harvey is classically trained and his voice is simply amazing.  Also met up with Fools and Horses, Capitol Air, and Stargazer Lily to film and interview them.  Marissa and Amanda were filming and doing the interviews while I braved the crowds and filmed the shows.  The girls stayed at the Rudder since they were already in and I headed to the Cork to see Ken and Steve (GTT) since the girls couldn't get in there.  The Cork was pretty filled up and I found Gilligan, so all was good.  The guys started off with Better (my used to be favorite GTT song) and played some old and new stuff.  My new favorite GTT song is Dear Urgency.  You will like it too.  FIlmed about 15 minutes worth of the show then put the camera down so I could watch from not behind the lens.  Steve and Kenny were pulling the White Stripes thing.  Dave and Chris couldn't make it, but still a great performance.  They ended with Woman Like a Man by Damien Rice.  Incredible. So they ended and I heard from Marissa and Amanda and she were ESCORTED out of the Rudder by a BIG HUGE bouncer.  He took them pass the whole conference while he carried the cameras.  Oh my.   So they were waiting for me at the hotel....then the afterparty....  SO I meet up with the girls and we head to Grottos.  Grottos is a necessity any time we're at the beach.  Like the motto, it's tradition.  As we're walking there, Marissa is tlaking to the Fools and Horses guys (from now on will be referred to as FAH) and we randomly meet them in the parking lot before Grottos.  So we all (me, Marissa, Amanda, Bill, Tim, Matt, and Kent) eat and hit the liquor store then back to 216.  Somewhere between before and then I called up Steve to tell him and the posse the game plan.  Geez, where to now.  So we are all in 216 playing drinking games with terrorist cards.  ASS!  We had to say "ass" at the end of every sentence, per Amanda's rules, so that was entertaining.  The fridge was full of "Sir Coors Orginal" (that's a FAH saying ;-) ), wine coolers, twisted tea, and various sorts of liquor and sodas.  Sweet.  James Harvey Band and the GTT guys came around shortly after.  As did the cop.  Instead of trying to write in any sense of order, I will just point out the highlights.... -Grammy nominee David Ivory coming into our party looking for Rotoglow -The butt munchie rent a cop -Steve showing me card tricks :-) -consuming lots of premium malt beverages -missing a horse...and a girl... -Kent running around mostly naked screaming "sexy nipples!" -The whole room getting silent while Damien Rice was performing, then again for the School of Rock -Tasting the Rainbow and not throwing it -The whole GTT interview, which I was gladly a part of haha -Steve: is she going to air this Me: Shhh....no Steve: Marissa, are you going to air this Marissa: Yes, of course Steve: I hate you. Me: You love me Marissa: Yeah, I'll edit this Steve: YOU CAN'T EDIT THIS!!!!!  Just great times with old and new friends :-) Went to bed at 5 am and woke up at 8 am to drive 87 miles back to Newark so I could open and close the record store....and though i was begged, I didn't think I was going to go back that night...  Caffeine got me through the morning, where as a phone call got me through the evening.  Marissa calls me up and tells me that they are staying and just figuring out what to do later.  So we decide that hanging out in Dewey for another night was crucial.  I get out of work a little early, hit up the gas station, and head back down to the beach.  Insane.  :-)  So I give Marissa a call when I get down there and meet the girls and the FAH guys ... somewhere, no idea where.  We end up at their room at some hotel.  Again, I can't remember.  I call Steve and let him know what we're up to, then its card game time.  We watched the suckiest SNL ever and played games.  Good times.  Then it was time to brave the rain and head over to the Sea Esta where the James Harvey Band and Green To Think rooms were. Odd ly enough, both bands were neighbors and conveniently met in our room the night before.  One of the greatest things about Dewey is that you walk outside and the music from the clubs infilterates the streets.  At the GTT room we drink and take scandelous pictures and stay there since the police are right outside the door.  Why why why do they like to follow us?!?!?!?  We left around 4ish or so to go back to the FAH room to get our stuff, we had no idea where we were going to stay, but we knew they had to get up early, so we wanted to get our things out of there.   Tim was already up, talking to the guard, and let us in the room where we meetup with the other three horses who INSISTED on leaving for Baltimore early and having us stay in their rooms.  We couldn't let them do that, but they made us.  We couldn't beleive that they checked out of their room early just so we had a place to stay.  They wouldn't even let us carry their equipment down.   So again, went to bed at 5 am, wke up at 9, worked the record store from 11-6.   But it was all so very very worth it :-)

      I despise being grounded and find inspiration in randomness.  I received an e-mail from PMB about a free intimate show in Boston where they will also be filming for extra footage on their upcoming CD.  I had to go.  no way I was missing this in one of my favorite cities.  If you are reading this blog, you more than likely know me, and if you know me, you know how important PMB has been in my life... Aurora and I have been long overdue for a road trip to catch up on things, and fortunately we didn't get it out of our systems en route to Virginia.  We left around 10 am made our usual trip to Wawa for coffee, pretzels, and cash.  Game on. In the 340 miles it took to get to beantown, we saw over 30 Swift trucks, and no Burger Kings or Dunkin Donuts on the road.  What gives.  In the player was: Graham Colton, Green to Think, the Virginia Mix CD, Fools & Horses, John Mayer, and crap, I forgot the rest.  So we make it to Boston and I want to kiss the ground, though Aurora wouldn't let me.  I grew up in New Hampshire and Boston is one of my favorite cities and I don't get to visit it often enough.  As soon as we hit the outskirts of the city, the directions seems to name roads that weren't there.  Go go gadget memory.  Surprisingly I was able to navigate our way through the town with only a brief distraction at BU.  I wanted to get there early to make sure we got in and had a decent spot.  If you've ever been to a PMB show with me, you know how I get.... But no one was there, so I gave Aurora a carview tour of the city.  Apparently I forogt that it was rush hour.  Oh what fun.  We went to get gas, we were amazed on the lack of gas stations in the city, and the guy behind me smelled really good.  That detail isn't really pertinent to the story, but I wanted to point that out.  He was wearing Curve.  good god, if you wear Curve, you're done for.   So we park at some BU lot and walk to the Paradise.  Yay for Boston.  We pass the PMB bus as Chardy and Pat walk out and we all say hello.  Chardy said he heard I was coming up....hmmm...I wonder how ;-).  We stand in line and meet some people.  One of my favorite aspects of PMB shows is just the wonderful people you meet a long the way.  The PMB posse definitely has the most diehard and passionate fans and a good time is always had by all.  Its like a little family :-) Jeremy, who we met later, interviewed me in line, so hopefully I didn't sound too much like a dumbass.  Here I am working in TV, and once the record button is pressed, I turn into a bumbling idiot.  Proves that I belong behind the camera instead of in front of, haha.   So the show was great.  GREAT!  The whole room was full of such love, heart, and energy.  I have never been to a more exciting and passionate show.  They played for about 2 hours and forty minutes, with special guest Michael ghegan on keys and sax.  Setlist was: Save Me, Lost, Must Have Been, Radar, Runaway, Annabelle, Now, Haven't Seen, Girl from Athens, You & I, Rebecca -> No Woman No Cry -> Rebecca, Where the Streets Have No Name, (ENCORE >> ) Shine, Don't Give Up, You & I (again for audience chorus for cameras), (2nd ENCORE >>) Hero, Passion, She Talks to Angels, Sympathy for the Devil.  WOW. It was an early show that ended around 11:30 pm.  Everyone piled out into the sidewalk and watched the Sox / Yanks game on the huge bigscreen TV from the window at the bar next door.  Ghegan came up to Aurora and I and we said our hellos, but not goodbyes.  We hang with Chardy for a while and try to get Aurora into the bar.  No such luck, so off to the bus we go.  The bus was parked right in front of the bar, so we go from the bus to the bar throughout the night.  pat was plastered and sung karaoke all night.  It was great.  In the bus, we rocked the Tribe and received city dance lessons from Ghegan.  We talked with Jeremy about the video and it should come out pretty nicely.  Lots and lots of editing.  So yeah, lots of good times in the bar and the bus with the guys, plus new friends J-Mo and Malibu.  After the bar closed, everyone was in the van rocking out to Metallica.  I'm surprised the bus still has shocks left.  It was time for the the bus to roll out, and though Pat was begging me to stay, while Aurora was having some fun of her own..., it was time to see if my car was still there and not towed.  Pat followed us out, and as I was trying to figure out how the hell we were getting out of Boston, this guy started giving me directions.  During his directions I just look at him and ask if he was Morgan, and then he realized who I was.  odd that we have known each other for like 5 years, but never met.  See how PMB brings everyone together haha.  So we all say our goodbyes and I take Morgan home and we finally hit 95 south around 4ish AM.   Aurora divulges her scandelous behavior and I knock her hat off (she was wearing a Graham Colton hat, who she is infatuated with) and I wouldn't let her listen to the GCB cd.  It was the greatest night ever and can't beleive all that had happened and for brevity's sake and to protect the innocent I surely did not write about all that had happened. We hit traffic around Connecticut and I again, have another bout of road rage.  I didn't think I would be able to make it over the Tappenzee, but we did and around 8 am we found a rest stop and slept for a half hour.  hit more traffic in Jersey and made it home around noon.  Stupid traffic. So I showered, took, a nap, then went to work at 2pm.   Wonderful.

      Last Wednesday I went to Boston, Friday was NYC.  I'm lovin' it.  I'll blog about those trips when I get back tonight.  Going to Philly.  Hey now, I get two days off a week, I am going to enjoy them! ;-)   We're all heading up to the Northstar tonight to film Ari Hest.  Another great thing about living in Newark is that I still get to play with the Center Stage and STN kids :-).   Right now I am listening to the *new* Matt Nathanson CD.  He is one of my favorite artists, so of course, I have to love it, but this CD is nearly flawless.  This is the song I am listning to now, and by the time I cut and paste, it will be over.   curve of the earth    I tried to come down from you I tried with your voice in my head Knocking me back Every inch I moved I'm a sucker for a good lie The way you say you understand and how you always talk of catching me but never open up your hand  Tell me does the world revolve the same Tell me do the people all take care of you Did you doubt the curve of the earth And every word.. Every word I'll bet you heard  I know you hear me catch your breath But I'm not listening for the right words anymore I'll take what's left You're vicious like the blue sky Right before the rain comes pouring through Tell me does he look like me at all Cause they're all an awful lot like you  Tell me does the world revolve the same Tell me do the people all take care of you Did you doubt the curve of the earth And every word.. Every word...  Tell me does the world look all insane Tell me how the people all just scare you Did you doubt the curve of the earth And every word.. Every word... I'll bet you heard  Tell me does the world revolve the same Tell me do the people all take care of you Did you doubt the curve of the earth And every word.. Every word...  Tell me does the world look all insane Tell me how the people all just scare you Did you doubt the curve of the earth And every word.. Every word... I'll bet you heard Did you doubt the curve of the earth Did you doubt the curve of the earth

      I think this is part 4, I lost count.  I have no heat.  I have radiators, but apparently nothing is coming out of them since I nearly froze last night.  I started a tiny inferno with my plethora of candles.  That didn't work, so I turned on the oven and opened the door.  Is that safe?  Worked wonders.  My apartment is cold no more.

      Ha!  So I had every intention about the Graham Coltoness enjoyed three times in one week in my previous blog, but I got distracted.  Graham Colton Band and Ike played at the Stone Balloon for mug night on Oct. 2.  I always enjoy shows that I can walk to.  Key players are myself, Karen, Jen, and Laurie.  Talked with Jim Johnson and John Faye before the show then found a decent spot in front of the sound board.  It's always comforting to see original bands playing at the Balloon, lets one know that there is still hope and faith in rock n' roll in this town.   It was hard to tell how the crowd would react to an original band taking the stage.  There were a ton of people there, who would probably be there regardless on who was on stage due to the essence of mug night.  But for the most part, they were into it and respectable.  Again, a great show.  I lost my friends, but John found me and we checked out the show and made fun of the drunken asshole yelling next to us.  I guess others were fed up as well and its the first time I ever saw fans heckling each other at a rock show haha.   Good times.  GCB again...  that Saturday, Aurora and I hit up 95 South to see GCB and Jonasay play at the State Theatre.  Last time we did this, the trip was 8 hours, 2 hours was much more comforting.  We felt bad the entire trip though.  Phil, from LDE, always gets on our case for travelling to see bands (such as Graham Colton Band and Jonasay.....) instead of them.  LDE isn't very fond of our choices, and we should go and see them more, they treat us the best out of most of the bands we see.  Not "treat" us the best, but times spent with them are always enjoyable and entertaining.  Though we don't go more than what is accessible to us to support them.  So here we are going 100 miles away to see the two very bands that they aren't fond of us seeing, and they are playing 10 miles away.  Phil still hasn't returned our phone calls.  We'll see on the 17th ;-)  We're sorry!!! So yeah, we get to the venue and catch most of Jonasay's set, except for Wish, we walk out on that one.  Nothing personal.  Oh oh oh EW! I almost forgot.  Apparently some of the Jonasay regulars don't enjoy us, or maybe its me since Aurora hasn't been able to make as many Jonasay shows.  What's your deal?  If you're going to spend the whole set looking back or over at me then talking about me to someone (yeah yeah yeah whatever, it happens at nearly every show, or else i am being totally paranoid, which i doubt) at least come over and say hi.  I don't bite.  Or maybe I will.  Chomp. GCB played great as usual.  Best GCB show we have seen, surprisingly not many people there.  Such an underrated band.  I'm sure they'll be another John mayer, where we try to expose everyone we know to this wonderful bamd, and they will ignore us until they actually hear them on the radio.  Yeah, because thats a justiable measure on an artist's worth.  Fuck you Clear Channel.

      So yeah after a weekend of straight drinking and good times, Karen and I hit up the Red Fish in Fells Point for our usual entertainment of Michael and Mark.  How is it that there I have 2 drinks and two shots and become plastered.  Yeah, worst ride home ever.  Ok, not ever, but in a while.

      The Sunday that I got back from Dewey, Aurora and I drove up to Philly to see Graham Colton perform at The Fire.  The last time we saw the band play was when we went to NC where they played the Cat's Cradle with Jonasay.  Basically, way too long ago.  GCB played a lot of new songs.  The sound was off though, full fledged band playing acoustically.  It was The Fire, not them.  But a great setlist and happiness haha.   We took pictures during and after, I'll post those as soon as I get them in... I haven't seen or talked to Ryan in months (check him out, www.ryancohen.com)  and he and Leah were at the show to see Tom McRae.  A pleasant surprise.  Odd where time takes you. After the show, we met up with Chris (who I met at Dewey, a high school friend of Steve's) and debated on what to do next.  The show finished early, and here we are ready to take on the city at 11 pm.  Does anyone else find it odd that PA liquor stores do not carry beer? WHY WHY WHY?  Not that this is an issue, but it is still pondersome.   So we go to Chris's house (on the way... "yo, we're in Jersey....").  After an hour and drinking and music talk, we head back to DE.   I swear after this whole weekind, I am surprised my liver hasn't keeled over and died.

      AUGH!!  How could I forget to write about the Ari Hest show!?!? So Center Stage filmed Ari at the Northstar Bar on Tuesday and it was so wonderfully good.  The Northstar is by far my favorite venue.  Especially to film in, its always a stress reliever when the venue actually appreciates you being there instead of being in the way (::cough:: ::cough:: Recher ::cough:: Deer Park ::cough:: ::cough::).  It was the first CS taping I have been too where I haven't been frazzled since I wasn't producing, I was just being creepy and tagging along for tech support ;-).  We met up with Mackenzie, who we met in DC and hung out with her for a bit.  Crazy that she is in half of the CS crews' comm classes.  The show went so incredibly well except for some minor difficulties, such as not having a program monitor.  But Marissa handled it like a pro and I can't wait to see the footage. And of course, you know a CS road trip isn't complete without some drama on the road.  We got lost and it took us three hours to get home from Philly.  We took the scenic route.  Yeah.  Aurora nearly killed us because she ran a red light.  But the highlight of the treacherous scary rainy ride home was the new pumpkin spice cappuccino at Sunoco.  Yes, Sunoco does its hot beverages right.

      October 17 Aurora and I owed the LDE guys.  Big time.  We ditched their show to see Graham Colton Band & Jonasay.  We hang our heads in shame....  So we head to the Funk Box!  Fools & Horses, who Amanda, Marissa, and I met at Dewey, were opening up for Lloyd Dobler Effect.  Hell Yeah!  So we load up the cars (Aurora, Marissa, Amanda, Meg, and myself) and hit up I-95 south.  But first a stop at Wawa where Marissa made her first coffee :-).  We get to the scary section of Baltimore, park, and drink in the parking lot.  The Funk Box is now one of my favorite venues.  Just a cool atmosphere and very clean.  Aurora and I see Rusty on the second floor and go say  hi, then hit the green rooms, which were purple.  Say hi to everyone there.  As soon as Phil saw us, he forgave us and said that as soon as he saw the listing for the State Theatre (Graham and Jonasay), he knew we weren't coming.  At least he looks out for us.  So we crack open a few drinks and catch up.  I go downstairs to see the rest of Folls and Horses, then bring Marissa upstairs to meet everyone.  Matt played a few solo songs, so Bill and Tim ran upstairs and surprisingly ran into us.  They then told everyone up there that its usually the bands who try to find floors of places to sleep on, but it was reversed in Dewey, where it was the girls trying to find a place to stay and them letting us use their place and they left early.  Very entertaining to all there haha. LDE put on a great show.  March was the last full fledged LDE show we have seen, we won't count the LH shows.  After we headed out to the Fools & Horses house.  Aurora and I left around 3 am to head home since we both had to wake up early Saturday morning for Homecoming.

      October 13 I see all of my close friends all of the time and talk to them nearly everyday, so there was no need for a "celebration".  Especially since my birthday "gifts" were the road trips I took travelling up and down the East Coast in those few days.  Plus, nothing can beat Boston ;-). Well, since Karen and I go to Baltimore every Monday, we figured my birthday should be no different.  We USED to go to see Michael and Mark play at the Red Fish, but en route, Mark called and said they weren't playing and we were hitting up the bars instead.  Score.  So we did.   Mocking Michaels running was the highlight of my night ;-).  And I think if he picked me up and spun me around again, I would throw up.  I handled myself ok.    Karen bought me a flask.  Best gift ever.  I'm going to decorate it.

      Aurora and I drove to New Jersey. We got lost. We saw a show. We were disappointed (but not about the show). We almost ran out of gas and were almost stranded. We witnessed an accident at 3 am and called 911. We were silent and had sad faces for the rest of the car trip home. We saw the PMB bus on I-95 in Delaware. We smiled. :-)

      Retrogressing to October 10  So Jen and I decided to head up to NYC for the evening to see some old friends and, of course, to support Steve at  his solo debut at CBGB's. Where to even begin......... how about the insane amount of traffic on I-95 and taking 45 minutes to even get out of the state of Delaware?! En route, Jen and I finally caught up on all of our stories and saw 22 Swift trucks on the way.  Always a good sign, or was it...?   Traffic was bad and took yet another hour and a half to get throught the Lincoln Tunnel.  If Jen's white knuckles grasping the handles were any indication of my aggressive driving, then I would say I was victorious.  Steve was supposed to hit the stage at 7 and we were under the tunnel at 6:45.  Hellloooo NYC.  I thought it was pretty funny that there is a sea of yellow NY taxis and my little black Cabrio zipping through them.  We're heading down Bleeker and Steve's show would probably be near over so I give him a call expecting to get v-mail to tell him we'd meet him later.  Incidently, theclub was having an inspection and Steve's show was pushed later.  The whole crew was out at CBGB's and Steve (and occassionaly Dave) played a really good set.  Despite the radio coming in through the monitors, but we'll just ignore that.   After the show, we loaded up Steve's SUV then headed out for pizza.  Steve passed my test of city driving.  He is nearly as aggressive as I am, though he is more verbal ;-).  After dinner, we went to a bar...forget the name...and met up with everyone again.  It was Gilligan's girlfriend's (Lillian) birthday.  Mike Clarke (longtime DE friend) met up with Jen and I at that bar with his friends, then we headed out to find a cab and some bars in the Village.  I think we scared the taxi man.  Loud, drunk, and obnoxious.  But hey, at least I didn't have to do what I did before when I hung out with Mike to get a taxi haha.  We end up at a bar called Peculiars when Aurora called and Mike claimed that he will be her sugar daddy.  That's all I remember from that ten minute phone call.  After a few drinks there, we decided to head to Steve's place.  Though we had no idea where the hell we were, a few blocks later we found my car.  Lucky.   So Steve tells me to call him after I get out of the Lincoln Tunnel.  Would have been great if I could even find the Lincoln Tunnel.  So I take the Holland instead.  So Steve is navigating via phone and I don't know how I kept missing all the streets he told me to go down.  Oh well, twenty minutes later we were there haha.   So we crash and wake up to go to the chinese restaraunt for lunch.  Nothing like starting the day with Chinese food.  Always welcomed.  We marvelled at the tree cutter demolishing branches and leaves outside the window.  That machine is so badass.   We said our goodbyes and then back to DE.  :-( Jen, remind me if I left naything out or if you can remember any of the inane things we said.  I know I know, I waited to long.  I suck.

      I find solace in the perfectly crafted cup of peppermint tea, and realize that its one thing thats tangible and makes absolute sense right now.  While Michelle was in college, we were best friends and nearly inseperable.  She graduated a year before me and unfortunately time and space has taken a toll on our friendship, but that unwritten law of loyalty remains and we always pick up where we left off, which is never far from the path from which it originates.  After the Michael W. Smith show, I headed up to Iron Hill to meet up with her and Tim.  I think that even years from now, apparently the magic number is 30 - the age I will be when I finally give Tim his CDs, we'll find each other still lost within our direction and still looking for guidance and humor in one another.  There will always be beer, asses to check out, and critiques on other peoples' clothing.  It's comforting to know that someone else, specifically Michelle, has been sharing the feelings of despair and exhaustion and confusion that I have been going through.  We've always said that thing shave worked out for us, for the better, and without any effort.  And granted we like the be challenged and thrive on competition and being the best that we can be in whatever we do, but its frustrating when you do not know where your efforts are being recieved and you just can't try anymore.  And you wonder if its even worth it.

      It was raining in New York City on a Monday, and I walked around barefoot.  There was a girl on the corner of Sixth Ave huddled in her blanket crying and shaking.  I was watching her from across the street waiting for the light to go from don't walk to walk wondering what was going through her mind.  We all have feelings were we just want to break down no matter where or who in front of, and what possibily could have happened in her life that effected her so much at that moment.  As I am crossing the street, the first person that walked past her kneeled down, held her, and asked her why.  It was saddening to think that that occurence probably wouldn't have happened in Newark, but I witnessed such beauty in the largest and busiest city in America.

      I really should blog more often, but I don't.  So deal.  The Saturday after the Loop was Aurora's Birthday Bash.  Still not 21, but at least she isn't a teenager anymore ;-).  I opened up the record store, then headed out in the afternoon to get the girl and head to Lums Pond.  It was such a beautifully nice day that we took the top off and blasted our bands top notch on 896.  Marlon Spike was playing a benefit at the park so we stopped by for a few songs.  Was it bad that we drank and Aurora wanted to smoke at a Health Fair?  When we first got there, Aurora saw this booth that said "Treasure Your Sexuality", though she thought it said "Measure Your Sexuality" and she got excited.  Afterwards we visited Melissa, who called in the morning to tell us she was on crutches due to her drunken fall at the loop.  Then back to my place for some pre-party festivities.  We panicked because we couldn't find anything that came in with a clear broadcast of the football game (UD vs. Maine), but were relieved when we heard the Blue Hens still remain undefeated.  Man, we rock.    Jen picked us up at my place to head to Tylers.  Not without making a scene in front of Rainbow though, I swear I don't think the girl has any front tires left. ;-)  The entire trip to Tylers was spent singing loudly to bad radio songs and me on the phone with Mark and Steve trying to give them directions to the Logan House.  I enjoyed how Steve called me every 5 minutes to tell me what exit he's at.  And he trusts me with directions after I missed 3 exits to his place last time?  Just kidding ;-).  There are two things I am not good at...things that pertain to the stove, and the road.  In regards to everything else, I am a supergenius. So we hit up the Logan House in full force, early though so we could play the backdoor trick so Aurora could get in.  So we all catch up and talk music junk and drink and its fun.  Steve played a good solo set in front of a pretty responsive crowd, so that was encouraging.  Chris came shortly before the end of Steve's set, and we played the introduction game.  Boyce's Road put on a good energetic show.  Jen bought the cd, haven't listened to it yet.  Caught some of Jonasay's show before Chris and I headed out to Aurora's... Aurora and I were tlaking about how crazy it would be because its the meeting of several forces...tv people, home people, music people, ud people, random people, yeah.  But a good time was had by all.  I think the flip cup game at the end was the highlight.  I don't drink beer, and I certainly don't drink beer that fast, but I did.  Ugh.  Chris was playing with the Captain and Steve with water.  We had a mixed team.  The guy who we were playing didn't want to stop playing - ever.  4:30 AM, Justin left for DC, Steve for Pennsauken, Eric went roaming around the state of DE, Chris and I to Rainbow, and Aurora was left obliterated at her place.  A perfect sign of a good birthday.   And of course I had to open the store in the morning.  Silly Sundays...

      The White Album is playing in the store now -- as is the new Wheat, the Lost Highway Compilation, and the new Ryan Adams  -- and Revolution is playing.  This song now reminds me of New Years Eve last year at the House of Blues in Myrtle Beach.  And I smile.

      I am stealing Jen's blog, then adding my own thoughts because its a lot easier to cut and paste someone's thoughts that were a lot fresher when they wrote it, then trying to recall... Jens blog can be found here in its completeness: www.livejournal.com/users/sheilahmcpaste  The Halloween bar loop in Wilmington! Featuring: LAURIE as The Butterfly KAREN as Can-can girl MIRANDA as The Scandalous Winged Woodland Creature MELISSA as Greek Goddess NATE as Hula girl and JEN as The Spooky Spider Lady  We hit two bars around Logan House, one was full of people twenty years older than us and the other had Melissa and Miranda and I pinned to the ledge the whole time. On the way to bar #2 we were talking about the 48 year old lady who had the same wings as Laurie, and how bitchy she was being, saying "My mask is better, you're not authentic, I've been here longer" and how she should have said in reply "Yeah you've been here twenty years longer". Then we look up to see Miranda and Melissa running down the street, Miranda trying to lift her ass onto a covered motorcycle on the sidewalk, the alarm going off, and the two of them running down the rest of the street. Fabulous :)  Logan House had an hour wait, so we decided to pile in Nate's car and head for the Waterfront. First though, Melissa had to pee, so her and Miranda ran up the steep hill by the parking lot to do their duty. Next thing I know Melissa's trying to walk down and ends up rolling down the hill at top speed onto my feet. Classic. Turns out our poor buddy was pretty hurt when the buzz wore off, and is on crutches. Hang in there Aphrodite! Kahunaville was fun, Miranda wiping out on the sidewalk in front and exposing all was even more fun. Next was Iron Hill, where I violated Melissa and Karen and I spent some quality time in the bathroom. My Halloween buddies say that I'm a good drunk :-D Good drunk or not, the "Vamprie Shot" that Miranda and I finished with completely did me in, and I'm completely gone still. Fantastic!  Word of the night: SCANDALOUS  Yeah, that pretty much sums that night up.  Except that I don't think I was running as much as Jen said I was.  And I don't know why I tried to get on the motorcycle...it was there and it wanted a rider.  As soon as I tried getting on it (the operative word there is "tried") a pansy ass alarm went off.  Woo Woo Woo!!  Pansy enough to make us high tail it to Scratch McGoos though.   Also, I will explain Melissa's injury further.  Melissa had to go to the bathroom so I told her to go in the woods instead of waiting in line somewhere else, and I told her I would go up the treacherous hill with her if she needed.  So we go up the mountian, in privacy, since where she was standing there was no privacy.  We're up the hill and the next thing I know, I see this little white and gold toga careening down the hill and stopping abruptly in front of the car.  Man, that was the funniest thing that night.  Poor Melissa!!!  So we pile in Nate's car and go to Kahuna.  Melissa does the Percolater (its a bad bad bad dance from the middle school era) quite well for being an itty bitty white girl.  I honestly think that's how she sprained her ankle, not falling down a hill.  After Kahuna we walked to Iron Hill, where I proceded to walk just fine.  I don't know how I busted ass, but the next thing I know I am on the ground, and it was so funny because I didn't trip or anything, it was a perfetly flat surface.  And on the way back up, the crew saw a lot more than I intended.  Sorry guys. At Iron Hill Jen and I did this shot, which not a smart idea.  Vampire Shot from Hell it should have been called.  Plastered at this point, so there is no where else to go but the diner.   Enough to go home, sleep a few, then work the record store....

      Thursdays are always long, but often times an upcoming fun weekend gets me through. I worked open to close, then the crew hit up the East End to support Marlon Spike.  Pregaming happened at my place then walked in the blustery tundra to the EE.  If you are a regular to my journal, you will know that I think the EE is one of the happiest places on Earth.  Along with Wawa.  Totally blows Disney out.   If we weren't already drunk, we definitely pushed our limits there.  Marlon Spike put on a really awesome show and a highlight was the good times we had in the audience.  It was a massive group of us who were just spread out at the bar - hopefully the pictures come out.  They definitely showed the East End how its done. We're all hanging out after when Chris announced that we're all partying at my place.  Fine by me haha.  So there was seriously just a mass of people going from the EE to Rainbow.  I rode with Oliver and we stole Tanya and halfway there Dan lept onto Oliver's and my lap while driving.  Get to my place and mass quantities of liquor and beer and malt beverages were consumed.  Trying to remember this days later is a bit hazy, it was just impromtu and crazy.  Its always great to reminisce, talk about music, and be foolishly inebriated.  We crashed around 5:30am.  Yowzers, work in the morning!

      So the girls round up and we head to Bryn Mawr to the Point.  I love the Point; it used to be my premiere venue and now I don't go there nearly enough.  I guess when you try to go to fifteen different venues a month, its hard to squeeze the favorites in.  It was a Songwriters Circle featuring Rich Price, Ryan Montbleau, Tyler Hilton, and Julia Othmer.  The four of them were on stage and rotated, performing one song each time.  Aurora, Tessa, and I had seen Rich Price before, a few months ago at The Saint with Green to Think and Graham Colton.  Ryan Montbleau blew us away.  He held his own style and emitted such talent.  Very blues influenced and though I do enjoy the "crooning singer songwriter genre", Ryan offered something a bit more refreshing.  If I wasn't so damn tired, I would write more.  Tyler Hilton was also a very good performer.  Unfortunately we didn't get to see more of the set than a few songs, but its always good to find new ones.  We also ran into Mackenzie, Ari Hest's merch girl who we all met in DC who goes to UD.  Very sweet girl, and just like us, so if you see her, say hi!   We left to grab some food at Peace a Pizza - NOT as good as ours - then get gas and coffee.  Bipin was the man of the hours since that's about how long it took him at the gas station.  Bipin!! We have places to go! We get to Kahuna to see Jealousy Curve's last song and all of the Omnisoul set.  Good show, but still didn't beat the passion that was at the East End the other week.  They are such a talented band and they keep getting stronger.  Great things to come hopefully sooner than later.  Get home around 2 am and spent a few hours doing laundry since my washer machine exploded a few hours earlier and listened to some new music.  Stupid insomnia and work in the AM.

      If you read the previous blog, I did not get to take a nap.  Instead, I cleaned Rainbow.  Why would I clean Rainbow?  OH BECAUSE I FLOODED MY APARTMENT AND THE RECORD STORE when my washer machine exploded as I was making the liquor run.  If you don't know already, I live above the record store I work at.  We were all afraid I would set the damn place on fire, not flood it out.  But all was well.  Concert review in a bit.

      "Music is necessary to my physical and mental health. I think if I didn't have it I would just explode or something." - juliana hatfield  I'm working at the record store till Chris feels like waking up and coming in.  Thennnnn, naptime and liquor run.  Followed by a quick jaunt to The Point (my favorite Philly-area venue not in the city of Philadelphia) to see Ryan Montbleau and Tyler Hilton.  Both artists we (Aurora, Marissa, Tessa, and myself) have not seen before, but want to check out.  Heading out of there early and hitting up Kahunaville to support Omnisoul and Jealousy Curve.  It will be rock and roll.

      Ahhhh...a day filled with Center Stage goodness...or not so goodness....  Center Stage days are pretty much the highlight of my week when we have productions.  I can't even explain to you what makes them so great - the car trips, the people, the crazy things that always go wrong - but it is always a memorable time.   As you probably know, I have been ranting and raving about Teitur since I heard his album.  I am also quite fond of Glen Phillips.  So I noticed on the Iota site (one of my favorite clubs - in DC) that Glen would be there, so I checked out Pollstar and Philly and low and behold he was coming to the Northstar.  So I check that site to see who was opening and dammit it was Teitur.  As soon I found that out, I told Marissa that CS HAS to do the show.  No question about it. So she set it all up and everything was going well.  Well, aside from the wrong turn we took.  There has never been a problem filming at the Northstar and it is one of my favorite places to film because the people there are always so accomodating.  We get there for load in, where Keith (the manager) proceeds to tell Marissa that everyone has to be 21.  This has never been an issue before!  And wouldn't have been an issue if Marissa and Jay weren't 19.  Which left just Epler, Ed, and me.  I had the idea of having the portable studio outside so she can direct and produce, just not be in the venue.  Then the crew informed me that we were in the ghetto and someone may die.  There was already a helicopter swooping over the area, which we assumed, was looking for a body.  So we did the only thing we could do - go to Wawa. After deliberating, it was decided that Marissa and Jay would cruise around South Street and Epler, Ed, and I would pull of at least a five person job, with 3.  The three of us have been working together on this crazy idea of mine for a while so I had confidence on our production.  I wasn't ready to step into producer mode, I was all psyched on handling a camera for the show for the first time, but of course I did since I live for this.  But the show went INCREDIBLY well.  Especially for how limited it was since it was a solo artist.   We try not to do solo artists because of the lack of busi-ness on stage, but we had to do Teitur because he is amazing.  I think I drove the boys nuts since the entire time I was singing along and saying how beautiful and great his music was.  And I don't think I ever yelled once, which is a feat for me in production, I actually had a voice left.  Afterwards...the interview. Again, I wasn't really prepared to interview anyone.  Usually I bask in the fact that I can go to these productions now and not stress, that's on Marissa's shoulders now ;-).  I hope the interview went well...asked the basics, plus stuff I was personally curious in, and other business type questions.  As Ed was fiddling with the audio, I had about 15 minutes to talk with Teiter off camera.  One of the most personable guys I have ever interviewed that I hadn't known previously.  Though the interview went smoothly, I am curious to look back on it and see how he answered a few questions.  Wondering how much of an influence Universal has on his public speaking.  Not to say that any of the answers weren't acceptable, but he was very quick to answer his thoughts on some things, such as music downloading.  It was simply just plain awesome to interview him.  Marissa pointed out that Center Stage is now internation (Teitur is from Denmark).  Rock on. Out of all of the productions I have done, it didn't rain for like, two of them.  Of course it was downpouring on the way home and still going strong as we unloaded.  I guess I should be worried if its actually sunny and nice for a show. Nothing too entertaining about this show, no one bled, no one was embarrassed, no one fell off the stairs, no one knocked over a candle on stage...but it was still an incredible experience.

      So tired.  Yesterday was yet another open to close day at the record store, though the last half was entertaining since it was Maryanne, Charise, and me.  We all got caught up in each others lives and watched the eclipse.  I think they thought I was nuts since I was bouncing around the store the entire time.  Charise had bought me coffee and that did me in.   Afterwards, Karen, Dan, Chris, and I headed up to Philly to hang out with some friends of theirs.  Always refreshing to meet new people.  You'd be proud of me, I was the responsible DD and didn't even drink, unlike other times.  Before we went to Pat's (Cheesesteaks - I know I know, I drifted away from Jim's....even though I do not consume the product, there's still years of loyalty to ol' Jim) we played in this big pile of leaves.  Great fun.  It was cold.  Very cold.  Stupid lack of internal heating system.  I swear, I have no thyroid.  I had to parallel park and I did it successfully on my second attempt in front of the whole line of people in front of Pat's.  I averted a potentially embarrassing situation by perfect navigation from my passengers :-).  It was NOT another Bohagers incident.  Ask Aurora, its her favorite story of me and driving.  We drove around the vicinity of Pat's for about a half hour as we tried to find Oliver's car.  We knew it was on a street...and he had to walk to Pat's...and he saw a red light near where he parked....he thinks.  Operative word being "thinks".  But we found it and all was good for the rest of the trek home.  Got home around 5 and watched Saving Silverman due to the prior conversations of Neil Diamond.  I had all this energy until the drive home from Karen's where I nearly fell asleep with every blink.  And of course a weary miranda is a boring miranda and I crashed around 7:15.  Stupid 10:30 am alarm clock.  But it was worth it, good times :-)

      Another great Lloyd Dobler performance and awesome time with good friends.  I have always thought that LDE is a much better live band than their studio stuff.  But then again, after hearing their new studio recordings, its safe to say that both aspects are a force to be reckoned with. So yeah, they lit up the stage with two sets of originals and some fun covers.  The crowd livened up after a bit and towards the middle of the night, everyone was on their feet.  A lot of drunk women came up to me and asked about the band.  I overheard one of the girls, after she stopped talking to me, say "i haven't seen a band this good in a while!".  Aw, that was great to hear!  My favorite was the 30 year old who kept falling over her self and gave me her business card so that she could book the band for a private show.  "Private Show".  Boom chika boom bah.  Kinda reminds me of my rock and roll porn idea.  Oh wait, why doesn't Phil tell everyone we are around about my idea ;-).  Haha, we are going to break into the business, watch out, it's gonna be hot and fly off the shelves.  Hey!  It's an untapped market! Breaks over...back on stage to start the second half off right with my new favorite LDE song -- (Kangol Black still has a special place in my hear.. ;-) Millenium Music Conference) -- "Meet Me in London."  So good.  As I was grooving to the song, I noticed this character walk in, and I did a double take because I couldn't tell if it was male or female. This person was short, chubby, long black hair, a black sweater, and a black and white skirt.  It was either a tranvestite or a really ugly woman.  I decided it didn't really matter and ignore the mystery person.  I glanced back over, and here this person is, dancing and cheering away, staring intently at Phil, with an immense hard-on.  Yes, in a skirt!!  I don;t think he noticed at first.  Everyone on stage, except for Phil noticed, it was craziness. yeah, this lasted throughout the night.  The guy kept trying to cover it up, but dude, you're in a skirt and we can so tell you are not a female now.  So gross.  If you're going to wear a skirt, at least tuck it or something so that kind of thing doesn't happen in the future.  LDE did their cover of "Friends in Low Places" and brougth Dave up on stage to sing the chorus.  Dave doesn't listen to the radio or anything popular at all (sorry, but he doesn't!) so he hummed the words and shoated out "Oasis!" at the end of every line.  Pretty damn funny.  Then Phil spilled the secrets that were previously shared at the Grape Street into the mic at the Logan House.  Granted, I doubt the audience cared about any band dramatics that are going down, but still...principles!! ;-)   After the show we hang out and talk, and this really drunk older guy felt the need to tell the band how great they were numerous times.  So Phil took me and introduced me as their manager and left!  Way to leave me with the creepies!  It's ok though since we were married in a previous life.   Craziness outside in the cold then back home to Newark with a stop at Aurora's in between. "I say...is there a party going on?!?!"   Give me Friday night apartments with red-faced tears of laughter. Jumping up and down, drinking happy ever-after Build a wall of good people and you can’t beat a young man’s pride So I’ll be one of them, I’ll be one of them this time.  ryan montbleau

      So Aurora and I have established a list of do's and don'ts when it comes to the pre and post show activities. Let's add a new one to the list:  "When one is underage and meeting up with the band to get in through the back door, do not call attention to yourself by shouting out a band members name in hearing distance from the bouncers.  Also, do not run upstairs to the back door in clear view of the bouncer man running towards you."  We learned that lesson last night.   Aurora and I headed up to the Logan House, where she did the above action, and got caught.  But at least she saved herself and wasn't lying when she said she was just saying hello to a friend.  So away we went back to Newark so I could drop her off then go back up to the Logan House.  At least we were 15 minutes away instead of 4 hours ;-).   It's ok, we all make mistakes and we learn from them!

      So I got a while roll of film back yesterday where every picture I am in, I am plastered.  Why do you guys let me do that?  It was the roll from the impromptu party upstairs and philly.  Aurora and I were looking at them last night and realize we have more pictures of each other where we are half lit and goofy then anything else.  Oh well, that makes it fun :-).  And Oliver is like Where's Waldo.  He can be found somewhere in more than half the pictures.  Haha.  Once I hook my scanner back up, I will post them online for all to enjoy.  Next investment is a digital.  Yeah, that and EZ Pass.  And a Powerbook.

      Last night Matt Nathanson played at the Scrounge.  Michelle came down to see the show and it was just like old times, except that it was free and at our alma mater rather than costing money and in Philly.   Aurora and I met her there, along with five hundred million other people.  But we are swift and went from behind the stage to standing up right in front of the door.  Go us.  The guy next to me smelled an awful lot like Parrot Bay and we were relieved that other people are as much of boozers like we are.  Though we didn't drink before this show, no time.   Matt Fish and Matt Nathanson took the stage and played an hour and a half of new and old stuff.  Matt Nathanson has been a long time favorite artists of mine, but I haven't seen him perform in about a year, so it was a much welcomed show, though I think he still used 75% of the jokes as before.  But it's ok, he is great.  Definitely one of the strongest songwriters out there, simply beautiful.  It's refreshing to see that so many people appreciate and enjoy good music.  Especially since I have been overwhelmed by the inordinate amount of twenty-somethings purchasing the new Britney Spears.

      Aurora and I have this rule that whenever we are talking with each other online there is to be no eating or drinking while typing.  We have established this rule because far too often, we make each other laugh, then we don't hear from the other, and we think that the other may have started choking on their food or drink in the midst of laughing.  Don't laugh, this has happened before.  Many food particles have eneded up on the screen because we can't eat or drink or laugh at the same time.  But today, I have eastablished that rule for myself for all online instances, not just talking to Aurora on AIM.  Here I am, calmly sitting at my computer, then my cereal falls right onto my keyboard.  Yeah, gross.  I just spent the past 5 minutes cleaning it and surprise surprise it works.

      Ahhh...yet another Center Stage taping and another good night.  Tonight we were a bit short on people, but it all turned out ok since we actually weren't allowed to bring our whole setup.   And of course, it DOWNPOURED and we were under a Tornado Watch for most of the evening.  It wouldn't be a CS taping if there wasn't the rain to try break us down.  We hit a monsoon when we taped Jonasay in June, avoided tornadoes tonight, Blizzard of 04 - BRING IT ON. What is usually a 45 minute trip took double that time, but we were able to set up and get everything underway just on time.  Again, it wouldn't be a CS taping if we didn't have to run somewhere and get something, whether it be blank tapes in the ghetto, coffee at Wawa, or RCA to XLR cables at the local music supply store.   Angie put on a great set and I can't wait to see how the footage turned out.  Unfortunately we were limited to only two cameras, but hey, we're old pros!   The highlight of the evening had to be Mullet Man.  This guy had an intense mullet.  He was hardcore.  So naturally, Marissa and I followed him with our camera.  Then!!!  The best idea ever for a commercial! Oh just you wait....Center Stage brings new meaning to the mullet catch phrase, "business in the front, party in the back".

      Here is the LDE point of view of the night...   November 18th, 2003: Grape Street Pub, Philadelphia, PA.  So, Donnie and Rod and I had to get from New Canaan, Connecticut to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 2 hours during the later part of rush hour. Somehow, I eluded our friends from the law enforcement agencies and made to the Grape Street Pub only five minutes late. Donnie says says that the only reason we left the recording studio was to pick up a few Philly Cheesesteaks.  We got to the Grape as fast as we could and set up the stage. By the time we began our set, we only had enough time to perform about 5 songs. So, I didn't even bother setting up my acoustic guitar and we started our set as soon as we were set up on stage. No soundcheck. We played KANGOL BLACK PARTY, NO VOY A LLORAR, CONTROL, STRANGER, DOIN THE BUTT and BETTER THAN YOU EVER DREAMED WAS POSSIBLE.  After the show, we hung out with three of my heros, who are DAVE PITTENGER, MIRANDA HAFFORD and SAMMIE FROM Y-100. Dave Pittenger has a great band in Philly called THE DAVE PITTENGER BAND (www.thedpband.com). Donnie wanted to eat a really good Philly Cheesesteak so Dave drove me, Miranda, Donnie and Doug somewhere deep into the back ghettos of South Philly to a tremendous cheesesteak place. We bought the food, ate and I have had the shits all day. Thanks alot Dave! I thought the only part of my waste that was supposed to be runny was supposed to come out of the apparatus on the front of me.  Then, we return from the high integestion to Manyuck (where Grape Street is) and we find that Miranda's car has been locked inside the garage she parked in! No luck. Rusty said that he would drive her home. THEN, on the way home, Rod runs out of gas (...I guess he could have borrowed some of mine from the cheesesteak). He ended up having to call the police to help him (I never thought I'd see the day). I wonder what the cops thought when they smelled the van's "air freshener" (heh heh)...  ...OH, somebody end our misery, please!  -PHIL from The Road

      I needed last night after my awful day on Monday. Got up to Grape Street and was walking to the venue when I heard LDE playing from someone's car.  Very odd because it was so loud and I couldn't find where it was coming from and must have twirled around the cobblestone a few times trying to detect which car was causing the ruckus.  Couldn't find it.  Met up with Dave and Rusty and hung out while we waited for the other half of the band to get there.  Supposed to play at 9, it was 9:10, so we play the load-in game while waiting for Phil.  When he arrived, he nearly died when he saw Dave and me since he had no idea we were coming.  Surprises are always good.  We wanted to go up to the Grape to show the guys support, especially since they haven't been in Philly in a while, and especially because they are such good people.  They played a short set, but enough to get people off their feet and to get some awesome pictures.  Phil, Dave, and I hung out, caught up, and shared secrets in the back alley.  We were all in usually high spirits and it was great to share that with such good company.  It was time to hunt for food, so we grab Doug and traversed Main Street while we found every place that had food closed.  So Phil and I walked arm and arm entertaining the others with our concept of rock n' roll porn instead of dinner.  We get back to the Grape where Javi meeted us with a bag of warm Pabst.  We all took three sips then chucked them into the alley of the Grape in hopes of hitting something resembling a trash can but was more likely a wall.  We get Donnie and decide to head into the city in the Pittenger van to show the guys a real Philly Cheesesteak.  As Dave circled South Philly, which we call South Philly and not da ghetto, and showed us the "South Philly Slide", we finally found Genos.  We all cram into a table for good eats (note, I had cheese fries, not cheesesteaks...nothing with a smile).  Afterwards, Donnie had to pee, so we find a 7-11 where Phil, Dave, and I make some trouble and take more pictures.  Slurpees and hot chocolate are so good on so many levels.  We get back to the Grape and Dave is driving me to my car first where we find out that OH NO THE GARAGE WHERE MY CAR WAS KEPT IS CLOSED!!  It was 1 am!! Who closes a garage at midnight when bars around there stay open till 2?!?!  Argh.  So Phil calls the garage number for me to no avail.  Well, Phil was going north to Connecticut, the Godinez brothers were heading to DC in the van, and Rusty had his car.  So Rusty and Doug said they would drop me off in Newark en route to DC.  So sweet.  So we're bumping to some go-go, and just got onto 495 when Phil calls me and tells me the LDE van broken down somewhere in PA.  Through multiple phone calls, we realize the van ran out of gas.  Sigh, not a good day for travelling!  So I get home around 2:30 and woke up at 5:50 so I could go grab my car in Manyunk this morning.  Good thing my mom had off the past few days.  Sigh.   And today was spent getting things accomplished, so no sleep was to be had.  Tonight we're filming Angie Aparo.  We rock. Oh and watch the F out, great things are in store for LDE.  GREAT THINGS.

      So I usually only have time for one decent meal a day, which is usually breakfast if I am up in time since I usually start my mornings at home rather than at work or on the road.  Oat meal has been posing a problem to me lately.  It keeps exploding in my microwave.  I even put a paper towl over it to catch the explosion, but it still doesn't help.  Today I did four, one minute intervals and dammit during the last minute, there was a mess.  Argh.  Its still ok, but how do I not get soy milk all over my microwave!?

      Saturday night was spent with more musical goodness and good times with great friends.  Our motto has always been work hard...play hard.  Seriously now, I think we all attract one another due to our penchant for emmersing ourselves into everything we do...music, tv, drinking, radio, work, what have you. Off to East End for the evening to see Omnisoul - yes, again, and Ike perform.  We like Ike.  A lot.   Premium malt beverages were had and crazy dancing and singing ensued.  We enjoy making John laugh at his "delaware crew" while onstage.  Between sets we all chatted in the back, then made our way back near the front for Omnisoul.  Oliver, Dan, Chris, and I have seen them three times in four days, merely by convenience ;-).  If they keep it up, they may break the PMB 4 show, 5 day record.  And we can't be having that.   Great Omnisoul show, as usual.  And Dan got his Paranoid Android.  Complete with the Shaka of Love.  After the show, it was off to Derek's.  Aurora, Jen, Hillary, and I got into the car and decided the next best place to go was Wawa.  Ok, so again, I am sure you all know my obsessed love for Wawa, and one of the most joyous things inside the Wawa is the "incident free" sign educating the costumers on just how safe Wawa is.  Well we pull up and I see an ambulance.  APPARENTLY I freaked out wondering if there was an incident.  APPARENTLY I was really excited about that.  I don't think I did anything of the sort and they are just exaggerating.  I am always calm and collected.  Always.   So then we go to Derek's for more drinking and talking when we figured that the best thing to do at that moment was to walk across the street to the diner.  Nice.  Until early Sunday morning, I have never seen anyone drink it up at a diner.  Chris conveniently replaced his water with vodka at the table in a valiant effort in hardcore drinking.  Hey, the booze travels with us wherever we go.  Mr. Flask does not like to be left home alone.   When all was done and well, it was 5 am when I went to bed.  And again, I had to wake up super early to open up the record store.  The word of the day was "hardcore".  It was uttered about 80 times from five different people.  Yeah, we're all hardcore. 5 am seems to be the magic number.

      Friday was same old, same old.  Record store, radio station, show of some sort.   The radio show went ok, for the most part.  Somehow I seem to lose my voice on Fridays where I have to broadcast for two hours, rather than any of the other 6 days.  It was comforting to hear all of the phone calls to the station wishing that I felt better.  Thank you. Afterwards, Chris, Dan, and I headed to the Grape Street to see Omnisoul before going to South Street.  Derek and I were talking about, I think, at my place the other night...or was it somewhere else...I can't recall...all days lately seem to blur together, how much his band has evolved since I first started hearing their music years ago.  Whoa, we are definitely old. I just said the word "years".  Yikes!  But they put on a good show and thankfully the room filled up pretty nicely for them during their set.   We, the "we" has now grown to Chris, Dan, Oliver, Matt, Jess, and I, left the Grape and followed the river down to South Street for some food and more music.  Green to Think was playing at the Pontiac and since its been MONTHS since I have seen a full-on GTT show, I had to be there.  It was good to see the guys and the GTT girls again, such good people.  They're all going to make living in NYC even better.  GTT played the whole Sundays EP, plus "We Are Stars", "She Won't Let Me Be", "1, 2, 3...", and "Nineteen".  And when I say "the whole Sundays EP", I mean it...including Allison Rose.  Yeah acoustic geetah.   I almost hit a deer coming home from Chris's.  It had antlers!! :::proceed to wave hands above head signifying actual antlers:::  Everyone would be glad to know I stopped and waited for him to cross the street, as opposed to actually hitting it like other furry creatures that cross my path.  I think it was around 4:30 am when I went to bed this time, yay for going to bed early.  Or earlier than 5.  Stupid 10 am opening the store crap.

      Six hundred miles and sixteen hours later, Aurora and I headed down to Norfolk to see a show and back.  What else is new :-) We made it out of Newark around 1 pm after our customary Wawa stop for caffeine.  Cds in the car and directions in hand, we were ready to go.  I thought Aurora had read the directions that I had written down and I said that we are good until Salisbury then we have to take some new roads and will need her help.  So to me, the Bay Bridge is the huge ass bridge and tunnel across the Chesapeake, and to her, the Bay Bridge is another bridge that goes over the bay.  SO she is taking me through these backroads and I figure its ok since she nows quick routes near her house.  So we're talking, singing, having a good and we go over this bridge and into... ANAPOLIS!   And me and my geography skills know that this isn't right, and conveniently we see a sign for a visitor center.  We park across from the Ram's Head and go in and get a map - I am redoing my website and I will scan what we wrote on the map and post it up.  We met the nicest visitor center guides, chatted, then left.  We were only 125 miles off route of a 230 mile trip.  Aurora felt bad, but I told her it was all apart of the adventure and we got the scenic route.  So we head off onto Route 50 to meet up with 13 and it was the worst god forsaken highway ever.  Too many stupid drivers, no cool places to stop, and just a damn tease in our destination to Norfolk.  An hour after we left Anapolis, I realized that Mr. Patty McGee, Fecchino, and our ever favorite Ghegan were all playing at the Ram's Head that night.  Damn us for not stopping in and saying hi!   In Salisbury get onto 13 and desperately needed more caffeine and bathroom and sustenance.  Royal Farms is now the worst place to stop on a trip ever.  Usually the RF is the place to go after Fletcher's and any time I am hanging out with Jonasay in Maryland, but heeeelllll no, not anymore!  Number one, no bathroom, number two...worst coffee in the world, and Aurora and I have had pretty bad road coffee.  So I am grumbling about the lack of Wawa's as I cut across three lans of traffic and make a u-turn while Aurora is trying to balance our goods.  Dammit, we pass a Wawa 2 minutes later.  As well as a sign saying "Norfolk - 125 miles"  Argh!! So in our usual fashion, I decide that speeding is the best way to get from point A to point B.  As I am pushing the accelerator, we pass an "Oasis Car Wash."  Perfect!!  The LDE guys make fun of Aurora and I and our fondness for the GCB groove and they call them NOasis (and pretty much every other person who has played with them - whch pretty much includes all of our friends - agree), so we thought it was fitting and fate that we pass an Oasis.  Then we pass a sign saying "Slow Down Pilgrim!"  Best sign ever.  And of course, they were right, my heart fluttered about 20 times everytime I passed a cop and was forced to go slightly above the speed limit.  That was really going to put a hamper on our getting there faster.  So we need food and gas and so we stopped for rejuvenation as quickly as possible.  We stop at a the slowest Wendy's around, where I had an opportunity to check out my fatigue in a mirror.  I then show Aurora the vein in my eye that becomes visible when I am stressed or tired or stessed AND tired.  And the vein was big.  I told her that should not happen, and it did.  Dinner consisted of a Frosty and fries because that is the easiest thing to eat and drive.  We get to the bridge and I nearly die of anxiety.  I despise bridges, especially those that are halfway submerged and like 17 miles long.  But soon after the bridge was Norfolk.  About damn time! It looked like a cute city, but I wouldn't know because I was zipping around the streets.  Usually when we take trips, I am the one who has to stop eighty times due to my insufficient bladder, but not this time.  As we were tuning onto Chruch Street, Aurora informs me that she soon may not be able to have Graham's children.  It was so clamly said, so I inquire why the change. She tells me because her bladder is slowly crushing her uterus.  That was so damn funny I nearly swerved off the road!  It was also in hour eight of our destination, so I think we were just delerius.  We thought it was pretty damn sad that we had been in the car for more hours then we have slept lately.  We drive past the venue and nearly died when we saw the live wrapped around the venue.  Sigh.  We park - only 4 bucks - we rule - and walk over to will call.   The Norva is an awesome venue. A slightly smaller Electric Factory with the feel of a House of Blues.  We make our way to the side of the stage in the midst of a sold out show.  Tristan Prettyman was the opener was good, though we weren't paying much attention to her.  She had good stage presence and her songs were good, but the people around us were so chatty that it detracted from the show because we were too busy being annoyed by the irritating girls next to us.  Graham Colton took the stage next with an electrifying performance.  Such great energy and Turtle has a new guitar.  Every time we see them, they keep evolving and becoming stronger in their use of talent and stage show.  So great and the crowd was really receptive.  And of course Aurora and I were screaming out the lyrics and just acting like the happy, tired, girls we were who were "waking up".  I texted the setlist to myself so we would have it - All the World Tonight, Jessica, How Low, Cut, Cigarette, Champagne Supernova -> Killing Me, and Don't Give Up On Me.  Afterwards we went back to the merch table to say hi where Turtle proceeded to tell Aurora he remembered her and then he stole my scarf.  So we chatted about the new album and the recording and the upcoming tour and whatnot then left to see Jason Mraz.  The show wasn't what I expected, but still stellar.  He started off very mellow, then kicked it up a notch to an explosive encore.  We spet half the evening trying to find a decent place to stand.  Again, a complaint about the audience was its chattiness and constant movement.  Seriously now, every two seconds people were coming or going, watch the damn show people! It was great to see Jason live but the best performance was still by GCB.  We also missed a few Mraz songs because we were outside while Aurora smoked.  So we decided to use that time wisely by calling Phil since we all have a long running GCB joke between us all.  Aurora claimed that whenever she left a message on his vmail, it cuts her off.  I didn't beleive her, so we call him, and everytime she takes the phone to say hi, his phone hates her and hangs up.  Three times.   Show ends at 12:30 and we hit the road back to DE.  All we want is a damn Wawa for again, gas, coffee, food, and bathroom.  We knew one was 125 miles away in Salisbury, but we were hoping to find one closer.  No luck.  My eyes started burning around the 60th mile.  Finally we stopped at the Wawa where we met the nicest Wawa people who inquired about our travels and we shared our love for Wawa with them and how it is a safehaven for us.  They don;t understand how happy we were to be there.  So after we left Salisbury, I was wide again and ready to go.  Soon after we were at Aurora's place, then I headed back to Newark and rolled in around 5 am.   CDs listened to in the car: Ryan Montbleau - Begin, Tyler Hilton - EP, Jason Mraz - Mix CD, Pat McGee - Tin Angel solo show, STN Mix, Howie Day - Stop All the World Now, Green to Think - Sundays EP, Matt Nathanson - Beneath these Fireworks

      Whenever I go away, I have a tendency to make sure my living space is clean, so when I come back all tired and wanting familiarity, I will have it all nice and organized.  So since these next three days will more than likely not be spent much here, I cleaned up today.  And I forgot to do my laundry until 1am.    When you do your laundry at 1 am make sure you don't wash your favorite burgandy sweater with everything else, because you will find burgandy sweater balls on your socks, underwear, and favorite pants that are pink.   Not on all of your favorite pants, just the pink ones.  And usually I will wash all of those things seperately so that they don't fight in the washer, but I only had a few things that needed to be clean.

      Chris bought me a kit kat today.  It was the highlight of my work evening. We had a Rainbow meeting last night at Grottos, but it pretty much just turned into Charise, Max, Maryann, Raf, and I drinking and talking about people.  And of course, I called Chris to see why he wasn't there and asked if he was sitting in his boxers, drinking a beer, and watching a DVD because Raf assumed he was.  All he said was "tell them all I say 'my bad'".  Haha, only Chris... We're such a cool little family that it rocks that we are all working together in this whole record store endeavor.  We've all become such good friends and our personalities mesh so well that Rainbow has really established an identity.  Crazy times.

      If you don't know already, I am attracted to abductions.  Of course the most memorable was the Elizabeth Smart case and I followed that story from Day One all the way up to that CBS special ;-).  Stumbled across this in the news this afternoon:  GRAND FORKS, North Dakota (AP) -- Hundreds of volunteers lined up Tuesday to join the search for a University of North Dakota student who has been missing since Saturday. Police believe she may have been abducted.   Dru Sjodin, a 22-year-old senior in graphic arts from Pequot Lakes, Minnesota, was last seen late Saturday afternoon, as she was leaving the Columbia Mall in Grand Forks where she worked.   Her mother, Linda Walker, said her daughter was talking to her boyfriend on her cell phone about 5 p.m. Saturday when her boyfriend heard her say, "Oh, my God." Walker said the phone then went dead.   On Tuesday morning, the volunteers were given identification badges and assigned to teams, then bused to an area east of the city to search for Sjodin.   "I was up all night, because I've just been itching to get out and do this," said Jerrod Arneson, one of the searchers. "You never think something like this would happen here, and when it does, you want to do something."   The search was concentrated on an area around Fisher, Minnesota, east of Grand Forks, where police had traced a call from Sjodin's cell phone.   Police said Sjodin's red car, a two-door Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, was found in a Columbia Mall parking lot. Lt. Dennis Eggebraaten said a package that Sjodin apparently bought at the mall was inside the car.   "There was no sign of a struggle that we could determine," he said.   Police were investigating calls to Sjodin at the Victoria's Secret store where she worked. They said she had received at least one call from a man she did not know, who asked for her by name.   Jean Ann Bienek, the store's manager, declined to comment, citing store policy.   Authorities said Sjodin's roommate notified police at about 9:30 p.m. Saturday, after Sjodin failed to show up for work at her second job in a bar.   Her family is offering a $20,000 reward.

      I am so stuffed from early Thanksgiving dinner!! The past few years have always found us having a big Thanksgiving dinner at someone's house, and this year, Andy fell victim to hosting the festivities.  I went to my first group Thanksgiving four years ago with Michelle at Tim's place over at 365 and its been tradition since.  The Holiday dinner the girls hosted at 5208 two years ago was insanity.  Always great to have homecooked food, good wine, and friends all gather together.   I worked in the morning and thankfully Charise covered the rest of my shift so I could pick up Karen then head to Andy's.  We watched the Eagles game and devoured Nina's dip.  There is a reason that they don't let this girl come unless she brings her Mexican concoction with her! ;-)  We ate a huge dinner downstairs while watching this Extreme Challenge game on Spike TV.  Oh my gosh, the best tv show EVER.  No where else but on Spike can you find crazy physical challenges being dubbed over in snarky and crude english.  And where else do you have to carry a golden orb (a painted voleyball) while getting slammed in the face with a ball.  Or a guy in a peanut suit leaping over a muddy pond to get from plank to plank.  So damn funny.  Then the end of Rush Hour, followed by the Simpsons.  Quality Sunday TV programming to coincide with the thanksgiving dinner.    Karen and I were quite impressed with Andy's new place, though Tim claims that it wasn't Andy's control of the decorating.  Crazy how in a few years we go from a place that had a sausage nailed to the wall to now a house with a sailboat on the coffee table and a spice rack.  Its ok though, the empty Miller Lite case remains the same.  :-)  Getting older doesn't necessarily mean growing up.

      Yeah!  Blue Hen Foot ball takes the conference!!  I was listening in to the game via WVUD and just love our commentators, they're hilarious.  You should listen, too ;-) But we won and now it's time to take the division.  Villanova wasn't quite happy.  We have a huge rivalry with 'Nova which always leads to chaos in the end.  Their cheerleaders were easy targets the last time I saw the two face off, but UD never goes for blood!   Auto plows into crowd after UD win 4 hurt outside Villanova Stadium   By DOUG LESMERISES Staff reporter 11/23/2003  VILLANOVA, Pa. -- Four people were injured after the University of Delaware football game Saturday night when a car drove through a crowd of about 100 football players, family and friends outside the locker room at Villanova Stadium, police said.   Villanova Athletic Director Vince Nicastro said his team's chaplain, the Rev. Bernard Lazor, was behind the wheel of the green Ford Taurus after it stopped at the end of a 25-foot wide driveway on the south side of the stadium where the crowd had gathered. However, Radnor Township police did not identify the driver and no arrests were made late Saturday.   Several witnesses said people "went down like dominoes" while the driver, traveling about 30 mph, honked the horn but never stopped.   One end of the driveway opens into a lot where the Delaware team buses were parked during the game. The Taurus was traveling in the opposite direction, which comes to a dead end at stairs and a wheelchair ramp. Two other cars were parked along the driveway after the game.   "We weren't there to get hit," said Debbie Edwards of Wallingford, Pa., the mother of Delaware center Chris Edwards, who was not hurt. "We were there to greet the players coming out. Everyone was talking and no one was paying attention and, all of a sudden, this car just headed down there. People were under the tires, on top of the hood. I would have been under the tire if my friend hadn't pushed me out of the way."   Some fans stood by in tears while at least two injured people were taken away by ambulances and Delaware's football equipment was being loaded into a truck several feet away. Student trainer Jen Jones, 22 and a senior at UD, said the crowd was mostly Delaware fans.   "After all of our games, the fans come by to see us and congratulate the players and say hi to the team," Jones said. "It all happened very fast. He just plowed through. There was no brakelights - nothing. You didn't even hear the horn until it was too late."   Brian Honeycutt, 37, of Newark, said he was nearly hit. He said he then ran alongside the car after it went through the crowd, yelling at the driver to stop. He said he saw the driver staring straight ahead with his hands on top of the steering wheel.   Many of the Delaware players were either speaking in a postgame news conference or still getting dressed in the locker room as the car came through. Quarterback Andy Hall said he heard someone run into the locker room yelling, "Get a doctor out here."   "I don't know what's going on, but people just got run over," Hall said. "It was a lot of our families. The football game is irrelevant right now. It's totally irrelevant."   Delaware won the game 20-17 to win the Atlantic 10 Conference championship.   University of Delaware administrators could not be reached for comment.   According to Villanova's football media guide, Lazor has been a priest for 50 years and is an assistant professor of religious studies at the university.

      I was going to spend my Saturday night finishing my NYU essay, scanning pictures, watching a movie, and catching up on sleep.  Yeah, that didn't happen. I was already in my pajamas and writing diligently away on my computer when I heard from Brittany saying that Whitney was visiting us from DC.  Change of plans! The last time I saw Whitney was when we all sat together at graduation.  So odd where time takes us and how quickly time goes by.  Seems like just yesterday where we were all at the TV station rolling over in laughter at the mockery that was the Daily Rewind.  So cool though that we can all hang out and have a good time as if we were still around.   Let's see where everyoneis now...  Everyone being our core tv posse, because since we devulged our life into that damn endeavor, we ended up being such good friends, which is odd because we have all always said that if it wasn't for the hell that was STN we all probably wouldn't have gotten to know each other.  Nothing brings people closer than editing for 10 hours straight at 4 am, cursing the consistent broken equipment, and realizing that we were the only ones taking ourselves seriously - oh wait, we didn't do that. Well, I am here still at Rainbow and putting off anymore hardcore job search since I am hopefully going to grad school in the fall.  Karen is still searching and working at Cafe Gelato in the meantime.  Whitney is at American in the film program getting her masters.  Anne is heading off to Australia for a bit to travel and find a random job there.  Fisher is living at home in Silver Spring, unfortunately there is no Grottos there, so no idea where he is working, but its not anything related to our degree or television.  And of course, Jen, Brittany, and Aurora are still at UD.  Ok, that is the end of my nostalgia, let the good times begin...! So Brittany, Jen, and I head to Kate's to meet up with Whitney and Liz for a night of drinking and dancing - which beats writing an essay any day!  Premium malt beverages were consumed as well as finishing off Whitneys beer as we passed it back and forth.  Whitney and I take pride in the fact that since we don't go to U of D anymore we can act like fools with our dancing since we don't see these people on a continuous basis like Jen and Brittany.  So we bust out the 80's groove.  Ew!!  And the guys there are like hawks!  They don't dance and they just stare at their prey waiting for the perfect time to launch.  Don't be creepy!!  It's ok though since we are all pretty strong and don't allow ourselves to be victims of the creepiness.  Do not break our girl circle because we will laugh at you and make fun of you and think of you as a lesser man. We left shortly after midnight then headed to 123 to meet up with Andy and the frisbee party.  They had an unusual amount of large stuffed and blow up animals in their living room.  Mass quantities of pink stuff was consumed and the incredible hulk gloves were busted out.  Liz then proceed to make sweet love to the blow up monkey.  Valente made an appearance, why do we call him Valente instead of Mike, how did that begin!?  We were all piled onto the couch analyzing certain behaviors and debating the name of Whitney and Valente's love child.   Ha!  Intercourse Hellllllloooooo!!!!!  So when we got to the party, Mike Sansom was playing his guitar with a mass sing-a-long.  We found it odd that we knew the words until Andy reminded us of the frisbee band, Intercourse Hello.  As soon as we heard that, we (Whitney, Jen, and I) shouted out how you say the name.  Can you beleive that was three years ago?!  Party Warehouse was definitely a highlight of STN in retrospect.   Last night was great and I wish I had more of the entertaining details since we were pretty much laughing our asses off the entire night.

      Every time Aurora and I travel somewhere that is a bit extreme, we get sick.  We go to Norfolk and the girl now has a bronchial infection.  Though I should be avoiding her like the plague since I can't afford to get sick, I don't.  And we go to Wawa late at night, watch late night tv, and laugh at things that shouldn't be funny.  And we see the snow fall down at 1:30 in the morning against the massively huge traffic light and its all alright.

      Yeeha, I bought a laptop.   During the Thanksgiving festivities, I was asked what I wanted for Christmas.  I really don't have a need for anything right now.  Some things would be nice to have, but I don't  need  anything.  I have everything that I could possibly need right now, I have a car in great shape, I have an apartment, I have two horses who never let me down, I'm healthy, have great friends, and the melody keeps me going.  Nothing is richer than that.  My mother has known that I have been wanting a laptop for a bit, just because I am always on the go and mine has not been upgraded in the past two years.  She planned to get me a Vaio but I would much rather have something cheaper and more financial help with grad school - which is killer.   So she peruased the sales papers for Black Friday and settled on giving Best Buy (I know I know I know, don't even think it...I am shopping AT THE MAN) a visit at 5:15 am.  She picks me up at 5 and we head to Wawa for some java.  Odd that this is the time that I usually go to bed, and not wake up.  These two guys are next to us and kept staring at me, in which I responded by staring at his friend who must have been a complete five foot three and at 5 am, this was hilarious.  So we deemed him Napoleon.  We get to Best Buy and the line was insane, but we weren't too far behind.  Strangely, Napoleon and his friend were a few people ahead of us.  Got closer to the front of the line and Dan was quite chipper - or not - handing out vouchers.  Ugh, he had to work ten hours at the largest retailer on Black Friday - carpe diem!  It's ok though, he showed us a shortcut and we were surrounded by some interesting customers.  We all had a good time chatting in line and observing a few arguments. Afterwards I headed to the radio station where I had a decent show.  After I signed off I got a call from a person in Chicago who told me how much he enjoyed my show and inquired about a few artists.  Crazy, I was able to run down a synopsis and some recent tour dates on some off them - take that, Clear Channel.  I had my usual callers, but that one stuck out the most.  It always feels good when someone proactively tells you how much they appreciate what you do, more often than not, in the media, critcs vocalize complaints rather than compliments. Friday night found me at the record store working with Max and Jen.  Jen and I used to work every Friday night together for the past three years until she moved to Towson to finish up school.  Everything is well with Jen...and she got engaged!  We all knew it was going to happen, and it did.  So yay for Jen.  I'm glad she is back for the holiday season, makes Rainbow seem a bit more complete.

      "Oh, the seasons change so quickly these days And while the rest in their new coats and new hats shiver in their beds You stand outside and watch the clouds go by in the same clothes that I met you in" matt nathanson  Above is one of my favorite Matt Nathanson lyrics.  Below, you will find a link to last years Thanksgiving blog.  I pretty much feel the same way this year, and can't believe that twelve months have already passed.  I am surrounded by the most wonderful people and the past year has been absolute insanity and I am so thankful to have each day be so exciting.  The past two months have been exceptional in whirlwind activity.  Though I am not very materialistic, I find enjoyment in the people I am around and the experiences we encounter rather than something tangible, and lately I have been more grateful for the opportunities that I have been given.  Crazy nights of crashing at 5 or just not sleeping at all just so I don't miss a thing.  And with the people I am around and what we do, it's not worth passing by.  http://galileo358.blogspot.com/2002_11_24_galileo358_archive.html

      Yestrday was one of the more stressful days at the record store.  We're going through some changes, some abrupt changes, and though change is sometimes good, sometimes you're unprepared for it.  More on that later, just wallow in my vagueness.  Let me just say that I think all sanity in Rainbow was lost around 4, right around the time that the singing and dancing in the aisles ensued.   And so well, after, what do I do best, I went to the bar.  Good times and strange conversations.   Well, Tanya and I had normal conversations and I tried to frighten Lex even more than I did on Saturday night.  But odd conversations were had on the other side of the table.  There is no other side of the table.  But I am sure you can read more about that and other antics at the  urlLink Marlon Spike Message Board , where you can cause a ruckus.  And as I just checked the link, Chris already started the thread.  Oh my.

      A few of my favorite things include hats, bags, and flip flops.    Went shopping down Main Street today shopping with Tanya looking for some chintzy jewelry for a theme party this weekend, but instead I found a bag that will perfectly complement my camera.    And if this Sunday doesn't find me watching a football game of sorts, I will be shopping some more in Philly.  I need a new skirt.  NEED.

      Ok, so there is this guy in Newark that has acquired a penchant for me and now I need an escort up to my apartment every night I work.  Last Monday this guy came into the store and followed me around and just said some random not cool things to me.  He came in a few times and just wouldn't leave me alone.  Raf and he started yelling at each other and Raf kicked him out etc etc.  Then the guy proceed to just stare at me from the window.  So Jim let me go early and walked me upstairs.   On Saturday he came in again, but didn't stay.  Then last night Melissa came in to visit and the guy was yelling at me through the window.  I grabbed Chris and showed him the guy...just in case.    He follows me throughout the store and is just really creepy.  He says he wants to know everything about me, and then will run out.  He'll stare at me and not move at all for minutes.  He reaches over the counter and wants to know my name.  Why in hell does he chose me?    One distinctive feature he has are these piercing blue eyes.  So blue that they are almost clear.  Dark short hair.  About 5'10''.  Black jacket and either carrying a book bag, or a guitar, or both.  I don't feel threatened, I just feel that he is being invasive.  But again, why me...?

      Ok, that shouldn't be true, but it really does.  I was talking about it with Aurora and Charise, and honestly, alcohol in my life makes my outlook better.  Nothing better than not feeling or having control.  Well, there are some things better, but this is the most accessible.  Charise said it best when she said that its pretty sad that she is excited when she can get off of work to drink.  Oh my.  Drink up, drink up while we are still young. So Saturday.  Oh how I needed Saturday.  I warned Rainbow Chris that since I don't have anything to do on Sunday, Saturday better watch out because I was going to hit it hard... Charise, Max, and I headed out to Raf's party.  He was having a gathering and playing some tunes with his band.  Charise and I discovered some wine and it was pretty much done for as soon as we found it.  After that ran out, the keg was hit as Nate and I hooted and hollered at Raf as he played guitar to the coffee table.  So we decided to leave and go to Deer Park.  Nate wouldn't let me carry my beer in his car so he took it from me and hid it.  I realized I didn't have my bag, so I went inside to get it, where I discovered my beer in the snow.  I attempted to make a beer slushie, while slipping and sliding down the driveway.  I should not do two things when I drink...use my cell phone, and use my computer.... At work earlier, Tanya brought me brownies and we were talking about that night's festivities, so it was decided that Saturday night would find us at the DP.  So I call her to make sure she is there, then dial some more numbers.  I had gotten many a drunken phone calls the night before - cough cough from ohio at 3 am cough cough - so I call Phil back and have no idea what kind of message I left.  Sorry.  Then I call Aurora.  Yeah. At the Deer Park, met up with everyone who I didn't expect to be there, but Tanya brought the whole posse - Chris, Dan, Elise, Oliver, McDerm, Lex, Evan, etc etc.  Stumbled around the DP and realized how cool it is that everyone from all walks convene at the old watering hole.  Ran into some Sallies kids, WVUD people, and riding team people.  Very cool.  Left there and off to Olivers.... Don't know how I ended up in Oliver's car.  I think Chris wanted me to drive his beamer.  Um, that pretty much wasn't the safest option.  So Lex drove and the entire way I chattered and blabbered and pretty much told the two of them stuff I wouldn't say if I wasn't inebriated.  I think they may think I am crazy.  Ah, whatever, I made them laugh.  I think I am placed here on this earth for one reason and one reason only - my life is amusing and allows others to laugh at my follies at my expense.   We get to Oliver's and hang out and be merry.  Snow is good to fall in because it cushions.  Aurora had called and I passed the phone around and I think Dan told her to come, so she did.  And more merryment was had.  Oliver, McDerm, and I tried to play airplane.  Operative word is try.  And yes, where they lie on their backs and I try to fly.   Around 4:30 Aurora and I left for home and we had a sleep over.  We watched TV and talked to Phil and he hung up on us and we went to bed only to awake to freaking cars honking all morning.  Oh wait, it was afternoon.  We woke up around 3 I think.  Oh my. But I needed to have one day of fun where I had nothing responsible to do the next day.

      "dishes in the sink clothes spread on the floor bills left unpaid phone calls ignored..." VAL EMMICH  Whoa.  I pulled out my Val CD out last night and have been listening to it all day again today.  I almost forgot how good it was.  It's like finding buried treasure.  The above quote pretty much explains my life at this very point in time.  Verbatim, and I laughed.  He is playing at THE SAINT the day after Christmas.....yeah?

      I swear, I am amazed at the blatant lack of intelligence that is depicted in public.  Chris thinks its because we spend most of our days working retail - but its really sad to see how many people just don't get it.  Just a few things I have encountered in the past few days:  1) This woman saw a commercial on tv saying that an AFI cd was available in all stores now.  So I tell her we carry it, its just sold out at the time and we'll be getting more in.  She then says "no, but the tv said it was available now in all stores, so I want to pick it up".  Again, I tell her we are sold out.  "BUT THE TV SAYS ITS AVAILABLE IN ALL STORES!" The conversation lasted for a few more minutes as I tried to explain to the woman what the commercial meant and that product does sell, and occassionally, does sell out.  Think woman THINK!  2) Sure, why not, let your kid roll around in our aisles while there are holiday shoppers and things to be done in the store.  Oh yeah, she should scream loudly too because its fun.  3)  When did we learn our alphabet?  Maybe you should walk your ass over to the big letter dividers and find your CD your own damn self instead of making me do it.  What's even better is when someone waits while you ring up people and take phone calls and what not for fifteen minutes instead of taking the thirty seconds to walk over and get their music.  4) We close at 9.  Don't wander around after 9 after I turn off the music, tell you multiple times that we are closing, and turn off most of the lights and not buy anything.    5) Don't ask me to pick out music for your kid.  Because if you're not nice to me, I will pick out something that will make you look like a chump and make you realize that you should spend more time with your kids and his interests.  See, I am looking out for you.  6) Don't call me up wanting to know if we have a cd that you don't know the name of or who the artist is.  Because I am supposed to know that song...thats sung by that guy...  I'm sure you have access to the internet, use it.  7) Don't look at me weird because I am eating dinner at the counter.  I probably have been in the store working for six hours already and more than likely its my first meal of the day, so if I do it standing and dealing with your crap at the same time, so be it.  8) Don't be a pain in my ass.  Some people like to come in every freaking day.  And be annoying every freaking day.  9) Its the flu and cold season - don't be an ass and cough all over EVERYTHING without covering your mouth.  10) If you don't like my music of choice that is playing in the store at the moment, either ignore it or get out.

      Saddam Hussein was caught this weekend, hiding like a coward in a spider hole. To me, it is one of those events that I will always remember what I was doing when I found out.  A headache woke me up before my alarm and I actually saw it on Sean's away message, turned it on CNN, and couldn't beleive it.  Not that I didn't have faith in the US troops, but its been an immense manhunt.  But the US came out victorious.  I think I hold this war in a different regard than most people around me.  First off, I am not that vocal about it since not many people around me are.  I grew up in a military family and have experienced war first hand.  Both of my parents were active in the Air Force, my mom most recently being commended and honored with a memorial in DC for involvement during wartime, and my father being active during the Gulf.  I also think I am pretty informed on what has been going on, having studied it for the whole ordeal in my poli sci classes, but also since I am a news junkie.   People I know have died in this war.  Not one of us knows what it is like to have our freedom threatened, to be restricted like those in undemocratic countries.  Americans are misinformed about our involvement with the Middle East due to various reasons, whether it be apathy, laziness, or ignorance, and its frightening to me to hear people commending the US and what we did, but not knowing the means.   If I wasn't so damn tired, I would write more, and perhaps I will... But in the meantime, embrace your freedom and your liberties and take advantage of the opportunities you have to educate yourself beyond the realms of your self-absorption.  There is so much more to know.

      I am starving and waiting for food to cook, so I figure there is no time like the present to blog.   I have come to the realization that I have been placed on this earth to be amusing to God, so He has some laughter as he is doing more important things.  My antics and doings are quite the laugh riot to those who aren't me as I sit back and smirk and wonder why these things happen to me.  Then I have to laugh too.  I need some good luck! Oliver had his Eurotrash party this weekend and it was quite entertaining.  Good times, great outfits, and band dancing - can't get better than that.  Oh yeah it could have....   Oh yeah, and I suck at Connect Four.   Fun fun.  Left around 3, dropped Karen off, then headed over to Aurora's to talk and contemplate why things happen to us.   I think my liver has decided to crumple up and die. Went shopping with Aurora in Philly yesterday.  On the way to picking her up, I crashed into a dumpster and now have a dent and a scrape on the back of my car.  ARGH!!!  Which is really irritating since my car is seminew and it's my favorite non-alive possession.  The papasan chair is a close second.  We hydroplane a few times going to Philly, but nothing we can't handle.  The coolest thing that happened to us while in the car was driving through the massive flood.  We were driving on Columbus Boulevard (Penn's Landing) when we noticed all of these cars were driving slow or stopping and a bunch of flashing lights ahead.  Yeah, the water flooded over and was utter craziness.  I have never seen anything like it so deep, and we went full force through it.  Woohoo. After Philly we went to Tyler's for dinner and the Reaching Jane Christmas Party.  Which meant open bar, which meant Aurora got drunk and it was fun.   Dinner is done.  Good bye.

      I started my Friday as always, at the record store.  Charise and I opened and in usual fashion analyzed why we are who we are and why we get so giddy at the most mundane things, but oh so very exciting.  I love her haha: "and so then hesaid 'charise, would you like to go upstairs and listen to jazz music?'"!!!!!!!!   The story of our lives.  No idea why we're so silly, but its fun.   Had a good show on WVUD, lots of callers, which was very cool.   Afterwards, Karen and I trekked to one of my favorite venues, the Recher Theatre in Towson, to see Jonasay and Cowboy Mouth.  It was bittersweet for me since I got hooked up with this band when they played the Cork with Cowboy Mouth last summer.  And its been such a crazy year and a half that introduced me so much more than just the Jonsay music.  Without Jonasay, there would not have been as many miles on the odometer, not as many animals hit, not as many states crossed, not as many secrets and inside jokes, and not as many rocking times.  From Maine to South Carolina, it was all golden.  So here we are again.   Karen and I did our customary stop at the Maryland House and made the usual phone calls on the way to Towson.  We were to meet Mark and Michael at the Rec Room for some drinks and food, but we ran late and the Recher changed the sound check time.  I don't know who reads this - besides the people who tell me they read this, especially on a daily basis ;-) - but I have been told about what comes up during certain vanity searches, so I censor myself alot on here, not out of fear of people knowing what I really think, but because I don't want to write entirely about others in a light that either could be embarrassing, too revealing, or downright mean.  Well screw it -- There are a certain group of people that we have consistently ran into at area shows.  Now, I have always been nice to this group of people for several reasons, first I met them on a professional basis, most I met while I was working with the band, second, their friends with the band, thirdly, I have no reason not to be - they're good people.  Apparently they find it necessary to look down on me and not even acknowledge me.  Perhaps its because I am so much younger than that certain group, but that shouldn't matter.  Also, I am not some crazy psycho fan - did I see any one of them on our treks from any of the Carolina to Maine shows where we went to work the merch and be supportive?  No.  I met the band by working with them, and fell for their music and friendship, don't be condescending because there are honest people who are passionate about the music in the industry.  So yeah, at the Recher, this whole group was pretty damn snotty.  Karen and I spent some of the night that we were waiting talking about that.  And hey you know what, don't look down on me when you're nearly twice my age and wearing crap that makes you think you are younger.  Mini skirts and boots?  Please.   Ok, now that that rant is over..... Karen and I head over next door and ran into Mark and met his friend Joe, who was also at the Logan House show.  We play catch up since we haven't really talked-talked in a while and the last time he called me, I hung up on him (though I still don't blame myself or my phone).  I now have yet another roommate when I move to NYC, let's just make a commune!   Prior to them hitting the stage, Joe joined us along the wall to participate in the cell phone game, where we call people that we haven't talked to in a while.  I do this because waiting for a show is pretty much the only free time I have haha.  So yeah, Phil, Rusty, and yes, Matt Fisher got their phone calls.  Matt got an actual job working in TV.  Yeaaah U of DE Comm degree!  He's working for a public access channel in Montgomery County (Maryland) and produced his first show the other night.  Congratulations!   The guys hit the stage and played for a little less than an hour.  Started with my favorite Jonasong, Stay.  Also on the setlist was Wish (I stayed), Fire in the Hole, Hero (new song by Michael), Call My Name, Gone Away, We Talk, Ultraman, and Queen's Fat Bottom Girls (sung by Michael).  Joe got some good shots with the digital.  All in all, the show was solid and Michael's vocals stayed strong depsite losing his voice recently.  Though the crowd was a bit sparse for being a Friday night, the stage presence was energetic.  Not playing as many shows recently really showed on stage as being more refreshed and less fatigued from living in a van careening down the highway from show to show.  Hero sounded awesome and it will be interesting to see how Michael's songwriting/performing comes out.  Karen and I danced like the crazies that we are and yelled loudly to embarrass them, though I don't think it worked.   Afterwards we hung out with Mike, Joe, and Mark and talked some more and compared recent shows and CDs we've checked out.  Cowboy Mouth was playing during our chatting and they are always an enjoyable band to see.  Great live show and their fans are intense.  I was able to catch some of the songs off of their new album (Uh Oh came out in October) and they sounded awesome.  I just love the fact that the frontman is the drummer. We load out and Joe, Mark, Karen, and I talk in the freezing cold next to the Silver Beast where after we conversed about porn and sex and cars, we decided that the Timonium Diner was the place to be.  So off we go, where Karen said the quote of the night-- Karen: I think I am too tipsy to be drunking. Me: You mean driving? Karen: Yeah that too. We get to the diner and talk some more and analyze certain situations we have placed ourselves in and enjoy many greasy and fattening foods.   As usual, there is no Jonasay show that goes as planned, but the path is always enjoyable.

      And I’ll be one of them..I’ll be one of them this time. (rb)  I am at work right now detoxing with mint tea and falafel.  Went to NYC last night.  I swear my body hates me.       After some radio time - ugh stupid callers, more on that later - I went up 95 to Summit NJ to catch the train into the city with Melissa, Rick, and Gabe for an evening of bar hopping.  We started drinking at a bar near the train station in NJ and apparently DE licenses are a novelty and took them about 15 minutes to figure out if it was fake or not.  Annoying.       Hopped the train and took a cab to our hotel, the Marriott on the East Side, to pregame.  Nothing ever changes.  We're in the 40's and want to go to the Village, so instead of cabbing it, we decided to walk and hit bars on the way there.  Melissa and I wanted to go to these Irish pubs we kept passing, but Rick and Gabe did not, forcing Melissa to yell out "alcohol is alcohol BITCHES" in front of everyone.  Classic.  Went to one place to consume the usual premium malt beverages, jager & red bull, and jack & coke  before busting a move to "whoomp there it is" and the milkshake song.  Went to some more bars, including Rodeo and The Hairy Monk, where we stole a glass.       Between the bars we caused a ruckus in the streets, all captured on film and posted soon.  Apparently I thought I was superman and found it necessary for my drunk ass to jump over every box laying out in the sidewalk.  I also think I hung off of some construction railings.  I am quite limber when inebriated.  We ended up at Burrito Loco, yes again, for foodage and more drinkage.  I think Melissa and I danced in the aisles again, but it was way more crowded than last time, so we were a bit hindered.  Ew, what is wrong with us - I just now remembered that Rick and I were toasting and taking "shots" of jalapeno peppers.  I have a high spicy tolerance and I think I abused it last night at the Mexican restaurant and now I wonder why I don't have any skin on the rough of my mouth.      Melissa wasn't feeling well at this point - she actually shouldn't be drinking at all - so I went back to the hotel with her while Gabe and Rick still wandered around the town.  We run through the hallways of the 19th floor and discover that the utility closet was left open.  Bad idea!  I took a broom and handfuls of other stuff while Melissa raided the blankets and toilet paper.  We didn't bring anything overnight related, so we stripped down and claimed the bed.  10 am came way too early.     Stupid assinine freaking holiday traffic.  I swear to god, people need to live by my rules of the road.  Some 80 year old woman putt-putting in the fast lane caused a 45 minute snarl.  And it took me another hour just to get over the DE Memorial Bridge.  Not good for my road rage.  I had to be at work at 5 and I rolled up at 5:10 and here I am now writing online because no one is in the store right now.

      Merry Christmas all!  Last night I went to midnight mass at the church across the street with Becca and it was enjoyable.  The church was decorated beautifully and it was just a good experience.   And today I slept in then went home for some holiday fun.  It was odd going home, I don't think I have been to my mom's house in about a year.  Trees were gone, roads were paved, and walls were painted.  Strange!  It was weird seeing all of the pictures of me throughout the years, granted they have always been there, but I noticed them again for the first time.  Made me really happy about everything I have gotten to experience in the past few years.  So funny, my mom has this wall of fame kinda thing with various pictures of stuff I have done with music in college and it reaffirmed my notions that NYC is the best decision I have made recently.   These past few months have been the only time I have really been on my own fending for myself.  Granted I lived in an apartment in college, but hell, that was college and my apartment then was 80 times nicer.  Everyone had a hoot on my recent endeavors here in 54.  I find it funny, whereas everyone else is worried about me.  Its normal to me to turn on my oven and leave the door of it open for heat when my radiators don't kick in.  Or having Squeeze Cheez and crackers for dinner when all I have is moldy stuff in the fridge.  Speaking of which, I still haven't thrown out those containers.  I'm afraid to look at them.  Or how I haven't cleaned my silverware in over a month and now the left part of my sink is full of utensils that I am just taking to Melissa's dishwasher instead of attempting to clean them.  They especially didn't enjoy how I fixed my broken window with some gaff tape and paper bag.  They shouldn't worry, my other window is propped open with a stick whenever the heat goes into overdrive.  Sigh.  :-)  But hey, home is where you make it and for me, this is perfect.  And speaking of perfect, no other way to end Christmas than with a jaunt to the bar with Karen.  See ya.

      If God is sending me messages, I am getting them loud and clear... Don't take your life for granted, and he is teaching me through Rainbow.  One of my Rainbow stalkers killed himself last night.  Ok, he didn't really stalk me, but each one of the Rainbow girls has a creepy male following that has become quite absorbed with what we do.  I actually knew this one though.  I met him last Christmas Eve, which is quite ironic, at our annual holiday dinner.  We always have the Christmas Eve festivities with the family of my mom's best friend.  Better than our actual family, and we've been doing it for about ten years now.  He was the son of the sister of the cousin of someone or something like that.  Can't really recall how he fit in somehow.  He was in his mid thirties and they all tried to set me up with him because "he's a nice guy and plays music - give him a chance".  No.  He was a bit creepy and followed me all around.  Nice guy, but way overbearing.  So overbearing that he started travelling out of his way to visit my store, and me.  Jen always seemed to work with me everytime he visited, so she knew the story and she would always save me from the weirdness.  He would always order clean rap music and stay in the store for a while listening to it.   And he always said bye to us strangely, with his half wave and wide eyes.    In a few hours, I'll be leaving for PA for the usual Christmas Eve festivities.  They didn't want me to know, but I found out anyways.

      I don't know how detailed I can get, but I will share with you a little of what has been going on...  I feel like I have been violated, that the one thing in my life that has been stable and secure has been tarnished.  I feel absolutely sick.    Rainbow was robbed sometime between the time I left it at night and the time I came in in the morning the next day.  Whoever it was was smart about it and took way more than we can afford, and did it with barely a trace.  It made me double check myself to see if we did everything right, if we locked all doors, etc.  I was the last one to check the back door, but I remember that it was locked.  It sucks that I have to doubt myself.  The Rainbow family is so tight it's unbelievable.  We've all been together for about 3 years and have gone through a lot of changes together.  Our friendship transcends beyond the store.  Breaking into our store is more like breaking into our home, and I guess more so for me.    The part that disgusts me the most, is how it probably happened.  The only thing that makes sense, is if someone hid in the back and waited till after we closed to do their thing.  In the back where we were after we closed. Someone could have been watching us and waiting for us without us even knowing it.  It gives me the chills and I am nearly in tears thinking about what could have happened that could have been extremely worse.  We are so lucky to be unharmed.  It turns my stomach to realize that this all happened literally right beneath my feet.  I didn't even hear anything.    I hung out with my neighbors last night because we all didn't feel like being alone.  I could barely sleep, awakening with every odd noise I heard.  I've always felt safe around here, nearly everyone I encounter I recognize or know someone who knows them.  I always love Newark around the holidays - the town is always in high spirits and everything looks so nice.  But its hard to enjoy that now.  I just feel so uncomfortable.  I don't know how long we were being watched, I don't know if I had looked at the robber at one point, I may even know this person, so much more could have happened, why us and why at this time?  I'm afraid.  I'm nervous to go up to my apartment at night, and even more afraid to go to my car, which is parked right next to the door in question.  This is the kind of thing that you expect to happen to someone else...but to everyone else, you are someone else.

      What an amazing weekend.    I know I have a penchant for writing detailed, sordid, and lengthy blogs, so bear with me.  I was at the record store in the morning then went on to have a great radio show with lots of callers - thank you, you rock.  But that isn't the fun stuff - ROAD TRIP!!  Karen, Melissa, and I decided to go to New York City for thirty hours of music, drinking, dancing, shopping, and randomness.  We met and exceeded our expectations.  We left around kickoff - 7pm - and listened to the UD football game until we lost signal in Jersey.  Before 95, we partook in the customary Wawa stop for dinner, which consisted of a pretzel and coffee.  Did you know that they have naked M & M's at a Jersey rest stop?  The M & M's seemed to have lost their colors.  Karen wouldn't buy them for us, she bought mentos instead.  We had to fill up the tank at the rest stop and being slow around someone who has an extreme sense of road rage is never a good idea.  First off, it took 10 minutes for me to even get to a pump since the pumpers were extremely slow.  Second, I told him to fill it and after he ran my card through, he only put 5 gallons in my car.  Ass.  While the gas was pumping, I kept rolling down Karen's window at the skeevy guys next to us.  Melissa and I thought this was a riot, then proceeded to play the penis game since we have the maturity of two twelve year olds.    We were on the way to Hoboken until I got us lost...oh come on...melissa says that i allow her to value her life more since i threaten it so often.  The Darkness carried us through New Jersey.  Awesome awesome awesome CD that I broke the girls into.  We ended up driving around and in the Newark Airport where I almost hit someone.  I didn't slow down, dude, I had the green light - hence my acceleration.  I saw the whites of his eyes emblazened with fear.  After a few trips back and forth between all of the 14 A, B, and C exits, we got to Hoboken and onto the PATH.  We were seperated on the subway, Karen sitting across from Melissa and me.  Our giddiness still has not worn off and a few minutes into the ride we decided to be scandelous and make crude motions to each other from across the train.   I don't think the other passengers enjoyed our sexual advances towards each other in public.  Off to Desmond's...  I've heard the stories of Desmond's and finally I got to experience the essence that is this fine establishment.  We got there a little after Green to Think started their set and quickly noticed the crowd and how very old we felt, though we're not that much older than of legal bar age.  The sound of the room was sub par, along with the static of the young, chatty, flamboyant acting students, but Maryellen and I still found the sounds enticing enough to make us dance.  Unfortunately for Karen, and Melissa, their first GTT show, the sound wasn't that good and the crowd we were around were too self absorbed.  Ken lost his glasses in the heat of the moment.  I can't remember if that was before or after the bra was thrown on stage.  Craziness.  Oh, I should keep a drink count while I write this as well.  By this time, there were  two mixed drinks consumed.  Maryellen wanted to hear "Its Christmas Eve" so I helped her yell it and they played it.  Aw!!  They played Sundays and Maryellen said how it reminded her of Dewey, so funny because now everytime I hear it to, it reminds me of that crazy time at the beach.  And how a certain lead singer forgot the words to the song he wrote - haha.  Another drink was had while we ogled at the happy gay guys dancing.  The girls know how much I love gay men, so I was pretty much in heaven.  Ok, so now the best part of the story is coming up, so I need a new paragraph, your shifting eyes will give you a moment to brace yourself.  So after the show, Karen and Melissa go to the bathroom while I talk to Dave.  Holy crap, I just had to stop for a few minutes because I was laughing so hard that I couldn't type, oh geez my sides hurt.  Ok, I am back and composed.  So Melissa runs out and tells me she needs my tissues - Karen had dropped stuff in the toilet.  So the girl was in one of the nastiest bathrooms in NYC, and of course there is no toilet paper in the nastiest bathroom in NYC.  Intead of shaking it like a polaroid picture, she searches for "a reciept or something" in her purse.  Items in her purse slip out and into the toilet, yes, the tainted unflushed toilet.  Caught up in the frantic moment, she plunges in to save her keys, cell phone, and a twenty dollar bill.  She left the change.  They rush out and immediately Karen douses herself in my gel hand sanitizer.  Her cell phone is drenched and ceased to operate.  So of course I had to tell everyone around what just happened in the Desmond's bathroom.  I plan to make Desmonds and GTT legendary by spreading the pee phone story.  So we're on stage all talking, well except for Chris, he doesn't speak to me :-P.  I can't remember much of the convo now because I am really tired now and slightly inebriated then.  On the GTT message boards, Ken's nationality has been mentioned, so I questioned.  He is in fact Italian (Adessa sure does sound Italian), and not Asian.  He claims he just "looks squinty" which confuses people and he is in fact a stunt cock and could not be if he was not italian.  It was decided that the night was not over and we would regroup at Siberia.  We hail a cab, and Karen got us a Rolls Royce to drive us in style to the club.  Karen whips out the pee soaked twenty then proceeds to tell the cabbie that the bill is wet because it was in alcohol and she saves those for special occasions.  Very seductively she added that the bill dropped in a pool of sex on the beach.  Melissa and I were laughing so hard we were crying.  We told Steve we wanted to dance and be crazy and he sent us to Siberia, though it had an awesome atmosphere, it was chill.  So we found residence at a corner couch and talked.  Now we are onto beer.  We make some phone calls and find out the DE won the national title game 40-0 so we celebrate and we celebrated a bit too loudly.  Steve also warned us that the club has two rules: no hitting on women, and no cussing.  The girls yelled at me because I broke rule number two many many times.  So we're hanging out massaging each other -  kinky, but apparently I give good head massages and I'm like a pillow, so yeah we are draped on each other when Steve, Ken, Jodie, and some other people meet us.  We talk for a bit then decide to leave and find food, specifically eggs since Melissa was craving them.  I was trying to find my jacket, so I would reach down and thought I had my jacket but I was actually grabbing Kens hand.  This wouldn't be funny if I didn't try doing it like five times and kept forgetting that his hand wasn't my jacket. We stumble and jump around on the streets of NYC in search of an open late night eatery.  En route we played with my Rainman like mind with its uncanny ability to remember mundane things - or things that I just find important.  And I remember laughing and smiling a lot. It just felt so awesome to feel so free and unrestrained, that everything was right there within my grasp.  Amazing; the sky was dark, the buildings flickered with the fire from construction, the lights dazzled, and Steve said the sidewalk sparkled just for me.    As we were riding the subway to Hoboken, there was a man who was well dressed and a bit intoxicated holdingonto one of the bars.  The subway jerked and the guy spun around and SLAMMED into the wall.  It was so damn hilarious because he never let go of the bar, he just swung around.  then he acted as though nothing happened.  It wouldnt have been funny if he was hurt, but he acted so  nonchalantly about it as if he didn't just cause a commotion on the subway.  I had directions to Steve & Dave's, but somehow during my drive I forgot them.  As I am driving, I am thinking I go turnpike to 78W to 3 to Bloomfield.  How in the hell did I just remember that?  Regardless, we got off on Bloomfield Ave (sidenote....who puts Bloomfield Ave in Nutley, the town next to Bloomfield!!??!?!) and we drove around for a while.  A long while.  We got the scenic route and I sobered up which was a good thing I suppose.  And my park job in front was excellent.  The best ever.  So damn straight.    After a few hours of sleep, Dave asks if we should get Chinese.  Just like last time, nothing beats Chinese food for breakfast.  Or I guess technically lunch since it was afternoon.  After everyone collectively made fun of my parking job since it was blatantly obvious in broad daylight, we packed up and went to Peking Cuisine.  Karen and I don't eat meat, and we ordered the Won Ton soup with our meals.  Since I have been sick, I figured I would just have the broth since the soup has meat in it.  Karen didn't know that the soup had meat in it and ate it all.  So we enlightned her after, though Dave tried to tell her it was tofu.  Karen's phone was still dead - oh, just a reminder, she dropped it into a dirty toilet and fetched it - so Steve evaluates the problem.  After a few moments I realized that he had protected his hands from the pee phone with napkins - so damn funny.  Don't worry, we got a picture.  Melissa offered us all gum and Steve declined since he didn't want to use his hands since his hands touched the napkin that touched the pee phone.  Instead, he pulled his sleeves over his hands and launched the gum in.  I was nearly in tears.    Steve gave me real directions to Hoboken (screw you Mr. Rand McNally) and we were off for another random day in the city.  We were all freezing and tired, but the skyscrapers awaited us.  First stop was H & M.  Oh my it was three floors of clothing goodness.  We found crazy pants, modeled freakish accessories, and played in the underwear.  Melissa and I found neon leopard print pants though Karen wouldn't let us try them on.  She said she was doing her friend duty.  We hit up the village next to bar hop.  We got off of the NYU exit and I showed the girls some of the buildings that I will hopefully be around next fall (cross your fingers).  We found Burrito Loco and started the night off with a shot that was on fire.  You drink it through the flames in a straw.  Melissa ha promised that it would be good, but the girl also likes tequila.  Karen said my look was priceless and I swear to god, I have no more esophagus.  We ordered food and more drinks and took crazy pictures.  We were the only ones downstairs and felt that we should dance in the aisle since there was Latin music playing.  Karen and I attempted to Samba and shook our hips while the whole kitchen watched.  Melissa joined and and we were three crazy white girls getting down with the salsa.   After drinks and dancing, we walked down 4th to another bar, The Slaughtered Lamb.  Damn I just love the Village.  Another awesome bar where we had our drinks while staring out the window creating stories for the passerby.  Karen saw a jewelry shop and she thought I would like it so we go in.  I have a fascination with large and chunky and glaring bracelets.  So I found things that made me happy and left with a slightly heavier bag than before.  We found a Moroccan bar, Absolutely 4th, and sat on the stools and enjoyed more drinks.  A dark, artsy atmosphere colored with friendly characters.  Melissa met Ed, who bought us a round of wine and we all sat and talked like old friends.  He was a retired Marine and now just spending his time on the town. While broadcasting on Friday, this woman - Dina, had called in for information and we ended up talking and knowing the same people.  I had told her I was going to NYC to see GTT and hang out and she said that she would be at a club in NYC with another band I had heard of on Saturday night.  So we decided to check that out, and spent the rest of the evening at the Acme Underground.  Beer was had here.  In between sets the club played the Darkness, I swear I don't think any group of kids got more excited over house music then we were.  The band Copper Pot took the stage and were really good.  Melissa and I danced like crazies and had a great time jumping around.  Afterwards I think we took a cab back to the PATH and headed for Hoboken.  We took pictures in the subway station and somehow Melissa and I found ourselves on the ground.  Stopped in Dunkin Donuts for caffeine for the trek home. I drove us home from the city in less than two hours, I rule.  I could barely keep my eyes open though.  Too many consecutive nights of barely sleeping caught up with me on the road.  Got home around 2 am and crashed.    The whole trip was euphoric, so amazingly happy with the company.  I am so lucky to be surrounded by such whole hearted, positive, and energetic people.  Thank you New York, I'll see you soon.

      There are a few things I like a lot.  And if you know me, you can guess that I am partial to diners, alcohol, and live music.  Usually the course of any given night is go see a show, drink some, then hit up a diner.  Which is fine by me.   Anne Ashley and Michelle have been going to the Manayunk Diner recently and discovered that one can enjoy the aforementioned things simultaneously.  Hallelujah!!! After work on Tuesday Karen and I drove an hour just to go to this diner with Michelle and AA.  Oh but it was worth it.  Once again we revisit the eggs and kegs tradition, though this time, a little more refined haha.  Martinis with waffles and wine with an egg salad sandwich.  And afterwards open mic.  Sweet.

      So after the show, Justin stops by - and says HELLO to Karen...and by hello i mean....  then turns to me and tells me i am a scarecrow.  he notices my blank look and I inquire if that is an insult, because all I think is the Wizard of Oz and how the Scarecrow does not have a brain.  He surprised me by telling me how genuine the Scarecrows is and how he emits nothing but love and goodness and how I exude that whenever I am around and he is glad for that.  Complimentary, but very odd for Justin to say that to me.  Boggling.

      Catching up on the old blogger...  On Sunday, Jonasay played at the Iota so Karen and I decided to make a day of it and hang out in Arlington.  It didn't quite happen that way.  I got off work a little early to save on time, but as soon as we hit 95 we seriously went about 30 MPH.  It took us 2 hours to get to Baltimore (usually an hour drive), so I figured detouring on 695 would be longer mileage, but a more efficient drive.  So we did and we got off on the wrong exit and ended up in the ghetto of Baltimore.  The exit sign for 95 was right next to the exit before and we took that one.  At least we could see the stadium, so we drove towards that.  Karen yelled at me for looking at the vagrants on the street.  And 4 hours later we get to Arlington.  We made it before doors so we cruised Barnes & Noble and Cosi.  The door guy at the Iota is always cool and messes with me since we were guestlisted.  Onward!  We grab our drinks - wine for Karen, vodka for me - and chat with Mike.  He then informs me that he read my online journal and told me that he should be in it more.  I hope I didn't offend him with any of the other comments I made about the Recher show.  Hmm ironic that none of the usual fans were there.  I kinda feel bad about the things I have said, but it had to be done.  Especially when you're mean to me for no reason.  Haha why am I so bitter?  I just can't deal with annoyances.    So yeah, wander around talking to people then go up front since we decided we're gonna dance and our whole goal was to make Mike laugh during the show.  I should add that Mike is the drummer.  Started off with my favorite song, so that is always fun.  Autumn (from NC) and Chris (Justins brother) were next to us, so we caused a ruckus center stage.  Mark and I made faces at each other and I tried to make Mike laugh but all he wanted to be was a camera whore striking poses.  Michael busted out his song Hero, which was even better this time than last time.  So I look over to Karen and notice she is writing her number on a napkin to the guy in LP.  I didn't think I made a look, but I guess it was a shocked look because when I check the stage the guys are all looking at me and laughing.  Mark points at Karen and I just shrug, yay Karen.    After the encore we hung out and talked.  Justin told me I was a scarecrow (more on that later).  We load the stuff out then hit up IHOP with Mark.  Very interesting conversation.  I get yelled out for being crude, but everyone else can say what they want - no fair!  So I spill my issues over my omelette, then we leave.  Mark can barely stay awake, so I drove his silver beast back to his house - a 45 minute drive - while Karen followed.  Poor girl, I was weaving everywhere and almost missed my exits since I had no idea where I was going since I never went from that direction. I fall asleep on our way back to Delaware.  Work in the morning.  And work now, so I will finish blogging later on tonight.

      A few thoughts on this evening:  Hmmm...so its against the law to walk down main street with a coors light?  who would have guessed.  I knew the cop and he laughed at me for being a dumbass.  Technically I was only outside of the store.  Shit, that makes it sound even worse.   And hi DUI.  Not me though.  But seriously now - the cops were rounding people up in the lot for the sobriety check.  YOU DON'T GET INTO YOUR CAR THAT IS PARKED RIGHT NEXT TO THE COPS AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN DRINKING.  Poor girl, at least Aaron's parents picked them up.  Michelle and I threw a couch off of our roof, we rule.  It didn't bust as much as we anticipated.    Oh damn, Mike is outside of my window yelling at the people at Dunkin Donuts and the boys just rounded him up.  We seriously went to Dunkin Donuts at least 6 times since 11 pm tonight, they love us.    Speaking of Mike, I tied his shoes around the table and the table went FLYING.  Part of the table is held together with duct tape, so it wasn't the first time it fell over tonight.  And margerita mix with vodka looks and tastes like Hi-C ecto cooler.   Holy crap Mike is screaming outside of my window again.  Hey, you all would be proud of me, I only drank not much tonight.  Soco and fruit punch I am such the chemist.  We partied over at the apartment across the alleyway from me, and we ended up throwing shit onto each others porches half the night, its gonna suck cleaning up.  In the midst of dancing on the rooftop I brushed my head against one of the many wires crossing over us.  Guess one does not get electrocuted that way.    I seriously wonder how I get through my days...

      Just thought you would like to know...  I decided to make Thai food for dinner, in the microwave.  yes, I try to find the easy way around cooking.  And yes, dinner is at 10:37 in the evening.  The damn package tells me 5-7 minutes, so I put it in for 6.  I'm watching TV and hear a crackling noise, so I ignore it.  The crackling does not subside so I assess the situation.  A bowl full of Thai stuff is now nuked and crusted to the bottom of my bowl.  Only after 4 minutes!  4 MINUTES!!!  Damn you lying package.  Ahhh at least I can make a mean grilled cheese.

      This guy smells.   "People are a pain in my ass" - Rainbow Chris  That sums it up.  Ok, for the past three years, this guy has come in every single freaking day.  Sometimes twice a day.  And I have never seen him in a different outfit ever.  Ever ever ever ever and its gross.  And its not like the man doesn't have money, he has spent enough here to buy a car - a nice car.  He remembers CDs, all classical, by their number and asks us to recall them and order them.  Which is fine, but when they aren't in the system, he freaks out.  And he thinks I am incompetent if its not in the system.  As if I can't type in 10 numbers.  What an insult when he leaves me and asks someone else the same damn question he asked me.   Like I said before, he comes in every day.  And the same question "did you get a shipment in today".  Now - if he can mentally recall all of these numbers for years, you would think by now he will know when we get our shipments.  And we also think that by now he should know that he is the only one that readily buys classical in our store, so unless he orders it, we don't have it in.  There is no need to waste pur patience on his obsessiveness.  Ew, he also orders multiple copies of stuff.  Like a CD he bought 3 months ago, he wants a second copy of.  I highly doubt he is buying it for anyone, and its not like it wore out in 3 months.   He's crazy.    I wouldn't be so disgusted by him if he wasn't so damn rude.    Sorry for my Rainbow rant, but geez.  Chris and I want to follow him home one day just to see where he lives.  We all have our philosophies on him.  The most prevelant one being that he was crazy and kicked out of his country and has a steady fund coming from whoever kicked him out.  We can't imagine him working anywhere.   I often wonder if he goes into the other stores and asks for product by serial numbers.

      seriously now.  mike is just so damn amazing and i am so happy i met him and he is in my life.  i hope i rock his world.  mike is near perfect, from his amazing shaker skills to well.... i am at a loss for words to tell you how fantastic this guy is.  and super cool.  driving around in the van with him is the highlight of my life.  he also listens to my drunk babbling while sitting in his boxers.  and we like the same alt country bands because we enjoy angsty crooners with a drawl.  mike leach is the definition of rock and roll.  Know it and embrace it.   :-)  Hahaha.  Ok, so Mike tells me last night that he reads this and that I should post more about him, so there you go.  He was a bit upset and almost hated me for not writing all about him at the Recher.  Hope ya didn't get too offended ;-).

      Today is rock and roll.  Woke up and came down to the record store.  Then went right to my radio show until 4.  Ran across the street with Becca for dinner, then here again at the store until we close.  But after...the girls will be heading to the Logan House.  Marlon Spike is opening for Ike.  This should be interesting.  And by interesting...I mean I never know how an evening with my twin (jen), the ike crew, premium malts, cameras, the MS crew, and jimmy ends up.  Dancing will ensue and I am sure the lesbian card will have to be pulled out.

      Here I am wondering why my whole body aches since I haven't done any sort of exercise in about a week.  Yup, then I remembered that we had the brilliant idea of sliding down Melissa's stairs on a papason pillow Wednesday night.  I should stay away from stairs.

      Ok ok ok, I am a week and some change late.  Oddly enough, there were no big shin digs being thrown this year, so Karen and I left DE and cruised to NJ.  Steve invited us to Morita's gathering, so why not.  Hours before we left - I have no idea how we wasted hours, time gets lost on us - we rocked out to RHCP and talked to her mom.  We love putting our parents on edge.  "Don't you girls want jackets?"   "you know, you girls can always stay here and celebrate with us" "where's your hat, you need your hat, its cold outside" "don't drink and drive and make sure you sleep at some point" Oh geez, parents are funny. We went to the liquor store and realized we forgot to eat dinner, so of course, Wawa was our victim.  I swear they have the best mac and cheese ever.  You know whats fun?  Driving and shifting and eating mac and cheese at the same time.  I think shortly after we crossed the DE Memorial bridge my dinner ended up on my shirt.  So of course cleaning it up was at the top of my priorities, not driving.  And why is it that usually I have everything crucial in my car except for napkins!!  So I pulled a Karen and used a receipt.  She captured it on film.  It looked pretty scandalous, me rubbing myself and all, but it wasn't.   We get to Chris's and start the festivities.  Wine for Karen and Cran Vodka and Sprite for me....more on that later.  We spent the first half hour talking to Dave and Dareen about how our handwriting sucks and we can't spell anymore due to their convenience of computers.  Hey now, unless it has a red line underneath it, it's spelled right!  I also have the handwriting of a nine year old boy.  Also on how we hate the phone, if you don't have email or AIM, more than likely, I don't talk to you that much.  :-) Apparently I have a problem keeping all of my drink in the cup - hey, at least it was clear.  Yeah.  And also I guess I was too dangerous with what was in my cup and was informed that Steve dumped it out and added more soda, and it was still too strong.  Ha - got ya!  Karen drank a whole bottle of wine, all by herself - we know how to do things right.  Ew and Steve thought it wouldbe a good idea to do a jager shot, so we did, except for Ken I think.  Karen, Katie, and I talked about how much 80's fashion ruled.  Hmmm...Dareen, Katie, and I sported New Years Eve hats for the countdown.  After midnight we all went outside to light some sparklers, I don't remember ever touching fire, I don't think I was allowed to.  Steve stole my sparkler, but came back with it in the shape of an M so it was ok that I couldn't play with fire.  This probably sounds choppy - but hey, that is how I remember it.   Hmmmm.  This is where it gets fuzzy.  But the highlight of the night was Steve and I challenging each other in state capitals.  I think we sickened eeryone within hearing distance because we kept getting them right and the game lasted far longer than I think we both expected - I can hold my own.  We got stuck on Montana, but it's Helena.  Quirky like that. Around 4 am Morita busted out his guitar and well, yeah, I started singing.  Radiohead and Howie Day.  I didn't get anything thrown at me, so that is good.   We left shortly after that andhit up a Dunkin Donuts for caffiene and Karen proceeded to make the counter guy feel bad for spending his new years at work.  Nah, I am sure she didn't but I teased her about it.  Babbling to Karen and having a CD on repeat pretty much describes the drive back.  And I hit those "wake up bumps" quite a few times.

      Does anyone beside me think a whole can of soup is a serving?  Seriously now, one can does not feed 2.5 people.  Tomato soup is my favorite store soup and goldfish crackers in the soup is even better.  Now the geniuses at Campbell's added goldfish shaped cheddar pasta to their tomato soup.  Nice.  Vegetable soup - does anyone eat all of the vegetables in it?  I don't like the green beans.  They are squishy - blech.  And spaghetti-o's are so damn delicious.

      i think i am still drunk from last night and being here at work is far worse than sleeping in my bed.    charise is down the street buying me a bagel since that is the best thing ever right now.    i can't even think and i am so not drinking anything until the 9th.  Maybe not even then.  Ow.    No one is in the store, the one guy who came in i think was scared and left since i was explaining to charise why i suck as a person.  Yay charise is here, time to eat and suck less as a person.

      Radio show went well.  Spent half of it talking to Chris M. (looks I need to start putting clarifiers since oddly enough in the past few months I have met 5067 chris's) and Maryellen via emails as they helped me pick my setlist and the other half juggling the million callers that called the station.  And Maryellen called from NYC, so that was awesome, WVUD needs to be aired on our holds now haha.    Chris L. came down to the station to play some recorded live tracks and talk on air.  Madanant doesn't do his show anymore, so I have some openess after my show to play around with.  So we played some tunes and informed the listeners what's going on in the Marlon Spike world.   Chris aptly named the hour "Marlon Spike Radio" and did my legal stuff with flying colors.  It was hilarious.  I forgot I had traffic, so it was an interesting segway after Gary told us about the snarl on Casho Mill Road, that I asked Chris about the roadways going to the Grape.  And problems on Casho Mill!?  Smallest road in Newark?  Chris was all organized with his list as I was the usual disheveledness.  But we crossed off everything on his check list, including talking about my mother on air.  And Clay Aiken and his mentoness.  But yeah, a fun, random, crazy time on air as we pirated WVUD.  Chris dropped me off at home and I hit up the store before heading to my place so I could talk to Charise.  I love Charise because she knows all about my craziness and we'll talk about one thing which will lead to eight others.  In the midst of four different stories, my phone rings, and though I expected it to be the customary call from my mom after my radio show, it was Phil.  Phil!  One of my favorite people ever, and I haven't spoken with him since Dec 6.  So he's all excited and I run outside and I have no idea what the point of the phone call was, but we chatted and he introduced me to Chris, the newest member of LDE, and I spoke with him for a while, then back to Phil.  Phil said something that we should all get drunk and be crazy and then I said we'll run through the streets with our clothes off.  Yeah, I said this outside my store loud and a few people turned their heads.  I wasn't serious!    I picked up Melissa and she feared for her life before we even picked up dinner.  I got in the wrong lane and I didn't appreciate her screaming for her dear life as I cut across the other lanes in front of fastly approching cars.  And my u-turn rocked as I burned rubber.  I swear the girls knuckles were white, but it was fun :-).  Hit up Wawa for subs and the Newark Wawa is still incident free for 69 days.    We ate and watched the Newlyweds marathon before Tanya came over.  Melissa also was brave enough to go into my fridge and found eggs that I have had in there since August growing fur.  Maryellen called me and it was almost as great as Phil's call.  She was a bit tipsy in NYC and we talked about boys and being gutsy and how we really are good people haha.  I meant to call her at some point in the night, but the evening flew by, so perhaps a phone call tonight...  Tanya came over and we plotted - hehe sounds devious - and started drinking.  Rick, Chris, Dan, Matt, Jess, and Derek came over to find us pretty much almost hammered.  Tanya had to be up super early to teach, but that didn't stop her.  Having fun and losing ones self takes priority over responsibility.  Chris started hardcore and owned the raspberry vodka, downing quite a few shots before we all headed out to Continental.  We decided that bringing the cranberry vodka bottle with us was a good idea.    Hung out at Continental for a while, which is incidently Derek's old apartment.  The complex reminded me of the time that Derek terrorized someone from his window and feared for his life.  I forgot that I wasn't supposed to tell anyone, but it was over 2 years ago, so all is fair.  Feels weird that Derek and I trade off old college stories from back in the day.  Derek mentioned that he was moving to NYC in May which snowballed into talking about the music scene here and there.  And how we try to kid ourselves that there is a semblance of a scene here in Delaware, but we are all pretty much the scene.  And when we all relocate to NYC, there will be no scene - haha.  Sorry, Delaware.    Rick knew someone at the party and turns up the kid worked for him, so he felt weird.  With a school with over 18,000 people, you'd be surprised how small it really is.  So unfortunately Rick and Melissa left a little early.  Tanya and I team up for some beer pong against Dan and Matt and were doing pretty well, I thank Tanya's song and dance.  But of course they get the same cup which means automatic defeat for Tanya and me.    I think some guy was being a jerk, so we left, but not before Dan stole a beer for him and me for the walk home.  We leave and drink for the trek back to my place then busted out the vodka bottle and each of us hit that up while walking on Main Street.  What is wrong with us?!?!  Get back to my place and Chris works his iPod magic and we make concotions in the kitchen.  For some reason we found it necessary to badly sing Biz Markie while it wasn't playing and only the chorus.  The PB & J was busted out as was chains of drinking.  Tanya caught all of this on film, so they will be on my site shortly.  Tanya had a vodka bottle with her the whole time and kept misplacing it.  Matt gave us an entertaining rendition of Ben Jelen's song as we watched the music video.  Dan was calmly standing around and his drink exploded on him and Jess.  Around 4:30 everyone left except for Aurora.  We were both plastered and a bit afraid to sleep because we may die if we close our eyes by spinning around too much.  So we stay up and talk about the paths our lives have taken in the past few months and whose we have intertwined with and realize that lifes been good.  Pass out around 6ish and wake up around noon for work.  We can barely function and decide that going to the bagel shop is the best thing to start our days.  We couldn't even bear to hear the word "drink".  I think our bodies are like sponges and they just couldn't absorb anything more.    There ends my Friday's festivities.  And as soon as I get out of work - which is hopefully soon...Aurora and I will be jetting down to Baltimore to see LDE.  I'm looking out the window and the snow is quickly falling, but that is just an added adventure.  I think we are more excited to hng out with them since its been way too long, than we are about actually seeing the show.  But their new stuff is so damn good.  And of course, its a different lineup than the last time.  Goodbye Javi and hello Chris.  You know you are way too involved when some changes bring sorrow...  But hey, Phil tells everyone we are around I am his tour manager and he called me up so I could meet and talk to Chris, and they are all so excited for tonight.  Phil knows we are leaving as soon as I get off of work, so he said they won't play until I get there.  So we must a cause a scene when we get to the funk box.    Ok, my boredom has allowed me to write enough, so I am outta here.  More adventures tomorrow.

      I will not start this blog off with what I want to say.  In fact, I  may not even address it on here.  But after work, I went to the bar.  I needed to get out, so the girls - Aurora, Tanya, Melissa, & Karen - went to the East End for beverages and appetizers.  Chris, Dan, and Jen met up with us shortly afterwards as we plotted against our sucky waitress, repeated statements, embarrassing stories, and contemplated on the superpowers of Wayne.    The funniest part of the evening has to be while we were all consuming our beers and premium malts, Chris ordered a Long Island Ice Tea, which is one tasty beverage and perfectly acceptable in the mixed drinks realm.  But instead of a normal LI Ice Tea in a normal glass, it was served with more fruit garnishes than neccessary and in a slim girly glass.  Moreover, it did not taste how a LI Ice Tea should taste.  It was a bit scary and threw the whole semblance of the table off.    Karen and Melissa left so we went to Wawa.  I don't know who's idea it was to go to Wawa, (jen's...?) but I don't think we needed to go, but of course Wawa is always a perfect stop.  On the way we tried to guess how many days since that Wawa was incident free.  Last Saturday (jan 9), the Wawa had been incident free for 16 days.  HOW HOW HOW is the Wawa now incident free for 69 days!??!?!  It was only 6 days ago!!!!!    Back to the apartment where we drank and listened to some of the MS SPF VII recording.  Aurora and Jen pirated my computer, so hopefully no one got any weird IMs, but at least Aurora's living situation next year may be solved.  Chris made my speakers work, so after being stereo-less for four months, I can now listen to CDs on a normal system.    Yeah, and I forgot that I have a radio show to do today, so I tired to plan it in the 15 minutes I had before work.  Don't blame me if it sucks, blame my course of events yesterday.

      Hmmm...perfect?  Aurora and I got the hell out of Delaware and went to NYC for the evening for the usual night of adventures and wonderment.  "Dream on, dream on as I may I get a little closer every day To what I think it should be. I drive a little bit further, further A little further down the road." RB  We headed to the Village to catch Ryan Montbleau opening up for the guys of Little Feat at the Lion's Den.  So of course we went early to see what we see.  Caught up on our craziness on 95 while the sounds of Ryan M, Graham Colton, Akiva, Phantom Planet, Ryan Adams, and Tyler Hilton serenaded us.  The Swifts were on road in fleets and we decided that double blue swifts count double, so all in all we saw 31 on the way up...i think.  We decided to just drive into the city instead of hoboken and oddly enough we found a free parking spot right in front of the venue.  we rule.    A lady walking her dog stopped me as we were hanging out outside and informed me that I left my interior light on.   So nice, it would not have been cool to come back to a dead battery.  Again, I stand by my sentiments that NYC is the most empathetic city, though people beleive the opposite.  Perhaps because mostly everyone there are strangers and personal ties don't interfere with good will.    We walk over to Burrito Loco, which is now becoming an NYC tradition, for dinner and to talk about porn.  We are staring at three porn shops while eating, of course it was bound to come up.  Afterwards we walked into a store where Aurora bought a hat because it was cold and I did my customary jewelry purchase.  I found this awesome handmade chunky ring made with raw green garnet.  Rock on, none like it anywhere ever.  Came outside and it was snowing.  So damn beautiful.  Huge flakes careening down dusting the city.  The lights and the sidewalks sparkled and we slid our way back to Sullivan.  Overheard two guys singing "winter wonderland" and it really was.  Walked around some more and found ourselves in a record shop doing what we do best.  Warmed up in a car for a bit listening to music then went inside the Lions Den.  Cute venue, smaller than I expected but good atmosphere.  Wasn't really that crowded so we found a table and sat next to two other girls who were also there to see the opening act.  We talked to them a little bit...Krista from Queens, and I didn't catch the other girls name...but she was like the NYC version of us, liking the same music and discovering new artists, so that was fun.  Ryan came on and played an awesome set list, which I wrote down on a piece of paper with other ramblings of that day, but I left it in my car, so look for the setlist on my site later.  There was an older taper there - presumably for Little Feat - who grooved out.  It was hilarious.  I took notice of "brown jacket boy" and towards the end of the set he and his friend came over to us and we met new people, new people who run a venue in NY.  Again, we rule.    Ryan's voice is abolsutely amazing and I am sure you are sick of me ranting and raving over this kid, but its all true.  He broke two strings while playing and since he wanted to be a cool rockstar jumping from cab to cab in NYC, he only brought one guitar.  So as he is restringing with his eyes closed, he sings a little Paul Simon, then his intro song to his cd - City.  Captivating.  He also played Perfect, which is absolutely beautiful.  So funny, I was describing the song to a friend of mine, "it's like 'hi ryan, tear my heart out'".  Yup, that's it.  And our concertmate Krista said the same exact thing.  Aurora and I share the sentiments that this song is John Mayer's Comfortable.    We leave the venue after Ryan played and were greated by a blanket of snow everywhere.  It was incredible.  Hehe, we get off on the excitement of driving home with an added adventure.  While Aurora smoked, I talked on the phone with Steve as he warned me to be careful and not to get lost and not to call him at 4am.  We made our own tracks through the city and found our way out.  We decided to stop in Hoboken before hitting the Turnpike because though Dunkin Donuts coffee isn't better than Wawa coffee, it is better than random NJ rest stop coffee.  I couldn't find a spot to park in, so I made my own in front of a fire hydrant.  We get our goods at DD and while on the phone with my mom, I exclaim "oh shit, there's a cop with his lights on heading to my car!" and drop the phone in my bag.  So I pass off my latte to Aurora and start running to my car.  And by running, I mean jogging very carefully on the ice while trying not to fall down, blind myself with the falling snow, or careening into any of the passengers who just got off the PATH and were obstructing my route to my car.  The cop pulled next to my car, but never stopped and I quickly made a scene by trying to not set off my alarm and not run into my car from skidding on the ice.  Nice.  Poor Aurora was left in the cold trying to hold onto everything w hile dodging the passengers as well.  Oh well,  no ticket.  So we head out for an exhilerating ride home.  Yeah.  As we were heading up to NYC, Aurora mentioned the sound of my brakes.  I informed her that there are two things we will not bring up regarding my vehicle, first being my squeaky brakes, the second being the fact that I should have changed my oil 2,000 miles ago.  The plows weren't out yet, so I scoot-scooted my Cabrio along the Turnpike going about 30 miles an hour while slipping and sliding all over the damn place.  What was usually a three lane highway turned into a free for all, as was determined by the amount of cars that had run into the barriers.  Woohoo!!  So Aurora and I talked random stories while my knuckles were white from trying to keep my car from spinning out during the 135 mile endeavor.  Hydroplaning, and swerving, and playing on the ice is fun throughout New Jersey.  Finally I gained some control and composure and hit it up to 5th gear and 60 miles an hour and just owned the road for the trek back.  I wouldn't have been so hesistent before if there wenre't that many cars on the road.  Once the cars all disappeared, the road was ours.  Tyler Hilton's Rollin' Home and Swifts were great great company.    And I have a fear of driving over bridges, yeah doing it on ice with no plowing of the roads was great.  We got to DE and realized that DE lost in the snow storm, they barely got anything.  Losers.  We drove right through it and got the most out of it.   Rock on.

      ARGH!!!!!!  Now, I never did like Bush, but seriously...what has he been thinking lately?!?!?!?  Yes, while our economy sucks and the job market isn't any better, lets have the nation spend an excrutiating amount on space travel and marriage.  MARRIAGE!!!  I could write for hours on this, but I only have a few minutes.  But seriously.  Ok, for example, there could be plenty of healthy GAY marriages that would provide a loving household for children, but no, Bush won't allow that.  But he will shovel out millions trying to mend broken unhealthy heterosexual marriages.  Some people aren't meant to be married to one another, some people make mistakes, and some people just aren't capable of being in a healthy relationship.  But no, lets try to make those work instead of supporting the ones that do.  I swear, forget getting out of DE, get me out of the US.  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bush administration officials are planning a $1.5 billion election-year initiative to promote marriage, especially among low-income couples, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.   Administration officials have worked with conservative groups for months on the proposal, the paper said, and are weighing whether President Bush should promote the plan next week in his State of the Union address.   The plan would provide at least $1.5 billion for training to help couples develop interpersonal skills that sustain "healthy marriages," the paper said.   According to the Times, the officials said they believed the measure was timely because they were facing pressure from conservatives eager to see the federal government defend traditional marriage, after the highest court in Massachusetts ruled in November that gay couples had a right to marry.

      Rainbow Chris and I are going to jump out the window because we are so damn bored.  On another note, Maryellen, Chris M., and I exchanged fifty million e-mails today on how we're going to tear up Philadelphia next week and start our own business, but not in Philly, or maybe in Philly - who knows.  This is what we do when we are all supposed to be at work.  :-) Watch the hell out for Mirchrisma.  Has a nice ring, don't you think?  But it's top secret on what it is.  We rule.    New York City tomorrow!! Then back to Delaware...then back to New York City on Friday...then back to Delaware.  New York City is becoming the next day trip.  I would have been there three times in like 10 days.  I can't help it.

      So I have this hot beverage travel mug.  It's green and I like it a lot.  But it has been causing me problems.    Now, if you are to have a green hot beverage travel mug, one would think that that green hot beverage travel mug would be microwavable.  Especially in this day in age where we all try to attain things as quickly as possible.  Why does a green hot beverage travel mug exist in a non microwavable form? Why Why Why?  This causes me wasted time in the morning by heating my tea in a  microwavable  container, then transferring it into my green hot beverage travel mug.   Sigh.

      Haha since I am in a copy/paste kinda mood, I figured I would let you into one of my closest friend jen's life...  While I drove to Hoboken on Tuesday, Jen and Karen went to see Jonasay's last live show.  I just couldn't do it.  Too much of myself has been wrapped up in that band for me to go to anything semi-final.  I just felt really great on how far along we have all grown together.  I introduced Jen and Karen, among others, to the Jonatunes, and I was just so very happy that they went and we kept in contact via cell.  Gotta love technology.    I almost cried reading this from laughter and sorrow and the reminder of how much fun we all have when we go out: [And sadness and pleasure so close together...I can’t seem to tell the difference...Better take it all, I guess. - ryan montbleau] From Jen's online journal (yes, we all have them, we're all so damn busy this is the only way we know what is really going on with each other)  "Last night I went with the lovely Miss Karen to Baltimore to see Jonasay play.  I haven't seen Karen in ages, so it was great to catch up with her and find out what she's been up to.  We got to the bar, a nice place in Fells Point called Horse You Came In On, which is an odd name for a bar come to think of it.  We said hi to the guys and talked to a fan...we think his name was Havek? who bought us each two beers, which was quality.  He also is a gynocologist and proceeded to tell us stories about his patients all night - which is the very reason Karen and I said we'd never want to go to a male gynocologist.  But he was pretty cool and free beers, so no complaints.  During the set Karen and I got a little carried away dancing with each other, which prompted this old guy - had to have been at least 60 - to come up to us repeatedly and try to dance or flirt or Lord knows what, all we know is it was reallly nasty.  We tried to play the lesbian card but I think that only turned him on more, and we kept catching him over with his friends pointing at us.  But that didn't stop the dancing.  Aside from the scary touchy grandfather type, we had such a blast, it was great to see the guys again and I loved Quality Time with Karen...hey when she gets her talk show thats what she should name it   We kept talking about how we never thought we'd be at the point in our lives where itd be normal to drive an hour to see a show at a little bar, and that saying you hadn't seen a band in over two months would feel like such a long time.  "   We kept talking about how we never thought we'd be at the point in our lives where itd be normal to drive an hour to see a show at a little bar, and that saying you hadn't seen a band in over two months would feel like such a long time.   i absolutely love them and am so happy that i have impacted them in some sort of strangeness - we've come a long way...

      Yeehaw!!  Two of my bands playing together at one of the best places in DE - the Logan House.  The LH is always fun whatever the occasion may be.  We all love Ike and have embraced them within the past year.  I've been a fan of John's and whatever projects he has been involved in for years, so the development is always exciting.  :-)  Jen, Brittany, Tanya, and I all rode up together to the Logan House, freezing the entire way.  I had a tasty spiked beverage in the car, but I was hyper due to ecstaticness, not the Baileys.  A Swift truck followed us some of the way.  Good vibes.  We get there a little into Marlon Spike’s set, but in plenty of time to get our groove on.  Damn it was packed at the LH for still being so early.  We were all there, Pretty much like the Sugar Plum Fest, just this time at the Logan House.  The Justin Timberlake doll bobbled while Marlon Spike rocked.  Tanya and I both agree that their East End show was the best, but this comes in second place.  Todd’s energy blew him off the stage...ok,maybe not, but he got off stage with his sax and wandered around.  As Chris was announcing his love song and dedicating it to John (Faye of Ike), John saw me and hugged me and said hello during his honoring.  Funny.  Played a great set and followed it up with a 30 second bluegrass tribute to Ike.  Na na na na naa naaaa…  Damn I don't know who reads this, but I know that Brit and Jen do.....so telepathically fill in the blank here with all the stuff that was stupidly said or done.  Hints: movies and joeyness and crazy dedications.    Ike came on and exploded with our anthem - “Welcome Home”.  "We'll take all the good things like music, eating, and laughing and pass them down".  SIGH!  We rocked up front and danced all night long.  Brittany got inebriated and that was fun, Jen, Tanya, and I stayed sober.  The Logan House was full and the energy was awesome.  They played everything from old to album to new.    Chris was in high spirits and took a break from working the room to hang with us.  John saw him standing with us and told Chris that he just played his love song (Dandelion) and that it was dedicated to Chris.  So they threw the love back and forth and Chris told John that they just shared a moment.  The look on John’s face was great.  John then announced that that was the greatest unplanned segway in rock and roll because the next song was called “Just a Moment”.  Greatness!!  Towards the end of the first set, this guy tried to get on stage and jam out to Ike.  John told him to wait, so the guy had his bag and harmonica and played by the window.  He took Tanya’s space—damn him!  Ran into Michelle and Jason during the break, as well as someone I went to high school, and Beth  -  Eric’s (Aurora’s brother) girlfriend.  It was like a reunion.  So yeah, after the break, the LH had the random guy  -  later introduced as Bongo, on a mic on the side as he shook and rattled and banged away.  It was interesting.  I think he also made an appearance at the LDE show.   I swear, I have not seen a frontman jump around as much as John does.  Hopefully I got a decent action shot of it.  This was the band’s last performance until the spring.  They have side projects and John is having another baby this month, so a little time off is needed.  Took some pictures after, check their site soon because the DE girls will be representing on it.    So cold in the car.  We’re getting onto 95 and an ambulance passes in front of us.  We’re so frozen that all Jen can mutter is: “hehehe...ambulance...hehehe…incident…” and I nearly busted a gut.  A little background on why that comment was so damn funny  -  we all frequent the nearby wawa way too much and I find pleasure in checking out the sign posted on how many days that wawa has been “incident free”.  After Omnisoul and Ike played at the East End we had some time to kill before heading to Derek’s after party, so Aurora, Jen, and I went to Wawa where we saw an ambulance and my drunk ass freaked out wondering if it was there for an incident.  So yeah, ambulances equals incidents.  And FYI we went to Wawa that night and the Newark Wawa has been incident free for 16 days.   urlLink Pictures from the show are posted here under MS Jan 9 and Ike Jan 9   tough crap if you complain that this is a bite off of my road journal - deal with it :-)

      Whoa.  I just found the most perfect job posting.   About two years ago, Michelle and I were driving to Grape Street.  Which wouldn't have been anything odd, except we were going to see a new band, we both hadn't slept in days, and we both had papers due the next day that we hadn't started yet.  I remember it as clear as yesterday as we were going over the bridge that she could see me as being an A & R rep.  This was also during the time where I was determined to work in television news production.  And well now you see where I am and though I never forgot what Michelle said to me, I just figured that there were steps and distractions towards the process.  Such as if I ever win the lottery, I will open my own venue first.  Which sort of encompasses the beauty of the A & R aspect.    But yeah, during my neverending real job search - don't get me wrong, I love working at Rainbow and its great, but come on, I can't be doing this for YEARS, well, unless they give me the store haha - but yeah, I found an entry level A & R rep for the Northeast.  Granted I still have the grad school thing to go through, but hey, worth a shot.   urlLink I have had this link bookmarked for years, here is why i want to do it.   I won't put down the whole listing, but think I fit the reqs? Job Requirements: 1. Knowledge of regional/current music scene, required.  2. Strong presentation skills, both verbal and written, required.  3. Range of musical knowledge, required.  4. Knowledge of music retail, required.  5. Music retail experience, preferred.  6. Dependable automobile, valid driver’s license and proof of insurance, required.  7. PC Skills, Experience with word, excel and graphics programs, preferred.  8.

      Tuesday was an interesting day.  After putting off jury duty for two years, they finally nabbed me.  Not that I didn't want to do it, previous occasions found me in school, and right now it would just be a hassle.  So yeah, I woke up super early and drove into Wilmington.  Now, I would assume that if you are serving jury duty, you would want to at least put forth a good appearance.  Silly thought.  While sitting there in that room with 240 other people serving as a cross section of the county, it reaffirmed my thinking that I have to get the hell out of here.  Seriously now, who wears a freaking bright orange hunting jacket to court.  I glanced around the room and perhaps a handful looked professional.  And maybe I shouldn't pass judgement, but then again, you shouldn't look like you just stepped out of Walmart.  But hey, maybe that is the cross section here and I just haven't seen it yet since I spend my time around Main Street.  AUGH!   And the stupid questions!  The poor clerk, she explained things clearly and twice and still people had to ask things she already went over or were blantantly obvious.  It's not rocket science people!! And it wasn't even regarding procedures, it was regarding breaks, and lunch, and cell phones.  I hate to say it, but I wouldn't want some of those people chosing my fate.  But at least I was able to escape after a few hours and got the hell out of Delaware.  Picked up the *new* Phantom Planet CD and headed up to Morita's to pick up stuff and dinner.  I was there for New Years so I sort of remembered how to get there, but you know me.  I spilled coffee earlier that day, so it kinda smelled in my car so I had my windows down to have some circulation.  As soon as I went over the DE Memorial Bridge, the direction swooshed out of my car and into the Jersey air.  Why does this happen to me?!?!?  No fear, I remembered the roads, just couldn't remember left or right.  Ahhh...whatever.   Got there in a slightly different manner than anticipated.  We ordered chinese then I was off to Hoboken.    Akiva was playing at The Rodeo-Ristra headling an open mic and I wasn't doing anything else, so I figured I would check him out.  I heard of him through friends in Chicago who went me tunes and I immediately liked.  As Aurora says "I love finding new ones".  The open mic brimmed with so much talent it was awesome.  A great vibe to the place that reminded me of a cleaner, hipper, East End.  Or maybe I just spend way too much time at the East End.  Akiva & Dom played a sfew songs that impressed the corwd.  His presence remineded me of Phil's (Lloyd Dobler Effect) and his live music hinted at Matt Nathanson, Graham Colton, & G. Love.  So as you can see, I really enjoyed.  Oddly enough, a little bit ago after I posted his CD on my site as one to check out, he did a search and found my site and wrote me.  So very strange, but way cool, so I met him in Hoboken.  Very awesome guy and now its time to show the area whats up in music.  He graduated from UMASS Amherst with a degree in neurobiology, but a job fell through which prompted him to do the music thing full time.  I mentioned that he is still practicing in some way - his music has the power to heal. He paused and was like "that's the first time i ever heard that".  I am such a dork.  He introduced me to Marissa Levy who played a few people before him and announced that she was "going to play a few songs about lesbians".  She was super fly as well.    Left Hoboken shortly after midnight and seriously listened to Bueno y Sano two times all the way through.  Such an awesome awesome disc.  Also listened to a few tracks off of Marissa's CD, then XPN carried me the way home - who played Ryan Adam's "Hotel Chelsea Nights" - woohoo.  So the drive home was pretty quick and less than two hours.  And I always hate stopping at Jersey rest stops really late at night.  I'm used to the Maryland ones that always have people and look safe.  Why is the walk from the parking lot to inside the building so damn long?!  There is a reason you can't pump your own gas in NJ, they don't want you to get out of your damn cars!!!     All in all, a great way to spend my Tuesday. "Sometimes life gets somebody better.  You change your life and so goes the weather.  And any moment you could be back together.  Laughing Tuesday's gone..."

      Marlon Spike's Seventh Annual Sugar Plum Fest was held....exactly a week ago.  Damn this week went by quickly!  Fuck You Johnny Appleseeds  The Sugar Plum Fest is an annual gathering (my first) of good music, good people, and good cheer.  It’s a Marlon Spike & Friends tradition and performances are interspersed with socializing.  Or just another way for the posse to hang out and drink, but in a nicer setting.   It’s only like 15 of us, and MS played (without drums….why was Sark not there…?) and recorded at this private festive event.    So they played and Oliver had three drinks in hand, mine was empty.  I discovered a new drink with the available ingredients—lemonade.  But instead of water, use vodka, add that sugar lemon powder, and some sprite (SOME! Not a lot in usual Miranda fashion).  Oh yeah.  Best drink of the night.  Chris claims the best drink (aside from the Johnny Appleseeds…) was the Private Stock Captain on the rocks.  From behind the piano, he exclaims that it tastes like candy.  I beg to differ and I think that ended up on the recording, I hope not.  Took a break and drank.  So we’re around the table and Oliver finds the marmalade.   This was seriously the best minute of the party—it looked like it was from a scene from a movie.  I think Chris captured it on his camera, so hopefully he’ll circulate it. So yeah, shot of marmalade, then since that was gross I think he grabbed some meat, then that was even grosser so he needed a drink and the closest thing was the Jager, and well, that was just plain nasty and he found an apple and finished it off with a bite.  For some reason I thought there were more ingredients involved, but I dunno, I was pretty lit.  Elise and Oliver also challenge each other in pants rolling - Tanya got a picture of the momentous occasion.      Nick Shopa sang a few tunes, and played the acoustic, which rocked - he has an awesome voice.  The unOmnisoul crew comes.  Jamie and Derek were going to play with MS, but Derek was pretty damn sick, so Jamie comes and busts a move behind the keys.  Greatness.  He is so damn talented.  Then Marlon Spike comes on again and I leave to go into the kitchen and talk to Lex.  Break time and we all hang out in the kitchen.  Dan wandered back into the performance room and the sounds of Brand New permeated through the air.  Dan is singing my favorite Brand New song  so I jump into the room.  McDermott ends up next to me adn I find myself oddly fascinated with what I think was a cat toy.  I have no idea, I have problems.  But yeah, Jamie and Dan performing Brand New was great.  So Johnny Appleseeds.  It is a Marlon Spike original game that encompasses beverages and an apple.  The apple is cored with a bottom so that it is a shot glass.  The game is that everyone is around the table, you put whatever you want in the apple for the next person to take it.  The shot can be challenged and you would have to drink the shot if it is challenged, so the shots aren't totally heinous—but still pretty daring.  Luckily I am in between Lex and Elise so we try to be gentle to each other.  There were even sausage chasers.  Tanya said she has the best picture of me and my expression of my awful fruit filling.  I don’t even want to write what I had to drink because I think I may get sick.  But I will add that is never fun and games when Jager, and already chewed orange chaser, and horseradish gets busted out. I think the car ride was awful to all of us.  Fuck You Johnny Appleseed.  But all in all it was a festive evening full of good times.  I think Chris said it was a "perfect party".  Hopefully the recording came out well...

      ahhh yes, I am so loving these days.    I don't have work until Saturday night, live it up.  Yeah so tonights work day was fun, and ny fun i mean not fun.  Screw it, i am not talking about work on here.  So after work, I call Aurora and she comes over and we make drinks.  Woo.  And we talk on how some people have the audacity to be jackasses.  Yeah.  Then Krabill comes over and we head to Shawn's.  Shawn looks like a Tyler, so he is now named Tyler.  So we drink up there on Continental.  Survivor Flip Cup went underway and Derek held on his own and totally won. ON HIS OWN.  We schooled Jamie in some rap and then Matty Ry came in.  Ha....an STN wanderer at the Omnisoul party!  So then the keg turned out to be vinegar, no seriously, it was.  And we were scared that Derek may die, so we all leave to come back here.  Aurora, Jamie, Derek, Karbill, Matty Ry, and I all watched boobs on MTV when Derek wanted to go across the street and get a sandwich.  So we took a picture as he sprinted the ten feet.  He got there and realized he didn't have any money so he yelled into my window from the DD on where the ATM was.  It was rigth behind him.  Aurora said that the DD people prolly told him the sandwich was $25 since they saw how plastered he was.  It was awesome.  Come back here and play with pictures and watch tv and drink.  Derek told me that he emailed Phil (LDE) this morning and I told him that they were playing in DE tomorrow night.  What a silly small world.  I hope those two hook up.   So yeah we just watched some sports center and i am really tired.  Damn it is frigid outside.  At least Jamie and Krabill drove.  Ok, sleep time.  TOMORROW!!! I so need a Friday.  Tomorrow I am ditching out of work and heading up to Philly with Aurora.  We are meeting up with Maryellen and Chris M.  Hitting up some shops (Guacolmole!), then food, the PHANTOM PLANET at and instore on South Street THEN Jonathon Rice and Starsailor at TLA , THEN stopping by the Logan House...THEN initiating the guy into the LDE family and introducing the Omnisoul guys to the LDE crew and whoever else may be up and functioning in the wee hours of the morning.  Geez tomorrow is going to RULE.

      Like I stated before January has exhausted me up and down.  Though I sensed this was coming from being around, Javi's departure from Lloyd Dobler Effect was official.  This band is an awesome group of musicians and people.  They were my 22nd birthday present, and Aurora and I immediately started and continued a friendship with all of them.  I think the turning point in our relationship was on Feb 13 at the Millenium Music Conference 7 in Harrisburg...  [for a fulll account, hit up http://www.galileo358.blogspot.com/2003_02_16_galileo358_archive.html ]  Haha.  Man, such a great great great weekend.  We roll up to the Hilton (Kangol Black!) and as we are checking in the desk guy was trying to figure out where to put us.  He glances over at the other desk guy and they ask if they should "put them in that wing" , so Aurora and I wondered.  It was really great that when you sign up they ask you if you want to loud wings or the quiet wings.  So because the desk guys were worried on who we would be next to, we exclaim to put us in the room in question.  So we drag our things up to room 521.  We go to get our vehicle valeted so I call all of our friends who were there what room we were in.  I call up Phil and leave a message syaing we were in 521.  He calls back a few minutes later saying that they were in 520!!!  OH YEAH, one of the best weekends of 2003 and since the Hilton we have shared many adventures and long talks with these guys so its hard to see LDE become something different than what we have been familiar with.    But I totally understand that this is the time to either step it our or reevaluate.  The band is investing a lot of time and money in with Gary Katz and this new recording t be fun and that its time to take it to the next level.  And though we all like to drink and have fun and goof off, we must realize that to some, this is their lives and a job and can't always be fun and games.  I have listened to the studio tracks in the works and they are awesome.  I haven't really been fond of their other studio albums, I pride them in being a live band, but these new recordings make them shine and show their true talent.  I am also excited to see Chris Bruno in the band.  he used to be a part of Georgia Avenue, who I liked as well.  But they need a bassist...any takers?  Oh yeah, bassist...so recently after Javi announced his leaving, Rod did as well on the 19th.  At least we all get to hang out this weekend :-).  I swear....but no more band members leaving ok...? OK!?!??!    And the word loyalty has been tossed around...Loyal or not, this band is more than just a friendship, it is also a business and must find a way to work effeiciently and profitably.  2004 is the next level kids...  And this isn't me just jumping on a soap boax now, read my previous entries about LDE and you will see that I have been having a lot more faith in where they are taking this lately.    Its also weird, and Aurora and I have discussed this, that Javi is checking himself in.  We all enjoy the booze and hitting up the bottle on any given occasion and we have partied with Javi and lots of occassions.  This is just the first time that we have known anyone around our age that is going through this.  I'll share with you the Godinez sentiments...   "I want to clear up a few things for all the fans who have questions and I want all LDE fans and friends of mine to know the deal.  I am no longer a member of LDE. I was asked to leave after several attempts by the band and myself to clean up my party-lifestyle.  Don't think for a second that this decision is a load of crap and that it'sunjust to let me go from the band. The fact of the matter is that I have a drinking problem.  I continue to fuel this problem. I'm just owning up to things.  There were numerous times (at least 5-6) when the band sat together to discuss how I needed to improve certain things in my performance. Alcohol prevented me from seeing what I needed to do, and it is NO ONE ELSE'S responsibility to tell me how to do my job. That's the way life is, you have to take responsibility to better yourself as a person. I'm not blaming anyone or anything because the only person at fault is ME.  I'm sorry if I have let you (The Fans) down, but I promise that I will completely clean up my act. Music is still my passion and I have been workin daily (first time in 4 years) on everything musical (violin, guitar, bass, singing, and composing) that will help me out in the long run. As of right now, I do have the ambition of coming back to LDE, but only time will tell. I'm about to join a 28-day in-patient program to quit alcohol and because of that, I don't know what my attitude towards life will be when I am released. I do know that I will be a successful musician in one way or another. For now, I just have to get my life together, something that I never really have taken the time to do.  I hope that clears a lot of doubts, Lloyd-Heads. I definitely owe all of you who have supported us an explanation because you are an extension of the Lloyd Family. For now, just think of me as the drunken uncle who will come back a changed man. Keep supporting LDE.  Lots of love to the fans, to my ex-band mates, and to anyone that has supported the band in one-way or another.   Peace,   Javi"  ------  This is Rod talking to you, the fans. I would like to say thanks for all the great nights and the undying support and love you have shown for LDE. As Phil mentioned, I gave my two weeks notice on Monday, January 19th 2004 at 1:30 P.M. The past few months there have been changes made in the band and the sound has changed. This was all made to make the band sound full, but it also stirred the band in a different direction-- one that I can't relate to. This is not to say that LDE is a bad band or that they're not going places. To the contrary, I have 100% faith that LDE will be great and is going to accomplish great things in 2004 and beyond. As much as I would like to be a part of this success, fame and glory, I just didn't feel this was the way for me. Having struggled with this decision for over the past month, I finally decided to leave the band and do it my own way, rather than be a pain in the ass to the rest of the guys and be unhappy. Some day in the near future, I will see the guys of LDE at the Grammys-- that's a promise!! Until then, I wish LDE much success... and to the fans... you'll hear from me... soon... and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the great times, support, love, and most of all... thank you for your friendship. Oh, and please continue to support the rest of the guys in LDE, because they totally rock!!! --------------- And from Phil...  It was Rod, LDE's bass player and my long-time friend. He walked into the room and told me that he can't play with the band anymore. Dazed and half asleep, I immediately woke up. I asked why and he said that he feels that he has to persue other interests and he feels that LDE is going in a direction that no longer involves him. I wished him the best and he was on his way.   Over the past couple of months, LDE has changed our sound somewhat. This is a direction that the rest of the band is eager to head in. We are very happy with the way our new recording is going as well as the way the new and final line up of LDE is shaping up. We are constantly thinking about our live show and being able to deliver the best to you, our incredible fans. However, we are also consistantly trying to recreate our music and write new music so that our live show is not the same every night of the week. We feel that this is very important to the band and the fans.   I know in my heart that in a month or two, LDE will be the best it has ever been. We will continue to give 200% at our performances and we will continue to evolve. The new CD, when it is completed, will be the best recording I have ever been lucky enough to be a part of. I feel blessed to have an amazing drummer (Donnie), a show-stopping percussionist (Rusty), a soulful and out-of-wack saxophonist (Doug) and an incredible guitarist/vocalist/songwriter (Chris) in my band. This LDE is the first time I have ever felt absolutly incredible on stage and I promise this will bloom into something 100x better than it is now.   The only thing that gets me is the "my band" instead of "our band"...I have the utmost respect and admiration for Phil and his talents, so undeniably he is going to shine, but still, there is no I in team...(but there is a me!)  So I don't know how to take that statement, but I still fully support the guys and LDE (and the Godinez brothers) in whatever may come

      Heavy.  Earlier today I realized what the date was and I can't believe we are only three weeks into the new year and how amazingly tumultuous January has become.  I don't mean that in the positive or the negative, perhaps a bit of both but it has come to the point where I am frightened to sleep at night because I don't know what the day brings.  So much has happened recently, with myself and my relations with people around me and just turn of events, which I am really excited for, but seriously, give me a break once in a while!!  I started off the streak by being completely honest and ballsy from the new year till now I strengthened relationships, travelled, made life altering decisions, had familiarity crumble before me, and realized I am stronger than I thought possible, but weaker than ever...  Onto my days events...  Started the day off with an early morning horseback ride and it was freaking cold.  I swear I thought I was going to lose my apendages because it was so damn cold.  Came back and went straight to the radio station... Chris R. has a radio show pertaining to local arts stuff and had me on as a guest today regarding the local rock scene.  So of course I plugged Ike, Omnisoul, and Marlon Spike and we played their songs and talked about their shows and just the local rock atmosphere around here.  We had callers, it flew by and was enjoyable.  Afterwards I worked with Dave on some music production in protools and it was saucy.    I come back to my apartment with some unsettling Lloyd Dobler Effect news.  I will touch on this whole subject in tomorrows blog (regarding the LDE changes) but can touch on it now.  Rod, the bassist, announced he was leaving the band.  This transcends so much beyond the music.  Come on, who is going to bring us warm PBR outside the Grape?!  No, but seriously, I welcome change and I understand it, but it still doesn't make it easier to say goodbye.  Not after all the craziness that has been endured with the Godinez brothers.  And after talking with Phil on several occasions, I am still fully behind LDE and its alterations, it is just the instability of somethng so familiar that is upsetting, but will be brought up in another blog...  So yeah, didn't expect that...this isn't cool right before the Japan & New England tour!!  They'll be in DE this weekend, so now the party is really going down.  Spent the afternoon talking with Maryellen and Chris M. via email while they procrastinated at work ;-).  I'm glad there are others as insanely connected to their computer as I am.  Makes me feel better about my addiction.  While talking with them, I realize that I think I definitely have a ghost of some sort in here.  When I first moved it I would feel a presence and see a smoke haze, but not a definite figure.  And today the smokey haze was chilling in my plant.  I felt a sense of calmness, so I feel OK.  But now I guess I shouldn't dance around my room naked.  Just kidding folks...  My internet died so I went to the store to say hi to Chris C. and to get my mail.  As I am laughing at my insanely high credit card bill (i have come to the realization that i will always be in debt and will always have to pay a bill of some sort, so why the hell not just spend away) Chris informs me that we were burglarized again.  As he is breaking the news to me, Rusty from LDE is calling me.  I CAN'T TAKE THIS!!!!  So I am laughing my ass off because there is just simply nothing much more to do.  I look at Chris and apologize, and start laughing again.  Hell, if you can't explain it and you're a rain cloud, the least you can do is laugh.  Why why why why, these is all so boggling because it doesn't make sense - nothing fits.  I seriously feel like a target, and I am not just talking about the robbery...I am just way on edge on a few things that can't even be mentioned on here.  And the fact that I can't mention them on here says a lot...but I think I can honestly say that I haven't ever been more fearful.  Tanya, Joe, Chris L. (yes, that is four Chris's mentioned in one blog, I oughta through another one in for fun), Dan, Todd, Sark, & I went to McGlynn's for some merriment before the Omnisoul show.  Poor Casey Kasem was left defenseless against the ridicule against him.  For God's sake, his hair looks like steel wool.  Maryellen made me laugh at the table because she texted me about a Damien Rice song being on a TV show.  We are such dorks I love it.  It reminded me of the time that Nate called me from Cali to have me listen to a song that was playing in the pool hall.  We left there without Todd and Sark and with Ben and headed to Kahuna.  Met up with Aurora, David, Cooksy, and crew and hung out.  Great show by the guys as they played some new stuff, but the sound wasn't as good as other venues, but the effect was still there.  And Jamie wails on Bohemian Rhapsody.  Aurora and I screamed way loud and were annoying.  Oh well.  Chris had on saucy cashmere socks that were fuzzy.  I'll write more on the show under the show review section.    Ever feel like you thought you knew someone, and then they completely change due to the people they are around?  Yeah me too, thanks.    Chris Bruno....um....welcome to LDE and brace yourself for Friday...I just wanted to throw another Chris in there for five.  Goodnight all, wonder what tomorrow will bring.

      I decided to let Melissa write this blog...because.....she already told her neighbors she was an alcoholic. I really do think we have problems.  No, seriously.  We are alcoholics.  Its a freaking Tuesday nighT and so far, 2 bottles of wine gone....between the two of us.  We're watching American Idol and laughing at those stupid chumps.  Oh but lets go back to her nasty neighbors.  She opens the door with a beer in her hand and they say that drinking is always her excuse for not ever moving her car.  and so she points to her beer and says DRINKY!  After she slams the door on the rude woman's face, she claims that she is an alcoholic and we drink to that.  At that time, it was only 7:30.  We then drink to everytime someone does somehting stupid on American Idol....so yeah, we're pretty plastered because if you saw tonights show, you wold realize how untalented all these ass clowns are.  Oh yeah, rick was sleeping and he heard melissa yelling at her neighbors so he came downstairs awoken from his slumber to set them in place.  we are still waiting for those cops to come that they treatened us with.  So rick joined us in some merriment.  Melissa says i am a bad person cuz i make her do things that she would not normally do.  i am a bad influence.  the bad seed.  i can't feel my toes.  i went into melissa's work on wednesday before heading out to nyc with aurora and can't recall anyone, but apparently i made a strong enough impression that russell called aurora miranda.  he called aurora by my name that should mean.  yeah, melissa just mentioned that.  and melissa just admired my swift typing skills and how i have made minimal mistakes while typing inebriated.  but then again when i IM people, every other word is misspelled  because because because because because.  Because of the wonderful things he does - do do do dodo.  hahahahhahaahahhahahah  HAHAHHA so two wednesday ago, we were over here - when melissa thought she could never drink again and we all emptied out her liquor cabininent - and melissa kept saying the word "drrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrruuuuuuuuuuuuuunk" and it was really funny and we still laugh.  and we just realize that we refer to people as their IM names as opposed to their real names.    So what's everyone doing for the superbowl - YEAHHAHHSHHASHASH PATRIOTS! "NO PANTHERS" says Melissa shrilly.  We're going to have that jello wrestling tournament then too, since apparently we're on opposite sides now.  Ohhh i can't feel my face. Oh, what else can we wrestle in?  Sour cream dip?  Salsa?  Guacomole?  It will be a nacho dip of sorts.  Rick has now come into the room/.. They are yelling at me.  Someone help.  THey are drunk and loud, and I fear for my safety... that was rick, he just left to get a drink to deal with us.

      Alright kids, it's go time.  The NYU application will be dropped in the mail tomorrow.  Eeeeek!    I wanted to get it in a lot sooner than this - it is due Feb 1, but I am picking up my last recommendation tomorrow.  I had to get two recommendations, but opted for three because its a strong number - the strongest most complete number since a plane will fit on any three points in space.  Actually, that is another reason I am dropping off my application tomorrow, because it is Jan 20, which is a three day.  One plus two plus zero, years don't count.  And 21 days of every month is a celebration and though I opted to have my package postmarked on the 21st, I figure I will have it postmarked on the three day, and en route on the 21 day.  Double the luck.  But yeah, so I chose 3.  Hopefully NYU will dig them.  I got Steve to do one as a band rec, the station manager of WVUD, and Chris because she has known all of my work with STN and has seen the transformation of my show.  So hopefully that will encompass it all.    Tweaking my personal statement now.  Its not how I want it, but its all I can fit into three pages.  Again, the magic number is three.  I feel as though grad school is my only option right now.  I've spent the last seven months applying to jobs to no avail.  And its not like I am not qualified, in either the music realm or what I actually went to college for (double majored in mass communication (the media aspect) and political science) and there are just no jobs.  And granted I love every day, I just can't keep doing what I do because I am broke.  Flat ass broke.    I looked into grad school a few months ago due to my desparity and while searching for close schools and looking into the business or political aspect, it dawned on me that i should study something i want to do, not what is available.  So there are a few schools in the US that offer a post grad degree in music business and i narrowed it down to TN and NYU.  No way in hell I am going to TN, and I find every excuse to go into NYC, so NYU is going to be getting my only grad school application.  So I am really nervous because it is really tough to get in.  Extremely tough.  Super duper freaking hard as hell tough to get in.  But what do I have to lose, right?    If I do get in, I am going, no matter what.  I am fortunate enough to not have any college loans due to scholarships that equated more than a full ride.  So why not go into deeper debt?  At least I will have another piece of paper to show for it.  Haha, I have no idea where my degree is.  I do know where my graduation cap is.  Karen, Natalie, and I decorated them the night before graduation with strings of wired stars and puffy glitter paints.  Mine said "tempted...fated...looks like we finally made it..." And of course it was a Pat McGee Band quote.  Time will tell.  So I am sitting here with my Wawa coffee - geez, it feels like college again - I am writing and finishing this essay until the wee hours of the morning.  And by the way, the Wawa has been incident free for 5 days.    Chris made my stereo work finally, hmmm...not supposed to jam the wires in...?  So now I can listen to CDs in my room.  The following discs are currently playing and will follow me till the end of the writing: Ryan Adams - Rock N Roll (i love this disc almost more than my roos) Jeff Buckley - Live at Sin-e' (disc 1) Green to Think - The Miranda Sessions (rock on)

      Haha....someone just called the store... "hi, i'm looking for this really obscure band, maybe you can help me out..."  and incidently its the band that Melissa and I have tattoos of.  Ohhhh dangling preposition.  In the store, we are currently listening to Eric Clapton & BB King, Sheryl Crow, Tom Petty, David Bowie, and Albert King.  Good stuff, but...yeah....  "Here's the thing. I made that tape special for today. My special Monday morning tape for YOU... SPECIAL!" - Barry, from High Fidelity

      I must start out this entry by celebrating the fact that Ames shot his 200th 3 pointer last night and UD Men's Basketball topped ODU.  Aurora and I listened to the end of the game on WVUD while driving to Baltimore and we freaking out when Ames' 200th shot with 1.8 seconds left in the game won it for them.  We screamed and beeped then put in some Graham Colton.  We battled the snow and ice and stupid drivers on 95 and arrived at the Funk Box shortly after LDE took the stage.  We ran late because I got out of work later than expected and the weather sucked.  Chris, the new guy - or i mean, "the guy", had to get our approval, and well, he immediately got it.  Damn, I don't think we can take it.  So yeah, we danced and sang and made fun of the crazy girl dancing in front of us.  I don't think this chick had a spine because her body was flailing about all over the place.  It got to the point that guys would run up and dance with her just to say they did and people covertly took pictures of her antics, it was great.    I got to hear "Meet Me in London", I was afraid we'd miss it, which is one of their new songs, and my favorite of the new ones out there.  I can't even tell you how good this album is going to be.  It was so weird to not see Javi on stage, but even worse when LDE played Rabies, which is the song where Javi goes nuts in with his dog hat.   But the guys were on it at the Funk Box, though there was some sound difficulties.  And Chris definitely fit right in.  It will be interesting to see where they will be going with this new sound as they try to make 2004 their year.  There are lots of surprises waiting... :-)  After the show, Rusty took us upstairs to the best green room on the east coast.  I just love the Funk Box.  Seriously, if you are a band, play there.  Now.  So we sat around and talked I guess.  We definitely didn't drink.  It was really chill.  Ran around the venue sliding down banisters and jumping over baricades playing a game of hide and seek.  The guys will be leaving soon to head out on tour in Japan.  I was chosen over Chuck to go, sorry :-P.  LDE, Brad, and I will make sure Asia treats them well.  Haha, if only I could leave Delaware and the USA for a month, but damn I can't.  Unless...  But the LDE New England tour is coming up and that should be like the craziness of MMC7 times 80 million.  The last week in March will bring us to Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, a detour in New Hampshire, and New Jersey on the way back.  Booya.

      Friday's WVUD show was awesome.  Derek joined me for the two hours as we invaded the airwaves with Omnisoul.  This is going to be a good year for them, its been way too long.  It was funny because Derek and I started talking on air and I was befuddled because he answered five of my questions all in one breath.  What can I do, it's not his fault.  He said "Miranda, you know me, I'm a talker".  It was hilarious.    So we promoted their Deer Park show and Derek played some acoustic tunes in the air studio.  We had lots of callers and some radio colleagues of mine spoke highly of the show afterwards, so yay!  It was also funny, during one of his answers, he's like, "you know all this!".  That's always a little bump in interviewing people you know well haha.  But of course, that makes the best interviews as well.  :::cough cough cough:::  (that could go for several in 2003)  But yeah, Omnisoul will be rocking the Deer Park, and I will be there after work.  Then who knows where after.

      I swear I am a freaking idiot.  Don't ever wash your burgandy sweater with your black sweaters because your black sweaters will emerge with burgandy balls of fuzziness all over them.  ALL OVER THEM!  I will deal with them and my lint brush in the morning.  Seriously now, I've washed them together before and they got along nicely before.  :-/  If anyone ever wants to buy me anything - aside from getting my dumpster dent out of my car, my car payments, my never ending credit card debt due to gas and concert tickets, my hopefully upcoming grad school debt, or even health insurance, health insurance would be fun to have - you can buy me black long sleeved shirts because i wear them more than anything else and apparently i can't take care of them.

      Shmooper Bowl is this Sunday.  Woohoo, I am rooting for the Pats.  HAHHAHA.  So the past few years the Super Bowl festivities were always held at my old apartment.  And I absolutely love this story, one of the highlights of last year.   So of course, jello shots were the snack of choice anytime any gathering was had at 5208 (super secret special recipe) and so we had the fun idea of taking a shot everytime the team we were rooting for screwed up.  Yeah well, I was cheering on the Raiders and if you noted Rich Gannon's performance you will realize that I was plastered.  We made a ton of shots and we had a ton of food.  This detail will come in handy later.  After the game, Dave (Karen's ex) came over with a friend and Jesse stopped by.  The five of us were hanging out in the dining room with 5 jello shots left on the table.  We figured we ought to finish them off, but karen tells us she can't - that she is too full from jello and junk food.  So of course Dave and I get into this rant on how there is always room for jello and i think Dave even busted out the cosby voice.  Regardless, we convince her to take it.   And well, sometimes there ISN'T enough room for jello.  :-)  She knows we love her hehe.  I swear we are all only here to provide amusement to others, but still one of my favorite stories of 5208, and trust me, we have plenty.  The year before that we heard bitching and whining the whole time because someone had to student teach the next day.  Oh THAT was enjoyable.  Wonder what this years super bowl will bring.

      So I recently discovered why a close friend of mine was acting pretty strange lately and now I feel awful that I took it personally and it had nothing to do with me at all.  I wish I could have been more involved.  But everything makes sense and the world is now right.  Reminds me of a Forever Moon lyric...  It's bigger than you It's bigger than me It's bigger than anything, that it started out to be  (which also made me think of Brittany who will be back in Newark in a little over a week.  As with everyone else, aw yeah.)

      Sheets of ice and fluttering snowflakes covered the Delaware region causing the Grape Street to cancel their concert festivities for the evening.  Marlon Spike was a featured artist for the Y100 Tuesday Night Music Club and we had the caravans all ready for a night of good music and good times.  So instead, we headed over to the Omniapartment for a variance of our expected nights activity.  Derek and Jamie live within walking distance, so after Aurora and I contemplated on whether to walk or drive thru the tundra, we opted for driving, and the park job in the snow bank was fantastic.  We came armed with Raspberry vodka and Sprite.  It was funny that when I put it on the table, Chris and Dan said that they got the same thing because, well, because that's how we do...  We listen to the Omnisoul edition of the SPF VII, which included the Jamie Orlando sessions and the Marlon Spike take on The Greater You (Omnisoul song).  It was so damn great - we laughed and cried.  Shortly after the boys - Chris, Derek, Dan, & Jamie - pick up an assortment of instruments and start playing away.  The Chris and Derek rendition of The Greater You was awesome.  We also talk about how we are displacing the DE music scene and taking it to NYC.  Yoink!  Chris informed me of his hemi-blindness and his allergies and though I feel his pain, he does not beleive I do.  The conversation turned to drinking a lot and getting sick when Tanya mentioned how brutal last weekend was to her.   Aurora and I were just talking about how we were alcoholic bulimics.  Or beer bulimics...there was a term used.  I told Tanya that she hasn't been sick from drinking until she utters the words "i'm never drinking again".  And that was the synopsis of the others.  Which I guess isn't a good thing to strive for, but ehhh that's how we do.  And she brought great stuff that rivals the honey liquor.  I am not even going to try to spell it, but its from South Africa and it is tasty on ice.  The girl knows her booze ;-).  Derek inquired about going to the diner.  We all know that if we drink at the Omniapartment, we make a stop at the diner across the street.  Derek also informed us that he only goes when we're all there hahaha.  While Chris was dabbling with the synthesizer, Dan said we need a reason to come back to drink some more afterwards, and though we didn't come up with one, we headed out anyways.  Somehow swearing came up and Chris never swears, unless he is drunk.  And yeah, he was drunk and it was humorous.  Aurora and Derek went out to smoke while we were bundling up and greeted us with snowballs.  I think I missed Chris by a longshot but we ended up drenching each other in snow by the time we got to the diner.  Tanya put snow down Dan's back and that was just mean ;-).  I mean not mean...just chilling.  We were the only ones at the diner and had a super cool waitress.  Dan bought a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon - since there was no us going to the Grape Street, he brought the Grape Street to us - and brought two PBR's for us to consume at the diner.  So we sit down and Chris starts off the conversation (and the best quote in a while):  chris: Does anyone else think the ozone layer is a wuss?  It's a big pussy. tanya: I don't like that word chris: Neither does the ozone layer.  So damn funny.  I don't remember much more from the diner.  Oh, I do remember Chris giving me a lesson on his snazzy new flash for his camera.  And that the lens cover was ok to break instead of the lens because the lens cover was "not that many dollars" and the camera itself was "much more many dollars".    We come back and not really sure what we do.  The Dewey Beach Music Conference came up.  This April is going to be more insane than it usually is.  Seriously.  We sang Biz Markie again.  Jamie didn't know that one either.  We're going to have to teach him the ways of the classic hip hop.  Once Chris and Derek pass out we figured it was time to call it a night.

      I guess I haven't changed much since the 8th grade.    My old guidance counselor of sorts from the Bedford days stopped in the store today to buy the new Yes DVD.  He looked at me and told me he knew me and recalled my name.  I had to be prompted, because unlike myself, he had changed over the years, looking more like a hippie rocker than the man I knew in the suit behind a desk.   Do I seriously still look like I am thirteen, haha?  And its still very cool he remembered who I am a decade later.

      During the middle of the night - or I guess 7:33 am is early morning for some, I felt my neighbor come into my room, say my name, and shake me telling me that we have the get out of here.  She kept shaking me harder because I wouldn't wake.  So I open my eyes, and no one is there.  Scariest feelirng.  And of course it took me about an hour to get back to sleep since I was freaked and I heard the continuous scrape of the shovels on the sidewalks below.  If you had to leave, what would you take with you?  Glancing around, I see that there is nothing that I would really need to go on.  So I guess I would grab my laptop, CD books, camera, and box of musical goodness over the years (the PMB bongo top, various laminants, pictures, etc).  All those can be easily grabbed out the door.

      I am watching the Maryland - Clemson basketball game and it made me think of U of DE basketball and how much I miss it.  My past three winters were spent either shooting the games under the nets or up top or in the stands waving those silly balloons and in any situation having a blast.  Man I miss Fisher.

      Right now I am listening to the new Starsailor, The Postal Service, and Johnathan Rice on random and I don't think I can take such brilliance.    And the snow is falling outside, I wish I had a digital camera so I could share it with you right now.  I absolutely love the snow.  Last I heard, we are expected to get 6-8 inches, woohoo!  I am such a gross and nasty person.  I have had these eggs in my fridge since August and just now threw them out.  So gross.  I am not that crafty in the kitchen so I have a tendency to forget about things in my fridge until it gross fur.  Ew grossest story ever... during my soph year in college my mom brought me spaghetti in a platic container in the fall.  When I was moving out I discovered a container full of black stuff.  I had no idea what it was until I opened it and saw crustified black spaghetti.  The smell was atrocious and I nearly threw up.  Yeah, I'm gross.

      After partying late and sleeping not enough, Aurora and I were groggy beginning our Friday. At our customary Wawa stop for coffee - our stomachs DID NOT want anything else in it, but we needed the caffeine to actually function - we ponder why this is our lives.  We wonder what it would be like to have 9-5pm jobs, come home to eat dinner, then watch TV till ten.  Then we laugh and smile because we're too tired and sick to formulate words.  On of the many good things about the drive to Philly is that the trip is short enough that we can just play our favorite tracks on the CD player.  I don't think we said anything on the way there because any sort of movement beyond my VERY safe and careful driving may make us throw up.  We get to the parking lot and head off in the cold to South Street.  After our disappointing stop at Guacomole, I call Maryellen to see where she is.  Oddly enough, Lisa and she were parking their car right in front of us.  We go to meet Chris in front of the TLA and run into him at a different intersection.  Convenient.  We grab dinner at Copabanana and hit the used CD store because it was way too frigid to be walking outside.  Phantom Planet was playing an in-store at Tower, and I thought it was the South Street Tower.  I was wrong.  But that's ok because we spent that hour at the listening booths and Maryellen smartly bought Elefant and Earlimart.  We ducked into Manny Browns for happy hour to talk and pass the time and Chris and Maryellen owned the jukebox.  Aurora and I headed out to the TLA because I am a big dork and want to be up close for Johnathan Rice and Starsailor, woohoo!  Johnathan was great.  I heard his EP at the radio station a few months ago, but hadn't had the opportunity to see him live yet.  Such an awesome lyricist.  I highly recommend him.  There was cute beanie man to our left and overbearing big guy that kept inching over to Aurora and stupid PDA couple who kept touching me to the left of me.  I wondered if people look at us and says "whoa, check out those scarf girls" and spy on us the whole night.  After the longest break ever between sets - where Morita, Aurora, and I complained very loudly and obnoxiously - Starsailor finally came on.  I almost forgot how awesome they are.  So incredibly great.  Their live show is phenomal.  If you couldn't tell by my lack of words, I was nearly speechless.  Their new material was fantastic.  Unfortunately, Aurora and I had to head out of the show a little early to meet up with LDE in Delaware.  So here we are contemplating on when we should actually leave, the whole time having James stare at us for most of the freaking show bypassing the girls in front of us.  Maybe he could read lips I don't know.  So here we are saying, ok, one more song, we'll leave after one more song.  Then James says for the crowd to sing, stares at Aurora and I and puts the mic to us.    I was born again I was born again Not into the world they put me in She was born again she was born again Not into the world they put her in  "What a f-ing kick in the balls" says Aurora.  Yup, that pretty much sums it up.  Why are we us?  Why do we have to make the choice on leaving one show to meet up with other band friends.  WHY?!?!?!?!?!?!  Also, why does it start snowing anytime we drive home from a major city?  New York City last Wednesday, Baltimore on Friday, and now Philly.  WTF.  I think we curse the weather gods and they spite us by making it heavily snow during our travels.  We search for a Wawa in Wilmington, A+ just doesn't cut it, and meet the LDE boys outside of the Logan House, where we proceeded to play Graham Colton very loudly and though snowballs and write things on their van in the snow.  Help them load up the van and shoot the breeze whole Phil informs me of all the area bands that broke up recently.  We drove back to Newark going 30 MPH in the snow awaiting the guy driven van and trailor to actually catch up.     Some of us laugh, some us cry Some of us smoke, some of us lie But it's all just a way that we cope with our lives  ~ starsailor

      Ok, I don't know the Justin Timberlake lyrics, but I think that is right.  SO DAMN FUNNY.  Thank you Morgan for sending me this: http://www.morgasmic.org/images/janetboob.jpg  We held the Super Bowl festivities at Melissa's this year.  The first half of the game blew and the commercials weren't that much better.  But Karen and I drank 6 bottles of wine I think.  Tequila and Jager shots were taken.  We tore into pink elephants.  The half time show sucked worse than the first half.  What was it, 1999?  Janet Jackson and P. Diddy and Kid Rock's 4 year old single?!  But Melissa caught Janet's exposure and it was great.  Rick has a mini keg thingy so I said something about a keg stand on it.  Oh and we did, oh we did.  I can't beleive we did, but that was also entertaining.    Melissa and I were the only ones yelling at the TV I think.  Her for the Panthers and me for the Patriots.  And we know who prevailed, it was awesome.  Karen and I have a tendency to play airplane when we are together, so we tried.  Operative word being tried.  For two years we have been planning a jello wrestling tournament, but something always gets in the way.  That was mentioned when Chris came, and so we decided on snow wrestling, though it was just us playing in the snow.  I hope we didn't scare him.  Jello wrestling will happen at some point.  Perhaps the rooftop in the spring...?  We go back in and watch Super Troopers which wasn't that Super.  Neither was the bowl.  Pictures will be up shortly and I am sorry I am lacking the detail, perhaps Melis and Karen can fill me in because I am way too tired to think right now.

      Omnisoul rocked the Deer Park on Saturday night showing Newark how to do original music.  Screw you DJs and cover bands, good original music can pack a house.  After work Aurora and I went to DP to get some nachos and drinks and tried to get her in.  Instead, once Tanya, Heidy, Amy, and Andres showed up, she left for Tyler's for Jackman's going away shindig.  She figured we would all be hanging out afterwards anyways, that she wil just come back for that.  We go upstairs and meet up with Chris and Dan as Omnisoul started their set.  They dedicated "You Say" for Oliver, though he wasn't there.  I'll save the full on show review for the Road page of my website.    Chris coerced us to stand in front of the stage and we did, and there were followerers.  Tanya reveled in her free beer and gave her seductive look to all she twirled with and it was fabulous.  McDermott and Nick showed up shortly into Omnisoul's set as well.  I met the infamous Matt who called into WVUD on Friday.  Jamie busted out some O-Town and people swooned.    During the set break Jamie schooled me in his religion and I came away from that conversation more educated than before on a subject I knew nothing about.  Derek came back on stage and asked the crowd if anyone else beside him had too much to drink during the break.  Speaking of quotes, he had also said "if anyone wants to buy us a drink, we're game".  Tanya's roommate Heidy thought he said "if anyone wants to buy us a drink, we're gay".  HILARIOUS.  They tore into Paranoid Android and it was great.  Derek also played solo This Love and grabbed himself, which I heard caused later problems.  We agree that "The Greater You" is phenomenal as we sing along.  The crowd got crazy for "Waiting" and it was awesome.  The energy in the corwd at this point was amazing.  I've known Derek for a while as his music has developed and it made  me  happy to see such excitment and singing along, so I could only imagine how it was from onstage.  Right after they ended, Aurora pulled up so we went back to my place and hung out with my neighbors for a bit before heading over to Chapel.  The PBR from Tuesday was consumed as we played with magnetic fridge poetry.  Oh great fun and such a dangerous combination.  We sang Biz Markie again.  Yes, again.  Derek was trashed and it was funny.  We all had decided that after Tanya and Dan played beer pong, that we would go to the diner...because that's what we do.  We tell Derek that we will be going, but instead he wants to go home but its a long and cold walk.  He inquired who was driving and we had three cars to go to the diner.  He gave Chris the puppy dog eyes as he asked if he could get a ride home.  Someone mentioned Jamie and um, someone else - no idea who, blocked Jamie so that Derek wouldn't see him and ask.  I don't know, it was much funnier at 4am.  Regardless, we go to the Eagle.  We got our same kickass waitress as last time and she wasn't mad at the PBR cans we left on the table on Tuesday.  She had a good memory and was able to recall some of our usual order, including the side of miscellaneous sauce.  Aurora and I played "name that band" with Dan's iPod inventory.  Jamie just started a job last week and he was telling us how he dozes off at work, but stares at paper and switches the paper so it looks like he is actually doing something.  Chris informs him that it will only get worse, and he has only been on the job for two days.  Jamie says he actually doesn't mind his cubicle, in which Chris replied with how the cubicle will be welcoming and comfortable, like a womb, in the beginning, but will then become like a prison.  Any more quotes from the table...?  I think we kept it PG this time!  After the disco fries were torn up, the two sides of miscellaneous sauce were kicked, and Jamie made a mess out of his butter, we called it a night.  Aurora said it was 5:12 am and that meant it was time to go.  5 am is the magic number.

      I joined Jamie going to the Grape Street to see Mr. North.  I know he really likes the band, so i figured they must be good and are worth checking out.  He picks me up and we go to the customary Wawa stop where I school him in my extensive Wawa knowledge including the southern  most and northernmost Wawa's along with their strengths and weaknesses and injury reports.  I may have frightened him a little :-).  I also informed him of the delectable sweet cream stuffed pretzel treat, which he tried and enjoyed.  We got our sustenence and headed up to Manayunk.    Jamie found the Jelousy Curve guys and we hung out with them most of the night before Mr. North came out.  The guys said how amazing and rockstar the lead singer was. I found this amusing, then Jamie proceeded to tell me to not be scared, but in a few minutes he will be singing along with Mr. North like a little girl. The JC guys also said that if someone whipped out a gaydar, it would blip a little bit more due to all of the guys in the audience feeling slightly homoerotic during the performance.   But damn, the performance was awesome and they were so right.  And oddly enough, there was a gang of underagers at the Grape for this show, but by the end of the show, they were gone.  Hmmm.  But yeah, Mr. North knew how to rock.  Hard.  Yeah!

      Work all day on MOnday, followed by Quizzo.  Chris and Dan were wandering around Newark promoting the Ground Floor show and stopped in Rainbow to ease our insanity.    We lost at Quizzo though we rocked most of the questions.  Unfortunately we were banished to the bottom floor instead of joining the excitement of the 2nd floor, but that's what happens when we're late. :-(     As Dan and I were walking back to my place, I saw a car swerve out from a side street and collide into a telephone pole.  Dan called 911 and we walked over there.  The girl wasn't trapped or bleeding, which was fortunate, just disillusioned.  I had my windows open in my apartment and shortly after I got in I could hear the scraping of metal from the pole.  It was gross.

      After going to bed around 4ish after the show, I woke up a little after 9 to hit the gym and run some errands before heading out to Hoboken.  Wanted to hit the road by 3, but of course I always run late.  I stopped over Chris's to pick up some goods and to accidently leave my gloves before heading north and of course that meant a quick jaunt to Wawa.  Their new Chocolate Peanut Butter Cappucino is amazing.  More on Wawa later.    The trip took about two hours, not counting the half hour I took in Hoboken trying to find parking.  Hung out with Maryellen for a bit as we talk about guys and compare pictures.  She lives a block away from Maxwell's which is perfect.  I want to live walking distance to an awesome venue!  We grab a few drinks and I eat my frist real meal of the day while I spill to maryellen to latest predicament I have found myself in and why certain people in my life weren't who I thought they were.  So of course she was encouraging.  :-)  During our conversation we saw Steve drive past numerous times in search of a spot, which was hilarious she was able to spot his SUV, but it was all because of the ubiquitous GTT sticker.    Steve, Ken, and Jodie made it to Maxwell's and we chatted with them for a bit.  Well, Maryellen talked and Steve jabbed me and asked me why I was being so quiet.  I didn't think I was unusually quiet, but apparently I was, perhaps it was the lack of sleep and the miles on the road.  We watched the Grammy's on mute.  Steve yelled at me for what I play on the radio.  Ok, he didn't yell, but he was not happy.  Hey, I have to keep him on his toes!  The best part of the evening was the entirely weird conversation at the table that pertained to manbags, hair straighteners, and H&M!  I have to protect the not so innocent!    Steve, Ken, Melissa, Rick, and I saw OK Go a little less than a year ago in Lancaster, so it was cool to check out the band again with Ken and Steve.  We nudged our way closer to the stage in the sea of mixed people.  In this town, the corwd was not entirely compromised of teenage girls.  They started with "Don't Ask Me" then "There's a Fire", which was the same as the first two songs in Philly and NYC.  So of course since I texted the Philly setlist, I retrieved it and we watched as the Hoboken setlist dictated the same setlist as a few nights ago.  Even the witty banter was similiar.  Granted, the show was still great, but it was like a rerun.  Steve made fun of me again for the setlists.  Do you notice a trend?  Meanie.  Just kidding.  There were some crazy people dancing near us and Steve asked me if I could pick out the 30 year olds  We were both staring at the same guy.  I then got back at him by mentioning how he just turned....24, yeah... I also had a chance to make fun of him because he kept yawning and has a penchant for falling asleep as shows apparently.  Speaking of people in the audience, Maryellen and I couldn't tell whether the person next to us was male or female.  I think we deduced female.    The encore was the best encore I have ever seen, I was nearly in tears.  Steve warned me that I would like it since Philly wasn't privileged enough to get an encore.  They played Cinnamon Lips boy band style.  They synchronized their dancing and lip synched the entire song.  It was a great moment in rock and roll.  The Backstreet Boys would have been envious.  We hung out outside of the venue which was enjoyable :-).  Left Hoboken shortly after midnight and made it home in less than two hours.  Ugh, work in the morning.

      I was at the record store all day after I came home, but was able to escape for a rock show.  Marlon Spike playing at the Logan House.  I picked up Jamie and Tanya and we hit the road once again.  On the way we were talking about crowd antics at shows, including the ever present display of air guitar.  We ponder if this would happen at a Marlon Spike show, especially because they don't have a guitarist.    This show was the debut of their saucy new shirts and were smartly displayed on their new merch board.  Nice.  Jamie became the merch bitch.  :-)  Maryellen and I text each other prior to the show, as we often do, then my mom called so the only place I could actually hear was the bathroom.  In there I ran into some girls from high school, who remembered me but I forgot their names or even who they really were.  I hope that wasn't snotty of me.  Oh well.    As Marlon Spike was playing, Tanya and I took our shots and beverages to the front to yell like silly girls and dance like even sillier girls.  Todd couldn't make the gig, but the band was still on it.  They sounded great and I have to give it second place in the "best Marlon Spike shows I have seen."  And yes, the air guitar came out, but I don't think anyone was laughing harder then Jamie, Tanya, and me due to our previous conversation.  Two guys went absolutely nuts in their crazy dancing towards the end of the set and it was phenomenal.  Took some decent pictures and they will be up soon.   Went to Gallucio's for some drinks after, then drove to the diner.  One of Dan's friends was supposed to come out, so we found it necessary to call him mulitple times from all of our cells phones at 2:30 in the morning.  I think it was the first time I ever uttered the word "douchebag" and to a complete stranger.  The best was sober Jamie who left a mesage saying that he didn't know him, but if he did, he'd kick his ass.  He said it fiercely and it was hilarious since Jamie is one of the nicest guys ever.  We then called Derek, who actually picked up his phone and was literally running from the bar to a party.  He said he had to go because he had another call coming through, which was Chris, and I think Dan and Jamie left messages during that ordeal.  Again, I guess this is only funny if you were there drunk at the diner at 2:30 am with cell phones.  Somehow the conversation changed to Tanya's communist tendencies.  I recollect us talking about her being English, though with a Russian name, so maybe that is wear it originated, but she had on a red shirt and a red jacket, so that just proved she is a commie.  :-)  I drop off Dan at his car and we both raced each other on the streets of Wilmington, though we were blasting OK Go instead of singing loudly and off-key to Brand New.  I was messing with him on 95 by going 30 mph in front of him and blocking his exit, but he got off and beat us home somehow.  As we were heading towards our own exit, we saw smoke and passed a car engulfed in flames.  Freaky.

      Benji from Marwood and Dina came down from New York City to join me on air last Friday and it was highly entertaining.  Benji fronts the rock band Marwood and came down with his acoustic to play some tunes, talk on air, and pick my playlist.  He is very intriguing to talk to, has led such an interesting life.  He started out as a roadie fro Genesis, Phil Collins, and Def Leopard in Europe when he was nine and left school at 16 to persue music by busking in the subways.  He moved to upstate NY, then the city, and Marwood was born.  In a nutshell.  We took some crazy pictures and it was enjoyable.  Robbie, from Marwood, also called in while he was working at his coffeeshop.  I could hear him make stuff in the background and it was great.  He made an espresso on air and I swear Dina was in the hallway on the ground from laughter.  Good times.  Around midnight, Tanya and I headed over Chris's to join him and Dan hanging out.  Talked for a bit then decided that a season of Family Guy had to be watched, and I admitted I haven't seen an episode.  What was I missing?!  Of course not too far into it, Chris fell asleep then we all drifted off by 5 am.  Mind you I haven't slept a substantial amount in days, so any place I can garner some Zs was enjoyable.  Even contorted on a loveseat.  I kept waking up every hour adjusting my spine and trying not to push Chris off.  I found that if I made myself into a little ball I conserved heat and my spine was straight, though feeling was lost in some apendages.  Spine is a funny word, and you kinda forget its there until its in a weird position.  Spine spine spine spine spine.  So Tanya and I had to be back in Newark by noonish for her test and my work, and surprisingly she got up in time.  So we grab our things and were about to head upstairs and out the door and onwards to Newark until we heard activity from the first floor.  We both don't know his family that well, though we have both met them, and emerging from the basement at 11 am in front of his family on a Saturday morning just seemed odd at the time.  So we're standing at the base of the stairs going over the game plan and his dad opens the door and just sees us standing there.  So damn funny now, but we were in shock then and couldn't really speak except for "Hi! I'm Tanya!" "Hi! I'm Miranda!".  We informed him that we were leaving and he asked if Chris knew so one of us, can't remember who, or maybe both of us, said that he was still sleeping so we didn't want to wake him.  Which just sounded weird saying that to Mr. LoPresto at 11 am as we were leaving.  We're in my car laughing at the situation and everything is funny on a few hours of sleep.

      Ok Go & Spiraling at the Northstar (Wed Feb 4) - woohoo!!  Miss Dina hooked me up with a guestlist spot and the show totally rocked.  I absolutely love the Northstar.  And seeing one of my favorite bands (OK Go) at one of my favorite venues is sure to make a girl smile.    I get to the venue and meet up with Dina and James, who I actually knew in college - he was writing an article on the show.  Sprialing opened the show and I was immediately impressed with their musicianship.  Songs that stuck out the most were "Lightning Twice" and a new song with the word "Radio" in the title.  I was able to snap some pictures, seeing how I was towering over the 15 year old girlies, and they will be on the site soon.    Between sets, I was bored and it was too loud to call anyone and everyone I knew there was working the show, so I pull out my phone and text message.  Of course Maryellen was privileged enough to get the girlie side of the show, and I mass text messaged everyone i knew who either wanted to go to the show, or who was going to go to an upcoming OK Go show.  I had seen the setlist prior to the show, so i texted the setlist as well.  More on this later.  OK Go was awesome.  Aweome.  Such a great live band.  I love their CD, and their performance just takes it to another level.  I have only seen OK Go once before, last spring at the Blue Star in Lancaster, PA with Melissa and Rick and Steve and Ken.  The setlist is on my site, so you can go there.  They debuted a lot of new songs, which were really decent.  I'll say which ones I like during the Hoboken review.  Damian was absolutely nuts on stage.  Though Tim does add an interesting factor, his mic was up way too much for half the show.  Damian shared with the audience how Jorge hates Philadelphia because his cat ate the paraffin infested cheese on a Philly cheesesteak and nearly died.  It was heartwarming.  they played their unreleased Train song.  No encore.  Talked to Dina and Spiraling after the show in the green room, and Dina introduced me to the OK Go guys.  I think I nearly peed myself when Damian and I started talking about his new album and what I thought and whatnot.  We all agree, except for the band, that the Train song should be on the new album.  They said no.  I told Tim it should be a b side on vinyl, and that may happen.  haha, so if it happens, I take full credit.  I will even autograph it for you.  I think I have lost all dignity on the GTT messageboard.  The next day Steve informs all about my obscure text messages and says that I am borderline.  I am taking borderline as being "borderline badass to the max" and not "borderline i think i'm going to lose my mind" as he said before, but he may have been sleepy, hence the wrong meaning of "borderline" being uttered.

      Tuesday and Wednesday were supposed to be my days off, but I spent all of last week renovating the record store.  Man, I haven't lifted so much crap in years.  But it looks so much nicer now.  Though we all love each other and our family is really small, I think we all lost sanity from being around each other way too much last week.   But of course, it makes us stronger because we endure change together and we all created our store.  And I am so very excited that we now have room for acoustic performances.  yeeeeeaaaaaahhhhhh.  And i put up all of the posters on the wall.  All of them.  Took me for freaking ever.  But its the greatest wallpaper you will ever see.

      I am retrogressing a little over a week.  I have been crazily busy lately so anytime spent at my apartment has been either spent sleeping or getting ready to run out again, definitely not in front of my computer.  So I will go backwards and update you on snippets of the past week.  You care because I care.  I spent my Monday nigth after work at Kate's for Quizzo with Dan, Chris, and Derek.  Of course there was show promotion going on and devouring of nachos.  In a sentence, Quizzo is four rounds of trivia questions where the victor of each round gets booze of some sort.  And its not that chump electronic trivia found at every bar.  The evening is laced with Geno and Dan's colorful humorous rants and quips about people in the audience, which makes the evening that much more enjoyable.  So, let's start the evening off right...  There was this Hispanic man who came up the stairs mid-rant and probably has no idea what he was in for.  So of course they proceed to make fun of him for something, in which the man had to respond with "Your mom...(something about whatever comment was made)...bitch!".  And it was funny the first time, but EVERY time this guy said this sentence, it got more annoying.  And what made the annoyance more grating was the fact that he moved right next to our table and continued to yell this utterance over tip of us.  Chris's expressions were priceless, as if someone was scraping their fingernails across a blackboard.  He later said this on the message board at 2:37am, which sums it up perfectly:   Your momma.. apocalyptic.. b*tch!  (NOTE: This is the sort of thing that was SCREAMED in my ear for the first half hour of Quizzo tonight at Kate's in Newark, DE.  While I appreciate the fact that the guy SCREAMING was having a good time on his buddy's birthday, I really appreciate the fact that he left once his group got cut off by Joel the bartender.)   The guy and his friends got kicked out and it was awesome.  We lost by two points and that was not as awesome as the guy getting kicked out.   Afterwards Dan and Chris came back to my place, where Dan proceeded to pass out on my papasan chair.  He informed me that my water cures hangovers and drunkeness.  He said that everytime he drinks it he is isntantly cured.  Must be all of those Newark chemicals!  So Dan is passed out and Chris and I mess around on the computer and cure our drunkeness by talking.  I learned a lot about his musical history that I didn't know before and he gained a lot more respect from me.  Not that he hadn't already, but I was really intrigued and amazed with how he got into playing and performing as well as things he has been involved with.  Around 4 am we contemplate whether Dan is going to go home and change before going to work at 9am.  I tell Chris that Dan could wear his pants and he responds with, "look at Dan, he's lanky as crap!".  Which I guess is only funny if you are either myself or Chris or if it is 4 in the morning.  We finally pass out around 6 am from exhaustion.

      I saw Rod Stewart perform on Wednesday and nearly ate my words for calling him a chump.  I was talking to Ken before leaving and he chuckled at the fact I had to see Rod.  Rod.  Yeah.  So on the way I was telling my mom how they changed the First Union Center to Wachovia Center, thus changing the name from the FU Center to the Wack Off Center.  Then I laughed because I was seeing Rod at the Wack Off Center.  Funny.  We get there and I am the youngest one around.  People are amusing.  Every guy was in tow of a woman or was gay.  Seriously.  There was a couple behind me while waiting to get inside... woman: look happy, we're going to have fun tonight! man: do you think they will showing the game tonight on one of the tv screens?  I think that man shared the same sentiment as the rest of the hetero male population at the Wack Off Center.  It was kinda cute to see everyone so excited about the show, I guess I have gotten so jaded because of the amazing talent I see at initimate shows.  And I hope I never grow tired of that.    My mom and I grab our seats and they were super close to the stage, which was great.  So many women brought flowers, I thought I was going to puke.  I saw some woman leave from the side of the stage and I pointed her out to my mom and said "there wen't Rod's floozy".  I didn't expect her to retort with "she probably just gave him a blow job".  I nearly fell out of my chair because I don't think I have ever heard her say that before.  Every guy in audience looked miserable, and then I become enlightened realizing that Rod has probably gotten more ass than all of the men in the crowd combined.  I verbalized this, apparently a little too loudly, and everyone around me concurred and laughed.  Rod takes the stage with my favorite Rod song, Forever Young.  He looked like a rocker and exploded on stage.  I was completely taken aback.  Man, granted, I think of him more as a performer than a musician, and I was impressed.  His band was great.  The bassist is from Philly and I think the lead guitarist is his son.  After his seventh song he turned around and adjusted himself.  I saw it.    Rod sure was energetic for nearing 60 and the ladies swooned.  One thing that stuck out was how into himself Rod is.  His name is plastered everywhere and every screen behind him had old 80's pictures of himself during his performance.  Very amusing.  What a shmooze.  He took a break and came back with the Philadelphia Orchestra and a tux and played that American Songbook crap.  Shmmoooooooze.  At 11:30 pm it was done and all went home.  The Rod Stewart thong was $15 so I didn't purchase it.

      So in addition to my usual life in upheaval, I have not been around the people I usually hang around and its strange.    But when you discover that one close friend was convicted of something major a few years ago and an even closer friend is using (and I don't mean anything tame), your life gets a big shove into reality and perspective.  We all have our bills to pay, our relationship woes, our constant struggles, but this is life and death.   I don't know how I feel...angry that I have known this person for years and that person is putting themselves in this situation that is totally unlike them?  Hurt that this person and I have both witnessed people we know fall into this same trap and not make it out alive?  Abandoned?  Ignorant?  When you see someone all the time you don't realize the subtle signs that are apparently tell tale.    We keep pummeling through this nightmare and I am wondering when we'll wake because I don't feel strong enough.

      I'm really really cold right now.  There is no heat in my apartment.  I thought i turned it up before I left the store, but perhaps I did not.  My mom brought over some peanut butter oreos since she knew I have been going insane lately with the amount of work I need to get done in regard to Rainbow, WVUD, NYU, and well, life.  They are out of arms reach because they are dangerous.  Rambling rambling rambling.  My fingers are too cold to write my essay, but not too cold to blog.  I had this one roommate who liked to put on the AC during the winter while the rest of us froze.  Bitch.

      Only at Rainbow can I tell the owners that I am cutting out early to drive a few hours to see a show and he is understanding :-)  Tanya and I threw common sense out the window and decided to go up 95 to the Knitting Factory to support Marlon Spike's New York City debut.  She had more to sacrifice though, she is student teaching at Newark and has to start her day around 6am.  But at least Monday was a holiday for her :-).  We were going to leave around 3 and hang out around the City, but Dan called while I was at work and we all decided to drive up together in the evening.    Tanya and I watched the Cosby show and I caught up on emails before making the customary stop to Wawa for caffiene, cash, and dinner.  How great is Wawa?  We loaded up Dan's Subaru and were on our way with Hey Mercedes leading the way.  Sark called when we were a few miles away from the city around 7:15 and told Dan that times got changed and they play at 8 instead of 10.  Dan told him he wasn't going to show up.  It was a good joke :-).  I was navigator and that was not a good idea.  Who puts West Broadway parallel to Broadway!!?  Does that make any sense what so ever?  So then we turn around and go down a one way.  But we made it to the Knitting factory with an awesome spot in front of the gym with pillars.  We bring down the gear then go down the street to the McDonalds.  Tanya and I braved the scary bathrooms and survived.  We went back to the Knitting Factory and watched Amy Ward, but I don't think any one of us really enjoyed her so we talked instead.  Fooling April came on and I liked them, I have seen shows where they have played, but have always missed them for some reason or another.  Their guitarist, Rado Randriamamonjy, was on the Cosby show as Vanessa's boyfriend.    Marlon Spike performed last and were on it.  Such a good show, perhaps third on the all time great list.  Setlist is up on my website.  The stage was a bit confining, but they rocked it for a full house.  Before the love song, "Melody", Sark informed the crowd of truck nuts.  He told us this at Micky D's, how Todd and he saw a truck with, well, nuts on the back.  Perhaps it was the same truck that the GTT guys saw the bumper sticker that said "no humping"?  Silly NJ drivers :-).  Sark also inquired whether there were chrome truck nuts.  As the story was starting I think Chris knew what was coming and tried to stop it, but it didn't happen.    But the interesting part of the night was when Chris' piano dropped out of tune during Jade.  Well, not Chris' piano, but Brian's from Fooling April.  440 not 424 haha.  Wait, not funny.  But we have pictures to prove it.  The microphone picked up all of his colorful commentary during the whole ordeal during which he told Sark to take a drum solo.  So we had a few minutes of drums, bass, and sax before they ended with Foolish Pride and This Time Around.  After selling lots of stuff, the three of us headed out into the cold to the Dunkin Donuts nearby.  Who closes a Dunkin Donuts at 9pm?!?!  Back into the car and through the Holand Tunnel.  A truck was driving next to us putting cones out in the tunnel and I tired to take a picture of it, but I suck and I missed it.  We were disappointed, but I mentioned that it may happen again.  We get to the DD in Hoboken and were fueled by sugary goodness.     urlLink Just checked the board and Sark posted about NYC   make sure you check out the Truck Nutz link.

      Just saw this and thought it was funny so I will share with you...  From Miranda's Journal... I just saw Miranda's journal and read the story in there about the night that me and her went to the Grape Street to see MR. NORTH. It's a pretty succinct overview of the night, and I especially like the part about "gaydars". I'm going to have to add that to my vocabulary. Also...Wawa's sweet cream cheese pretzels, aren't just a pretzel. They're a way of life. Thanks for showing me the way to truth, Miranda.

      I gave myself a break from researching and went to Wawa for caffeine.  Its routine, whenever I know I will be staying up late, whether it was editing or schoolwork, and now driving and just staying up, Wawa coffee just does it for me.  Its just the smell and the taste that reminds me that I will be up for a whole and the trusty taupe and green cups will guide me through.  I can't even tell you how many Wawa runs we made throughout college for STN related stuff as well as all nighters trying to get papers and projects done.    Last night there were 9 days since the last incident, so I checked tonight and it displayed 69.  Now either two months flew by or there is some sixteen year old kid laughing hysterically right now.

      So I heard from New York University.  I received a thin envelope while I was at work and was so nervous that I took it to the back to read it because I didn't know what I wanted the inside to contain.    They are now asking for me to: "Write a topical, minimum 500 word-essay addressing the business and privacy issues related to the recent RIAA v. Verizon case.  Include your own argument on one side of the case".  I have until February 24th to send the essay via email or fax.  Which wouldn't be a problem at all if it wasn't for my rockstar lifestyle haha.  Can I just write that I will be going to NYC three times before the deadline to see shows as well as two additional shows in Philadelphia this week while still at Rainbow 30 hours a week and working with my horses every morning?  Nope, guess not.  Bring it on, challenge!!!  This essay may make or break my acceptance because I am wondering if I was borderline and that is why they are sending me this assignment, i f everyone got an essay question,or if I made the first cut.  No idea.    Of course today I have done a whole lot of nothing.  No wait, I did venture out to visit Rainbow and go out to lunch.  And I moved from my futon to my papason.  And yay for laptops that can move with me.  " urlLink La Bamba " was on Bravo earlier and I had to watch the end of the movie.  Funny, I remember seeing that movie in the theatres in Germany and it was the first movie I cried at, I must have been like, seven.  And it was on today as I began my research for my NYU paper.  Full circle, it all comes full circle.

      Aurora is one of the closest friends I have ever had and it scares me how much she can read me :-).  And I am LOVING how ballsy she was in her last "situation" though it is not going how I anticipated, and though it is definitely not the end, I am glad to see her like this.   It's definitely a good thing.  Sometimes you can't deny how you feel and though both Aurora and I are very strong willed and not girly girls or one of those stupid girls we continuously come in contact with who need a guy to exist as a person, its fun to fall.  So good luck to the situation - or BUST! :-)  And damn her for knowing me!!  And telling me to go for something.  Don't you love my vagueness.

      I spent most of my Valentine's Day at the record store with Maryanne and Jamie.  The evening was dabbled with conversations about boys, personal injuries, sucky friends, and awful movies.  Of course we drew in some customers to join our ramblings.  Sometimes I think we forget that people can hear us and half the time they come in just to see what we are talking about haha.  We are such the entertainers.  Jamie is hilarious, we think the same way and, well, we are elitists - or at least we think that way.  We know we rule, haha not really, we just live in our own little world.    Chris M. came down from Jersey and met me at the store before we departed for Melissa's for an evening of laughing, bitching, making fun, and drinking while watching basketball, SNL, and playing video games.  As soon as we got there I made a mess in the kitchen by dropping my bottle (it didn't break though) and Chris followed up by spilling his beverage in the dining room.  Aurora said something that was witty that would fit perfectly in here, but as I write this, I forgot what it was.  A highlight was the carbombs we did and chased with samoas.  Brilliant.  No place would deliver, so Aurora, Chris, and I went to Wawa (aka Mecca), for sustenence for everyone.  Melissa wouldn't let me take my drink with me, so I stole another out of the fridge.  We sang Graham just for Chris in the car and followed it up with the Low Life.  LDE would have been proud ;-).  The Wawa has been incident free for 9 days.  I tried to finish a bottle of wine, from the bottle, but Melissa and Nate took it away from me more than half way through.  We watched the Chappelle show and laughed our asses off.  It was the one with John Mayer on it.  Chris was passing out on the papasan so it was time to leave.  And no guys, I did not get sick.  Yay me.

      Marlon Spike took the stage at the Ground Floor on Thursday night, which only means one thing...  The girls (Aurora, Tanya, Marissa, Amanda, Meg, Katherine, and myself) hung out in the apartment before going to the show.  We caught up and talked and drank and were giddy.  We weren't drunk, just excited, its been way too long and I don't think any one of us were ever quiet before leaving.    Best drink of the moment: Stoli Strasberi (sp), lemonade, & 7-UP.  We arrived a little into our set and immediately we said we had to stand in our usual spot, which was just funny in itself since we only go to the Ground Floor if Marlon Spike is playing.  And I feel bad since most  of their set was spent with the girls talking amongst ourselves.  But we did dig what we heard and saw!  Aurora and I had a bet on Chris' outfit, and we lost.  On both accounts, down to the socks ;-).  We all were just being crazy.  Had an interesting conversation with Anthony and Tanya and I craftily avoided creepy Dave.  Oliver, Elise, and Nick were present at the GF and I remember talking to Nick about something...or other....yeah, but he didn't go on stage.  Oh, during that conversation, MS played a cover - was it Tears for Fears...?  I cannot recall.    As soon as MS ended, the GF turned into a hooched out dance party.  Dude, it was like 3 degrees outside and all of a sudden underage girlies in tank tops appeared out of the woodwork.  None of us are ever like that, so of course we had to be obnoxious to the line of freezing cold girls waiting in line with their F--- Me Boots and mini skirts.    So we laughed all the way to Peace of Pizza where getting two pizzas sounded like the best idea ever at 11:30 pm.  We bothered the pizza boys and entertained them with our antics and they hooked us up.  Nice.  Dan met us on my porch as we walked back to my place to eat and drink.  My place was way to bright so Dan and I played with lightbulbs and electricity and that was not the best idea.  We both ended up getting the shit shocked out of us and burning some bulbs.    The kitchen was loud and giddy as we talked about Dewey, drinking, nakedness, and the upcoming weekend and beyond.  Everyone left shortly after and Chris and I played on the computer and I think Sting was still playing.  Yay for iPods.  Shortly after, Aurora and Jackman came back over.  We're all on the futon and Chris passes out in usual fashion as Jackman makes fun of Aurora.    Jackman's friend is putting on a show in which U2 is headlining and if you have read previous blogs, you will know that Aurora is infatuated with Bono.  So of course Jackman said that she can meet him, and of course he is hanging this over her head.  Aurora said something mean and Jackman informed her that "this is not the way to meet Bono."  Hilarious.  Throughout the night, Aurora and I had an agreement.  And we would either fulfill it, or bust.  Well, I did not fulfill my end, and she did.  OR BUST! :-)

      Geez.  Friday night was the first Center Stage night of 2004.  I had on my away message something to the effect of "who knows what will happen..." because honest to goodness, every single Center Stage taping is an adventure of some sort.  Drama just finds us.    Anything from  urlLink hostile venue management to being stuck in 3 hour traffic to almost getting in accidents in a monsoon  to  urlLink being locked in a vehicle in the ghetto for two hours  to our  urlLink equipment sparking on stage  to the awfulness that was Rowan University.  Every single taping has NOT gone to plan, granted they have all turned out mostly decent, nothing has been created through smooth sailing.  So we always cross our fingers.    I was so excited for last night.  Come on, its everything I love - hanging out with great people, having a good time, at a venue, videotaping, and the music.  I think thats why CS always has a great crew, and an even better time.   urlLink To get a feel of this band, check out the entry for the Dewey Beach Music Festival, these guys are the nicest guys in rock and roll.  Haha and they always tell the story on how usually its the bands trying to find a place to crash, but in Dewey it was three girls with nowhere to sleep and they WILLINGLY gave up their beds and went home early just so we could stay somewhere.  We get back from partying with GTT and James Harvey band and come back to them sleeping and they get up and leave at 5 am instead of 6am just so we can sleep.    We leave ahead of schedule in anticipation of the traffic and hit 95 with Rob and Jay in one van and Ed, Epler, Marissa, and myself in another van.  Marissa and I talk most of the time, then find a great staion halfway to Baltimore.  We park on the top floor of the garage overlooking the city and have an hour to kill before load-in because the trip there was extremely swift.  Oh, six Swift trucks, and one had a green front - bonus points.    Marissa and I decide on the pizza place we went to last time because its cheap, close, and quick.  We order two large pizzas and a two-liter bottle of coke.  Inside they have two tables, three chairs, and no cups.  We hover around the table and talk and perhaps I was the last to know, i have no idea, but I made eye contact with Marissa and she mouthed the words "fight" and glanced over the staff.  I look up and this guy and girl are both arguing with the guys at the store.  Something about his sister, colorful words were exchanged, physical harm was threatened, things were thrown I think.  And we were are just all silent eating all afraid a gun was going to be pulled out.  As soon as we left Ed and Epler said it would be best if we left so we head back to the garage.  What a wonderful start to our evening that really hasn't begun yet.    We load up one van with all of our equipment and Rob and Marissa drive it to the venue while we stake out the place.  The Funk Box is one of our favorite venues, so it was really great to be filming there.  See the Fools and Horses guys outside and say hi.  Kent thought Jay's name was Jed, which reminded up of the Jed Clampett truck from the first time we rented vehicles for CS and we laughed.   We load in with the band and I find Marissa talking to some guy and I overhear her say assertively that we are supposed to be here.  I asked Jay what's up and he says that the venue promoter had no idea the CS would be there and it can't happen.  Marissa definitely cleared it with the band and the venue and talked to both on the phone, not email where things could be screwed up.  She isn't the type of person to ignore a step in the concert filming process and we know from experience to make sure the venue knows everything.  So I totally know she wasn't at fault and I am glad she stood her ground.  And unfortunately we just half to take it.  More often then not, the venue just gets really intimidated by our equipment then is really impressed with our professionalism.  So all in all, we unpacked and set up pretty quickly, but with the portable studio in the fire escape route.  I definitely do not think that was legal in any sense.  I deemed it Marissa's cave and at least I can see her through the doorway so I could spy on her with the camera haha.    Ed and I were both on the sides of the stage with Rob and Jay on the second level.  Marissa and I were talking of Maroon 5 on the way down and the venue played it before the show, sweet, so the boys dealt with us singing over the headsets.  We all scouted out the area and spied and talked about people in attendence over the headsets.  I started filming Marissa through the door to her cave and Tim and Kent saw this and provided much entertainment for the tape.  I'm just glad no one got naked for it.    The guys hit the stage and it was filming time.  Went by so quickly and I loved most of the shots I got.  Screw the corwd, I get my shots.  Unfortunately I had to deal with a moniter in front of me, but it caused fro creativity.  And I got awesome shoe shots haha.  They played an awesome set and it sounded great.  I should know, I was right in front of the speaker.  They covered the Darkness for their last song and it was the greatest thing ever.    They were playing with the All Mighty Senators so we couldn't pack up all of our stuff until they were done, so we relaxed in the hallway and did the interview upstairs.  The Funk Box's green room is spectacular.  Thats the only reason he see bands there, haha jk.  I discovered a ladder and FAH tells me it goes out to a balcony...sweet!  So Marissa and I go up there and film, then start the interview.  Again, a CS interview is usually more like a runaway train because you never know what the hell is going to come out of it.  The best was when Kent discovered his shirt was unbuttoned, his face was priceless.  They kept doing do-overs to make themselves sound semi professional.  And maybe one day Paul McCartney will open for them, when he gets better.  It was a touching moment when they described the atmosphere with Kent being in Boston and them in the Baltimore area.  :-).  Bill tried to maintain a semblence of normalcy, but that didn't work either.  After viewing the tape, I'll post more on the highlights of the interview.    After the interview, the other band was STILL playing and we were all cold and tired and ready to go home since we were exhausted.  Ed, Marissa, and I did the only logical thing and walked to 7-11 for sustenence.  7-11 so does NOT compare to Wawa.  I haven't had a slurpee in like ten years, and the banana one was enjoyable, though it tasted like yellow.  Federal Hill, where the venue is, is this nice area with a bunch of bars, so of course everyone was dressed up decently and drunk, and you have the three of us bundled up in our "we're filming a band" clothes and slurpees and donuts and coffee.  What a sight.    Back the venue and the freaking band still was not done.  Get to our cave and as soon as I stepped in I look at Ed, Epler, and Jay and say "this hallways so does not smell legal".  Someone was participating in some activities downstairs and shots were taken by the band in our cave.  Three frekaing encores.  COME ON!!!!  Usually I wouldnt mind this, but we just wanted to get the hell home.  We decided that when they were done, we just rip up our wires and deal with coiling them later.    Finally they were done,  and we seriously just went and ripped.  Marissa and I didn't even deal with the gaff tape and warned Jay to just bring some scissors tomorrow.  Seriously.  If you have ever seen our wiring setup, you would understand why we coil.  Screw it.  We had hundreds of feet of XLR and video cable in a bundle.  The bundle was so huge I couldn't carry it out myself so Epler and I did while explaining why there was so much wrong with what we are doing.  The two graduates are the ones breaking all the rules.  Carlos would have a shit fit if he saw our bundle.  Jay wouldn't let us hold it long enough for us to take a picture because it was cold outside.    Marissa came out of the venue beaming and said how pleased the management was and how we're invited back and they want to work with Center Stage "six or seven times".  What was that number!!?!? Haha.  We lose Rob and Jay en route to 95, but once we hit the highway, I was gone.  I never fall asleep in the car, and I passed out.

      My eyes are extremely red and my face itches.  A sure sign that I am way behind tired.  But Fridays are always rock and roll :-).    Work...radio...CENTER STAGE FILMING...sleep...work...Marlon Spike in-store...perhaps a little NYC action  And I didn't finish my essay.  I think I may have even fell asleep at the computer.  Bringing the laptop with me to the show tonight.  Seriously now, I may have to lock myself in the van and get this done.  It's almost done.  It's written, just not edited.  Sheesh.  It's not hard, I just need to be more concise.    Record store time.

      Well, tonights the night, kids.  Another one of those glorious "my paper is due tomorrow so I will not go to bed until its done" nights that I knew all too well in college.  I never really envied those who got their stuff done either on time or early, because they never had anything else to do in between.  The thrill of the approaching deadline is much more exhilerating.  So extremely tired.  Another looooong ten hour day at work.  Four of those in a row kinda gets to you.  Jamie, Raf, Jim, and I have seen way too much of each other lately.  I tend to gaze out the window and make comments towards the passerby and its gotten to the point where Jim joins in.  Some kid came in today and started hanging things up without even asking us, and Jim is staring at him.  The kids leaves and Jim  goes to see what he hung up and said he was going to take it down.  I say no, that that kid can do whatever he wants because he has cool hair.  So of course this goes into a conversation about my penchant for awesome spikey or shaggy hair.  He then points out people asking my opinion.  I guess it was funnier there just seeing Jim and I talk about this.  Nevermind.   Seriously.  Don't wear flannel and a washed out Metallica t-shirt and acid wash tight jeans while still sporting the perm with your bangs in that wave thing and flashing your keys with eight of those plastic keychains with stupid quotes on them and be snippy with me because I will NOT order your Fates Warning CD if you have an attitude.  The day was brought to us by the following CDs - we have all been too lazy to even change them out of the player:  Burning Spear, Matt Nathanson, Sheryl Crow, Marlon Spike, Norah Jones.  I now know all of the words to the Best of Sheryl Crow and I don't think that is a good thing.  (sorry guys, i thought the following was funny...)  I think Raf and I were eating or something and Marlon Spike is playing and Raf starts singing along.  And at the same moment I was thinking "I don't really like this line".  So I laugh and tell Raf that I think its an odd line, and he laughs and says "me too, it bothers me every time I hear that one line".  This is what happens when you listen to the same five CDs for the past 4 days, you notice the idiosyncrasies with everything.  Our vinyl room is looking better.  I also hung up the new Hootie poster with pride in plain view of everyone.  My shift was highlighted by visits from Eric, Korweck, the 60 year old stoner who I always forget his name, Randy, Chris, Jason, and some random guy who recognized my voice and said he listens to my radio show.  He sold back the Thrills CD, shame on him.  Wrote to some record labels and talked to my usual A & R people.  Thursday nights were made for e-mail.  Where the hell are my damn Touch & Go LP bags??!!  I was not happy when the mailman didn't come in with them today.  Sorted some stuff out for the in-store on Saturday.  Yay it was listed in some weekly magazine, I forget which one now.    Of course Jamie and I talked the entire night and tried to keep each other awake since we both barely slept last night.  It was a pretty low key day.  Blah.  I went to Wawa to get the staff of life - coffee and a sweet cream stuffed pretzel (they were out of the mac and cheese!) and noticed that the Wawa is still 99 days incident free.

      A good thing about living on Main Street is that i don't think I can ever sleep past 10 am because of all of the truck and people noise.  Dammit.  Went to bed around 4:30 am and woke up at 9:30 am.  I'm really tired right now and I haven't even really started my day yet.  Yeehaw, I wrote another paragraph.  I should just admit that I will never change and will always perfect the art of procrastination.   I actually blame Chris C. for not having a day off this week.  He's in Florida so I have been working way over time since he isn't around.  He owes me big time.  I inadvertently picked up the stupid Atkins diet version of my usual orange juice at the store and it tastes like crap.  Kinda reminscent of Tang, which was a tasty beverage years ago, I don't think I want to jumpstart my day with it.    The Atkins diet pisses me off too.  Raf is actually on it and has lost 25 pounds so far.  It's pretty entertaining to see what he can and cannot eat.  While we were renovating he disappeared for about an hour so we thought he was on the roof sneaking in some carbs.  Last night Jamie asked Raf if he could eat a peanut butter and honey sandwich and we thought he may explode just thinking about all that carb goodness.  But yeah, my point being is that I don't enjoy the Atkins craze in the grocery store.

      Here I am sitting at my laptop dabbling on my essay looking at my bed and realizing I shouldn't.    And as I fiercely contemplate the angle of which I am approaching my topic, I am more aggressive towards what is at the back of my mind.    Most of my close friends know that I would rather have brutal honesty than being coddled.  Hahah I think I was actually telling Jamie this the other day, I can't recall.  Tell me the truth regardless on how badly it will hurt because covering it up will hurt more in the long run because I would have been deceived in addition to whatever the hurt may be that they are trying to hide.  Trust me, I have been through it enough to know which I would rather have.  I am strong enough to handle it.    But don't ever ever EVER try to read me.  Don't assume.  And the more someone tries to kiss my ass, the more I balk away.  I don't like it when people do things for me, and I especially shy away from attention.  Unless of course when I am drunk and me singing and dancing in front of everyone is perfectly ok.    And whats worse off is when someone tells your friends something that isn't entirely true, making you feel like a fifteen year old girl.  Also creating something that was really nothing, and blaming it on anything else than the real issue.  Seriously now, I haven't played this game in years.  And the more time people spend playing games is the more I am not going to put myself in that position.  I have enough real life drama to worry about than this.  And people wonder why I am so icy.  Angst is done for right now.  Alright, back to this essay so I can get the hell out of here.

      Wednesday nights in tropical talk means Kahuna.  The club brings in original local music on Wednesdays and tonight John Faye and Marlon Spike rocked Wilmington.  After another excrutiatingly long day at work, Marissa, Aurora, and I went to the show.  We have all been so busy the past few weeks so it was great to just chill and hang out.  There werent that many people in attendance at the club, but it worked out for us since we just walked in without having to pay.  Met up with Chris, Dan, and Todd and John waved to us from the stage.  We found a table and some nachos and were set for the night.  John played a solo acoustic set with some IKE songs and a lot of new songs.  Setlist is on the site, or will be soon - depending on when you read this.  He played Welcome Home, the anthem of the Center Stage girls, and of course we sang along.  Aurora and I shouted during Deathbed, during which John said my name during the song while I was talking, but Aurora saved me and we carried out the end of the song.  Ended with Pyramid and it was great.  Chatted with John and Jim after the show then Chris gave me a full blown tutorial on how to use his camera, then started the show under pretty lights and tv screen.  Soon after they started playing, Marissa, Aurora, and I had a dire need to regroup in the bathroom.  Come back out and I make full use of Chris's camera, though digitals sometimes bother me in regards to live events because the moment you meant to capture is usually not the one that saves.  We'll see how the turn out.  After bothering everyone at Kahuna with the flash, I join the table.  We end up laughing and talking most of the time, so hopefully we weren't too much of a distraction.  Dan had his wireless bass and spun.  I even drew a picture of it in my book.  Among other pictures.  Then I stabbed a picture with my pen.    Sark did something wrong and said "I fucking messed that up!  Damn!  I gave up cussing and I already messed that up too!  Shit!"    Our waitress gave us Mardi Gras beads so Aurora said to the guys, but only loud enough for us to hear, "show us your tits"!  In which Chris said soon after, "did you see that, Aurora".  Which was odd because they both weren't addressing the same thing.    They ended around 11:45, we said good bye to everyone then headed out.  While the car was warming up, we cleaned up the inside a little bit since Aurora's car takes 20 minutes to stop clunking ;-).  I take stuff out to the dumpster then meet up with Jim in the parking lot where we talk about music and the scene and our various bands and whatnot.  Ideas are formulating.  Get in the car and we head back to Newark singing some Ryan Montbleau and Graham Colton and talk about stupid things we do.  After dropping Marissa off Aurora and I go to Wawa for coffee.  The Newark Wawa has been incident free for 99 days.  Fallacy!  So we drive around Newark just talking about everything since we haven't really talked in weeks.  We try to catch each other up on the important stuff, and her and I both talk way too much, so you know we didn't get it all in.  She told me about all the developments and I told her how the world around me is falling apart.  Aurora is the one person I have complete trust in and know that I can tell her anything, so I told her everything that I haven't been able to tell anyone else.  Two of my closest friends have found themselves in situations far worse then anything I could have imagined and its great to know that Aurora understands, rather then people who think that the reason I haven't been around selfishly pertains to them.  Instead I am trying to save a life or two from being worse than it is, not worrying about who said what to whom or who likes who or who isn't around or who isn't at home.

      Stopped at a red light, I look in my rearview at the car behind me.  The driver was singing and looking around here and she looked a little frightened, so I look at her passenger.  Yeah, he was swigging a beer.  It's funny, because we do that too.

      Argh.  Jamie and I rule at life.  So awesome at it.  First off, the last hour of being open was craziness from odd phone calls and strange visitors.  Then whatever could go wrong with our computers did go wrong and they were all fritzed out and some creepy guy was at the window and it was scary and everything blew up on us.    Right now I feel frustrated so I will type this: nfdwiejcfefjewjropermdjdoew

      Last night I could have gone to New York City, or down the street to Kate's for quizzo.  But I got out of work late and opted for the library instead to get some more research for this NYU essay.  I could have, and would have walked, if it wasn't ten below outside and if Newark wasn't notorious for rapers and creepy guys.  The library is a half mile away and between my place and the library I passed two gruesome accidents.  This weekend, three teenagers died in nearby accidents.  Wasn't it just last week where Dan and I saw that car hit the pole as we were walking home from Kate's?

      Six years ago a friend from high school and I had decided that February 21st was the most perfect day of the year.  Everything was wonderful that day, and since then, all 21 days of each month are gauranteed to be fabulous and February 21st of each year was always looked forward to.    Green to Think, The Honorary Title, Wheat, and Hey Mercedes at the Mercury Lounge in New York City.  Enough said.  I pick up Dan and we went straight for the Wawa for the usual...caffeine, cash, food, gas.  That Wawa has been incident free for 213 days, whereas mine is still 69 days.  I think during the ride up we both fell in and out of sleep, he was worse off though since he had to work all day and he slept sitting up.  Brand New carried us into the city though we sat at the Holland Tunnel for like 25 minutes.  We were just in the same area a few days before for the Marlon Spike show at the Knitting Factory, so there was no drama with the driving, for the most part.    We go down a side street and I switch with Dan so that he can parallel park my car.  During which, Morita called me and passed me off to Steve so I could tell him where we were.  First off, Steve should know my issue with knowing where the hell I am.  I never get directions right and I never stay in one place, he should know that pinpointing where I am would not be a good idea.  So he keeps asking me...no wait - he YELLED AT ME :-P...where I was, but we were parking so all I could see if a billboard and not any signs.  Apparently he also put the phone down while I was talking.  So I finally get out of the car and tell him where we were and he yelled at me for being at the wrong place.  So we get in and drive to where we were supposed to be.  So its great that they called to find out where we were because they know me and my destination issues...but NO YELLING!!  Dan drives my car to the Merc and we found a perfect **free* parking spot right out front.  Chris meets us out front and we dodge traffic to get across the street to Nice Guy Eddie's for food and happy hour.  Buy one drink get one free - score.  Chris ordered a sandwich and it took about 40 minutes for it to arrive.  It was a Cuban sandwich, so it arrived on the boat, hence the lateness.  We were all throwing daggers at the waitress.  She kept getting sidetracked by the table next to us who were from England or Scotland or somewhere.  I kept staring at them listening to them talk, then inform Chris and Dan that if I had an accent, I would talk all the time just to hear myself.  Chris asked, "like you don't already?".  Hey now.  Which is when he told me about how mean Steve was by putting down the phone while I was talking.  Basketball was on and we were talking about St. Joe's bball.  I told them that I used to play basketball and was center.  They look at me as if I was crazy since I am a whopping 5'3'' - but I used to be taller then everyone else when I was younger, I just stopped growing haha.  Dan: "If Marlon Spike was a basketball team, I'd be center.  Well, we'd need an extra player too."    We get the bill and pay for our food.  Dan busted out his wallet, and I noticed it was in two pieces.  Chris asked why he doesn't carry just half of his wallet, but Dan needs somewhere to carry his student IDs.  His one is practically rubbed off and all you can see is a glowing aura.  Chris said it was the man who wasn't there.  It took about 5 minutes, but we completely counted the change.  Off to the Merc!  The show was sold out before the doors even opened.  Get inside and see everyone around the bar.  So awesome to see everyone again, lets see...it was (because these names will come up again, so I will do it all at once) - Dan, Chris Morita (have to clarify since there are 80 Chris's), Jodie, Ken, Maryellen, Gilligan, Dareen, Dave, DeRose, Katie, Sarah, and Amy.  Oh yeah, and mean Steve.  :-)  It was cute, they all said they were worried I wouldn't make it haha.  I informed Steve on his meanness and he laughed and I didn't.  Dan spotted that Pabst was on tap and that was the greatest thing at that moment so we took a picture to document the occassion.  He couldn't drink the PBR draft, so we got other liquid fun instead.    Green to Think was about to take the stage so we all moved from the bar to the venue.  I have a tendency to stand centerish leftish, usually between the singer and lead guitar during shows when I have a choice on where to stand, but Dan opted for in front of Chris the bassist.  Shit -- too many Chris's.  I told him that centerish rightish wasn't as exciting because Chris doesn't move, but on occassion he'll wiggle.  Dan laughed and he remembered how excited Maryellen, Dareen, and I were in Philly when Chris actually got his move on.  There were some sound issues in the beginning, but by the second song, it was mostly figured out.  The last show I saw them play was in Decemeber, but I don't count that since I missed some of it and I was trapped in a sea of teenagers.  But the show at the Merc was awesome.  Such a talented and great band.  I don't get to see them perform that often and the performances I do see are either short opening acts, or at places like Desmonds, or acoustic stuff.  So I guess the last full on GTT rock show that I saw was the one at Philly.  Hmmm...  But yeah, back to the subject.  The show was energetic and the new songs sounded awesome and they keep getting better.  Kenny always makes me smile because he stands up alot while he plays.  (He's the drummer).  Dave is rocking out with his legs spread open and I started laughing because it reminded me of the Dewey festival last April.  I realized I was laughing to myself at the show and Dareen was behind me so we laughed together.  Then they played Sundays, yay.  So then I scamper to Maryellen.  Let's see, what else was played...1-2-3, We Are Stars, Rockin', Nineteen, And You Dream, a new song (the third song on the setlist), I Don't Think She'll Ever Let Me Be, hmmmm anything else?  Steve had some interesting segways between the songs.  And he swore on stage when he couldn't get his guitar strap on. Hehe.  Strap on. Anyways...  The Honorary Title came on next.  So good.  This was one show where every single band was extremely talented and each brought something unique to the stage.  Dan mentioned how reminiscent they were of Bright Eyes, so I liked.  I don't remember much about their set aside from the fact that I liked it because I had to pee a lot since I drank a lot of beer.  I kept meeting Katie in the bathroom, so it was ok.  Dan said he had to buy their CD and I agreed with him.  He also got hooked up since he helped carry their keyboard off of the stage.  Chris mentioned he was bloated from the Guinness and I was afraid that he ight have exploded.  Maryellen and I also made fun of the woman next to has who was wearing a zebra shirt, a mini back pack, and a scrunchie.  Dude.  WHEAT!! WOOOOO!!!!  Have I mentioned how much I love Wheat before?  I have to thank Ryan for getting me into this band a while ago.  Their new CD is amazing.  Everyone came back up for this portion of the night and we were all front and center.  And of course Maryellen and I were the dorks who sang along to every word.  So the lead singer of Wheat has a staring problem.  No wait, its not a problem.  But damn, he was fixated on the front for the WHOLE DAMN SHOW.  We all kept hitting each other, like "is this really happening?".  Not that we are new to this whole thing, but it was WHEAT!  I was so into this set.  Of course when they played Closer to Mercury I turn to Dave and ask if this is the song he doesn't like.  Of course it gets quiet when I say that.  ARGH!  They also played "don't i hold you" and I was smitten.    Heeeeeeeyyyy Mercedes were the last to play and the highlight of Dan's night.  Of course we didn't move and Dan, Chris, and I were right in front of the stage.  Dan, Tanya, and I had listened to both of their albums on the way to NYC the Monday before and I had played "Lets Go Blue" on my radio show on Friday, and I know thats Dan's favorite song of theirs, so of course we shouted it out.  Their performance was awesome.  The set flew by and it was great to sing and dance to, and looking around, I think Dan and I were the most into it.  We kept shouting out and they said that that was not the right answer, and they played it. Woohoo.  They told Dan later that they haven't played that song in months, that rocks.  Hang out for a bit after.  Steve told me to hold on because he needed his ear plugs to talk to me because I am a loud mouth.  That was mean comment #496 from him that night.  I am a very quiet person.  I was just excited, and the venue was loud.  It wasn't me at all.  He also bought a kids shirt.  This part gets choppy because that is how I remember it.  Dan went to get a shirt as well and hands his jacket to Maryellen in which she exclaims "i'm holding marlon spike coat, i'm holding marlon spike coat!".  It was humorous :-).  Talking talking talking...then we leave.  Next thing I know Maryellen has my keys and we leave for Hoboken with Amy and we talk about fashion in the backseat.    Go to bed sometime and wake up at 7:30 am.  Ugh.  Dan and I hit up the Dunkin Donuts and discover that the egg and cheese sandwich is $.99 and that was the perfect breakfast meal when you have only slept a few hours and you are about to drive some more.  I got from exit 14C to 1 in an hour.  I was so sleepy that I think my foot just fell on the pedal.  We listened to the Postal Service and Dan mentioned how it sounded like getting coins in a video game.  I am sure I will add more later.  But for now, I am tired.  And cold.  My heat isn't on again.

      "Give me Friday night apartments with red-faced tears of laughter. Jumping up and down, drinking happy ever-after Build a wall of good people and you can't beat a young man's pride So I'll be one of them, I'll be one of them this time." rb  Aurora and I were going to see Ryan play at the Point, but nooooo it sold out before we got our tickets.  It all worked out though because there was plenty to do in DE.  I was talking to Michelle, Tim, Chris, Derek, Dan, and Tanya and before I could even tell Aurora how we weren't going to Manayunk, the evenings plans were made.  Before heading out, I met up with Rainbow Chris behind the store.  So much drama happens in that lot, from throwing furniture to people throwing up to arguments to rejoicing and this time we tried to sort some things out.  Chris is a great person to talk to and because we work so much together and gripe about similar things, it helps to bounce stuff off of him.  Its hard for me to trust people, and its the same with him, so I am glad that we're both around for each other during this very odd time we found ourselves in.  I apologize for the vagueness, but that is how its going to be until some things get settled and so I can protect the innocent and not so innocent.  Obviously a lot has been on my mind, the past few weeks have found me in some odd circumstances.  I've learned a lot about some friends of mine and it ways heavy on the soul.    I haven't had a chance to hang out with Tim in a while, though I have been seeing more of Nina lately since she has been stopping in the store.  She told me about how they are going out to celebrate at Iron Hill so I went there first.  Jason and Michelle were also there and it was great to see them again.  Even though Jason just watched the basketball game while we all talked nonstop.  Michelle is enjoying Drexel a lot more this semester, so I am glad she decided to stick it out for another semester.  You should also pick up the latest copy of the Bystander (a monthly DE mag), Michelle's articles in there are always intriguing! :-)  "Like eating jello with a knife." -tanya, on certain circumstances...  Left Iron Hill around midnight and went to meet up with Tanya, Chris, Dan, & Ali at the Logan House.  Milo Z was performing and it was definitely awesome.  Guaranteed to make you dance.  So Tanya and I took some shots, I say shots plural because the bartender hooked us up and gave us like 3, and danced away.  Chris enjoyed some Jameson and Dan was served a tasty concoction of coke and vanilla goodness.  Ali, Tanya, and I pulled out the save me card a few times with the skeevy guys around.  Seriously now - stop it.  Shawn was having a party at his place, so we leave the LH around 1 and head to Newark.    Ali, Dan, and I park at Pearson and see some interesting guys in the lot with some nitro.  They said something that was funny, but I can't remember what it is now, but laugh anyways.  Another packed house at 137 and we find our way into the kitchen.  Dan told me he was going to get me a drink, so Derek prompted him to get the um...Drunk Turtle?  Green Turtle...?  Something Turtle.  Dan comes back with two cups filled to the brim with a neon green beverage.  It reminded me of the Hi-C Ecto Cooler drink fifteen years ago.  But it was tasty and we all know that that is all that matters.  Derek wasn't drinking because he has been sick for weeks and everything on the full length is done except for his vocals - I am sure if he had a cup of the ectobooze, it would kill any infection he has in his system.    I went up to the second floor to go to the bathroom and come out and meet these people in the hallways.  So then it was decided that we'd shotgun Keystone.  Yeah, I am so not good at that and made a mess.  So Dan got us another round of ectobooze, this time much stronger than the last and though my cup was strong, his made my mouth numb.  Tanya and Chris show up shortly after to join in on the kitchen festivities.  I met someone else and we talked about stuff that I can't remember now, I just remember we were blocking the fridge.    Haha, I just asked Tanya if anything noteworthy happened at the party and all she said was "ectobooze". Hahaha.    Then we went to the diner.  But we denied our usual Eagle Diner outing for the Korner Diner because it was only two blocks away and we could walk to it.  We get a table for ten and cause a ruckus in the corner of the Korner.  Dan got his miscellaneous sauce, chocolate chip pancakes were had, and Jenna and I split some fries because that is the best food ever at 4 am.  Dan busted his cell phone and apparently it was "the black thing" that was somewhere on the floor.  Which was the antenna, but "black thing" is the technological term.  Our waitress...or waiter...?  I can't remember if it was a guy or girl, wasn't as awesome as our Eagle one either.    We leave and head over to Ali's because she lives across the street.  So Tanya has this red jacket.  And Chris wore the red jacket.  I can't even describe it.  He even struck a pose in this sexy red jacket.  I think we were all speechless because it was great.  Dan and I later wondered how long he has been waiting to seize the opportunity to wear the fuzzy warmness that is the red jacket.  We find Ali's Felicity DVDs and put in the first show.  I think we made it through one show before we all crashed.  I live a block away so I just went home to my own bed since that sounded a lot better then sleeping sitting up on a couch.  Did that a few weekends ago and it was amazingly comfortable, or not.

      I don't usually get nervous for my radio show, but on Friday, I was on edge.  Ryan Montbleau was going to stop on by for some songs and to chat on air.  I have interviewed dozens of musicians and have been broadcasting on the radio for over two years, but I was jittery this time because I have a deep respect for Ryan and think he is amazingly talented and I didn't want to screw anything up.  His music is incredible and more people need to hear it.  Their lives will become better.  :-)  The only other time I was this nervous was when I interviewed Teitur, but Marissa didn't give me enough time to be nervous ;-).    Ryan arrived at the station a little before three and the last hour of my show flew by.  He is so easy to talk to and has so many intriguing stories that it made for a good show.  And I actually remembered to sleep the night before, so I didn't make as many stupid mistakes as I usually do.  Just technological ones.    Ryan played Honeymoon Eyes, Variety, Stretch, and Just Perfect and by the amount of phone calls I received during the show, I assume it sounded great over the air waves.  In his spare time he enjoys drinking tea and walking.  I was almost a dumbass when I almost said "i like tea too".  Haha, my friends tease me because I have like 8 boxes of different types of tea on my counter on any given day.  But I didn't, it was just what I thought of.    I'll listen to the mini disc this week and update you on the interesting parts of the interview so you can see why I think he is an amazing musician.

      "People always come and people always go, some run scared some never ever know this I tell you cause this I know, they leave footprints all over your soul"  I was all set to actually get some sleep on Thursday after spending another long day at the record store.  But nope, Dan texted me to see if I wanted to head over to the Scrounge with him and Tanya and so I knew I wasn't staying in that night.  We got there during Stepanian's set and found a place in the back.  It was odd, sitting there watching them reminded me so much of spring of freshman year and just everything that came out of that.  From intimate Howie Day shows to Derek and his current projects to Brew Haha and beyond.  I looked over at Tanya and Dan, who was fervishly writing on his stack of CD-Rs and I smile, not because of the music thats playing, but because of where I am now.  And how much greater now is than in years past.  Derek stopped down to see some of the show after acapella finished.  I was surprised he showed up, especially after Stepanian pretty much dicked them over.  During the whole set Dan thought of other songs that Stepanian's hinted at, or were a blatant rip off of.  It was a pretty amusing game.  After Dan handed out some CDs, we headed over to the Deer Park for some beer and food and conversation.

      hahahaha so Maryellen just sent me her results and we got the same damn thing (it was longer than what i posted) but she got the "pretty boy" one as well.  We agree that its all about the hair haha.  So eerily funny.  But all in all gross because they were heinous.  We're laughing, so I figured I would share it with you.

      I escaped from the record store for a bit to bother coffee shop Chris at the um...coffee shop.  I got a carmel latte and he hooked me up with 4 espresso shots in it.  He told me that he didn't want to be there with me when I started throwing up from all of the caffeine.  I needed it though, I thought I was going to pass out.  But now my heart is beating rapid fast and if I am not typing, my fingers are shaking.

      Chris M. sent Maryellen and I this test, so we're taking it now...  the sucker took forever to fill out, and most of the victims were heinous, but here are the results since I promised I'd post them...  Favorite Looks One of the "looks" that you consistently noticed has been described as "The Boy Next Door." He has an open face, with big eyes, and a big grin. He has a youthful or boyish quality that will follow him throughout his life. Typically this look is associated with light brown hair, a close shave, and blue or hazel eyes. These guys convey a warm, trusting impression, but watch out for that mischievous side! Our studies find that about 1 in 5 women (18%) are especially attracted to this youthful look.  Many of the features you found attractive are common among men described as "Mediterranean Hotties." Their olive complexions and dark hair make them hard to resist. You especially liked the handsome, yet warm and approachable looking men with these features. Men from Italian, Greek, or Continental Spanish descent are popular among over 40% of women.  Favorite Face Type Faces known scientifically as "Ecto-Mesomorphs" repeatedly caught your eye. Men express this type in two ways. One version has a rectangular face shape that is long and narrow. The other type's face shape is often compared to a diamond, because it is wide at the cheeks and then has a sharply angled jaw. All Ecto-Mesomorph men have striking chins that are prominent and squared-off with a crisp line at the base. This is one of the most idealized male face types and can be found on most movie and music idols.   Music idols.  So damn funny.  And it caught my penchant for Italian boys.  That was entertaining :-P.

      Hahaha so I was reading Brit's blog...sorry, XANGA...and she put up a picture that Whitney, Liz, Jen, she, and I drew together while pulling an all nighter before the COMM 370 final last year.  At least we had pancakes to counteract our insanity.  Ew, I just remembered how I got up from studying and walked to the studio from Kent at like 4:30 in the morning just to program STN.  Jen understands that pain!  But I am going to steal Britney and take her to a beach :-).  She says this and I agree... "i'd rather have a moment of fleeting happiness with you than never experience it at all..."  But Brit...remember this... "If it is in your soul to do it, then fate will just take you there.  And everything else was just a test, to see if you're the real thing."  Sit back and enjoy the ride.

      My friends are so amazingly talented and strong.  I am so fortunate to be surrounded by such wonderful people and consider myself lucky.  And perhaps it is because I assimilate myself around super intelligent and/or gifted people regardless of their craft - whether it be art, athletics, music, etc - because that is who I have been around and associated with for most of my life.  We understand each other.  Kinda like in high school, where you have the cliques of the kids who involved themselves in various things, and those who just went.  Life is like that.  Its the same now, most of my friends are tremendous musicians, artisans, and pro or almost pro equestrians.  We have the same forward mindset.  In addition to being extremely skilled, my friends are incredibly strong.  We're used to adversity and overcoming obstacles without a guise of hesistation, its how we do.  What I am leading towards is... I recently found out that one of my most beautiful artist friend was raped a few years ago.  She is so confident and carries herself with such an admirable flair.  While talking recently, she told me about her past.  Don't worry, I'm not breaching any code of confidence.  But it just amazed me on how she dealt with it and how it helped her become who she is today.  Granted it does still haunt her, but she shows no sign of weakness or having that unfortunate event block her from anything.  Good for her and I smile to know that I am friends with one of the strongest girls I've encountered.  Just another person kicking a challenge in the face and prevailing.

      Monday morning, while talking with Maryellen, she mentioned how she had Monday and Tuesday off.  She joked that she should come down to Delaware to hang out, so that idea snowballed and it was decided that she would spend her Monday evening Newark style.  :-)  Maryellen is an awesome person to talk to and dance with and complain to :-).  Anywhere from granny panties to drunken text messages to American Idol - we've almost hit it all so I was extremely excited that she was coming down to hang out.  :-)    I was at work all day and night so she met up with me afterwards where we immediately became giddy little girls haha.  Chris came over and then we were off to Kate's to meet up with Dan.  Funny, as soon as we walked into Kate's we saw Anthony and Jason, who I haven't seen since the old Sallies days sophomore year.  Awesome.    Grab a table and a pitcher upstairs and tore Chris's credit card to pieces.  Literally.  Though we got a lot right, we did not come anywhere close to winning Quizzo.  But at least Marlon Spike got plugged and we had nachos, both of which you can never deny.    We talk about my blog and I inform them that I don't say anything too blatant in here because I am pretty much a wuss.  And when you have one of the shyest people ever having a blog, you don't get too much out of me.  Muahaha, but that can change, or not.  They said I haven't written anything too bad or exposiing, of course except for the red jacket.  But see, I am trying to protect the innocent...or myself!  Maryellen was amazed at the cheapness of the pitchers.  And of course no tax, which is always great.  Wasn't as crowded as previous Mondays, but still fun.  Andrew came out so we didn't need to call him a douchebag or call his cell phone eight hundred times.  Chris yawned a lot and wasn't as animated as usual, so I had to call him out on it :-).  Dan called out of work so he could go to Quizzo and use Tuesday to do school work instead of the other way around, Maryellen already called out, and then Chris decided that instead of taking a half day he just wasn't going to go in.  Damn them, I had to work all damn day today!  Dan and Maryellen felt the need to play the hunting game after Quizzo.  I think Maryellen kicked his ass, but I may be mistaken...

      I scored tickets to 38 Special and Lynyrd Skynyrd at the Bob on Sunday.  I have never seen so many leather jackets and mullets in one place before.  Scary!!  I went with some horsey people and my mom, so it was interesting.  While waiting on people, I saw Dave Balseiro in the parking lot so my mom and I caught up with him for a little bit.  Strange, now that I think about it, I think I have known him the longest out of everyone I still talk to.  Wow.  Almost ten years!    I snuck in vodka and my camera past the pat down guys and proceeded to watch the show from some not good seats.  The seats weren't bad, but the view was odd.  So we see an open 2nd row and just go down there and act confident.  That lasted for a few songs till we got caught so we just went to another section in the front.  I thought 38 Special was better than Lynyrd Skynryd.  Not that I really know their music, but the performance was a lot better.    So it was rock and roll, but I have seen better shows.  Definitely not worth what a lot of people paid for the tickets.  And my mom who was tipsy was hilarious.  She kept saying stuff she shouldn't have been saying.  Such as "wal-mart must have closed early..."  Not too bright to say in front of the biker men with Confederate flag bandanas.  But I did get to hear Freebird live and the homage they did to the brother was great.  But yeah, that was the best part of the show.  Its was good, I have just seen better.  :-)

      Aurora and I hung out on Saturday night contemplating and scheming.  Spring Break 2004 needs a name.  Last year was good because SB '03 rhymed.  I am thinking of something that contains the word "tour" with "four".  March is already going to be an incredible month, but the end will be explosive.  I can't even imagine what's going to happen.  Here's how it looks, and if you want to join in on any of the festivities, please do.  Friday March 19 - WVUD show, then Wawa for the usual and heading up to NYC to meet up with Mark and perhaps see Megg if the timing is right.  Maybe sleep in the area, maybe head to Maine, you know how we do.  Saturday March 20 - University of Maine to hang out with Meg, then to Portland to see Ryan Montbleau play at the Ale House.  Sunday March 21 - Down to Boston, with a stop in New Hampshire, to see the cities and pick up Lloyd Dobler Effect.  Monday March 22 - Off to the Wobbly Barn for some snow fun and LDE show resort style in Killington, VT.  Tuesday March 23 - Same as above.  Wednesday March 24 - Back to Boston.  Thursday March 25 - Boston.  Friday March 26 - Lloyd Dobler Effect & Carbondale at Northeastern University, Boston  Saturday March 27 - Lloyd Dobler Effect shows Ivy League how to rock.  Princeton, NJ.  Weren't we here last Spring break?  Or Ryan Montbleau in Allston, MA.  Uh oh - scheduling conflict!!  Sunday March 28 - Newark, DE.   All in all, just from city to city, will be 1230 miles.  GAME ON.

      If you read the blog about the day before the in-store... I went to bed nearly deaf at 4:30 am and woke up at 8:30.  This is the fourth day in a row of me doing this, so of course I was pretty damn cranky.    Opened up the store with Raf and Charise and spent most of the morning drowned in coffee and running and jumping off of the stairs.  Oh!  And I used a drill in reverse and it was the coolest thing at the moment.  The customers found it amusing that I was really excited about it, but again at 11 am in the morning you're pretty damn wacky on 4 four hours of sleep.  Dan came to set up a little after noon and told me about their adventures with lesbians the night before.  Chris, Todd, and Sark came shortly after.    Marlon Spike performed for Rainbow Records first in-store performance (in um...building 54) because they are badass like that.  The turnout was good, but still not as many as the usual Saturday brings in.  It was extremely nice out, which pretty much explains it.  But it still filled up pretty nicely and it was fun seeing everyone.  It sounded really good and it was a decent performance.  Sark would randomly walk up to where Raf and I were and just hang out, it was funny.  I think it was about an hour and a half all in all.  Again, I was really tired so I am not sure.  I asked them to play Jade, and they did, and it was enjoyable.    So funny, I was talking to Marissa and introduced her to Raf and told Raf she was a music guru.  He left and Marissa told me how she went up asking Raf where Norah Jones was because she was looking in the N's and couldn't find it.  She so knew otherwise, but she got even less sleep than I did the night before, so it was excusable, so we explained her lack of music guruness at the moment to Raf and all was better.    They pack up and we head over to Kate's for lunch.  Oliver met us there and and much loud talking ensued.  Apparently the guy next to us was FAT though not GAY.  Again, this was fuzzy as well since I was so tired.  I do remember the Candian sign promoting customers to bring Kate's date for ale and tines.  I tried to defend the Rod Stewart show to Todd but I don't think he was having it.  We left and I don't even remember Oliver leaving.  Go upstairs and pass out till the nighttime.    urlLink In store pictures can be found here, thanks Maryanne for bringing her camera!

      4:30 am and I amd writing my essay - yes, still, there were some distractions - and I watched the  urlLink PMB short  of the making of Save Me again.  If you look closely at the front row on the third part of the video, you may see someone you recognize...   urlLink October 8th was nothing short of amazing .  Watching it again made me feel all the passion that was encompassed in that night.  And everything makes perfect sense.

      Aurora and I are here chilling in my apartment armed with Wawa.  Still 99 days incident free.  She's on the phone with Jackman and I nearly choked when she yelled "you don't know where you live?! Call your friends and ask them where you live!"  He said if he passes out he will call back.  Haha.  Aurora and I are not girlie girls and this is hilarious.  Most girls are like "awww..." when they hear the sweet stuff he says to her, but her and I --- "uh oh, he may read this"....ok, blog ended :-).

      Jamie makes me laugh because she is like me.  Last night in the car she puts on her glasses and says she doesn't usually wear them, but needs them at night and usually forgets them. We tried to read signs on the street and we couldn't.  I've been better about wearing my glasses when I need them, but ah, what's the fun in that?!

      Sunday morning was brutal.  Go to bed around 6am and wake up to Main Street noise at 9 am followed by my pillow over my head until after noon.    Spent the afternoon shopping, which is more like me returning things and finding and awesome pair of burgandy pants that I just couldn't pass up.  And groceries.  I was out to lunch when Mark called from NYC saying he enjoyed my messages last night.  I win.  I got way too many odd looks from the people around me eating.  Screw you and your boring lives.  ;-)  I wasn't loud, they shouldn't be eavesdropping on me, being on the cell phone is no different than talking to someone across from you.  Come back to the apartment and nap only to awaken to rain.  Groggily I pick up Aurora and we head to the East End.  Dan asked what time I was getting there.  I said 9ish, and he asked if my 9ish meant 9:30 or 11, LoPresto style.  We arrived at 9:30.  Before I left I told Maryellen that I wasn't going to drink until this weekend.  I was wrong, as soon as we got there, Dan got us beers.  Johnny Duke and the Aces opened up for West James and they were really good.  Lee didn't build them up too much, he is really talented. And he is only 15!  Very blues influenced.  Dan knocked into our table and caused a ruckus.  West James played and were decent.  their show improved as the night went on.  And Aurora said they kicked around a little Tribe.  Nice!  Sorry I am not as detailed, I was way tired.  I didn't know Chris was coming, so when he came into the EE, I looked at Dan and asked what time it was.  10:59, almost on cue, mimicking our earlier conversation.  He was wearing a yellow shirt, so I asked Aurora if she wants to bet that he is wearing the super sexy cashmere socks.  I win - he was.  And the fact that he had to point them out was fabulous.  The East End fixed the paper towel machine that Aurora broke months ago.  Sunday was fun - yay.

      Saturday.  My God, SATURDAY.  I have no idea where to begin, there is just so much to write about.  I will just bypass the importance of PMB to me, and save that for another blog when I have nothing else to right about and I am actually caught up.  But for now...time to hit the road :-)  Aurora and I hit up Wawa for the usual.  She also picked up some Wawa tea because apparently she thought it sounded like it would mix well with whatever clear liquid was in the water bottle.  After she bought the tea, we smelled the bottle and it was definitely apple vodka.  This will prove interesting.  Time to hit up 896 to Amish country!  En route we listened to Johnathan Rice, Akiva, Lloyd Dobler Effect, and some other stuff that I can't remember.  As well as my swearing at the Mack truck in front of us and the horse and buggies.  So cruel.  We laughed the entire time and sped up for the huge railroad crossing hump and flew.  I almost took out a clan of Amish girls and we nearly peed ourselves.  Literally, I thought our bladders were going to burst.  A few detours later and we get to the Chameleon Club.  We stand outside in the freezing cold drinking our not so good apple vodka tea as I chatter away on Mark's voicemail.  Sidenote: Ok, lets talk about what a small world this is.  YEARS ago I saw this awesome band called the Excentrics open up for PMB.  It was actually one of the first bands I searched for when I first started working at Rainbow.  So when I met Mark, we were talking about music and that band came up and months later they played with the Excentrics, or The Getaway Car, as they are now named.  So Sept 21 (I remember dates) I saw Juliana Hatfield then went to see the Jonasay/Getaway Car show.  Mark introduced me to Todd Wright, the frontman for the Getaway Car.  Todd informs me that if we got married, my name would be Miranda Wright.  And that has stuck everytime he has seen me.  Ok, so yeah, back to the present.  Todd is now touring with PMB (talk about a perfect show!) on keys and backup vocals.  Mark visited me on Thursday and was talking to Todd while at my store.  Back to the Chameleon Club, I called Mark to see if Todd was going to be there in Lancaster and if he was if I could meet up with him to say hi.  So yeah, instead I just blabbered on Mark's v-mail outside in the cold.  We get inside and realize that its 18+ on the second floor and 21+ on the main floor.  What the hell.  So for the most part Aurora and I tried to scheme on how to get her down on the main level so we can sing and dance.  You have no idea.  So I text Morgan (Morgan is way cool and from Boston, he is mentioned in the Oct 8 blog.  We have known each other for like 5 years, but just met in person in October) to see if he has any ideas, because just like us, he is the master of being devious in venues.  He tells me he is drunk and the drunk bus will be arriving shortly from the hotel.  geez!  So I meet him and Ben and Katie downstairs and we drink.  22oz Yuengling bottles means that you are in heaven.  I think Morgan shed a tear at the bartender and told him that Lancaster was great.  Michael Tolcher opened and though I didn't feel him in the beginning the show grew on me and by the end of his performance, I really dug him.  Throughout the show I kept running up between the two levels and the guy in the kilt at the door kept laughing at me.  We deduced that the only way we could get her down was to grab someone with the band.  She saw J-Mo earlier, but he was doing guitar tech stuff on stage, so he was out.  I spotted Chardy so Morgan and I talked to him to see what he could do, but he couldn't do anything at this point.  Oh well, we have to respect that.  The Chameleon had an awesome sound system and a great setup.  And they had their shit together and at least Aurora and I can admire that after so many shitty venues we have dealt with while videotaping.  Ah, it was worth a try.  And I love Aurora because she understands my desire to be on the floor sometimes.  I was so elated and the show was just what I needed to compliment a great weekend.  The guys were on par and went beyond what I expected.  Not the greatest PMB show ever, but it satisfied my fix.  I think I was beaming the entire time, and it was amazing to see Todd play with them.  He is so freaking talented and its crazy how everything ties in together.  Morgan and I make our way closer to the stage.  We go nuts, singing louder than anyone else and exuding such passion and energy.  We pump our arms higher and harder and shout the loudest, because we have been there for years and we know what lies ahead and we couldn't be happier.  We yelled out "straight curve" (one of my favorite old school songs) and got "You & I" instead (my favorite new song) and I don't think my smile could have been larger.  Ecstaticness.  After the show I tell Aurora I will meet up with her outside and we chill on the floor waiting to hear what's next.  We took some pictures and hung out and I drank water.  Literally smacked into Pat, talked to John, and tried to find Todd through Chardy, but he had already left for Virginia.  Argh!  I didn't want to leave Aurora out there for too long, so it was decided that we would all reconvene at the hotel.  Here is what I had to go on: Morgan: you go down 30 Me: right or left Morgan: I don't know, 30. And go 5 or 7 miles.  Green sign. Sounds like Miranda directions!   Aurora and I head out and find a convenience mart.  I think I pulled an illegal turn, I have no idea, I have no idea how I was even driving at this point.  We go in and of course I am saddened that it is not a Wawa.  We order food, and I think Aurora had to even order it for me because I couldn't handle the touch screen ordering since I couldn't see straight.  I also dragged her back in to show her this monkey thing riding a horse thing and it looked so scandalous.  So we eat in the car and I lose half of my egg salad sandwich in my car.  Aurora ate the nastiest thing ever.  Chili cheese potato wedges.  So the night before I think I mentioned how Tim informed me of all these sexual terms.  One was called the "cleveland steamer".  I had no idea what that was, so I told Aurora it on the way down.  What she ordered looked like the Cleveland Steamer.  This is what you do not order.  We leave and I am followed by the police and I am scared.    If you recall Morgan's directions, you will realize that I have no idea where the hell I am going.  But alas, I navigated our way to a Wawa.  And we find the hotel.  So we sit in the parking lot in the back of the hotel at 2:45 in the morning.  Then we see the silver wonderfulness that is the PMB bus.  Ahhhhh.  We get on the bus and walk in on Pat serenading Morgan, Ben, Bones, J-Mo, John, Brian, Katie, Chardy, and now Aurora and me, and playing his acoustic guitar before busting a string.  I sober down on the bus while Aurora is still reveling in the vodka that she downed.  Pat shares with us most of the DVD that will be released on the new CD, it looks AMAZING.  I think a rubix cube was busted out.  We talk of Todd and Ghegan.  Lots of things on the DL that will not be blogged.  Sorry kids.  Funny, Bones (new PMB sound man, well newish, I know of the Paul days) tells me I look familiar, and he was from VA, so we talk about what we have in common in that area, and he mentions he thinks he knows of me from Jonasay.  Aw.  Blah blah blah, fun on the bus, then off the bus to head home.  We go to Wawa yet again because I definitely needed coffee since I haven't slept in a while and those back roads can be treacherous.  Aurora and I put on some bad radio and sing away, though I had already lost my voice.  And we smile because we're us.  "all about the passion..."

      After working at the record store I was all set to come home and crash with a movie.  Of course it never happens that way...  Tim texts me as soon as I walk in and as soon as I see its from him, I know I am going out.  Tim is an awesome person and I don't get to hang out with him enough because he has a real job that causes him to not stay out late and wake up early.  I head out the door and meet him and a few friends of his at Timothy's.  Ok, if you are an older guy, don't make comments as I walk past you at the bar because I can hear those comments and that does not make you look cool.  I swear, some people are creepy.  That was fun.  Yuengling is the beverage of choice and Tim and I just shoot the shit at the bar.  Nate calls and was at the Deer Park so I convince him to join us at Timothy's.  Nate is one of my best guy friends so it was fun hanging out with the two of them.  We were at the bar talking and the subject comes to sex, because Nate makes me laugh everytime when he explains his recent antics.  Apparently there is a lot of slang that my naive mind was not aware of.  So they inform me of such colorful vocabulary and phrases.  It was just funny because most girls would get offended at what they said, but I laugh because girls are dumb.  We watched the clown fish get it on with the coral and provided play by play commentary.  Chris calls around midnight, and soon him, Dan, and Tanya meet up with us at Timothy's.  In the meantime, Nate grabbed my phone and went through my phonebook calling people.  Of course he chose Aurora, Marissa, and Maryellen and we all chatted and passed the phone around.  Tanya was deeply enthralled with the fish tank.   We made her chug her beer, then we left.  Dan and Chris wouldn't let me drive my car, and reminded me of the Deer Park episode where I was going to drive Oliver's car but couldn't find the driver's door.  So Dan drives my car with his knees to my dashboard.    There is nothing better to do after last call than go to the Dunkin Donuts and Baskin Robbins that is across the street for some sugary goodness.  And there is definitely nothing better than Reese Peanut Butter Cup ice cream.  Tanya, Dan, Chris, and I go back to my place and watch MTV while Chris passes out on the futon in usual fashion.  :-)  This time without the red jacket. - NO WAIT!!!  Timothy's is slowly coming back to me!!! I remember while Tanya was in the bathroom, we noticed the bright interior to her jacket.  I don't recall what design it was, but it was bright.  And of course we pointed it out and Chris donned the jacket inside out in style.  It was awesome.  Unfortunately we didn't have a camera, but it was great haha.  And that was my Friday.  An evening full of great friends, good beer, and clown fish.

      Friday was the usual awesomeness that it generally is.  Evan, Ed, & Matt sat in with me during my radio show, and it went pretty well.  We played a lot of songs that will be on the upcoming album, as well as a few live tracks.  The "interview" was interesting as well.  And I can honestly say I have never been embarassed on air before until that broadcast.  And for me to say that after being the news anchor on STN and saying some pretty dumbass stuff is saying a lot!!  Towards the end of show, the guys asked if they can turn the interview around and ask me some questions.  Thinking I had nothing to lose, I say yes.  So then Evan asks if I am single.  This wouldn't be a big deal, but I have attracted some male stalkers via my radio show in recent months, so I stammered and tried to change the subject, not that I didn't want to give him an answer, I just didn't want to give an answer on air.  The mics are still on and I think it was Evan who asked what I look for in a drummer then says that Ed thought I was cute or was asking about me or something to that effect.  All on air.  I was so flustered that I forgot what was even said, I just put on some Fighting Gravity.  It wasn't them, it was just me not wanting to disclose that stuff on air and salvage some integrity with my show.  My face was so red.  Thankfully Maryellen called me at the studio and I cowered in the corner of the WVUD office embarrassed.  I didn't mean to offend anyone, I just was put in an odd position and didn't know what to do!  At least Maryellen made me feel better haha.

      One of the highlights to my every day is my jaunt to the coffee shop next door.  Not only are the coffee shop boys nice, they have the best soup ever.  And they make me shake with all of the extra espresso they put in my latte.  Even though I'm taunted when I bring in all of my various flyers and posters to place all over, they are still supercool.

      Before I begin posting about my winderfully awesome weekend, I will write about something else.  So I stumbled upon someone else's journal online and it oddly mimics mine.  Or not mine, but me.  So I feel compelled to read it every day.  Today she rote about Maroon 5 and Matt Nathanson, and I feel her pain - haha.    Here it goes, you can read about my  urlLink alter me .  Except that she isn't as wussy as I am about posting things.  It's freaking cold in my room.

      We get to the Balloon and they have us roped off like cattle.  So we got some beer and talked.  Tanya, Maryellen, and I had bathroom talks.  Those are different than in public talks.  I have to get to NY.  We get inside and say hi to people, and shortly after, Marlon Spike takes the stage - with a glowing leprochaun instead of Todd.  They played Jade first and I was content.  Tanya tried to get me to dance in the front with her, but I wasn't tipsy enough.  ;-).  Instead I jumped from cluster to cluster because I was so giddy and couldn't stay in one place.  Todd rocked Tanya's bunny glasses and I stole McDermott's hat.  I thought the performance was really good and I hate to say it, but I like the non-sax lineup of Marlon Spike.  Has a little bit more edge to it.  Dan did his bass spin and didn't hit anything or mess it.  He was wireless and tore up the stage.    Jen and I ran into the bathroom and something was exciting, though right now I don't remember what it is.  But we squealed and planned out more premium malt beverages.  I noticed a sign in the bathroom saying how guys weren't allowed to wear white shirts.  Steve was, so I tried to steal it but that duct tape was not coming off.  The burly bear sticker is still plastered to the tampon machine.  It is absolutely crucial that Jen and I are in front and dancing to IKE.  Reminds us of a certain day in Septemeber when we danced in the rain in Baltimore.  :-)  John and I had the same outfit on, and I told him of the necessity that was Welcome Home.  And they started off the show with it, nice.  So we danced and sang like silly girls and it was fun.  Of course some of the time was spent running around the venue talking to people.  Michael tried to teach me how to dance.  I embrace my white girl groove.  I know I can't dance haha.  Chris and Dan joined us in the front for Devil's Diary and Deathbed and it was great.    Steve, Morita, and Maryellen came down the steps to hang out with us in the front for Omnisoul.  Omnisoul is such a great band, more on them later, I am pressed for time.  They had sound issues in the beginning.  But by the third song I think it sounded ok.  They played a lot of new stuff and blew everyone away with Paranoid Android.  That song cannot leave the set ever.  I kept nudging everyone around me, saying how great the song of the moment was.  Jen was smiles.  Chris came up to me before The Greater You and I told him how the song will be their last song.  This song is amazing and Chris does a beautiful rendition of it.  So he was like " i am going on stage for it!"  Ok no...  So tuning time was spent trying to get Chris not to go on stage.  He had his time to shine!  So we sang and danced instead.    Talked to the IKE guys after the show and Steve made his way to the merch table where I think I stuffed him full of free stickers and promo.    Stumbled back to my place for the post show festivities.  The place was packed and the CDs kept skipping.  Aurora and Jackman made it, as did Marissa, Amanda, and Meg.  It all blurs together, I don't know how the hours flew by.  Todd and Dan kept giving me jello shots.  Oh, I remember throwing things from my window.  I have a problem babbling to people I don't know so they feel comfortable, so I did that a lot.  Lord knows what I said.  John Faye made it and that was the greatest thing ever haha.  I remember telling some girl she had the same jacket as he, but she may have thought I was crazy and nodded anyway.  Tanya owned my papason and no one fell.    Then I crashed.

      i love charise becuase she is just like me.  we can talk for hours about the same thing and totally understand.  from admiring boys' hair, going far far away, agreeing that she would have written the email too, unhippies - she gets it.  and this recent quote still makes me smile :-) "move over pesto, diet cherry coke is my new favorite thing!"

      Like i said in my previous blog, I arrived to work 5 minutes late riding on 4 hours of sleep.  I definitely was not functioning right and the only pick me up I had was a visit next door to the coffee shop for soup and tea.  John Faye and Cliff Hillis, of  urlLink IKE , arrived around 12:30 and I was instantly rejuvenated.  Their in-store performance lasted about an hour and it was fantastic.  It sounded great and the store was absolutely packed.  John asked me if it was too loud.  I said no, I like my music loud and to feel free to break the windows.  Newark Geroge made an appearance, and Cliff told him to have fun.  It was interesting.  They played Welcome Home for me, which of course is the anthem for the girlies.  A very very good Saturday afternoon, but only a part of the wonderfulness that was the weekend.  Fueled only on good vibes I was able tor un some errands and clean before picking up Tanya.  We came back and were very antsy and played around on AIM and got ready.  Dan brought the PBR and pizza and all was well.  Shortly after Dan went to the venue to set up his bass stuff, Steve, Maryellen, and Morita came, followed by Michael and Chris and a girl whose name I forgot by now.  Then John, Matt, and Brian.  I think I got those names right.  Mike or Matt.  Argh.  So we chatted and ate and drank.  Michael came in with a green lighted leprechaun and I knew it was LoPresto's.  Apparently every year his family gets together for St. Patrick's Day.  Interesting.  Though tonight I think our festivities include McGlynns and perhaps some car bombs.  I wonder if the leprochaun will attend.  Steve, Morita, and I went downstairs to check out some music, bother Charise, and grab some more booze.  I was in a really giddy mood, so it was enjoyable.  Charise and I sprawled ourselves on the floor talking while the boys perused the discs.    Came back to hang out some more and I was greeted by Tanya with Chris on the phone.  He was looking for an adapter that I randomly found in a bag in my closet.  So he jogged up from the venue and we all left for the Balloon.  But I have to leave for work, so I will finish this later. :-)

      I figured I would dedicate a little time to the blogger this evening before tuckering out.  Chris, Dan, and I arrive at the Farside shortly after the open bar started, and we dove right in.  Even though it took me an hour to nurse my Guinness, and I was made fun of the entire time, I quickly downed the rum and cokes that were to follow.  We danced around to Morita's mix CDs and played with the noise maker blower things.  It was a pretty jubilant night, everyone was in high spirits.  Maryellen was giving out stickers and left me in charge of them as she scampered off.  Big mistake.  If you  urlLink look at the pictures , you will notice that everyone was left defenseless.  I made stickman designs on LoPresto, Dan, Aimee, and Kylie.  It was a work of art.  Hmmmmm.  Some guy yelled at me for going into the guys restroom.  I didn't realize where the hell I was, oh well.  Steve came and I tried to get him and Chris to make out.  I hang my head in shame now, I can't believe I did that.  Oh it was fun.  But come on, how hot would that have been?  I am sure Steve was mean to me at some point in the evening, even though I do give him credit for showing up...but I can't recall if he was or not.  I remember sitting on a stool with Chris because I could barely stand and I told him my darkest secret ever.  Hopefully he was drunk enough to forget.  So scandalous.  We leave the bar after closing and stumble for a million blocks to Maryellen's apartment.  When its minus three degrees, drunk, and carrying a bunch of stuff, the walk is treacherous.  We get to her place and I realize I brought the wrong pump for the air mattress, but we were only sleeping for a few hours, so it didn't even matter.  I remember tripping over Morita, who was already asleep, a bunch of times trying to orient myself.  Dan crashed stomach first and ended up staying like that the whole night.  I remember talking to Chris then drifting off eventually.  Only to be awaken by the incessant cell phone at 7am.    We groggily walk to the car in the cold a very very very far distance away.  We meet Chris's friend Michael at Dunkin Donuts, which is now becoming a NYC/Hoboken tradition, and partook in the 99 cent breakfast sandwich special.  The 130 mile ride to DE at 7 am was extremely awesome.  The worst part was driving and I think I still may have been drunk from the night before.  But I was entertained by the backseat stories and Jamiroquai and Sting.   Had to be at work at 10, roll in at 10:05.  Nice.

      This past weekend was absolutely amazing and Friday couldn't come fast enough.  Started off the day at the record store then off to WVUD.  Chris and Derek sat in with me to help promote the show on Saturday.  Chris brought his keyboard and invaded the airwaves.  He and Derek performed The Greater You and it sounded great.  Derek talked about money a lot, and Chris mentioned Sting's virility.  Fun times.  I'll mention more about that later.    Off to Hoboken for Maryellen's birthday bash!  Chris sat in my passenger seat and noticed that the heated seats were on.  So he had the bright idea of turning it on way up when we picked up Dan.  At Dan's we evealuated the CDs and iPods in tow and we also had the option of the radio.  I made a comment saying that no matter what, we won't be riding in silence since we will have some type of music available for the 2 hour trip.  Dan noticed when he got in, but of course Chris and I pleaded ignorance.  Our seats were perfectly fine.  I told Dan he broke my seat.  Dan tried to use my cassette player to hook up Chris's minidisc player so we could listen to the WVUD show from earlier and ended up locking my stereo system.  I was not being serious when I talked about riding in silence a few minutes earlier!  I blamed him for breaking that as well as my seats.  He ended up fixing it though after Wawa so the drama didn't last long - until we got gas.  Riding along 95 listening to something Chris had on his iPod that will now give me nightmares, and my car lurches and stutters as the RPM goes sky high and then I had no gas.  This happened a few times and I pull on the side of the road and panic.  Since Dan already broke my seat and stereo, I blame him for this as well.  Just kidding.  We smell gas and Chris mentions it could be the gas line.  So we brave the roads again and I go on a back road and I guess my car got its problem out of its system, but still it didn't need to happen!  I am no longer an EZ Pass virgin.  Chris exclaimed that if one person should have EZ Pass, it should be me.  Yeah, the reason I don't have EZ Pass is because I have $-5.34 in my checking account!  Chris fell asleep in the back as Dan and I navigated through Jersey City cutting across multiple lanes.   I am the worst at parallel parking, as most have witnessed, so I hop out and have Chris drive my car.  He finds an excellent spot.  We find a quick an easy food place.  Chris and I eat the green pizza.  Not sure what was on it, it was green.  Because the more food we eat, the more our bodies will love us at the open bar.  But my poptarts are done and I have to be at Rainbow in 15 minutes, so I will start part 2 of Friday night sometime at work.  Enjoy.  This reminds me of a quote from one of the best movies of the 90's:  "Now, I'm sitting in class enjoying a late breakfast when out of all the classrooms in the school, she walks into mine! And where does the teacher sit her? Right next to me! Up until now, one could write this off to coincidence. But then she reaches in her bag and pulls out a strawberry Pop-Tart - the very same breakfast pastry I was consuming at that moment! What was I to do? How was I to proceed? "

      Why do I wake up to snow and ice and cold?!  Why why why, especially when yesterday was such a gorgeous day!??!  I own two umbrellas and they were both in my car, so why walk 4 blocks to the tv studio when you can drive :-).  The only reason I am blogging my morning is because Jen and I had the craziest conversation.  She came in as I was writing her and looked extremely tired.  Damn filming in the snow with 4 hours of sleep - poor girl's eyes were blood shot!  So we complained about the cold and wondered why.  Then I informed her of a conversation I had with a guy and again, we ponder why.   And at 9:30 in the morning with the two of us having minimal sleep, this was pretty damn funny because I was at a loss for words... "So he asked me to do something with him, why does this happen?  Number one, no.  Number two...NO!"  Shortly after I left to go to Wawa and I hit a car.  Nothing major, I just scraped it.  But still.  Who knows what the rest of the day will bring.

      This little thing is making its way around blogger and I guess I will partake since it was sent to me about 83 times...  and its a lot better than finishing up all the correspondence I have piling up.  Ahhh...procrastination at its finest :-)   1. What was the last song you heard? Cannonball by Damien Rice.  I drove to the tv studio and back, which is a perfect drive for one song each way.  I have to be mega selective and it was the best song in my car at the moment.  It's almost excrutiatingly painful to know that something this beautiful exists in the world.  2. What were the last two movies you saw? In the theatre, it would have to be Mona Lisa Smile (on Christmas 2003) and Catch Me If You Can (Christmas 2002).  I don't go to the movies that much.  I thought I caught an independent film in philly during the summer, but apparently it wasn't too memorable.   On DVD - A Mighty Wind and Finding Nemo.  Obviously I rule at movie watching.  3. What were the last three things you purchased? Sharpie markers and folders for the tv station, potato pizza for dinner  4. What four things do you need to do this weekend? hehehehe....buy a digital camera, drive to NYC, drive to Maine, drive to Boston.  My weekend is going to be better than yours.  I could show you, but I'd have to charge.  5. Who are the last five people you talked to? Aurora, Epler, Maryann, Jim, Jamie

      In addition to this week being a whirlwind of anticipated activity, I was also surprised by a phone call.    STN changed my life.  If it wasnt for that station and Center Stage, I would definitely not be where I am today in regards to a lot of aspects, specifically school, work, and friendships not to mention the craziest memories one could imagine.  STN also made me a stronger person and whoever is reading this from STN is sure to agree.  I learned that not everything works the way it should and that gaff tape solves everything.  I couldn't stay awake to read for class but I could edit throughout the night on any given day.  On the eve of my most important test of the class I was in danger of failing that could push me up to a B, going to North Carolina to film surely outweighed anything I would learn in Philosophy.  If it was rainy outside I would debate not going to class, whereas for practically two years it rained or snowed during every single Center Stage show but we sloshed it out in style.    Without STN, there would have been no Dewey or Harrisburg.  I wouldn't have met half the bands I know now.   I wouldn't have gotten mono.  I probably wouldn't drink as much.  My stress level would be way different.  I would not be addicted to coffee.  Haha I guess STN impatcs your health dramatically!!  Funny, I was talking to Ed on Wednesday and he reminded me of this past summer.  I seriously didn't do anything this summer but edit and work.  I don't think I travelled anywhere farther south than the beach or anywhere more north than Philly, except for a week in Vegas.  I spent my days at the record store and at night in the White House.  It was a sick sick sick ritual that made me almost lose my mind.  And more nights than not, Ed, Epler, and/or Jay were there also editing or hanging out as we made numerous Wawa trips and exhausted the Discreets.  Wow.  So anyways, back to now.  To sum it up, I am the new Continuity Director of STN.  It's so funny because while talking to Aurora and Jen, I was reminded all of the times in years past that we joked around saying that when I graduate, I am just going to take Carlos's place.  So to become a UD staff member for the station is just fitting.  Except that i am under Carlos.  It's part time so I am still able to work at the record store, just not as much as my usual 45+ hours a week, haha.  Which is a great thing, but pretty much means that my schedule is going to kick my ass this week since the Rainbow schedule is already set.  Pretty much my work week entails working with the horses at 6 am, being at the TV studio at 8 am, then Rainbow at noon until we close.  But it's ok since I checked my bank account this morning and I have -5.84 in my checking account.   I talk a lot about things coming full circle, how everything is all interrealted and though we may not realize it now, it always comes around.  I am replacing Chris, who is one of the coolest women I know.  She's like an older me, which is hilarious.  She's the one that I would always house sit for.  She knows all of my crazy roadtrip stories and I have always asked her advice when it comes to guys or school.  She even wrote my recommendation to NYU and proofed my personal statement.  She partied hard, hit the road for shows when she was younger, loves to travel, and chased a boy and her dreams and won.  And Jen and I always joke around and say that we're sisters and I'm her protege because everything I have done, she winds up doing by chance.  Which is wonderful because I love Jen to death and I am so glad she is having fun and doing everything she does well.  We're too alike and its scary.  It's crazy how everything works out.    Let the games begin :-)

      It's been one of those weeks where I just didn't have the extra 15 minutes in my schedule to blog away, so we once again revisit that game "lets sum up the week in some blogs"...   Monday night was spent at the record store and Quizzo.  Marlon Spike had a big show this weekend, and usually the promotion begins on Mondays at Kates.  This time they made "super sexy" neon green score sheets with all of the necessary info prominently displayed.  The greatest thing about the evening was the fact that Chris barely slept, worked all day, was at Kate's promoting the show, drinking whiskey, and formulating his resignation letter.  It all makes perfect sense.  I don't think we came close to winning.

      I bought face wash today because I ran out.  I just grabbed whichever was the most versatile to take with me on the go.   My face is now tingly fresh, but I was brought back to summer.  Apparently I haven't recognized this scent since I was a summer camp counselor and it reminded me of those crazy weeks.  And I smiled because I amd fortunate enough to have experienced greatness.  Seriously, being a camp counselor is one of the most rewarding experiences ever and I had put it at the back of my mind until just now.  On a similiar note, I ran into Katie Evans, who was a super cool counselor with me, the other day and it was pretty groovy.  It's been years and for some reason I was reminded of Joy Wash.  And she likes the same music I do.  We're all alike.

      I just remembered a few things to add to Jen's post.  So this guy was bending over in front of our table with his ass hanging out of his pants.  I dared Laurie to grab his ass for a dollar and the girl did it.  Not just a brush but a huge hand filling grab.  She earned a buck from Jen too.  I think she even did it twice.  Then she struck up a convo with him, so damn funny.  Then there was this girl decked out in green.  Enough for Jen and me to stop our conversation and stare and for Hillary to go into "t-rex mode" and exclaim (saying the letters) "WTF was that!?!?"  And we cannot forget the announcement and enjoyment of the afternoon delights.    And DP Dough after last call is always tasty.  I hadn't hit the dough up since Britney and I aced our 60 page Chem final last May.

      I'll blog about my trip tonight, but for now you are graced with the details of my St. Patrick's Day.  Never beleive any one of us when we say "oh we're gonna stay in...oh ok, I'll go out, but I am not drinking....ok ok ok, i'll drink, but I won't get drunk!"  Screw that!  I think I knew I was done for when I exclaimed that the "pink was drink!".  Regardless, the drinks were pink and they were a tasty $2.  It was great hanging out with the girlies as we made fun of company we were with at Kate's.  I am on my way out, so I will cut and paste Jen's journal entry because it pretty much mimics what I would say anyways...  I'll add more later...    urlLink My goodness.  So we had planned for weeks to go out on St. Patrick's Day to celebrate Hillary's birthday and National Drink Alcohol Day. Only thing is, I had a presentation the next day, and Laurie an exam, so the two of us didn't intend on partying. I believe one of us even uttered "I don't even want to drink at all!" and we definitely said we'd leave by midnight. Let's see how that turned out:  Laurie, Hillary, Megan, Sasa, Jim, Brittany and her friends Chad and Mellora, and later Miranda all trecked to Kate's and surprisingly enough found a table. And $2 skyy drinks. Well, they're only $2, so Laurie and I figured it couldn't hurt to have one. Just one.   Saw Melissa Z, and we chased down the "distributer whore" that was handing out the beads to ask her some questions for documentary class. Now, I'm sure she was a sweet girl, and she was very helpful with what we asked. However, she was concave, and tanner than any blonde haired person should ever be, hence the tag of 'whore'. My apologies to any concave, blonde bronzed people out there.  Fast forward to 1am.   I have had 5 (yes, five) skyy drinks, and am off my ass. I've never had five of anything before ever. And I was the last one to brake the seal somehow. Something is wrong here. Laurie on the other hand, has had a pitcher, two beers, and two skyy drinks. And is as drunk as I am. And I think everyone else is too....  We head to D.P. Dough, where Miranda tells us her apartment is in the free Spark magazine, so we run outside to find one. She signs copies for all of us :) We get home, Hillary and I have some quality time, and Laurie and I pass out. No studying, no presentation work, just sleep.   So take it from me, when you go to a bar and people say 'I'm not going to drink' or 'I won't be out late' don't believe them. And don't go out the night before a presentation/exam/anything. And most importantly, no matter how dedicated you are to being responsible, $2 skyy drinks make the rules.

      And all of it was gone...coinciding nicely with the time we picked up the cell phone and starting dialing.  Have I not learned my lesson in how cell phones and liquor is not good!  Last night was spent with the Sypherd girls - Marissa, Amanda, Meg, and Kathryne - while they finished up their "Anything Goes" mix CD and we watched the finale of Frasier.  I have never seen the show, but I felt that I should be a part of pop culture.    Nestled somewhere in between Ashanti and Bob Dylan, Akiva was on the mix and by some sort of conversation we decided that calling him and leaving a crazy message was a good idea.  As well as calling Chrisand Bill and Derek among others.  And somehow random numbers and letters got mixed in with the text messages to Dan haha.  He came into the radio show today and informed me of my randomness with the phone.  Sigh...  Oh but it doesn't end there - then I come home and talk to Chris for over an hour.  It was great fun.    Ahh...what an enjoyable way to spend a Thursday evening after a stressful week!

       urlLink Aw yeah!   The time of year where everyone in Newark crowds the streets and gets silly drunk!!  And we were no exception...  We decided to whore it out and start our barcrawl at the Deer Park.  I had to safety my shirt to my bra my outfit was that scandalous.  And if you know me, you know that I am quite content in a t-shirt and cords.  As Jen, Laurie, and I trekked down Main Street Jen deemed us the "Boobie Brigade".  Oh sweet Jesus.  At least it was the boobie brigade instead of the ruffled skirt brigade that was found all around campus.  It was like a militia!    The three of us take our place at the bar and swipe some souveniers and chat about the upcoming months before we were joined by Tanya, Megan, Brittany, Hillary, and Melissa.  I love those bitches ;-).  I think that phrase was uttered a million times last night.  A few beverages were consumed at the Deer Park before departing to Grottos.  Apparently it was Ladies Night and they had $2 Long Islands.  We bypassed that and went right for the shot because we are tough like that.  Somewhere around then is when we kept saying "two four k" instead of "two k four" hence the 24000ness of the title.  We're like gold, baby.  After Grottos we proceeded to Kates where we got laid.  Ok, maybe not, but the sausage fest sure made it seem so.  I think it was 90's night or something, but the music was pretty damn bad and while getting drinks guys had a problem of getting way too close.  So we run far far away so our girl posse was safe.  Chris joined us here and hopefully we weren't too obnoxious, but it's all fun.  It was almost last call so the smirnoffs and martini's (damn we love our vodka) were swigged and it was time to swagger across the street.  The bar was desolate and we ordered a round of buttery nipples because for most of us, it was the shot of shoice for when we turned of age in Newark.  That and because it's tasty.  We talked and the New Hampshire girls loved and it was funtabulous.  Megan only had $3 left and she asked the bartender to just give her $3 worth, it was hilarious.    We spoke of the axis of fun and how its not goodbye, it's "i'll see you later".  We ended the evening in front of DP Dough as the balloon let out and it was like a reunion.  We had Ben take a picture of us actually crawling on the ground, hence, a bar crawl.  The we got hit on by thugs and hugged.  FABULOUS.

      April 23, 2004   urlLink Dewey Beach Pop Fest  - a gathering of some of my favorite people and musicians :-)  Tanya and I had left DE with a carload of booze and soaking wet clothes and meet Amanda and Marissa at the wonderful Marina Suites.  We get ready for an evening of good times by snacking and drinking and playing some cards.    We had planned to see the following artists, tour de farce - Akiva, The Jane Anchor, Marlon Spike, Graham Colton Band, & IKE.  We headed over to the Rudder once Aurora got into Dewey and checked out the Table Top Poets.  They didn't really hit us.  We met up with Joann (IKE) in the bathroom.  Not sure why I wrote that, but since I just pondered it, it is staying.   Some freaky guy had his eyes set on Marissa and though we tried to save her, she denied - strong girl!  Around 8 we went across the street to the book store to catch Akiva.  I have been ranting and raving about this guy for some time now so I was psyched that the girls were finally able to see him perform.  Jen and Laurie met up with us at this time so there was quite a gaggle of girls ready to rock.  Akiva didn't have a setlist so I felt it was my duty to hint at what he should play - and he did, wonderful.  During the whole set the girls and I kept hitting each other and smiling because he was so damn good and they knew I was right ;-).  Dan and Chris came by midway through then left to check out Super Sugar Cliff Hillis.  We chatted with Akiva a bit, bought some stuff, then headed over to the Rudder for some GCB action.  Aurora and I love Graham Colton Band, enough said.  It was fanatastic that they were added to the Dewey Beach bill and we were all for it.  We grab our seats front and center and enjoy the wonderfulness that is this band.  We're hardcore, we have seen them from North Carolina to Virginia to New Jersey and this was the first time Aurora saw them in Delaware - she couldn't get into the Stone Balloon show earlier in the year :-(.  Such a great band, and I think the girls were turned onto them as well.  Two for two!  By this time, the underagers were escorted out - DAMN THE RUDDER - and it was Jen, Laurie, Tanya, and I that remained.  IKE hit the stage to a surprisingly large crowd.  At this time Ike was in preproduction mode with Glenn so he was trying out his new camera at the Rudder.  So of course Jen and I checked out his equipment and shots more so than the bands performance.   He had our camera, it was a must!  After Deathbed we scooted out early to catch the Marlon Spike show at the Lighthouse.  They went on a little later than planned because the rain forced the outside stage to squeeze in on the inside stage times.  Bit it was worth the wait because they played Eb Jam.  Afterwards we met up with Akiva in the parking lot.  It was fate because as I was finding his number he called, haha.  So we meet up, Laurie and Jen left, and we head back to the hotel room to meet up with Amanda and Marissa.    The cards and booze were out and we just start talking, then Chris and Dan arrive.  It was pretty chill, just hanging out.  Definitely not as hardocre as years past, but still enjoyable.  Someone random knocked on our door then later came in, complete with buck teeth and a really southern accent and very energetic.  Amanda made fun of his accent, though he really was from North Carolina, and actually works with a band that I am connected with in a way.  Thanks to Josh Terry, who works with Evoka, I'm now knee deep in the industry haha.    Around 5 am we crash, Tanya and I on the pullout, Marissa and Amanda in the bed, Dan on the 3 couch cushions, Chris in his sleeping bag on the floor, and Akiva on the air mattress.  We wake up and watch Ice Age and talk pop culture before heading out to show the boys a fine breakfast at Cracker Barrell.  Blackberries were the fruit of choice.  And the biscuits were amazing.  Akiva even talked dirty to his biscuit.  It's true, I have pictures.    After the mid afternoon breakfast, we all parted our ways and said goodbye to the Dewey Beach Pop Fest.

      So here we go, trying to catch up on the past two months of my volatile life in little snippets on the web.  I'll write each major event as an episode, hopefully you will be on the edge of your seats to see what will emerge next...  I'm sitting at my computer with all of my band laminants hanging to the right in front of me.   urlLink Brand New All Access .  The All Access part of it not only includes free ticket and open bar, but also their hotel room couch to sleep on.    April 17, 2004 - but I guess I should go back the day before where  urlLink Dan  and I drove to NYC to hang out with Maryellen & Paul and see  urlLink Damien Rice .  Damien Rice played the Beacon and we had beer and  urlLink candy  for dinner because we got stuck in traffic.  It was a delectable meal because it was bought on the street corner.  Damien was simply amazing and now I am that much more complete for seeing him live.  We were seated way in the back, but close enough.    As soon as the show ended we hopped in a cab as Maryellen told us stories of New York and ended up at Desmonds to catch  urlLink Green to Think .  While driving up to NYC Ken warned me about his super snazzy shirt and boy was he right.  Giddy up cowboy.  It had snaps!  Haha.  Ken handed over his camera and I caught the craziness on film.  Desmonds is interesting, to say the least.  Steve was drunk and a good random time was had by all.  Well, except for one.  There was an industry person in the house, but who expects professionalism at Desmonds, hit up a real venue!  At the end of the set the guys took apart Ken's drum kit piece by piece and movied it forward to the front of the stage while he still played, hilarious.  Talked to Gilligan & Katie afterwards and told them how my life was a tragic comedy.  I think gilligan said his was a hard core romance novel with Fabio on the cover - unless I imagined that.  To go along with that theme, I missed a phone call from  urlLink Akiva  regarding a party that night in the city.  So onward we go to the subway in the wee hours of the morning and alas it is broken or late or something.  An hour later we make it to Hoboken.  No trip to Hoboken is complete without a stop at the nearby Dunkin Donuts for $.99 breakfast sandwiches.  Yum.  We drive back home in record time, enough for showers and changing and repacking before heading down to Dewey for the Brand New show.  Big  urlLink Yuenglings  and pizza with sweet peppers were enjoyed - but will not be enjoyed later.  I don't recommend this concotion.  The Dewey Beach Music Fest was also occuring this weekend so we walked through the youngin's and drank and hung out more at the Rudder.  Dan saw the Brand New guys and said hi and proceeded to score us All Access passes.  While waiting for the band to make it back to the venue we saw the Omnisoul guys and hung out for a little before taking full advantage of the hour left in the open bar at the Bay Center.  Brand New had to do a bunch of media stuff while Dan and I had a lot of drinking to do.  Vodka and cokes.   The doors open and a sea of kids come swarming in, so we hung out at the bar and recognized people we knew and enjoyed the show from afar.  A 15 year old girl was wearing the same shirt as me.  Around 11 Omnisoul played at the venue next to us so I took full advantage of my All Access pass and ran across the parking lot to catch their set and support them.  They sounded good and had a sea of unfamiliar girls dancing in front of them - good stuff.  I ran back and the door guy wouldn't let me back in, until Dan enticed me to walk right past him.  Screw you security as we proceed to the fully stocked green room.   I made nice with the security guard down there earlier in the night as a part of my 87 treks to the bathroom, so he was really cool.  We hang out in the green room and it surprised me on what little girls will do to get back there.  Seriously, I think some were nearly in tears!  Vinnie grabbed my sharpie and signed some stuff.  Many fans can thank me for their purple ink.  After we call it an evening at the Bay Center it was time to head off to the Marina Suites - the prime spot for Dewey partying many seasons over.    We drink on the way then it was decided to hit up a party on the other side of the hotel.  Some girls birthday or something.  Many people and open bottles there.  A few kids freaked out because Brand New was in attendence with us and girls danced weird - as was the music.  Mostly we hang out on the balcony doing various things and throwing various things.  This guy recognized Dan or something to that effect and he was pretty entertaining throughout the night.  I think at one time he even held my hand and that was a little odd.  But it was all about the love in Dewey.  Some one complained and more people were scared the cops were going to come, so we left obnoxiously loud.  Throughout the night we were invited to go with the band to North Carolina.  I was all for it but a certain someone had a speech to write.  I offered him napkins and a pen...  We crashed on the hotel room couch for a few hours and they left us the room and said "see ya in North Carlolina, Dan!" on the way out.    We wake up to the cleaning people and call it a day.  As soon as I got up I knew I was in trouble.  The elevator did me in and I ran out of the very nice hotel very fast before I ruined their carpet.  Instead I tarnished their outside wall.  And the dumpster.  And the bay.  Ughhhhhhhh.  I give Dan my keys and he had full reign of the Cabrio, along with a stop at the mega beach Wawa.  Iced tea and mint gum usually does the trick.  Oh no.  To make a sordid story sweet, don't try throwing up out a moving convertible.  Especially not twice.  I am so awful.

      So most of you know how I have an eensy obsession with the Olsen Twins - and surprisingly enough I have not seen  New York Minute  yet.  While I am working on my computer I am also watching the VH1 Special The Fabulous Life of the Olsen Twins.  And dammit, as their segway from one topic to another they used the same obscure song I used when I made the Green to Think Making of the Video.  So obscure that I forget the name of it now.

      Ok, maybe not there, but almost!  Recently my apartment has been plagued by giant ants.  I'm not one to get squeamish around bugs, but these creatures have freaked me out.  They are beyond the size of normal.  The first time I found one I tried to take it outside, but it was way too fast and escaped my helping him out the door.  So I have proceeded to kill them with the closest object.  It hasn't been too bad, just one or two a day, just the natural oncoming of summer.  Until today.  I found a horde of them chilling on the side of my cabinent.  It was a black mass of hell.  I froze and screamed - though I knew damn well no one could hear me, I couldn't help it - and grabbed the neared thing.  Antibacterial spray lysol, that will kill those creatures for sure.  So in a frenzy I went medieval on those ants and they are no more.  I win.

      I hate that new Fanta commercial.  It has to be up there with the rest of the most annoying commercials ever.  It does not impel me to buy a Fanta.  I want to throw up after I watch that damn commercial.  I hate it.  It fucking reminds me of such sad travesties as the Macarena and the Ketchup song.  A cheap Latin thrill that should die a horrible death and never emerge again.  Sorry for my bitterness but I seriously have heard that commercial about 4 times in the past half hour.

      Awesome - I'm such a wuss.  I just finished watching Big Fish, and though it wasn't groundbreaking, there were some cool effects and techniques used, and well, it's Tim Burton's work so its very admirable.  Of course I started tearing up.  And just the other week I cried at Jersey Girl.  Man, what's wrong with me?!  And I almost cried the other night during the movie that I saw prior to Big Fish.  Not for obvious reasons, but because another one bit the dust.  :-)

      There is this super hot guy in the store right now.  Charise and I are enjoying the view.  But he is probably at least 5 years younger than we are.  Scandalous to the extreme.  I take it back, ten year.  This kid may be 16.  If that.  He is going to be a heartbreaker.

      So last night there was a group of guys way into the PMB show and it was super awesome.  They were jumping up and down and singing and pretty much acting like us.  The bouncer guy near me kept telling his other bouncer friends that he was going to kick these guys out.  They were the only ones singing every damn word and having a great time!  They were underage and it wasn't like they were being drunken idiots, they were in the moment of the music.  Stupid asses.  He didn't kick them out, but that thought shouldn't have even crossed his mind.

       urlLink Photos here   Pat McGee Band played Power Plant Live and of course I was there.  After work, Dan and I trekked down 95 and after cricling aorund for 20 minutes, found parking and began the evening.    McFadden's had $10 all you can drink happy hour until 10 pm.  Nice.  We had a power hour and met some nice people.  Mix 106.5 was there and had free hats, Dan traded a CD for a hat, but he had to wear it all night.  Which would have been ok, if it wasn't a "White Chicks" hat.  He pulled it off, so he was allowed to wear it. :-).  I was getting antsy because the rock was about the start.  We met up with Dan's friends Andrew and Lou and by the time the third song started Lou and I were up front and on the steps.  A perfect view and in the midst of an awesome crowd.  I stayed while Lou went back to the guys.  J-Mo saw me and called me over to the backstage area and we chatted for a bit before he had to go back to do something rock productive.  I go back to wear I was standing and the little girlies in the ruffly skirts whispered about me when I came back.  Aw yeah.  Hahaha, wow people are funny.  So funny the conversations you pick up by eavesdropping.    The show was good, not great by other standards.  They played a decent mix of good songs that can fit into 90 minutes.  Nothing too jammy or surprising.  They played Passion, so of course I was happy.  The encore was Shine and Rebecca.  Todd Wright was magnificent as always.  So damn talented.  We met back up with Dan and Andrew as we watched Dan promote the Funk Box show.  The greatest line ever - Dan: here's a free CD of my band, we're playing at the Funk Box on Wednesday Girl: Oh, we're from out of town Dan: That's the good thing about a CD, you can take it with you!  So we continued the drink through the night.  Dan bought Andrew and Lou 32 ounces of beer each and that is a lot of beer.  It's like a 44 ounce cup at Wawa, just 32 ounces.  Julia enticed us (ok, the boys) to go upstairs to Tiki Bobs for free.  We even got TB.  While Dan tried to scheme and score a free drink, I got a free drink ;-).  He even talked to think girl for a while who I was sure was going to give in, but she didn't.  We all guessed she was over 30.  Hey, nothing wrong with that!  We told him he may have a better chance with gay guys, but all of our gaydars are shot.  But lo and behold, two hottie gay guys came in arm and arm, Dan had his shot, but didn't take the reins.  He admited defeat, even with the White Chicks hat, and we called it a night.  My car was still there and we destinated to Sheetz.  So most of my friends know about my addiction to Wawa, but my southern friends tell me that Sheetz is the way to go.  Morgan had told me about one in Joppatowne, so that is where we went.  Gas was $1.89!!!!!!  In all of its red bright glory, we entered our first Sheetz.  A little snazzy, a little too kitschy, but all in all a good road stop.  I didn't dare try their coffee, but their egg and cheese bagel was fantastic.  They had way too many choices and it boggled my mind.  Mac and Cheese or bagel sandwich?!?!  I still don't know which I like better.   Wawa is so familiar and safe.  I think I will have to take a roadtrip down south to determine.  Perhaps the Carolina's in July?  Or maybe there will be some on the way to Ohio.  120 free  urlLink Marlon Spike  discs, 90 minutes of PMB rock, 27 kajillion annoying ruffly skirts, many ounces of booze, and two bagel sandwiches later, we crashed at 3 am a good night left in the dust.

      I have some downtime before work and while waiting for e-mails back to me, so I figured I would play catch up.  I just read Maryann's web journal and figured it was about time for me to post one of the big events of the summer - thus far...Rainbow Nite!   urlLink Pictures can be seen here.  June 5th was supposed to be Newark nite and I had it all planned out.  Newark Nite draws about 30,000 people and I figured that having an evening full of live music in the store would be a fantastic idea.  After battling the city of Newark, ganking lights, and postering like crazy, it rained like a monsoon on Saturday.  The one thing I couldn't control became disasterous.  I was SO FRUSTRATED!!!  But at least all the guys I had performing are awesome and decided to play anyway.    The bill was Steve from Green to Think, Akiva, and Marlon Spike.  Let's see...who came to the show...Raf, Max, Maryann, Tanya, Marissa, Amanda, Dave, John, Morita, Katie, Oliver, Elise, Dan, Rebecca, Tristan, Zack, and Sarah.  Hehe.  Zack and Sarah.  Ben Folds.  Ah.  At least we were all into it.  It was fabulous just hanging out with everyone and listening to our friends.  Akiva messed up a few times but we forgave him and sang louder for it.  Rob and I started the drinking in the store around 2 pm because my stress levels were through the roof.  By the time the music started I think Raf and I were pretty far gone.  We had all the bevs upstairs so people just kept going up and down and you know it wasn't just coke in those cups.  June 5th was also the Belmont and of course we were all rooting for Smarty Jones.  At race time, which was also during Akiva;s set, Sark asked if he could go upstairs to watch the race.  A trickle of people left Rainbow and ten minutes later, a line of sad faces came back into the store.  Sad, but funny.  We pretty much picked Akiva's set for it, asking him to play certain songs, and of course "Tuesdays" twice.  Chris rules because he played all of my favorite Marlon Spike songs and of course shouted them out to me.  He gets team points for that one.  After the rock we all went to Peace A Pizza for grub and bombarded the staff.  Potato pizza has got to be one of the most perfect things on earth.  And after Peace A Pizza naturally comes the after party.  Raf, John, Charise,Dave, Aurora, and Lee made it to the after party, so that was fun.  We busted out some Motown and Hootie and had a little singing and dance party.  We must have looked insane.  There was even a bit of a Hootie remix due to my insanely senstive stereo.  You can fit three people in Tanya's belt.  Everyone ran to their cameras for that one.  Akiva gave me a music history lesson in NY rock on my computer.  Maryann was the 88th member of the Marlon Spike message board and there are 88 keys on a piano.  Trippy.  Akiva and Steve were talking on the futon and Aurora and were staring because we realized that they looked related.  It was an odd moment.  Hmmm...what else - this is all pretty much a stream of consciousness...McDermott came back with Dan and Katie, but remained into the night.  I swear, the more that guy drinks, the wittier he gets.  Near 3 am, it was the last of the troopers, me, maryann, chris, lee, dave, akiva, and dan.  Though akiva was pretty much out on my foldy chair, so he semi counts.  Everytime a music topic came up we "all music-ed" it.  Too bad you can't "all music" everything, like korean recipes.  We kept telling Akiva that he was fair game until he takes off his shoes.  The poor guy, went to take off his shoes and dozed off n the process!  He woken up to one of our bouts of laughter and he pointed to McDermott who also found solace in the foldy chair and mid head turn to look at McDermott, Akiva fell asleep again!  He finally got up and walked to my bed.  As I offered that he could lay down if he wanted, he was out and under the covered before I could finish my sentence!  Only Chris, Lee, Maryann, McDermott, and I remained.  The wonderful glow of DD enticed Dan over, but not without the laser tag helmet that was left in my apartment from March's boozing.  So he trekked over in the helmet never to return.  Around 5:30 am we heard the birds chirping decided to call it an evening.   Since Akiva was sprawled out on my bed, he monopolized about seven pillows, leaving Maryann and I with the futon decoration pillows.  I busted out the air mattress and used my papasan pillow for added comfort.  Maryann woke up and left around 11:30 and I woke up shortly after.  Akiva was still out so I used the alone time to clean and straighten up.  We watched TV and talked about music tactics and of course other various music things before we said our goodbyes.  lucky guy was seeing Gavin DeGraw and Michael Tolcher that night in the city!  All in all a wonderful evening with fanastic friends :-)

      So there are few things that I really spend money on.  Seriously, most of my paycheck goes to bills, such as rent, internet, car, insurance, you know - life necessities.  I have a secret guilty pleasure in internet shopping that is becoming addictive.  Charise and I will seriously spend hours online checking out our favorite online stores (oh please, the mall is so not for me) and mock shop just for the thrill of it.  That is good enough for me, occasionally i do make the large online purchase, but most of it is last season stuff or super cheap clearance stuff so its ok.  I honestly wear the same pair of black flip flops everyday.  They make me almost an inch taller, they are comfy, and match everything.  I love my flip flops more than I like most material things.  But today, brace yourself, Aurora and I hit the stores.  While driving back from Philly feeling slightly guilty since I should be watching my wallet, I told Aurora its just like most girls (not us, naturally we're not like most girls) who recently break up with a boyfriend and they go and sleep with like 5 guys.  We went nuts, just with shopping.  We were smart about it, but still.  We both had fat paychecks so we needed a thrill.    First stop was H & M because I needed to return a shirt.  Yay for credit.  I have a penchant for scarves and they had some for super cheap, so I had to get my fill.  And they had bras wicked cheap and since its tank top season, instead of trying to hide the straps, screw it, I try to get the most colorful and flashy straps because there is no sense in trying to hide it.  Underwear should be fun.  Bracelets were also on sale and I can never go out with a wrist adornment.  And I bought a yellow tank top.  That was the only thing not on sale, but it was only twelve bucks.  Across the way was Bath & Body works with a big red sale sign out front.  It was a must.  I needed more travel antibacterial handwash stuff.  Oh come on, you never know how the bathrooms are going to be in bars and on the road.  Our next stop was Victoria's Secret because its the semi-annual sale time.  Aurora and I have a knack of randomly and not so randomly buying the same article of clothing.  A lot of the times we have to converse on our evening attire so we don't look weird.  We were at seperate racks and ending up picking up the same obnoxiously bright pink and yellow bra.  So we bought.  As well as matching purple underwear.  Not entirely on purpose, but we both liked.    I bought a belt for 5 bucks.  Aurora found some goods at the vintage shop with the nice worker guy.  He has trouble keeping his secret stash too.  We were oddly disappointed at Guacamole - our favoritest stroe ever.  There was seriously nothing to be talked out of.  I saw some shoes that I liked but would never wear and the roos weren't on sale.  Grr.  We probably would have gone out with a bagful of stuff at the retro thift store if we didn't have just ten minutes before they closed.  One of my favorite jewelry stores in the village (nyc) just opened up a store on South Street.  Rock on.  I was proud of Aurora and her funky bracelet purchase.  I bought a bracelet and a necklace.  I was talking to the clerk about how much I liked his store because he noticed I had on one of their bracelets.  I think he hooked me up, I decided not to look at the reciept.  I needed them!!  NEED!  We stopped at Wawa and dodged the raindrops while singing to Omnisoul in the car.    I'm allowed to slip to my addictions every once in a while!

      Macaroni and laundry do not mix.  let me explain.  The other day I was draining the extra macaroni water into the sink.  The lid slipped and some of the macaroni careened into the sink.  I was able to salvage some from going down the drain and threw them in the trash.  Quite a few went down the drain.  I didn't think this would be a problem until later on in the evening.  The water in my toilet became lower and my sink was very slow to drain.  In the shower later, I emerged with 4 inches of water still in the tub.  Oh this is a problem.  Two days later and my drains are still slow to drain.  I took a shower at noon and the tub is half fll of water that hasn't drained.  What do I do?!?!?!?!  Noodles expand in water - this is going to be a mess!! And I really need to do my laundry, but I am afraid of what disaster that may cause!  Either the washer machine will blow that macaroni right out of the pipes, or I will be swimming with them.  Oh geez.

       urlLink The evening is documented here   So if you know me, you know that one of my favorite bands (among many, but this one is in the forefront) is Vertical Horizon.  On Wednesday June 9, 2004 they played a free show down in Dewey, DE.  Of course i was there.  Yeeeeaaaarrsss ago through some PMB folks, I heard about Vertical Horizon.  Naturally I went on Napster and downloaded a few tracks and immediately liked this band.  The first song I downloaded was "Sunrays and Saturdays" because I thought the title sounded interesting and it remains still as one of my favorite songs by them.  I downloaded all of the live and studio stuff I could find and bought their release "Running On Ice".  Still, one of my favorite albums.  I think I had more of their stuff on my computer than any other band (aside from complete PMB shows).  Oddly enough, I can count on two hands the amount of times I have seen them, and you know for me that's rare for a band I have liked for years!  Because Vertical was in Dewey I was reminded of a certain night in July 2 years ago.  Mark Williams and I were in my car covered in sand talking about music around 5am as we searched for a missing tour van.  I mentioned how I loved VH and didn't beleive him that Matt Scannell is one of his good friends until he showed me his phone.  The rest is history.  So I was superpsyched for the Dewey show.  I picked up Tim and Andre and we set off for McDonalds then the beach.  Andre bought me a strawberry banana milkshake and it was fantastic.  they also gave Andre and I balloons.  Poor Tim missed out on the balloon action.  We made the customary beach stop at Wawa and couldn't tell if our cashier was a man or a woman.  For real.  Then we took a picture of the marquee outside of Wawa.  Classic.  While making the u-turn to go back south, we saw the Crabby Dicks sign.  Those two signs alone was worth the drive!  There wasn't any mention of show time or doors on any website, so we milled around for a few hours at the Cork.  People are scary.  I don't mean to be mean, but seriously.  Someone was wearing shortalls.  Shortalls.  Remember those?!?!  And there was an elephant toe spotting.  Use your imagination because I think if I write it out, I will get sick.  It was like an epidemic, you couldn't help but stare.  And guys, seriously, tank tops don't look good on you.  Honestly.  The lights get low and I drag the boys up front with me.  Inside, You're A God, When You Cry, I'm Still Here, Japan, Best I Ever Had, Shackled, Forever, Comfortably Numb, Send It Up, Everything You Want  Encore: Wash Away, We Are  As you can see it was a short set, but I still had fun.  Some annoying drunk girl was really obnoxious and so to alleviate the situation I parked myself in between her and her boyfriend.  Tim and Andre gave me props on that one and i think Andre blocked her friends.  It was a team effort.  Tim said it best when he stated that free shows allow the casual fans to infilterate the venue.  Yeah, ugh.  A group of girls to the side of Tim talked about how they were gonna get backstage after the show.  Oh geez.    But matt Scannell kicked ass!  I swear he is one of the best guitarists I have seen.  Seriously, the guy is wicked talented and shreds on stage.  And Sean Hurley, their bassist, again, one of the best bassists I have seen live.  Granted I have seen VH live before, but never as close.  The last time i saw them was in North Carolina and I was backstage so I only got the see the side view, not the in your face rock that must be experienced.  I was absolutely floored by the performance.  Keith definitely got some mic time and Japan was a welcomed treat.  They did a fantastic cover of Comfortably Numb and even threw in some Eleanor Rigby during the encore.  Fabulous :-).

       urlLink Pictures from the LDE portion of the weekend can be found here   I tossed and turned all night due to my ears still ringing, my stomach still uneasy, and the pain of an impending sore throat.  I think I had jinxed myself because I told Chris L. Before he left for Michigan that I always know when I am becoming super stressed out because I will get a sore throat.  Another wonderful side effect of CFS.  I woke up the Saturday morning with no voice and the worst cough ever.  After a few hours struggling at the store, I went back upstairs to get some rest.  After a couple of hours of Z's I went to the theatre to see "Saved".  Funny as all hell.  I laughed my ass off.  Funny because its true.  Apparently quite a few members of the production crew and a rock band pulled out of the film because of its crude sense of portrayal.  Such is life.  Came home and it was decided that Annapolis is where we were to be Saturday evening.  Nevermind the lack of voice or the impending fever or the common sense that told us to stay in.  I pick up Dave and Tanya, hit up the Wawa for dinner, and then we hit up 95.  You know it was a good night before when I asked Tanya what stupid things we did at the Logan House and said not to ask her because its like the blind leading the blind.  We knew it would be another good evening due to the purple Swift truck that we passed.  It was right after that bridge 20 miles away from Newark.  Oh I know my roads.  We pick up Steve en route in Bel Air and made it to Annapolis shortly after 10.  Tanya and Dave warned Steve about my driving, but it was all about safety because I wore my glasses.  The taxi driver who was speeding down the road who almost hit us was not all about safety.  We found a nearby lot as well as O'Brien's which was brimming with people way dressed up.  Oh fun, a bachelorette party and a wedding party.    I don't even know where to begin.  I could just list everything that happened...I got shoved away from the bar from a significantly older and heavier man who wanted to get to his 9 shots before I could grab my one bottle.  Tanya and I didn't dance as much as we usually do because we had to use our super powers to ward off the weirdos.  There was Aaron who was in the Navy who humped my leg.  Chris asked if it was hot, and oh it was.  You can never go wrong with a good public leg humping.  PBR hat guy who was leg humpers friend fell all over Tanya.  This other guy asked Steve if Tanya was his girlfriend and once he answered no, the guy put his arm around Steve.  Scandalous!  Phil was drunk running around with a shirt on his head.  Chris sang about Long Island ice teas.  Brad grabbed my ass and tore open a CD sleeve with his teeth.    Oh! And JonaSteve was there.  I had called Mark on my way down to Annapolis and I woke him up - silly boy.  We talked about music life in DC and whatnot and it was cool running into him again, though it wasn't a Red Fish Monday evening.  Some girl lost her shoes.    All in all it was a good and fun birthday for Phil.  He looked extremely happy and that's all that matters.  It was cool to see how much he loves his bandmates, rare you see such eminent joy.  Hmmm what else can be mentioned in bits and pieces...  The girls in attendence were freakishly tall.  I played with Chris' sweaty head.  Brian said i still smelled good, luckily I showered.  Sundresses and pink pants are dangerous.  And why is there not a gas station open past 2 am in Maryland's capital!?!?!?  We drove home brutally fast.  My poor passengers had to endure the 85 miles will me coughing every two minutes and definitely not having any semblance of a voice.  4 am sleep never seemed so sweet.  :-)

        I usually love Fridays more than any other day of the week because they are jam packed with musical goodness.  First off, I get to sleep in till noon and that is always wonderful.  Second, I have my weekly bout at the radio station then head over to the record store for a few hours before heading out for some other adventure.  This Friday was no different - it was a Lloyd Dobler Effect Day!    Chris Bruno (lead guitarist/vocals) for LDE called me while he was in Bethany Beach saying that he was heading up north soon and wanted to know if I wanted to catch up with him.  So after a great radio show (callers, lots of callers!), I gave Chris a mini tour of Newark and had dinner at the East End.  The guy is a fast talker, more so than I, which took me aback since I am usually never speechless - ha.  I learned a lot about him during that hour, which was cool and creepy at the same time because he has the same quirks I do.  At least I feel better knowing that I am semi normal now with my addictions to order and am a creature of habit.  I bit my tongue when he verbalized that he has the same breakfast I do, day in day out.  My day just isn't right if I start it out wrong.  He was allowed to stay at the table because he is a democrat, and since that conversation, Michael Moore has appeared in my dreams twice.  Or maybe because Moore is continuously on the CNN page right now.  Which is also Chris' homepage and we have the same reading habits.  Weird - ha.  So after dinner we strolled along Main Street in search of strawberry mentos.  No such luck.  Tanya and I started our evening rolling around Wilmington trying to find parking.  We went to Dead Presidents because we heard they had drink specials for Reasgon, which is so wrong, but we won't complain if it means cheap booze.  We walked into the bar, realized we were the youngest ones there, and quickly walked out.  Logan House it is.  We got there a bit early so we started off with a beverage - Red Bull & vodka for her, Sprite & raspberry vodka for me - as we talked and dodged creepy guys who had too white smiles.  We go upstairs to have our customary shot and I introduce her to the LDE guys.  We also meet up with old and new friends, Dave, Ben, Steve, Chris, Nate, Alex, and Kristen.   Tanya and I are always ready to sing and dance and scheme, so we did.  Phil's acoustic wasn't patched in or something so you couldn't hear it the first set.  Who knew that the crowd wanted to actually hear the music?!  Silly soundman.  That's what happens when you leave Brad and Chuck at home.  Unless they were frightened on what would become of the Logan House since every occassion is dangerous.  During the break we talked to Brian and he meets my approval.  Especially because he liked the smell of my hair.  He fits in well and I can see him being a great addition to the band.  Even though he wears his bass high, it allows him to rock harder :-).          Chris broke a string on what I think he said was his favorite guitar and he equated restringing it to sex or something like that.  His sweat stain looks like a heart.        The night usually isn't complete until Phil incorporates my name along with some sort of story in a song.  This time he started the second set with "A Million Ways" which he said was for me and changed a verse to center arond me. Oh geez, I hope i didn't turn four shades of red.  But we danced and it was fun.  And Chris M. got his "Two Step" and it was fabulous.    After the show we played the load out game.  Or, the band played the load out game, Tanya played the talking game, and I hung out with Chris at the trailor.  Tanya kept saying how the trailor looks lik my fridge - yay.  Rock Lesson #473 is loading the trailor correctly.  Tanya and I mocked made out and I think I bit her sometime in the course of the evening, but I think that was upstairs.  We said our "see you laters" and I think as we were leaving we talked about porn and dating.  We hit up 95 and called LoPresto to wake him up and left an inebriated message.  We dodged cars on the interestate while Chris apparently followed.    Then we passed out and a fantastic Friday was complete.  :-)

      So naturally I do have a lot of events to catch up on, but this one is short and sweet while my dinner cooks on the stove.  Last week, I met Tim and Andre at the Deer Park for an evening beer, or a few, and half priced (veggie) burgers.  It was good just to kick back and relax and talk about the good old times when the bar was dirty and the people were cool.  Funny, Tim would tell a story of the Deer Park from eyars ago, and forget I was there.  "This one time..." "Yeah, I was there too".  Sigh - we are such townies.    Somewhere during their third pitcher and my second glass, me switching shirts with Andre suddenly became a good idea.  I was wearing red pants and a black shirt, while he was wearing jeans and a red shirt.  He also has a few extra pounds on me.  For the next half hour, we deliberated on how we could attain such a fantastic feat such as chaning clothing in the middle of the bar.  Elevator, men's bathroom...?  Some douche of a waiter caught on to our idea, unnecessary obstacle.  We took the plunge and escaped into a nearby dining area and did the switcharoo.  I looked like a tomato.  We then heard Tim distract the waiter as we held our breath.    We calmly took our seats as many faces dropped as they saw not my completely red outfit, but Andre's physique in my tight black v-neck shirt.  It was classic and totally worth it.  Our waitress threatened to flag us and/or kick us out.  I then ran into some people I knew and the only thing I could mutter in between laughter was that I normally don't dress like this.    Good times good times :-)

      I am way too sleepy and I won't have any time to post in the next few days, so I will cut and paste what Mr. Matt posted on the Omnisoul message board about our jaunt in the city on Tuesday night...  Luna Lounge Show --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I’m going to take a shot at a review of last night’s festivities. First off, Miranda and I left Newark early and because she drives like a champ, we got to the city with plenty of time to look for fun things to do (green light, green light, green light! Yessss!!). This was in spite of mapquest creating imaginary street names which do not correspond in any way to NYC.  Josh and I learned how one parallel parks in 28 steps or less as Miranda gave us ten minutes worth of meter-side entertainment.  Although we could have eaten at the shop which serves grilled-cheese ONLY, we went to a cool pizza place, outside of which there was a man sitting…. Forever! It seemed like he was staking claim to his own chunk of sidewalk for hours. I guess you had to be there. Anyway, there wasn’t much to do in the proximal area to the Luna Lounge. There was of course the popular orange-shirted guy who was caught by the fuzz for selling drugs and pinned to the ground to the delight of hordes of onlookers. There was also a charming young man talking to his girlfriend on the phone next to us: “Hon, we should go out dancing or something tonight, it’ll be nice. And then afterwards we can come back to my place and have some awesome sex. Yeah babe, it’ll be sweet.” One tends to worry about the gene pool. After hours of chilling around town, finally, the show! There were three bands in total. Omnisoul was sandwiched between “Money Money” and “Spank.” Don’t worry, mothers, despite what you may be thinking, this was NOT an adult-themed evening.  M.M. came all the way from Canada along with an admirable fan base. I met two girls who made the ten-hour bus trip from Toronto. Said one of them, “In Canada, we have beer, we have hockey, and we have sex.” (My bags are packed). The sound was earth-shatteringly loud, which left some of us somewhat incapacitated the rest of the evening.  Omnisoul went on the stage around 9 and proceeded to rock our kneecaps off. The set went as follows:  All or None Twinkle of a Life Waiting Scare the Night Home to Home Another Day Gone Feel What You Want The Greater You  I think that the strongest song was STN. Derek put the most amount of energy into the really intense parts of the songs and it really impressed us. Furthermore, Josh’s bass solo was tight as ever and unlike at some venues, we got to hear it loud and clear. We all have to thank the friendly house sound man with the entertaining accent. Mike Tate on the lighting added some extra spirit to the performance, especially Home to Home and Another Day Gone. A real spectacle (which was a perfect photo-op) was Shawn’s guitar solo in Twinkle. Derek came over and stood looking over his shoulder as if to say “Yeah, play that reeeeeal niiiiiice!!!” the intra-band interaction was strong. This has been noticeably improving lately and it adds some more energy to the shows.   Even the ride home was fun. Miranda caught several traffickers off-guard with her cat-like maneuvers around the city and outside of the tunnel, which landed us at dunkin donuts (where else do all good road trips pass through?). We passed through my home turf in NJ to get some gas and the station attendant said, “Oh, they all give me 2, 3, 4, 5 dollars. You give me 10 dollars! I am so lucky!!” clearly happy that Miranda was gracing him with her presence and cash.   We hope that more familiar faces came make it out to the shows in July! For everybody who came to the Luna Lounge last night, I want to hear what you think of the show and the trip!  -Matt

       urlLink Blurry pictures of The Downtown   Saturday morning was brutal, though highly entertaining compliments of Jen.  She had lost her contact in my bathroom and after a bout of frustration she found it suctioned to the side of my sink.  Funny shit.  Jen and I went out to breakfast at Newark Bagel place and it was greasily fantastic.  I spent Saturday afternoon at the store with the girls, which is always trouble.  I escaped the store around 5 pm and hit the road with Aurora and Tanya for a 170 mile destination.  Of course no trip is complete without our customary stop at Wawa for caffeine to fuel us.  Our goal?  Farmingdale, NY to see Akiva and Ron Sexsmith.  But mostly Akiva because his music is super saucy.    In the player: The Clarks "Fast Moving Cars", Akiva "Bueno y Sano" (our rule is that we can listen to the artist that we are seeing if we are beyond the 100 mile mark), Jonasay "Live at the 9:30 Club", Lloyd Dobler Effect advance music, Omnisoul "Live at the Scrounge", and Jamie Cullum "Twentysomething".  On the way to the rest stop we told our stories from the previous evening as well as other misadventures such as bracelet heads and bladder crushed uteruses.  Uteri.  Uteri or uteruses?  Burger King is becoming my favorite road stop because they have veggie burgers.  Has anyone else noticed how immaculately clean the Jersey rest stop bathrooms are?  Jersey rest stops kinda bother me a little because they all look the same, and while its predictable, its not always fun.  Half the adventure is not knowing what to expect, and you expect the Jersey rest stop.    Traffic was moving fine until we hit New York.  Uggghhh - I don't think I hit fifth gear until we were almost in Farmingdale.  Kinda odd, along the highway there was a park.  I would call out to people as we rolled along, but the girls reminded me that this wasn't a good idea while we were cruising at 10 mph.    We find The Downtown, not quite using our directions, but we found it nonetheless.  Cute town.  We grab our stuff, lock the doors, and head to the club.  Wait - I forget my wallet.  Turn around.  The venue was pretty neato, the way I would decorate a venue.  When Aurora, Marissa, and I have our venue, it will look like this.  The stage was large and not very high.  Cymbols covered the lights and guitars adorned the walls.  Shit, I forgot my camera.  Back to the car.  It was kind of laid out like The Point but more spacious.  Everyone was sitting down, and there was no way I was going to sit down after I was sitting for three hours, so we stood.  Hopefully we didn't block too many peoples' views.    Akiva took the stage with Simon and began the rock.  Simon had this box he sits on and beats with his hands.  See above pictures for a blurry view.  It was awesome.  Aurora saw a sticker on his instrument that said "Simon Rocks My Box".  That's the greatest sticker ever (and now we possess one).  I'm totally honest when I say this guy is super good and up there in my top ten artists right now.  Well, probably my top five on my one list.  I have to have two lists - one of the artists that I support, will see whenever they are close by and I have all their albums and stuff like that, and the other list is just artists that are just out there.  Such as um, Radiohead.  I love them, and well, I have all of their CDs too, but I have only seen them once and don't even have a shirt.  And there is Pat McGee Band.  Totally different band, also my favorite band ever, I have all their albums, I think I have every shirt made because the band gave them to me or I bought them back in the day, and whenever they are within a few states radius, I will usually be at those shows.  Two different schemas.  But yeah, Akiva would be in the PMB category of my rock list.  This could be a totally different post.  It will be.  Whew, that was a tangent and a half.  This new paragraph makes me feel all clean and new.  So yeah, the show was good, half funky rock, half singer songwriter crooning.  Akiva even covered Sarah McLachlan even though he didn't say her name write and I probably didn't write her name right.  Akiva wore the shirt of the place his CD was named after, which prompted Aurora and I to contemplate checking that place out next time we are in Boston.    After the show we moved the the back so that the others could actually see.  We chatted for a bit with Akiva until Ron Sexsmith came on.  They were a really colorful band, with Ron leading the pack with a purple shirt.  My initial reaction was old school Wilco but that could be because Ron reminded me a bit of Jeff Tweedy.  A little after 11 we decided to head back home.  Were we seriously only there for less than two hours?!  Talked to Akiva some more and we may head down to Atlanta.  Hmmm.  Its been a few years since I have been to Atlanta...  But due to money and time, it will either have to be Atlanta or Cleveland.  Time will tell, but I am sure we will have our answer by Thursday since then Aurora and I can actually figure things out.  Aurora said the funniest thing ever.  To be followed by Tanya.  "I need someone with a tongue ring."  I look back at her.  We pause.  "NOT YOU!".  Haha.  i think Aurora missed this because she was in the back of my car switching CDs.  Starsailor replacing the Clarks and the new Akiva sampler replacing the Jonasay.  And we were on our way to the 7-11 we previously passed.  Not as good as Wawa, but the Slurpees will do.  The NY roads were still trafficky even after midnight.  Do people ever sleep?!!  I can't imagine what it would be like at 5 pm during the week!  While gong over the bridge this carfull of guys stared at us and one got in the back seat to, what we assume, plaster his phone number on the back windshield.  Unfortunately we did not catch up to them, haha.  We stopped for gas and coffee and Jersey rest stop coffee has got to be the worst ever.  We only had two choises, 12 ounces and 24 ounces.  That is a huge difference and a major beverage choice!!  Aurora and I opted for the larger since we are addicted.  Big mistake.  The warm flavorless coffee barely took us home at 3 am.

      I swear I have no dignity.  I would post pictures, but damn yahoo has been screwing up and I can't upload anything.  Soon enough, check back.  I started the day with an awesome radio show with plenty of callers, and ended it at the Logan House.  I drove up with Matt and Dave early so we could catch Omnisoul before IKE came on.  Ran into John Faye while going upstairs and he had the same outfit on as me again.  Except I had a bright blue scarf and my black shirt was a tank top, not a t-shirt.  Omnisoul rocked the house as usual.  Took some decent pictures, too bad you can't see them.  Their new album drops in August, you should stop by their site and preorder it.  Its gonna be hot.  But yeah, the show sounded good except the vocals sometimes, a little too hot.    Before arriving to the Logan House I warned my friends that I couldn't get drunk because I was afraid of what I may do.  Such as make an ass out of myself.  And I said that I couldn't get drunk because i would end up dancing with Glenn.  Yup.  Miss Jen came up from DC just in time to get her rock on with IKE.  So we sang and danced as usual.  IKE performed a Prince cover and Glenn went nuts and drug me out to dance with him, so we did.  Dave said he wished he had a camera.  It was a crazy good time.  When IKE played  Deathbed , Glenn grabbed me and we celebrated as John mentioned the music video.  Woohoo!!  And of course Jen and I did our "na na na na na naaa's".    John had handed me the mailing list and some blue cards to distribute during and after the show.  I wasn't drunk, I was just in a giddy mood because of the interesting turn of the evening.  So while John was tuning, he mentioned to the crowd that I had the blue cards.  So I said.... "They're blue!  Like Viagra!"  What possessed me to say this in the presence of the crowd, I have no idea.  Again, maybe it was because of the interesting turn of the evening. "What was that Miranda, can you repeat that?!" - John "They're blue!  Like Viagra!" - me "There you go guys, go see Miranda for your penile dysfunction" - John  Why why why why why do I do these things?!  Oh but it was interesting, throughout the night I met and talked to some nice people.    We said our goodbyes and headed home to Newark.  Jen and I had a sleepover and spent the evening catching up and talking about our scandals and misadventures.  I can't wait to see her in DC next week! :-)  And that was Friday.

      Lloyd Dobler Effect & Virginia Coalition @ Power Plant Live  A fantastic evening of go-go funky beats in the rain.  Tanya, Dave, and I headed down to Baltimore to catch the musical goodness and take full adventage of the happy hour specials.  $10 all you can drink from 6 pm - 10 pm.  Woohoo!!  Tanya and I also learned what rail drinks are.  Nonstop gin & tonics and rum & cokes!  We went back to get Tanya's sweatshirt from the car and grabbed the umbrella because if we have the umbrella in tote, then the rain would stop - and it did, just for us.  Lloyd Dobler Effect took the stage and played about an hour of all originals.  It sounded and looked great.  We could hear an acoustic - imagine that!  I spilled ice on myself and lost my bright green straw.  Tanya had two straws - which matched her gin soaked lime.  We danced and sung and it was fun.  We sucked down our drinks and went for more many times throughout the set.  Since we both had drinks in our hands the whole night, we slapped each others hands instead of clapping at the end of each song.  Chris tried to mack it up for my camera, but since its digital its not instantaneous so the pictures didn't come out as I planned, but still great.  Brian bounced though it wasn't digitally captured.  During the set break Tanya and I went to the bathroom to discover a stall without a lock, a stall without a toilet, and a stall without a door.  Pick your poison.  We came back to stand on the opposite side of the stage for some Vaco action and hung out with Steve, Erica, and the LDE guys.  I absolutely love Virginia Coalition and it was great to see them live again.  It's been a long time.  They were my first Center Stage band YEARS ago.  The show was great, even though Steve added so much to them.  They played a few new songs that will be on the upcoming album and of course the oldies but goodies.  We got our dance on and I kept beer caps on my hat.  Tanya and I had a scandalishly good time dancing in front of others.  Time to go so we find the guys.  Phil stole my camera for group shots to go on the webpage.  Chris made me smell him.  Rusty grabbed Tanya and my asses.  Phil took us backstage and gave us goodies.  Wow, Tanya has now been guestlisted and got a free signed CD ;-).  Phil and I chatted about NYC and a plan of attack and he signed my arm iwith my purple sharpie.  We then escaped with Rusty as he signed my back and told all the passerby to look at my black girl booty.  He said his name is not Rusty, but "I am fucking drunk".  The boy fell off the wagon.  He hadn't been drinking in A WHILE.  About a year maybe?  I think Phil's party did him in last weekend.  Sigh.  He could't even stand or finish his sentences.  Apparently I have a "da dunk a dunk" whereas Tanya has a "da dunk".  Brian laughed at us as he hauled off gear and Rusty has a big mouth.  I still love him so that is OK.  Tanya got her new free CD signed by the rest of the guys, except for Donnie and Doug because they left.  Rusty and Tanya plotted on embarrassing me, and its ok because I have lost my diginity with this band long ago.  Too many drunken days and nights and miles with them for me to save face.  But yeah, I turned eight shades of red and we scampered off to the car.  I didn't know if we could make it to a gas station, but we found my trusty Royal Farms off of exit 57.  15 miles later we enjoyed Sheetz.  So not even close to beating Wawa's wonderfulness.

       urlLink    The night was brought to us by Sparks.  After work, I piked up Tanya and we Sparked it up while playing on the computer.  Which is never a good idea.  At least I didn't call anyone.  I wait, yeah I did.  Phil was the first phone call.  Oh my - onward to Aurora's.  We walked over to Prospect, which meant passing by the Ground Floor as the underagers whooted and hollered at us.  Kinda flattering but also gross.  Aurora had just moved into her new place and it was her roommates birthday - twice the reason to party!  Nate came by, and Jackman was in town for the weekend.  I got to meet Cooksy and I drank with some previous residents.  We talked and took  urlLink pictures .  Tanya stole my keys and I freaked out, oddly enough, though I was panicking, I was fine with it - I had my super orange bev.  Around 2 we left and hit up the diner.  I think I ran into a bush.  Greasy food is fabulous, though our waitress sucked.  For some reason they couldn't replace the chicken fingers with french fries.  IT'S A DINER!! Who doesn't do that!??!  She was NOT even CLOSE to our usual hip diner waitress.  Nate and I go back to my apartment and I splashed around in the pool while he called me a doofus.  Hit the sack around 4 am and oddly enough woke up at 8 on my own.  Silly Sparks.

      So tonight was the season finale of the Real World.  I am such an addict to MTV documentaries.  I don't really watch television - no time for it, but my ears will always perk up when an MTV doc comes on.  And seeing how they come on all the time, I don't need to schedule them in. :-)  I even shed a tear, OK, looking back, I didn't cry, but I did get a little misty eyed as they all said their goodbyes.  Wow - I am such a dork. Maybe because it reminds me that so many people come and go.  And now I am eating pickles out of a jar with a fork.  The dill kind, the bread and butter ones are so heinous that they shouldn't even exist.  Why do they call them "bread and butter"?!!?  Those pickles do not taste like one or the other or both.  They taste like ass.

       urlLink The evening in pictures   On Wednesday, June 23, 2004, Marlon Spike made their Baltimore debut in Baltimore's finest venue - The Funk Box.  After a week of postering, distributing CDs, and talking it up, we presold quite a number of tickets, though a bit less than our goal.  Which we definitely could have done if it wasn't mid week in the summer.  Next time.  Dan drove Tanya, Sarah, ad myself down to Baltimore, arriving much earlier then needed, which was good for my anxiety when it comes to times.  We loaded in Dan's stuff and merch then headed out for dinner while we waiting for the rest of the posse.  Dinner was good and I think Chris had ice cream.  The guys soundchecked as I ran around like mad upstairs getting everything that the Funk Box needed organized.  I've missed this and it was pretty damn awesome.  They filled the fridge in the green room with goodies and a good preshow time was had by all.  Met some cool new people and, um, yeah, Tanya and I tested our tolerance.  The girls made fine use of the rooftop view.  Jen was able to come down for an hour or so and hang out.  Which was just dandy.  And I even got photo doc of her snazzy CNN laminate.  Aw, laminate.    Marlon Spike had a phenomenal show.  It sounded great and looked even better.  The crowd was scattered throughout the venue and of course we stood about 10 feet from the stage, no closer.  I think I am now banned from Chris' camera because it scares me.  I nearly lost it when Sark told Chris to "hold tight big boy" because he wasn't ready.  Shortly afterwards, Dan needed more juice for his bass and darted off the stage and upstairs.  Ahh fun.  They also edited their in between song banter due to the presence of the parents.  A couple that Aurora introduced me to later danced up a storm near the front of the stage.  They told me that they try to dance at every performance they see, then the man proceeded to tell me about the resurgence of the lambada in certain NYC clubs.  He then showed me.  Also met Herb from the Grog & Tankard.  What a great night to meet all sorts of new people.  I also met a nice guy from an area band, but I totally forgot his name and band.  I just know that they are playing the Grape sometime before the end of summer.  So I guess I'll find out soon enough.  After Marlon Spike played, I ran upstairs so I could grab my bag and notebook of life, as well as use the restroom.  The door was open, and I was looking down, so I walk in.  I look up and see two guys from the other band utilized the same facility.  That is all I am going to say.  First off, it was a one room large bathroom, second - WHO DOES THAT!?!  My mouth dropped and I scmapered to our dressing room to grab my stuff.  I didn't get a chance to escape before one of them asked me if I smoke.    I drove home with Aurora and showed her the essence that is Sheetz.  We agree that it is not as great as Wawa.  We win against the LDE guys.  Ours is better.  Sheetz is way too colorful and like an amusement ride.  Where Wawa is all about quality.  :-)  It is still way better than BP.

      Last night I went to see the Annie Lennox/Sting show at Camden's Tweeter Center.  I never have that much to write after I see a big show, it just doesn't encompass what the smaller dirty shows do.  Sting is definitely artist you have to see at least once, and seeing how I am a huge fan of the Police, it was fitting that I went.  I am not as familiar with his solo stuff as I am with the band stuff, it was all enjoyable.  Synchrocity has to be one of the best albums ever.    I'm such a dork when I go to big shows like this, I'm partly in the music and partly in the visual effects and videography.  Sometimes I want to go over the the director and shake him when I see their work displayed on the screens.  But Sting had an amazing visual show, one of the best I have seen in a while.  And he played "Fields of Gold" which is my favorite Sting / non Police song.  I was lying in the grass, shoes kicked off, staring up at the starless sky, listening and it reminded me of my birthday.  I spent it with Karen, Mark Williams, Michael Alban, & JonaSteve in Baltimore.  Michael sounds so much like Sting its scary.  And Mark and I were at the trunk of his car for ever while he found my Sacred Love and Elvis Costello CD.  At the trunk he went into this rant on how much he disliked the CD.  I was spun around on the docks...and last night reminded me of that evening.

      Two Thursdays ago, there was no better place to be than New York City...  Akiva had told  me about this show he was setting up in this sweet lounge and promised that ot would be a great evening.  And it was!  (and if you already read the Akiva board, most of this is cut and pasted from there because I didn't feel like writing the same info twice)  Aurora and I were going to go early and shop, but the roads had other plans.  We spent 90 minutes driving around New York City trying to find a decent place to park and running over pedestrians.  Luckily Graham serenaded us and I screamed out of the window that I just wanted to get the hell out of my car.  We decided to just park and eat - no shopping.    The place was really nice and our waitress was fabulous.  She had a nifty accent.  Our company was a nearby table of diplomats.  We eavesdropped into some of their conversation pertaining to fundraising and certain celebrities.  The lounge had ambiance, but what made the evening amusing was the background music.  The loud background music of the latest hip hop and rap songs.  Such as the unedited version of "Roses" (which we were talking about during the car ride) and the unedited version of "Put It In Your Mouth".  And roases played twice in a row.  Ken and Jodie met up with us during the second spin.  Followed shortly by Steve, Katie, Aimee, and Maryellen.  I think Aimee and I freaked Steve out because he forgot we knew each other.  I blamed Steve for giving me pink eye and contemplated what he did while he was in my room to give it to me when Ken said that Steve has a constant problem with pink eye.  I assume that Steve has a syringe of pink eye germs and uses it whenever necessary.  I think he shot me in the eye.  Anyways...  Saw Mr. Dave Pittenger and I think he was shocked to see me since I have known him for quite a while and haven't seen him play yet.  Said hi to Akiva, and we all made our way into the back room.  Aurora said it felt like a sleepover - there were tons of wall chairs and huge cushions.  And everyone pretty much knew each other, which made it even better.  As always, its cool to see Steve from Green to Think play solo shows - they are more low key then the GTT stuff and is always entertaining. Such as when he used the mic to push his glasses back up.  Steve also couldn't finish a song because he couldn't see his guitar.  It was quite hilarious. He took requests from Ken, so Ken asked him to play Dear Urgency, which is my favorite of the new songs.  Maryellen and I were dorks and sang the backing vocals and harmonies during "We Are Stars".    I was *really* impressed with Brian Sendrowitz and would have bought his CD then if I didn't have to worry about enough cash to get out of the parking lot and coffee for the trip home. Now I have an excuse to see him live again.  He reminded me of David Gray, Damien Rice, and Johnathan Rice.  Ken and I were texting back and forth during the show since he was sitting across from me.  Brian was telling a story as Ken was reading the text I sent him about my strategically placed bandaids.  Ken's jaw dropped and he laughed out loud at exactly the inopportune time during Brian's story.  We both turned red and Steve stole Ken's phone and ran off.  I was also really impressed with Dave Pittenger. He busted out some tunes on the keyboard and guitar and all were enjoyable.  Even his covers.  And I don't think he messed up his songs - haha.  Dave brought his video camera, so of course I was camera girl, but I think the venue was too dark.  Hopefully some of the footage can be used.    And of course Akiva rocked the house and well worth the numb ass from sitting down for three hours.  We forgive him for playing songs twice. The new stuff sounds good - and the sex song is great - haha.  And I like the Mississippi song a lot.  And track ten was played, though it wasn't written like that on the setlist.  Aurora and I will have shirts.  I promise.  And we will have Swift shirts.  It's like a secret society.    After the show we talked about porn then dodged out around 1 am.  Spent about an hour getting out of the city - all for Dunkin Donuts.  We got our iced lattes and headed for the highway.

      I'm at work now, listening to the Aware Greatest Hits CD.  It is repeating itself on track one, which is John Mayer's "My Stupid Mouth", which reminds me of freshmen year in college.  I was in Grotto's with Michelle and she had said this was becoming her favorite song by him and how she hoped it wouldn't become a single.  It was our secret society with random Comfortable quotes in our away messages and no one knew who "jm" was.  Ha.  Track two...Tabitha's Secret.  Wow, I remember them when they were Tabitha's Secret.  Known to most of you as Matchbox 20.  This CD is like a timewarp through the past few years.  When Raf put this CD in today, I told him that Aware is one of the best things to have happened to music.

      "I'll never be a slut. I can tell you that much. I can tell you that will never happen."  - juliana hatfield  Wednesday is the Juliana Hatfield show at the Northstar Bar.  Woo woo - I am way excited.  She's the first artist that I liked and really got into.  "Become What You Are" is a perfect power indie pop rock CD and one of the first CDs I bought.  I may have even bought the tape.    What is even more exciting is that she has two fiiiiine openers - The Damnwells and The Jane Anchor.  Ryan sent me over to the Damnwells way a while ago and I really dug their stuff then and think that the recently released album is great.  I would have been content with that bill until I found out that The Jane Anchor was also added on.  John, Dave, and Joann from IKE are also in the Jane Anchor.  John absolutely loves Juliana Hatfield as well.  I'm not sure how we discovered our mutual adolation, but every time she has played nearby, he has had a gig.  Now he gets to share the same stage with her.  I remember during the second half of shooting the music video we listened to Juliana's new CD all morning.  Good times.  John and I were talking the other day aboout how we hope we don't act all goofy and doubfounded in her presence.  This is going to be fantastic.  :-)  Oh yeah, and I am guestlisted.  Rock on.  Guestlisted for a Juliana Hatfield show.  I think I can die content now.

      I really have nothing to write about.  Phantom Planet is coming back into town this week, and though I really want to go, I am not.  Then I remember that nothing will be better than the Apil 8, 2004 Phantom Planet show.  This is all about me catching up in the past few months.  A few months ago, I met someone from Warner Brothers and we talked about some bands on the label that I liked.  Most notably Pat McGee Band and Johnathan Rice, among others.  We also chatted about The Darkness and I told him how the tickets for the philly show sold out in 92 seconds - a fact I know since Dan engrained it in my mind.  So Mr. WB guy said he would try to get me tickets since he may have some industry passes.  Score!  Days later, instead of tickets to the Philly show, he told me he got me two passes to see The Darkness play their sonic session on April 2.  Woohoo!    Dan and I dodge the raindrops and head up to Indre Studios.  We stood in line forever then about 75 of us shuffled in front of the stage.  The people working it kept telling us it was going to be loud.  No shit it was going to be loud.  They gave out toilet paper for earplugs, but we wanted unadulterated rock.  It was great, we weren't cramped and we were right there.  This was the first performance Justin sang since being sick, and it sounded great.  "That guy" also made an appearance at the show.  He was wearing The Darkness shirt and was right in front.  Cool dude.  A week later, I was hooked up with Phantom Planet Sonic Session tickets, so Dan and I both dodged out of work and headed up to Khyber.  This was even better than the Darkness.  The Khyber may hold 100 people.  And Phantom Planet is wonderful.  I hadn't seen them live before this, though I have liked them for a whole now, so it was really cool seeing them in such an intimate venue.  And it was loud.  Yay for free intimate rock.

      Playing ketchup once again.&nbsp; :-) &nbsp; I think I mentioned before that last Wednesday The Jane Anchor, The Damnwells, and Miss Juliana Hatfield were playing the Northstar.&nbsp; I majorly crush the Northstar. &nbsp;  &nbsp; John Faye and I have a deep admiration for Juliana and she has pretty much inspired us throughout our careers, though obviously in different ways.&nbsp; John guestlisted me so of course this night was just getting better and better.&nbsp; When I got into the venue, I saw John and he introduced me to Kara, who knew who I was before John even said anything.&nbsp; She's the lead vocalist for The Jane Anchor.&nbsp; While they were settng up, I found Chris M. and ran into Cliff and Beth.&nbsp; They are such cool people.&nbsp; Which is another post entirely. &nbsp;  &nbsp; The Jane Anchor rocked.&nbsp; Towards the end of their set no one was near the stage so I took heed of the opportunity to sit on the side of the stage to take pictures.&nbsp; This guy standing on the green room stairs kept staring at me and I was afraid he was going to yell at me for being on the stage steps, but then I didn't care so I kept clicking away.&nbsp; The guy then comes up to me and asks if I know the band.&nbsp; I said yes, then he asks me to come downstairs.&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; Dude, Juliana could have been down there! &nbsp;  &nbsp; So he said his name was James and was just having small talk with me, then asks if I want a drink.&nbsp; Um, sure!&nbsp; So we go back upstairs through the crowds.&nbsp; Of course I have been missing for about 15 minutes by this time.&nbsp; We passed Chris and I just give him a look and I think he shook his head at me.&nbsp; We grab our drinks then go upstairs.&nbsp; His name is James and he is the soundman for The Damnwells.&nbsp; It was just funny because it was so random.&nbsp; He gts points in my book though because he said that The Jane Anchor is the best band that he has seen open up for The Damnwells.&nbsp; Oh, and I really like their new song that has the word "venus" in it.&nbsp; Kara said it will be on the new album. &nbsp; &nbsp; Chris and company and I went towards the front for The Damnwells set.&nbsp; They kinda remind me of a cross between old school Ryan Adams and Wilco.&nbsp; So damn good.&nbsp; I think the song "Sleepsinging" is amazing and they played it towards the end.&nbsp; &nbsp;   Juliana took the stage and it was greatness.&nbsp; She got a tattoo on her forearm since the last time I saw her.&nbsp; It is of a tiger.&nbsp; RAWR!&nbsp; She played a FANTASTIC mix of old and new Juliana and Some Girls songs.&nbsp; She fucking rocks, I don't know how else to say it.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      I don't even know if I should write this because I know you all are just going to hang your heads in shame...  My apartment smells like burnt plastic.  Which, if you are not familiar with the smell, it is heinous.  Why does my apartment smell like burnt plastic?  Let me tell you.  For dinner, I decided to make wheat pasta, sliced tomatoes, steamed spinach, and olive oil.  So I fire up the stove so I can boil two pots of water.  I'm at my computer when I smell something reminescent of something burning - unfortunately an all too familiar scent to me.  I look over toward my kitchen, and see smoke.  Oh man, NOT AGAIN!!  So I dash into my kitchen and see that I had left some plastic containers on one of the burners and I had turned it on to the top notch.  I struggled trying to pry the melted containers off the burner, but I won.  Ok, so I turned two burners on, just one of them was not for the two pot occupied burners.  Ok, I want you all to look at your stoves.  Of the four burner knobs, do they go front left, front right, top left, top right OR front left, top left, top right, front right?  I thought my stove was the first set up, not the second.  It just feels natural to have the two front ones first, then the back ones.    Well I sure learned a lesson today.

      The road to an Omnisoul show beckoned again Tuesday afternoon.&nbsp; Since I am pressed for time, as always, I will cut and paste some of Matt's wonderful review and add my comments...   "Tuesday’s show at the tweeter center was a blast. My friends and I took the long way to the venue and ended up getting there later than the expected 5pm start. It was Miranda’s first time on the patco speedline! Turns out, however, that the whole event started late and the band went up to play at around 6pm. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   The crowd was filled with music enthusiasts. The opener, Not Alone, was pretty entertaining. Their guitarist was really laying down some hot riffs and they were warming up the crowd for an extremely energetic omnisoul performance. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Unlike the last full band show, Tuesday’s show was highlighted by amazing sound. Never have I heard such a perfect band mix for an outdoor show. Mike Tate kicks butt. In Scare the Night, I actually heard both Josh’s AND Jamie’s solos. Amazing tone! In addition to making the band sound as great as they are, Mike was also “balloon tech,” tending to the mylar balloons that gravitated towards Derek’s face and Tyler’s cymbals. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   “My Own.” Enough said. Well, maybe not if you weren’t there. This song completely energized the crowd. Every band member was spot-on and Mike had Shawn cranked up during his screeching solo. By the end of Derek’s falsetto notes at the end of the tune, everybody in the parking lot was moving and going crazy. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   All of the free demo CD’s were gone by the middle of the set (any remaining ones were gone after Jamie blew our faces off with his trumpet solo in Home to Home). We were treated to two new songs on Tuesday: “Float on the Air” and “Rich Man.” Float on the Air is definitely going to be a keeper. It instantly went over well as if the band had been playing it for months. Rich Man has this nice funky guitar riff that Derek plays throughout the tune. Good work, guys.   The entire set was as follows: 1.&nbsp;All or None&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;Twinkle of a Life&nbsp; &nbsp;3.&nbsp;Trauma&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; The Greater You&nbsp; 5.&nbsp; Float on the Air&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel What You Want&nbsp; 7. Home to Home&nbsp; 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting&nbsp; 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Own&nbsp; 10. Another Day Gone&nbsp; 11.&nbsp;Rich Man&nbsp; 12.&nbsp;Scare the Night&nbsp; 13. No More Love Songs   I thought it might have been nice to close with Happy Outside, but the evening had started to wear on and some people were ready to go see the dmb concert at the tweeter. I wonder why the band doesn’t play Happy Outside more often... are they afraid that it’s too menacing? I guess I only get a little frightened when I hear the album version....&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Several highlights stuck out in my mind. When the guys played Waiting, it was just as a cop car pulled up next to the fence behind the band. They just sat there and listened to the song as oodles of people sung along wit the words. It was fun. Perhaps another interesting subtlety that went down was Josh singing the voice-unders in Another Day Gone that will end up on the new CD. In the big heavy section towards the end of that song, Derek can be heard speaking the lyrics to the song before he sings them. It’s a nice haunting effect. Josh did these during the show and it was fun if anybody noticed it. Not that I expect anybody else to be a stalker fan that recognizes any note of any song, but it was funny anyway. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   Speaking of the new CD, I have heard some recent cuts of it and I know that everybody will be beyond impressed. The recordings have blown me away. On Tuesday, there were flyers circulating regarding the CD release – set for August 14th. Oddly enough, one of these flyers ended up right on Derek’s own windshield... I don’t know which is more ironic – that flyer, or the singer of Not Alone trying to get me to sign up on the omnisoul mailing list. I politely declined! Hee hee"   I agree!!&nbsp; I do have other highlights to add...&nbsp; Katie jumping over the Patco railings to ride the train after it didn't accept her card.&nbsp; Watching Derek pass out flyers then wake up Tyler with waving a flyer in front of his face.&nbsp; A flyer flew in my direction so I slid it under Derek's windshield wipers.&nbsp; Derek telling jamie to not sit on his car.&nbsp; Chris M. drinking Guiness in a can from a paper bag.&nbsp; The fuzz not patrolling but watching the Omnisoul show.&nbsp; The balloons decidiing that they wanted to join in on the show.&nbsp; Heat exhaustion!   The police patrolling in the van decided to be dicks and drive right through the crowd.&nbsp; As they passed I noticed the side of the van, which had the phrase "providing the community a better quality of life."&nbsp; I laughed and pointed it out to Chris, who then ran after the truck waving his beer saying that to provide him a better quality of life, they should give him more beer.&nbsp; It was great.   After the show we headed back to the Patco then Collingswood.&nbsp; En route, Matt and Katie took me to the Bowie Diner.&nbsp; It's not called the Bowie diner and I was wondering why they called the diner that, but I didn't ask.&nbsp; I knew as soon as I walked in, and confirmed it with them.&nbsp; One of the waitresses looked exactly like David Bowie.&nbsp; Unfortunately I missed the face of death.&nbsp; They approved of my diner choice of an egg salad sandwich, but shook their heads when I opened up the menu.   On the way home we listened to the Omnisoul CD while analyzing the tracks.&nbsp; Seriously kids, brace yourselves... Another good road trip experience for the books.&nbsp;  &nbsp; urlLink More pictures can be found here...

      So I went to a strip club the other night.&nbsp; And after that statement, I am speechless.&nbsp; It was supposed to be a group of us, pretty much just me and the guys, but at the last minute, it ended up just being Rob and me...   I honestly have no idea where to start or what to write.&nbsp; So I guess I will start at the end.&nbsp; I was talking to a stripper on what a "couch dance" was because they kept saying that phrase.&nbsp; I was wondering what the difference between a lap dance and a couch dance was, is the victim horizontal?&nbsp; Before the girl could even answer, Rob said I was going to&nbsp;do it.&nbsp; WHAT!??!?!??!&nbsp; Before I could even say anything, the stripper grabbed my hand, Rob paid her, and said the famous last words - "can I watch?"&nbsp;   So Martini brings me over to the couch and asks if I am into girls.&nbsp; I said no, which I think eased her a bit and she probably just assumed that Rob and I were into voyeur stuff.&nbsp; Before she took me in, she kept referring to me as Rob's girlfriend.&nbsp; We corrected her by saying that Rob was married, and not to me.&nbsp; I guess she thought it was hot and we were hiding something, because she went at it.&nbsp; I think my fear heightened when I was sitting down, she positioned me so Rob could watch, and she slaps my leg and says "spread 'em, honey."&nbsp; Oh no!   You get your couch dance for a song, and I swear the song must have been the longest song ever.&nbsp; Martini did things to me that I couldn't even imagine.&nbsp; I was trying to not think about it, so I was looking at Rob and he was astonished, which made me laugh.&nbsp; Hopefully I didn't offend Martini.&nbsp; At one point, Rob had to leave.&nbsp; He said he couldn't watch anymore.&nbsp; He came back...and the rest will be in his words...   "The worst part of the dance was when Martini grabbed Miranda's chest, looked at me, and then licked her lips.&nbsp; I didn't know what to do.&nbsp; Then Paris came at me and blocked my view.&nbsp; I tried to step around her, then she asked if I thought this was hot.&nbsp; I said 'no', saw the look of hurt on her face, then said 'yes', then said 'no! I'm married'.&nbsp; Paris then thought something else so I told her that I would tell her later.&nbsp; When would I tell her later!??!&nbsp; I'm not going to tell her later!!!!!&nbsp; Martini was done with Miranda and we ran out of the club and into the car and didn't say anything to each other till we were almost home.&nbsp; I went home and drank.&nbsp; I drank straight vodka and had nightmares."   It was very traumatic.&nbsp; Rob told me&nbsp;I grew about three inches from stiffening up in fear during my couch dance.&nbsp; I also had nightmares.&nbsp; There is nothing more to say.&nbsp;

      After a long night in NYC and a long stretch of driving, I also had to wake up early to take care of my horses on Friday.&nbsp; Tony got to stretch out on the futon and sleep in while I worked, ugh.&nbsp; After I came home, he gave me mega support during my Maverick phone call and it was fabulous.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Tony also works at WVUD, so we trekked to the station to have a train wreck of a show.&nbsp; The music wasn't bad, but our bantering was hilarious.&nbsp; Seriously, who names their kid ESPN!?!&nbsp; Of course we are gonna shoot it down.&nbsp; Afterwards i beg Dave to pick us up early so we can spend more time in Wawa then go see Jen earlier. &nbsp; We leave a bit before 6 and hit up Wawa to chose our dinner.&nbsp; Which um, Bruno, is far better than Sheetz.&nbsp; You know its gonna be a good evening when I hit up the counter with a large Wawa coffee (dark roast, vanilla cream, 3 blue packets, black lid, red straw) in one hand and a Rockstar energy drink in my left.&nbsp; I could feel the shakes already!! En route, I made hone calls to my mom, Mark, and Jim then we headed off to um, Sheetz for gas.&nbsp; And mentos.&nbsp; We hit up the mint and the strawberry.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I was feeling pretty ill from mentos overload when we got to Jen's.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; Her place is super nice!!!&nbsp; And it was all decorated in purple and green - yay!&nbsp; It was great visiting her and seeing that she is doing well in her new environment and job.&nbsp; Even though we try to talk mostly everyday, I know we will always have a great friendship and fabulous time together.&nbsp; And its only just begun. &nbsp; We head off to the Iota and I think we drove the boys nuts.&nbsp; And we actually screamed when Dave pulled a massive u-turn.&nbsp;  &nbsp; We get to the venue and drinks were had.&nbsp; As well as making fun of others.&nbsp; I swear, those chicks were fugly and they went into the stall together.&nbsp; And seriously, its July, don't be wearing clothing that I can pet.&nbsp; Fuzzy wuzzy.&nbsp; And um, that look is mesmerizing.&nbsp;  &nbsp; John Faye finds us and we chat then make our way towards the stage so we can celebrate Super Suga's birthday in true Delaware fashion.&nbsp; Welcome Home was of course, the opener.&nbsp; So we sing and dance and drink and have a fabulous time.&nbsp; I think Dave Anthony laughed at us.&nbsp; Or maybe he was smiling.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp;  &nbsp; We go to leave and the lead singer of The Argument says "you're miranda!" in which someone...tony? jen? dave? had an interesting reply to the effect that this always happens.&nbsp; So we said hello then went on our merry way to getting lost in DC.&nbsp; Ohh I think I even said something out the window to some people in DC.&nbsp; Oh no!! I think I may have called someone a douche out the window!!!&nbsp; Oh I feel bad.&nbsp; Please tell me I didn't do that!! &nbsp; Haha and we also saw pandas.&nbsp; Pandas pandas everywhere!&nbsp; I think we dropped Jen and Tony off around 3 and we made it home around 5 am.&nbsp;

      Too much fun to be had in the city!&nbsp; Aurora and I have known for a while that LDE was going to be playing Tribeca on July 8th and it was imperative that we be there.&nbsp; It was an added bonus that Akiva and Dave Pittenger were playing together the same night in NYC as well.&nbsp; No excuse not be in the big apple! &nbsp; My ass was quite wrecked from the night before so we left a little bit later than we anticipated, but still enough time to hit Wawa before leaving.&nbsp; We listened to tunes and caught up on our July 4th weekend and made it to Hoboken in fine time.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; Hopped the subway and made it into the city without a plan or destination.&nbsp; We emerged at 33rd and wandered around not knowing where the hell we were or where to go but that was the fun of it.&nbsp; We found some stores and shopped...compliments of Maryellen.&nbsp; Gotta love text messaging.&nbsp; Phil called me while we were in H&amp;M and they were heading into the tunnel.&nbsp; I can't beleive the boy called me to get directions to places in the city.&nbsp; Does he not know that I am the worst ever at that?!&nbsp; Our conversation impelled me to laugh at the people who shop at Dress Barn and made me run smack into this woman who wasn't very happy.&nbsp; Oh well. &nbsp;  &nbsp; Aurora and I decided to do the touristy thing and head to Time Square.&nbsp; We were also on a mission to find the NY map from the New Yorker.&nbsp; We thought it would be an easy find.&nbsp; YEAH RIGHT!!&nbsp; But it sent us into a scavenger hunt throughout the city.&nbsp; We had lunch at the nicest deli ever and trespassed into a ritzy hotel.&nbsp; We also enjoyed Coldstone which probably wasn't the best idea we ever had.&nbsp; We knew we had to end up at 1st and 50th so we just kept walking that direction hitting up every store en route trying to find this map.&nbsp; NYC was winning the scavenger hunt until a nice book man told us that it was available online and we wouldn't find it in the city.&nbsp; Oh yay, we tied with the city!&nbsp; So we hit up the subway again onward to Azaza.&nbsp; Or so we thought.&nbsp; We got on the train and two stops later the train stopped due to a downed train ahead of us.&nbsp; So instead of sitting there, we decided to hoof it.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; We got to see Saks Fifth Avenue and a pretty church across the street from it.&nbsp; The looooooong walk finally ended at Azaza where we were tired and disgusting.&nbsp; So of course the first person we see is Akiva - so hopefully we didn't smell too bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous time at Azaza I used bandaids, this time I seriously glued my shirt to myself.&nbsp; Too bad Ken wasn't there to exchange texts.&nbsp; We collapse on the cooshy&nbsp;seats and watch the music.&nbsp; We were afraid we were going to miss Akiva, but he told us that him and Dave were going to switch off the entire night.&nbsp; Oh yay.&nbsp; And of course Aurora and I texted each other during the performances because there was just too much to say. &nbsp; We left around 9:45 to hit up Tribeca.&nbsp;  &nbsp; We cab it and&nbsp;I think it may be the first time&nbsp;in NYC history that the&nbsp;cabbie had no idea where our destination was.&nbsp; So I call up Phil and he gives us the intersection, which actually isn't that obscure.&nbsp; Church and Warren?! &nbsp; &nbsp; We get there and "help" LDE set up.&nbsp; Or watch.&nbsp; Whichever.&nbsp; Chris let me hold his precious guitar, and I did a better job then he did.&nbsp; I didn't come close to dropping it!&nbsp; Aurora also did a fine job of securing the percussion stuff.&nbsp; I don't think Brian thinks I am an ass anymore, or maybe he is just nicer to me now.&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp; But it was cool.&nbsp; The guys, except for Doug, had on black shirts and jeans.&nbsp; It was like a uniform, and we definitely called them out on it.&nbsp; They rocked and it was fun.&nbsp; Playing all originals and new stuff.&nbsp; Their last song was kinda lame, but we are still supportive.&nbsp; It was more like a pop punk lyrical disaster.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; I attempted some picture taking, but I didn't want to get in the way of the crowd, so I was stuck on Chris' side, which left very little room for imagination.&nbsp; I think I only got three good shots from a whole hours worth of shooting.&nbsp; Oh well, yay for digitals. &nbsp; So I got this weird call during their set, and just thought it was Tony, so I texted him.&nbsp; After LDE finished, Phil told the crowd to come see me for free discs and I was bombarded.&nbsp; After the crowd left, I checked my vmail and nearly died.&nbsp; I was speechless as Aurora asks..."tony? dave? akiva? who?!?!?" And all I can utter is "job" and we book it through the venue and out into the NYC streets.&nbsp; It was Maverick records and they wanted to know if I could come out to LA.&nbsp; Ok, so that story will be continued another time.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; So we are freaking out and I text people and people call and I am talking to Dave and Akiva calls and its hilarious because they were in the same room and I don't think they realized they were both talking to me and it was just a good few minutes.&nbsp; I run back inside the venue and run into Tony and he buys me a drink to celebrate.&nbsp; It was just so great because that whole day was spent with fabulous people and I got to see some of my favorite musicians and I was in NYC and it felt so right. &nbsp; So around 1 am we say our goodbyes and head off towards Hoboken.&nbsp; We stayed in the subway stations FOREVER.&nbsp; Aurora, Tony, and I were just being wacky.&nbsp;  &nbsp; We had to ration our Mike &amp; Ikes.&nbsp; Aurora also grabbed my spray glue (i had it with me just in case) and read off the warnings.&nbsp; Apparently you shouldn't spray it on skin.&nbsp; And it makes you delusional.&nbsp; On the subway, Aurora tells us how her brother saw the Presidents of the United States perform twice, but she pronounced it "PUSA".&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few seconds of stifled laughter, Tony said he was glad her brother has seen PUSA twice.&nbsp; In an arena.&nbsp; I don't think our passenger neighbors were entertained.&nbsp; Oh yeah, and Josie and the Pussycats and Scooby Doo rules. &nbsp; Ok, so an hour later we end up in Hoboken and head to Dunking Donuts.&nbsp; The guy was an ass, but we got our beverages and trekked to the car.&nbsp; WHICH WAS 800 MILES AWAY!! Seriously!! We almost needed another drink by the time we got there.&nbsp; So not fun walking.&nbsp; We beat the sunrise and made it to DE around 4:30am...

      Cool.&nbsp; I'm glad that my favorite Maroon 5 song of over two years is now thier single.&nbsp; Awesome.&nbsp; The CD reminds me of December 30, 2002 heading down to North Carolina.&nbsp; I pick up Mark and pop this CD in telling him its fantastic.&nbsp; Charise hates Maroon 5 and thinks they are the worst band ever.&nbsp; I disagree.&nbsp;  I trounced around Philadelphia this afternoon.&nbsp; I had on cute shoes to go grocery and jewelry shopping in.&nbsp; My blisters are not cute.&nbsp; This is why I don't wear anything aside from my black flip flops unless I must.&nbsp; Everything else hurts!!

      Joe informed me of my Miss Juliana Hatfield article in this months Maxim.&nbsp; The premise is for rockstars to make a mix CD.  Enjoy.&nbsp; By the way, I freaking love Unbusted and Verbena.&nbsp;    Burn This: Juliana Hatfield The indie rock queen fights to bring back the guitar solo. Maxim, July 2004     &nbsp;  1. “Sunset Strip” Courtney Love“I feel her pain. This song is so raw her voice sounds like a knife stabbing into flesh.”    &nbsp;  2. “H.W.C.” Liz Phair“This is a really graphic song about sex. It’s all about, basically, semen, but she makes it sound like a sweet and tender thing.”    &nbsp;  3. “Coral Fang” The Distillers“I like girls who sound like guys, and Brody Dalle sounds like a dude. Rock needs balls.”    &nbsp;  4. “Dope Nose” Weezer“Rivers Cuomo isn’t afraid to play an over-the-top old-school guitar solo. He appropriates the good elements of ’80s metal without the cheesiness.”    &nbsp;  5. “Inside of Love” Nada Surf“Great line: ‘Making out with people I hardly know or like.’ Who can’t relate to that?”    &nbsp;  6. “Us & Them” Unbusted“They’re this unsigned band from Martha’s Vineyard. The writing is really good and the frontman, Joe Keefe, is a guitar hero.”    &nbsp;  7. “Edge of the Ocean” Ivy“This is a really soothing song. It kind of feels like melted butter or a warm bath.”    &nbsp;  8. “Shake Yer Dix” Peaches“It’s like a dirty nursery rhyme for adults, or a raunchier version of Kelis’ ‘Milkshake.’ Man, I must sound like a pervert.”    &nbsp;  9. “Hound Dog” The Rolling StonesThis is from a 1978 bootleg, and it’s the punk-rockingest version of ‘Hound Dog’ ever.”    &nbsp;  10. “Vertigo” The Libertines“Just a cool, sloppy, loosey-goosey, cocky, late-night, don’t-give-a-fuck song.”    &nbsp;  11. “Ana’s Song” Silverchair“It’s so hard to find anorexia songs that rock.”    &nbsp;  12. “Dirty Goodbyes” Verbena“I don’t know why these guys aren’t massive. This is mellow, not like their other songs .”

      So let me tell you a little story.  There is this kid who plays chess outside of the coffeeshop I go to everyday and he is hot.  Days later, he comes into the store, and is still hot.  He fills out an apartment application so of course I grab it and educate myself.  Geez, the boy is *barely* legal.  Legal meaning 18, not even drinking legal.  Oh well.  So after this almost cradle robbing experience he is still out but I am so over this silent lust.   Then the word on the street is that he is moving in next door to me.  Oh hot.  I can see his porch from my porch.  Nice.  So now my friends know this silly little game because its fun.  Then they discover that he is gay.  Not just gay, but flaming, and they are all having a laugh at my expense.  Obviously nothing would have come of all this, but its pretty damn funny.   Suzanna says that he likes to parade around in his underwear though.  Hey, that is gonna be hot.

      As I am finally able to write about this, I do not feel any more at ease than I was this morning.   What I am about to write is entirely true and freaked me the fuck out.  If you know me, you know that though I do have panic/anxiety attacks, I do not get upset over much.   A little about my past...I haven't slept in the house I grew up in in Delaware since I moved completely out three years ago.  Mostly because that house is haunted and it got to the point where I couldn't even be in the house by myself, let alone sleep there.  Ever since I was younger, I have had a deeper sense of my surroundings.  I can usually read people really well without even realyy knowing them.  It is hard to explain.  Mostly everyone I know knows that I have a wicked sense of dates, but its actually a deeper unexplainable vibe.  I'm not even going to try to explain, just that I have learned to adapt to the fact that I can sense things before they happen.  Too many stories to even mention to prove that.  So I live in one of the oldest buildings in my town, but have never really been concerned with any presences.  Occasionally I think I see something hovering near where my AC is, but have just passed it off as my eyes misjudging my floor lamp.  The last time I remember thinking I felt someone and seeing someone was while talking to Maryellen and Morita on AIM some Monday night while we all watched American Idol.  I remember telling them how freaky it felt.  Nothing has occured to me here since then...until I was violently awoken last night.  I came home around 2am and went to bed around 2:30.  I was extremely tired, though I couldn't fall asleep.  I chalked it up to having too much on my mind, though Jamie did give me something to calm me down and help me sleep.  I tossed and turned and got out of bed every half hour just because I was so franticly weary.  I had just fallen asleep around 5:30 when I woke up because I was being crushed.  I couldn't open my eyes, but there was an immense weight on me.  I could hear Becca outside in the hallway and the cars on Main Street.  I was sleeping on my side and couldn't turn over because the pressure was so great.  I tried to say something, but couldn't.  I tried to scream, but couldn't even open my mouth in addition to my eyes.  I could hear Becca outside and I couldn't call out to her.  I started tearing up because I was so afraid and in pain.  Then my whole budy went numb.  I couldn't feel the weight on me anymore, and it felt like my whole body was asleep.  I tried to turn around from what was keeping me down and couldn't.  I started hyperventilating.  I honestly thought I was going to die.  I am gasping for air, crying, and wasn't able to move.  Then as quickly as it started it stopped.  Once I realized I was still alive, my first thought was that someone close to me had died and was trying to tell me.  I knew it was early morning and my mom usually wakes up super early on the weekends to take care of the horses and I thought maybe she got into a car accident.  I didn't want to open my eyes to look at my clock or grab my cell phone because I was terrified on what I might see.  So I sat in bed with my eyes shut until day broke.  While at work today, I told Rob about my adventure last night.  I told him of the pressure and the paralysis and he said he has me diagnosed.  I must have had an odd look because he followed that statement with "shadow people".  So we went on google and apparently what happened to me isn't uncommon.  Oh yeah, and while doing so, Joe - the owner of the store and my apartment, comes in and says "did you know the third floor window is open?"  Raf, Rob, and I look at each not saying a damn thing.  The only people that have keys to the third floor are Raf and I.  And neither one of us opened that damn window in the past day.  What the hell?!  I am just majorly freaked out.  I don't think I am sleeping here tonight.  I don't understand why me and why now.  My whole body is sore, and I sure as hell didn't do anything strenuous yesterday.  Every light in my apartment is on and I am jumping at every little thing.  I'm so tired, but too scared to close my eyes.
