      Every week, I tell myself that once the current week is over, the following week will be more regular in terms of a schedule.  Not so at all.  Sunday morning I woke up and went to church, and then came home and went almost immediately to work for 5 hours.  It was a pretty good day, time went by quickly.  After work a bunch of us headed to volunteer at the Hope House to play with some kids who are pretty much out of a home right now.  The toughest part for me is always leaving.  It's sad to be able to go home to lots of blessings and walk away from what they're going through.  I spent some time with Alex's family later that night and came home and fell into bed.  I'm exhausted, I really am.  This morning I kinda slept in, but I still had to go into work.  It went by quickly again for the most part.  I had a very interesting conversation at work with a customer.  As usual, no one was there after 6 p.m. until this elderly man came in to buy tomato plants.  He came to the register to check out, and he was about to leave when he realized he's left his cane in the greenhouse.  He launched into all his health problems, which were quite extensive, including heart surgery, hernias, arthritis, and more.  Then he said, "If I die, eh, I die."  He told me then that he had been married for 53 years and his wife had passed on a few years earlier.  He said he often had dreams about her, and in them she didn't really talk to him, but  said very few words.  The man said he thought perhaps this meant that she was asking him to listen more closely for the time to join her in heaven.  He said he wished the Bible would tell him if he'd really get to spend eternity with the one he loved, but it didn't.  But he said he would try to have faith that he'd be with her again.  I told him faith was believing without seeing, and he agreed.  The whole conversation was very sad.  To me, one of most depressing events in life is the death of a longtime spouse.  It's the person you share everything with and then they're gone.  While our conversation was sad, I was glad I had met that man and discussed topics like heaven and the Bible, it really made me think.  When I closed the store, I came home and talked for a long time with my mother about the busy week coming up and I began choreographing the opening number for Junior Miss.  So much to do this week!  Tomorrow the lifeguarding job starts, and my first rehearsal for Junior Miss is later at night.  Wednesday I am helping to interview candidates for a math teacher at SM, and then I work at Van Becks in the afternoon.  Thursday I have a doctor's appointment, and possbily working at the lifeguarding job.  Friday I work at Van Becks, and Saturday I have to be in a Fourth of July parade waving my arm off.  But that night should be fun, my family is going out on the boat to watch fireworks.  So another week of not having a relaxing summer.  One day I will! OK, most likely night.  Ah well, what can you do...it does make me a little sad though, I need an afternoon of laying in the sun being lazy.  Saturday maybe, in between the parade and the boat thing.  That'd be so nice.  Sigh.  Anyway, I hope this week is fun and not just stressful...I have lots of my own projects outside of work to get done and lot of thank-you notes to write.  Grrr.  I'm going to have to plan this out really well to get it all in.  And I really want my roomate assignment! That should come this week.  Well I think it's off to bed, Job #2 starts at 7:30 a.m. tomorrow morning.

      Playing catch up for the last few days here.  Thursday began with breakfast at 6:30 a.m. with Gartmann.  He was off to begin the trek to West Point late that night.  We went to Andrea's and we talked about being so far away from home, new classmates, and stuff like that.  It was sad to see him go, but I am so proud of him.  Seriously - West Point!  It will be so great to hear about his experiences when he comes home.  After we'd said goodbye, I headed to my lifeguarding class to take my written exam.  I passed and realized how much I had learned from the whole thing.  All that was left then was the water exam the following day.  After class I had to work though, and it was so slow.  I think I had like 20 customers all day.  There was no need to be open until 8 p.m. at all.  But it was kinda nice to have nothing to do but straighten up the place.  After work I flew home to shower and get ready for the fireworks.  Alex had told me he's come up with the perfect spot to watch fireworks but wouldn't tell me where.  He wound up taking me to his house and he'd made dinner for us, which we took up to his roof for a view of the show.  I'm slightly afraid of heights but once I was up there I was fine.  Well, unfortunately, the fireworks were not that visible.  My sister told me later she went to a random park to watch them, too, and no one could see them either.  But it was still really fun, eating dinner on top of a roof in the middle of the night.  Overall I had a really nice time.  The next morning though, I had to get up for my water test for lifeguarding.  We were each given three scenarios where someone might be drowning and we had to perform appropriate rescues.  It went really well.  The first time for each scenario was kindof like a practice, and if you did well you didn't have to do it over, but otherwise you had one more shot.  So for one of my scenarios, I freaked out because half way through my examiner switched the kind of victim she was, intitally she'd been at the surface and she suddenly submerged.  So I had to go back and do that one.  Otherwise, everything went great and I passed my test!  I'm excited to start working for Van Ert.  This whole experience really pushed me to do a lot of things I'd deemed myself incapable of.  I'm really glad I did this.  When I got home from class Ben and I went for a run.  I was tired from swimming and lack of sleep but nevertheless, we headed out.  I think it's really a good thing to have a partner because they push you to keep going.  We did a cool down walk and started talking about bad eating habits.  It's so cool that I can tell him about those and he'll admit to his own.  And actually talking about them reminds me they're bad and I think it'll make it easier to stop.  After the run I went to see "The NOtebook" with Alex.  So good.  I really, really liked it.  It had gotten bad reiews, but it was great.  My sister said it's also a book which I'm thinking I will have to go and pickup at Barnes and Noble.  It was just a really sweet movie and I'm still thinking about it.  I love when movies do that to you. We then picked up dinner and another movie to watch.  This morning I woke up and am feeling a little sore from the run/swimming, but that's a good feeling to know I did so much yesterday.  I'm really relaxed right now and want nothing more than to fall asleep in my bed.  But I have like five places to be today all at once.  I feel really bad I couldn't get off of work and go to the concert with Katie.  I feel especially bad because our schedules haven't worked out lately and we haven't gotten to hang out much.  I hope it'll change with the new job starting and all, everything will be more regular.  Sigh.  So today it's off to work, off to a benefit for Kyleigh, and then hopefully home to sleep in...or at least until 11 because I work at noon tomorrow.  Grrr..I haven't been able to sleep in once all summer, which sucks.  Ah well, it's been busy and somewhat fun.  Off to help clean, do junior miss stuff, and then work.

      My morning started out with completely sitting in traffic because a wine truck turned over getting off of 45 North to Bluemound Road and its contents spilled everywhere.  So I was late, which I hate and I'd been so proud of myself for being on time to this class. But class went well and I felt a really good kind of tired when it was over.  The only thing that sucked was being the victim one in a while for other people to practice on because you have to lay half in, half out of water so others can practice strapping you into a backboard.  Anyway, when class was done I did the usual shower and lunch routine.  Then I had a great conversation with Ben, it really made me smile.  He's like Fortier in a way.  Both of them make me laugh so much, and that gets me thinking funny comments in my own mind and I can't help sharing them.  The two of them make me bolder to say certain things I'd never say otherwise.  I slept all afternoon then, and woke up to the rain absolutely torenting down, I loved it.  I decided to stay in tonight and work on more cleaning/organizing projects and I'm really close to being done.  Tomorrow morning I'm going out to breakfast with Gart! He leaves for West Point tomorrow and it'll be the last chance to see him.  I'm so proud of him, everyone doubted him and he did it.  So that'll be a nice start to my day.  From there I must take my lifeguarding written exam, which will certify me in CPR and whatnot.  So right now I'm off to study a lot, I really, really need to pass.  I'd feel so bad.  I think it'll be OK but I'm freaking out like mad.  Wish me luck tomorrow and goodnight.

      So today was an OK day.  Swim class taught me how to use defibrillators, which was really cool.  They are such a good investment for schools to have, when SM got one I didn't understand why it was such a big deal but they really are awesome.  They are a computer system which takes you through a process to shock a heart that is beating incorrectly and may include CPR at the end.  Awesomeness.  Anyway, class went well and afterwards I went home, ate lunch and accomplished quite a bit in terms of what I need to get done yet in my room to make all Chrissy's redecorating plans run smoothly.  Then Alex and I went to see the Terminal, which no one else should.  It's really not good.  It isn't God-awful, but it's a very weak plot with weak symbols and a needless love story.   Tonight was a little difficult because there wasn't anything to do.  It was one of those nights you don't want to waste because it's nice out, but what is there to do?  I need to make a list of things to call upon when it's a night like this.  I guess I'm also a little stressed by various things happening here and maybe if those things were resolved I'd feel better.  We'll see what plays out.  Well, I'm off to bed I guess.

      Behind schedule with this thing as usual.  So Sunday was a pretty good day, work flew by really fast.  I was busy between cleaning the place, keeping everything stocked, and working the cash drawer.  Then I rushed home to shower and get ready for Sam, Justinn, and Ben's graduation party.  But first, I had to wrap my Dad's Father's Day gift.  I wanted to just put it on their bed so he could see if alone, not in front of everyone.  What I had done was write him a letter thanking him for all the ways he's made this year and the past 18 so great for me.  That morning I had also gone through one of our photo albums and picked out a picture of him and I from when I was about 1 or 2 years old and then I framed it in this distressed frame.  Going through that album was tough though.  It was the first time I really showed a lot of emotion over leaving to go to school.  I realized I'd miss my family, to some degree anyway.  I started to cry pretty hard, looking through all those pictures.  But in a way it was nice, I hadn't been reflecting the way everything's made me feel - graduation, no tears - and so it was a good release of some feelings.  I really needed that.  Anyway, after I prepared the gift I got ready and went to the party.  Since I'd worked all day I'd missed most of the party and everyone was mostly gone but I stayed for a bit and talked to everyone.  Then everyone went their own seperate ways.  Alex and I started watching "Bowling for Columbine" but I fell asleep! (for the nine thousanth time we've been together).  So we stopped it and it was an early night, I was asleep by like 11 on my floor because my bed is still covered in stuff to put away in my room.  Swim class today was super exhausting.  I got really frustrated carrying this guy through water.  It was very difficult to hold one of those buoyant guard things and a 200+ pound guy in my arms and swim.  It was just too big an armful.  But it feels good to workout this way, I like this tired feelin although it sucks because I have no energy after class.  One of the girls in the class is so sweet and we're starting to bond.  I was so happy because she actually had heard of AU! She knew where it was and everything.  Most people haven't because it's pretty small.  So that was a nice thing.  After I came home though, I showered, ate and completely crashed on the couch for like 4 hours.  I was so exhausted.  Tonight we finally watched the movie.  It definitely made me think about a lot of different things.  I think the director did a great job of encompassing many different angles of the issue.  So yeah.  Now that I've had my nap I'm real awake but I should try to get some sleep anyway.  Hopefully tomorrow will be better, today was pretty good but I still feel like I'm not getting everything into the day that I want to.  Oh well, it's time to sleep.

      So today was the graduation party.  I stayed up until 6 a.m. this morning, putting together a photo collage and cleaning.  I still have some photo albums to put back in order since the pages in the other ones ripped.  My room is also still a complete wreck but very much improved from last week.  Anyway, after sleeping until about 9 a.m. (I took a power nap on my floor)I got up and finished a few other projects to make the house look nice. My mom set up my collage (which she really loved) in the greenhouse and it looked very nice.  The one thing that made me mad today was that Chrissy appeared to be doing nothing but sitting on the floor in our room with Shelly and scrapbooking.  I was mad she wasn't helping.  Turns out the scrapbook was for me!  It is so nice and means so much to me.  Janelle made me one too that is absolutely adorable.  She took a bunch of pictures in my basement when I fell asleep after prom.  I love it!  The party started a little slowly and I figured everyone started out at Cotey's.  Later everyone showed up and started playing huge games of volleyball.  I was so glad to see everyone and I had a really good time.  I totally fell asleep from 11:30 to almost 2, but now I'm awake just enough to do this and then find a spot on my floor to sleep before church and then work.  Yes, my floor - my bed is covered in stuff to either put away, toss, or give to charity.  So it'll be a bit uncomfortable but I'm tough.  Not really.  Anyway, I'm psyched for another week, I'm pretty happy with the way summer's going - although it's hard because I'm tired, feeling productive outweighs exhaustion.  I have done so much so far and I'm pretty pleased with what I've gotten done.  Wow.  I can't remember the last time I said something like "psyched for another week".  So many times this year where it was like "dreading another hour of my life".  Seriously, there were not so good times.  But things appear to be looking up a bit.  Off to sleep.....

      Last night I fell asleep after hours of cleaning, so here's yesterday's entry.  Swim class is really picking up, the stuff we're learning is so important and it's really helping me to conquer some fears, such as that of blood.  I feel so much more capable of things.  After class I cleaned for hours and more hours.  I took a break to eat lunch with Alex, which was good because I got to spend time with him...but it also created more dishes to wash! But I think it was worth it.  Then later I watched "Miss Congeniality" and cleaned even more.  That movie reminds me so, so much of Junior Miss sometimes, especially the part where she gets on the bus for the first time and the director makes them sing and she's completely mortified.  My experience was very similar - when we learned a "thank you" song to sing to people donating to the program, I almost called it quits.   It's like, "here's money for your program, celebrating scholastic achievement, talent, and intelligence."  Then we turn around and sing a song that ends with a little butt-shake.  Dear Lord.  Anyway, I felt like I got alot done.  I just got back from swim and took a shower and I'm ready for one more long day of cleaning.  I need to sort through pictures, vaccuum, clean the basement, and finish off my room for good.  The picture thing is fun to me, it's all about organizing today, which, in my twisted and obsessive-compulsive mind is enjoyable.  Off to work.....

      I think I have very poor communication skills.  I cannot ever manage to explain how I feel and I can't sort things out reasonably.  I am feeling quite upset right now because this sort of thing happens way to often.  I'm thinking I don't like this whole "eh, catch you tomorrow" thing relationship wise.  Doing something tonight didn't even seem like an option.  Is this a good thing?  I know the other end is terrible too, being together too much is a bad thing too.  It's just not a good thing to be totally wrapped up in one person.  But I feel such a gap between us and it definitely has been discussed so I feel terrible for still feeling this way.  It's probably my fault, I should have brought up that I felt this way but I'm tired of doing that.  I start my morning so early and I have all this energy to fit so much into a day but things always seem anti-climatic.  Each day starts out with so many possiblites, I drive home from my class and the sun's out and I think, today will be an amazing day but then nothing unique happens.  Wow I feel so terrible for thinking this way but I just always feel so bad when we get off the phone or he leaves and I'm not sure why.  Tonight I stayed in and watched Bridget Jones' Diary and folded clothes from the huge diaster area I've created upstairs.  It was a depressing end to a decent day.  Maybe the case here is that one person, because he is so close to me, is taking the blame for some sort of void I feel, I don't know. I will have to think about what makes me feel this way.

      So grateful for the chance to sit down for five seconds and write this.  Monday night I couldn't, Eddie had a friend over and there was no access to the basement.  Yesterday I fell asleep on my couch.  So today, before I tackle another project I want to update this.  Monday was my lifeguarding class.  I didn't get up in enough time to jog but it's probably good I didn't, I need to conserve energy because I'm so wiped out.  The class lasts for four hours.  Monday wasn't too productive, the Red Cross requires a certain amount of hours in the course, but there wasn't much to do, so the instructor had us just stand in the shallow end and she rambled about nothing.  She's a lot like Ms. VP, the health teacher.  There definitely is valuable information to be learned; however, it's hidden behind massive amounts of rambling and breaking things down kindergarten-style.  That afternoon I came home and cleaned all afternoon, I'm really trying to get rid of lots of stuff before college because I know when it comes time to pack the less useless stuff laying around the less panicked I'll be.  I'm still tearing apart my closet.  Monday night wasn't too good and I'm not sure why.  It started out well, Alex came over and we picked up food and watched a movie.  Then Eddie came home.  Eddie and I are on very tense terms lately about his behavior.  I'm so hoping this lying thing is a phase but I don't know.  I snapped on him because after all the fights we've been getting into recently, he was still trying to find ways to aggrevate me.  But after that the night went bad.  It was late by that point and I just felt like I'd turned what could have been a nice night into one of yelling and chaos.  I felt especially bad because I'm trying to do so much this summer and when I get the chance to slow down, I want to enjoy the time and not stress about family problems or worry about what time I should really get to bed at.  I hate that feeling but it seems like it may be a common occurance this summer and I don't know if it's just my perspective on things or if this summer is just rough so far.  I don't know.  Tuesday was so tiring, but much better.  I still had the class in the morning but it was a lecture.  Actually, the lecture was worse, I'd rather be in the pool.  But regardless, it was four hours of sitting down and that was appreciated since right after that I went to work for six hours.  It was a really slow day so all I did was clean and make boxes.  I'm dreading when fruit and vegetables come in, everything gets so cluttered and people get demanding and there's so much to do when I work close.  After work I met up with Julie, Ivana, and Kavita though and we saw Ella Enchanted.  When I was younger, I loved that book so much.  It's supposed to be a spoof of Cinderella but the characters have feelings and the reader sees the building of relationships between them.  The story between Ella and the Prince in the story is so cute, I seriously read the ending once in a will because it's just so sweet.  After the movie destroyed the novel though (and I emphasize destroyed) I may just go do that.  The movie was so, so bad.  We laughed all the way through.  It was terrible and nothing at all like the book.  I was disappointed but it was great to see junior miss girls (and who else seriously carries hummus in her purse but Ivana?).  I came home after and attempted to start this entry but then my phone rang and I went to answer it upstairs and never made it back down.  I totally fell asleep while talking (so sorry Alex!) and slept on my couch all night.  I feel really bad about being so tired.  When I see people, I'm exhausted and that's not fun for anyone but the other option is not seeing people at all.  Hopefully this schedule will start working for me a little more and things will get easier.  Right now I feel really bad about the whole falling asleep thing and things seem tense.  Maybe tonight plans will come through and everyhing will be resolved.  But then again, I had high hopes last time and it made everything worse.  I feel like I'm not connecting.  Although I'm tired from another swim class (very productive today, lots of time to practice saving people), I am going to go clean.  Hopefully the frustration will cease.

      Today brought on more graduation parties.  I have to admit, they did get a little tiring today.  Both Janelle's and Katie's were fun but after a weekend of house/park hopping, I'm ready to take a break from constant eating.  Tomorrow my lifeguarding class starts.  It's from 8:30-12:30 so we'll see how the time passes, I'm worried it'll drag a bit.  But I am so grateful for a four-hour workout!  The plan is to get up at like 5:30 or 6, run for a little bit, eat a little breakfast and swim.  This way I'll be awake for the drive to this middle school near Mayfair and warmed up to swim.  Then after class, my whole afternoon if free to work on my summer projects.  Basically what I did all weekend, in between parties, was take absolutely everything out of my closet, my drawers, and from boxes underneath my bed and sprawl it all over my room.  Chrissy will be up at Camp all week (I am SO jealous!) so I'm taking advantage of her empty bed to pile clothes, scrapbooking stuff, and pictures all over it.  Hopefully by the time she gets back on Friday, I'll have a decent amount of work done.  At least enough so whatever's still laying out can be pushed aside so she can sleep.  Anyway...I'm looking forward to a busy week and the start to a hectic summer.  I just hope this isn't like every other summer where I look back and think "remember, I was going to do this and this and...".  I think this one may just be productive.  We shall see.  For now it's off to bed so I can be up early.

      Ok, I know I haven't kept up with this journal over the past week or so but it's been so hectic with school ending and graduation.  The ceremony was very nice, it was formal but yet intimate.  I liked it alot.  I surprised myself a little though by not crying.  I totally expected myself to break down.  I didn't wear any makeup underneath my eyes for fear I'd be dabbing at them all night.  I guess the ceremony just made me really excited to see what's in store for the future.  I realized high school is not the be all and end all of everything.  I also realized that I had done alot to be proud of and it was definitely time to move on and not be sad about things I wished had gone differently.  It's all in the past, I had a good time, and I'm ready for much,  much more.  I was also excited to resolve things with Dan.  Somehow things worked out perfectly and I thank God for that.  I went back to pick up my NHS stole for pictures and he was standing there minus Stephanie for once.  He came up to me, gave me a hug, told me he didn't have any hard feelings anymore, and wished me luck.  That really made me happy.  It's too bad it took over a year to do, but the point is it happened and things won't be awkward anymore.  He will always be my first love, first kiss, and first heartbreak and I'll always remember that.  But we grew away from each other and we are definitely better off apart.  So that was exciting.  Having people over after graduation was nice too.  I know everyone was tired, but it was so nice to look around and see such amazing people who I love.  I am so thankful that I found them all in high school.  
But alright.  Now it's time to plan out my summer and I started doing that this morning.  I started making a to-do list and creating a calendar of important dates and such.  I love this i-calendar thing the e-mac has.  The only problem is that after a day goes by, everything on that day erases.  But otherwise it's so great and I feel very ready to get things done this summer.  One of the most important things this summer is my great weight loss challenge.  With or without Zdero, I really want to feel more secure about my body.  I want to be able to try stuff on without critizing myself too much.  Don't get me wrong, I don't hate my body I just want to know it's in good shape.  And how else can I dominate intermural kickball?  Between workouts on my own time and lifeguarding, I think it's possible that I could look really good at the end of summer.  Not in the same way as having West Point kick my ass like Gart, but decent shape would be good.  My lifeguarding class starts Monday morning.  I really want to start that day with everything, with a little dieting, running in the morning, and of course swimming.  So hopefully at the end of summer, this journal will show the course of progression for me.  I'm really going to work to keep this updated with how I'm doing.  Today it's a couple more graduation parties and I want to start tackling things like my room, packing everything away so Chrissy can have more space to redecorate while I'm gone at school next fall.  Then Monday morning, I hope I'll fine strength to wake up and move.  I'm worried.  There's so much I want to discover about myself this summer and so much I want to improve upon.  My points of view, my body, my habits - everything is under a little construction and I really hope it goes well.  Wish me luck.

      I'm really very tired but this journal is important to me, I want to learn to tackle how I'm feeling a little better.  Right now, as I look back on today, I feel alright.  I went to see Harry Potter with Ben, which was so much fun.  Afterwards we seriously talked for a good four hours.  I talked to Alex after Ben left and I have to admit it brought my mood down a little because it reminded me of how distant we have been all week.  I'm thinking that is mostly my fault, I was very bitchy in the beginning of the week.  But I apologized and hoped things would feel less tense between us, but to me they don't.  I'm very tired of feeling like we need to discuss the relationship but it makes me sad.  Sometimes I just want to force him to slow down and look at me.  I feel like we just see through each other sometimes.  Hopefully tomorrow night will go well, it will be the first time we've spent quality time together, it won't just be for like half an hour in between our schedules.  I'm glad we're both busy, it makes us well-rounded people but I wish we weren't so distant during stressful times.  We shall see what happens.  Tomorrow will be a busy day, I have a lot to do this weekend - lots of projects - graduation speech, class registration, German project, and senior pictures.  I also want to set some long-term goals for the summer - it is definitely time I found ways to feel better about myself and cope with everything.  Wish me luck.

      I know I probably should have started this journaling thing alot sooner, but I guess I was just sortof waiting to feel better.  I used to keep a prayer journal where I would set down everything that was on my mind but it got to the point where I just couldn't find the time to do it everyday.  There's alot of things that I used to make time to do but somehow it never works out anymore.  Mostly I just get really frustrated with everything I'm supposed to be doing to make everyone happy and I wind up falling asleep.  I guess I'm having such a hard time right now for that very reason.  I can't seem to enjoy anything that's happening right now in terms of the year ending because I can't pretend I'm not disappointed in myself for not being or doing more in high school.  I had so many goals that I'm sorry I didn't acheive.  I just don't feel like I'm enough and it hurts to look back on everything.  I always think about where I caused things to go wrong and what should have been done differently.  My biggest fear is that I won't learn from this and I'll mess up my chances in college.  It makes me so sad to think about, to the point where I don't really want to go for fear of disppointing myself and others.  I've especially always been afraid of making my parents upset and this time the pressure is even more intense because a great deal of money is also on the line.   I just generally feel upset at myself and am so sad because I don't know that I will ever reach a point where I am happy.  I hate being the way I am, I really do.  I feel like, if I was happy with myself, then I could be a better friend, girlfriend, daughter,etc.  Going to school is tough because it makes me deal with lots of people I wish I could make happier and in turn, enjoy more.   I feel awful about myself but you can never really offer that up as an excuse.  I can't begin to describe to anyone the way I hate myself.  When anyone asks what's wrong it's so much easier to blame it on anything else going on.  So the challenge now is how do I start to like myself even if and when I screw up in the future?  But how do I also guarantee me not making stupid mistakes?  I just wish I could fix everything.  Hopefully this is a good first step, laying everything out like this.  I just don't really know where to go from here.

      I'm trying to tell you something about my life
Maybe give me insight between black and white
And the best thing you've ever done for me
Is to help me take my life less seriously
It's only life after all

Well darkness has a hunger that's insatiable
And lightness has a call that's hard to hear
I wrapped my fear around me like a blanket
I sailed my ship of safety till I sank it
I'm crawling on your shores
I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
And the less I seek my source for some definitive
The closer I am to fine
The closer I am to fine

And I went to see the doctor of philosophy
With a poster of Rasputin and a beard down to his knee
He never did marry or see a b-grade movie
He graded my performance, he said he could see through me
I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind
Got my paper and I was free
I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
The less I seek my source for some definitive
The closer I am to fine
The closer I am to fine

I stopped by the bar at 3 a.m.
To seek solace in a bottle or possibly a friend
And I woke up with a headache like my head against a board
Twice as cloudy as I'd been the night before
And I went in seeking clarity.
I went to the doctor, I went to the mountains
I looked to the children, I drank from the fountains
Yeah we go to the doctor, we go to the mountains
We look to the children, we drink from the fountains
Yeah we go to the Bible, we go through the workout
We read up on revival and we stand up for the lookout
There's more than one answer to these questions
Pointing me in a crooked line
The less I seek my source for some definitive
The closer I am to fine
The closer I am to fine
The closer I am to fine

      Talk about a terrifying dream.  I had a bunch of truly awful nightmares last night in my sleep.  It was a very restless night and I drove to work not feeling so well.  It was a very depressing morning.  Swimming lessons went well though, William, the kid who believes he's Harry Potter, always cheers me up.  After guarding for 5 or so hours, I drove to Van Beck's to work there for 5 hours, too.  I actually enjoyed it today at the farm because there was so much work to do cleaning wise that I wasn't bored.  I was straightning up non-stop so there was plenty to do.  After work I showered quickly and played Risk with Duellman, Alex and his sister, and Havey.  Ben stopped by too.  I felt bad because I didn't have the energy to keep up with them.  They were all so into it.  It was kindof amazing, usually they are all so laid-back.  I think they assumed I just hated the game,but really I was wiped out and hadn't even had a chance to eat all day.  The game ended and we headed home.  I am off to bed shortly, tomorrow will be another long day.

      Well I had a weird night.  I sorted through photos and straigtened up my room.  Then I had a phone call so I took it in the greenhouse.  And totally fell asleep when I was done.  There was actually a sleeping bag in there from the camping trip my parents took and I curled up inside of it and the next thing I knew it was the middle of the night and I  had no idea where I was.  But today turned out pretty well though.  I went to work and taught swim lessons as usual, although I had a couple of more advanced classes today.  I also had to kick some boys out of the pool for pulling each other's swim trunks down and beating each other up.  It was like a time-out, I made them stay out for half an hour.  Other than that work was pretty normal.  After work I went home, ate some lunch and Chrissy and I tried on bridesmaid dresses.  Well, I'm thinking I almost definitely lost weight because mine doesn't fit!  It's a little too big.  That's good news for me but bad news for my aunt or whoever is going to have to fix it in the near future.  I also need to get rid of these tan lines from lifeguarding, the dress is strapless and all.  But I'm looking forward to the wedding.  After the dress trying-on, I took a shower and got ready to meet Perris for coffee.  We met at Alterra and caught up.  It was nice to vent some pre-college anxieties.  After spending some time with Perris, I headed towards home and stopped at Alex's for a little bit. Then it was time for a movie with Junior Miss girls.  We saw "Mean Girls".  It was cute...obviously not an Oscar winner or anything but it provided us a lot of laughs.  So it was a good day.  Tomorrow I am working two jobs, 9-2 at the pool and 3-8 at Van Becks.  Yikes.  Well I think it's off to bed for me.  I am exhausted.

      I'm tired of being behind in my blog.  So this is a really condensed version.  Basically, the past two weeks have been kinda lousy.  I'm stressed out because I work all day and then come home, shower really fast, and go back out again.  I love spending time with people after work and going out to do things, but I just feel so exhausted.  Being out in the sun all day really gets you.  So the past couple weeks I've taught lots of swim lessons and gotten to know the other guards a lot better.  The kids we all teach are really cute, especially mine because I have mostly pre-beginners, so mostly all you can get them to do is kick and blow bubbles.  It rained a lot last week and Eric would always send us up to the kitchen to eat because there wasn't much else to do besides clean.  I really like everyone I work with, they are great to talk to and it's so fun to work with people my own age, as opposed to Van Beck's where everyone is like 70.  So it's been great getting to know them.
     After the Monday-Friday lessons were done, it was time for the weekend and I thought it would be great too because my parents and the rest of the family went out of town.  I was looking forward to all this time to relax on my own.  Well they left Saturday morning at 6:50 a.m. and by 7:50 a.m. I had a speeding ticket.  I thought I was in a 65 speed zone and I was doing over 70.  Turns out it was a 55 speed zone.  The police officer was really nice, but it totally wrecked my week.  I spent the rest of the time feeling guilty and dreading my parents' return.  That Saturday was supposed to be so great, too.  After work I went to South Milwaukee's Junior Miss and saw a bunch of girls from State that I hadn't seen since like March.  But I was feeling kinda lousy about the ticket and all.  I still had a good time, but there was definitely a damper on it.  Sunday I woke up early to choreograph the opening for my Junior Miss Program.  Then it was off to rehearsal to teach it to the girls.  I spent a lot of time talking to my coordinor Lisa about her niece Kyleigh who is battling leukemia.  Lisa is being so strong for that little girl and I really learned to definition of love that day.  The things Lisa held Kyleigh's had through are just unreal.  
     The rest of the week was full of more working and another Junior Miss rehearsal.  Those girls are all so talented that I seriously have no idea who will win.  Friday my parents came home, and they didn't get that mad about the ticket, thank God.  I went to bed really early not feeling well.  Saturday I was in the South Milwaukee Heritage Days Parade for Junior Miss.  It was fun to see everyone, parades are the best when you know the crowd.  After the parade I went out to lunch with my grandfather and parents, which was fun because we still had a lot of catching up to do from when they had been gone.  I came home from that and took a nap.  It was like the first nap I'd had time for all summer and although it was only half an hour, it was glorious.  Alex and I went to Zdero's graduation party.  It took forever to find but it was a good time.  The girls and I decided that since my birthday is the day before I leave, we're going to have the second annual Last Day of Summer Dinner on that day and then go dancing afterward.  I'm excited, it would be a great 18th birthday.  Sunday was Alex's graduation party, which was awesome because we played kickball!  It was a ton of fun and I think we should really do it more.  Today I got up early for work and spent the morning beginning another session of swimming lessons. Some of the kids are making real progress from last time.  Tonight I think I will stay in my house and work on a bunch of little projects that need to get done, including figuring out a meal plan.  Plus I'm going to church.  So I'm caught up!  More or less.....

      Talk about a busy week.  And a kinda bad one at that.  There were a lot of ups and downs, good times and bad.  So this goes way back to last Friday.  I was thinking of just skipping over it and writing about today, but this is my place to vent so I think that's what I will do.  Friday I worked and came home to get ready to see the musical CATS and also stop by Greenfield's Junior Miss rehearsal to practice playing Ivana's accompaniment.  The musical was very good and it was fun to see Ivana.  But I was stressed out because I knew Saturday was going to be chaotic and I had lots of things to get ready.  Saturday I basically lived out of my car.  I got up at 6 a.m. to pack my lifeguard stuff, clothes to wear to my cousin's wedding shower, and a formal gown and my medal to wear to Ivana's program.  After guarding for six hours or so, I showered at work to save time.  It was kinda fun, my boss let me use the women's golf locker room.  No one else was in there and it was nice to unwind a little after working and before rushing off to do more things.  Then it was off to my cousin's wedding shower.  I had directions; I thought I was all set.  Well, after driving for quite a while I realized I had missed the exit.  Naturally I felt stupid and turned around.  I was later than I had planned and felt awful.  It was understandable because I was coming from work and I'd never been that way before, but I was still kicking myself for not seeing the sign.  The shower was alright, it was kinda sad to see my grandma though.  She is starting to really lose her memory and she's just not herself anymore.  She used to be my solace, the person I turned to when I was down.  When I felt unloved, she would build me up with so much positive encouragment.  So it really depresses me because she's here, but in a way she's gone.  After the shower I had just enough time to stop home and say hi to my dad and talk to Kavita about meeting for Greenfield's program.  I got to Greenfield and dropped off my dress backstage.  The program went very well, but as with all Junior Miss events, there was some akwardness.  Sue Herman, our state chairperon, sat with us girls and I couldn't help but get upset.  The reason she upsets me is that, despite being a nice woman who puts together a great program, she doesn't have the guts to stand up to Ceil, my host mom at State.  As my program for Oak Creek is begininng, I am supposed to be telling those girls that State Week is the most fun they will ever have.  And I know that the potential for that is there.  But living with a crazed pageant coach who makes you try on your dress for the program at 10:30 p.m. after a twelve hour day filled with rehearsals, performances, and community service only to be critical is frustrating and discouraging.  I would have loved to live with a different set of host parents.  I truly believe I would have taken away an entirely different experience.  I have been told that I am not the only girl to have problems with the Schwalbachs.  Other girls at State have suffered as well, but they won't stop Ceil from having a house full of girls because she contributes so much to the program.  That to me is very wrong.  I can't believe Ceil is worth it enough to destory a possibly wonderful experience for so many girls.  Whew.  So that was my vent.  After Ivana's program we went to Kavita's like us local Junior Misses always do and talked about State and Nationals and the positives and negatives.  Julie wasn't there that night and I think maybe that was why I left sortof depressed.  She is usually the one to get us to lighten up I think.  It had been a long day full of driving and dressing up and all I wanted was to crash.  
     But Sunday was another day of driving and doing too much again.  I woke up and immediately got ready to go out to lunch to celebrate my grandma's birthday and say goodbye to my cousin and her fiance before they headed back up to Minnesota.  The lunch was a little akward.  I am right in the median age of all my cousins and I'm not quite sure what role I really have.  The cousin closest to me in age is the one getting married and she's 24.  Her brothers are in their late 20s and 30s.  So I don't know where I fit, with the older cousins or with my brother and sister.  With my siblings I feel such a gap too, because I'm off to college and all.  So it was weird.  After lunch it was off to work again.  I stayed until close and it was a fairly decent night, not too busy or anything.  We actually closed an hour early.  I came home to work on thank you notes and my essays for the SPA leadership program.  But I wound up falling asleep.  It had been a pretty non-stop weekend, so I couldn't help but crash in my bed.  Several phone calls woke me up, but they were appreciated for two reasons.  One, I love to talk to people and two, it was important that I get up and work for a little while on everything I had to get done.  
     That is going to be my first installment of a very chaotic couple of weeks.  I'll get caught up, I promise.

      It's been a while but I've heard this blog is a good way to keep up with me since I'm never home.  The past week has indeed been insanely busy.  Monday night I stayed up until 4 a.m. doing thank-you notes and creating a deposit slip to take everything to the bank.  Tuesday I woke up exhausted and went in to work.  It was pretty fun, it went quickly as usual and I had two great swim lessons, I helped this little girl learn to float and this little boy named Ben to go underwater for the first time.  It was so cute, his dad was taking pictures and everything.  So it went well.  After work I flew home and I really got so many errands done.  I went to the bank and then to the library to get books on Jane Addams for an essay to apply to this program at school.  I finally saw Zdero for like the first time all summer and we caught up a bit.  Then I went and got my watched fixed and got medication for my feet (I know, I know, it's sick).  I came home and I had planned to work on cleaning and reading, but I fell asleep (what a surprise, honestly).  When I woke up, Alex was there because we'd planned on meeting up at 8, he was just supposed to come over.  My dad threw a pillow at me, I was completely out on the floor of the greenhouse.  We watched a movie and called it a night so I could get up early to go shopping with Katie.  After shopping on Wednesday, I met up with Ivana to practice her talent for Junior Miss since I am accompanying her for her program.  Then Zdero, Katie, Alex and I went to see "Farenheit 9/11".  I gotta say, I was mightily dissappointed.  It seemed so childish.  We agreed it could have been two movies - one of serious fact reporting and another of Bush-bashing.  It wasn't nearly as good as Moore's "Bowling for Columbine".  This one seemed hastily thrown together and not as in depth as some of his other work and a lot of the segments didn't quite fit.  Nevertheless it was a decent movie and I did learn a lot of interesting perspectives.  After the movie Zdero and I got together to talk about recent college developments - I got my roomates! They live in Vermont and Maine.  I heard from the girl in Maine, Ashley, already and she seems great, I can't wait to meet her.  I'm so excited to start this whole new path in a different place.  It's just the coolest feeling.  We've emailed each other and it sounds like we'll get along fine.  As for Valerie, my other roomate, I have yet to hear from her so we'll see.  I hope it all works out.  Thursday I went in to work and was so, so tired.  I had Ben again for lessons though, so I had a good time. He's so great, he has these Spiderman goggles that are so funny, he always makes me laugh.  I'm teaching him to jump into the water on his own.  After swim I took a quuick shower, did some more errands and met my mom for dinner.  Then it was off to Junior Miss rehearsal, which got tough because all the former Junior Misses and I talked about State Week experiences and I was like, God I wish I wasn't with Ceil.  I would have had so, so much more fun.  It was so miserable and I wish I had another host mom.  Ah well.  But overall today was a great day, I was in a terrific mood after work.  Tomorrow I work again and then I am going to practice with Ivana some more and finally we're going to see Cats, the musical! Yay! I can't wait, I think it will be so fun.  I'd planned to clean tonight, but I am so tired.  It's off to bed I think.

      I don't think that I played up how great of a day Saturday really was for me.  When I blogged, I was tired and crabby.  But Saturday really was one of the nicest days I've had in a long time.  The parade was really, really fun, along the route were lots of people I knew and talked to.  And for once I didn't feel full of dirt or chlorine from work, it felt good to dress up a bit.  Spending time with my mom was a rare thing and it was nice to catch up.  Although the firework thing didn't work out, watching AJM and spending time with my family made it a nice night.  Then there was Sunday.  Work was very interesting since I worked both open and close.  The girls at either end rival each other alot, and they all yell at each other for slacking off.  The morning consisted of setting up Fourth of July games and decorations for this big party the club was having.  The afternoon was kinda fun, I got to take underwater pictures of the kids.  It was right when the sun came out that Eric sent me in the water to photograph, and I was like, wow this is a great job.  I am swimming, asking kids to smile underwater, and getting paid.  After that part though, the afternoon wasn't so great.  It was when we began to do hardcore cleaning up.  I understand that allowing food by the pool adds to sales, but there was popcorn absolutely everywhere on the deck.  It addition to cleaning that up, I did so much laundry.  My arms ache from lugging those big 50 gallon garbage cans down a huge flight of stairs full of wet towels and then dragging clean towels back up and folding, folding, folding.  I did do a little bit of actual lifeguarding though, I took my turn sitting up on the stands as well.  Towards the end of the night only a couple of families remained and they brought their own music to listen to on this huge sound system.  It was a nice end to the day, I was the only lifeguard on a chair for a while because there were so few people in the pool and it was fun, listening to music and watching the sun go down and seeing parents actually play in the water with their kids.  Closing took forever, mostly because this one girl who works there doesn't think she should have to do much at night, the morning people should just finish what doesn't get done (and of course they think the opposite) and so she spent time whining instead of helping.  I am just going to keep my mouth shut alot, I think.  It's not worth arguing, these girls are all so opiniated.  I like them, but I'm not going to risk getting on anyone's bad side.  After work I started going home and reached for my cell to find out the plans for the night, and I'd forgotten it at home.  I was so mad at myself.  I flew home and showered and got ready in 10 minutes! Wow.  I am quite impressed, actually.  I am going to analyze what I did and do it more often.  After my mad dash to get ready, we flew to the park to find Janelle and Cotey and everyone for fireworks.  We found them and the French even accidentally bumped into us, which was perfect and it was great to hang out.  Afterwards we went to Taco Bell with Cotey and Janelle, going through the drive-thru twice to use up two coupons.  Then we camped out in the parking lot and ate.  It was a great conversation we had and I had a great time.  It was a nice end to my day.  I came home and crashed.  I knew it was coming, one night to catch up all my sleep.  I woke up today at 2 p.m., so I've been up for a couple of hours.  Now it's off to do more catch up, but that involves thank-you notes from my graduation party.

      The last few days have been very frustrating for me.  I have so much to do and it's hard to come up with a time table to do it all and make everyone happy.  I woke up Friday morning to my dad, yelling at me to do some more thank you notes.  I realize they have to get done, but I'm trying to organize my priorities in order of what's most important to me to get done and that isn't at the exact top.  Close, but not quite.  I was especially mad at him because earlier he'd asked me to get the boat clean.  It was 8:30 a.m. at that point, and I was supposed to do 40 thank you notes, clean the boat which is way downtown, and get to work by 2?  It was impossible.  Although upset I tried to compromise by doing some thank yous and then working on the boat.  It was actually kinda fun, I went down with Eddie and really made everything look nice.  I got really excited, thinking about going out on the boat Saturday for fireworks.  When I got home from cleaning, I worked upstairs in my room, trying to pick up everything before Chrissy came home from camp and added to the chaos.  Then it was off to work at Van Beck's.  It went so fast, it was actually really busy for a Friday night and I also had an entire truck to unload on my own.  My boss parked it in back and left.  Everything was going fine until 7 p.m., when Mr. Van Beck showed up with hundreds of checks to stamp and total to take to the bank.  It got to be very frustrating because there was only an hour left and I suddenly had another huge project.  And of course, I messed up the totaling process a bunch of times and had to start over.  I wound up being at work half an hour later than expected.  Coming home, I was still in a high gear, in a mood ready to tackle bunches of projects.  So I began right away.  I finished putting together photo albums, cleaned out all my jewelery boxes, and straightened up the basement.  My plan was to get as much done in a late night frenzy as I could so I could relax on Saturday.  I stayed up until 4:30 in the morning, trying to get stuff done.  I also updated my calendar and tried to make myself a timeline of everything I need to do and schedule it around work.  I finally collapsed (on my floor, of course, because my bed is still harboring incomplete projects) and slept until 7 a.m.  Then it was time to get ready for the parade.  It was nice to take a long shower and primp a little bit.  It'd been a while since I made myself feel nice, it'd been a long week of dirt at the farm and chlorine at the pool.  I drove with my mom and Alex to the parade and went to find my car.  It was nice to talk to Lisa, my junior miss coordinator.  She is like an aunt to me, someone a little more distant than a mom but someone who I can really talk to and get reassurance from.  I am so, so glad she's my coordinator, no way could I have handled some of this stuff without her.  The parade was pretty fun, people were really sweet.  Since I had a sign with my name on the car, random people addressed me by name.  Some people I knew and talked to, like my first grade teacher.  Alex's dad came to take pictures and said it seemed like I had a great crowd response, they were all really nice to me.  I had a good time.  Then it was breakfast with my mom, more like brunch actually.  It was pretty good.  Afterwards I finally had an afternoon free!  First time in over a week.  I did go to Van Beck's though, but to buy fruit and use my discount.  Then Alex and I headed away from my house so I could relax minus people everywhere.  We found a park and brought books because I'm supposed to read one for school.  But we totally got drenched in the rain.  I was soaked.  We went home to change and bundle up to see fireworks with my family, but the rain kept us off the boat.  All the work cleaning it and no go.  I was upset.  But we watched America's Junior Miss Program and that was pretty fun, it was interesting to see how Sopen's week went.  But towards the end of the night I was - guess what?- falling asleep.  I woke up feeling terrible because I swore to myself I wouldn't fall asleep and I did, as usual.  I feel like such a jerk falling asleep on people that way, but I'm just so tired.  I still feel like I wrecked the end of the day, I wasted it by sleeping.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I feel so, so bad about it and it's becoming a habit.  Maybe I'm narcoleptic or something...grrrr.  Well tomorrow I work 8-8 and then hopefully it'll be a night out with everyone to watch fireworks.  It'll be tough for me to get home in time, but it's work a try.  I'm just so frustrated right now because it's the beginning of another week of stuff to do and I'm tired of feeling like I'm not making progress and in the meantime, sleeping through time with people I care about.  Sigh.  Well it's off to get some chocolate ice cream I think, one of those days.  I really wish I didn't work Sunday, that way I could stay up late, watch a movie and eat.  That sounds so perfect.  But I'm off to bed and I hope this week is better, but I still don't know quite what to do.

      I wish so much I had more time for this thing.  Here goes another couple days rolled into one.  So Tuesday was the first day of the lifeguarding job.  I love it.  It's a nice drive out there, really nice scenery and everything.  I learned how to take care of the pool and I even began giving swim lessons the first day.  It was so much fun.  This one little girl apparently would never go underwater for any of her other instructors and I got her to do it!  It was a pretty good feeling.  Mr. Van Ert is my boss, but insists I refer to him as "Erik", which is tough, calling him something more formal is habit.  The other guards who work there are....interesting.  Ben's sister is reallly sweet and helped me out alot the first day.  Sarah is also really nice, but I can tell that if you get on her bad side, it'd be tough to work there.  The other girls are the same way.  They are all very nice to me, but bash each other openly for any mistakes.  So I think as long as I don't screw anything up, we should get along fine.  It's good motivation to do a good job.  I was really sunburned after Tuesday.  I came home and immediately had to work on choreographing part of the opening routine for junior miss.  We had rehearsal that night and I got to meet five of the girls.  They are all really sweet, and really energetic.  I hope they have fun and that I contribute to making it a good time for them.  After rehearsal it was time for some ultimate frisbee in the park, but I was so sunburned and getting so bitten up and I suck so much that it wasn't much fun.  But it was great to see everyone.  The next morning I actually got to sleep a bit, but then I had to work at 2 p.m. but at Van Beck's.  It went pretty fast, but was so not busy it was dull.  Plus I was exhausted.  I felt so drained I felt sick everytime someone came in, because I wanted to just sit for a second because I was feeling nauseous.  I think it was lack of sleep plus all the sun the day before.  After work I rushed to the mall with Alex to buy a swim suit.  I needed a black one as part of my uniform for work.  I found one that I like alot and won't give me weird tan lines.  That's important because my cousin's wedding and junior miss involve strapless dresses.  I'm thinking I may have to do the unthimkable for me though - go tanning.  I want an even tan, so no matter what I wear next year I don't have to worry about messed up lines.  I hate that.  After the suit thing, I went home and I made myself dinner and intended to eat it and get some work done, but instead I crashed on my couch.  I was so tired it wasn't funny.  I woke up this morning around 5 a.m. and did my dishes from the night before and got ready for the lifeguarding job.  It was fun again.  We went an hour early so we could vaccuum the pool.  We did lots of cleaning today, which was fun for me because I'm a dork who loves to clean.  I also helped Mr. Van Ert ..err, Erik, with a swim lesson and I sat up on the stand and watched over the whole pool a lot.  Then it was time to head home. I fell asleep in the car, I felt kinda bad, I don't know Danielle that well but she's really nice and said she didn't mind.  Then I had a doctor's appointment and I got these warts I've had on my toe forever frozen off with liquid nitrogen.  I know it's so gross, but it was pretty sweet too, it's a weird feeling.  And I lost weight!  That was good news too.  After the doctor I went dress shopping for something to wear in the parade that would hide the swimsuit tan lines on my back. I found a dress I really like and shoes to match.  It should be fun, I can't wait for Saturday because it'll be my first day off in a week.  Sunday I work 8-8 for 12 hours straight...but that's another story.  Well, it's time to do thank you notes and whatnot, then tomorrow I'm going to clean the boat for my dad for Saturday.  He's in an upset mood and I hope he cheers up.  Well, goodnight.

      Things have been going pretty well lately.  Thursday was a really slow day of work because the kids all had their championship swim meet, so they were at another country club.  That night I came home and packed to go on our Lake Geneva  trip.  Friday I worked regular hours except Eric let me out half an hour early, which was perfect because he also paid us so I had time to run to the bank before taking a shower and meeting up with the group at Alex's house.  We left the house at around 5, and it took us until like 7 to get to our motel because Zdero didn't follow us on a certain exit and basically the two cars circled each other on the freeway until we met up again.  It was funny, but I drive so much during the week I'll admit I got frustrated.  But the road trip was fun, it was nice to talk and listen to music and know we all had the whole weekend ahead of us to enjoy.  We got to the motel and since their was 7 of us, we had our own seperate cottage type thing.  Janelle had made reservations for dinner at the Lake Lawn Lodge, so we dressed up a bit and went driving into Delevan.  Dinner was great and the atmosphere was beautiful.  There was a live piano player, who we wound up meeting and taking our picture with.  It was so funny, Janelle handed her camera to some random man to take the picture and it turns out he is a cinematographer!  After dinner we walked along Lake Delevan and headed back to the motel.  We were exhausted and fell asleep pretty quickly.  The next morning Janelle woke up really early and made us all these huge subs after taking Alex's car to buy lunch meat.  We ate at like 11 a.m. because the rest of us slept so late - no need for breakfast.  After that we began an adventure to find a nice beach to spend the day at.  The first one we went to was a little expensive, so we drove to a state park that supposedly had a beach.  It turned out to be like a pond.  It was pretty fun, but we were still on a mission.  We continued onward and discovered a gorgeous waterfront property and also the first 4-H club of Wisconsin and took pictures.  We finally turned around and headed to yet another beach Janelle suggested.  But when we got there, the attendant taking parking fees told us about a better beach to go to.  It took us forever to find - one of the roads he told us to follow ended in a cemetery - and involved stopping at a random person's home for directions.  The beach turned out to be on a mill pond formed off of the river connecting to Lake Delevan.  It was really nice tough, in the middle there were giant slides and bouys to jump off of and in the sand was a volleyball court for us to play on.  We spent a couple of hours there, got sunburned, and headed back to the motel.  We took showers and naps and then headed into town for dinner.  After dinner we shopped for a little bit, bought ice cream and headed back to the motel again.  Once we got there, we decided to go swimming in the resort's tiny pool.  After that came another round of showers and bedtime.  The next morning we again skipped breakfast in favor of an early lunch of hamburgers and hotdogs.  We then packed up and half of the group headed for home.  Mike, Janelle, Alex, and I went back into town one more time and shopped for an hour or so.  Then we went home too, stopping in Elkhorn to see Alex's dad's new office and the town.  
     It had been a great weekend, and when I got home things kept improving.  I had received my acceptance letter into the SPA Leadership Program, which excited me very much.  Then my dad made dinner and since my siblings are gone for the week at camp, it was a quiet night with Alex and my parents.  After dinner, Alex and I headed to Barnes and Noble to pick a book I have to read for the Leadership Program.  I love going to the bookstore with him because different things tend to catch our eyes and he points out random things I may not have noticed and vice-versa and then there's plenty to talk about.  We had fun browsing for books and I finally bought the one I needed.  We headed home and the weekend was complete.
     Monday was full of working and errands.  I woke up really early and was out of the door a little after 7. I was at the pool until 1 and then at Van Beck's from 2-8.  But the time really flew by and it was a pretty good day.  I got home and got a little frustrated sorting through things I need for school, but I got a couple of things accomplished.  I read for a bit and headed to bed.  Tuesday morning I got up for work and helped out at the pool 9-3.  I came home and did more college stuff and called to make a dress-altering appointment for my bridesmaid dress.  Then Alex came over and we read our seperate books - if he is there reading it keeps me focused on reading too, instead of being stressed about school.  Well it's off to bed, tomorrow will bring errands and tons of Junior Miss preparation!
