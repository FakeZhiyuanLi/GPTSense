      i had the most random day posible today i had multiple day dreams of how my life will be as i get older i dont know if there premenitions or just flights of fancy i dont realy care ne way cos in that dream like state i am truly happy no one nagging me just me wid a nice set of rents a nicer boss who dosnt avoid lookin at me or talkin to me oh and a girlfriend who acepts me for what i am and not wot people think i shud be id settle for the first 2 though cos itll be a cold day in hell before ne girl will go out wid me willingly and without ne form of pitty involved or cash oh well its not like i care im happy being da friend of unkonwn sexuality just cos i cant get a gf oh well theres a girl out there for me somewhere i just hope i find her before i find somthing dangerous
