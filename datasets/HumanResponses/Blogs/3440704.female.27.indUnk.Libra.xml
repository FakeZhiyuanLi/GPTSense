        We spent the weekend cleaning up the yard and house.   Unfortunately, there were no takers on the appliances and sofas that we had so they were disposed of.  The Greenhouse has been dismantled, the rusty clothes line torn out and the piles of trash disposed of.      We did discover some old cans of food urlLink (Seneca Foods)  in the basement (beets and pink salmon)that explode when thrown in the fire.      We had our first non-family house guests this weekend, and we would like to thank Phil & David for stopping by to check out the new abode.     Also on the yard clean up front, we were able to mow, thanks to my Grandfather letting us borrow his  urlLink Weed whacker .  Which I would like to add is an extremely powerful and highly recommended piece of yard maintenance equipment (not that I now shit about Weed Whackers). However, after Weed whacking the front lawn we were able to take a mower to it.      On an unfortunate note I did manage to take out the back drivers side fender of my car on my mail box.  Which has put a lovely scratch and crease in the fender from the tail light to the gas tank cap area.  Doesn't it seem like when you are spending large amounts of money on one thing something else comes up. Fortunately there is only a  urlLink $250.00 deductible .

      Okay, here is the story.  Brian and I (Katie for those who do not know me) bid on a home that was up for Auction (the prior owners did not pay their property tax.)  We ended up with this beauty for the low low price of $14,000.  It is 1500 square feet w/ four bedrooms and 1 bath (which really needs to be  completely  redone).  There are a lot of projects the first being  cleaning up the yard!!!!   I ask, how can anyone have lived like this?

       urlLink    The front view of 1785 Welcher Rd., can you see the potential?  Let me point out the positive, Straight Roof line (good), Only one broken window (pretty good), Wood siding is not rotted but needs paint (not so bad).  Anybody ready for some work?&nbsp; urlLink

      We, really have been busy with the repairs (actually mostly demolishing at this point).  I have to first thank my father (Bob Hause) for all the time he has put into working on our home.  It is really nice to have someone to teach us how to do things.    Since I last checked in (yeah I know it has been a while) we have been able to nearly complete (that means the floors are not done) 3 of the bedrooms.  We are still open to suggestions anyone may have to help spruce up the completed rooms.  {Thank you Cindy George for the great save on the "yellow room"} a jute rug sounds much nicer than a dark blue.  I think you are absolutely right when you say it will look like the Swedish flag puked.   We had a visitor this past week, Holly (Brown) Kassan stopped by for the grand tour of our Castle.  When she is home at the end of July we are putting her to work. (Holly, remember to pack clothes you want to throw away).   A Brief List of what we have done so far: *  Cleaned out all the garbage *  Tore out the walls in the bathroom and kitchen (the hallway ceiling fell in on my dad) *  Tore out all the plumbing *  Installed 3 new lights (bedrooms) *  Plastered, sanded, and painted 3 bedrooms *  Tore out "the deck" and "the greenhouse" *  Rebuilt the walls for the bathroom *  Started installation of a new bathtub *  Hammered about 10,000 nails into the floor in the hallway and the "yellow room"  after we ripped up the ugly ass flooring.  Please check back and email us if you have any decorating ideas!!!

       urlLink    Here is a better shot of Brian.  Since building cars is his area of expertice, I though It would be nice to include him in something more fitting than the side profile shot below.&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    The gutted kitchen.  We are replacing the ceiling joices (sp?).  The area in the corner of the Kitchen, near the red pole is where the pipes for the bathroom will come through.  The window in the kitchen is functional, but needs to be replaced with a vinly window. The tan color room to the right of the pick is our dining room&nbsp; urlLink
