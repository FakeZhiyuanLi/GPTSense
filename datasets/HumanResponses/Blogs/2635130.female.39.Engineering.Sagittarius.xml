      Due to structural problems in the deck, the pool is closed until further notice!  What am I going to do?    I'm so sad.

      I am probably the only swimmer who is slower when flipping than when not flipping.  I tried to flip at every turn.  I've improved in that I am no longer afraid to turn.  But for most of the turns today, I turned all the way and stood up.  I then realized that if I twist a bit, so that I come out of the turn on my side, I'm much more comfortable pushing off the wall than when I'm on my back.  Once I made that change, I was doing better.  It would help if I could get close enough to actually touch the wall on every turn, but I am making progress.  Duration: 30 minutes Distance: 1000 yards Workout: 200 free/warm up, 300 free, 400 kick (50 dolphin, 50 back, 100 free)x2, 100 free Weight: 212 pounds

      Well, if I'm going to lose weight, I have to diet.  I'm starting today.  On Monday, I'll start with Weight Watchers.  I found my WW info.  The meetings are on Tuesday, a swim day, so I probably won't be going to them.  And at night, if I go to a meeting I should go to  OA .  It's so hard to get out at night with the kids so little.  Our evenings are very rushed, and I want to spend time with my kids.  That's one of the reasons I had kids.

      Distance: 1100 meters Duration: 29 minutes plus 2 laps.  I forgot to start my timer. Workout:  200 free/warmup, (50 sprint/free, 50 recover/free)x2, 200 pull breathe 7,3,5,3, 300 kick 100 sizzor, 50 dolphin, 50 back, 100 sizzor, 200 free/cool down.  It's definitely getting easier.  I'm going to try to swim 300 w/o stopping next time.  I didn't flip.  I'm not comfortable doing that in the big shared lanes.  I really like swimming 50 m before turning better than 25 yards.   Weight: 212 pounds - not bad considering my father's 85 birthday party was last weekend and I spent Sunday eating, uh, I mean, visiting with my brother.

      The pool where I work is 50 meters by 25 yards.  On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, we swim 50 meters. On Tuesday and Thursday, we swim 25 yards, so they can have a water aerobics class in the shallow end.  Duration: 30 minutes Distance: I forget. Workout:  Swim:  200 free, 100 medley,  kick:  (50 free, 25 dolphin, 25 back)x2 plus 50 free, 50 free (front, side, back, side), 50 free,  Pull:  100 medley,  Swim:  100 medly, 100 medley (10, 8, 4), 50 free   At least, I think that's what I did.  Yuki helped me to learn to flip today, and I even managed to flip close enough to the edge to push off.  We'll see if I can do it while swimming laps.  Weight: 212.5 pounds :(

      Duration: 30 minutes Distance: 1000 meters  Workout: 200 warmup/freestyle, 200 free, 200 pull, 300 kick, 100 cooldown/free  I'm getting in better shape.  I think I will try swimming 300 free w/o stopping next time.  My breathing really needs work.  Whe pulling, I tried to stoke 9 for the first 50, 7 for the 2nd, 5 for the 3rd, and 3 for the last.  I was able to do the occasional long holding of breathe, but mostly I had to breathe every 3rd stroke, my normal rate.   Weight: 212 pounds :(

      Distance:  800 meters Duration: 25 minutes  Today, I was able to swim freestyle for 200 meters without stopping.  I've really improved since last fall when I could barely swim 50 meters without feeling like I was going to die.

      Okay, so I created a neopet, Stevie1220, the flotsam. Stevie really liked the chocolate coated mint bar, but she is bloated. And now, we've spent most of our points making a shop.  I tried to read Stevie a book, the Magic Paw, but she said she likes books with pictures.
