						   On most days, I try to turn away from the windows that open to thoughts of you. Yet I am still stung with the odd moment of really wondering how you are…. I want to pick up the phone to tell you something only you would find funny, or I wonder something stupid like how your dogs are, or how you remodeled your kitchen. I don’t imagine that you wonder the same sort of thing about me. I was just a vehicle to carry you from one place in your life to the next.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that you’ve reached your destination, you’d no more wonder about me than you’d wonder about the fate of your cab driver.

						   you wrote this to me:  &nbsp; I miss you your hands on me your breath and its rhythm surrounding me the warmth of you curled up around my side the way your lips feel against the skin of my neck the fine curls of your hair laced through my fingers the way your eyes glow when I tell you I love you

						   I. If I am smooth It is the smoothness of a river rock Or a pocket-worn coin I wasn’t made that way: I came into this world all hard angles, bounce and static- The lone receiver of&nbsp; a longing filled&nbsp;broadcast That could only be my ancestors, Desperate to defend the choices they once made.  II. In 19aught what? my Grand Uncle Walter was the first man to ride a bicycle down Pike’s Peak -before it was paved or graded-why he did it I do not know The song writer thinks that it was to show that When our days are done no stone will be rough - no path unpaved but the householder knows: his brain was starved in the high altitude.  III. Your hands are not smooth They are calloused from the Grasping and hefting and testing of Your own river’s bed of rocks Still, the very work that roughens those hands Washes them so clean.

						   Today I witnessed one of the most moving and extraordinary sights in my life. I had the true privilege of witnessing the most beautiful wedding ever.   I watched the woman who had been my first love exchange vows with her partner of several years in front of their family and friends. In itself it was a lovely ceremony and a lovely event, but even more so, it was a lesson in the transforming and strengthening power of love.  Fifteen years ago, when we fell in love, a wedding between two women was completely unthinkable to most of the world, us included. I was sure I was a lesbian, but she had simply fallen for me, the idea of being a lesbian herself simply was too difficult to digest- forget the wedding, we had more elemental things to wrangle with. We ended our adolescence struggling with these issues together, not on a political level but on an extremely personal one: "I love you. I want to marry you." And "I’m sorry I just can’t do that." This was the constricted space in which we, and our love, grew to adulthood, the space in which we loved each other, hurt each other and eventually grew apart and grew into the terms of the world around us. Certainly, we would have grown apart anyway, as is largely proper for first loves, but that growing apart would have been more about our actual development as people, rather than the development of our respective lesbian identities.  The years passed, we kept in touch on and off as life allowed. Lovers came and went- I wanted to marry each and every one of mine, while she wouldn’t have considered that under any circumstance that I know of. I never got my wedding, but I knew that things had changed for her when, about six or seven years ago (God help me I can’t remember,) instead of just waiting for the next woman to park themselves in her life, she got the nerve up to actually  go after  a lovely woman that we knew through mutual friends.   As their love grew more steady and committed, I watched my friend relax and expand- she somehow became  more herself - bolder and stronger- strong enough to have no doubt that she wanted the world to know how she felt about her partner. And today, after showing the world just how strong she was by vowing her love, I watched my friend lean forward, rest her forehead on her love’s shoulder and sigh deeply, as if this love was the home she had been waiting to come to all these years.   And, my sisters and brothers, that experience of love and growth is why God put us on this earth.

						    I guess I think it's funny that you still check out my website.  I mean why?  What do you care?  And why does bitchyblondy74 care?  You got what you wanted.  I'm done ranting and I've left you alone after that big blast the other week cleaned all the poison out of my system, I'm at peace, finally.
