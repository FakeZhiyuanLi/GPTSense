      Well me and Ryan are all better now so that's good news. Anyway, last night was a fun time... Ryan and I got into an arguement, my mom thought I was high, my friend Maki came over and than it rained. We were in it. Yay... ha! It took atleast 5 min and we were drenched. Mhm, my mom just got off the phone with my Doctor's office. They're going to drug test me and my little brother. So now I can prove to my mom that I havent done anything. So now what BIATCH! I can't believe my mom thinks I'm a pothead, hah. It's prolly only because of me dating Ryan... Eh! So now today Maki and I are going to meet our friend Kramer and go eat pizza, around 12... LOL, Pizza is the best man! Hmmmm, we're just sitting her listening to music. Fun!! We're going goodbye...

      Well today was fucked up. I broke up with my boyfriend and you want to know why..!!?? Because I actually let someone control me.. My ex-bf mike told me if I didnt break up with Ryan. He wouldnt come and see me and he wouldnt talk to me. Why do people like to manipulate me????? I'm a fucking loser. I should be shot because of what I let happen, geez. I just can't even say how disapointed I am in myself. I'd never let something like this happen but I did today. I've just proven to everyone of my friends that have said I've changed that they're right, eh.

      Well.. I just woke up about 45 min ago and I wish I could of slept more... I had a long day yesterday, considering I didn't go to school... So I cleaned my apt. and than I just hung out here till people got home. My boyfriend called me as soon as he got home, hah. That's cool.. Yeah, I like him a lot. I just hope he doesn't screw me over. I went out like around 7:00 last night and came home around 10:00... I was with Ryan that whole time, but he didn't leave till about 12:00 last night... It was fun, we talked about me and my simple life and his drugs. He's a little out there in the drug world.. Rolling=E, Trippin=Shrooms and Smacked=Weed or Candyflipping=E&Shrooms... Eh!! But, he's slowing down on everything.. So that makes me happy. I still feel weird dating him tho.. I just feel like I should be dating Mike.. But we know that won't happen. He's back in Maryland.. And I am not, hah.  Mhm, let me see........ Maybe I should start doing something with my life. Other than sleeping, eatting and sitting on the computer. I mean I go outside but I don't do anything out there either. I just sit around with Ryan and his friends while they talk drugs. Hah...  I miss my friends back in Maryland.. I really miss Jenny and Kasey. Dude but I feel so alone without my D-unit. Ahaha, my Deter. That's my whore there, haha. Wow we had the best times in gym. You would of had to be there to see why. Geez, Mrs. Shoenadle hated me. Me and Deter made it impossible for her, lol. Memories like that I love to look back on and talk about. D-unit and C-unit, The Dyanamic Dou lives on. Jenny I've known sense I was 8 so I'm deffinitely missing her in my life... We've been thru alot, Turtle Food to make a point.. Hah!!! Than there would be Cookie Monster... Kasey I mean... I love her!!!! Matt and Tj were my good friends too. They made my days better when I was sad, hah. Thanks! Now I'm here..... Alone and without all of them.... Geez, I hope I can make it without them..

      Corbin came into my kneck of the woods today! I was so excited cause I've liked him sense I moved here and than he just ups and moves himself. Heh, what luck!? We hung out today and everyone was over. Hassan, Danny, Collin, Corbin, Makensie and Kyle. It was fun... Danny and Makensie I know had fun, lol. Well me and Corbin did end up making out. Which was my one dream, lol..And it happens but I stopped after a couple of minutes. I felt weird doing it. Like I thought it was going to be the feeling I get when I like the person, but there was so much on my mind I couldnt even think positive about Corbin and I. I miss Ryan and I know I shouldnt.. And there would be Mike. The one kid  I loved and still love. I left back in Maryland. I just couldnt do it because even tho he ended up making out with this one chic and liking my best friend Kasey..I just couldnt do it!! Mike and I should be together but we're not and that drives me insane... I just cant deal with guys right now, I'm so afraid of actuyally letting things happen with my and Corbin because I dont want it to end up like a Cameron thing. I want to not do the things I do cause of Mike... I just need not worry about guys tho... But in the end Im happy and sad..
