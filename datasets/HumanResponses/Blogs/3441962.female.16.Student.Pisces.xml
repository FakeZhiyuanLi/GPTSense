						   Finally I got some more yarn. Yes, I am one of those monstrous creatures about which you may have heard in LYS whispers. I do not have a stash. This miserable condition comes from no decision of my own-- it is simply a product of my inability to drive, and the resultant dependence upon my mother for transportation. I rarely get to a store where I can buy yarn, and as soon as I get it, I use up every bit.  Today I went to Jo-Ann's and bought 5 skeins-- 4 of red Wool-Ease, and one of some very cheap pure orange acrylic. Yes, I knit with acrylic. It really isn't that bad. Anyway, I can't afford much better. It takes me a month to save up enough money to buy nice yarn for a single garment-- yarn that I will use up in a few days. I am using the red yarn to knit  urlLink Shimmer , a shrug from the Winter 2003 issue of  urlLink knitty . I plan to use the orange, along with one of the two skeins in my non-stash, to make the  urlLink Sound System Snugglers  from the same issue. I also bought elastic to finish up my  urlLink Cleo  top (Summer 2003 knitty), some ugly stitch markers, a 29" #7 aluminum circular, and some Lion Brand plastic dpns (#8). I really like the Lion Brand needles. I already have one pair, and they are lightweight, smooth but not as slippery as aluminum (which is important for dpn), and have bright, almost luminescent colors.  I cast on for the first sleeve of Shimmer, and though I knitted for more than two hours, I only got about 4 inches done. That was partly because I had some issues with casting on on dpns. It's only the second time I've used them, and though it isn't extremely difficult, it's a little tricksy. I have a feeling I will be working on the sleeves for awhile, though the back should be easy. Oh, well. At least dpns are VERY impressive for KIPing.  P.S. I will start posting pictures once I figure out how. Ditto for making sidebars, etc. SOMEWHERE on the Web there must be a site that teaches one how to do that...

						      Well, here I am with a new blog. I figured that most other knitters seem to have them these days, and I might as well jump on the bandwagon... also, my "normal" (i.e. non-knitting) friends were getting a bit annoyed by my constant knitting talk in my regular Blog. Now I can talk about knitting to my heart's content, and NO ONE CAN STOP ME!! Mwahahahah!    I will be trying to figure out how to change things... I know next to nothing about HTML. I don't even know how to insert a picture into a post. I hope to have that figured out soon...    Oh, well, done with this entry. I will try to have more intresting things to talk about next time.

						   I have finished one and a half sleeves of Shimmer... I started the back today, because I was tired of knitting with dpns. The other night I dreamed that I had finished it, and was dancing around in it while my sister took pictures for me to post here of the finished object. Maybe it was a sign that I will figure out how to put pictures on here? Anyway, it was a pretty good dream. Until a guy friend of mine, and his girlfriend, came over to my house and his girlfriend and I walked around naked and he got confused (that last sentence was a dream, if you happened to miss that part).
