      heya ppl.  today i made spag bowl, my fave dinner 4 me charley and law. richard is round btw.   my mums bosses (she works for social services in cambridgeshire) were supposed to send her on a training course so she could work up to be a social worker (shes only a lookafter children care worker atm), but now they say they have already found someone to do the job they need.   the only reason i think my mum took the job for was because she would work up to bein a social worker and working with children and stuff and because her salary had gone up from her previous job at £12,000 a year to £15,000 a year wen she got her certificate.   so, me charley nd law r eatin dinner and my mum and richard are washin up over at the sink. my sister eats like a pig she:   inhales like a pig eats with her mouth open talks with her mouthfull sits like a slut.    my sisters friend becca knocked on the front door. my mum went and answered it and said 'sorry shes eating her dinner at the moment, she'll b out wen shes dun the washing up' and my sister just totally flipped over it! she started mouthing off, and sayin 'dont tell people that i have to wash up! what about if i want to keep that personal information!' and arrrgghh it was just sooo stupid and annoying!  and now my mums swearin off about her bosses, something she only does when shes really upset. now shes just said she might as well quit! one of the reasons we moved was because my mum wanted a new job!  why did i have to move to farm land? i just feel that i shouldnt have moved here.  today i also got stamped with a green frog by my dog of an ex girlfriend rachel (SKANK ALERT) and my new mp3 player headfones got broken by the pysco-maniac that is steven. he has no mates. he just likes hurting people because he thinks it makes himself hard. it really makes him pathetic.  also, i luv my mum bcoz she has the ability to turn things round, u no? like, tomorrow ive got to go 2 an attendance meeting, about my 89.3% attendance rate when the average is 90%, so she wrote me a letter complaining and i feel that everything will go alrite...  its wierd.   IMPORTANT NEWS: my mums friends son is going to italy to play for englands under 16 rugby!  i've got loadsa more stuff 2 write but im all mixed up and i need to like, sort them out first...  btw... im thinking of telling someone at my new school about being gay.. do u think i shud? make a comment or email me!  james xx

      heya ppl!  2day.......... started my paper round again.. 28 houses, monday to friday, £9. it sucks. i have to get up at 6:20 in the morning, and finish before half seven. today i made a mistake! ohh no someone help me!  lol i put the paper through the wrong door because i misread my roundsheet. so i had to come home, get some money and buy a new paper to go through the door i didnt do  (becuase the house i put the paper through are on holiday). came home, sweatin, wet, and with a headache :-( so i had a shower and told my mum i felt sick, and she believed me! so now i got nuthin 2 do 4 a whole day! lol  in my last post i said i was going to tell you about my dad at the weekend, but since i got the day off i think im going to do it now.  wen i woz bout..... 11 probably, my dad was having an affair with this girl where he worked, and i heard him tel my mum before we (my 8 yo brother law and my 11 yo sister charley) got told. They were up in their room, and i was in the downstairs hall on the computer. I heard my mum shout something like 'no andy, u cant do this 2 me and the kids! you cant leave!', and then that night my dad bought us pizza and we watched casulty, and then after that he told us. Everyone else was crying except me.  Then, we had already paid for the flights to my dads aunts villa on the costa del sol , so we were going on holiday. by this time, my dad had broken up with the first girl he was having an affair with, and was now going out with his 2 present girlfriend lisa (i 'll get to her in a min).   then, we had had a nice day at the pool, and we went to the beach and we had had dinner out and me and my brother were in our bedroom. My sister was asleep in my mums bed, me and law had our own room to share, and my dad was sleeping on the sofa. So it was about half 10 at night, and my dad had finished on the phone with lisa. he came in and started telling my mum about how she was being beaten up and stuff. then my mum started crying and i didnt hear what she said. then i heard my dad shout 'stop it stupid cow' and i heard him slap my mum. i'll never forgive him for that.  now, lisa is a bitch. shes 34, which is 5 years younger than my dad, has 2 kids, natalie and louie who are 14 and 10, they are sooo spoilt u wud not believe. and my dad takes it.  they bought a £400,000 BUNGALOW in borehamwood, hertfordshire, which has got 3 rooms, a crappy bathroom and a kitchen, hoping to build it up into a 5 bedroom house. yeh rite.  then they bought a dog, molly, which is stupid because they cant even look after their own house let alone a dog. I mean, natalie wont let my dad get anything proper (like a collar) because it 'isnt fashionable and i wudnt take the dog out' (honestly shes a cow).   i cant be bothered to write any more at the moment.. i mite go speak 2 connexions on da net or sumfin.  tlk l8r  james xx
