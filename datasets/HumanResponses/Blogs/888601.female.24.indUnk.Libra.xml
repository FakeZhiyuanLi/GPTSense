      Like all religions there is a beginning. So here it is. On the first day the rocker gods said let there be a stage like no other. So they got together and decided upon a sphere with gravity, and they rested. The second day the rocker gods said let there be a distant object that can show the almighty band. So they again made a sphere that was distant and large and bright object. On the third day the rocker gods said let there be a material that can created the greatest sound in the world, so they made several kinds of woods. On the forth day the rocker gods said let there be a material that can make the sound for our new guitars, so they created metal in which became stings. On the fifth day the rocker gods said let there be a substance that could make me feel awesome, in the process of making this drink they got drunk and never fixed the soon apparent "Hang-Over".On the sixth day they slept as long as they could for the light was to painful to face hung-over. On the seventh day they said Let there be the cosmos and let there be the Roady, so as you can guess they created the cosmos and humans.

      This is the first chapter of man. One of the rocker gods, the same one that created the awesome drink, was in charge of creating the first man. He took up some clay and began to sculpted the great creation, when finished with creating this awesome sculpture he decided he was done for the day so he got drunk and left his creation sitting on a pedestal. The next day he awoke with a huge hang-over and accidentally set man on a pedestal out side in the sunlight. When he woke the next day he attempted to blow the breath of life into man. Unfortunately man was unable to move in anyway. The rocker gods were not  satisfied. So the rocker synonymous with hangovers attempted to make a new man, this time after being drunk. He made the ears too big, fur all over the body, and his arms where too long. The next day with a giant hangover he attempted to give the breath of life again, this time he didn't give enough breath. Not having enough breath, the monkey was created. The rocker gods though amused immediately took the drunk moron off the project and put another rocker god on the creation of man. This god created man out of mud and immediately gave man the breath of life. Though ignorant Mammoth was created. The rocker god then decided to create another so he pulled the rib of Mammoth out and created a female of this new species. This pleased the rocker gods so much that they created a garden, the gods then wormed Mammoth and Beth that they could live there and do anything they want. Under one condition, they must not touch the apple tree of heaven.

      Mammoth and Beth enjoyed their new home, they always had plenty to eat and never felt pain. They constantly praised the rocker gods, thanking them for their contributions. This pleased the rocker gods  immensely. One day while walking in the woods Mammoth came across the apple tree of heaven and at the foot of the tree was a snake. Mammoth panicked and immediately smashed the snake with his army boot(they had army boots back then). The snake slithered away and vanished into the woods. Then a tall, dark-haired, man with skull shirt walked from where the snake had disappeared. The man spoke to Mammoth "Hey man. Want an apple."   Then Mammoth replied, "No way man, The Rocker Gods warned me and Beth not to touch the apple tree of Heaven."  The mysterious man Spoke again, "Of course they would say that they don't want you to be as intelligent as they are. They keep the good Fruit for selvesselfs."  Mammoth thought about it a bit and said ignorantly, "Your right I should be as smart as the monkey and as smashed as the gods." And so he grabbed an apple and brought it back to Beth. Mammoth showed Beth the apples and told her the entire conversation he had with this man. Beth, however didn't understand what Mammoth had told her because she was smashed from the party she had returned from with the rocker gods. So they ate the apples and gained intelligence. The rocker gods called upon Mammoth and Beth as a practical joke. Mammoth was in the middle of gulping down the large apple. The rocker gods were very disappointed in Mammoth and Beth so they through them out. Mammoth and Beth Had seven kids. Each kid created something: The first created science, the second created math, the third created writing, the forth created painting the fifth created politics, the sixth created a bar, and the seventh created the greatest of all the family. The seventh created a band.

       September 30, 2002   Heehee, JD Byrider called here AGAIN wanting to talk to Kieth.  He should be calling soon wanting money and I'm sure my Mom'll give it to him because he can't not have a car.  What the hell they do with their money I have no idea, but it becomes my business when my Mom starts hitting me up for cash because she's giving all of her money to Kieth.     On to other things...I came home from work today and flopped on the couch around 8:30.  I woke up at 9:30; dammit I missed Smits tonight!  I always sleep through Smits.  Grrrrrrrrrr...   I have done absolutely nothing worthy of writing about; quite the exciting day, yes?

       September 30, 2002   OK, so today doesn't start off the best.  I woke up at 9:30A, and am supposed to be at work by 9A.  Thank you Wolfie for keeping me up until 5:30AM!  I appreciate it so much!     This place needs to pay me more or I'm going to have to find another job.  I love this job, but it's just not cutting it in the money department.  Maybe if my Mom would stop "loaning" Kieth money ($2000 in the last couple months) I wouldn't have to help her pay for stuff.  Wait, I work more hours a week than she does, but make half as much.  Throw in me cleaning the apartment and that sounds about fair, doesn't it?  I don't think so.  Perhaps I'll get a different job and move out; wouldn't that be nice?   I'm now so pissed off I can't even type.  Grrrrrrrrrrr.

       September 29, 2002   I know, I'm late getting going on this today.  It's Sunday, cut me some slack!  I just got an IM from some guy wanting my A/S/L.  OK, first of all my profile clearly states to leave me alone.  Secondly, all of that "important info" is in my profile.  Jesus, people are becoming more and more stupid everyday.  Pretty soon I'll have to block all IM's just to get anything done on the Net.  I do enjoy telling them off though, it keeps me sharp in an otherwise dull world!   I just won a cute DM thing on eBay.  It's a mishmash of "school supplies" such as pens, pencils and eraser...It'll look cute on my desk at work.  My Targa is up to over $15,000.  Here's the  urlLink link  in case you want to see what I'm babbling about...This beauty is lurking in front of my office just begging me to drive him.     I really should do laundry but I don't want to!  Tuesday seems like a good laundry day to me, what's everyone else's opinion?   My cat is a retard, but I love him anyway.   Bleh.  Today has been a decent day, but I still kinda feel bleh-ish.  Once again, bleh.

       September 28, 2002   Alas, I didn't win the face Docs on eBay.  That's OK though, there's another pair up in 5 days that I'm going to bid on as well.     I stopped at the Record Exchange tonight and picked up some good deals.  I got John Carpenter's Vampires, Dirty Harry, Van Halen's 1984, Journey's Evolution and 3 Doors Down's debut CD for $10!  I rock!  The videos are in VHS format but that's OK!   OK, it's on to Rally's because you gotta eat!  LOL

Steph did send me the link to a cool pair of Docs on eBay; thanks Steph!  I'll let everyone know if I win!    Gabe's had some cute red Docs last night, but they looked kind of tore up.  They were only $30 but I don't want tore up Docs!     Playlist Savatage LA Guns "Turn It Around" Dream Theater Type O Negative Lords of Acid Clutch "Spacegrass"

       September 27, 2002    Wheeeeeeee!  I went shopping today and didn't really buy myself anything!  I got all of the jeans for my eBay bidders and that's about it.  I didn't score any cute Docs, but I did buy some Burt's Bees stuff, and a 6 dollar bottle of water!  Woohoo!  Actually I was using a gift certificate I got for my birthday so it was OK.    I did buy myself a new brush.  It wasn't a treat; I think I left my brush in Wolfie's car.  Give it back, punk!   Nothing else is going on.  It was a pretty smooth day; a relief from the craziness I've been putting up with lately!  I hit Rally's and got the 2 honey grilled chicken samiches for $3, plus a large fry.  I have food left over for lunch tomorrow as I plan on sleeping in until at least noon tomorrow!   My horoscope said I was supposed to have a "10" day today, and I guess it's been pretty close.   OK, I think I'm done rambling!

        I go cruising into work today, and what's lurking in front of my office?  A 911 Targa!  In silver!  Maybe it's my belated birthday present.  OK, maybe I'm on drugs!  I didn't get a chance to talk with Bob, he was on the phone as usual, but I'll give him the third degree tomorrow.    The new haunted house on Market opens today.  Too bad it's raining and yucky or I'd go.  Wait, I have no one to go with, damn!  That's one thing I will never do; go to a haunted house by myself.  Half of the fun is scaring each other!  I believe the haunted schoolhouse and laboratory opens this weekend as well.  Anyone want to go with me?   I think I'll take a nap.

       Woohoo, two more people just emailed me about the Marc Jacobs jeans I have online!  Woohoo again!  Hopefully they'll buy a pair as that would really help me out financially.  I always overspend, but this time it wasn't my fault!  I calculated my pay wrong and wound up being 16 hours short!  Math is not my friend.   I think I'll go into work today for an hour or so.  I have to figure out this trunk situation for the bidder, and I like the work computer better anyway!  That reminds me, I saw an ad in yesterday's paper for a really cool sounding job.  I'm going to call about it!   Later!

       I just got an email from the nicest guy!  He's a bidder from work and I accidentally emailed him from my personal eBay account. Anyway, I shipped a metal trunk to him at the end of August and he didn't realize it had shipped.  It's been sitting at the Greyhound terminal in San Diego since the 3rd of September and Greyhound just decided to notify me on the 20th of this month.  So now they're threatening to ship it to the salvage yard in Texas if this poor guy doesn't run out there immediately and pick it up.  Goodness, you finally find a good bidder then this happens!  Don't get me wrong; I've run into a lot of nice people (Steph!) on eBay, but when you get a bad one they're really bad!  Ugh, thanks to all of the nice bidders, and sellers, on eBay!

       The white to blue sandals are awesome!  I emailed the rose boot seller today; they sent a form email stating that payment was received and that the boots will be shipped within 48 hours.  So that means for my instant payment, I will receive the boots 7-9 afterwards?  That's supposed to be good turnaround?  I am soooooo tired of eBay; that's why I'm not bidding on anything else.   Apparently the images I inserted today at work are only viewable on my work computer?  I deleted them from my blog for now; at least until I upgrade to Blogger Pro and obtain simple image insertion!  Maybe if Wolfie would help me figure out HTML I wouldn't have to wait! (hint hint)   Just in case this matters, add 3 hours to the entry times on this page.  I keep getting an error whenever I try to update my time settings; it's set for Pacific time and I'm Eastern.   I think I'll go to bed....Later

      September 25, 2002   Ugh, I am so tired of eBay.  I got to work this morning a little before 9A.  Tom and I went to  McDonald's for breakfast and then to UPS to ship some eBay stuff for work, and to ship some eBay packages for my personal sales.  I get back to the office and there's a couple emails from this guy saying he didn't receive his items.  Then he emailed me a second time today saying he did, but one item was missing.  Jesus, make up your mind!  So I investigate further and realize that this guy has been nothing but a pain in the ass from the end of the auction.  I sent his other item via UPS 2nd Day and I emailed him a notification, but I'm sure he'll continue saying he never received any email from me.  Awfully funny there's 4 emails to him in my outbox; but I guess I'm still wrong!   I crawled out of bed this morning at 7:50A and knew today was going to be a pissy day; I haven't been disappointed.   I did receive my white to blue color change Docs sandals, though.  I know this because I checked the FedEx tracking number and was pleasantly surprised to see they were delivered this morning; a day early!  On the flipside, my rose Docs haven't shipped yet as the seller hasn't even created my label.  Jesus, someone's going to get smacked.  Then I email these people and no one ever replies.  At least when I brain fart and forget to ship something I always reply to every inquiry.     I plan on leaving at 4:45P and going directly home to bed.  Mom is working so I'll sack out on the couch, stick Fluffy in the laundry bag and snooze the afternoon away.  I did laundry yesterday so I don't have to worry about having clothes to wear, and I also cleaned the apartment yesterday as well.  I even hung up the new shower curtain; yes I was that bored.

       OK, I was just called an addict in reference to Doc Martens.  Thank you Mattycakes, yes I am!   Yet another slow seller.  I paid for a DM jacket about a week ago and the seller just posted feedback today.  I'm assuming the reason I haven't received it is because it hasn't shipped.  Sheesh, is it just me?  No, I know one more person who has this problem; wink wink Steph.  Steph is my fellow DM addicted friend.  She's CalypsoFlamingo on eBay.  She rocks!   Bleh!

       Whew, at least there are still honest nice people in the world.  I just sold $81 worth of stuff on eBay today, and all of the buyers are awesome!    Contacted immediately and paid immediately.  That is what keeps me on eBay.  I also sold a pair of those MJ jeans; the girl is so nice too!  I wish she bought them via eBay so I could leave her nice feedback.  I'm a very nice person unless you try to screw me over; then I'm a total bitch.  Too bad.   I paid for my rose fabric Docs; lets see how long it takes them to arrive.  They were my birthday present to myself; I want them now!    I did three loads of laundry; actually it was one big load crammed into the biggest washer at the laundromat.  I was only there about an hour and home in plenty of time for my Smits fix.    Off to hang up my clothes and package the eBay sales.

      September 24, 2002   Bummed around until 10:30 this morning.  Then I had to get up and take the biddy to the cardiologist for a day full of tests.  I missed my spine scan and endocrinologist appointments; I'm never going to feel better if I don't stop pissing around!    Per usual, I didn't get anything in the mail today.  I did sell a pair of DM Chukka boots, though; that rocks.  I had an inquiry about the Marc Jacobs jeans I have on eBay; hopefully I'll sell another pair of those too.  I don't think $40 is too bad for a brand new pair of $140 jeans.   The landlords are still driving me crazy with their damn kids and the husband's temper tantrums.  It'd be nice if I could get a full night sleep.  Alas that's not going to happen until we move or a mysterious accident takes out the bottom half of the house.  I have a special place in hell reserved just for me...   Yet again, people piss me off.  Nothing new there...   I did receive a really cool DM poster yesterday; 3 weeks after I paid for it.  Luckily it's cool and I only paid $13 for it.  The 18 eye snakeskin Docs auction I was planning on winning was ended early.  Why list something if you're not sure you want to sell it?   I did win a cool pair of rose pattern boots for $25, so that kinda makes up for it.  The seller also agreed to ship via my UPS account so that saves me about $6 in shipping!

Of course not!   I will spend most of tomorrow changing my lawnbunny webpage images.  Check it out later in the afternoon, it'll be cute!   Jackass the Movie comes out tomorrow!  I must see it!  Woohoo!   That's all; nothing exciting happened today.  I cleaned the apartment and chased Fluffy with his brush.  Fun times, let me tell ya!   Byeeeeeeeeeee!

       Wednesday October 23, 2002   Yeah, I know.  No update for almost a week.  Cut me some slack, I've been in bed since Friday.  Trying to type while puking ones' guts out is not an easy thing to do.  But, I'm OK now so I'll continue updating daily.   Nothing is really going on.  I'm going to the Lords of Acid concert the first week of November, and I plan on seeing Jackass the Movie on Friday.  I've won a bunch of crap on eBay, and the items should start pouring in this weekend.  LOL     I'm going to work on my LawnBunny page.  Byeeeeeeeeeee!

       Tuesday October 15, 2002   I had a ton of things to do today and, amazingly, I completed everything!  I had three Dr. appointments today, but no jabbing like yesterday!  I was at the girl doctor for 2 hours today; wasn't that fun?  Everything was pretty unevenful, just a lot of sitting around.   I received five items today, including the black and red 3 eye steel toes.  They are ultra-cute and will quickly become my favorite pair of Docs!  I've been trying to add them to my webpage, but AOL is being evil as usual.   Other than that, nothing exciting happened today.     Back to work tomorrow, horray!

       October 14, 2002   Yeah, I know I'm slacking.  I just haven't felt like sitting down and writing, so now I have to sit here and write a ton!    Lets see, I've been off work since Friday.  I went shopping this weekend and picked up a cool 2003 calendar, and another CD holder for my car.  I need to buy some large CD towers for my room; the three I have are full.  I try to make it to CD Warehouse every other week to buy some tunes, but I've been slacking lately with my quest for Docs.  I'll go this weekend for sure!    I finally did laundry yesterday; I used 2 large washers and 4 smaller washers.  It took me $18 to do laundry; I hate not having a washer/dryer in the apartment!  I've decided that I will do laundry every Sunday whether I want to or not!  I could have made it another 2 weeks or so, but imagine the clothes I would have had to do!    An interesting thing did happen on Thursday evening.  I was puttering around on the Net when I received an email from an eBay user.  This woman asked if I would end my eBay auction early as she would be on vacation and unable to bid.  I thought she was referring to my DKNY Boot auction as she didn't include any auction number or description.  She was offering $20 plus shipping.  Seeing how I had the DKNY boots up for $10 Buy It Now, this was a good thing!  I thought she was a new bidder who couldn't use Buy It Now (new eBay rule, I guess).  So I happily emailed her back and told her sure I'd end the auction for $20 plus $5 UPS shipping.  She emailed me in return and requested a PayPal invoice.  I sent her the invoice with "DKNY Boots-eBay" in the email subject.  She paid the invoice, I emailed her a confirmation and then got offline to package some items and go to bed.  The next morning I got up early for work, and I gave the boots to the UPS man who was dropping off my black and white 20 eyes.  I then get to work, screw around for about a half hour and decide to check my mail.  There are at least THIRTEEN EMAILS from this woman.  It turns out she clicked on my ID when she really wanted to click on the seller's ID of the silver hologram Docs I was bidding on.  She claims she reported me to eBay, PayPal, Visa and MSN (what the hell are they giong to do?).  I have yet to hear from any of those people, but that's irrelevant.  This woman claims I stole her money, etc etc.  She is completely unhinged and needs a good smacking.  She was trying to bully me, in broken English nonetheless, but suddenly stopped emailing me when I made it perfectly clear that this was HER fault.  She should have received the DKNY boots today; strangely I heard nothing from her.  I am beginning to really hate new eBay bidders.  Learn the rules!!!    I went to the arthritis doctor today and of course I was jabbed.  So, feeling sorry for myself, I bought a pair of Docs.  They are salmon colored slides, UK7 but very cute.  I also stopped by Mr. Hydes and they let me see the Spring 2003 catalog.  There are some VERY cute styles, and the prices are ultra-low ($60 for the sandals!).  The kind folks there are finding out the exact dimensions for a pair I must have, then they'll place the order now so I will be one of the first people to have them!  Woohoo!   I have CT Scans on my adrenals tomorrow, along with X-Rays of my spine, knees and joints.  Sounds like fun, yes?   What else...I crawled out of bed around 10:30AM, went to the Dr. and various other places, then came home and napped from 5-9:30PM.  That seems to be the only time when the landlord's kids will shut up long enough for me to sleep.  I'm going to go batty this winter when I can't escape the sound of brats!   Less than two weeks to the Classic Metal Show Night Out with Wolfie!  Woohoo, it will be much fun!  I'll also get to see The Jimmy; I haven't seen him in ages.  It shall rock out!   I'm lowering the price on my Marc Jacobs jeans.  You wouldn't believe the stupid assed questions I get about these jeans.  I'm selling them for over $100 off the retail price, and one guy is bitching because the jeans he's interested in only has 7" leg openings, and he wants 8" openings!  If you're going to bitch that much go to Nordies and spend the $140 on the jeans.  Otherwise, shut up and stop wasting my time!   I'm trying to update my homepage but I keep getting error messages.  I can't wait until I learn enough HTML to make my Lawn Bunny page!   OK, I think I'm done.  I promise to update this everyday from now on.   Nighty!

       October 9, 2002   I received the rest of my Burt's Bees stuff today.  Now if my 10 other items would show up I'd be blissfully happy.  I see the B&W 20 eye seller didn't ship my item today like I asked.  A couple other sellers claim they shipped my items already; if so where are they?  I paid over the Priority Mail cost yet no items are here.  I really hate crappy eBay sellers!   I had a joyous time hanging stuff in my room.  Now I have easy access to all of my necklaces, and they don't get all tangled up!   Rog failed to call me again last night.  I should hear from him tomorrow.  One more strike and he's out!  I've known Rog for 10 years and he's never been punctual; he's usually about 2 days off all the time!   I sincerely hope I have something to do tomorrow at work.  I'm only working until 1, though as I need to get my car plates/title taken care of.  I have a sneaking suspicion that the guy I talked to at the BMV was wrong and it's going to be much more difficult that he claimed to get the car transferred into my name.  I better be able to get my TYP O NEG plates dammit!   Fluffy is on crack.   My computer decided to stop printing, lovely.  Once again, I love Protek computers (my Mom and her bright ideas)!  I wish my laptop would hold a charge; I'd hook it up to my cell phone and use it for the Net.  Speaking of cell phones, my phone just rang half a ring and stopped.  The caller ID came up as private; wonder who it was at 9:30PM?  They better leave me a voicemail! Waiting....waiting....waiting.... OK, they didn't.  Asshole!   I'm off to find trouble, byeeeeeee!

       October 7, 2002   Woohoo, all of my eBay items are paid for!  Now I just have to sit back and wait for them to roll in!  I received 4 packages today; some of the Burt's Bees stuff I won, the CD visor for my car, my Marc Jacobs jacket and the Portable Henry Rollins (a book).  I will have a bounty of Docs by this weekend!  I repeat, woohoo!   I guess I'm going to work at my regular time tomorrow.  I have to pick the biddy up from the hospital at 7AM, so I may as well come home, get ready and go to work at the regular time.  That way I'll leave around 1 instead of staying until 5.  I don't know why I'm working all week; it's not like I can handle anything non-eBay related that may come up.  Shit, I can't even handle eBay stuff!  That's it, I'm not working Thursday!

       October 6, 2002   OK, so I'm slacking a little bit.  I didn't get home until 5AM last night and I really didn't have time yesterday to post anything.  Anyway, I went shopping yesterday a little too much!  I did get a new Care Bear, and some cool Hot Wheels for my desk at work.  I also scored the blue/green ruboff Docs I've been lusting over, woohoo me!     I also bought a cute new purse by Joe Boxer and some laundry bags.  I get to do laundry tomorrow after work, won't that be fun?  Hopefully Rog will call tomorrow night as he didn't call tonight like he was supposed to.  Most likely he's passed out somewhere, so that's OK.     I'm working 5 days this week as the boys are going to Hershey on Tuesday.  I'm not working 9-5 all five days though, probably noon to five on Tuesday and Thursday.  I will be posting a lot of stuff as I can only go to UPS so many times a day!  Maybe I'll have enough time to figure out how to post pictures that will show up on all computers and not just mine!   The landlord finally figured out that I don't like her, or her husband.  Princess Perception whom she is, it only took her 3 months!  Sorry, but I have no respect for someone who blatantly lies about things just so she can get someone to move into her rental property. Add to that the fact that she allows her husband to knock her around and I'm just totally unable to like her at all.  Her kids are brats too, and she doesn't seem too smart.  All very big strikes against her ability to be on my "likeable person" list.  I simply can't stand stupidity or people without common sense.  I offer no apologies for it; if you don't like it too bad.   My tomato soup is done; time to eat!

The computers, and Internet connection, at work has me spoiled.  Anyway, I didn't do much of anything today.  I took the heart monitor back to the doctor, and then I stopped at the Lake Cable Fisher's for some Kraft Green Box spaghetti.  Woohoo! I talked to Rog today as well; I guess we're going out Sunday or something.  That should be lots of fun because Rog is a fun guy!   I won a really cute DM shirt on eBay today.

       October 2, 2002   I received my green Dr. Martens boots today!  They are soooooo cute, I think they are my new favorite pair.  I'll try to post a picture soon, and I'll link it from here.   I'm returning the fabric rose boots for an even exchange of "Brontollu" boots.  Hopefully everything goes well as I've had bad luck with returning stuff before having my money refunded.  I'm hoping this works out better as the seller's "number one priority is customer satisfaction."  (I love putting that in there.)  Of course I'll keep everyone updated on the return/exchange status!   I think I'll go watch TV or something.  No one has bought any MJ jeans for a few days, so I have nothing to package.

       October 1, 2002   OK, OK so my first post for October 1 is actually on the 2nd.  Whatever. Today was a decent day, I guess.  I just finished watching the NYPD Blue episode where Smits goes into the hospital.  Two or three more episodes and they croak him.  I've never seen that episode, and I'm sure I'll cry when I do.  I cry at the dumbest stuff!   I went into work to day for a few hours and found out that the museum owner took my Tom away from me.  Now I'm supposed to wrap a 300 pound Jaguar front suspension by myself, and then take it to Greyhound by myself.  Riiiiiiiiight.  Oh sure, the owner said I could have him help me, or some other guy I've never even been introduced to.  Are they going to help me when I need it, or when it's convenient for them?  On a more positive note, the owner did say that I do a very good job and that he's happy with me.  Damn right!  I spend enough time on eBay, I should know what I'm doing by now!   I got my rose boots today and they are too damn small!  They are a UK3 which usually fit me fine, but these most definitely do not fit.  The seller claims in their auction terms that their "number one priority is customer satisfaction."  Lets see how true that really is!  The seller listed the size as 5, so I thought that meant the size on the boot.  That would have made them a UK5 or a US7 which would have more than been big enough.  Hopefully I can return them, but I really wanted the damn boots! On a better note, I also received my DM duffle bag today.  The seller,  urlLink shoozdrew auctions   included a ton of awesome extras!  My favorite is the DM radio.  It's no larger than a 50 cent piece, but it actually picks up about 10 good stations!  Now I don't have to buy a $150 Nike arm radio.  Rock out!  Go to shoozdrew's auctions; it's linked above!   I once again impressed Wolfie with my Internet prowess.  He had been looking for a Great White CD and couldn't find it.  I bought it for him yesterday because I rock out.  You are quite welcome, Wolfie.  I expect a hug the next time we go out.

       Friday November 29, 2002   OK, I have so much crap to do tonight.  I need to make myself a list before I forget half of it.  Shopping: Plato's Closet, Sam's Club, K-Mart, Target and Da Mall.  Pay car payment (ugh, I so much hate my car).  Remember to take my pain meds (I'm not feeling as spacey now, thank you very much).  I'm sure I'm forgetting no less than 5 things, but oh well.  I'm such an impulse shopper and I must stop!  I will only buy one pair of Docs tonight, I don't care how many cute pairs I see.  I need to do my Christmas cards too, but I think that's a good Saturday activity.  I need to visit Saks to get my Mom a pair of jeans.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to find 32X27 jeans?  My Mom is so short and since my Dad died she's been eating too much ice cream (her words, not mine.  I think she looks fine).  She needs to grow some legs!  I'm only 5'3" but I have a 32" inseam, figure that one out!   K, I'm going to roam around the museum.  Byeeeeeeeeee!

       Thursday November 28, 2002   Happy Thanksgiving   Ate at the Cathedral Buffet, saw Ernest Angley and was very frightened.  He walks like a gay man.  Not there's anything wrong with gay men, my best friend is gay (Hi Turtle!), but I figured since he's a "man of god" and it's supposed to be a sin to be gay, he'd try to make sure he didn't "appear gay"-whatever that is.  Ate at Rally's last night because 3 separate KFC's in the Akron/Cuyahoga Falls area were out of the 3 strip meals.  Fuckers.   Have to work tomorrow, goody.   I think I'll snarf down some oyster stuffing then take a nap.  I didn't eat that much at the buffet: 1/2 piece of turkey, some mashed taters and gravy, a little bit of regular "sage" stuffing, one piece of roast beast and two pieces of broccoli with cheese.  Yeah, I got my money's worth alright!   Byeeeeee!

I think it about sums that up.   Plans for today: Relist the Chia-Fiat when it comes offline with no bidders, take pictures of the snow for Steph, stay warm.   Nothing else is going on.

       Monday November 25, 2002   Whew, Steve saved me on Friday.  My tire is fine, somehow I managed to lose all of the air out of it.  I think I may have tightened my tirefly too much, and it let the air leak out.  In any event, I'm back in business without dropping $100 for a tire.   My Christmas shopping is almost finished!  I need to get 5 more presents and that's it.  I can't believe Thanksgiving is Thursday.  I'm hitting the   urlLink Cathedral Buffet   like usual.  For those uninformed few, the Cathedral Buffet is Ernest Angley's Buffet.  Ernest Angely is the "Be Healed" TV evangelist.  He's about 5 feet tall, but damn is his buffet tasty!  Click on the link above it you have the burning desire to see pictures of the buffet.   Lets see, Friday I went to Brown Derby Roadhouse and I grubbed down on a steak and some French Onion soup. Saturday I went to  urlLink West Point Market   for dinner, and had the crabcake BLT minus the L because I'm allergic to lettuce.  Shopping makes me hungry!  I did bring a bag home on Friday though, as I filled up on soup and bread before my steak arrived.  The baked potato was big enough to be a dinner on its own!  I bought some Killer Blondie's at West Point which made a nice dessert.  I love West Point Market!   I have two pairs of sandals waiting for me at home; hopefully I'll be able to purchase more space for my webpage and add the pictures this evening.  I think I'm going to purchase lisa@thelawnbunny.com email too.  We'll see.   I'm off to do work.  Byeeeeeee!

These are the face boots, and TredAir flame boots.  I rock!   I somehow managed to get a flat tire.  Luckily I'm at work, so the guys are going to inflate it for me and make sure it holds air.  If not, they're going to change my tire and slap the spare on it.  Thankfully my spare is full sized.  I may get to buy a new tire tonight, woohoo!  Hamad Tire here I come!   I thought I had found another VW.  There was an ad for an 86 Jetta GL 5-speed in Tuesdays' Repository.  I called about it, and the damn thing was sold.  My luck is completely poopy!  I'm still looking though, and I will find another VW!   Mmmm, I think Roadhouse sounds tasty for dinner tonight.   That's all, byeeeeeeeee!

I checked the fluid levels in my car and my Mom's car, cleaned my car out and finally got around to putting on my seatcovers.  Now my butt won't freeze on the leather seats anymore.  I also scheduled my car for an oil change, tire balance and rotation and the right front tire rotor replacement.  I also cleaned Fluffy's room and vacuumed the rest of the homestead.     That's all I did today, and I think that's more than enough!   Byeeeeeee!

Just a hunch, but your about me page has both feedback from your work, a link to your job, and a link to your journal. They may be investigating the company for shill bidding/feedback harvesting too. I wish there was an auction site as big as ebay, but not owned by them, they suck. JMHO!    And here's my reply:  Who Are Ya?   Lisa  Any Last Requests?   In reply to the entry below:  I think it's spineless that someone reported me to SafeHarbor for having multiple accounts. Some people obviously have too much time on their hands. I DO NOT participate in shill bidding. Would I admit to working at the museum if I were doing anything wrong? No, I don't think so. Besides, we are a non-profit charity and I have to bid on items I want. I can't buy them outright as the items were donated to our museum for fund raising purposes,and to be sold on eBay.  If they booted me for shill bidding, they should have booted my boss too as he bids on museum items as well.  I say it's someone being childish for one reason or another. Questions, Concerns, Threats?   I do appreciate "Mary's" input, and I also agree with her that there needs to be another site just as big as eBay. Just for the record, I was booted from eBay for not paying my seller fees on my PradaPorscheDKNY account. I was suspended under that account, then created this ForensicPsychChick account. The Canton Classic Car Museum DOES NOT condone or participate in shill bidding. If eBay is going after shill bidders why wasn't my boss' eBay account suspended as well? He bids on our items too, from work and home. I will continue to say it's someone who has a problem with me and is being childish. That's OK, I'll continue eBaying and they'll never find out how.      OK, I think that about sums it up!    On a better note, I received the rainbow snakeskin boots today, and my DM watch.  Both rock out.  Bleh, that's it.   Byeeeeeee!

       Tuesday November 19, 2002   Grrr, I got booted off eBay today.  I think that Tiffany ring bitch reported me for creating a second account when my PradaPorscheDKNY account was closed for not paying the 100-some dollar fees I owed.  Now I'll have to do all of my eBay buying through Steph.  It pisses me off!  Hopefully that Tiffany ring bitch gets it from the USPS for mail fraud!   Better things: I got my velvet boots today.  They stank of cigarettes but I Febrezed the hell out of them, so now they're OK.  I have two packages at work that I'll have to pickup tomorrow before I go to Pittsburgh.   I ordered new checks today!  They are Sesame Street checks with Elmo!  I got the matching address labels and checkbook cover too!  Woohoo, I can't wait to get them!  (I like exclamation points.)   Columbia House is having a kick ass deal.  You buy 1 CD at regular price, and you get 3 free!  I have an order for 13 CD's; I can't wait until they get here!   I'm done.  Nighty!

       Monday November 18,  2002   OK, I'm at work bored out of my mind.  I'm talking to Steph on AOL and taking useless pictures of things.  If you'd like to see my  urlLink computer monitor with stuffed animals   or my  urlLink filing cabinet   click on the links.   If I whack my knee on the desk one more time, I'm going to have to throw something.  My knee keeps cracking everytime I move, perhaps I should contact my arthritis doctor?  Nah, that wouldn't be any fun!   I have to take the biddy to the asthma doctor today so I get to leave work early, 4PM.  I won't work again until Friday morning at 9AM as Matthew is supposed to get his new kidney on Wednesday, so I took the day off.  New kidneys rock! I think I'll stop at the mall and buy a jacket I saw over the weekend.  It's a Lauren leather jacket, dark navy blue with grey wool lining.  It's hella warm, and pretty cute too!  I bought a new scarf this weekend, here's a  urlLink picture   of it.  It's toasty warm!   My damn car door was frozen shut this morning so I had to drive the biddy wagon to work today.  I hate Ohio in the winter!   I'm off to do nothing for another hour and 45 minutes!  Byeeeeeeee!

       Sunday November 17, 2002   Whee, I won a pair of patent baby blue Docs for $15.50 (thanks for pointing them out Steph!)!  My rainbow snakeskins are shipping tomorrow!  I'll have them in time for Matthew's kidney transplant on Wednesday.     I've done nothing all day and it has been fun.  I did talk to Rog for a few minutes this afternoon, but I had just woken up so he told me to call him later in the week.  I'm such a bum!   That's it for now!  Byeeeeeee.

       Saturday November 16, 2002   Sorry, my Saturday entry is actually on Sunday morning.  Too bad.   I went Christmas shopping today.  I got almost everyone's presents; hopefully everything fits the twins and Hannah.  They're so tall and thin, I don't see how anything would be too small!  Of course I bought myself some presents too!  I got a scarf from Aeropostale and two Ralph Lauren bags.  No cute Docs to be found today, sigh.   I'm off to bed.  Nighty!

       Thursday November 14, 2002   OK, I'm toally out of control.   I bought 5 pairs of Docs today, yes 5 pairs.  I bought 3 off of eBay, one at Plato's Closet and I ordered one from Mr. Hyde's Leather.  I have issues and I need to find a cheaper habit, perhaps crack would be good?   I also paid my cell phone bill until December and my car payments until January.  It's nice to have money again.   I'm off to list stuff on eBay.  Byeeeee!

       Wednesday November 13, 2002   Coach leather products are the best in the world!  I cleaned and conditioned my dawn blue boots, and you can't even see the scuffs.  Woohoo!   I should get my DM sign tomorrow; none of my other items have shipped.  Grrrrrrr, I hate that!   I changed my homepage; now all of the pictures are linked instead of being on the page.  I figured that would make it easier on people with slow connections or older PC's.  See how nice I am?   I'm at work doing nothing as usual.

I think I'll list some of my Docs on eBay.  I have so many that I've never worn or only worn once or twice.  I'll have to think about that while putting on the new toilet seat.

       Tuesday November 12, 2002   OK, I am officially pissed.  I can't find my Bonham cassette anywhere.  I checked in my car, my room and in my work bag; it's nowhere to be found.  I find the cassette in my tape bag, listen to it, rock out and now it's lost.  Grrrrrrr. I also scuffed the toes of my dawn blue boots yesterday at work, dammit!     I get to change the toilet seat tonight, won't that be fun?  I did get a check for over $800 today, and I'll be getting another for a tick over $300 this week, woohoo!  I believe my savings will be happy again.   I have to start my Christmas list; I need to know exactly what I'm getting everyone so I don't go on one of my usual spending sprees.  I'm buying myself ONE pair of Docs for Christmas, that's it!  My Mom got me the limited edition   urlLink Lancome Juice Bar Juicy Tubes   set yesterday.  It's awesome, but I can't have it until Christmas since it's techinically a Christmas present.  Darn!   I think I'll visit Taco Bell tonight, the steak tacos look good.   Later!

       Monday November 11, 2002   Well now, hasn't today just been the most damn exciting day?  I haven't done anything much to speak of today at work, and I still have an hour to go.  I did relist a pair of Marc Jacobs jeans, and printed out some UPS labels for my packages.  Other than that, nothing is going on.  I added a picture of my LeBaron to my homepage; I hate that car.  It'll be $50 for a new rotor and now my left brake light doesn't work, nor does the light by the back window.  The bulbs and fuses are fine, so I must have another electrical gremlin.  I repeat, I hate my car.  The first $2000 gets it, new engine and all.   I should get a whole buttload of packages on Thursday which means I'll have to come in on my day off.  That's OK, it's for a good cause.  I love getting packages!   That's all for now, byeeeeeeeeeeee!

It was over 70 today, but rained most of the day.  Hopefully it'll be nice tomorrow and not rain!   I cleaned Fluffy's room and paid for the furry boots I won last night.  Other than that, I didn't do much of anything today.   I'm off to do stuff, byeeeeee!

I wake up this morning to homemade bread and butter!  Woohoo again!   Didn't go to the Lords of Acid show last night as I thought I was going to have to pay for all of my eBay items.  Grrrrrrr, I wish I would have known my Mom was going to be nice!  I think she feels guilty about taking all of my money.     It is so not warm out today like it was supposed to be.  I hate Ohio!

It wasn't that warm on my way into work this morning, but it is very comfy out now.  In Ohio we have this thing called winter, and it sucks and snows and it's just icky.  Over 60 degrees in November is a good thing for Ohio!   Finally going to see Jackass tonight, and hopefully going to Joe's Crab Shack for food.   Byeeeeeee!

       Thursday November 7, 2002   Happy Birthday Jeff!  That's my youngest brother, he's 35 today!   I did 4 loads of laundry today, only 4 more to go!  I'll most likely do those Sunday.   I rescheduled my Sportsdome interview for tomorrow after work.  I obviously am not returning to my other job; screw them!  The museum and the Sportsdome should suffice.   Tomorrow is the Lords Of Acid concert in Pittsburgh.  Woohoo!  It shall be quite interesting I'm sure.   I'm so glad I work to pay for everyone else's bills.  I wake up this morning, go into the living room and my Mom immediately starts asking me for money.  Excuse me, but who is getting nasty emails from eBay sellers because she gave all of her money to Mom last weekend?  That would be me.  I told her to call Kieth and tell her she needs some of that money he "borrowed" in August.  Of course she didn't.  My savings is gone, my checking account has about $20 in it, and she's asking me for money.  Right!  She only owes me over a grand, hello!!!   I'm done ranting, it's off to eat some Ben and Jerry's.

       Wednesday November 6, 2002  I went to the doctor yesterday and just didn't feel like updating this, sorry.  I have acute sinusitis, like I didn't already know that!  I also worked from 10A-1:30P at my new job.  I don't think I'll be returning to that job for various reasons.  The biggest reason is that I told them I have no accounting skills and they were fine with it.  Then suddenly yesterday it's a big deal.  Right...  I have an interview at the Sportsdome on Thursday.  I'd only work Sunday nights from 3-8PM, but I think it'd be fun anyway!  I'm at work right now, and I've actually worked all day!  I listed a bunch of  urlLink eBay stuff , updated the museum membership database and sent out membership invoices for November and December.  That has chewed up around 5 hours.  I also bought a pair of shoes on eBay, you didn't think I'd work ALL day, did you?  Heehee!  I'm off to cause trouble.

       Monday November 4, 2002   A humerous thing happened this afternoon on my way home from work.  I was on Market AVE downtown, and I came to the Tusc intersection.  The light turned yellow so I stopped.  Usually I would have kept going as I could have easily made it through the turn, but since there was an accident in the intersection and a slow car in front of me, I thought it wise to stop.  This fat old man gets in front of my car and begins bitching because I'm in the crosswalk.  Mind you, I was not all up in the crosswalk, and he was in no danger walking in front of my car (other than me gassing it and running over his fat ass.)  I was shocked speechless at first, then I recovered my wits and replied to him.  "Excuse me for causing you an inconvenience by not running that red light.  From the looks of your fat ass you can use the exercise, so walk those few extra steps around my car."  I was quite proud of myself, and the old fart just looked at me.  I'm all for respecting old people, but come on, he needed to simmer down. I rock!   I start my new job tomorrow!  Actually it's a "trial day" from 10A-1P just to make sure it's something I want to do.  Duh, I fiddle on the Net, do payroll, pay bills and make over $10/hour.  It's something I like!  It pays way more for two days a week than the museum does for three days a week.  I'll work at my new job on Monday and Friday, and at the museum on Tuesday and Thursday.  Just in time for Christmas, too!  I had to get a second job as my Mom keeps taking my money for bills because she loaned Kieth all of our money and he never paid it back.  She also only works two days a week.  Duh, work more! I plan on moving out the first of the year as long as I enjoy my new job and have continued to enjoy working there.  I'll also be taking Fluffy with me when I move.  I have to get a couch, a TV, DVD player, computer (this one is my Mom's and the laptop is too old), two tables, and a microwave.  I have everything else from the last time I moved out, including a chair, dishes and all of that other domestic stuff.  Oh, I'll need a vacuum too!  I'm sure it won't be too hard, especially with the money I'll be pulling down.   I believe that's all for now.  I have to go to the bank; my Mom needs more money.   Byeeeeee!

You have to scroll to the bottom of the page, and click on the link for the "9 year old gets kidney" article.  Julie donated a kidney to Matt the day after Christmas.  They are both doing well, and Julie may go home tomorrow.  If that does happen, I'm driving my Mom to Pittsburgh to pick Julie up, then my Mom's staying with her until Thursday or Friday.  For Julie not wanting us around originally she's sure calling us enough now.  Maybe this will straighten her up, but I doubt it.  If my Dad dying didn't change her ways, nothing will.  I'll be happy just to see Matt.   Off to the Scheib to package stuff.   Byeeeeeeeee!

       Sunday December 29, 2002   Ugh, I gotta do returns today.  Both of my sapphire bracelets broke; the clasps snapped right off.  I had a feeling that was going to happen, so I saved my receipts.  I also have to return that shitty digi cam I bough three weeks ago at Office Max.  It only works half of the time, and if they give me lip about being over the 14 day return limit I'll just say it was a gift.  So I gotta hit Office Max, Dillard's and Kaufmann's.  Won't that be fun?   I added a new feature to my blog; the shoe for the day picture.  That's the picture of the shoes I'm wearing today.  If it's the same picture as they day before I'm either not going anywhere or I'm wearing the same pair of shoes two days in a row (it does happen once in a while).  As you can see, I have way too much time on my hands.   OK, gotta make myself pretty.  Byeeeee!    Playlist Depeche Mode "Black Celebration" (Entire CD)

       Saturday December 28, 2002   Why are those kids up at 11PM screaming their heads off?  Oh, because their parents are crackheads...   I purchased the HP PhotoSmart 320 digi cam last night.  It's really nice, but my piece of shit PC won't upload the pictures.  I can print directly from my HP printer, so I know the camera isn't broken.  I need to call the HP support folks and see if I'm missing a driver or something.  I hope I can rig my computer to work with the cam because it's a really nice camera and I'd like to keep it.     My car's thermostat was sticking, and Montrose actually fixed it for free with no bitching on my part.  I almost fell over.  Hopefully it decides to be a nice car for at least a month or so.  : )   It snowed again.  Argh!   I cleaned Fluffy's room today, and rustled around the apartment.  Nothing too exciting to report today.     Byeeeeee!

       Friday December 27, 2002   Yeah, I know.  Four days without an update, but you'll soon see why there wasn't!   OK, Tuesday I wake my lazy self up at around 10:30AM.  Wrap some last minute stuff, get ready and hit the road to Cuyahoga Falls by 2PM.  Make crazy assed time to the Falls, 45 miles in 25 minutes, and get to Uncle Jimmy's shindig before four.  This is after I realize I forgot the waffle maker at home, and have to run to Wal-Mart for a gift card to use as the exchange gift.  I also picked up a Pur water filter set thing for Kieth and Tricia (which they loved).  Eat at Uncle Jimmy's, score a Dirt Devil baby vacuum and a cocoa and cookie set thingie, then race back home around 7PM.  Leave my house to go back to the Falls at 10PM and it's icing outside.  Wake up Christmas morning in the Falls and there's about 7 inches of snow (love the snowbelt).  Uck.  I walked over to my car and sunk into snow up to my knees.  I hate Ohio.  I was stuck in the Falls from Christmas Eve to the day after Christmas.  Yesterday I went to Kaufmann's to spend my gift card (DKNY zippy sweatshirt), West Point Market to spend my gift card (Burt's Bees marshmallow and melon moisturizer) and Borders to spend that gift card as well (serial killer book and some marble magnets).  I also hit Barnes and Noble for next years' Christmas cards.  Around 6PM I decide to go home.  I get about a half a mile onto Route 8 and my car temp gauge is all the way up.  I pulled off at the Howe AVE exit and into the Sheetz lot.  I had to have my car towed to Montrose in Louisville last night due to the overheating trick it decided to pull in 20 degree weather.  I'm hoping the shit Montrose pulled in May caused the head to crack.  That would rock!  It has a warranty so I don't even want to hear it from them.  I'll let the piece of shit sit over there before I pay them another dime for any work done to the engine.   Yesterday was also new kidney day for Matthew!  He and my sister (the donor) are doing much better than expected.  I would have gladly given him a kidney, but Julie was a perfect match.  I guess as soon as they had the new kidney properly "hooked up" he started peeing everywhere.  Teehee!   I have sandals at home, but no damn ZIP Drive.  That seller sucks ass!   I'm going tonight to purchase a new digi cam so be prepared for lots of pictures!   Detroit Auto Show January 11-20.  Be there or be square!   Later! Byeeeeeeeeeee!

       Monday December 23, 2002~IT'S ANIME DAY!!!   Ugh, I just returned from K-Mart.  I hate that store to begin with, but with it being Christmas Eve Eve it was even worse.  People have no manners at all anymore.  What exactly does "Excuse me" mean to you?  Obviously it's a foreign phrase to a lot of people.  I forgot a gift exchange gift, so I got to visit K-Mart.  I scored a waffle maker, and it's a nice one too!  My first trip in my Anime Docs is to K-Mart, such blasphemy.   Fluffy much enjoys my DM boxes because he's silly.   I think that's all.

       Sunday December 22, 2002   Woohoo, I went to Mr. Hyde's this afternoon.  I purchased a pair of 14 eye dual zipper boots in Cosmic.  I'll have a picture of them on my site tomorrow as my digi cam is dead so I have to use the one at work.  That same bitch was working at Mr. Hyde's, and I really can't stand her.  Grrrrrrr.   Fluffy is enjoying his blankie in the bathroom.  Such a silly kitty.   Tomorrow is my last day of work until Friday!  I'm sure I'll wind up caving in and going to work on Thursday, or maybe I'll just answer email from home.  I do know I absolutely must package that crap and ship it out tomorrow.  I have about 10 items to package, and we have a bunch more coming off tomorrow.  Love my job.   I think I'll clean the bathroom, then tidy up my room.  I also have to clean and protect my new boots!   Byeeeeeee!

       Late Saturday Evening December 21, 2002   We finally put our tree up tonight, and I think we did a very good job.  Too bad you can't tell from my crappy photo.  I really need a new digi cam.   I have to return my Tiffany ring due to its discoloration.  I guess I can't handle the copper content in the ring, or at least that's what the Tiffany representative told me.  Grrrrrrrr, the ring's really cute and I so much don't want to return it.   I didn't hit Mr. Hyde's today, I'm saving that little foray for tomorrow.    Henry Rollins is doing a spoken word tour, and he's going to be at the Cleveland Odeon on January 26.  You know I already have my ticket, duh!   Didn't do much today, but I did have piping hot pizza and put the tree up.  I think that's quite a productive Saturday.     I'm off to try and sleep.  Nighty!

       Friday December 20, 2002   Quick update before I go home.  Don't know about the apartment yet, and my Tiffany ring is changing color.  What the fuck is going on?     On a better note, the guys (Gary, Bob and Tom) got me a $50 gift certificate to Mr. Hyde's Leather!  Woohoo, a new pair of Docs are in my very near future!   More later, gotta go!

       Wednesday December 19, 2002   I finally broke down and did some laundry.  Four loads, which was all of my jeans, and some shirts.  I forgot to wash any towels so I guess I have to steal some of my Mom's.     We looked at the apartment today, and put down a deposit.  We'll find out tomorrow for sure if we get it.   I received my Flamer Shoes today, and my California Car Cover order.  I think I'm going to order the thinner Tiffany ring that matches my thick Tiffany ring.  The thinner one is only $74!  I'm going to Kaufmann's later this evening to buy a sapphire and diamond bracelet that's really pretty, and quite cheap too.  It's not as inexpensive as the last one I got there, but I think this new one is prettier.  I'll check out the Coach counter while I'm there, and the Docs too!   I actually didn't go into work today, I'm so proud of myself.     Gotta go, Fluffy's attacking my laundry bags.  Bad kitty!   Byeeeeee!

       Thursday December 19, 2002   This is what I get for taking a nap this evening after work.  It is 20 after 3 in the AM and I can't sleep.  I know this always happens when I take a nap after work, but I'm soooo tired when I get home that I can't help myself.  Dammit!   My two packages were my Juicy Tube and my Tiffany & Company ring!  It arrived a day early, which is quite cool.  My flamer TredAirs didn't arrive as promised.  I don't think the girl even sent them yet, as the Delivery Confirmation number she gave me comes up as being invalid.  Don't lie to me about shipping an item; ship it when you're supposed to!  I emailed her, but she hasn't replied.   If I have one more person email me for work requesting their total due, I'm going to punch someone.  I sent an email and an eBay invoice at the end of each auction today.  Both emails had the total due, including shipping.  I received 5 emails today from people requesting their totals.  Two were legitimate though, as I needed one persons' shipping info to calculate shipping charges, and the other person wants to combine shipping to Canada.  The other three people need to pay more attention to their email.  I'm sure I'll have a ton more emails like that when I check the mail again.  Are people getting more and more stupid, or is it just me expecting too much from people?   On to happier subjects...I go look at the apartment tomorrow/today at 11:15AM.  If I like it, which I'm sure I will, we're going to take it.  I plan on beginning packing this weekend.  I need to find some way to store my shoes in the least amount of space.  I don't think this new apartment has a bedroom as big as my current room, but if that's the only thing I can find wrong with it, I'll be blissfully happy!  I do know the thought of a gas stove is spooky; I can see myself blowing up the kitchen.  I'm used to electric cooking, and I don't like change when it comes to major appliances!  Oh well, I'm sure I'll get used to it.   I have such a horrible memory that I had to walk around work today with a note taped to my sweater sleeve.  I kept forgetting what I needed to do, so I finally made a list and taped it to myself.  Strange looking, but it works.  And since when did I care about strange looking?   Please, before emailing me, run a spell check!  Good lord.     I think I'm finished bitching for this evening.  Just in case anyone is wondering, the picture on my blog is my LeBaron's rusted through exhaust pipe.  Tell me again why Chryslers are still allowed on the road?   Nighty (I hope)  Byeeeeeee!

       Early Tuesday Morning December 17, 2002   Gary gave me attitude all afternoon; I wonder if he managed to "stumble upon" my journal again?  I could give a rats' ass to be honest.  Yes, I love my job, but I don't get paid enough to put up with bullshit.  I do my job well, and all of our bidders are kept happy.  I also do a lot more than just eBay stuff, so I don't even want to hear it.     Per usual, I was asshole tired all day long, and now I'm wide awake.  My 4 hour nap probably didn't help much, but I was soooooo worn out from doing nothing.  Uck, I hope I find out what's wrong with me tomorrow.  I'm sure the fact that this apartment is never kept at a constant temperature doesn't help; nor does the fact that I don't listen to my doctor about not going into work when I'm sick.   I now have to buy Jeff's birthday and Christmas presents and that is it!  I just bought Tom and Denny's presents this evening via the Net.  How I love Internet shopping.  I received my Recaro seat cell phone holder today; it's soooooo cute!  The instructions are in Japanese though, so I had to make do with the pictures.  Hopefully I'm smart enough to figure out the cell phone holder.  I'll take a picture of it in my car once I get it mounted.  (Yeah, I just said "mounted".  Teehee)   I still haven't mailed my Christmas cards; I suck.  I really need to get those mailed like tomorrow.  I'm such a procrastinator.   I'm off to watch some TV, or maybe I'll watch a movie.  Halloween 5 or Dirty Harry sound good, as does Cruel Intentions.     Nighty!

Who comes in sick all the time?  I think it's me.  I have another appointment with the Doctor tomorrow; I hope I have mono.  That would be hella funny.   I'm off to help Norm with the raffle tickets.  Later.

I have plenty of shirts for work, therefore I think I need to buy about 5 more pairs of jeans.   OK, I'm going home as I've been here since 2 this afternoon.  Ugh.   Byeeeeeeeee!

Now I'm going to install AOL Broadband on our computer.  Hopefully the computer can handle it!   Fluffy's grounded as he was on the kitchen counter when I got up.  Bad kitty!

They have our insurance info soooooo screwed up.  I pitched a fit and felt better.  I'm such an ass.   I absolutely have to do laundry this weekend.  And I must clean Fluffy's room today.  Damn cat.   I ordered my Tiffany & Company ring today!  I can't wait to receive it.  It's from the 1837 collection, and it's so pretty.  Woohoo me!

       Wednesday December 11, 2002   Argh, I have had three calls in the last 15 minutes that are some stupid recording.  On my cell phone nonetheless.  How are telemarketers getting my cell phone number?  Once again, argh!   I'm still sick but since I'm high on Ultram I feel much better.  I have a doctor appointment for tomorrow at 2:30PM.  I'm sure I'll get jabbed, but that'll be a reason to buy something!   It's snowing hella hard right now, so I'm not sure if I'm going to get to Belden Village this evening for the flowered Nike's.  I'll be pissed if I drive up there and they're gone.  Grrrrrrrrr!   Well I'm going to run across the street before it gets any worse outside.  I'll jabber on some more when I get back.

       Tuesday December 10, 2002   Late Tuesday evening entry....   Didn't get to the doctor today as there were no appointments available.  So I still feel like shit and will most likely feel worse tomorrow.     Didn't get any shopping done as the check I deposited yesterday didn't post yet.  I did manage to find a pair of Birkenstock sandals for $5.80, and I could buy those.  You know I did!  Once I buy a new camera I'll get a picture of them online.     I feel asleep this afternoon watching an Eric Roberts movie (In Cold Blood).  I woke up and had drooled all over myself.  Lovely, I know.   That's it, I'm off to bed for the night.

       Tuesday December 10, 2002   I woke up with a headache this morning.  Not fun.  I've tried calling the doctor for the last 2 hours and they are out to lunch.  Must be nice!  The left side of my face is swelled up, and I feel generally icky.  Not fun.   Hair appointment Saturday at 1PM.  I may go a little shorter, we'll have to see.     I received the Wear Aer shoes today.  The leather is all discolored so they look used.  The seller is really honest though, and said they were sitting in a warehouse a long time before she sold them. For $15 I'm not gonna complain, I just wanted to make sure they were new before I wore them.  I don't mind wearing used boots/sandals after I spray the hell out of them with a disinfectant, but I can't bring myself to wear used tennie shoes; I'm weird I know.   Off to try the doctor office again, and to make myself pretty.  I'm going to try and finish my Christmas shopping tonight, but I'm sure I won't feel like it.   Byeeeee!

       Monday December 9, 2002   I received my checks and address labels today!  They are so hella cute that I can't wait to write a check.  I finally started on my Christmas cards last night, and I'll be able to mail them tomorrow.  I can't believe it's only 17 days until Christmas.   I also received the Atlas boots and Oxford slingbacks from Steph.  Both pairs are hella cool, as expected.  Steph is sooooooo awesome!  She won me a pair of flame TredAir oxfords today, and I also won a cute DM watch.  Speaking of watches, I bought 2 more Joe Boxer watches in addition to the one I bought last night.  At $10 each I couldn't resist.  I need to hit another K-Mart because my local K-Mart's selection sucks.  I'm still pissed that Joe Boxer seems to be exclusive to K-Mart.  The quality of the bed linens went waaaaaay down, as did the quality of the purses.  I never owned a pre K-Mart JB watch, so I can't give an educated opinion of that quality change.  Hopefully they'll last a while.  I never really went into K-Mart that much, but now that they have JB I practically live there.   Buying a new digi cam this weekend.  I think I'll get the Kodak cam with the docking station.  No more time consuming uploading shit for me!   K, I'm really going this time!  Nighty.   Byeeeeeee!

       Sunday December 8, 2002   Woohoo, I think we're moving next month (January)!  I so didn't want to, but now I so much do.  Here's the deal.  Our apartment sucks ass.  I mean this wholeheartedly because it's true.  It's big, and my room is hella big, but that can only count for so much.  The windows are so shitty Fluffy's whiskers blow in the breeze that races through the cracks in the windows.  The neighbors are loud, their kids are louder and the husband is a dick and I've told him so quite a few times.  They are still keeping my mail hostage, and it's still pissing me off.  The apartment we found is back in East Canton, has a basement, a garage and 3 bedrooms!  It also has a living room, dining room, 1.5 potty rooms and a kitchen.  Basement=washer/dryer hookups.  Woohoo, no more laundromat!  I so much hope they will let Fluffy move in with us.  I guess my Mom knows the dude, so that shouldn't be a problem.  I'll paint my new room lavender, as the guy doesn't care if you paint as long as it's a good job. Of course not, what landlord would bitch about a free paint job on his property!  I found some nifty paint that's over 80% food grade products, and it doesn't stink!  I so much hope we like the apartment and that Fluffy can move in with us.     Ate at Subway, and it was tasty.   I went Christmas shopping today, and there were no Iomega Zip Drives to be found.  So I cruised past a jewelry display and wound up buying a diamond stud, a tanzanite ring and a watch.  Too bad if you don't like it, I'm happy with it.     My lips are really chapped from the cold sore medicine, but at least the damn thing's almost gone.  It should be but a mere memory by Tuesday morning.   Gonna go drink my milk and wait for the Sopranos to start.  I think I'll call Jenny too and see how she's doing.   Byeeeeeee!

The email function keys don't work with AOL, but I'm sure that's because AOL sucks.  I'd really like to get the wireless Net but my computer probably wouldn't be able to handle it.  I really need to have it repaired before the warranty runs out.     I found a ton of cheap VW's in Michigan, but none in Ohio.  I checked autotrader.com, cars.com and the newspaper.

Around 1:30 this afternoon, my cousin and his family came over.  They are STILL HERE and it is 8:45.  The last time they came over they did this shit and I told my Mom to tell them to leave the next time.  Well obviously she hasn't yet tonight.  This is so fucking rude, I'm about to go tell them about themselves.  Have some common sense people.   Jani Lane was a no show last night, teehee!  I emailed Metal-Sludge, but I'm sure they won't use my email.  I'll blog the email on Monday when I get to work.     I'm off to fume about these people still being here.  Sheesh.

       Thursday December 5, 2002   This camera is a piece of shit.  It will not download the images, and I'm very pissed about it.  My good digital camera decided to break today so I am stuck without an operable digi cam.  The Firehouse/Jani Lane/Warrant show is tomorrow, Friday, night.  I need to buy a camera in between the time I get off work at 5:30 and the time the doors open for the show at 7:30.  Deduct an hour for driving time and that leaves me with an hour to find a kick ass digi cam, figure out how to use it and get to the show.  Fucking technology!   I still haven't found a VW.  Why are there none available when I have the cash to buy one, then when I've piddled all of my cash on Docs there are 50 gabillion VW's for sale?   My Mom keeps going on and on about her teeth being clean.  She went to the dentist today and can't get over what a good job they did.  It's like she's never been to the dentist before!  I had to cancel my appointment due to my icky cold sore, which is almost gone, and my arthritis doctor appointment which was at 1:45.  My dentist appointment was for 1:30, so obviously that wasn't going to to work.  I have no cavities, never have, and am having no problems with the teeths, so I figured going to the arthritis doc was more important.  In case you were dying to know, I rescheduled the tooth appointment for December 26 at 4PM.   I just realized that my bangs are way too long so I need to call Sherri tomorrow and make a hair appointment.  Hopefully I'll get in before Christmas.  I may get my hair colored too, it all depends on what mood I'm in when I make the appointment tomorrow.   I sincerely hope I have more to do tomorrow at work than I did Wednesday.  I know I have to package a few things, and run to the PO to ship an item to a foreign eBayer.  Other than that, I can't think of anything that needs done.  Hopefully Bob will have a bunch of stuff for me to list.   I am so insanely pissed right now.  My good digi camera won't take pictures for shit either.  I'm going to post a pic of my Ladybugs now, but I'll get a better picture of them tomorrow at work.  Hopefully the camera at work is still operable.  Remember, the picture I'm posting now was taken by the same camera as all of my other pictures. What's going on?   Here's the  urlLink Ladybug Mules  .  Yes, I'm wearing sandals to work tomorrow in 20 degree weather.  I love my Docs that much.   Just so you know, I started this entry right before midnight.  That's why I have it as being a Thursday entry, but Blogger has it as a Friday entry.  Not that anyone is that anal about my journal, but I wanted to make sure any confusion was cleared up.     If I don't go to bed soon I am going to wind up throwing both of these damn cameras out of the window, and most likely the CPU as well.     Nighty!

       Thursday December 5, 2002   I received the Ladybug Docs today!  They are hella cute, and they fit!  They're only a UK3 so I was worried about the fit, but I was pretty sure I could take a UK3 in this style, and I was right.  I just bought a new digi camera today and I can't get it to upload images.  As soon as I figure it out, I'll have a picture of the Ladybugs on here and on my page, www.thelawnbunny.com.   My Mom went Christmas shopping tonight, and I tagged along.  She got everyone's presents except Julie and Tricia (my sisters-in-law).  She also got me a DKNY outfit and a Glenville State Alumni sweatshirt.  I couldn't believe we found a Glenville sweatshirt in Ohio!   Mom bought a new keyboard since I have a tendency to pound the hell out of the keys.  The letters were all worn off of the home row, and since she can't type by touch, she was having quite a time trying to email people.  This new keyboard has all kinds of cool buttons, and it matches our mouse (I'm such a girlie girl).   I'm off to try and figure out this damn camera.  Byeeeeeee!

       Wednesday December 4, 2002   I left work at 4 this afternoon, came home and took a nap.  I feel much better now.  I'll pop into work tomorrow sometime to pick up my Lady Bug Docs, and to check on email and stuff.     What is the deal with people and their high beams?  Four people flashed me today so I was an ass and turned my high beams off and on a bunch of times at each of the jackasses.  Hello, my LeBaron has four headlights.  The outer two are the normal lights, and all four are high beams.  Then you get the asses who drive with their high beams on all the time, even during the daytime.  These are always the asses who only have one low beam light, so they run with their high beams all time because they're too cheap or lazy to replace the burned out low beam bulb.  Stop drinking beer and buy some low beams.     What's the deal with Christina Aguilera?  Other than the fact that she's a dirty whore, what's with her arm waving whoa-whoaing?  Fancy theatrics do not impress me.  People who can sing, and achieve recognition without theatrics, do.  Stop with the publicity stunts (ie: the dirty video) and start singing if you're so good.  She has a good voice but her image and her whoa-whoaing ruins it for me.   I was all pissed because I thought I was going to have to throw another chunk of cash at the LeBaron.  My Mom is fixing the driver side quarter window, the driver side door and my brake lights as a Christmas present.  I have to pay for an oil change, a new brake rotor and tire balance/rotation.  The brake bulbs and fuses are fine, so I must have another electrical gremlin.  How I love American cars.   No stars/stripes boots today, and no Metal-Sludge grab bag either.  Grrrrrrrr.   Friday night at the Boot Scootin Saloon in Cuyahoga Falls...Jani Lane/Warrant/Firehouse.  It shall rock out.  I'll take many pictures of Jani and his mohawk.   I think that's enough for tonight.  Nighty!

       Wednesday December 4, 2002   Well, I am actively searching for another VW.  I must have one by Christmas!   The Lady Bug Docs will arrive tomorrow!  I should have received my Metal Sludge Grab Bag today.  Woohoo, I can't wait to see what's in it!  I'm at work now, but I so much want to go home.  Argh!   Still have a cold sore.  Ick.   I see Blogger added an "upload file" icon.  Woohoo!  Now if I didn't already have all of my files on my homepage server, I'd be excited!    That's it.  Byeeeeeeeeee!

       Tuesday December 3, 2002   Steph sent me a link this morning for some Docs on eBay.  Yes, they are Lady Bug Doc Mules.  You know my ass had her use Buy It Now on them.  $75 but they're soooooo worth it.  I'll pay for them tomorrow via PayPal and I should have them Friday.  Woohoo me!  THANKS STEPH!   Today was a day off from work so I cleaned Fluffy's room, cleaned my room and took out the trash.  I was going to do laundry but somehow managed to put it off all day.  I was on my way to KFC when Steph Instant Messaged me to confirm the Lady Bug purchase.  I was a polite motorist and waited for a redlight before replying.  I miss my old Ericsson; it had a keyboard for surfing the Net.  This crappy Qualcomm doesn't.  I think I'll treat myself to a PCS Vision phone soon; they're hella cute and I'm all about bells and whistles.   How can KFC be out of chicken?  It happened yet again.  You'd think a chicken place would insure they had enough of their product to last them through the work day.     I have a cold sore and I am pissed.  It's probably from my snow adventures over the weekend.  My lips get chapped and I get a cold sore.  I forgot my Burt's Bees Lip Balm (the best next to Prada, in my opinion) so I guess I deserve it.  I have a prescription from the dentist for some stuff and it seems to be working.  Lets hope it doesn't get all big and scabby.  Yuck!   Tomorrow is work.  I hope I have a lot of shit to do like I did Monday.  It made the day go so much faster!   I'm off to have some Sierra Mist and see if my phone's charged yet.  I'd like to use it sometime tonight!

       Monday December 2, 2002   Woohoo, I sold the green steel toe 3 eyelet Docs!  I've worn them once as they are way too big.  See, I can still sell stuff and not be on eBay.  HA!   My windburn is much better.  Old Man Winter is evil!  The snow is gone, though so that's good at least.   I'm at work getting ready to package some eBay items.  We sold some Motorola head units, and some wheel covers (hubcaps to you and me).    More later.  Byeeeeeeeeee!

I just got home from the Falls, now I get to clean Fluffy's box.  Woohoo!   I got the Picasso boots today; I guess Steph is going to trade me either her heart boots or map boots.  Either pair is fine by me as both rock out!     Byeeeee!

       Saturday November 30, 2002   Saturday's post on early Sunday morning...Deal with it.   It like snowed and stuff.  Roughly 5 inches in 4 hours.  I went to Chapel Hill Mall and bought myself a Lucky Brand shirt, some Christmas hair things and some Care Bears perfume.  I'll have pics when I get home tomorrow.  I'm currently snowed in in Cuyahoga Falls.  I rolled down the sledding hill; no piddly sleds for me.  I'm a hardcore snowbunny!  I was very dizzy and almost yakked twice.  Mind you, this was around midnight and four cops drove by in less than 20 minutes.  But then the Falls cops are asses.   I didn't find any cute Docs today, but I will hit Plato's Closet tomorrow if the roads are better and get the Picasso Docs.  Steph wants them, so I may be getting either her map boots or her heart boots in trade.  Woohoo!  I better be able to drive home tomorrow, I have to work Monday.  Not to mention my stars/stripes Docs should come Monday!  I can't wait!  I wore my Dawn blue boots out to play in the snow.  My feet were warm and dry.  I love Docs!   Time to get under the comfy comforter, in the comfy bed.  Nighty!   Playlist  Danzig "I Luciferi: 777"

Sounds fun, doesn't it?   I gave my notice today at work.  My last day is March 1.  I'll miss most of the people I work with, but I won't miss the stress or the psycho owner.

      Wednesday January 29, 2003   I didn't take my car to Montrose today.  I figured I'll take it in tomorrow afternoon and use my Mom's car on Friday if I want to go anywhere.  There's not point in taking her car to work tomorrow, when I can take the beast in after 5 tomorrow night.  There's no puddle underneath it, so I have no idea what's going on.  Other than the fact that it's a Chrysler, that is.   I took my Mom to the doctor today, and she decided to loan me the exhaust money.  I guess she got to thinking last night, and decided it would be a wise investment.  At least I pay her back!   I'm off to the bank; I need to check my balance and see if I want to transfer some over from my savings.  Ack!   Byeeeeeeee!

      Tuesday January 28, 2003   I think my car has a cracked head!  Woohoo!  Why am I happy about this you ask?  Allow me to briefly explain...I had a new engine put in the car in May ($3000 worth of new engine).  They kept insisting the engine was supposed to run at over 200 degrees.  I kept insisting that it wasn't, and finally they agreed to check the thermostat.  THERE WAS NO THERMOSTAT IN THE CAR!  They didn't put one in when they replaced the engine.  I knew that hadn't, but they kept insisting there was at thermostat in the car.  For 2 weeks I ran the car in hot temps without a thermostat.  Now it's overheating, steaming and stinking of anitfreeze, all in below freezing temps.  They shall have to replace the head, and give me a loaner car to boot!  I'm taking it in tomorrow with a list of shit that's wrong with it, and a letter from the mechanic at work stating what he thinks is wrong with the car.  You may wonder why I'm being so assy about the whole deal.  Well this will be the 6th time I've had to take the car over there for shit they did wrong, or didn't do at all.  They dented the hood when they replaced the engine, and tried to get out of that.  I just happened to have photos of my car prior to its going to the garage, so they "fixed" that without too much bitching on my part.  This is the Chrysler dealer mind you, not some private garage.  Do not go to the Montrose family of auto dealerships! Along the same lines, I asked my Mom to borrow $100 so I can get my exhaust done.  I have the money, but I don't want to dip into my savings account.  She said no!  But then she'll loan Kieth money hundreds, or thousands, at a time.  I pay her back, but Kieth doesn't.  Figure that one out.   I came home from the bank just a few minutes ago, and got stuck in the driveway.  So I'm parked halfway in our parking area and halfway in the rest of the driveway.  I'm waiting for them to say something to me about it.  I'll mention the fact that they don't shovel anything, I've fallen in the driveway and that I still have no heat in my room.  That should shut them up about fast, and if not oh well.   No work until Thursday!  Then I'm off the whole weekend.  Once again, my new schedule kicks ass.   I'm off to go grumble about needing to take funds out of my savings account.   Byeeeeeee!

      Sunday January 26, 2003   UPS never ceases to amaze me.  Why do they insist upon some packages being delivered directly to the owner, and others being left at the location?  Perhaps it's something I should research further.  : )~   Woohoo, my Campers arrive tomorrow as does my GreenLightOffice.com order.  I love that place!  I'm addicted to office supplies, and GreenLightOffice.com has the best prices!  Their packaging sucks, but at least it gets here pretty quickly (usually the next day) and shipping is only $5.  I ordered some stampers for work, and some things to spruce up my Docs too.   I need to unload my images and get them posted.  I hate that my PC only has two USB ports.  My printer, camera, mouse and Net connection all run off of a USB connection.  Luckily I also have the printer set up through my Zip Drive's parallel port, so that still works.  But if I want to unload images and be on the Net at the same time, I have to unplug my mouse.  I need to find the converter thingie that came with the mouse, but I guess I'd need to find the box first.  I have this thing about not throwing out any boxes, so it's not going to be an easy task.    I plan on going to NYC sometime in March and I don't care if anyone goes with me or not.  I will go and have fun, even if it's by myself.   The happy things I was babbling about on Wednesday's entry didn't come to fruition.  One was a possible new VW, and the other was a possible new house.  The VW was $2000 down, and since I'm only willing to do $1000 down that didn't work out.  The house was cool, but no one was there when we arrived.  This was after walking a good quarter mile in the 20 degree below zero weather.  Needless to say, I called the owner and gave her quite a piece of my mind.  Bitch.   I fell in the driveway on Thursday evening.  Of course I bitched and complained, but it did no good.  The landlords are soooooo lazy, they don't do anything.  I've lived here 7 months, and have heard the vacuum 5 times total.  Now maybe she vacuumed when I wasn't here, but still, 5 times total?  Ack!  I vacuum at least twice a week and that's if I'm feeling sick.  Usually I vacuum at least once a day.  Some people are so icky.  I guess today my Mom saw Louie tie a rope to the bumper of his truck, and the other end to a sled.  Then he stuck his 3 year old son on the sled and proceeded to drive around pulling his son on the sled.  He even pulled him out into the street, which I didn't think was too damn safe.  The 13 year old girl next door was being "led around" too, but at least she's older.  Fucking crackheads, all of them.   I finally got on the chai wagon and tried some.  It's actually pretty damn good!  I am now addicted to tea, and buy up any new kinds I get my beany little eyes on.  I bought some at West Point Market last night, but haven't had the chance to try it yet.  Tea is your friend!   I think my cell phone battery has just about had it.  I have to charge it an awful lot, and it runs down really quickly too.  I'll buy a new battery just in case as my car did it's little temperature trick again last night.  Here it is, 3:30 in the morning during a moderate snowstorm and my car is overheating.  Figure that one out!  I'll take it in for an oil change tomorrow, and I'll take it to Montrose on Wednesday.  Willie's Muffler is going to charge me $70 for a new connecting pipe, muffler and hangie things.  Not too shabby as AutoZone wanted $85 just for the pipe and muffler.  Willie asked me where I worked and I told him "the museum up the street".  He then decided to make the price even lower, and told me he'll give me the "real" price when I get it done.  Rock out!   OK, I just noticed that my entries for yesterday are listed below, but aren't showing up on the Net.  I shall copy and paste.  Now they are showing up, so I copied and deleted.     I'm done, byeeeeeeee!    Playlist:  Rockstar Soundtrack

       Monday January 20, 2003   I know, how dorky of me was my last post?  Too bad!   I went shopping tonight for my Moms' birthday, and wound up buying all kinds of shit for myself too.  I got two pairs of jeans and three sweaters, plus a VS bra and another Primal Elements soap.  Like I need more clothes, or more soap for that matter.  I wound up buying my Mom a candle and a Fenton candle holder.  I also got her an Origins Ginger Souffle soap bar, but I had to order that from the Origins website as the crappy Canton malls don't have an Origins counter.  I felt like an ass as I was very adamant at the Clarins counter.  I was insisting that Clarins made the soap, and as I was leaving the second Clarins counter I realized that Origins made it; NOT CLARINS.  I know, such shopping hi-jinks.   I changed my work schedule.  I now work Mondays from 1-5 and Tuesdays/Thursdays from 9-5.  I'm off Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Woohoo!   Fluffy is a spaz.   Here's a question;  Why would you keep coming back to read my blog if you think it sucks?  Just a question.    OK, I must do laundry tomorrow.  As my car door is finally fixed, it should be much easier loading and unloading my car.  I'm sure I'll wind up not doing any laundry, but it's a thought at least.   I should receive eBay packages tomorrow.  I'll be hella pissed if I don't.   I'm off to the bank.   Byeeeeeeeee!

My car is so awesomely fixed.  I love being able to use all of the power seat goodies, and being able to get into my car from the passenger side!  I may even wash it tomorrow.   I bought two new pairs of Docs Friday night; they'll be on my page today as well.   As usual, Kieth isn't going to pay my Mom as promised.  He used the usual "I need heating oil" excuse.  Nice.

My car goes to the doctor today, and will be finished tomorrow by early afternoon.  I'll finally be able to use the driver side door again, and the real weather strip will be installed too.  I can't wait!   I have to take my Mom to the license bureau today as Monday is her birthday and her license expires along with her tags.  I may as well have the address changed on my license, too.  Or maybe not as I plan on getting out of this pit within the next couple months.  I most certainly do not plan on being here this spring.  Ugh.   I suppose I should get ready.  My Mom had a doctor appointment at 2, and the license bureau closes at 5.     Byeeeeee!

After we pay almost $400 a month for insurance, it's denied?  Needless to say, I need to call the insurance company and pitch a fit.  I am totally not in the mood right now, so I'll wait an hour or so.   My 4 Doc package from Steph will not be here today per the UPS tracking info.  It didn't leave SC until a quarter of 4 this morning, and it's supposed to be delivered today.  UPS is pissing me off lately.   I'm not sure if I'm going anywhere today, but if I do it'll be over to the Chinese place for some pork in oyster sauce and a shrimp egg roll.  Yummy!   Later.

       Monday January 13, 2003   I'm at work right now, and so much don't want to be.  Only 4 hours left and I get to go home.  Nothing really going on to report.   Later.

       Sunday January 12, 2003   OK, after 41 minutes on the phone with HP support, I finally got my new digi cam to upload on my computer!  Woohoo!  So now I can take pictures and upload them at home.  I am too happy about this.   I cleaned Fluffy's room, and took a nap.  That would be the extent of my exciting day.     Later!

       Sunday January 12, 2003   Nothing interesting is going on today as I'm staying home.  I've tidied up my room and the rest of the apartment, but that's it.  Nothing else to report.   Byeeeeee!

       Saturday January 11, 2003   Yeah, I know it's technically Sunday but too bad...I didn't go to Detroit today as someone forgot to set his alarm (ass) for 6:30AM so we could get up and be at the show by 10AM.  I guess I'm going next Saturday, if I have to drive up there by myself.   Instead of going to Detroit today, I went to Beachwood Place and the Lodi Outlets.  I bought a shirt at Saks, some Urban Decay Lip Gunk (Big Bang) at Sephora and some socks at Nordstrom.  At the outlet mall, all I could find was one Levi's long sleeved T.  Depressing, yes?  Then I ventured to Barnes and Noble and picked up some useless stuff, and the latest issue of Lucky Magazine.  A quick trip to Marshall's for some more of that face scrub I got last weekend, and my day was complete.  I guess it is good that I didn't go to Detroit today as I've felt horrid all day long.  I can't wait to see what the CT Scan finds on Tuesday.   Public Service Announcement:  Take your Christmas decorations down (you know who you are)!  I understand that people work and stuff, but they obviously found the time to put the lights and decorations up, so they can find time to take them down as well.  At least don't turn the lights on if you're going to leave the shit up all year round.  Goodness.   I'm not doing a damn thing tomorrow, and I'm going to love every minute of it.   I'm off to further inspect my purchases.   NIghty!

       Friday January 10, 2003   My Mom and I went shopping last night for about 3 hours.  We got home, and Louie our landlord was just coming home as well.  He must have heard me say how lazy he is, because he offered to help us carry shit upstairs.  I smirked at him, then declined his offer, politely of course.  Lazy Bastard.   Whee, my camera still won't upload to my crappy home computer.  I may bust out the laptop to upload stuff, then transfer it to my desktop.  There's an idea...   I need to get to creating more LawnBunny stuff, and I need to figure out how to make the image "full bleed" on the items.  That way there won't be any white space on the item.   Gotta list some stuff, later.   Byeeeeeeeeee!

       Tuesday January 7, 2003   Well now, I have "chronic sinusitis".  I didn't have to see a doctor to figure that one out!  I have a CT scan of my sinuses on January 14; if I have a polyp I'll need surgery.  Won't that be fun?   I have to pick up my Mom at 9PM, so I should get to rustling around, I guess.   byeeeeeeeeee!

       Tuesday January 7, 2003   OK, here's the story so far on the LeBaron...  To actually FIX everything correctly, would be well over $1000!  The window reg can't be found used with a guarantee so that's $300 for a new one, then the rubber piece is $90 and that's without any labor.  My upper door hinge is fucked up and is welded on, so that's another 4 hours to get the damn door off to fix it, then it would have to be put back on and straightened up.  I need a new lock mechanism, and my actual lock cylinder fixed itself.  To have the bodywork on the passenger side completed would be $650 for the actual panel, then $700 to install and that doesn't include painting it.  My LeBaron needs to die a horrible, smoking death.  On the upside, I may be able to con my Mom into buying me a VW instead.   Off to make myself pretty.   Byeeeeeeee!

       Tuesday January 7, 2003   I didn't do anything last evening as I had the sinus headache from hell.  I go back to the doctor today at 5PM for yet another round of antibiotics.  Won't that be fun?   I have to get my car to the bodyshop today so the door and rear quarter window can be fixed.  Woohoo, I'll be able to use the driver side door again!  Double Woohoo!   Wolfie is going to design a logo for my webpage, and then I'm going to have some LawnBunny shirts and other shit for sale.  Don't everyone break their keyboards ordering my shit.  LOL   Four days until Boot Shop Day!  Oh, and the Auto Show.  : )~   Gotta take my car to the doctor now.  Byeeeeeeeee!

I need to buy another digi cam that will work with my crappy home computer, as I have some shoes I need to get pictures of.  Maybe that'll be my adventure for this evening.  Ah, I remember what I was going to do.  I need to make an appointment to get my door fixed, and to get my exhaust fixed.  Gonna do that now!   Byeeeeeeeeeee!

       Sunday January 5, 2003   I thought I was going to be slick and go to bed at 9PM.  As you can tell, that didn't work out.  I laid there for an hour, then got pissed and went to the bank.  Dammit!  I was on the phone and became so tired, then I hung up and was awake almost immediately.  Dammit again!   Less than a week until the Detroit Auto Show and my trip to Chester Boot!  I can't wait!   Fluffy just said hello.   I filed a Yahoo complaint against the ZIP Drive seller; lets see if that gets their ass moving.  Dicks.   OK, it's time to try and balance my checkbook.  Uck!   Byeeeeeeeee!

       Sunday January 5, 2003   I just shoveled the driveway as our landlords are too damn lazy to do anything.  I swear, if they were any more lazy they would be dead.  I don't have a problem shoveling the driveway, but it does piss me off that we pay them rent and they do absolutely nothing around here.  The only reason I did shovel is because I fell on my ass twice today, and I do not enjoy falling on my ass, especially in the damn snow!   I need to package up the boots I'm sending to Steph.  I'm trading her my gold hologram boots and my black and white 8 eyes, for a pair of gold glitter boots and a pair of, shit I can't remember!  Good, it'll be a surprise when they get here!   Off to take meds, my arthritis is acting up due to the shoveling incident.   Byeeeeeeee!

       Sunday January 5, 2003   Well the seller of the Yahoo Auctions items still refuses to sell them to me, therefore I posted negative feedback for them.  It's completely truthful, and deserved, negative feedback.  I hate liars, especially then they're trying to scam me out of money!   I bought 2 pairs of Nikes last night, an Abercombie and Fitch shirt (why, I have no idea) and some various other crap.  I also entered a transcation into my checkbook twice, so I have a lot more money than previously thought.  I swear, I should not be allowed near a checkbook register!   Gotta go sort laundry and clean stuff.  Byeeeeeee!

       Saturday January 4, 2003   OK, I didn't get to sleep until 2AM as the children downstairs were watching the Ohio State game with their friends.  Grown men acting as children over a stupid game.  Running around screaming and throwing things because Ohio State won.  GROW UP, IT'S JUST A GAME.   I feel a little better today, but I still don't feel 100%.  Maybe I'll buy some shoes today, and that'll make me feel better.  : )   Going grocery shopping, and I think my Mom and I are going to change the living room around.  We have to do something to block the damn breeze coming through the door to our balcony.  I need to throw something at someone.  Grrrrrrrr.   Gonna check the mail; I'm sure I didn't get anything.  Darn!   Later!

       Friday January 3, 2002   Well we didn't get that duplex in Plain Township either.  The fucker rented it out from under us.  He said that there was someone who looked at it the day before I did, and he rented it to them.  He somehow managed to forget this when I told him we had to have a place secured by today?  I repeat, fucker.  I will continue to be sick until it turns warm outside thanks to the shitty windows and doors in our current rat trap residence.  And the fact that the bitch downstairs doesn't keep the temperature contstant.  One day it's 80 degrees and the next it's not even 70.  Yes, I'm in a foul mood.   I ordered a Piping Hot pizza and a dozen wings.  I shall pick up my food, go home and grub down.  Then I will nap.   Bye.

       Thursday January 2, 2003   OK, apparently all that's wrong with Matt is a stitch came loose and it's causing icky stuff to leak into his system.  As soon as they repair that stitch he'll be OK again. Whew!   Crappy sellers piss me off.  The ZIP Drive finally arrived today, and it's not new as stated in the auction.  The Ferrari jacket is not as described, and the seller of some Yahoo Auctions stuff I won doesn't want to sell it to me now because I keep questioning the ever changing shipping charges, and the authenticity of the ring and necklace.  I emailed the seller prior to bidding in regard to the authenticity of the necklace, but I didn't receive a reply.  That somehow becomes my fault?  Damn, people need to get in touch with reality.  If you lie in auctions you will have pissed off bidders.  Lying=pissed off people.  It's not that hard!   I am so not wanting to go into work tomorrow.  I'm sure there will be all kinds of stupid emails from stupid people.  I need a break from eBay.   No word on the duplex in Plain Township, so obviously we didn't get that one either.  That means I'm stuck in this rat pit for 6 more months, lovely.  I'm so glad that person called to inform us earlier that we weren't getting the duplex.  I told them we had to have a place secured by Friday, or we were stuck in our current apartment for 6 more months.  Thanks a lot!   Byeeeeeeee!

Of couse, Blogger support hasn't replied to the email I sent them.  I love paying for something, having it not work and then not receiving any help on top of that!   Gotta go to PA to pick up my Mom.  Matt is worse so Julie left early this morning and left my Mom there by herself.     Byeeeeeeee.

      Friday February 28, 2003   OK, I am sincerely dead.  I hate to complain  because I know lots of people work a bunch of days in a row, but I'm apparently not built for it.  I worked 9 hours on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and today.  I worked 8 hours on Wednesday and I work 6 hours tomorrow.  Then I have to go to the museum on Sunday, and do 9 hours on Monday and Tuesday at my new job.  That's on top of driving 1 hour each way for 5 of the days, and tomorrow's commute will be 2 hours each way.  Seriously, someone needs to kill me now.   I bought some Kraft Green Box spaghetti.  I'm going to eat some then go to bed.   Nighty!

      Thursday February 27, 2003   Hmmmmmm, I could have sworn I posted something yesterday.  Anyway, the new guy at the museum already quit, so I guess I have two jobs now.  I told them I'd stick around to help out until they get someone new, but if they drag their heels on hiring someone else, they are on their own.  And I'm not helping them for free.  My new job is fine; I'm in Dover tomorrow and Steubenville on Saturday.  Then I get Sunday off, but will most likely spend it at the museum.  Yay!   The garage guy at my new job washed my car today, and fixed the vacuum hose that Montrose didn't replace.  They didn't replace it because IT'S NOT THERE!  Fucking Montrose!!!  He had to splice it from another line and fix it that way.  My Turbo kicks in and nearly throws me in the seat now.  It rocks.   OK, I'm off to bed.  I have to be up at 7AM in order to be at work by 9AM.   Nighty!

      Tuesday February 25, 2003   Sorry I didn't post anything yesterday.  I was so tired when I got home at 8PM that I was in bed by 9:30, and asleep by 10:15 (I was on the phone).  The drive into work yesterday was exciting to say the least.  I left here at 8:30AM and didn't get to Tallmadge until 10:15AM.  That drive usually would take me 40 minutes.  I slid all over the road, and didn't like a minute of it.  Thankfully the roads were fine on the way home at 7PM, so I drove about 75 to 80 the whole way.    : )~   The girl training me is really cool; I'm going to be bored out of my mind next week when I'm there by myself.  Ugh.  I seriously do not need 5 days of training!  I think I pretty much have the whole thing down already.     Tomorrow's my last day at the museum.   : (     The Quad sole apple/silvers came yesterday.  Holy crap, they kick ass!   OK, gotta get ready for work.  I see it snowed again, so my car is covered AGAIN.  At least the road is clear this morning.  Whew!   Byeeeeeeeeeeeee!

      Early Morning Saturday February 22, 2003   Didn't I have an interesting trip home?  Two cops followed me in their respective towns, and it was foggy as hell.  Actually driving in the fog doesn't bother me, but my windshield wipers must be bad as they don't clear the window; they smear the window.  Not good!   Got a lot of stuff to do today; Sunday will be my do nothing day.   Time for bed!   Nighty!   5 more days of museum employment~Wednesday is now my last day due to my new job.

Monday 10-7 Tuesday 9-6 Wednesday @ the Museum~Last Day 9-5 Thursday 9-5 Friday 9-5 Saturday 9-3 Sunday OFF! Ack, I'm going to be hella tired next week!   The ear, nose and throat doc seems to think I have polyps.  Apparently the CT Scan doesn't show polyps, cysts or inflammation; just infection.  He also wants to do an assload of allergy testing on me; won't that be fun?  Oh, how I love life.   OK, gonna go drive around Akron or something.   Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!

Now the Camper seller is trying to dick me around.  I'm about ready to tell him to shove it; that I'll proceed with the PayPal refund.  He sends me the wrong size then tries to make it out to be my fault.  What the fuck?   Gotta get ready for my doctor appointment.   One week of musuem employment.

      Thursday February 20, 2003   OK, so I don't have that job anymore.  Fuck you!!!!  (No, I'm not pissed, not pissed at all.)  I called that ass 14 times today, and left 4 messages.  I get the point that he's not going to give me the job, but still, he could have at least returned my calls to tell me in person.  He dicked me around for almost a month telling me I had the position, even going so far as to say I was going to start on Tuesday, then Wednesday due to the weather.  And now I don't have the job?  His reasoning is I should have found some way to get my drug test on Monday.  Excuse me for living in a place where the landlords are so fucking lazy they don't even mow their own lawn, let alone shovel snow (I refuse to shovel snow, especially the whole fucking driveway which they use as well.  That's why I pay rent.)  Excuse me for having a LeBaron that got stuck in the snow because it's so low to the ground.  Excuse me for not wanting to kill my car in order to take your precious fucking drug test.  I repeat, fuck you!!!!   On a much happier note, my Quad sole collection just added a new member today.  I'll get a pic of the newest addition when they arrive.  I took some better pics of some of my shoes; most of the newer pairs were photographed with my dying Polaroid cam.  My HP is so much more kickass!  I'll get those pics on my site tonight.   Seriously, fuck you!!   Going to Roadhouse tomorrow for dinner; I feel a bowl of French Onion soup coming into my near future.  I would like to hit West Point Market for dinner, but they don't have French Onion soup, so poopie head on them.     Oh Christ, the seller of my new Quads just emailed me the name of the site he bought them on.  Good lord, here we go.  LOL   NO SELF CONTROL AT ALL!!   I think I'm going to get a full refund on the Camper Scissors Twin shoes.  The guy sent me the wrong fucking size, again.  Grrrrrr!  At least he's offering to refund me, so it's not $65 down the drain.  I can pay for my new Quads and still come out on top!   Why have I started eating my tongue during the night.  It's all mangled and shit now.  Ugh!   It was hella warm today, and I was stuck the house waiting on Joe Don (not his real name; that's what I call the ass) to call.  I guess it's supposed to be warm tomorrow as well, so that's good!   I see the ear, nose and throat specialist tomorrow.  Since my CT Scan came out fine, I was referred to this dude to find out what's doing with my boogery nose.  I know, such an overshare.  I have to be there at 10AM, so I should be fine with the 7AM bladder wake-up call.  I'll set my alarm for 8:15 just in case.  Seriously, I wake up to pee every morning at 7AM on the dot!  Sometimes earlier, but most of the time 7AM on the dot.  Then the fucking kids scream, yell and thump so I can't go back to sleep.  Damn!   Nighty!

      Thursday February 20, 2003   Why do all people lie?  I have a stamper with a really cool quote by Mark Twain; "Those who tell the truth don't have to remember anything."  Fucking right on!  Everytime someone tells me something, they never follow through on it.  A job I had last Friday I suddenly don't have anymore.  What the fuck is up with that?  I know I passed my drug test with no problems, so I want to know what's going on.  They haven't actually said I don't have the job anymore, but I can feel that's where this is leading to.  Doug the temp place guy called last night and left me a message about JR the Pro-Car guy having some concerns about me, and how I was supposed to call Doug back.  So I did call him back as soon as I got the message, and he never returned my call.  I should have known better than to go to a fucking temp service in the first place.  I was supposed to work for the temp service for 45 days, then Pro-Car was going to hire me on.  If JR had concerns with me, they should have been addressed prior to offering me the job.  Hopefully the other position I was offered on Friday is still available, but I doubt it.   That's just one example of how people never follow through on anything.  I could go on, but do you really want me to?   Yes, I'm up at 8AM.  I woke up to pee at 7, and the fucking kids won't shut up.  I guess that means I'm up for the day.   8 more days of museum employment.

      Monday February 17, 2003   OK, I'm addicted to CSI Las Vegas, and Without A Trace.  Without A Trace features a very sexy guy by the name of Anthony LaPaglia, so that makes it even better.  His little brother Jonathan was Detective McNamara on New York Undercover; I loved that show too.  NYPD Blue with Jimmy Smits is still my all-time favorite though, and always will be.   I had fish sticks for dinner.  I haven't had fish sticks in at least 2 years; dammit they were good.   OK, I'm going to finish watching CSI Las Vegas, then go to bed.   Nighty!

      Monday February 17, 2003   OK, I got nothing done today.  I was on my way for my drug test, and got stuck in my fucking driveway.  Needless to say I was pretty pissed.  I missed the drug test, and work at the museum today.  Seriously, you've never seen more lazy people in your life.  Today Lousy Louie the landlord was off work due to the holiday, or maybe the snow, but in either event he was home all day.  Instead of shoveling the driveway, he went to play basketball.  My Mom always bitches because I tell her Angie's a crackhead, but really now.  She puts up with his stupid ass so I don't feel sorry for her at all.  Plus they are both as dumb as trees, so that doesn't help much.   I am most certainly not putting my Docs into their correct boxes; I'm throwing them into garbage bags and moving them that way.  I will correctly box them up at the new place, and store them in the basement.  I'm going to have so much more room; I won't know what to do with myself.   OK, it's off to the Post Office and the bank.   Byeeeeeeeeeeee!

      Monday February 17, 2003   OK, the snow needs to stop.  I can't even see the street in front of the house, and I need to have my drug test done for work.  I have until 4:30 to get there, but I'm also supposed to work at the museum today from 1-4.  I feel this way about the museum though.  I'm not driving in there and taking a chance on wrecking my car, especially since I have another job.  I'm pretty disenchanted with the museum, just in case you couldn't tell.  This has to due with how the employees are treated by the owner, and how they waited 2 weeks to finally interview people for my job.  Miss Lisa is not going in there 2 or 3 weeks into March just because they procrastinated and didn't get someone in there in time.  OK, now I'm finished bitching.   Bleh.  I don't think there will be any moving done for the next couple days.  Seriously, snow sucks ass.  I'm wearing ass high boots today to keep the snow away from my feetsies.   I just don't understand some people, and I'm leaving it at that.   Byeeeeeeeeeee!   11 more days of museum employment.

      Sunday February 16, 2003   Today is a do nothing day.  I love do nothing days.  I'm going to be very busy these next few weeks, so I'm taking all of the do nothing time I can.  I'll probably wind up packing stuff this afternoon, so it's not as if the whole day will be a waste.   I'm going to try and figure out my domain; I may transfer it to another server.  I really hate having my webpage look so crappy.   Do I really need over 200 pairs of Dr. Martens?  I'm trying to figure that out, and I think I'm going to come up with no as the answer.     OK, I'm off to do nothing for now.   12 more days of museum employment.

      Saturday February 15, 2003   OK, now why does this stuff always happen to me?  I had two job offers yesterday!  I start at Pro-Car on Tuesday.  My three locations are Stubenville, Dover and Tallmadge.  I train for a week, then I'm on my own.  Some person I faxed a resume to like 3 weeks ago finally decided to call me.  She called and offered me the job on the spot.  No interview or anything!  I swear, I'll go for 3 or 4 months with ultra shitty luck, then it breaks and I have the best luck!  The LeBaron is still shit, so that's a constant bad luck reminder.  : ) I'm still at the museum until February 28, so I'm going to be Miss BusyPants for the next couple weeks.   Kieth borrowed $50 more today, and used the BP card AGAIN!  Not even going to go there tonight; I'm in too good of a mood.   I bought a pair of white DM's yesterday.  They were only $10, so I  broke down and bought them.   Got some stuff packaged, but not much.  I need to get my ass going on the moving deal.   I've started uploading pics to my AOL webpage addy and that seems to be working.  Hopefully my lawnbunny domain will be straightened out soon as it looks like shit right now.   OK, I'm off to do something.  I've already vacuumed so I guess I'll chase the cat or make some bracelets.   Byeeeeeeeeeeeee!

      Friday February 14, 2003    HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!!   I've got a hot date with packaging tape, bubble wrap and boxes as I'm preparing for the move.  Woohoo!   I sold a couple more things on eBay today, and everything is paid for.  Well everything except some shoes, and that bidder is pissing me off.  Grrrrrrrr.   OK, I think I'm going to try sleeping.   Nighty!   14 more days of museum employment.

      Wednesday February 12, 2003   Yeah, not much to write about today.  I'm still pissed off because my homepage is all messed up, and I can't do anything to fix it.  I would transfer it to another service, but I'm too damn lazy.     Sprint PCS suddenly decided they would disconnect my phone this morning for non-payment.  Hello, I paid my bill last month just like usual, and haven't received my new bill.  I called, and sure enough, they hadn't posted my $46 payment for last month.  I bitched, and told the woman to check her records as the payment was deducted from my checking account one week ago.  She found the error, corrected it and restored my service immediately.  Damn skippy!   My interview went well this morning.  If I don't get the job it won't be due to a poor interview.  On a more positive note, I would be in Stubenville on Mondays from 10AM-7PM.  Not too bad considering I get paid for each hour I'm in the office, plus mileage to and from the location.  Pro-Car also pays for my lunch!  How kickass is that?!  I really hope I get that job...   My car is still overheating, and the dumb fucks "forgot" to hook up my vacuum hoses.  My car now makes a really loud sound all the time, and my heater only works on the window defrost setting.  Nice.  Excuse me for being so insanely pissed right now that I can't even talk about it.   On to better things...I've starting packing shit for the move and will have a bunch of stuff in there by Sunday.  I hope to be totally moved in by the end of the month.  If my Mom isn't, well that's just too bad.  Speaking of her, she suddenly decided that she's getting rid of the BP account we've had for 8 or 9 years (back when it was still Sohio).  She was bitching because she has sent them over $400 in two months.  Sorry, but only $162 of that was mine and I paid for it (the turbo sucks up gas like you wouldn't believe, and I like to drive...a lot).  Perhaps if she didn't put gas in Kieth's van 2-3 times a week at over $20 a pop the gas card bill wouldn't be so high.  I currently have the only BP card for that account, and I plan on keeping it that way.  I pay for my shit, therefore I'm going to continue using it.  Thank you for reading that useless rant...   Vanilla Coke makes me burp...a lot!   I planned on being asleep by 12:30 tonight, but what do I do?  Fall asleep during Knight Rider at 5:30PM and nap until 7PM.  And now I'm drinking Vanilla Coke right before going to bed.  Knight Rider wasn't that bad tonight, it's just that I have that episode (Goliath) on VHS.  Yes, I am a member of the Columbia House Knight Rider VHS club.  I love Knight Rider!   OK, I'm off to see if I can at least change my shoe photo on my webpage.   Nighty!   16 more days of museum employment.

      Tuesday February 11, 2003   OK, domains.com is not on the up and up.  Supposedly I was exceeding my domain quota, and that's why I couldn't update my page.  So I deleted 15 files, and domains.com gave me 5MB more space.  I still can't update my page.  Figure that one out!   On a happier note, I drove my car home last night, and wouldn't you know it, the temp gauge started going up.  Woohoo!  I love Chryslers, and more specifically, I love Montrose Chrysler Plymouth in Louisville, Ohio.   I'm picking the keys up to our new duplex this morning!  I'll start dribbling stuff over this evening.     It's off to work!   Yes, I'm wearing the hell out of those B/W Mary Janes!   17 more days of museum employment.   Byeeeeeee!

      Monday February 10, 2003   OK, the owner of Montrose called me back and said it is a blown head gasket.  Like I didn't already know that!  Anyway, he told me the car would be finished today, and that I'm supposed to call him in a couple days to let him know how things are.  It was nice to finally be treated respectfully by someone at Montrose.  About 30 minutes later my cell rings again and it's Roger from the Louisville Montrose.  He was so nice to me I could have puked.  He told me it is the head gasket, and my car is finished.  He also said that all of the overheating caused the gasket to go.  Ya think?  What a crackpot.  So I'm picking my car up this evening, and hopefully it'll behave itself for a few months at least.   I received my blue patent boots today!  They kick ass.   My LawnBunny page has been down for a while.  Every time I try to update it, the page doesn't save.  And my Blog is fucking up too.  My shoe for the day picture isn't showing up, nor are my archives.  Hmmmmmmmmmmm.  The Internet is our friend!   My dear, you have the intelligence of a tree stump.  Stop while you're ahead.

      Monday February 10, 2003   Well, today has been constructive so far.  I've called AAA and the owner of the Montrose Auto Group regarding my treatment at Montrose in Louisville.  AAA is going to take down the AAA approved sign at Montrose, and the owner was supposedly calling them to have a little chat.  Clarke Chrysler in Cuyahoga Falls confirmed that it's a bad head or head gasket, so that kicks ass too.  I can't go into work today as I have no car, and my Mom needs hers.  This really sucks.  If I don't hear from someone by 2PM regarding a loaner, I'm going to start calling people again.  I'm an ass.   No mail yet; I should get some packages today, though.  Woohoo!   Byeeeeeeeee!

      Sunday February 9, 2003   Wheeeeee, I get to have my blood drawn tomorrow morning at 8:30AM.  On a day that I don't have to be at work until 1PM; what was I thinking?  Oh well, at least that'll get me started early to bitch at Montrose.    : )~   Miss Steph is having fits over the negative feedback she received.  Some bitch from Canada didn't purchase insurance, then the customs folks lost one of the boots.  She tried to get Steph to refund the money, but Steph held her ground and refused!  Woohoo!  Steph's as anal about her feedback as I am, so the negative upsets her and rightfully so.  She's afraid people won't bid on her shit because of it.  Check out her auctions!  Her eBay ID is CalypsoFlamingo   OK, I'm off to bed.   Nighty!

      Sunday February 9, 2003   Sorry I haven't updated my blog.  I've been ultra busy with all kinds of shit.  Below is a brief description...   Friday I went to Akron and that's about it.  Did some shopping, and received a kick ass pair of DM's in the mail.  Black and white Mary Janes with two straps.  Cute!   Yesterday was quite the adventure.  I went to Akron again, and my car overheated AGAIN.  This time the coolant was white and foamy which indicates a cracked head.  It's the exact same thing that happened the first time.  My car was towed again last night, and is now over at Montrose, again.  I am demanding a loaner car this time, and won't stop bitching until I get what I want.  This is the 4th time it's been in for overheating in 2 months.  I'm finished on that subject.  LOL   The best news of all!  WE ARE MOVING!  We just rented a duplex today!  It's red brick with pillars in the front, I love pillars!  There's a full, dry basement then the main floor with kitchen, dining room and living room, then two big bedrooms upstairs and the full bath.  There's no garage, but that's OK.  There are washer/dryer hookups!  We can start moving in immediately, and plan on being in totally by March 14th!  WOOHOO!  It's still in Louisville, so that's good too.   I'm off to package stuff and to photograph stuff as well.  My webpage isn't working properly.  I can't update anything on the page, and I'm not really sure why.  I've contacted the server people, but I'm sure they won't do shit about it.  I'll have it updated just as soon as I can.   Byeeeeeeee!

      Wednesday February 5, 2003   OK, I finally broke down and did laundry.  That could have been because I had no clean jeans for work tomorrow.  : )   How I wish we had washer/dryer hookups at this crappy apartment.  Ack!   I'm sneezing my head off, but at least my head is more clear and I don't have a headache.   I'm still puffy, steroidal Lisa though.  Oh well.   OK, off to put away my clean clothes and to chase Fluffy.   Byeeeeeeeee!

      Wednesday January 5, 2003   Taco Bell no longer has 7 layer nachos.  Fuckers!   Finally the heat in my room is working.  I guess a valve downstairs blew out or something, which would explain why she had the plumber guy come sooooooo fast to fix it.  She's a pinhead, and I hope to be out of here within a couple months.   I got my La Perla frames today.  They are awesome!   I have to pickup my car this afternoon, and wash some clothes.  I'm also gonna list a shitload of Docs on eBay.  What do I need with shoes I can't wear?   OK, I'm off to eat some bacon.   Byeeeeeee!   23 more days of museum employment.

      Tuesday February 4, 2003   I didn't do much of anything today.  My car is dead due to another sticking thermostat, or so Montrose claims.  I can pick the car up anytime tomorrow.  You know I'm going to run the piss out of it and make sure it overheats prior to the weekend.  Asses.   I'm currently watching MST3K, and being lonely.   Nighty.

      Monday February 3, 2003   Ack, my checking account is all screwy.  The check I deposited on Friday still hasn't posted, and California Car Cover took that money out ($80) without my authorization.  Argh!  I hate banks.   It was hella warm today; and it's even warmer now that it's evening!  45 degrees the first week of February!  Woohoo!   My arms and face are both puffy today.  I thought I was going to escape the steroidal puffiness, but obviously it has caught up to me.  Oh well, only 3 more days of 'roids, then I'm finished with them.   My car is still in the shop, and Montrose didn't bother calling me back today with the diagnosis.  Asses.  I called Chrysler and complained, but of course it's not going to do any good.  The lady I spoke with was very nice though, so that kinda made up for it.   Some chick came into the museum today to interview for my job.  She seemed OK, but not very likely to work out at the museum.  I know snap judgements are bad, but she seemed like an "Oh my God there's dirt, eeeew" kinda girl.  Not a good mentality when working around dirty car parts, and dirty men.  LOL   Fluffy got on the counter today and I kicked his ass.   Our landlord is a pinhead, but that goes without saying.   I think I'm finished babbling.   Byeeeeeeee!

      Sunday February 2, 2003   OK, I can't do laundry today.  I deposited a check on Friday evening, and only $50 was available immediately.  I won't be able to access the rest until tomorrow evening or Tuesday afternoon.  I did get all of my laundry sorted though, and that's half the battle.  I have 10 bags of laundry to wash, dry, fold, put away and lug up and down 16 stairs.  Any volunteers?   The Docs organization isn't coming along as planned.  I have way too many shoes!   I found my Danzig tape, and a Testment tape.  Woohoo!   OK, I'm off to get a drink then get back to the Docs.   Byeeeeeee!

Now if I could just get them straightened up in the real world, I'd be deliriously happy!   I'm off to call Chrysler regarding my claim.  I'm gonna get Montrose in trouble....LOL   Byeeeeeee!

      Sunday February 2, 2003~Early Morning   OK, I can see I'll be up until 6 or 7AM again today.  I guess I'm supposed to take the steroids in the early morning to prevent being up all night.  It's good to read the patient leaflet prior to beginning the medication.  Duh!   I rearranged the living room today and it looks much more spacious.  I sincerely need to get some kind of organization going on with my Docs.  They are totally scattered about in my room, and it looks really crappy.  I also need to do laundry and continue doing laundry once a week.  That would greatly cut down on the bedroom clutter as I wouldn't have about 8 bags of laundry sitting in the corner.  Ack!   Wal-Mart has large-ish Care Bears for $5.88.  I'm pondering buying one of each for my collection.  I currently have 4 of the smaller beanbag butt Care Bears.  They're so cute!   Ooooooh, the new issue of Lucky should be out!  Woohoo!   OK, off to ramble about.   26 more days of museum employment.   Nighty!

      Saturday February 1, 2003   OK, why was I up until 6 this morning?  Steroids, that's why!  But I feel better so that's all that matters.   I made a pair of shoes last night; they are my shoes for the day.  I am a dork.   I'm trying to track down $80.95 that's missing out of my checking account, and I think I've found where it went.  Grrrrrrrr!  I love when companies take money out of my account without my permission.  I'm going to have some words with California Car Cover pretty damn soon.   I have no car all weekend, and it's not fun.  I'm sure Montrose will take as long as humanly possible to "fix" my car.  Once again, Chryslers are evil.   27 more days of museum employement.

      Sunday March 30, 2003   I just slammed down my 5th SoBe Green Tea in less than an hour.  Can we say addict??   I rearranged my room and finished my laundry.  I also gathered up all of the paperwork for my car suit.  I noticed something very funny-odd.  Montrose doesn't have overheating as one of the issues on the first work order, nor do they have the fact that they replaces the lifters and that the engine was cutting out under heavy acceleration.  Strange, yes??  I have a feeling I'm going to go round and round with Montrose for quite a bit longer.  Woohoo!  I can't fucking wait...   I have Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday off this week!  Heather and her Mom are going to a day spa, so she needed me to switch with her.  She's working Wednesday for me and I'm working Friday for her.  Kickass!!  I'll have to work Friday and Saturday both, but I'm sure I can live.     I forgot to mention the fun I had on Wednesday!!  I got to drive a silver 5-speed Beetle!!  Since my car is hella crappy, Dan let me drive the Beetle to pick up lunch.  It is soooooo cute, but I'd still rather have a GTI or Golf.  I most certainly feel a VW in my near future.   Bleh!!   Nighty!

      Sunday March 30, 2003   Finally, I'm getting my laundry finished up!!  Only about 5 more loads and everything, including comforters and sheets, will be clean!!  We still don't have a dryer, so my basement currently looks like a department store minus fixtures.  I could give a rats' ass though, at least my laundry will be finished.  I messed around with it as my Mom was supposed to buy a dryer and still hasn't.  She probably "loaned" the money to Kieth...   I plan on calling Montrose tomorrow with the compression test results.  I'm sure they won't do anything to repair the engine, so I'll go forward with my suit against them.  I'm not a suing kind of gal, but I feel that's the only way I'm going to get the engine problem corrected properly.  All I want is a new engine that runs as a new engine should (no knocking, overheating, choppy idle or major oil consumption).  Is that asking too much?   Willie's Muffler is the pimp daddy of exhaust places.  My muffler tip is all pimped to one side and shit.  My car is so quiet now!!   I'm in Steubenville tomorrow; fun times.  I'd better get used to it though as it'll be my home for two months.  Here's the hours I'll be keeping those two months, just in case anyone cares (includes travel time and getting ready time in the morning):  Mondays~7AM-9PM  Tuesdays~6AM-8PM  Wednesdays~6AM-8PM  Thursdays~6AM-8PM  Fridays~6AM-8PM  Saturdays~OFF  Sundays~OFF   I'm going to make hella good money, but I'll be too damn tired to enjoy it!!  That's good though, maybe I'll be able to save money.  What I'll probably wind up doing is taking two weeks pay to buy a 95 or so VW.  Rock out!!  If I could find a VW Corrado or Scirocco I'd be even more excited, and since they haven't made either model for a while, I may get off cheaper too!!  We'll see when the time comes.   Queensryche, Dream Theater and Fates Warning may be touring together very soon.  How happy will I be??  I can't wait until they come to the Cleveland/Toledo/Pittsburgh area.  I'm so there!!   Ministry is at the Cleveland Odeon April 26; see you there!!   The Henry Rollins show on March 27 rocked out, but then Hank always is awesome.   It's snowing today.  It's supposed to snow until Wednesday I believe, then get back up into the 60's.  I hate Ohio!   I'm dizzy and feel like I'm going to fall over.     Time to package stuff and tidy up my room.   Later!

      Saturday March 29, 2003   Sorry for the nonposts; been busy.   Starting mid-April I'll be working in Steubenville Monday-Friday.  Keisha is going on maternity leave, so I'm filling in for her until mid-June.  Won't that be fun??   My car has a bad cylinder!!  Woohoo!  I had a compression test done yesterday, and it's 125 for 3 cylinders then 80 for the last one.  I repeat, woohoo!!   Going to bed.   Nighty!!

It was warm today so I drove around with the top down.     Went to the allergy doctor today for my first round of tests.  So far, I know I'm allergic to trout, brazil nuts, turkey, chocolate, blueberries and cranberries and have slight allergies to corn, green peppers and something else.  Doesn't that just about suck?  I go in next Thursday for my second round of allergy test.  I'll post a list when I'm all finished!   Sold some crap on eBay; life is good.   Went to Gabe's and spent money for no reason.  Boredom is death to my checking and PayPal accounts.   Going to bed; work in Tallmadge tomorrow.   Nighty!

      Sunday March 23, 2003   I rescued some Docs from the basement today; thankfully the basement flood didn't ruin them.  My room is starting to look neat, but I still need to find somewhere to put all of my watches and cosmetics.  I feel a trip to Pier 1 or Bed, Bath and Beyond in my near future.   OK, I have to go do something.  I forgot what it was, but I'm sure I'll remember eventually.   Byeeeeeeeee!

I don't know why that amused me, but it did.   I will have my room perfected by this evening.  I'm tired of wearing the same 4 pairs of Docs, and the same damn watch!!   OK, more later.

      Friday March 21, 2003   OK, I got my hair colored today and it rocks out!!  I'll post a pic soon.  I'm now a redhead, but it's more purple than red.  Hard to explain...   My computer chair is broken, so I fall out of the chair at least once daily.  I'm going to have to break down and buy a new one as I don't enjoy falling on my ass.   I finally fixed my brake lights!  In the process I broke my turn signal housing, but I fixed it with electrical tape.  I rock out!  I am the mechanic genius; OK maybe not.   I really should see what the hell my Mom is doing downstairs.  She's banging on stuff with a hammer, never a good sign.   I need to do more laundry and finally buy a dryer.  I waste so much time everyday on doing nothing; I should have a dryer by now.   Tomorrow is Dover day.     I'm going to see Hank Rollins in Toledo on Thursday; it will be too cool to see his performance again.   OK, that's all for now.   Byeeeeeeeee!

      Thursday March 20, 2003   I wound up falling asleep last night at 7PM, and just woke up!  Obviously I was tired...   It's cold out today.  Of course, on my day off it'll be cold and icky.  I have a ton of running around to do today; why couldn't it be warm and sunny?     I have to pick up my keys at Montrose, pick up my check, deposit said check, get the rest of my crap at the museum and make appointements for about 15 Doctor things.  Whee.   OK, I'm done for now.   Byeeeeeeeee!

      Tuesday March 18, 2003   I am currently amused at the disrespect and non-appreciation some people show me.  After all of the shit I put up with for almost a year, that's how I'm repaid.  I take it as slander, but maybe I read too much into stuff.  Suffice it to say, I won't be offering up anymore help.   On to better things...Montrose claims there's nothing wrong with my car.  Seriously, I'm close to driving through the front of the building.  Grrrrrrrr...   OK, I have to hang up clothes, then it's off to bed for Lisa.   Nighty!

      Tuesday March 18, 2003   Some may think it's tacky to write about family stuff, but I believe everyone needs to know what shit I have to put up with.  It explains my irritability if nothing else, and I'm hoping to shame certain family members into paying back what they owe.  Obviously the need to do the right thing isn't working, so maybe shame will!!

      Tuesday March 18, 2003   I like having Tuesdays off now.  Steubenville kicks my ass every week.  Yesterday I left at 5:30 as I was yakking. Nice, huh?  Everytime I work in Steubenville I'm headachy, and red faced.  I dunno what it is about that place; Matt said it's the river which is probably correct.  LOL   My car is back at Montrose for the 70 millionth time.  It's overheating again, nice huh?  The first warm day and it starts that shit up again.  I called the owner of Montrose again, but I'm sure he won't call me back, AGAIN.    PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: DO NOT BUY/LEASE/SERVICE ANY VEHICLE AT THE MONTROSE AUTO GROUP!!!!     I'm stuck at home all day as I don't have a car to drive.  If I haven't heard anything by 4PM I'm calling Montrose as I will need a loaner car for tomorrow.  Fuck them and their shitty service.   Steph's online so I'm gonna talk to her now.   Byeeeeeeeeeee!

       Sunday March 16, 2003   I'm addicted to SoBe Green Tea in the cardboard containers.  It's hella good!  I'm going through at least an 8 pack a day.  Nice, huh?   It was 70 degrees here today!!  You know I took a pointless drive with the top down.  It's supposed to be warm the whole week; I'm so happy!   I now have the computer in my room.  It actually looks nice, and fits well at the end of my bed.  Now I need to buy a dryer tomorrow because my Mom obviously isn't bothered by not having one.  Jeff got the wrong kind of dryer cord; he bought a 50 AMP range cord for a 30 AMP dryer.  It wound up killing the dryer.  Grrrrrrrrr.  I wasn't home, I was at work, or I would have purchased the correct one.  Moron.   I love doing laundry in my own basement.  Woohoo!   I guess the people next door are kind of icky.  They have a mentally retarded kid and they're trying to get him on SSI even though he's able to function in society.  That's so sick when adults try to use their disabled children to get more money.  Get a damn job!!   Our other immediate neighboors are fine; we never hear or see them.  The people two doors down are really nice, and the guy on the very end is an ass, and an alcoholic.  He keeps to himself though, so that's OK.  I waved to him and said hi when we first moved in and didn't receive any type of reply.  He may kindly fuck off.  The people on the other end of the building are my age, and the girl is a ghetto rat.  The guy seems OK, but I'm in no big hurry to become friendly with either one of them.  I pretty much keep to myself.   OK, I have to finish putting crap away so my room isn't in shambles when I go to bed tonight.  I hate waking up to a messy room!   Byeeeeeeeeeeeee!

      Sunday March 16, 2003   All of the stuff is finally out of the old apartment; I'm going to have to listen to her bitching for at least another week.  I moved all of my stuff last time we moved; no help from anyone except with my bed, cedar chest and bookcase.  I carried everything else.  So, I left most of my shit in my room and let Jeff and Kieth carry it all.  They owe over $10,000 to my Mom with no repayment in sight, so they can help carry my shit.   Bought some new shoes last night; they're on my homepage.   Going to scrounge up some food.   Byeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!

      Friday March 14, 2003   JR changed my work schedule again!  It actually works out better, though.  Mondays I'm in Steubenville, Wednesdays I'm in Akron and Saturdays I'm in Dover.  Now I don't have to work the day after Steubenville.  Woohoo!  Steubenville always kicks my ass as I have to get up at 7AM and don't get home until 9PM.  It'll be nice to be off the day after.   Getting paid every week is my friend.  I thought it would be bad, but I actually save money more easily knowing I'll have more the next week.  I'm strange, I know.   I subscribed to AudBlog so I'll have 12 audio posts a month.  Everyone jump for joy!   The DSL service at home is finally working again.  Woohoo!   I put my dresser thingie together wrong.  I get to tear it apart and re-do it this afternoon. Woohoo!   OK, I'm off.  Byeeeeeeeeeee!

      Thursday March 13, 2003   I can finally do a real post!  It's been so hectic with work and getting stuff arranged that I haven't had time to update anything, or email anyone.  OK, here's the lowdown...   Nothing is going on other than work!!!!  I'm going to have pizza for lunch.   Byeeeeeeeeeeee!

      Sunday March 9, 2003   Woohoo, I did laundry in my own basement!  I know, the smallest things excite me.  I did 5 loads and the dryer decided it was tired.  It kicked the breaker, so I guess I'm done until tomorrow when I get home from Steubenville.  That's OK, at least I have clean work clothes and clean bed linens.   I finally got pics of my new Docs.  I think that's all of the new ones; I'll do an inventory later in the week.  Our dry basement is leaking, and some of my cloth Docs got wet.  I've figured out that all landlords lie, or at least all that I've encountered lie.  Nice, huh?   I'm off to post my shoe pics, then make some green box spaghetti.   Byeeeeeeeeee!

      Saturday March 8, 2003   Today has been a good day.  Work was easy and both drawers balanced.  The weather was warm, and I moved most of my crap from the old apartment.  I finally got the computer hooked up, woohoo!  It's currently on the dining room table, but I think it's going to wind up in my room.  I would put it in the basement, but I'm afraid it would leak just where the computer is.  Call me paranoid, but I know how my luck is.     I drove over to the old apartment with the top down; oh yes I did.     I think Piping Hot sounds good for dinner.   Christina Aguilera is a dirty whore, and I mean that in a bad way.  Oh, and someone needs to remind her that she's white.   I'm off tomorrow, woohoo!  I enjoy three days off during the week very much so.  Saturdays I only work until 3, so that's pretty cool too.   I have an assload of crap to put away, and I plan on posting some shoe pictures on my bunny site too.  Busy doing nothing.   Byeeeeeeeeee!

      Friday March 7, 2003   OK, I know it's been a week since I updated this bad boy.  Sorry.  I worked 8 days in a row and wanted to die.  The phone still isn't hooked up at our new duplex, and won't be until tomorrow.  The people who lived there prior didn't have their crappy MCI phone service disconnected, therefore SBC wouldn't hook our phone up until the MCI shit was turned off.  So anyone who calls our number will receive a "phone is disconnected" message until tomorrow.  Sooooo embarassing...   I bought 4-5 new pairs of Docs and will have them posted soon.     The Cleveland Auto Show was pretty cool; there was hardly anyone there at 3PM.  Woohoo!   I had Boston Market for dinner and am stuffed.  Gotta hit Wal-Mart for some face cleanser.  Biore is pretty good shit!   OK, I'm done.   Byeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

      Saturday March 1, 2003   OK, if only everyone could see my right now.  I'm sitting on the floor on a bag of dirty clothes typing this.  I came home from work today and the apartment is pretty much empty.  Nice.  No couch, chairs, table or any of that good stuff.  Luckily they didn't fuck with my bed or I'd have had to piss with someone.  I drove 1.5 hours each way to work today, and was not in the mood for that shit tonight.  Needless to say I'm pretty grumpy right now.   Staying home tonight even though Jodi's hubby's band is playing at Annabell's tonight.  I feel bad about not going, but I'd probably fall asleep and die during the drive up there.  Not good.   Steubenville may suck my ass.  It's in the middle of nowhere and it's just icky.  Yuck.   I guess I'll be moved into the new place tomorrow.  Whee.   OK, going to do something other than type on the computer.   Byeeeeeeeeee!

      Saturday March 1, 2003   Happy March 1st!!!   OK, who called my house at 2:45 this morning?  Seriously, I wouldn't care any other time, but I had to be up at 6AM today.  Someone needs to learn some manners!   The sun isn't even up yet; this is not natural.  Steubenville is about 2 hours from me, and I'm only working 5 hours today.  Nice.   Need to shower then go to work.   Byeeeeeeee!

      Wednesday April 30, 2003   By the way, I had a phantom dent appear in my car Monday night.  I went outside yesterday morning, and had problems opening the door.  Upon looking down, I noticed this  urlLink fucking dent   in my car!  I filed a claim today with the insurance company, and I'm having the estimates done on Saturday.  Nice, huh??  Oh well, I don't plan on driving the piece of shit much longer, so maybe it's trying to implode into itself.  That would rock out!!!!   OK, nighty!!!

Oh well, I haven't talked to him in a long while, so I'll allow myself a few more minutes.    Work is evil, but at least tomorrow is payday again.  Woohoo!   Byeeeeeeee!

      Tuesday April 29, 2003   Yay, I took today off!  Actually I took today off because I felt like crap yesterday, and I called the Doc today.  I thought it was sinus funkiness when it was really allergies.  I can't take any allergy stuff until my tests are finished, and since I missed Saturday's test, I have to suffer until the second week of June.  Ack!   I found a 98 Beetle for $8999!!!  I must go look at it on Saturday, and hopefully it's not gone by then.  Wish me luck!!   Montrose should be getting a call pretty soon regarding my car.  The warranty claims manager from Chrysler is calling them to inform them that my car is to be fixed, and fixed correctly.  That'll teach them to fuck with me!!   I may be receiving the new Type O CD sometime this week.  It's not due out until June 17th, so that would very much rock.   I made Ice Blue Lemonade Kool Aid and it's hella good.  I haven't had Kool Aid in years; I had forgotten how tasty it is.   I introduced Matt to the world of Ben and Jerry's on Monday.  He wanted ice cream with chocolate and nuts.  I went to Kroger's and found him New York Chunk.  He was delirously happy with it, and told everyone he could think of all about the ice cream.  He then proceeded to eat the entire container at one sitting.  While he and I were eating our ice cream, Dave and Paul decided to have a water balloon fight in the store.  Dave's junk was all wet and he got Paul's back soaked.  So there those two were running around outside on the lot trying to dump water on each other.  Nice, yes???  See what happens when we get bored?  Bad things happen when we get bored!!   Some people make me feel bad for being mad at them.  It sucks to care about people!!!   OK, gotta go.  My nose is running, and it's time for bed.   Byeeeeeee!

      Sunday April 26, 2003   Whee, I've been so lazy about updating this thing.  Anyway, here's a recap of last week...   Car died on me a total of 15 times on the way to work last week.  12 of those times were on Friday, nice huh?  Bleh, I say, bleh.  It is evil and I hate it.   Missed Jenny's tattoo party today due to the evil LeBaron.  I will drive out to see Jenny next Sunday because I would like to see her!  Fucking American cars...   I got a new cell phone yesterday, woohoo!  Here's the  urlLink link   for it.  It's a PCS Vision phone with all kinds of cool features.  I've already downloaded the Knight Rider Theme and the Exorcist Theme for ringtones.  Woohoo!   Today was a very nice day.  I believe I may have got a little sunburn on my face.  Color in the face is good.  It'll hide the red blotches I get from eating chocolate (and shrimp, and lobster...you get the picture).     I highly recommend Aveda's Sap Moss shampoo and conditioner.  It doesn't smell the best, but it's some hella good shit.   Queensryche and Dream Theater update!  I'm so at the Detroit, Cleveland and Columbus shows.  I can't wait!  I'm finally going to see both bands in concert, and at the same time.  Too nifty.  And tickets are only $35.50, which I don't think is a bad price at all.   The new Fleetwood Mac CD is kickass.  Buy a copy today!!   A fucking month.  That's all I have to say.  Some people seriously make me mad, and worried at the same time.  Not a fun way to be.   My new glasses are hella cool and I very much like them.   I forgot my allergy test on Saturday.  I'm going to reschedule as soon as I can.  I'm such an ass.   Tomorrow is a 10-7 workday.  I must set my clock for 7:30AM instead of 6AM.  Duh!   New tattoo on Saturday!!!!   OK, I've babbled enough.   Nighty!

They are willing to settle for $3500!  I can't believe it!!   I am ass tired, and pissed off at certain people.  Seriously now, three fucking weeks?  Goodness.   OK, off to work.

      Tuesday April 15, 2003 Congratulations Matt On Passing Your Motorcycle License Test!   OK, nothing happened today.  That's good, but it's also bad.  I didn't get another speeding ticket on the way home, but it wasn't due to a lack of trying.  Dropping my average speed from 85 to 70 has added 10 minutes to my commute.  OK, most of you are probably rolling your eyes right now, but when you're driving 200 miles a day for work, 10 minutes suddenly becomes a very big deal.  Only 6.5 more weeks to go!   Sold some shit on eBay, yay me!   I'm looking very forward to picking up my new glasses on Saturday.   I have my final allergy test on April 26.  So far I'm allergic to way too many of my favorite things.  Dammit!   Alright, I'm going to bed.   Nighty!

      Sunday April 13, 2003 Happy 27th Birthday Dr. Dork!   Whee, I love doing laundry in my own basement.  Seriously, you don't realize how handy it is until you can't do it anymore.   Tomorrow is the beginning of week 2 Steubenville working time.  I'll get my first big pay next Thursday.  This Thursday's pay will be one day short.  I plan on picking up my new glasses ($188 damn dollars) and buying a DVD player.  I guess I shouldn't bitch too much about my glasses though, as the ones I currently have on my face were over $400.  I'm having the lenses tinted so I will actually have a pair of sunglasses!  Whee!  That reminds me, I need to get lenses for my new LaPerla frames.  I suck.  I may buy a new cell phone too, as my battery dies after about 20 minutes of talking.  I'm lusting over the Sprint PCS Vision phones with the built in camers.  However, I WILL save lots of this money!!!  Yes I will!!   It's supposed to be nice and warm all week.  Finally!   Nothing else is going on, and I am going to bed.   Nighty!

      Friday April 11, 2003   Working this much is killing Lisa.  I know, it's only my third day in a row.  I'm already dead.  Thankfully I don't have to get up until 8AM on Monday and Thursday as I start at 10AM and can make it there in 1.5 hours.  I rock.   I'm burning a CD for Dave fromp; it better not make me late this morning or I'll kick his ass Monday.   Matt better ride his Harley to work today; he owes me a ride for putting up with his dumb ass.   Nothing has went on; I've been working then coming home and going to bed.  Hella exciting, yes?

      Tuesday April 8, 2003   Yeah, Tuesdays' post is on Wednesday morning.  Piss off.   Went to the allergy doctor today.  It turns out I'm allergic to Fluffy.  Nice, huh?   I start 5 days a week tomorrow, Wednesday.  Someone please kill me.   On the upside of things, I was approved for a new VW!!  I don't think I'm going to buy a brand new one though, as I don't want to spend $350 a month on a car payment.  I think a $12,000 VW would suffice, so I'll most likely get a 98 or 99 VW.  It will be red, black or yellow with 2 doors (not 4) and a sunroof.  It will also be a 5-speed.  I'll most likely get a GTI, but I may buy a Beetle.  I'm not sure yet.   OK, Lisa needs to go to bed.  Get up time is 6AM.  Ack!!   Nighty!!

      Sunday April 6, 2003   I didn't realize I hadn't updated this thing all weekend.  I suck.   Got the dryer delivered and it turns out the dumbfuck landlord has a 50 amp range outlet in the basement instead of a 30 amp dryer outlet.  That's why the old dryer burned up.  The delivery guys wouldn't hook up the new dryer with the incorrect outlet, so my Mom called the landlord.  He said he's not going to pay to have the outlet replaced; we have to.  Needless to say I'm not happy about that, but at least we'll have a dryer.  The electrician is coming tomorrow to replace the outlet.     SBC Yahoo DSL is pretty cool, but it'd be nice if my email would work, and if I could create sub-accounts.  It took me 4 hours to install it last night; it should have only taken me 1.  I've had to call tech support 4 times in less than a day, nice huh?  Oh well, I'll get it all fixed Tuesday.   I take my car to the Steubenville Chrysler dealer tomorrow.  He's going to thoroughly go over it and see what's doin.  Woohoo!   To the right, you'll see I've added a link to my Yahoo calendar.  If you care, you can see what I have planned on any given day.  Have fun!   Going to bed.   Nighty!

I'm going shelf shopping tomorrow.  Woohoo!   It was warm out today, and I enjoyed it.  That's about all that went on.   Byeeeeeeee!

      Happy April Fools' Day!! Tuesday April 1, 2003   I can't believe it's the first day of April!!  Thankfully the temps were in the 60's today, and are supposed to be over 70 tomorrow.  Woohoo!   My attorney called today; we are going forward with my suit against Montrose. Actually, I guess the suit is against MOPAR and not Montrose which would explain why Montrose didn't give a fuck about me, or my car problems.  I should expect a settlement offer within 2-3 weeks of between $1,000 and $3,000.  Since the engine alone was just under $3,200 I would hope it's a settlement offer of $3,000.  If it's anything over $2,500 I'm buying a VW!!  I won't get my hopes up though, as I know how my luck is.  I'll most likely wind up getting $500.   Went to the opthomologist today;yes I'm a blind dork.  My eyes changed, yet we couldn't find a prescription to clear things up.  I have to go back in 6 months as the doc was concerned about something and wants "to closely monitor the situation".  Nice.   I ordered the network interface card for my SBC/Yahoo DSL service.  The service will be active tomorrow, but I can't use it until I get the card which is supposed to arrive Friday.  Actually the card was supposed to be included with my modem, but it wasn't for some reason.  I love not having an ethernet thingie already in my computer.  It is nice that my USB port will be freed up for my camera.  No more crawling around the back of the computer everytime I want to upload pics.   Tomorrow I'm not doing anything, and Thursday is week two of my allergy tests.  I wonder what else my weird ass is allergic to?   I'm worried about a friend.  I haven't heard from him in two weeks, which is totally not like him.  I wonder if he's OK?  Don't make me drive out there and find him!!   Need to list some shit on eBay.  Fun times.   I bought a new pair of glasses today, and I have a pair of frames I need to get lenses for.  I'm having my current glasses made into sunglasses; I rock!!   That's all.  Smits is on at 11PM, woohoo!!   Byeeeeeeeee!

      Wednesday May 28, 2003   I thought I updated this sometime between now and Sunday.  Oh well, I guess that's what I get for thinking.   Keith totally borrowed $50 from me.  I'm a sucker and caved in when he asked to borrow it from me.  I'm supposed to go to the softball game on Friday to get it from him, but he knows I'm never home on Friday nights.  I'm going to have my Mom get it from him, and maybe he'll return some of the $10,000 he owes her.  Teehee, yeah right!!   My GTI is supposed to come home today.  His oil pressure is fine, so I have nothing to worry about.  The oil that was in him is too lightweight; I guess VW's don't like lightweight oils, and they don't like synthetic oils either.  I'm just going to continue taking him to George's Foreign Car Service for those fabulous $25 oil changes.  I really don't care how much it costs as long as he does a good job.  He's had my car since Friday night; the damn thing better be fixed!!   I have to take my Mom for some hearing test at 3PM in Alliance.  I love how she makes these appointments with telemarketers.  I told her she is going to need a hearing aid regardless of if she really does or not.  Her reply was, "the girl told me our insurance would pay for it."  And she actually believes telemarketers.  Pinhead.   In order to keep what sanity I have left, I need to get a job where I'm never home.  Like never.  We're gonna leave it at that for now.   I drove the LeBaron yesterday and it is still a piece of shit.   Fromp diggity   OK, I'm gonna go.

      Sunday May 25, 2003   I so did nothing today.  This whole not going to work in Steubenville deal is pretty eerie.  You get used to doing something for almost two months, then boom it's gone.  Kinda strange.   My GTI is still at the doctor; hopefully he'll be ready to drive to Steubenville as the guys want to see my car.  I also have to take Dave a CD I promised to make him.  I'll probably make some cookies too, just to hear Matt bitch about how fat he's getting, and how big Dave's ass is.  I'm gonna miss those guys.   The Malibu is a billion times better than the Focus.  I hate to say it, but I like the Malibu and I'm glad I got it.  The steathily placed cupholders did it for me.  I'm a fan of fancy shit that breaks.  Hence the purchase of the LeBaron, which is still a piece of shit by the way.   Fromp.   I finally got my room cleaned.  Whew, now to get the rest of the place cleaned.   I really need to get to the bank.  Gotta pay the dish bill, and join the Queensryche fan club so I can score some kickass tickets for the concert in Cleveland.  I am so pumped to finally be seeing Queensryche, and with Dream Theater and Fates Warning!!  Woohoo!   I should probably check my PO Box too.  It's been something like three weeks since I've checked it.  Ooops.   Geoff Tate's solo CD totally kicks ass.  Buy it!!   OK, off to the bank.   Byeeeeeeee!

      Wednesday May 21, 2003   Whee, I'm quitting my job.  OK, here's the lowdown.  I agreed to work 8 weeks in Steubenville, but no more than 8 weeks.  The 8 weeks are up next Friday, May 30.  JR suddenly tried to say he never told me it was 8 weeks, that he didn't know for sure.  Sorry, but he's full of shit and he knows it.  So instead of working until the end of June in Steubenville, I am quitting/getting fired.  It's a mutual agreement as JR is an idiot.  So now he has to find someone to work in Steubenville for the next month, and someone to fill in for Akron and Dover.  Good luck jackass!!  I feel bad though, because the guys are the ones who are really getting screwed in the whole deal.  I would have walked out yesterday, but I don't want to stick them with my job, and their jobs too.  I took today off.  I rock.   I purchased a VW GTI.  He's very much cute; his picture is to the left of this entry.   I'm trading in my Focus for a Malibu.  The Focus' seats are hella uncomfortable, and my CD player doesn't work it in.  The Malibu has comfy seats and a built in CD player.  Woohoo!   Gotta pick up the LeBaron today as well.  Of course Montrose said nothing is wrong with it, so I'm just going to run it until it blows up for good.  It still runs, so they refuse to fix it.  I'll break it about right for them.     OK, gotta get my ass going.   Byeeeeeee!

      Monday May 12, 2002   Yeah, been in a crappy mood and not really wanting to update this stupid thing.  But since I pay my $10 a month, I figured I would update it.  My car is in the shop again most likely with a blowing up engine.  Woohoo.  I'm buying a 90 VW Cabriolet and getting it over with.  I refuse to pay $300/mo for a VW.  Yes, I love VW's but I have this thing for paying more than $200-$225 for a car without BMW, Mercedes, Porsche or Ferrari in the name.  I think you get my point.   I had today off for jury duty.  I work tomorrow.  The rest of the week is a giant question mark.  Shit, my life is a giant question mark.   Only 2 more weeks of Steubenville 5 days a week.   Gotta do laundry and mope around the house.

      What an eventful evening I had.  I woke up with spiders crawling on me; nice yes?  That explains all of those little bites on my arms and legs.  I knew we didn't have fleas or anything, so I was baffled as to what the bites were.  Of course when I asked my Mom to please tell the landlord about it so he could have someone come in and spray for spiders, she ignored me.  As usual, she won't do anything about it until it inconveniences her.  Anytime I call the landlord he ignores me as well.  If I didn't help with the rent that would definitely get his attention.  Nice, yes?   I slept maybe 2 hours last night courtesy of the friendly spiders.  I am not in the cheeriest of moods this morning, and who walked in the door but Uncle Bob.  He's here every fucking day he doesn't work (4 days a week), and he's here some days he does work.  I'm sooooo tired of seeing him, and yet I'm the bad guy for not being Merry Sunshine when he appears day after day.  She actually had the nerve to tell me to be nice to him; not to tell him to get lost.  Mind you, I wasn't rude to him, I just didn't engage in conversation with him.  He doesn't call before he shows up, he simply appears.  Plus he stays for hours on end, and I honestly can do without him.  I was fine for 22 years without him being around, but now that Dad's dead we get to deal with his crappy family members because they feel guilty for not being around before Dad died.  Seriously, he needs to go away.   I need to get offline and fax some stuff.  I think I shall.   Later.

      Jesus, picking a college is such a pain in the ass!  I may go to San Francisco State, OSU Mansfield or I may go back to Glenville.  All I know is there will be no commuting back home from any damn location, I don't care if it's just a couple hours drive.  I'm going to stay at school over the weekends and breaks, and try to soak up some young vibes.  I'm getting old dammit!!!!  I drug that fucking book case upstairs, now I have to position it.  I think it'll make a nice table for my stereo, and then I can put my socks/undies drawer under my window.  Sounds like a plan to me!!   Fluffy the cat is a spazz!!!   I need to upload my Moo photo; I should do that before it gets much later, and before I forget for the 40th time today.   Does everyone like my new journal font and color scheme?  I hope so, because it's here to stay!!!   Byeeeeeeeeee!

      The car show at Wink's was pretty good this evening.  I can't wait until next weekend; I'm going to enter the GTI!!!  He'll be the cutest car there.   Brian gave me one of his old bookcases tonight, which will come in very handy for all of my lotions and other useless beauty products.  However, when the genius put the bookcase in my car, he neglected to position it as to allow passenger side mirror vision.  I drove to Arlington Road, then pulled into the BP and moved the fucking thing.  I moved it to the front seat, and the damn bookcase kicked my ass on the way home.  I kept ramming my elbow into it, so now my elbow is bleeding and everytime I'd go around a curve the bookcase would shift and whap me on the head.  I felt like I was in an episode of Jackass only I was the only one seeing it happen.  That bookcase is going down...   I took a picture of the giant Reiter dairy cow in Barberton.  I'll upload the photo and post it tomorrow.  Moo!!   The LeBaron is evil, and that's OK.  I've come to terms with the fact that the car is a giant piece of shit.  As long as I can drive it in temperatures under 80 degrees I'll be OK until Tuesday when my GTI comes home.  The Malibu was beginning to run like shit, so I made it go away.  I didn't have any car troubles until I bought that fucking LeBaron; ever since my car luck has sucked!!!   I believe I'm going to bed.    Nighty!!!!

      The graduation party was OK; it was quite disconcerting that most of Hannah's friends aren't even as old as my cat.  Pretty sad, yes?  I am getting too old, too fast.   My car is finally finished!!  Now I have to pay the taxes, get the title transferred and buy plates then I can pick it up.  I should have him back by Tuesday, then I have to get my ass to Steubenville.  Woohoo!   My room is nice and clean; I rock.   Nothing else really went on today, and I'm off to bed.   Nighty!!!!

      Finally, here's everything I'm allergic to (I know, no one cares): Brazil nuts, blueberries, cranberries, chocolate, lemons, lettuce, cow's milk, oats, olives, oranges, peaches, salmon, shrimp, string beans, trout, turkey, mold, cat hair, karaya gum and red top grass.  I'm slightly allergic to beech trees, pyrethrum (raid), feather mix (down stuff), jute, house dust, cantaloupe, corn, green peppers, perch and rice.  It's great being me!!   OK, CSI is on so I gotta go!!

      Guess who just spent the last 25 minutes laying on her bedroom floor?  Oh I think it was me.  I've been cleaning my room all day, and when I tried to pick up my bed I threw my back out.  I know my back is of the crappy variety, so why do I continue to try and pick stuff up?  Because I'm an ass, that's why.  I had to crawl to my med bag so I could take an Ultram, which I hate doing by the way.  At least I can move somewhat now; this is good.   Still no call about my GTI.  Argh!!!   It's supposed to storm really bad tonight; woohoo!!!   I'm gonna hobble downstairs and watch some useless TV.   Byeeeeee!

I have a job interview tomorrow morning at 10:15; I hope I get the job because I really hate sitting at home all day.     Going to watch some Jackass episodes.  I have them all on tape so as to feed my Chris Pontius addiction.

      Saturday June 21, 2003   What makes you think that you have won When the battle has only just begun? Let the punishment fit the crime Bad things come to those in all good time   My mistake was to put you first Deceitful bubble was so soon to burst I asked you-believe in just us Now my faith lie in mine own justice   How many times must I say I'm not sorry? And how many ways can I show I don't care?   Rotting bodies of enemies  Cannot smell sweet enough to me What is the price of a friend Who would carry out revenge?   In this bleak world of absent laws One in which the just are whores An honor to die for the truth Eye for an eye, tooth for tooth   How many times must I say I'm not sorry? And how many ways can I show I don't care?  Type O Negative "...A Dish Better Served Coldly"

      Like a flash of light in an endless night Life is trapped between two black entities Cause when you trust someone, illusion has begun No way to prepare, impending despair   Did one say so cruel: "Tis better to love than lose" Ignorance is bliss-wish not knew your kiss So many times been burned, this lesson goes unlearned Remember desire only fuels the fire-liar   Betwixed birth and death, every breath regret I pity the living, envy for the dead Emotionally stunned, in defense, I'm numb I'd rather not care than to be aware-be scared   I don't need love   Are a thousand tears worth a single smile? When you give an inch, will they take a mile? Longing for the past but dreading the future If not being used, well then you're a user and a loser   World reknowned failure at both death and life Given nothingness, purgatory blight To run and hide, a cowardly procedure Options exhauseted, except for anesthesia-anesthesia   I don't feel anything.

      Wednesday June 18, 2003   Guess who forgot to have her oil changed this morning at 10AM?  That would be me, but at least I had a good excuse.  Wolfie and I met up in Wooster last (Tuesday) night, and I didn't get home until around 2 this afternoon (Wednesday).  I have one thing to say; 25 across.   Anyway, I guess that was my little mini vacation from reality; now it's back to the really real world.  Yippee.   I purchased the new TON CD last night; have you?   OK, I think I'll take a little drive to clear my head.   Later

      Sunday June 15, 2003   Guess who got sunburned today?  Oh, I think it would be me.  Just my right arm from the elbow down, and my left arm from mid-forearm down.  I look like such a farmer.  Oh, and my nose and cheeks got it too.  What a wonderful way to start my new job.  Dork.   The Stan Hywet show rocked out!!  Only one Ferrari and one Porsche, but that's OK.  The cars were really nice, and there were plenty of them too.  All in all a very good day.   I'm so excited about my new job.  I felt so useless without a job; I was off for three freaking weeks.  It's nice to be gainfully employed again.   I'm working 4 days this week (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday) for training as Kristie's last day is Friday, and I'm the only secretary there.  Gotta learn a lot of shit in 4 days!!!   Whee!!!   Nighty!!!!

      Sunday June 15, 2003   Woohoo, guess who got a new job on Friday??  Me!!!!  I start at a Forensic Psychologist's office on Monday.  How much better could it be?  My hours are Monday, Tuesday and Friday from 9AM to whenever our last patient leaves, usually around 5 or 6PM.  There are a couple other psychologists in the office with him, so it's going to be sooooo cool.  I can't wait!  And I can even wear jeans on Fridays!!!!!  Awesome!!   Today (Sunday) is the Stan Hywet car show in Akron.  I hope to see lots of Ferraris and Porsches.  It's supposed to be really nice today, so that's good too.  The Massillon show (Saturday) was great with lots of cars, and a very rare Porsche as well!  As soon as I find an article on it, I'll post the link.   Please email me with any suggestions for a personalized plate for my GTI.  I want to transfer my old TypONeg plates if I can.  The license bureau ladies said I should be able to, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.  I have a few ideas for a plate, but any suggestions would be cool too.   The poor GTI won't get to come home the week of the 16th as planned.  One of his fuel lines isn't in yet, and the other two didn't come in until Friday.  He'll most likely get to come home the last week of June.  I miss my little pimp car!   OK, I have to get to bed.  I need to be up at 7AM and it's already 20 after 1.  Agh!   Nighty!!

      Wednesday June 11, 2003   Only 6 more days and everyone can experience the joy called "Life Is Killing Me".  Everyone must run out on June 17 and purchase Type O Negative's latest release.  It's too kick ass!   OK, I'm now officially finished with my allergy testing.  I'm now taking Zyrtek once a day, and using an inhaled steroid for my poor crunchy nose.  Hopefully I'll start feeling better soon.   Here's the low down on my GTI.  It's a scary one, so be prepared; $620 worth of work consisting of the following: Three new fuel lines ($145) New fuel filter New fuel filter fuel tank New emergency brake lines New power steering line New power steering reservoir $100 labor  George ordered the parts from Dave Walter VW while I was there, and the GTI will be finished by next Friday.  Woohoo!!   OK, I'm off to bed.   Nighty!

      Tuesday June 10, 2003   Today is my last allergy test; I wonder what else I'm allergic to.  I know cats and feathers really bother me, so down blankes and pillows are certainly a big no-no.  House dust also gets me going pretty well, so I envision a life full of dusting and sneezing.  Woohoo!   It's warm and sunny today, just like yesterday.  Perhaps MotherNature is going to cooperate for the rest of the summer?  OK, maybe not.  In any event, it's a nice respite from the crappy weather we've had lately.   OK, gotta round up my allergy papers and get ready.   Byeeeeeee!

      Monday June 9, 2003   Finally, my laundry is almost finished.  Only 3 or 4 loads left and I'll be all caught up.  I need to take my comforters to the laundromat as I can wash all 4 of them at once instead of washing them one at a time.  I also cleaned out my closet today and found a bunch of VW and Porshce posters.  I slapped them on the wall temporarily, but I need to get some kind of scheme going with them.  That'll be my project for tomorrow.  Well that and straightening my bookcase.    I don't think it's going to rain for the car show tonight; this is good.  Hopefully there will be enough cars there to make it worth my while.   No word yet from George on the condition of my GTI.  I'm honestly not expecting to get the GTI back until around the first week of July which actually works out well.  Lord knows how much it's going to be, but I'm expecting around $500 if I need brakes and a new power steering pump.  Actually more like $600 as the fuel tank thingie is $120 on its own.  That's OK, he's a cute GTI and it'll be worth the expense in the end.    OK, my computer is being shitty as usual, so I'm gonna go.   Fluffy says grrrr.   Byeeeeeeee!

      Sunday June 8, 2003   OK, Hannah is now officially out of high school.  She should be leaving for Myrtle Beach in about 10 minutes.  I hope everything goes well for her, and she has a fab time.  I told her as long as she wears her seat belt, and doesn't sit on any toilet seats, she should be fine.   Tomorrow is the car show on Front Street in the Falls.  It better not rain, and the cars better not suck.   My CD burner does not like me.  Everytime I try to burn a CD, it'll burn the first track then say there was a problem buffering the rest of the tracks.  Fuck you HP USB CD Burner; you may suck my ass.   I keep looking at my Paradise Tea and thinking how good some of that would taste.  Then I go downstairs and forget to take it with me.  I suck.   OK, I'm off to search the classifieds for a jobbie.

      Saturday June 7, 2003   It is so yucky outside.  The car show was pretty much dead due to the cold weather and threat of rain.  There was no one at the Minerva show, and the East Canton show had about 6 cars.  Why does Ohio's weather suck so badly?   I used the new Dove Shampoo this morning.  It's pretty cool, and it smells good too.  I didn't have time to condition this morning, so that'll have to wait until tomorrow morning.  Hannah graduates high school tomorrow at 2PM, then she's off to Myrtle Beach for a week.    Wolfie finally found a car, and he actually bought it!  I'm so proud.   OK, I think I want some ice cream even though I'm allergic to milk.   Byeeeeeee!

      Friday June 6, 2003   Today was a bleh day.  I bought some new Dove shampoo and conditioner; lets see if it's really as good as everyone says.   The GTI is going to be at the hospital for a while.  George is really good, but he takes forever.  I made a list of stuff, so I plan on getting my GTI back in probably 2-3 weeks.  Oh well, at least he'll be all better then.   I really hate life and I'm not going to get into it anymore.   Nighty.

      Thursday June 5, 2003  OK, I think I'm setting a pattern of updating my journal after NYPD Blue goes off.  Ahhhh, the Smits episodes have returned to Court TV.  Woohoo!   I got a job today!  I'll be taking inbound orders for a pet supply business.  Inbound calls don't bother me at all, especially inbound orders.  The people are calling me because they want to talk to me; it's not like I'm calling them out of the blue.  I'll work 20-25 hours a week either noon to 9PM or 4PM-9PM.  Woohoo me!!   I'm doing laundry at 1AM.  Oh well, as long as it gets finished sometime this month.   I do believe the weather is going to be shitty Saturday.  I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it.  Ack.   OK, I'm off to do something.   Nighty!!!!

      Wednesday June 4, 2003   I had to take my GTI to the doctor again tonight.  His fuel pump fuel tank is leaking, and I need to have the brakes checked out as well.  I believe the power steering thingie is leaking as well.  This car is just sucking up my money on stupid shit.  At least it runs well, and the mechanic said I will have no problems with it mechanically.  Whew!!  I drove the LeBaron today to pick up pizza and it got hot, in 50 degree weather.  Oh how I love my LeBaron...   One more week until I finally have my last allergy tests, and I can get some relief from my sneezing, crunchy-nosed existance.  I so much hate that I worked in Steubenville for 2 months, then was totally dismissed for refusing to be lied to and walked on.  I called JR today as I saw my old job (3 days a week) is still in the paper.  I told him I'd like to come back because I liked the job.  He told me he "didn't think that was a good idea" and that he had a few people in mind for the position.  I then told him I wish I had known what a jackass he is prior to my agreeing to do him a huge favor by working in Steubenville.  Then I told him to kiss my ass, and I hung up.  Not exactly mature, but I do feel better now.  I'm sure if he was asked about that conversation he'd simply lie as he does about everything else.  I repeat, jackass.   One of our neighbors are totally getting evicted.  I've never seen someone get evicted before, so I'm all excited.  I know, the dumbest things amuse me.  I did find it to be quite amusing when another of our neighbors had both of their cars repo'd within 2 months of each other.  Teehee!  Honestly, I don't live in the ghetto, it's a very nice place.  My neighbors are just morons who'd rather party and buy grills than pay their bills.   Speaking of paying bills, Keith actually paid back that $50 ON TIME!!  I know, I almost crapped myself too.   I need to photograph my new shoes.  I have around 3 new pairs and both pairs of flip flops rock out.     Wolfie needs to get off of his ass and buy that Firechicken convertible I found for him.  The Trans Am is calling my name, but I do not need 4 cars.  Seriously now, my insurance is high enough on two 4 cylinder cars (one turbo) and a 6 cylinder car.  Like I need a car with the LT-1 engine, and over 300 horsepower.  OK, so I DO need a car like that, but my wallet doesn't.  I'm showing restraint and this is a good thing.   Fluffy the cat is a pimp G.   The Stark County Lincoln Highway Cruise-In is Saturday.  MotherNature better cooperate with us this year!!!  Actually the weather was perfect last year, and I'm hoping it is the same again on Saturday.   I need a cool charm organizer, as in necklace charms.  If anyone has any ideas, email me.  TypeONegative@sbcglobal.net   OK, tired so I think I'm going to bed.   Nighty!!!!

      OK, I finally decided on the shoes I'm wearing.  The winner is...The Red/Black Patent Steel Toed Quad Sole Three Eyes.  I love those shoes.  They're low cut, but very sturdy and they're steel toed.  Woohoo!  I probably want to get in the shower as I'm supposed to be in the Falls by 5:30 and it takes me at least 1 hour and 15 minutes to get there going up 44 to 224 to 91.  I'm not driving the Baron on 77 and taking a chance on overheating while stuck in traffic.  Piece of shit!   OK, I'm off.  I'll probably not update this thinige until Friday afternoon, so until then....Byeeeeee!

      Blah, Blah, Blah...   Totally don't work at the storage place anymore.  Suffice to say I got fed up with her shit, and she fired me.  Well she fired me after I told her to be quiet and let me format letters the way I was used to.  Then she also tried to bitch about my pants, but they are Dockers brand so that pissed her off even more.  That's OK though, as Kelly Services called and they found me a job.  Here's the particulars: In Alliance, about 15 minutes from my house. I'd be collecting on mobile home payments that are less than 10 days past due. Hours are Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday 10AM-9PM with an hour paid lunch and two 15 minute paid breaks.  Friday is 8AM-7PM with the same break/lunch deal. Dress code is jeans, t-shirts, shorts, sandals, boots, tennie shoes.  Really anything as long as the "important areas" are covered.  No tank tops, or belly shirts (oh darn). Now the good part...The pay rate is $10.45 an hour to start, and after 90 days if I'm hired directly by the company, the pay rate doubles to $20.90 an hour!!! The only bad part is I don't start until August 11th.  Yuck!!   Whee me!!  I also have an interview at St. Luke's Senior Care Center on Monday, August 1.  I'll go to the interview as maybe they'll hire me and I can work there until my new job starts on August 11.  Woohoo!   Type O Negative at the Cleveland Odeon in less than 12 hours!!!  The show starts at 8PM, and I plan on being 3 sheets to the wind by 7PM.  I haven't drank in a long time, and since I'm not driving, I'm getting sloshed.  This will be fun.   Hall of Fame Ribs Burn-Off starts tomorrow/today (Thursday).  I may go on Friday after Andrew's birthday party, if not I'll go on Saturday when Quiet Riot is playing.  Hootie and the Blowfish are playing today, and some country guy is playing on Friday.  Bleh.   Bah, what shoes should I wear to the concert?  I'm thinking about my camo steel toed boots, but I dunno.  I'm not going to be down on the floor, so I don't need that much foot protection, but I may wear them anyway.  Or maybe I'll wear the logo Docs.  I dunno, I'm sure I'll figure it out, though.   OK, I'm off.  I have to hang up all of my laundry, and figure out my shoes for tomorrow.   Byeeeeeee!

      I saw the Jimmy Smits NYPD Blue death episode this evening, for the second time.  I'm a dork, you know I cried through the whole thing.  Yeah, so I have a "thing" for Jimmy Smits.  Too bad.   Work tomorrow (Wednesday) at the storage place.  I interviewed this evening for a different job, and I forwarded my resume to a local temp service.  Hopefully I'll find something else soon.  I'm sure I'll wind up telling that woman to fuck off tomorrow/today (Wednesday), so I'll need another job soon.   Nighty!

      Ack, I was only at work for about 5 minutes today.  First of all I felt like I was coming down with strep throat.  Second of all, she was going to send me home anyway due to my shirt and pants.  Now remember, this is a self-storage place.  I had on Tommy khakis and a white Tommy tuxedo shirt, both pieces purchased from the girl section so it's not like I was dressed like a guy.  She states I can't wear that shirt to work, and my pants have to be Dockers and they have to be ironed.  Yes, they are brand specific.  I told her if they want me to purchase a specific brand they should either furnish the pants, or give me money to buy them.  I have to wear Dockers with tennis shoes, a t-shirt (they provide) and a ball cap (provided by them as well).  Also, the t-shirt and pants have to be dry cleaned and ironed!!!  At least the company will pay for the dry cleaning, but still it's just the whole deal that it's a fucking SELF-STORAGE PLACE!!!  I don't have strep throat, but I do have a sinus infection and my thyroid is all screwed up.  I am now taking an antibiotic 3 times a day, an expectorant 2 times a day and the following pills one time a day; Bextra, Synthroid and Zyrtek.  Darvocet and Ultram are as needed for pain (arthritis sucks!!).  I am fucking old and falling apart.   Interview tomorrow evening at 8:30 to be some guy's personal assistant.  That would rock!!!  I can wear sweats to work if I want, and he pays $12/hr for 25/hrs a week!!!  Fucking awesome!!!   I bought the cutest phone today for my room.  All of the Joe Boxer stuff is on sale at K-Mart so I broke down and paid $10 for a phone.  It's hella cute; yellow with the JB smileys all over it.  It even has caller ID!!  I bought the new Dove face wash too.  If the face products are as good as the shampoo and conditioner, I'll be addicted in no time!!!   I'm feeling better in general, and I feel as though things are changing for the better.  That's a nice way to feel.   OK, gotta finish up my laundry then catch Smits on NYPD Blue!!   Byeeeeee!

      Louisville is underwater again.  Route 44 is closed, as is Route 153.  I have no idea how I'm going to get to work tomorrow as it's still raining.  Bleh.  Speaking of that job, I have a feeling that woman is going to piss me off tomorrow.  She had no idea how to use a computer less than a year ago, and she just got her GED two years ago, when she was 53.  Yet she tries to tell me how to use a computer.  'Scuse me, but no.  I'll probably wind up mouthing off and getting canned, but I'm not putting up with any shit from any employer.  My last two jobs I went way above and beyond my job description, and was treated like crap at both places.  No more favors from Lisa.     I have a headache and am going to bed.

      Bleh!  Giant Eagle hasn't had those wings for 3 freakin days!!  Have more food!   I golfed yesterday and today (Friday and Saturday) and learned something very important.  I suck at golf.  OK, maybe whacking the hell out of balls a'la driving range style isn't technically golf, but I still suck at it.  I'm only good when tee-ing off on a baseball field with a number 3 wood into a strong wind.  Don't ask.   On the way home tonight, about 5-7 miles from my house, I got behind a drunk person.  How do I know they were drunk?  OK, it was 2:35AM and they had just pulled out of a bar parking lot.  Plus they were going 20MPH in a 40MPH zone which is usually more like a 50-55 zone (most of us who drive through that zone a lot just ignore the speed limit).  I went to pass them (doing 40-tops) and they swerved to the left.  Crackheads.  People like that are on the roads, yet the cops are too busy giving out $86 tickets for not having a rear license plate light to arrest asses like that.  Go figure.   Um yeah, the LeBaron has started acting up again.  If the temp is over 70 degrees outside, and I go over 50MPH, the car overheats.  So if you see me sputtering down the highway going 50MPH, cut me some slack as my car is a piece of shit.  I still haven't taken my ass to the title bureau for my GTI.  I really, really need to have that done this coming week.  I get off work at 5:30, so I should be able to make it to the Massillon AAA office by 6:30.  I hope.     I went a little nutty at Gabe's on Friday night and purchased 8 more pairs of Sanuk sandals, bringing my total to 11 pairs.  I could not pass up brand new/tags still attached Sanuk sandals for $1.10!!!!!!  Yes, $1.10.  One pair was actually .70!!!!  Deals like that just beg to be taken advantage of.  And the coolest part was most of the sandals were size 5 and 6; must have been my lucky day!  Other than that, Gabe's sucked.  I did buy a pair of comfy soccer shorts for $3 and the cutest t-shirt for $4.  It's white with a British flag on the front, and over the flag it says something like "I find you revolting".  Very cute, and will rock out very much with my British flag Docs.  Yessssssss.   OK, I'm falling asleep so it's off to bed for me.   Nighty!!!!

      More ways to jack up your PC, coming soon with AOL 9.0   OK, the rental car is rented for the TON Cincy show.  I did tell the rental lady the wrong days, though, so I need to call her back tomorrow morning to correct it.  The Cincy show is on August 5th, not August 8th.  Duh!!   Finally, after 2 freaking hours, I got the hood up on my GTI.  I totally don't need to replace the hood release cable as it's sooooo easy to get the hood up on that car.  I felt so dumb once I figured it out.  I had the damn grille out and everything.  Suffice it to say I can have the hood up in 10 seconds or less, without the hood release lever.  I did feel quite handy when I figured it out all on my own!!!   I'm finally getting the GTI legal plates tomorrow/today (Friday).  I didn't do that when he was at the doctor because I couldn't see splashing out the funds for a car I couldn't drive.  That mentality got me a $5 late filing fee, so here's a breakdown of the total:  $5 regular title fee, $5 late filing fee and $35.75 tax for a grand total of $45.75.  Plates will be another $10 or so as I'm not transferring my custom plates until my birthday at the end of September (23rd to be exact; cards and gifts are appreciated).  I'll purchase new plates for 2 months.  Woohoo!!  I also remembered I have two free oil change coupons that I have to use by the end of the year.  Fuck George and his incompetent assed self.  He's not getting his grubby little mits on my GTI ever again!!!  OK, that's enough of that.   I start my new job Monday morning at 8:30AM and I'll work all of next week, Monday-Friday, from 8:30AM-5:30PM with a half hour for lunch.  My regular schedule is 2 measly days a week, 8:30-5:30!!  Nice, yes?   I need to call Glenville in the morning regarding readmission for Fall semester.  I need to know how much, if any, aid I'll receive.  If I get $6,000 or over I'm going back to Glenville on August 27.  If not, I guess I'll keep working.  I so hope I receive enough financial aid!!!  Working sucks!!  Not really, but I'd much rather be in school; I like learning.     Hot damn, the Domino's Pizza plaza about 2 miles from my house has Pepsi Blue in the vending machine.  I am so excited!!  I love that stuff and can't find it anywhere.  Woohoo!   Only 2-3 more episodes before Smits dies in NYPD Blue.  Then what shall I do for my nightly Smits fix??  Argh!!   OK, I really need to do laundry if I expect to have any clothes to wear this weekend.  OK, so I'll have clothes to wear, but they won't be my favorite clothes.  Big difference.   Nighty!!!

      Woohoo, I will see Type O one week from today in Cleveland!!  I can't wait.  Then the Cincy show on August 8th.  Yay me!!   I went to George's today, and he's pulling some shit regarding the gas in the oil situation.  He's claiming he had nothing to do with it, but my injectors may need adjusted.  So I can see it now; I'm going to take my car over on the 30th and he's going to try and charge me another arm to adjust the injectors.  I'm going to have a little conversation with him today (Thursday) and find out what he plans on doing, and how much he plans on charging me.  If he plans on charging me anything, I'm telling him to shove it.  I can take it to Kempthorn VW, have the oil changed for $20 and be done with it.  Besides, they are VW techs so I trust them a lot more!!   I still can't wear my hair down, and it'll probably be 6 months before I can.  Fucking shit!   All right, I'm off.

      I went for my drug test today, no big deal.  It quickly became a big deal when the bitch cut off a huge hunk of my hair.  I was under the impression that they had to pull 5-6 strands, with the root included.  Oh no, silly me.  The bitch cut a gob of my hair off, right at the top of my head.  Now I have a bald spot.  You think I'm kidding?  I'll upload the photo as soon as I get new batteries for my digi cam.  As soon as I saw her with a fistfull of my hair I started bawling right there in the office.  She DID NOT tell me she was cutting my hair until after she fucking cut it.  Had I known, I would have refused the "procedure".  No job is worth that shit.  I know, it's just fucking hair.  But not to me.  My hair is my pride, and she fucked it up.  I come to find out I wasn't even supposed to have the "hair test"; I was supposed to have the "pee test".  The only thing I can do is go back in there and bitch.  It won't do anything productive, but it will make me feel better.  I totally cannot wear my hair down at all.  This is such fucking bullshit.  It took me forever to get my hair that long, and now it's all fucked up.     I did get a Care Bears comforter today, and another pair of Sanuk sandals, but that's so trivial now that my hair is gone.

      Fucking morons.  I've had 6 guys IM me within the last hour "wanting to chat".  Now my profile says not to bother me, yet they still do.  And people wonder why the Internet gets a bad rep.   On the GTI front...There is gas in the oil because George got fuel in the oil when he was fucking with my fuel system.  The guy at Clarke VW, and the guy at Kempthorn VW, told me that when they do fuel system work, especially what my car needed, they always change the oil.  They both told me to call George and tell him I wanted a free oil change since he got gas in the oil.  I did call George and he told me to bring it in next week.  He also claimed the emergency brake doesn't work due to the rear calipers.  Full of shit he is!!  I've learned my lesson and will no longer take my GTI to anyone other than the VW dealer.  Yes, I'll pay a lot more, but at least it'll be fixed right and in a good amount of time.   Going to the Wink's and Brunswick car shows tomorrow (Saturday) afternoon/evening.  Rock out.   Nighty.

      Bah, it just never stops with me.  I went out this evening to check the GTI's oil level and the fucking oil smells like gas.  The oil looks fine, nice and amber colored, but it still smells like gas.  I don't know if that's because the fuel stuff was just replaced or what, but I am going to call George in the morning (Friday) as my oil did not smell like gas prior to him fucking with the fuel system.  He also needs to fix the damn emergency brake that was supposed to be fixed the last time he had it.  I've had the car 8 weeks total, and he's been in the shop 6.5 of those weeks.  Nice, yes?     Got a job today!  I have to take my drug test and have my background check, then I can start.  The only thing my background check will find is a bunch of speeding tickets!!!  I rock!   Needless to say, I'm not in the best of moods due to George fucking up my baby.  However, the Baron ran quite well today.  No overheating hissy fits or anything else bad.  I was shocked.   OK, I'm going to bed.

      I should be in a good mood, but instead I'm in a crabby mood.  I drove my car around for over an hour today and he ran great.  I got home and the oil light briefly came on as I was pulling in the driveway.  I parked him for about 45 minutes, came outside to move him and there was oil underneath him.  I really have no idea how he's leaking oil as all of the seals have been replaced, the oil filter is new and so are the sending units.  Any tips would be greatly appreciated.   I got a job today, and was called for another interview at an optometrist office.  I start my new job on Monday, but it's only 24 hours a week at $9/hr.  The optometrist office is 35 hours a week at $10/hr.  Plus he'll train me to be an assistant.  I dunno what I'm gonna do, but most likely go with the higher paying position as he provides paid medical and optical insurance as well as a 25% pension plan (he pays 25% of my yearly salary into a pension plan for me; I pay nothing).  I'm just happy to finally have a job again.    Since I'm feeling so crabby, I'm going to bed.

      People who email me with questions about my eBay stuff are cool.  They become uncool when they ask 3 or 4 involved questions, tell me what they're hoping the answers are, and when they receive the "right" answers they still don't buy the item.  Even after I take an hour or so getting the info and taking pictures, they don't buy the item.  Don't waste seller's time if you're not truly interested in the item.  That is my Public Service Announcement for the day.   I finally got my GTI today.  The fucking emergency brake still doesn't work, so I get to make a return trip out there tomorrow to bitch about that.  I can't drive the car until I get legal plates, and I can't get legal plates until I pay the taxes and have the title printed up with my name on it.  The rear calipers are bad on both sides, or at least that's what George says.  I'm going to take it to T & T Tire in East Canton as they do brake work on all of my family's cars and they do good work with excellent prices.  Case in point:  George wants $450 for the loaded calipers with brake pads, and labor.  T & T wants $425 for loaded calipers, pads, all the hardware, rotors, if I need them, and labor!  Without rotors it's around $300!  Woohoo!!!!  My main priority is getting downtown to the title bureau so I can get plates as I'd like to drive him to the Friday car show in Akron.  He ran fine the whole way home, as expected.  I love foreign cars!!  His radiator fan still runs after you turn him off!!  As far as I know, no US cars do that because US cars suck!!  Brian's Quaalude has the after shut-off radiator fan as well.  I think it rocks, but then I'm paranoid about overheating cars (wonder why?).   I took the seatcovers off the GTI today; his factory seats are pretty kickass on their own.  I'm sure I'll break down and install the furry moo covers from the LeBaron as they are cute and they match my personality.   The guy I bought the GTI from is a moron.  Most of the fuses are the incorrect amp, and he knew there was shit on that car that needed fixed.  So far here's what I've found that needs corrected: Low beam headlights don't work; the fuse was a 20 amp instead of a 10 amp, but I'll probably need new headlights too. The second after shut-off radiator fan fuse is missing totally. 4-5 fuses are the wrong amps. The left half of my upper brake light doesn't work; that's the bulb. I need to buy colored brake and turn signal lights as my brake light thingies are clear, not colored like usual. A good vacuuming is needed. The sunroof has a big rust hole in it.  Not bad enough that it's eaten through, but it will be soon.  Everytime you hit a bump with the sunroof open a shower of rust rains down. That's all I've found so far. An interesting tidbit about the sunroof...  I called Dave Worshil's junk yard today looking for a replacement sunroof.  I totally forgot about my last Golf (the 87 GL with the broken front tire thingie) that I sold to Worshil's.  He had a sunroof exactly like the one I need.  The guy and I got to chatting and I remembered that was my old car he was talking about!!  The dude said I can come get it fo $40, but I have to remove it myself.  No fucking biggie there!!  I may snatch the seats as well, but the GTI seats are much better than regular Golf seats, so I probably won't.  I will take a piece of plastic or tarp so he doesn't get waterlogged sitting in that nasty old junkyard.  I dunno though, if he's too stripped out there it may pain me too much to operate further on him.  I'm such a dork I cried when I had to junk him.  Yes, I'm that much of a dork.   I almost forgot...Guess who got two VIP passes to the TON show in Cincy on August 8th?  Me, me, me!!!  I'm on Type O's guestlist (which means I don't have to buy a ticket either), and I get to enter the venue an hour before the doors open to plaster the place in TON posters.  I also get to meet the band, take photos and do whatever else my happy ass feels like doing.  It pays to be a member of the Roadrunner Records Street Team!!!!     OK, I'm off to bed.  Another interview tomorrow (Wednesday) at 2PM so I have to be up by noon.   Nighty!!

      No GTI today.  One of the rear brake lines snapped right before I arrived this afternoon to pick up the car.  I have to wonder, what the hell was he doing under the car right before I got there, and why was he tugging on the brake line to begin with?  Supposedly the car will be ready tomorrow (Tuesday) by noon.  I have an interview at 1:15, so I'll drop in after the interview to pick up my car.  Ass.   I went through all of my CD cases and arranged my CD's again.  I'll have to do it again about a month from now, but at least they're straight for now.   Bleh.

      Woohoo!  George's bookkeeper called me this afternoon about my letter to the BBB.  George received the letter on Friday and got all pissed off when he read it.  After he read it, his assistant, the bookkeeper and the bookkeeper's daughter all read it and explained it to him.  They all told him he was at fault and that he needed to give my car back now.  Woohoo!  I pick him up Monday morning.  Woohoo again!!   I wound up getting really pissed at my Mom ealier this afternoon, and I let her have it.  I told her I couldn't stand living with her, and that she never shuts up.  Totally true, both things, but I guess I could have went about it a little better.  Oh well it's done and over with.  If I can't go back to school in August, I'm moving out.     Finally my room is cleaned up again after the Docs explosion.     OK, I'm just so excited to be getting my car back!!  Woohoo!

      Guess who forgot her camera today?  Me!  I finally found the 4 Frank Lloyd Wright houses in Canton/Plain Township, and I forgot my damn camera.  At least I know where they are now, so I can photograph them at my leasure.  One of the homes doesn't even look like a Wright home, it's kinda dumpy, but it's on the list as being one of his houses.  I think my favorite is the one on Plain Center AVE.  It rocks!!     Bleh.   Still no fucking job, and no GTI.  Everyone may kiss my ass.

      I want my fucking GTI back.  This is seriously beginning to piss me off.   Cashland pisses me off.  Call me for an interview, then call me again yesterday and not return my message.  Bitch.   K, I'm done.

      Honestly people, don't use big words you don't understand.  Examples of said words: Honesty and trust.   Now that I have that out of the way... Who's happy it's only supposed to be 74 degrees tomorrow?  ME!!  Finally some good car show weather.  And the Baron won't give me too much crap on my drive to Akron.  Behave for once you piece of shit!!!   My CD burner is being very well behaved today so I'm taking full advantage of it.  Am I the last person on earth to have discovered the joy that is KaZaa?  Man that program is sooooo much better than Morpheus, and the downloads are much better as well.  I've all ready burned two full 80 minute CD's full of songs from KaZaa.  Woohoo!!!   Tomorrow (Friday) I will begin the large task of cleaning all of my Docs.  I clean/protect them twice a year, and believe me, it's not fun.  Any volunteers to help out???  Didn't think so.   I need to figure out how to print a duplicate FAFSA thingie for the Aid folks at Glenville.  If anyone knows how, please email me the hints!!   K, I'm gonna go to bed.   Nighty!!!

      Why can't I freaking sleep?  That's all I ask, just to be able to go to sleep prior to 1AM once this week.  I've finally fallen asleep around 6 or 7AM every day this week, and tonight I even took some sleep stuff.  Didn't work a bit.  Bah!!!   I sold one pair of Docs today for $30.  Why do I buy shoes 5 and 6 sizes too big?  Because I'm an ass, that's why.   I really need to revamp my webpage.  I think I'll try to get that finished tomorrow, but I more than likely won't.   Bleh.    Playlist: George Michael "Father Figure" (See Mark I'm a perv too.) Geoff Tate "Solo CD"

      I received the re-admissions info from Glenville today.  I've all ready filled everything out and mailed it back.  Hopefully I'll find out my financial aid package well before August 27 (move-in day) or September 2 (first day of classes).  I'm hoping to get a room in Pioneer Village; it's just like an aparment instead of an icky dorm.  I hate dorm bathrooms, yuck!!!   I received an email from the Canton BBB today; they received my complaint and have forwarded it to George, it being a copy of my complaint letter.  I expect to receive a phone call from him by Friday, as the BBB just mailed the stuff today, and George probably won't get it until Friday.  He has nothing in his BBB file, so an unresolved complaint wouldn't be too good of a start.  Ass.   I'm going to take a nap as I haven't been sleeping for shit lately.   Nighty!!

      It really needs to stop with all of this storming crap.  Thunderstorms are OK, but I can't handle tornadoes, especially at night.  Grrrrrrrr, I need to get out of Ohio!!   No word yet on my GTI, but I hope to get out to the shop tomorrow and let him know I filed a BBB complaint against him.  Ass.   Still no Piping Hot.  My sleep schedule is soooo messed up, I wind up sleeping past 9PM which is when Piping Hot closes.     Dammit, it's thundering again.  I'm going to shut down the computer; can't have it getting blow to smithereens now can we?   Ack!!

      OK, it could stop storming so I could go to bed.  I went to bed originally around 9:30 hoping to sleep through the night and to stop this staying up until 5 or 6AM crap.  I was rudely awoken at midnight exactly by a hella loud storm, and it hasn't stopped since.  Go away already, I'd like to sleep!!   No Piping Hot last night (Monday), so I'll definitely buy some today (Tuesday).   Going to Akron tomorrow for no good reason, but at least I'll get out of the house.  I'll save the Frank Lloyd Wright adventure for later in the week.   Nighty (I hope)

      Well now, that was quite the interesting afternoon.  I got up at 4:30PM to a voicemail stating the whole area was under severe thunderstorm/tornado warnings.  Thankfully all it did around here was rain really hard, and thunder.  I love storms, but I can do without tornadoes please and thank you.   The Forensic Psych office actually paid me without any trouble!  I couldn't believe it when I received the check in today's mail.  Finally one thing goes right.  The BBB should receieve my complaint against George tomorrow, so I'm really hoping to have my GTI by the weekend.     My home phone is screwed up, so if you are trying to call me use my cell instead.  I can't call out or call in, but the Internet still works (obviously) so I have no idea what's going on.   Tomorrow I'm going to drive around Canton and look at the 3 Frank Lloyd Wright homes in the area.  That will rock out!!  There's one on Plain Center Avenue, one on 44th ST NW and one on Santa Clara Ave NW.  I'll have to MapBlast the Plain Center and Santa Clara locations as I'm not exactly sure where they are.  It'll be nice to get out of the house for a while, and hopefully it'll be sunny outside.  We all know I'm not taking the LeBaron as I don't want to get stuck with an overheating car.     I think I'll order Dominos or Piping Hot as I haven't had pizza in a while.  Whee.   Later.

      OK, just to make me feel bad, the last song on Headbanger's Ball was a cool Anthrax song.  I still think the new Ball sucked though.  I'm used to the Ball when it played good music; you know 80's hair metal and real metal.  I'm a dork...   Went for a drive in the Baron and of course it started getting waaaaaay too hot.  I mailed the thingie for the BBB complaint against George; maybe I'll get my GTI this week.  Yeah right, and I'm going to find a job that pays me $600/week for doing next to nothing.  Oh wait, I had that job and it was called Pro Car.  Grrrrrrrrr.  I miss the guys I worked with in Steubenville, and I have no reason to go see them other than to show them my GTI and to give Dave his CD's.  Fucking George!!!   Dave Mustaine is a whiny bitch, right up there with Lars Ulrich.     I finally got around to editing and posting the Reiter Moo Cow picture.  I rock!!   Alright, I think I'm going to watch my Queensryche vid, or maybe there's something good on Starz or HBO.  I doubt it though.   Later.

      Oh my goodness, the new Headbanger's Ball sucks!!  It used to be soooo good back in the day; now the music sucks.  It's not even metal for gods' sake!!  Testament, Iced Earth, Old Metallica, Megadeth is metal.  Slipknot is not metal, nor is any of the other crap I saw on the show this evening.  I am sooooo disgusted I can't even handle it.  I'm going to bust out my old Headbanger's Ball tapes just to repair the damage the "new" version has caused.    Nothing went on today.  I slept until 4:30PM, then got up and fucked around.  I did fill out the BBB form for George's; hopefully I'll get my car back next week, but I doubt it.   Later.

        HAPPY 4TH OF JULY!!    Just finished watching Jeepers Creepers.  I love that movie, especially how one of the principle characters dies in the end.  Rock out!!     I was dragging my shoes out of the basement, and as I walked to the stairs leading to my room, I managed to impale my foot with a piece of glass.  I didn't think it was going to stop bleeding, and when it finally did, the house looked as though a murder occurred.  There's blood all over the carpet and on the kitchen/dining room floors.  Wonderful!!!   Bleh, I'm finally going to bed.

      I'm still so fucking pissed I could spit blood.  At least I have two interviews for next week so hopefully I'll be able to raise the extra cash soon.  I have no savings left thanks to my Mom conning me out of money for bills.  Nice, yes?  Stop giving Kieth money and maybe you'd have some for yourself.  Ever think of that???   I really need to clean out the trunk of the LeBaron.  I know for a fact my wool Birkenstock clogs are in there, and they are hella comfy.  I think I'll do that now.   Later.

      Guess who was all excited about picking up her car today?  Of course it was me.  I called George's around 4PM to find out for sure the total due with tax (our tax just went from 5.25 to 6.50 and my math skills suck).  I signed off on an estimate of $589.50 plus tax, which would have brought it to around $630.  Fine, dandy.  George then tells me the cost is so close to $900 it may as well be ($880 and change).  This is fucking insane!!  He never called to obtain authorization for work over the estimate, nor did he mention this the 2 times I called him.  His excuse was "it needed the work".  Well that's fucking fine, but at least call me first to make sure it's OK!  It's not like the amount was only $10 or $15; it still wouldn't have been OK, but much easier to handle.  I told him I have $630, and can have the rest in a month.  I'm supposed to call him back tomorrow to find out what I can do to get my car.  It's not like I don't want to pay him for the extra work, but jesus fucking christ, he could have at least given me a little heads up and made sure it was OK before just fucking doing it.  Does anyone else think this is some fucking shit, or am I being unrealistic?  He also said it needs more work as the calipers are shot; funny how they were fine when I asked him about them 3 FUCKING WEEKS AGO.  Were they out hotrodding in my car?  Apparently so as the calipers were "fine" when I took the car in there.  I specifically asked him about the calipers as the back brakes were bad, and I wanted to make sure the calipers were OK.  I was told all was well, and what he had quoted me was all that needed to be done in order to put the car in tip top shape.  Fucking crackhead!!  I was nothing but nice, thankful and polite to him even after he had my car 1.5 weeks to change the oil and install two oil sending units; why does shit like this happen to me?  My $1500 car has cost me $2500 so far and the calipers are over $100 each!!!  Fucking shit!!!!   The only good thing that happened today was I received soundcheck passes for 3 Queensryche shows, and meet and greet passes for Thursdays' show in Pittsburgh.  Rock out!!!!   I'm still all riled up about my car.  First it was Montrose and now George's.  It's not like I bitched at their high prices (both places) or the fact that he takes for-fucking-ever (George).  I didn't deserve this shit!!!!!

      OK, I had one Watermelon Spike and one SKYY Blue and guess who woke up with a headache?  I suck.  Thankfully some leftover Taco Bell cleared it right up, though.  I'll have to secrete the drinks in my room once I get to school as the campus is dry.  I am not going to the local tavern for a $3 beer or $3 shot when they don't have any beer I like, or any shots I like.  I don't drink "beer", I drink "malt beverages".  Beer tastes like wet feet smell, and it's just icky.  I can buy a 6-pack of SKYY Blue for $5, or I can pay $18 for the same drinks at a bar, and that's even if the bar has SKYY Blue.  You do the math.     I just found out Glenville moved all four of us originally in building 8 room O and put us in building 8 room N.  Did the Glenville people have any intentions of letting us know about this little move?  I called down there to make sure I still have a room (I do) and to find out about the furnishings.  The girl tells me "We have your application right here; we've moved you to a different room."  What the fuck?  Anyway, the pinhead had no idea how big the room is, but I did find out about the Net, TV, phone and living room furnishings.  The T1 Net connection is totally free, as are the phone and cable.  The living room has one couch, two chairs, one long coffee table and two smaller end tables.  The students have to provide a TV, VCR, DVD and their own phones.  We also have to provide trashcans, silverware, dishes and bedding.  Duh!!  I have enough comforters to blanket the whole fucking building, and I have a whole set of dishes in the basement that I've never used.  I need to find some silverware, but we have so much here at home I don't think my Mom will notice that I scammed some out of the silverware drawer.  I also need to call my Aunt Donna to find out about the boxes she's supposed to get me.  I'm leaving in two days and not a damn thing is packed.  I ROCK!!!   Later

      Today was interesting enough.  I had to run to K-Mart for gauze and Neosporin, and on my way home some drunk guy runs right out in front of my car.  I should have hit the drunk bastard, but I just wanted to get home.  I couldn't believe it!!!  I've been drunk, but never that drunk.  Ass!   Speaking of drunkeness, I am drinking a Jack Daniels Watermelon Spike.  Ultra hella good, then I have SKYY Blue for later.  What a lush...   OK, I'm on the phone now.  More later...

      Well, it's official.  I am not getting enough aid for the Fall semester.  I am still going to school, though, and I have no idea how I'm going to buy $600 worth of books.  I am going to try calling the Direct Loans people myself, just to see if that financial aid lady is lying, or if they really have changed the loan procedure.  I borrowed all of my loans for a semester one time in Akron, and wound up with over $4000 being refunded.  Now the aid lady is trying to say the loans can't be disbursed this way?  Something is fishy about the whole situation.   October is my target month.  We'll get my Dad's pension check in October, and it's for around $30,000.  I'll be able to comfortably go to school, but for the next 2 months it's going to be stress city.  The check won't come until the end of October, so it's really the next 2 months.  I can feel another cold sore coming on from all of the stress.  Maybe the WV sniper will get me my first week in WV.  That would be a blessing...   OK, if you have time to bid on eBay items, but don't reply to my emails, you may suck my ass.  You know who you are...   The Perv is a sweetheart (you know who you are too).  Thanks for being a true friend.   I so need to clean my room, clean the townhouse and get my stuff packed.  I have no energy to do any of the three, least of all pack my stuff.  I've just felt so blah since Sunday; I know it's because I'm worried about everything, but I still can't shake it.     OK, I'm off to have leftovers of Piping Hot Pizza from 2 days ago.  It should be good and ripe by now.  LOL

      Seriously, this computer kicks my ass.  Not to brag, but it's sooooo awesome!!!  It's nice and fast, plus the screen is pretty big.  I've spent most of the night burning CD's.  My old computer had a burner too, but it never worked right due to the crappiness of the PC.  Woohoo for technology when it works!!   A Beetle commericial is on and it reminded me of a Beetle I saw today.  It was a Turbo S Beetle, with the same engine as a Porsche Boxster S.  How insane is that???  The guy who had the Beetle was really cool though, and told me all about it.  I was seriously jealous...   I asked my Aunt Donna to get me some boxes for my school move.  It's been a week since I talked to her and she hasn't called me.  She'll show up Friday morning with the fucking boxes as that's what she did when we moved.  She knew when we were moving, so she showed up the day of the move.  Seriously, my Dad's family are all fucking crackheads.   I am addicted to Snapple's Kiwi Teawi.   I need to get a pillow; the computer is frying my legs.   I played the included Pinball game, and scored over 3 million.  Is that good??   OK, this computer is making me sweat it's so hot.  I'm off.

      I am now back online, obviously!!  A new IBM Pentium 4 Thinkpad makes my day!!   School in 4 days.  I talked to the loan lady at Glenville today, and she claims I absolutely cannot receive all of my loans at once.  I know she's full of shit, though, but I can't tell her that.  I will wind up owing GSC $500 because they are splitting my awards.  I'm hoping my Dad's pension check will come in October or so, that way I can pay everything off and be happy or something.   I'm stuck using dial up until my Yahoo DSL CD arrives, but it's not too bad.  Much better than on my old PC, but then it was a piece of shit.   I need to figure out how to tear the back seat out of the LeBaron.  That will be fun.   OK, I'm off.   Byeeeeeeeeee!

      OK, it's tomorrow.  Anyway, I was watching Halloween 4 on AMC, but it's too edited to enjoy.  AMC is better than local channels when it comes to editing movies, but it's still not as good as the original version.     I didn't make it to Dillard's tonight, I was sidelined by Rally's and Border's, but I will make it out there today, Saturday.  I have Jess to thank for that little adventure.   I saw a guy at Border's who caused me to burst into hysterical laughter.  The guy had on a white suit, with a white ribbed wifebeater underneath, plus he had the total Don Johnson/Miami Vice hair, facial hair and tan thing going on.  I followed him around the store while playing the Miami Vice Theme song ringer on my cell phone.  I'm an ass. On a similar note, I saw an Acura Integra of early 90's vintage at Giant Eagle.  Not a big deal in and of itself, however, the driver side front tire was snapped clean off.  Having experienced that, I understand what the girl was going through, however I did not offer my diagostic services siimply because she looked like a skank, and she was smoking.  Besides, the car was drastically lowered so it probably wasn't lowered correctly which caused the problem to begin with.  The car was red with white graphics, and a huge assed fin on the back.  Come on now, have some restraint people!!   Barberton car show tonight, plus a visit to Dillard's and the new store in Chapel Hill.  The new store is another dollar store deal, but it has all kinds of shit and everything is a buck.  They have Nescafe Frothe for a buck, plus Banquet frozen dinners 2 for a buck!!!  I'm so there...   Alrighty, I think I'm gonna take my skanky ass home now.     Nighty!!!

      OK, now I'm at Akron.  I went to two stores and spent waaaaaaaay too much money today.  I found Hello Kitty stationary, and a Hello Kitty toothbrush set.  I also found some other Hello Kitty stuff, and a bunch of charms for my charm bracelet.  Woohoo!!!   I was reading Jess' journal and came across the fact that Ralph Lauren now has Ralph shampoo and conditioner!!  I am on my way to Dillard's as soon as I'm finished with this post.   I believe I will receive enough aid for everything to work out well.  I have emailed the loan lady, and will be crossing my fingers all weekend!!   OK, I'm off!!  Sorry, but no more updates until tomorrow night!!!!

They're going to become a trophy pair, or to compare it to a car, they're becoming trailer queens.  Yes, I just did.   I went shopping, I'll have photos of my new favorite comforter tomorrow.

      Whee, one day closer to school time!!  I talked to Rog today about the serial sniper in WV, and he said I have serious issues.  I was telling him how I hope the guy isn't caught prior to my arrival at Glenville, and Rog said I'll wind up being his 4th victim.  If I'm going to be murdered, that's how I want to go out; a victim of a serial killer.  As Rog said, I have issues...   Steph sent me the most kickass boots for my birthday!  Thanks Steph!!!   If anyone knows where I can download the Jackass Theme for a Sprint PCS LG 5350 phone, please email me!!!   I'm off to bed.

      OK, my body needs to decide what the hell it's doing.  When it's hot out I'm cold, and when it's cold out I'm hot.  It's not even 60 degrees right now, and I'm sweating my ass off.  I even had to jack the A/C way up.  Hopefully the heating/cooling in Pioneer Village is individualy controlled according to room.  If not, I have a feeling I'm going to be miserable through no fault of my roommates.  It's not their fault my temperature system is all messed up.   I had an especially uneventful day today.  I changed my sheets, and washed the clothes I wore this weekend.  I also called around to find out prices for my move to Glenville.  I have a feeling I'm going to be borrowing a friends' truck, and leaving the GTI here.  I guess the worst case scenario is I can leave the GTI here, and drive it back when I come home the weekend of 9/13.  All I know is I am not leaving him here the whole time I'm in WV.     I watched my TON "After Dark" video this evening, then I watched "Dirty Harry."  They just don't make movies like that anymore; especially the musical score.  Dirty Harry has some awesome 70's pimp music!!     I wound up calling the vet office this morning prior to going to the interview.  I asked the lady how soon they were going to hire someone, and she said they still have another week of interviews to get through.  I then told her I wasn't interested in the position as I was returning to school in less than two weeks.  She was very nice about it, and I wished her luck in her search.     I emailed the student housing secretary to inquire about the living room furnishings, and the size of the bedrooms, in Pioneer Village.  Of course she never emailed me back.  The people at Glenville never return phone calls, or emails.  That's the biggest complaint I have about GSC, so I guess that's not too bad.  Parking is only $25 a semester, and Akron's parking is $130 yet there's still nowhere to park.  Glenville always has enough spaces because so many of the students live on campus, right next to the classrooms.  I'll drive when the weather is bad, but otherwise I'll walk to class.  It's probably a half mile each way, but it'll be good for me.  I'll probably drive every Wednesday, though, as I have class from 8AM to 9:30PM and I'll be butt tired by the time 9:30PM rolls around.  Plus being alone in the woods at night scares me; too many serial killer books I guess.   Speaking of serial killers, what's up with the serial sniper in Charleston?  I think that's only about an hour from GSC; finally some excitement.  I'm glad this started prior to my arrival, or my dear readers may think I was up to no good.  I just like reading about serial killers, and I hope to study them one day.  I do not, however, hope to become one.  : )  I just wanted to clear that up.     I've had this Henry Rollins quote running through my mind all damn day, so I'm going to share it with you, dear readers..."Here's a rowboat, call it a trailer, go fuck your sister."  Ahhh, the rage of Hank Rollins.  LOL   OK, I need to MapBlast the closest towns to Glenville that may have a mall!!     Nighty!!

      I just laid the smack down on an old boyfriend.  He was bitching and moaning because his current girlfriend is ignoring him.  I simply told him it was payback for all of the times he ignored me to go to his stupid lodge meetings or whatnot.  Awww, now he's not IM'ing me anymore.  Oh darn.  Heehee!!   Not a damn thing went on today.  I checked the oil in the Baron and the GTI, then I started the GTI and let him run until he was warmed up.  Imagine my glee when I turned him off, and the radiator fan kept running.  The dumbest things put a smile on my face.  His oil doesn't smell like gas anymore either, so that is good too.  I just need to get the rear brakes fixed, then I'll tool around town in style.   Interview tomorrow at 1PM, but I'm really thinking of blowing it off.  Odds are they'll call me the last week of August and want me to start work.  Um no.  I guess I'll go as I'm not doing anything else, but still, I know they're not going to hire me right away.     OK, I'm tired.  I think I'll pee then go to bed.   Nighty!

      Nothing great went on yesterday; it was a crappy day so there were no car shows or anything.  Today it's storming so I guess there won't be any car shows today either.  My LeBaron is very close to throwing a tire.  Let me explain...I nailed a curb on Thursday at Long John Silver's.  The Baron had been pulling to the right to begin with, but now it's really pulling to the right.  I need struts, brakes, calipers and rotors at all four tires and I need another A-Arm for the driver side front.  I hate that car.  My GTI needs rear brakes including calipers and rotors to make him road safe.  I need to win the lottery!  Not even a huge amount; $5,000 would come in quite handy right now.  Agh!!!   I'm off to rummage up some food and turn off the computer before it gets struck by lightning.   Later!

      Ack, guess who was "let go" yesterday?  We had a test covering all of the systems we learned the first 3 days.  All 6 of us trainees took it, and 4 of us failed it.  All 4 of us were "let go."  The trainer told us it wasn't any big deal, not to worry about it and it was used to gauge what she needed to go over more thoroughly.  Well now, I guess that was a line of shit.  The two who passed it were the two people who've already done collections for at least a year.  Oh well, I was just going to quit next Friday anyway.  I do get paid for Monda-Thursday so that's good at least.   I have an interview at a vet's office on Monday at 1PM.  Hopefully she'll hire me on the spot, and have me start the next day or something.  Most likely she'll fuck around, though, and call me the day before I leave for school.  People piss me off, A LOT!!   My area wasn't affected by the huge power outage, but I guess North Canton and Alliance were.  Some of Akron now has power, and some doesn't.  It'll be interesting tonight to cruise around the areas that don't have power, but it'll probably be eerie tonight as well.  Oh well, it's those damn Canadians' fault!!!   Nothing else is going on.   Later!

      Blah, blah, blah.   Work was work today, and thankfully it moved much faster than the first two days.  I listened to a few collections calls, and the actual collections part isn't bad at all.  The only part that sucks is all of the damn screens you have to use, and the stupid codes.  I'm sooooo glad I'm not going to have to keep that job!  A kennel I applied to 3 weeks ago called me today.  I'm supposed to called back between noon and 4 tomorrow (Thursday) to talk to the lady.  How much would it rock if I could work there my last week in Ohio?  I love animals, so that would be a fun job.  I need to get a Glenville area phone book, and call about jobs prior to arriving.  I can fax/email my resumes earlier than most students and get a jump on the job market.     I had Long John Silver's for lunch/dinner tonight, and it rocked.  I drive right past LJS on my way home, so it's only natural that I'd stop there.  : )~   The 77N ramp off of 30W is now closed for 2 years.  WTF??  Now I have to go 30W to 77S to the Cleveland AVE/RT 800 Exit, then take that to 77N.  Seriously, the Canton civil engineers need to stop trying to think.  Bah!!   I'm off to bed.  Only two days of work left until the weekend!!!!   Nighty!

      Finally, Blogger is working again!  I tried updating last night, but Blogger wouldn't post or save my entry.  Oh well, it's working again and that's all that matters.   Second day of training is down.  I know of at least 2 people who won't be continuing past the 2 week training period, myself included.  This place is cool as far as dress code and pay, but the programs you have to learn (4) and the way you have to flip back and forth is a bit much to learn in two weeks.  We are sitting with collectors tomorrow for around an hour, so that'll give all of us a chance to see how to use these applications in real time situations.  These two weeks will be the easiest $1,000 I've ever made, so I can't complain...too much.  LOL  I just keep thinking to myself, less than two weeks to go.  I may work the first day or two of the third week, just to have a couple extra bucks for my first week at Glenville, but it's nice to know I don't have to.  I have an appointment to get my hair cut and colored on August 29th, so we know I'm not working that day!!   No word from Glenville on my financial aid package.  I'm hoping to get that within the next couple days.  With my luck, though, I'll get my award letter on the 28th when I have to leave for school on the 30th or 31st.  Like I said before, I don't care how much it's for as I AM going back to school this semster.   I feel like I'm getting a cold or something, and I've felt like this since Sunday evening.  Probably because I haven't had any Zyrtec since Friday and the mold and crap is really high right now.  I may want to refill my prescription, you think??  For some reason my joints are really bothering me too, especially my right knee and ankle.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, getting old sucks!!   I'm actually looking forward to tomorrow's training class as I get to sit in on real collection calls.  This should make for an entertaining day, or at least an entertaining hour!   Off to bed...

      Mmmmmm, alright.  My first day of work is over.  Honestly I didn't do anything today, but it still wore me out.  You sit at a desk for 8 hours, doing nothing, then let me know how worn out you are.  I know there are much worse jobs, and much more physical jobs, but sitting can make you tired too.  I'm the only new person there with any sense of the computer, so it's like PC101 for now.  I guess we're going to try to get on the phones next Wednesday the 20th, but with the way things are progressing I don't think we will.  For every half hour we learn stuff, we have an hour's discussion on nothing.  My kind of training!!  There's 6 of us, and only 1 guy.  We range in age from 50-20, and only half of us have collections experience.  Everyone so far is very nice, and that's a big plus!!  We got out early today because our trainer didn't want to start a new section then have to stop halfway through it.  Woohoo!  I'm home in time to watch Knight Rider, and you know that's where I'm off to now!!   Less than three weeks until I go back to school!!!   Later!!

      OK, the new next door neighboor is weird.  I've noticed a few weird things about her: 1.) She has 6 kids, with no Dad around and all of the kids look younger than the age of 6.  Nice. 2.) All of the girls wear dresses all the time.  Like nice dresses, dresses they'd wear to a wedding or church (we're talking about little girls here).  The boys wear regular kid clothes. 3.) The Mom walks around in hospital scrubs all the time, and walks with her head down, all the time.  It's like she's trying to hide something. 4.) The kids are outside rarely, and when they are it's for 15-20 minutes only.   5.) They are noisy as fuck!!   OK, so maybe my observations aren't shit, but I still say something funky is going on next door.  I'm so glad I'm outta here in 3 weeks!!   Speaking of being out of here, I have set up a donation thingie through PayPal.  Now I do not expect anyone to send me any money, especially my faithful readers, but I figured I'd set it up anyway just in case someone is dying to send me a billion dollars.  I've name the fund "Help Send Lisa To College" which I think is an applicable title.  Actually it's the "Help Lisa Get Her Crap, GTI and LeBaron To School" fund, but that's OK.  I'm going to have to rent a U-Haul big enough for all of my crap plus my GTI, and I'll have to rent one of the little trailers for my LeBaron.  Notice how the GTI will be inside the U-Haul, and the Baron is stuck on the back.  It's not going to be fun, or cheap.  Anyway, I don't expect any donations I set it up more for fun.  I've seen some blogs where people actually have to pay to read the entries!  I think that's not only ridiculous, but very pompous of the blogger.  Who are they to think people would actually pay to read their blog???  I keep this blog as a form of therapy, and I feel I should be paying all of you, my constant readers!!  Anyway, many thanks to any of you who do donate.  The link is over to the left.   Here's something interesting that happened last (Saturday) night.  Brian and I were buzzing down Graham Road in the Falls, and this guy suddenly decides he's going to turn right in front of us.  If this guy would have actually hit us in the Quaalude (Honda Prelude) there would have been some shit go down.  Had we been in the Baron I would have swerved to help the guy hit us.  He was obviously high or drunk, and when Brian and I gave him the finger and called him a fucking something or other, the guy actually had the nerve to yell at US!!  Excuse us for minding our own business and then getting upset when someone almost creams us and the Quaalude.  People never cease to amaze me.     Along that same line, here's another story... I bought an item on eBay about 2 months ago.  I purchased a postal money order as payment because my PayPal account was screwed up.  I mailed the payment.  The seller still hasn't received it, and I told her it must have been lost in the mail as a lot of my shit gets misdirected.  She then calls her local PO and files a complaint telling the postmaster that I said someone was stealing my mail!!!  I never told that cunt anyone was stealing my mail.  Now she has the postal service crawling all over my local PO's ass because she told them I said people were stealing shit.  Now yes, a lot of my mail gets lost or delayed, but I've never said anyone was stealing it.  I have to put up with all kinds of shit now due to that dumb bitch not paying any attention to what was being said to her.  She also told her postmaster that I had sent two money orders, when I told her I wasn't sending another payment until I could trace the first one.  Well I managed to lose the fucking MO receipt, so I just sent payment again via PayPal so I'd have proof it was sent.  I repeat, dumb cunts make my life miserable.   Speaking of being miserable, I've had more cold sores this past year and a half than I've had since I was 16.  I get maybe one cold sore a year, tops.  Well I've had 5 in the past 6 months and I know it's due to stress.  This last one popped up halfway through the TON concert on Tuesday, probably because I was worried about doing a good job with the Street Team stuff, and I was worried about everything not going well.  Hanging out with the guys was hella fun, and made that cold sore worth it!!  I can't wait to get to Glenville so I can have a nice vacation.  Yes, I consider school to be a vacation.  I like to learn, and the classes should all be pretty easy, plus all of my utilites are paid including phone and a T1 Net connection!!  Woohoo!  I just need enough money for tuition, and a new PC.  Actual college fees are $6,000 and I can get a nice Dell PC for $500.  Like I said, over $7,000 in aid is my target, but I've always had bad aim.  LOL   OK, I'm off to do something useless.

      OK, so far today has sucked.  I finally fell back asleep around 9:30AM and got up at noon.  I woke up all phelgmy and gross feeling.  Now it's 10 till 3 and I'm supposed to leave in 10 minutes for Akron.  Only problem is I haven't even got in the shower yet.  I'm going to be late to my own funeral.     Bleh.

      Oh ack.  The new end neighbor's kids woke me up at 6:45AM.  Thankfully I'm only going to be here 3 more weeks.  Woohoo!   Last night Steph had a taste of what it's like to live in Ohio.  Her house wound up flooding (no relation to the weather) and there was a tornado!  Remind me not to move to Palm Beach.     Today is hopefully going to be a good day.  I'm gonna try to get a little more sleep as today is going to be busy.  Damn kids!!!

      I just downloaded the GSC course listing for Fall 2003 semster.  Now I get to try and plan my schedule to allow maximum work/study/fuck around time.  I'm trying to get classes on 2 days a week, but I know I'm in a dream land if I think that's going to work out.  I'm trying for Mondays and Wednesdays only.  It'll make for busy days, but I'll have a lot of down time too.  Plus, maybe I can find a fun job while I'm down there.  Extra money would rock, and unless I get over $7,000 in financial aid, I'm going to need a job before the semster is over.  I know I qualify for both subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans, and I got the Perkins loan when I went to Glenville the last time.  I'm an independent student (I was the last time I went to GSC), and the fact that I've been unemployed for 2 freaking months will probably help my aid situation.  Anyway, I'm off to finangle my Fall schedule.

      Alright, here's the set list from the Cincinnati Type O Negative Show on Tuesday, August 5.    I Know You're Fucking Someone Else Wolf Moon Anesthesia Black Sabbath Intro Christian Woman Love You To Death World Coming Down Kill All The White People Prelude To Agony My Girlfriend's Girlfriend I Don't Wanna Be Me Black #1    Bleh.  I was watching Warlock on Sci-Fi, but they edited it waaaay too much for it to be enjoyable.  I'll just watch it tomorrow on VHS.     I need to call Glenville again and find out what's going on with my Fall schedule, and if I can have both of my cars on campus.  As usual, no one at Glenville knows how to return a phone call.  Asses.   Start my new job in 4 days!!!  Woohoo!   OK, I'm off.

      OK, the show last night blew my ass.  The actual performance rocked out as usual, but the rest of the experience sucked.  I arrived at the venue about 5:45PM, yet I didn't get in until close to 7PM!  The show started at 8PM, so I had about 10 minutes prior after getting in until the doors opened.  Nice, yes?  The will call woman was a cunt.  Everyone from the band (Tom, Richard and the drum tech) were excellently nice.  However, I didn't get to meet the band via the Street Team.  I met the guys by being in the back of the venue at the right time.  Wouldn't you know I didn't have my goddamn camera when I was around back!  I talked with all four guys, and Johnny had on a MOPAR shirt I would have killed for.  All were in jolly moods, and Pete was his normal sarcastic self.  The coolest thing was when I asked Pete to chat he said he had to take a massive shit, but he would be back in 15 or 20 minutes.  True to his word, he did come back.  How rockin is that????  The Street Team thing is a bunch of shit.  I never received my promo materials for the before and after show handouts (CD's, stickers and posters to put up in the venue), and the guestlist stuff is shit too.  I could have used my $5 ticket and got right in.  But instead I waited around outside because the bands' guestlist wasn't at the will call window, or at least that's what the cunt said.  I think she was full of shit and just trying to ruin my evening.  I'm going to try one more time at the September 13 show in Huntington, WV.  I'll be in WV for school, so I may as well try the Street Team shit once more.  All of the hassle was worth it though, as the boys played Anesthesia!!!!  I got all emotional and shit; I even teared up.  I'm a dork.    OK, I'm gonna go for now.  I'll have more detail and such later on this evening.   Byeeeeee!

      I am one excited dork.  I received my housing assignment for Fall semester at Glenville, and I got a room in Pioneer Village!!  Kick ass!  There's a link on the left to the Pioneer Village info page; check it out!!!  Even better, I don't have to attend stupid orientation so I can work longer.  I can't move in until August 31st, which is fine with me!!!   The training hours for my new job are 8AM-5PM Monday-Friday for 2 weeks.  That kicks ass!   OK, gotta get ready to leave.  Byeeeee!

      Why oh why did I wake up at 6:30AM?  I didn't go to sleep until 3AM, and I'm wide awake at 6:30AM?  Figure that one out for me!   Tomorrow is the day; Type O in Cincy day!  I'm so nervous I could puke.  I have no idea what to expect, and thankfully some guy emailed me to introduce himself.  Thank goodness for the kindness of strangers; maybe he can give me some insight as to what's expected of me, and what to expect, tomorrow.  I know, it's just concert Lisa.  Well it's not just a concert to me as this is my one chance to prove myself to the Street Team powers that be.  I was a lowly loser on the eTeam and got the chance to take a stab at a Street Team task.  This is big, and I'm hella excited.  I can remember thinking that I'd never meet the band; that I'd never get to see them in concert.  Well here it is 10-12 years later and I've met all of the guys multiple times, and now I'm helping promote them?  What more could I ask for?  Yes, I've been listening to TON since I was 11!  I've been boring people with my TON related diatribe since 91; see it's not just you wonderful Internet folks who have to put up with me babbling on about them.   : )~   I need to plan my outfit and footwear accordingly as tomorrow is going to be a long day.  I plan on leaving by 11AM, and it's at least a 4 hour drive, probably closer to 5 hours with the Ohio state flower (orange road construction cones) being in full effect.  Then I am driving back tomorrow as well; the hotel idea has been nixed due to my poor ass.  I am renting a car though, a shitty Cavalier.  This should be fun.  I don't trust the LeBaron (obviously) and I'm not driving the GTI that far without knowing the road conditions in advance.  I could just imagine how crippled I'd be after riding in that car for 4 hours.  I've been seriously thinking about raising him at least an inch, and possibly taking him back to his original ride height.  If I bought stiffer springs I'd still have that nice road feel, just my butt, and tailbone, would be spared a bit.     I start my new job one week from today, so this is good.  I told the lady at the interview if I got that position I wouldn't be able to work August 5 or 6 as I was going out of town for a concert, and there was no way I was missing it.  She was cool about it and that was when I first found out the job didn't begin until August 11.  I figure you only live once so I'm going to stop worrying about work and shit.  The only thing I want from life is to have my two Ph.D's someday.  Is that too much to ask?  I didn't think so.   Alrighty, I'm feeling tired again so I'm going to try that sleep thing once more.

      OK, the Galleria in Cleveland sucks ass!  The only good thing is a store I found with an assload of Docs in Steph's size.  She is happy, but they had nothing for me.  Grrrrrrrr.  Oh well, at least Steph's getting some cool Docs at a great price!   Woohoo, Type O in Cincy on Tuesday.  I'm sooooo excited!!   I really need to upload all of my new Sanuk photos.  I'm being lazy, I guess.   I think I'll hit Target today and see if they have the Dove face stuff yet.  I got a dollar off coupon, so maybe I'll buy the toner and the moisturizer.  My face is greasy enough, though, so I don't really need moisturizer.  Nice, I know.   OK, gonna go.

         Happy 6th Birthday Andrew!!     The show was great!!!  We got to the Odeon at about 6:50PM, and the doors didn't open until around 7:30PM.  We got in, bought three shirts (at $25 each) and went upstairs.  I am way too old to put up with moshing and all of that other crap, so it's upstairs for me.  Anyway, we grabbed seats in the uppermost tier of the venue, right beside the potties!  I ordered up a Bacardi Silver (quite tasty), and settled in for the show.  The opening act was Lacuna Coil, and they were actually really good.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I believe they played 6 songs, from 8:05-9PM.  Type O came onstage at 8:59 and rocked out until about 10:45.  I was at Rally's in Akron by 11:45!!!  I got home around 2:15, washed my hair (icky cigarettes) and went to bed.  I have the setlist that I'll post later this evening.  I am sooooo excited for the Cincy show!!!!  I have plans to throw shit at Johnny, and to make off with Pete's scrubs.  Woohoo!   Now I have to figure out what to get Andrew for his birthday.  The party starts at 6, so I need to make up my damn mind.   All of the paperwork is completed for my new job.  I start August 11, and receive 2 weeks of training.  I'll work in the 10-29 day accounts to begin with, then I can move up if I feel comfortable taking on longer delinquencies (and the mean, bitchy people they'll bring with them). I think I'll do best in the 10-29 day area, though.   Ribs Burn Off tonight after Andrew's party.  I may go tomorrow night as well as I'd like to see Quiet Riot, especially because of a story from Mark the Perv.  I swear, that guy...   OK, I'm off to round up some grub.  It's almost 3PM and Lisa hasn't eaten yet.

      I just had the LeBaron Bomb towed to the Chrysler dealer in Weston.  The service manager was going to try and charge me for the tow, so I called Chrysler directly and they informed him the tow was covered under my warranty, and I did not have to pay for it.  Hopefully that didn't piss the guy off too badly; I'd like my car to be fixed this time.  I'm tired of dealers, and everyone else, screwing me.  Cars are beginning to suck.  So I'm without wheels until God knows when; this is strange.  Maybe I'll con someone into driving down and picking me up this weekend, and I'll start driving the GTI.  Who needs rear brakes anyway?  LOL   OK, I'm off.

      Thursday was OK.  I went to a role-playing meeting and met some pretty interesting people.  My Mom called during the meeting to tell me something is wrong with Fluffy.  I'm really worried about him; I'm 4 hours away and have no way to get home and see him.  This sucks...   On a bit happier note, I got an "A" on my first Human Sexuality test.  Right now I have a 4.0 GPA in all of my classes.  Who rocks?  I DO!   Things have been relatively calm lately, so I'm waiting on something to happen.  I know, such a pessimist, but if you lived my life you'd understand why I'm like this!   I'm now addicted to the Starbucks Caramel Mocha frozen slushy thing that is at the snack bar.  They're $3.79 each, and sooooooooooo worth it.  I love my meal plan with 350 flex dollars!!  I've had a bunch of food from the snack bar, and haven't even used $20 of my flex dollars.  I think they give discounts or something, because I've had $20 of their cheese sticks alone.  I'm a pig...   Roommates are at a volleyball game; woohoo!  One day they'll be all nice and quiet, then the next day they're back to their usual inconsiderate selves.  I managed to wake all three of them up this morning at 6AM; fuck being all quiet when I get up in the morning.  They don't have the same courtesy for me, so they may fuck themselves.   My  urlLink VW Water Bottle  tastes like soap; ick.   OK, I'm off to find mischief.   Later Gators!

      Yeah, I guess it is true that you feel worse before you get better.  I feel like shit yet again today, worse than yesterday, so I missed all of my classes.  I do have an excuse, though, so it won't go against me.  That is good...   My birthday blew ass.  Thanks to Jess, the Perv and Steph for wishing me a happy birthday.  Everyone else may go fuck themselves.     The roommates have a volleyball game tonight at 7PM, which means Lisa is making Kraft sketties around 6:30PM.  Woohoo!   I guess I should go on campus to check my mail.  Blah.   At least I did get my shoes organized last night, and I managed to cram all of my clothes onto the bar in the closet.  Nice.  I know, don't bring so much shit.     I'm off.

      Woohoo, I'm starting to feel better.  I went to my first two classes, Intro to Psych and Human Sexuality, then went to the campus nurse and the snack bar.  I finally got some antibiotics, I've taken two so far, and I'm already starting to feel better.  I didn't sleep for shit last night, so I came back from my running around, took my first antibiotic and an hour later I was out.  I slept from 11:30AM-5PM with minimal interruptions.  I did wake up once because Sarah was playing her music way too fucking loud, but Kenny told her to turn it down because I'm sick and was trying to sleep.  I'm sure she loved that.  Anyway, I feel better and that rocks.   I only missed 2 questions on my Intro to Psych exam!  Woohoo!  The Human Sexuality exam was really easy, too.  It took me maybe 10 minutes to get through 50 questions.  I rock out!!   I'm going to finish watching 8MM, then arrange my shoes.   Later gators.

      Ugh, I feel horrible today.  It all started around 11PM last night.  I got worse and worse as the night progressed, and today I feel really, really bad.  Remind me to thank the campus nurse for not giving me antibiotics on Friday; I've been miserable all weekend because of it.  I know it's a sinus infection as my face hurts, my ears are clogged and hurting, I'm hacking up red/green/yellow goobers and the roof of my mouth itches.  Nice, yes?   I feel confident that I will kill my Human Sexuality exam tomorrow.  Woohoo!   I had the T1 connection for all of one fucking day.  I went to study next door last night, so I unplugged the StinkPad and carried it next door.  When I came back from studying I hooked the StinkPad up to the LAN connection, and it won't connect to anything.  Glenville's Technology Office may bite my ass.   I lost the roll of toilet paper I've been carrying with me for my boogery nose.  Where the hell is it??   OK, I'm done.    Lisa's Birthday In Two Days (September 23)!!

      I'm still not 100% but I do feel better than I did yesterday.  It would be nice if the A/C worked so I wouldn't be quite so warm, but when you have morons for roommates these things happen.  They froze me, and now I'm roasting because the A/C is frozen up.  It was off all night, and when I turned it on about 15 minutes ago it still doesn't work.  I guess I'll continue to roast.   On a similar note, Kenny is nice enough, but I'm really tired of him practically living here.  The girls had to leave for a game this morning, and Kenny is still here.  The nice part about it is I will be able to get away with anything as they won't be able to "snitch" on me for fear of getting busted themselves.  I guess there's an upside to everything, isn't there?   I woke up at a quarter til 7 this morning.  I've washed and dried my laundry, plus taken a shower and emptied the trash already and it's only 9:30AM.  I rock.   I think I'll get something to eat, then watch TV.   Later!

      Well today I did nothing.  Woohoo!  I did go to the neighbor's apartment for a couple hours.  We hung out, looked at Avon books and chatted.  It was a nice break from my normal boring days.   Classes tomorrow, then a boring weekend ahead.   I faxed my resume to the local doctor this afternoon.  Hopefully his office manager calls tomorrow while I'm in my room.  I'll probably stop by on my way back from classes tomorrow morning; I'm finished at 11:30AM.  Stopping by as a follow up can't hurt anything, and it will show that I'm very interested in the position.  Cross your fingers for me!!   Bleh.

      OK, I talked to the Perv for about 3 hours and he gave me perspective on the psycho bitch, amongst many other things I will not get into on here.  I'm no longer all pissed off about psycho bitch, but I still think the woman is seriously unbalanced and needs professional care.  She was threatening to use her job to make my name "mud".  I guess she doesn't realize by emailing me her intentions she provided me with proof positive of what she did, if she does try to make my name "mud".  People need to think before they type, or open their mouths.  Then that makes me wonder how miserable she must make her family when things don't go her way.  Those poor people!  Anyway, she's psycho, I have the item to ship out a third time, and I'm not going to think about it anymore.   Anywho, I just finished my Jello cotton candy pudding, and I'm off to bed.   Later Gators.    Lisa's Birthday In Five Days (September 23)!!

      Oh my goodness, people are fucking psycho.  I sold this woman a pair of boots for her granddaughter over a month ago.  I shipped them once, they were returned to me for insufficient postage.  That's fine, I reshipped them a second time and they were returned again.  She emailed me over 12 times this evening threatening to make my name "mud".  This woman is crazy!!  She took the time to track down my school schedule, and even made a map to my old address by tracking my info on mapblast or mapquest.  She's a fucking nut job, and I've already told my Mom if she calls or shows up at the house to call the police.  Fucking nutty people.  I'm shipping the damn shoes one more time with Delivery Confirmation, Signature Confirmation and Insurance.  If they're returned to me again, she's shit out of luck.  She already received a PayPal refund, or at least PayPal has already approved her refund.  She's going to wind up with the boots and the money.  Nice, yes??    Other than that fucking crazy bitch, nothing went on today.  I had my first Intro to Psych test, and it was hella easy.  My other classes were pretty run of the mill and nothing to report.   I'm off to mull over nutty people.   Byeeeeeee!    Lisa's Birthday In Six Days (September 23)!!

      Well now, I'm stalling around trying to delay returning to school as long as I can.  I plan on leaving around 3PM so that means I'll arrive in Glenville around 7PM.  Ugh, I'm not looking forward to the drive down there.  If I knew my car would make it with no problem I'd be OK.  But with driving the Baron Bomb I am not OK with any drives longer than 15 minutes.  I really hate that car.     I took thespark.com's bitch test, and I scored 75%!  The award is to the left with the rest of my useless links and crap.     OK, I'm off to shower and have birthday cake.    Lisa's Birthday In One Week (September 23)!!

      OK, there is something very funky going on with my blog.  The entry area is all small, and I can't access any of my settings to try and fix it.  Also, the template area is so small it will take me years to find the links area in order to update anything.  I hope to have this happy shit fixed soon.   Finally I'm doing my weekend update, when the weekend's over!   I got home around 3:30 Friday afternoon; I left Glenville at 11:45AM.  I stopped at the car museum on the way home, though, so I would have arrived home right aroun 3:45PM; 4 hours after I left.  Fun, yes??  I picked up my Glenmoor VIP pass from Bob, then came home.  Friday afternoon/evening was spent chasing the cat and pissing around the house.  I was in bed by 9PM Friday evening. Saturday morning I got up at noon, and was in Akron around 3PM.  I went to Applebee's for my birthday dinner (all you can eat rib tips), then went to the pet store (Petsmart) and the dollar store.  I found the cutest socks at the dollar store; they're pink with the Popsicle logo all over them.  Woohoo! Sunday I woke up at 11AM, and was at the Glenmoor show by noon.  Stayed at Glenmoor until 2PM, then went to Swenson's for lunch.  Came home around 4PM and bitched about my headache until 8PM, then went to bed by 8:30PM.  Nice, yes?  Finally my headache went away around 1PM today after I took 4 Advil.  I believe it was coming home to Fluffy the Cat that caused my headache fiasco.  Dammit!!   For any of you who read this entry earlier, I have no idea what that stuff at the bottom of my entry was.  The blogger program was acting quite funny earlier this afternoon; it appears I managed to hack into someone else's account without even trying.  Yes, I'm just that good!!!  LOL   OK, I'm going to finish watching John Carpenter's Vampires, then I'm off to bed.  I have a long day tomorrow, back to Glenville I go.   Later.

      OK, I just got back from watching the De La Hoya/Mosley fight, and even I can tell something was funky about it.  Mosley won, yet he didn't connect on as many punches, nor did he fight as well as De La Hoya.  I smell a rat, and it wasn't Mosley's captain's hat wearing trainer guy.   Obviously I made it home in one piece.     Glenmoor show today!   Lisa is tired therefore she is going  to drive home and go to bed.   Nighty.

      Well now, today was quite interesting I must say.  I got out of Intro to Criminal Justice an hour early, and I made new friends.  I am a dork. On the same dorky note, I have my first written homework assignment and I'm excited as all get out.  Woohoo!!   The weather actually isn't too bad today.  It's warmish, but there's a nice breeze and it's not too humid.  Had I not been too lazy to shave my legs, and been able to wear shorts today, I would have been a little cold.  Oh well, at least it's not raining or ultra hot.   Since I had over an hour's break in between Abnormal Psych and Criminal Justice, I decided to eat at the cafeteria.  I got there right before the lunch crowd came in, and that's the best thing I can say about the experience.  The food gave me heartburn immediately upon ingestion, and it's still kicking my ass.  Nice, yes?  Now I remember why I do not eat at the cafeteria!!   I had  to clean up after my roommates again.  The trash was overflowing and the sink was getting full of dishes.  Everytime they have friends over they leave a big mess that they don't clean up.  I'm going to have  chat with them this evening regarding their share of the cleaning responsibilities.  It wouldn't be quite as bad if they'd at least thank me for cleaning up after them, but I don't even get that much out of them.  Bah...   OK, I think I'll do my homework assignment.  Heehee!!

      Um, OK.  I feel fine today thankfully, but now I'm worried about the LeBaron making it to Parkersburg which is only an hour away, let alone making it the whole way home.  That car runs more and more crappily every time I drive it.  Now when it starts up I smell a really strong exhaust/gas odor.  Nice way for a car to run when it has 20,000 miles on it.  Piece of shit!!   The roommates have very much warmed up to me.  We converse a little bit everyday; this is good.   OK, I have to retrieve my alcohol from my car.  We had room inspections today so I had to hide my SKYY Blue in my car.  I feel like a 15 year old trying to hide beer from her parents.  Goodness!   Byeeeeeeee!

I'm also getting sick thanks to the A/C being jacked up so high.  I'll probably be good and crabby by Friday.  This sucks.   I'm going to converse with Ben and Jerry, then finish studying.

      Well now, three out of the four washers were finished; the big washer has 10 minutes left.  It'll be another hour and a half or so until everything is dried.  Isn't this fun?  Why do you people read the journal of such a loser?  I am 23 years old, on a college campus with a cool-assed apartment and all I can find to do on a Saturday night is laundry.  Really now...   I hope the grocery store is open tomorrow as I need more Green Box spaghetti.  Yes, I need it.  LOL   Alright, I'm going to find something else to occupy my time for 8 more minutes...

      I copied CD's to my computer for around 3 hours, then I yapped on the phone for 2 hours and now I'm doing laundry.  I'm procrastinating on the whole studying thing, just in case you couldn't figure that out yourself.  I do have all of tomorrow to read though, especially since I'm doing my laundry now.  Speaking of laundry, I didn't pay a damn bit of attention to what time I got back upstairs from the laundry room.  I guess I'll go check my clothes now...

      Alrighty then, I've finished with two chapters each in Human Sexuality and Intro to Psych so I'm rewarding myself with some Internet action.  LOL   I went on an adventure last night to the huge town of Weston.  It's a 45 minute drive to the closest Wal-Mart, but I guess it was worth it.  At least I got out of the apartment for 3 hours; that was nice.  I found a hot plate for $5!!  To celebrate the purchase of my new hot plate, I had Kraft Green Box spaghetti last night.  Seriously now, no food has ever tasted as good as that skettie tasted last night.  I wouldn't say I'm homesick per se, but I am bored out of my skull.  What I miss is having people close by to talk to, and having fast food/malls close by.  If I meet people down here I'll be fine; until then I'm bored silly.   I really seriously need to do laundry.  I'm down to my last towel and my last pair of Adidas shorts.  I stepped outside briefly, and it is cool enough for jeans.  Woohoo!  Unless you are female you do not understand the pain in the ass that is shaving your legs in a shower with no tub.  There's nowhere to prop your leg, and the fucking shower head is sooooooo high on the wall, I can't even adjust it to keep my shaving cream from washing off.  These apartments are not short people friendly.  I can't reach the top of the fridge, nor can I reach the top shelves in the kitchen.  I know, grow some legs...   I'm currently rocking out to Fleetwood Mac's "Say You Will" CD.  Talk about post-Psych decompression tunes, that CD is it.  I remember when I first bought the CD I was shocked as it's so not like their previous CD's.  Sure, some tracks sound like old Fleetwood Mac, but most of the tunes do not.  I seriously love this CD, and I like all of their other releases, so I guess they're doing something right!   Yesterday I performed my weekly good deed.  On my way to Weston I passed by a lady who's vehicle was broken down on the side of the road.  I turned around, and offered to help.  She had already phoned a tow truck, so she and I chatted for a few minutes.  It turns out she's a Bio student at GSC, and from the looks of her she's a lot older than most students.  I did get her name, but of course I forgot it.  I suck.   I finally have the T1 connection, but it's not connecting for some reason.  I took my laptop to the technology office last night and they checked it out for me.  When it's plugged in at the tech office the T1 connection works fine, so it's not my computer or cables that are fucked up.  I'm supposed to call the tech office on Monday and ask for one of the network guys so they can fix my in-room connection.  Finally, I'll be able to Kazaa again, and I have a ton of photos to upload as well.  I refuse to upload, or download, anything on a dial up connection.  Bah!   Alright, I'm going to copy a bunch of my CD's onto my computer, then it's back to the books.  I only have 40 pages each of Criminal Justice and Abnormal Psych to get through.  I'm so glad I'm a fast reader!!   Later!    Six Days Left Until I Go Home For The Weekend!

      Tales from the freezer...   That should be the new name of my blog as it's freezing in here!!  My roommates left at 1PM, then I ran some errands (ie: went to the bookstore and to buy my parking permit) and I came back to the apartment.  I immediately turned the A/C off and it's still freezing in here!  I've been back for 4 hours and it's still cold.  That should give you some idea of what kind of icebox I'm living in.   I am roommate free until late Saturday night.  Woohoo!   I cleaned the apartment again as I was tired of looking at the clutter, and I'm tired of the gnats.  You see, they leave dirty dishes in the sink, which in turn draw gnats.  Everyone who knows me knows of my aversion to bugs, no matter how small the bugs are.  I especially hate gnats!!  Anyway, the apartment is now sparkling clean and will remain so until they return from Tennessee.   I bought my books today.  Freaking expensive assed things.  One book alone was $135!!  And that's without any CD-Roms or anything.  What a fucking rip off.  I really should read the first chapters to Intro to Psych, Human Sexuality and Abnormal Psych, but I'm putting that off a bit longer.   Still no T1 Net connection.  I'm going to beat the hell out of the technology people if I don't have that connection by tomorrow afternoon.  I'm finished with classes at 11:30AM; I better have the T1 connection when I get back from class or some heads are going to roll.     That's it, I need another shirt and some socks.  Bah!!

      Well now, the roommates talked to me this evening.  Here's how it transpired:  The roommates have a bunch of guys who come over all the time.  Well the guys always come into my room and talk with me as well.  One of the guys called me after he left and asked me to tell one of the roommates something.  I then explained to him that they don't talk to me therefore I wasn't relaying any messages to them.  Along the conversation went, and the guy wound up calling my roommates and gave them hell for not being nice to me.  Well, with all that arm twisting, they finally talked to me.  I know we will never be "friends", but at least now we may be able to converse in passing.  They're not leaving tonight, they're leaving tomorrow (Thursday) at 1PM, and are coming back Saturday night.  The two I talked to, Sarah and Amber, both seemed OK.  They are in my Psych of Human Sexuality class; they're minors are both Psych.  I can't remember what they're majors are, or even if they told me.  Oh well...   It's raining again!  I swear, it's never going to stop.   OK, I'm going to watch the Cosby Show and then go to bed.   Nighty!

      Yeah, things are the same on the roommate front.  It's still cold as fuck in the apartment, and they're still not talking to me.  If they ever do speak I won't know what to do; do I bow or do I curtsy?  One good thing, I got almost all of the classes I wanted for this semester.  I didn't get Contemporary Computer Applications, but I did get another class in that time slot.  Here's my Fall 2003 schedule:  Intro to Psych  MWF 8AM-8:55AM  Psychology of Human Sexuality MWF 9:15AM-10:10AM  Abnormal Psych MWF 10:30AM-11:25AM  Intro to Criminal Justice MW 1PM-2:20PM  Not too bad, huh?

      Well I "met" my roommates.  Since they got here around 2PM, I've spoken maybe 25 words to them.  None of them bothered to introduce themselves to me, and I have yet to speak to the girl I share the bathroom with.  I initiated both converstations with the other two girls.  The second girl I talked to seemed to be the nicest of the three, but still, they could have at least said hi especially since they all know each other.  It would be nice if we were able to converse, but at least we're not arguing with each other.  They have the A/C jacked up higher than fuck, though, so I'm freezing my ass off.  Better than roasting to death, I guess.   Tomorrow is registrar, cashier, bookstore day.  Won't that be fun?  I also need to get a parking permit, and pay the fucking parking ticket I got on Friday.  I parked in the housing director's spot as I didn't think he'd be here on Friday evening, and I was moving my stuff in, plus there was a handicrapped spot right next to it.  I came out to move my car around 10PM, and I had been ticketed at 9:34PM.  It's only $10, but it's the point of the thing.  I was moving my stuff into the apartment and I get ticketed.  Yet he parked his fat ass in the handicrapped spot and didn't get a ticket.  Nice, yes?   I'm doing my first load of laundry in the college laundry facilities, which are in the basement of my building.  I have 16 minutes before the washer is finished.  Hopefully it doesn't mangle my clothes, then I'll have to hurt someone.   I should have the T1 connection tomorrow; this is good.  The photo I have posted to the left is of my building.  I'm on the upper right side, well that's actually the living room window.  My bedroom is in the back, on the left side of the apartment.  It's a hundred times better than a dorm room, but I do wish I could chat with my roommates.   OK, I'm off to sit on my ass.

      Well, I'm in Glenville.  I arrived around 5:30PM on Friday, so I can't go to the registrar's office until tomorrow at 8AM.  My roommates still aren't here.  I guess they're volleyball players and they had a tournament in Florida.  I'm nervous about meeting them; what if we don't get along?  The good thing is, if we don't get along that's OK because they'll never be here with games, practices and class.  Still, I hope we can at least tolerate each other.   The cable hook up in the living room doesn't work, so I had to drag my TV back into my room last night.  The T1 Net connection isn't hooked up yet either, so I just got online last night via AOL dial up.  It's killing me the slowness of the connection.  I did take some pictures of the apartment, which will be posted as soon as I get a fast connection.   I think I'm going to make a sandwich and fuck around for a bit.   Later...

      Could I have had a worse week ever?  I don't think so...   My Mom had Fluffy put to sleep yesterday morning (Saturday morning).  He was 2 months shy of his 20th birthday.  She didn't even take him to the vet to see if his arthritis could be managed with meds.  She just had him put to sleep.  I now refer to her as the cat killer.  Harsh, but she didn't even see if Fluffy could be helped; she just ran out and had him put to sleep.   I was awake from 10:30AM Thursday to 6AM Saturday.  I drove from school to the house, then from the house to the car rental place, then to the car rental place home, then from home to Toledo.  I was at the Queensryche concert for one hour as I got there at 10PM, then Toledo Dave and I drove around until 4AM.  I fell asleep on the Ohio turnpike around 5:30AM, so I pulled over at the Towpath service plaza and took a half hour nap.  I then woke up and drove home through Akron and Fairlawn.  I got home around 9AM, and slept until 4PM.  Then I went to the Factory of Terror last night, and also to Wal-Mart and K-Mart.  I went to sleep at 2AM and woke up this morning at noon.  I have a headache and want to smack someone, but it's still nice to be out of Glenville.   I sincerely need to straighten up around the house.   I haven't updated this thing in a week because my new laptop broke.  I went to class on Monday and it was fine.  I got back to my room around 3PM on Monday, and the monitor wouldn't come on.  The computer part worked fine, but the monitor wouldn't work.  I called IBM and they sent me a box to facilitate the return of my laptop.  I've had this computer almost 2 months and the monitor already went out.  I used to think IBM StinkPads were good, but now I'm wondering.   The BaronBomb has been fixed for over a week, but I don't have the $500 to get it out of the shop.  Hopefully I'll be able to get it out of the shop this week.  I am going to have to drive the GTI to school, which is not something I want to do.  Oh well, I have two exams Wednesday that I can't miss, so the GTI is making the trip.   I'll update this thing later on, I'm tired now so I'm stopping.

      Woohoo, I won 4 Queensryche tickets for $6, and they're 3 rows from the stage!  I can't believe it.  Watch the seller not contact me because the tickets didn't go for any amount near what his Buy It Now was set at ($250!).  Either that, or I won't get my car back by Friday.  That will really piss me off...   3 days until I go home.  I'm leaving Wednesday after my Intro to Criminal Justice midterm (probably around 3:30PM), and I'll be back in WV on the 19th (Sunday).  I'll be OK once I get my car back because I can drive into Weston when I need something that resembles a real city.  It gets really old being stuck in Glenville without a car, and no way to get to the store.  I haven't been out of Glenville since the September 14th when I came back from Ohio for my birthday.  Someone kill me...   My deer were out again this evening around 7PM.  I saw 4 of them this time, and I'm sure there were more that I didn't see.  I tried getting a picture of them, but they were too far away for me to get a good photo with my digi cam.   I'm off to shower, then do my homework for Human Sexuality.

      Ugh, I spent from Noon to 6PM painting the Dracula set.  GSC is performing Dracula at the end of the month, and I was suckered into tagging along for today's work session.  I was told it was only going to be a couple hours; a couple wound up being 6!  It was nice to get out in the sunshine, but still, it would have been nice to know how long I was going to be there so I could have taken a beverage.  Oh well...   I'm off to recover....

      OK, it's official.  I'M A DORK!  I was sitting here emailing Toledo Dave and I happened to glance out the window.  There were three deer just hanging out on the hill, eating grass and wagging their little tails.  I got all excited and called next door.  Sherri looked outside and said there was 8 of them out there!  I've seen deer before, but never just looked out the window and there they were.  It's a good thing we didn't have deer like this at home; my Dad would have constantly been shooting at the poor things.  Maybe Glenville isn't so bad after all...   I totally missed all of my classes today.  I woke up at 6:30AM and thought someone had shot me in the tummy. Suffice to say I wanted to die.  I felt like that up until 4:30PM when I finally drug my happy ass out of bed for some chicken broth.  That seemed to do the trick as I feel fine now.  Strange things bellies are...   OK, Sherri and I are going to do laundry.  Woohoo!

      Class was pretty good today, even our Criminal Justice prof managed to make it interesting. He seems like a really nice guy personally, but his teaching style does need some work.  He's a new prof though, so it's understandable. I can't believe midterms are the 15th!  I only have one midterm, in Criminal Justice, so I'm not worried about it.  Part of the exam is in take home format!  Woohoo!   Queensryche concert the 17th in Toledo.  Toledo Dave and I are attending, and I have soundcheck passes plus Toledo Dave works at the Stranahan Theater!  Woohoo again!   The Chrysler dealer still has my car!  The guy I've been talking to claims they should have the estimate tomorrow morning.  6 days to get an estimate for a radiator and water pump?  Goodness!   Here's a list of stuff I'd kill to have:   urlLink Care Bear Bookbag      urlLink Care Bear Long Sleeved Hoodie T Shirt WITH EARS!!!      urlLink Care Bear Hoodie Sweatshirt (Grumpy Bear) WITH EARS!!     Please send them to my school addy.  LOL   I was planning on going to bed hella early tonight as I only got 4 hours of sleep last night, but the roommates and their drunken friends insist upon slamming the fucking doors and being loud at 10:30PM.  I've never known such inconsiderate people in my life.  I've stopped cleaning anything other than what I use ie: bathroom, my dishes and my room.  I never use the living room or the kitchen counter therefore I'm not cleaning it anymore.  It may be petty, but why clean up after people who don't even appreciate it???  Would you?  I thought not...   I'm off to clean my glasses; damn smudge!   By the way, I found the roll of toilet paper I had been using when I first got sick.  It was hiding under my bedside table!

      Christ, I need a job.  I spent the majority of the day SLEEPING.  I am soooo bored, you can't even begin to imagine.  I'm calling the Dr. office and State Farm tomorrow after class, and I'm begging them for a job.     I've been without a car for almost a week; not fun.  I'm calling the Chrysler dealer tomorrow and finding out when I can pick up my car.  I found a garage in town who'll fix my car for $375 including the new radiator, water pump, oil change and labor.  Woohoo!   I want to go home.

      The LeBaron's water pump and radiator are bad.  Neither of the parts are covered under the 3 year/36,000 mile warranty.  A radiator  from Advance Auto Parts is $150 and the water pump is $30.  Could this have happened at a worse time?  I think not.   Not that anyone cares, but I got a "B" on the Abnormal Exam.   I'm going to hang myself.

      Woohoo, I don't have to get up until 7:15AM!  I just took my shower so it's sleep in time tomorrow.  Riding the Amish van to class is pretty cool!  No more of getting up at 6AM so I can leave for class at 7:15AM in order to get a parking spot.  I may continue riding the Amish van even after I get the Baron Bomb out of the hospital.   I hate cold weather, did I ever mention that?  Actually I don't mind cold weather; snow is what I hate.  Well snow and cold temps with wind.  And everyone laughed at me for bringing my scarf, hats and gloves this semester.  HA!   Off to bed for me...

      Why am I listening to a Trans-Siberian Orchestra CD in OCTOBER?  Probably because it SNOWED TODAY in Cuyahoga Falls/Akron.  Fuck that!   I'm now leaning towards staying at Glenville until December, then transferring back to Akron U.   OK, I'm finished now.

      Hmmm, I could have sworn I updated this thing yesterday.  Oh well...   Yesterday was pretty uneventful.  I took my first Abnormal Psych exam and I believe I did very well on it.  Mr. Jeffrey will give us our scores tomorrow.  As long as I do well on that exam I'll still have "A's" in all 4 of my classes.  I do have another Intro to Psych exam tomorrow, though, and after I take that I'm not sure I'll still have an "A" in there.  Bah!   It's around 45 degrees here and the roommates keep turning the A/C on!  Everytime I turn it off they run right over and turn it on.  It's going to start snowing in here pretty soon!   I called the Chrysler dealer in Weston today and the guy told me they're looking at the Baron now, and should know something by this evening.  If I don't hear from them today I'll call them tomorrow around noon when I get back from classes.     I'm contemplating dropping out and going home.  Lets just say I'm tired of freezing, being bored, not having a job and otherwise feeling useless.  Plus Halloween has always been my favorite holiday and there are no haunted houses down here.  I keep thinking that I shouldn't drop out because I'm doing so well, and I'll still owe for my loans.  I dunno, I'll figure something out.   I have to pee and I think my clothes are finished washing.   Bleh.

      Thankfully I only mildly injured myself while moving stuff around last night.  Sleep repaired the damage, but I'm sure I'll hurt myself again soon.   It's relatively warm out today, so I think I'll adjust my headlights and replace fuses today.  I also need to install a bulb in my driver side turn clicker; that'll put an end to spastic clicker-ness.   I just faxed my resume to a couple of places; someone needs to hire me.  Need a computer dork?  I'm your girl.   I think I'll finish watching disc 3 of the NYPD Blue Season 2 set.  I watched 2 episodes last night before bed; I'll finish it today.  But then it's not like I haven't watched the whole set at least 3 times; it's a boring world I live in.

      I kind of rearranged my room.  Actually all I did was move my bed and bring my laptop upstairs off of the dining room table.  I need to find a way to move the air conditioners without giving myself a hernia (can women get hernias?).     I was bored so I've added an "Ask A Question" feature to both my blog and my webpage.  Feel free to ask whatever you want; I don't embarass, or offend, easily.  I'll answer the question, or questions, as soon as I can.   OK, I'm off to throw my back out completely by trying to move two air conditioners by myself.  Won't this be fun?

      Yeah, someone's slacking.  Too bad...   The GTI scared the shit out of my Thursday night.  I was puttering along around 70MPH on 77S right before the Strip, and my car decided to pop out of gear.  I was buzzing along fine, then all of a sudden the engine revved up and stopped revving; as if I were at a stop light or something.  I immediately pushed the clutch in, then tried to put the gear shifter in neutral; it was already in netural!  I slowed down, put him in 4th gear and continued driving along just fine.  He seems to be fine now, but it still scared the crap out of me.  Yesterday on the way to Jeff's house for Turkey dinner the GTI decided to run like shit.  He wouldn't idle for crap, and I had no acceleration.  Turns out the distributor cap had water in it, which was causing it to misfire.  Jeff is getting the cap, rotor and new plugs so he can change them for me.  It's nice to have a useful brother.  Plug wires for my car are $250 (Bosch; I won't buy cheap ones)!  The cheap ones are over $100.  Ah, how I love having a GTI...   On another GTI note, he is now officially named.  His name is Gizmo.  Here's my rationale:  Gizmo is little and cute; my GTI is little and cute.  Gizmo has pointy earys; the GTI has a fin that could be considered pointy.  Therefore my GTI is now named Gizmo (didn't I just say that?).  Either I rock, or I have waaaaaaay to much time on my hands.  I think it's a little bit of both.   What else...The Cathedral Buffet on Thanksgiving was hella good as usual.  Earnest Angley wasn't there the little freak; I was disappointed.  Oh well, the actual buffet never disappoints.   Michael Jackson scares me, and I don't mean that as a compliment.  Freak.  I do not want any of his Neverland Ranch Dressing, please and thank you.   I called Turtle and left a message on his answering machine about a 3 legged cat with 7 nipples on its head.  His new roommate will think Turtle and I are nuts, and his roommate will be correct!   I believe I'm going to the CorningWare outlet in Aurora today to buy the hooch-berry something for Christmas.  Mmmmmmm, outlet stores....   I am once again audio blog capable.  Expect rambling incoherant posts at 3 or 4 in the morning.   I should probably take a shower or something.   Later.

      OK, the fact that I'm listening to "Hurt" performed not by NIN but by JOHNNY CASH should make everyone giggle.  The sad thing is, this song is actually good!  Radio @Netscape Plus is my new friend.  I've listened it maybe 2 hours and I've already heard 2 TON songs.  Woohoo!   The GTI is a macking little car.  If one more person almost runs into me, or my Mom, while staring at my car I'm going to have to repaint him and make him "normal".  That would not be fun.  STOP STARING PEOPLE!  Sheesh, he's just a VW.  I love VW's but lets be honest, it's not a Porsche (OK, in a twisted way he kinda is) or a Ferrari.  Staring is not necessary.  Although it's not everyday you see a chick in a  urlLink purple-eared Care Bears beanie  driving around in a grey/white VW GTI, so I guess it is OK to stare a little.  LOL   The TON show kicked my ass as usual.  I didn't stay for Cradle of Filth as Moonspell was more than enough of that type of music for one night.  Pete has a Fu-Manchu going on; I don't know if I like it or not, but I guess that doesn't really matter now does it?   Rog wanted me to watch the Browns/Steelers game with him this afternoon, but I didn't get up early enough to go with him to his buddies' house.  Wish I would have as the Steelers won!  Woohoo!   Perv where are you?  Email me punk.    On another GTI note, I so sincerely need to get his struts replaced.  Poor little guys' front end bounces around everywhere we go.  I feel like I'm in a damn go-kart all of the time.  I do, however, enjoy tooling around corners at about 20MPH above the suggested speed.  Damn I love good handling vehicles.  After so long of driving the BaronBomb I've forgotten how nice it is to be able to take corners at a decent speed.  The dumbest things excite me, I know.   I saw two old friends this weekend.  On Friday night I saw my friend Susan.  She played first chair sax in band; she was a fellow band dork.  She always covered my ass during concerts as I would freeze up and totally not play half of the damn song; good thing I didn't pursue a music degree!  Susie and I exchanged emails and we've already emailed each other. On Saturday night I ran into my friend Jaime; she and I were really close when we were in 4th-6th grades then she moved away (please, she moved from East Canton to Louisville~7 whole miles) and we lost touch.  I ran into her at BP of all places.  We exchanged numbers and will get together soon to catch up on stuff.  It's going to be weird hanging out with people I knew in high school.  Turtle and Jenny are the only people I still talk to from school; weird how that works out, isn't it?   All in all this weekend was pretty damn good.  Woohoo!

      I am so my father's daughter.  I checked my Mom's oil yesterday before we went buzzing off to nowhere.  After I checked her oil I was going to snag some stuff out of the evil LeBaron; gotta get it cleaned out totally prior to it going away.  Well, as usual, I forgot to get the stuff out of my LeBaron.  Tonight, after she got home from work, I went out to check the oil again.  There's my LeBaron key under the hood of her car.  My Dad used to do that shit all the time; he'd be checking something on my car and leave the screwdriver under the hood, or the funnel.  One time he actually left the empty oil bottle under the hood, and slammed the hood on it.  As I said, I am definitely my father's daughter.   Well, at least now I know where my BaronBomb's key is.     OK, that's all.

      Woohoo, I have the title for my GTI!  I drove down to WV yesterday (Monday) and drove home today (Tuesday).  I'm picking him up tomorrow (Wednesday) and getting him legal as well.  I guess he needs front end work (struts and stuff), but as long as I don't drive like a maniac I'll be OK for now.  The guy who sold him to me may go fuck himself.  Good shape my ass; bought a new truck and don't need the car my ass.  But I'm not bitter...   I'm home until December 1st!  The Type O Negative/Cradle of Filth show is Friday at the Cleveland Agora.  I can't wait!  The show at the Metropol in Pittsburgh was canceled as the Metropol is closed!  That sucks more than anyone even knows; I loooooooooved the Metropol.  I'm hitting the Pitt and Detroit shows, even if I have to drive myself to them.     Nothing else is going on.   Nighty!

      Today was interesting.  We pull up from going Wal-Marting and there's a State Trooper parked on the street in front of the building next door.  I don't know what happened, but you've gotta do some shit to have a Statie knocking on your door at 10:30 on a Saturday evening.  I do not live in the ghetto, it's a very nice area actually, but some of my neighbors sure are ghetto.   I'm currently reading a book entitled  urlLink Mad In America  ; I highly recommend it.  It's about the treatment, or mistreatment rather, of the mentally disturbed.  Good reads, get it now!   I love Snapple Kiwi Teawi and Snapple Lime Green Tea.   I am a dork.   The GTI will once again live Tuesday afternoon (new battery and new rear brakes).  Now if I could only find the title I would be in business.  I'm 99% sure the title is in Glenville; what the hell was I thinking taking the GTI title to WV???   I finally got my cell phone straightened out.  The Sprint guy in Belden Village gave me an extended life battery and a new desktop charger, for free!  Thankfully that seems to have fixed the dying phone problem.  My cell phone is once again operational.  Woohoo!   Psychotropic drug companies (Eli Lilly and Janssen) are evil.   Call T & T tire so they won't ask me for anymore of your contact info.  (You know who you are.)   OK, that's all for now.

      Apparently people have taken to reading my blog then reporting what they've read to others.  Too bad, I refuse to censor myself.  That's the point of having a blog/journal; to say what I like.  If you don't like what you read, click on the "X" in the upper right hand corner of the browser.   Yes, I have been gone for a while due to my StinkPad dying on me.  I have since replaced the StinkPad with a  urlLink Gateway computer  ; I broke down and bought a 2.4Gig Celeron MooTop and I love it!  I saved $200 by buying the Celeron and it's so much better than the StinkPad was.  The stats are as follows: 2.4 Celeron, 512 Ram, 40 Gig HD, 24X DVD/CD-RW drive and a bunch of other stuff that doesn't mean anything to me.  I love this computer!!   The GTI should be fixed by Wednesday; woohoo!  I'm feeling squirrely about driving him certain places, but oh well.  Shit happens, and I'll be so happy to have a dependable car again; I'm not going to know what to do!!   Is anyone else irritated by the MCI Neighborhood commercials?  The singer guy sounds like he has a mouthful of shit.  Stop trying so damn hard to sound "soulful" and sing like a normal person.  It's a long distance commercial for godsakes.   Type O Negative at the Cleveland Odeon on Friday November 21st!  Cradle of Filth is closing the show; I've never seen them live but I do enjoy their music so I'll stick around for their show too.  Then it's more TON/COF in December; one show in Pittsburgh (not at the Metropol; they closed!) and one show in Detroit.  That will rock!   School is pretty much shot to shit due to my inability to get back to WV.  I missed one whole week during the Queensryche fiasco in October, and I'm going to wind up missing almost two weeks this time.  What's really pissy about it is I had straight A's in all of my classes, and I'm going to pay $6300 (loans) for nothing.  Dammit!  No point in getting all worried about it though, as it's out of my control.   Halloween turned out to be quite fun.  Sherri, Christi, Candi, Sarah, Jess, Angie and I went to the Glenville graveyard to visit Sis Lin and to check things out; mind you this is around 12:30 in the morning and we stayed there until almost 3AM.  We were going up the nature trail and I got really weirded out for some reason.  Everyone who knows me is aware that I don't scare easily.  I hightailed it back to the fountain in the middle of campus; Christi and Jess were waiting there on the rest of us as they didn't want to go on the nature trail with us.  They both said I was white as a sheet when I exited the woods, which I totally believe.  I saw something in the woods that night that I can't explain. We went to the Weston Sanitarium on Saturday for a ghost tour.  That was cool as hell, and some weird shit happened there too.  I'll post some photos and the videos I shot at the Sanitarium into my  urlLink Yahoo briefcase   so everyone can see them as well.  Sarah and I enhanced some of the videos and photos and there's some really freaky shit in them.  As soon as I remember to email Sarah for them, I'll upload those photos into my briefcase as well.     Tomorrow is Friday!  I plan on doing some mall crawling at Belden Village and generally messing around.  I need to pay my cell phone bill, and mail out my eBay refunds as well.  Two months and the damn post office hasn't contacted me regarding the insurance claims I filed.  I have to refund over $400 out of my own pocket even though it's the post office's fault the packages were lost.  The PO sucks!!   I am getting rid of the BaronBomb.  I can't get legal plates on it as the car is still in my Dad's name and it is still overheating.  I just paid $500 to have a new radiator and water pump installed and it still overheats!  It's actually worse than it was before I had that work performed.  I HATE THAT CAR!  Soon I will be Baronless and it will feel nice!  My insurance will also drop another $50 a month.  I haven't seen $50 a month car insurance for a long, long time.  It'll be a nice change from $153 a month insurance.  Six of my eight points came off of my license so that helped too (dropped it from $153 to $103/month), but getting the BaronBomb off of my insuarnce policy will be great.  This is the smartest thing I've done in a while; too bad I didn't think of it before my Dad plunked $3000 into an engine!   OK, that's enough of an update for today.  More later!

      Ugh, I can't keep my eyeballs open.  I'm so tired all of the time; it's quite irritating.  I'm still sick, but I'm no longer so crappy feeling that I have to take any kind of over the counter stuff.  I just have a cough and some boogies; no major thing.   I'm hoping to score some industry passes for the Detroit Auto Show.  If I'm lucky enough to get the passes, I will get to attend the show next weekend instead of two weekends from now.  That would rock!  I wouldn't have to deal with the public and all of their stupidity, and that would be nice.     I didn't make it to the Metal Sludge event at the Hi-Fi Club due to my being sick.  I didn't think all of that nasty cigarette smoke would mesh well with my already screwed up sinuses, so I stayed away from the club.  I hear it was a pretty good time, but I'm sure there will be another event to go to sometime soon, so I'm not losing any sleep over having missed it.   What is the deal with all of the fake Louis Vuitton bags that are suddenly popping up from nowhere?  One more fake LV bag and I'm going off.  You're not fooling anyone with your fake bag; so go home and take your crappy bag with you!   OK, I think I'm finished now.

      Well I feel much better today, but I'm still really tired.  I believe my turn for the better has a lot to do with the Aleve Cold and Sinus pill I took a couple hours ago.  I really don't care why I feel better, though, so I'm going to stop trying to figure it out!   Today is December 28th; it is 60 degrees outside.  This is spooky...   I finally changed my turn clicker bulb (no more spastic clicker!), and replaced my mini fuses with regular fuses.  I had no idea mini fuses weren't the same as regular ones; I just thought their cases were smaller.  Once my mechanic stopped laughing at me, he explained that it does make a difference and I should change them.  So I did.  LOL  I also stickered my car with a Cat in the Hat sticker and an Elmo sticker, and re-affixed my Queensryche Fan Club sticker.  It's quite obvious that my car is a chick car, and I like it that way.  I'll have to post some photos later this afternoon, after I take a nice ride in this good weather.   We went to Joe's Crab Shack last night for dinner, and it was hella good.  I had the shrimp scampi and crab balls and, of course, I couldn't finish it all so I brought half of it home.  I just finished eating it about a half hour ago and dammit it was even better than last night.     OK, I'm off...

      Well, I opened my big mouth on Friday morning and now I'm paying up for it.  I had to mouth off about having not been sick, especially with the flu floating around, and Friday night I got sick.  Within a span of 3 hours I went from feeling find to wanting to die.  I felt a little better today after I tossed back some Sudafed Liquicaps, but now I feel worse.  I'm going to take some Sudafed night stuff and try to sleep.  I'm going to the doctor on Monday, but I have a feeling it's going to be a fruitless effort. Those of you who know me well are aware of how I am when I'm sick; those of you who don't know me well wouldn't want to be around me right now, trust me!   ~Insert whining here~

      Woohoo!  My Mom gave me a check last night for the exact amount of the  urlLink Dooney and Bourke purse   I want!  It's the white purse, not the black one.  I repeat, woohoo!  I plan on going to the mall tonight to get it; I am too excited.   I'm going to use my West Point Market gift certificate tonight too.  I love West Point Market!   I ate too much yesterday, and felt like I was going to hurl this morning.  Now I'm OK, but I know to not eat 3 pieces of ham then go to bed.  I learned that lesson please and thank you.   I'm waiting on the mailman now; a record player that was supposed to be here in time for Christmas will probably arrive today.  I love the postal service.   I'm going to do something in order to waste time until I go to Summit Mall and get my purse!  I am waaaaaaaay too excited about a purse!

      Woohoo!  I got the cutest  urlLink metal VW sign   for Christmas!  Now if I only had a garage...  I also got a  urlLink Porsche magnet   and a  urlLink Without A Trace DVD  .  I looooove Without A Trace; mmmmmm, Anthony LaPaglia.  This is a single episode "screener" DVD that you can't buy in the store.  Ain't I special?  LOL  I received various other sundries that I'll post tomorrow.     Speaking of posting, I'm posting a 30 second video clip of Mikey the Cat being hella cute with a piece of ribbon.  I used my digi cam's video feature, so sorry for the shabby quality.  It's better than no video, though!!  OK, here's a  urlLink Mikey photo   and the  urlLink infamous Mikey w/ribbon video.    Enjoy (those are Brian's toes, not mine, in the video)!

      Here's what really makes me mad:  You try to help a friend out and they take advantage of your kindness.  Then they get pissed off when you take neccessary measures to become "whole" again.  Do what you're supposed to do, when you're supposed to do it, and everything will be fine.  Fuck around and things will not be fine.  Isn't that simple to understand?   On a happier note, I finally got my Christmas present put together, and most of my crap put away.  This is good.   Training for my new job is tomorrow from 9AM-11AM then I start the 11th of January.  Woohoo!   OK, I'm off.

      On the way home from the Falls (Cuyahoga Falls/Akron) last night there was a car overturned on RT 8; that rocked.  It was worth the 15 minute wait in traffic just to see the moron who managed to flip her car.  I've been told I drive like a Kennedy, and even I've not managed to flip my car.   My Mom got me a new dresser thingie for Christmas.  It took an engineer 2 hours to put the general frame together; imagine me trying to put it together with my total lack of patience.  Parts would have been flying.  I do get to put the drawers together sometime tomorrow; this is going to be fun.   I got the MooTop's CD-R/DVD Drive fixed last night.  Do not ever buy a Gateway product as their service techs, salespeople and customer service all sucks.  If you must buy a Gateway, buy it from 1-800-Gateway and ask for extension 75769 (Josh).  Josh kicks ass!  He is the only reason I bought the MooTop.   It's cold right now, but it is supposed to be almost 50 degrees Monday and Tuesday.  This is good as I'm tired of running around in flannel pants, angora socks, boots, a sweatshirt, a hat, earmuffs, gloves and my heavy Ferrari coat.  I prefer warmer weather, and I need to get out of Ohio until the end of May/beginning of June.  Ugh!   For everyone who emailed me, Raffy-dog (Minerva Dave's doggy) is fine.  Missing one toe, but fine nonetheless.  Cancer free as well.  Woohoo!    Not that anyone cares, but my nose is running and I'm tired.  Off to bed I go.

      I'm such a bum.  We got home last night from WV around 6:30PM, and I was in bed by 9PM last night.  I woke up to my Mom cackling on the phone around 10PM, then was back asleep by 10:30PM or so and slept until 7:30AM.  I got up, went to the potty then went back to sleep until 11:15AM.  Ah, sleep is nice.     All of my stuff is now home.  Now I get to put all of my stuff away.  This will be fun.  (Learning how to not use sentence fragments.  Sheesh.)   I'm off for now.

      Woohoo, guess who got a job?  I did!  And the interview actually took long enough to make it worthwhile; I was there for an hour and 15 minutes.  I don't start until January 11th and I'll be out of town every Monday-Thursday.  But they pay is excellent plus they pay $15 a day for food money!  Rock out!   I forgot to mention this interesting little tidbit.  On my way home from interview number 1, I nearly hit a Jackson Township cop.  Actually I was putting along below the speed limit (and that's a good thing) when the cop pulled out right in front of me.  I called him a fucking prick and gave him the bird.  I rock!!  Dickhead...   Obviously I am not in Fairlawn having my MooTop repaired.  Obviously I am a slacker.   My car makes me hungry, therefore I'm off to find food (don't ask).

      I seriously hate interviews.  I got up at 8AM, left the house at 9:15AM and arrived at the interview around 9:50AM.  I was in the interview for 10 minutes, then drove another 35 minutes home.  All of that time (2.5 hours) for a 10 fucking minute interview.  I repeat, I hate interviews.   What does "postal money orders only" mean to you?  Does it mean it's OK to send a non-postal money order?  Sheesh.   Another interview at 1PM, then I hope to actually get up to the Gateway store and have my CD-R/DVD combo drive replaced.   Once again, I hate interviews.

      I had to open my big mouth, didn't I?  Seems that I do have that new flu; I didn't know it caused digestive pyrotechnics as well as a headache and general feelings of ickiness.  Bah!   My interview is rescheduled for 1PM tomorrow so that means I have an interview at 10AM then another one at 1PM; at least they're close to one another (location wise).  I'll hang out at the mall and hit the used record store in between interviews.  Oh, the life of a dork.   Heehee, the cordless phones on Knight Rider are huge!  Ah, the 80's.  How great they were...   I need Tylenol or Advil or something.  I'll be back later.

      Wow, I managed to catch some type of stomach bug.  I repeat, wow.   I know to never again spike Kool-Aid with Smirnoff; I've been up with heartburn since 7AM.  This day has not begun on a good note.   I hope Raffy-dog gets through his surgery OK.   It's snowing, and it may stop at any time.  I give it permission to stop right now.   I was just looking at my Type O Negative tattoo; Hammer Tattoo really jacked it up.  It's all faded and crappy, plus it's raised up out of the skin.  I know to never return to Hammer which is why I stick with (no pun intended) Kirk at Kustom Culture tattoo in Tallmadge, OH.  He used to be at Tattoo Alley in Akron, but he opened his own shop in Tallmadge because he's that good!  I need to visit Kirk; I'd like a new tattoo.   My tummy is grumbling but I'm afraid to eat.  Grrrrrr.  At least I don't have THE flu that everyone seems to be getting.  I've heard it's horrible this year.  I usually get strep, a cold and the flu all at once so I'm not upset about being left out of the flu loop.   I'm rocking out to the Scorpions.  I had forgotten how good they actually are.   Does everyone enjoy my new blog schematic?  I like it a lot better than the old look; it has more personality and personality goes a long way (what movie is that from?).     Well now, isn't that interesting?  The lady who is interviewing me at 1PM just called; she has the flu and needs to reschedule my interview.  That works out quite well though, so I'm not upset!  She's "checking her calendar" then getting back with me.     Can everyone tell I'm hella bored?  Thought so...   Since I no longer have an interview today I'm going to lay down and try to not have my throat eaten by stomach acid (nice mental photo, huh?).

Lets see, tomorrow I have an interview at 1PM then I hope to get up to the Gateway store in Fairlawn/Akron and have the CD-R/DVD drive in my MooTop replaced.  That's all I plan on doing tomorrow.     Ugh, I'm so tired but I need to clean up my room.  Don't you hate when you have a ton of crap to do, but you're just too tired to do any of it?  Blah.

      I spent too much time on the Net earlier today; it was raining by the time I got outside, so there was no decorating of the GTI today.  I had to run to the post office, then I went to the half-off store to find coffee for my Mom.  I found some interesting flavors really cheap, then came home.  Now I need to tidy up my room, but I'm putting that off.   Mmmm, hot chocolate.  Mint hot chocolate to be exact.   I need to wrap a few stray presents; I'll be back later.

      Sorry I haven't updated this thing lately; I've been busy doing nothing.  I went to WV on Saturday to pick up my crap, and couldn't fit it all in the car.  I get to go back on Friday to get the rest of the stuff.  Hopefully it won't snow like it did Saturday; that was hella fun to drive home in.  The trip took 4.5 hours and it should only take 3 hours (the BaronBomb took longer since I couldn't go over 50MPH due to the overheating).  I'm driving down on Friday and driving back on Friday; won't that be fun?  I can't go tomorrow as I have an interview and I can't go Thursday as I have an interview and a dinner party on Thursday night, so that leaves Friday.  I can't stay overnight because the dorms close at 5PM on Friday.  Bah!   It's almost 50 degrees today!  I am going outside to decorate the GTI as soon as I'm finished with this lovely post.   OK, I need to get off the computer while it's not raining; lots of shit to do with the GTI.

      OK, it's official.  I'm addicted to  urlLink this tea  .  I know, I really should find something better to be addicted to, but for now it's that tea.     Today was a boring day.  I slept until 1PM, then I popped out of bed and wandered down to the living room to sit in the recliner collect dust until 5PM when I hopped in the shower.  Then my Mom and I went to Sprint to get my phone turned back on.  While in Belden Village we went to Kohl's and World Market, then to Wendy's for supper.  That was the extent of my day.  Now I'm watching The Amityville Horror on USA, and trying to decide when to go to bed.  I believe it shoud be quite soon as I have a tiring weekend ahead of me.  Detroit tomorrow, then WV on Saturday.  I guess I'm driving to WV and returning home on the same day; won't this be fun?  My moving team (OK one person) has to be home all day on Sunday so we're going down and back on Saturday.  That's going to suck.   OK, I'm off to bed.

      OK, Sprint PCS is becoming my enemy.  I called Sprint on Tuesday as I received my invoice for November and it said I had a 31 cent credit.  I wanted to make sure I really didn't have a bill due for December, how that happened I don't know, so I called to confirm the fact.  The lady at Sprint told me I don't have a bill this month, so I was all happy and shit.  Well Sprint just shut off my damn phone!  I called and some guy told me I have to take my receipt in from my payment in November, then they'll turn my phone back on.  Argh, this is pissing me off!   I'm watching Valentine on TBS, but I think I'm going to bed.   Night all.

      The landlord was here all day (from 11AM-9PM) fixing the bathtub/sink.  It's still not finished, so I couldn't take a shower today.  Needless to say I feel grimy and didn't leave the house at all.  Bleh!   Friday is TON in Detroit day!  Then Saturday I'm going back to school to pick up all of my shit.  I think I'll piss with the remaining roommates too; won't that be fun?  Those kids made my life hell the whole time I was down there, so I hope they fuck around Saturday night and have a drunken party.  I think a nicely placed call to the police would be a fitting revenge.  I believe only 2-3 of them are 21 so it would be quite funny.  Mwaaahahahahaha...   Yes, I am an ass.   I'm off.

      Blah, bleh, blah...   That pretty much sums up my weekend.  I was stuck at home Friday night due to the snow, then I was stuck in Akron on Saturday night due to the snow.  I came home around 10:30AM and shoveled some of the parking area, took a nap from Noon-5PM and pretty much did nothing.  I did tidy up my room and rearrange my CD cases though, so it wasn't a totally wasted weekend.  I need to make a snowman tomorrow before it gets "warms up" on Tuesday/Wednesday (in the mid to upper 40's) and all of the snow melts.  Since this is the only snow we're going to have this winter (someone's a bit too optimistic), I should make the best of it.     I really should check the oil in my Mom's car.   My room smells good.   I'm sleepy so it's off to bed for me.

      Double woohoo.  The Crow just started on TMCXW; tonight must be my lucky night.  It means I'll be up until 4AM, but it's not like I have anything to do tomorrow (Saturday) anyway.     AOL has decided to seriously suck.  It keeps shutting down, kicking me offline and now the AOL browser refuses to work.  I guess it's a good thing I use SBC/DSL as my main connection, isn't it?

      Dammit, it snowed today.  When I say it snowed, I mean it really snowed.  I took a photo of my  urlLink poor GTI  , and of the  urlLink trees/bushes behind our townhouse  .  As you can see, it snowed (didn't I already mention that?).  That's OK though, as the CD Rom for my MooTop won't be in until Monday anyway, so I didn't have to be in Akron for anything.  The good news is it's supposed to stop snowing tomorrow morning, so I should be able to get out of the house tomorrow sometime.     Why did I not get to bed until 6AM?  Why did I get up at 1PM, after flopping around all night (morning) trying to sleep?  I need to buy a new bladder as I wake up every 2 hours or so to pee.  Nice, yes?   Nothing else is going on.  We could put up our Christmas decorations today, but they're over at the storage thing in East Canton, so I guess that's out now isn't it?     OK, I'm off.

I'm watching Joy Ride for the second night in a row.   I need to take a roadtrip somewhere, anywhere.  Snow and winter may suck ass.

      Yeah, I haven't updated this thing in a while; too bad.   Last week I received an email from some guy in the UK claiming he wanted to buy my GTI.  Back and forth we went, until I gave the guy my address and phone number so he could send me an American cashier's check via Fed Ex.  It's now 3 days later, and surprise, surprise the check hasn't arrived.  It wouldn't be that big of a deal, but I found a 91 VW Corrado G60 (supercharged) that would have been within my budget had that ass sent the cashier's check.  Even the fact that I won't get the Corrado is OK, but the Corrado owner was going to be nice enough to sell me the car at a huge loss just because I seemed so excited about the car, and he could tell I'd really have taken care of the Corrado.  People really piss me off.  I was so excited about getting a Corrado G60, and I should have known better than to trust some asshat from the UK (no offense to any non-asshats from the UK).  Now I have a headache...   I have a "working interview" at Cashland tomorrow morning at 10AM.  I don't know what I'm going to do for a car if I get the job; I can't take my Mom's car to work if she has to be at work that day as well.  I love my GTI but he needs a lot of work before I'd consider him dependable.  I haven't driven anywhere in the GTI for almost a month.  I'll go out and start him up every other day or so, and he runs fine, but I'm afraid to drive him anywhere.  This sucks.   I'm going to watch Smits then take a nap.

      OK, then.  I copied my addresses and phone numbers into my new day planner.  That was yesterday's activity.  Sad, yes?  Actually yesterday was an interesting day.  I woke up at 7:30AM as I had an interview at 10:30AM.  I puttered on the Net for a bit, and then went to take a shower.  I pull back the shower curtain and there's water in the tub.  Like, icky water.  Turns out the tub was messed up again, and I could not take a shower.  Rather than go to my interview quite gamey, I called in and explained what was going on.  I've rescheduled my interview for 3PM on Monday.   The landlord was called immediately upon my finding the nasty tub situation, and he arrived around 11:30AM.  The tub was fixed around 7PM last night.  Argh!  I sat at home all day, but it's not like I can go anywhere anyway, and I actually had shit that needed to be done.  Oh well, I'm up early today (obviously) so I can get shit done.  Jesus, I'm rambling aren't I?  I watch the Barrett-Jackson auction last night; were most of the bidders fucking drunk?  A 57 Bel Air went for over $100K!  I repeat, were most of the bidders fucking drunk?!  I did notice most of the asshats had their cell phones glued to their fucking heads the whole time they were bidding.  What, they have to be told how much to bid and what to bid on?  Whatever happened to personal choice and personal expression?  If I'm paying $100K for a car, no one is telling me what to buy!  Holy hot fuck, I'm up early enough to watch MST3K!    On a more interesting note, some guy from the UK wants to buy my GTI.  He offered to send me a cashier's check for $5,000, but I kindly explained to him that I cannot accept any form of payment from him other than a direct wire transfer.  Apparently that's pissed him off as I haven't heard anything from him for a day or so.  Oh well, the car (97 Golf GL) I was going to buy to replace my GTI (as if that could really happen anyway) has been sold.  People are strange, and they usually wind up bothering me!  Once I get plug wires for my GTI he'll be good as new (except for the leaking tranny seal, bad struts and bad master cylinder).    It's cold and I hate it.

      I've discovered the joys of  urlLink CKY  !  There was a song on an episode of Jackass (shopping cart skit) that's really jammy, but I didn't know who it was.  I happened upon the CKY website today and was listening to their audio files.  Wouldn't you know, there's the Jackass song!  CKY is a really good band; I'm shocked!   Another interview on Friday; this one's at 2:30PM.  Cuyahoga Falls City Hospital has an opening for a switchboard operator.  It's 24-30 hours a week, $9.85/hr.  That would rock.  I really need plug wires as I have no idea how I'm getting to this interview.  I can use my Mom's car for the 10:30AM interview, but I won't be able to use her car for the afternoon interview.  Hopefully I'll figure something out.   I didn't do jack shit today.  I woke up at 10:30AM, watched NYPD Blue from 2-4PM, took a nap from 4:30PM to midnight and now I'm watching NYPD Blue again.  If it weren't for Smits I don't know what I'd do.  LOL   Bleh

      Well, I'm not going back to the car museum.  Turns out the owner decided he doesn't want to do eBay anymore so I'm shit out of luck.     I'm enjoying watching Jimmy Smits smack some guy around on NYPD Blue.   It's relatively warm outside so I think I'll fiddle with my car after NYPD Blue is off (4PM).   It takes a special kind of idiot to break into a police impound lot.  I'm just saying...

      I really, really need to get plug wires for my car.  I'm not accustomed to sitting around the house, and that's what I've done for the past week and a half.  Other than Detriot and Wal-Mart on Sunday, I've not done anything.  It was nice to get out of the house yesterday for my interview, and I did buy some Kraft Green Box spaghetti too.  Woohoo!   I am so ready for Spring.  Not just because of car shows, but because I'll be able to get outside and move about without freezing my ass off.  As most of my loyal readers know, I love tinkering with my car and that's pretty hard to do in the cold, with numb hands.  I found a new grille for my car, and power mirrors, but I'll have to wait until Spring to install the mirrors.  I may have my mechanic install them, but I'll probably wind up doing it myself.  I can switch the grille now because it's quick and easy to do.  I'm still searching for the quad round headlight grille, to no avail.     I have yet to get a damn fish.     I think I'll do some laundry today, at the very minimum my clothes.  I can wash the comforters at home, but it's going to take me all day to wash 4 comforters.  Oh well, it'll give me something to do.

      People who confuse me suck.  People who drop off the face of the earth suck.  People who make me think one thing and then mean/do another suck.   The car museum people still haven't called me, so I went on a job interview today.  I got a "callback" for Friday morning at 10:30; I'm the best.   OK, I really don't have anything to say so I'm going...

      Woohoo, the auto show was pretty good.  Aside from all of the usual asses who walk in from of me when I'm trying to take photos, there weren't too many asshats there.  The photos with people in them are due to the dumbasses either walking in front of me or standing in the fucking way.  The asses in the Cobra photos were standing there for 10 minutes.  I stood behind them for 10 minutes hoping they'd move, and they didn't.  How rude is that?  There was no need to stand there for 10 fucking minutes.  The car's not going to do a trick; get out of the way!  Even the people in the Ferrari area were more considerate, and Ferrari just unveiled the 612 Scaglietti for the gods sake!  Photos may be viewed by clicking  urlLink  here  .  See how easy that is?  When viewing the photos please remember I'm only 5'3" so it's hard for me to get really good up-close shots in a crowded area.     I've moved on to a different tea.  Twinnings Black Currant is still good, but  urlLink this   is even better.   It snowed and that sucks.

      I am dead.  I've been up over 30 hours without sleep, and I am going to fall over.  Even my old stand-by Cherry Kool Aid won't enable me to awaken long enough to reply to emails (if I did reply to you, feel very special).  OK, it's off to bed for this car nut; photos and babble will be forthcoming tomorrow.   Nighty all!

      As you've probably noticed, I totally jacked up my blog's color scheme.  That's what happens when I fuck with my blog at 4 in the morning.  Yeah, I just didn't go to sleep tonight, so I'm sure shenanigans will occur within the next 4 or 5 hours.  Add to that non-sleep the fact that my neck and back are killing me, and you have a sure bet of shenanigans.  Why you ask?  One word:  ULTRAM.  That stuff knocks out my worst pain, but it makes me sooooooooo loopy.  Add to it the lack of sleep and I'm going to be one fucking barrel of monkey's later on today.  Woohoo!  So if you happen to be at the Detroit Auto Show and see some chick running around with a VW bag on her head, it's me.  I'll have on my red  urlLink Ferrari   team  urlLink  shirt   and my black/red patent Docs (photo to your left).  Believe me, you'll know it's me when you see me.  I rock...   I found my ultra kick ass  urlLink Icee straw  ; now I'm happy.   Mmmm, Cherry Kool Aid for breakfast.  Woohoo!

      OK, the problem of how to get to the Falls was cleared up by my happy ass being picked up at home instead of driving up there.  Now if only I could go to sleep.  I don't need to get up until 8AM, instead of 6AM, but getting up requires one to go to sleep.  Argh!   It's cold and snowy; two of the things I hate with the fires of a million suns.  How chipper do you think I am?

I have to be in Cuyahoga Falls by 8AM tomorrow (Friday) morning in order to go to the Detroit Auto Show.  First I have no idea how I'm supposed to get there, and second, how am I supposed to be up at 8AM?  Just a question....   Argh!

      Yeah, I finally fell asleep at 8AM and I woke up at the ripe time of 5:30PM.  You'd think I'm a stripper from the hours I'm keeping.  Anyway, I'm going to try the sleeping pill thing again tonight, and I'm setting my alarm for 9AM.  Instead of taking the normal dose of 2 pills, I'll only take one.  Now if I get up at 9AM I'll be in business.   I'm still arranging my room.  I just brought my computer up here from the living room, but now I have no space for my printer.  I'll have to move my stuffed animals and find them a new home, as they currently reside in the printer's spot.  I hate having so much crap!   Alright, I'm getting IM'd out the butt so I'd better go.

Woohoo me.  Sorry about the crappy quality, but us beggars can't be choosers.  I reapeat, yummy!   I hate when my glasses get all smeary and gross.  I clean them, then they get all smeary again.  Grrrrrrrrr.   I think I'm going to try sleep now.  I'm off...

      What's it like to sleep normal hours?  Hmmm?   I'm watching Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers on the Mystery channel.  I'm not sure if that's a regular channel, or an Encore movie channel.  If it's one of the movie channels the movie won't be edited to hell.  If it isn't then this movie is going to blow ass.  If it's edited I'm going to watch my FearDotCom DVD.  I don't care what anyone says, FearDotCom is a good movie!   Tomorrow will be more of the same; pissing around the house time.  Yay.

This is seriously fucked up, and needs to stop pronto.   I couldn't take the GTI to my mechanic today as it's raining and my car doesn't run for shit when it rains thanks to the crappy plug wires.     OK, I'm off to go to the post office, and grocery store.

      As usual, my plans didn't work out as planned.  I don't know why I bother making plans with anyone, as the other person always changes their mind.  Assholes.  Now I'm supposed to hit the Detroit Auto Show on Friday and on Sunday; I'm not holding my breath though.   Tomorrow will be another busy day.  Why can't I learn to spread stuff out over the week instead of cramming everything into one day?  Grrrr...   I didn't really do anything this weekend worth writing about.  Fun times were had by all, well by me.     I'm finished.

      I ran around like a crazy woman today.  I woke up at 1:30 yesterday afternoon, and didn't go to bed until 5PM this afternoon.  I'm pretty tired of this funky sleep schedule I'm on, and I'm hoping to remedy it soon.  I'm really tired now, so I plan on going to bed no later than midnight.   Here's the news I was babbling about earlier in the week.  I'm going back to the car museum!  I'm too happy.  I don't have my start date yet, but it'll be relatively soon.  I am sooooooooo happy.   I ran to the dry cleaner's today as I managed to jack up the zipper in my Ferrari jacket, so I need that replaced, and I also called my repair guy about the record player I purchased as a Christmas present.  The record player doesn't work at all, and I'm sooo pissed about it, so I'm going to get an estimate on having it replaced, then send a copy of it to the jackass seller.  That's the second Christmas in a row that I've been screwed  by purchasing gifts off of the Internet.  I've learned my lesson, and won't do it again.  Of course the seller claims the record player worked when he shipped it; what a lying jackass.   Tomorrow is evaluate the plug wires and coil day.  I need to rustle up a spray bottle so I can diagnose my problem.  I'm taking the GTI to my mechanic on Monday at 10AM so he can go over it and let me know what its overall condition is; all for no charge!  I know I definitely need new struts ($600), a new brake master cylinder ($80) and new plugs/wires ($135).  I also need the transmission seal replaced ($100) as the dumb fucks who originally replaced the seal clipped it when the installed it so now it leaks.  Asshats.   Detroit Auto Show on Sunday!   Henry Rollins spoken word performance on Valentine's Day at the Agora in Cleveland.  Woohoo!

      Well I originally was asleep by 10PM, but I woke up at 1AM and haven't been able to get back to sleep.  Bah!   Today is fishy day!     I got the neighbors pretty good this evening.  I went upstairs after my last post and began tidying up my room (no it's not finished yet).  I cranked a mix CD up to about 16 and let the sonofabitch play.  The CD has Gary Jules, Depeche Mode, Type O and some hair metal on it; quite the mishmash to fuck with annoying neighbors who listen to rap music.  About an hour and a half after I went upstairs, I came downstairs for a drink and noticed it was silent next door.  They were still home so either the landlord's wife called and told them to shut the fuck up, or my stereo got the message across.  My Mom told me the music was so loud this morning (around 10:30AM) that she was going to come upstairs and yell at me to turn my stereo down!  I repeat, fucking crackheads...   I'm going to change purses then go to bed.

      I'm in a crabby mood, and the crackheads next door aren't helping it very much.  Lets turn our stereo up as loud as it'll go, and slam into the fucking wall.  I called the landlord again today, and his wife agreed that they're way too noisy and it's passed the ridiculous stage.  The guy has 7 fucking kids and doesn't work.  His crackhead wife lied to the landlord and said she only had 3 kids; she has 5.  Stop fucking reproducing!   I need a nap.  Besides, two can play the "turn the stereo up as loud as it will go" game and my music is more annoying (well to most people) which means I win by default.  The asshat next door is playing rap music so odds are he's not a Type O or Queensryche fan.  Speaking of Queensryche,  urlLink Michael Wilton   is one of the sexiest things I've ever laid eyes on.  Add to the fact that he kept gesturing at me, and smiling at me, during the QR show in October and I'm transfixed!  The photo is courtesy of his website,  urlLink www.MichaelWilton.com  .   That's it, the fucking music is so loud it's like it's in my goddamn living room.  It's time to be childish and retaliate.

      Here's what really pisses me off...Don't email me wanting to buy a pair of my Docs, then suddenly change your mind and not notify me of your decision.  I understand that things may come up, but at least have the decency to let me know you won't be purchasing the shoes from me.  People never cease to piss me off.   On a similar note, don't make plans with me then decide not to follow through with those plans and not let me know.  If you don't feel like doing something, let me know.  I, of all people, understand that sometimes a person just doesn't feel like going anywhere or doing anything.  Then this person bitches when she can't find good friends, and can't find a boyfriend; gee I wonder why quality people want nothing to do with her, and why she can't keep a boyfriend?  People quickly tire of being the only one making an effort to have a relationship with someone; romantic or platonic.  If your follow through on plans is zero, your social life will quickly follow suit.  Goodness.   I'm hoping to get my fishy tomorrow.  Maybe having a cute fishy will calm my happy ass down.   My room is almost straightened out!  I'm so close to having it back to normal, I just want to finish it tonight.  I need to start going to bed before 4AM, but I am staying up tonight until my room is finished.  Hopefully I'll be in bed by 1AM.     OK, it's under 10 degrees here.  Fuck you, Ohio.  Fuck you.  Speaking of the cold, I was outside for not even 10 minutes helping my Mom carry shit to the curb for the trash pickup tomorrow, and now my ankles and knees are killing me.  Arthritis is not fun, no sirree.   I'm trying to figure out how to transfer data from my old Compaq to my MooTop.  The Compaq doesn't have a CD burner, nor does it have USB ports.  It does have a floppy drive, but my MooTop does not have a floppy drive.  I think I'm going to have to break down and bust out the old zip drive in order to get everything transferred.  It'll really piss me off if I go through all of that trouble and then the MP3 files won't play.  Grrrrrrr.   Alright, I'm finished bitching.

      Who in the hell is calling my house at 20 til 3 in the morning?  Of course the number came up as private name/private number; fucking crackheads.   I felt much better today even though it was still raining.  It's now supposed to turn into snow; I'm so excited.  I'm tired of Ohio and really need a change of scenery, even if it's just for a week's vacation.  Uck.   I talked to Don, my mechanic, today and he said he's pretty sure it's my plug wires.  That makes me feel better, as I didn't want to deal with electrical gremlins.     I repeat , people who call me at 20 til 3 in the morning are fucking crackheads.

      Wow, I feel like crap.  I've had a headache since I woke up this afternoon, and it will not quit.  I sincerely hope to feel better when I wake up tomorrow morning as I have to stop by the car museum, call my mechanic (he wasn't in on Saturday), run to UPS, call the local domestic violence coalition to find out about volunteering and go to the post office and the bank.  None of these tasks will be completed if I feel like I did today.  Ugh...   My Mom found my old Compaq laptop.  It was packed away in the basement so I'm amazed it still works.  I managed to rig the power cord so that the battery will charge; that's why I stopped using it.  One of my "friends" tripped over it and broke the connection.  I had it fixed once, but it still didn't work right.  The laptop has all kinds of Knight Rider wav files on it, and some amusing photos.  It's sooooooo slow, though.  It was the best you could buy in 1998 and now it is a worthless PC.  It's fun to play with though, and I'm definitely keeping it.  I can get on the Internet via dial-up, but it's not advanced enough to support SBC/DSL.  It'll be a good backup just in case the MooTop decides to die on me.   I'll stop blabbing now.

      Well I replaced the coil wire on my car, yet he still chugs.  I'm calling my mechanic tomorrow (Saturday) and finding out what he wants me to do.  My car will chug, then fix himself and then chug again.  And it only happens when it's been raining.  Snow doesn't cause it, nor does regular sunny or overcast days.  Hmmm...   I didn't get my fishy tonight, but I will buy him soon.   I may have really ultra-awesome news to post soon.  I should know by this time next week, and as soon as I find out I'll post it.  Either way, good or bad, I'll post the news as soon as I find out.  I hope it's good!   I busted out the Atari this evening and played games for a good hour to hour and a half.  I was too dorky happy to be sitting in front of the TV playing the original Frogger game.  I kicked ass on Missile Command and Dig Dug, but I got my ass kicked on Pac-Man and Moon Patrol.  I love Atari!   I miss Fluffy.   I managed to score my Keith Haring day planner for 2004.  I couldn't find it at Border's prior to Christmas, but there were three of them there tonight, and all for half-off!  Rockin, I say.   Alright, I'm going to finish watching Copycat on TNT.

      Blogger was working fine earlier today, but now it seems to be down again.  Until Blogger gets back up like normal, all of my Blogger hosted images will not be working.  I hope they get this crap fixed soon.   I've packed up everything that needs to be shipped, and I'm going to finish my Avon order now.     I'll finish cleaning my room tonight in order to prepare for my new fishy!  I'm buying a Siamese Fighting fish tomorrow, and I want to make sure my room is all arranged before I bring him into the house.  I know, it's just a fish, but I want to make sure everything is arranged so he doesn't accidentally get knocked over or something.  I was going to get a goldfish because they're so cute, but I don't think I could handle another pet dying right now.  Siamese Fighting fish live through anything, so that's my new pet!     I watched "Wrong Turn" last night on DVD.  It's not that great of a movie, but it is pretty funny.  Pick it up if you're not doing anything else; it would also be a good party DVD.  All in all I'd watch it again, and I'd buy it for $7 or less.   OK, I'm off...

      OK then.  Happy Leap Year Day or something.  It's taken me this long to recover from Friday.  Here's a rundown of the shenanigans that commenced as soon as Jenny and I left my house: 8:15PM-ish Jenny arrived and we leave. 9PM-ish we arrive at El Campisino in Massillon for alcohol absorbing food (2 cheese enchiladas for me, of which I only ate one.) 10PM we arrive at Jenny's bar selection; Little Country.  She enjoys this bar as they have Karaoke and we were on a skank hunt.  As Jenny said, to find a skank one must go skanky for the night.  This bar sucked ass, please and thank you.  We each had one Zima and decided to leave. 10:45-ish we arrive at Party's bar which is actually called Iron Tales Saloon.  I've known Party for years and met him through my ex-husband.  Party realizes it really  is  me sitting in his bar and comes over to harass me.  He gives me hell for not coming out last summer for his outdoor concerts, and proceeds to get me up to date on all the happenings.  Turns out one of my old friends from those days wound up dying from AIDS.  She started shooting up and caught the virus that way.  I wish I had known she was sick; I could have visited her as she was always very nice to me and never did anything like shooting up around me. Party then proceeds to tell me this was the first Friday in ages that Crypt hadn't been in the bar; he had to work.  I'm supposed to come back when they get back from Daytona (bike week) and see all of the old buddies.  These are all older biker guys and for some reason I'm very comfortable with them.  I would even go into this bar by myself as everyone is really nice, and I know most of the people.  Anyway, Jenny and I were asked to go home with two guys, one guy told me I have nice boobs and another guy told us he would have bought all of our drinks be all of his money was in the bank (yeah, right).  And one other guy told us not to drink all of the Smirnoff Ice as they only had a case left.  LOL  I had quite a list of beverages at Party's; 5 or 6 Smirnoff Ice 2 White Russians 1 shot of Tequila Rose (all they had left) 4 Jello shots (3 watermelon and one orange)  I didn't puke, nor was I hungover on Saturday.  I  was  tired though as I got 2 hours of sleep on Thursday night and I didn't sleep on Friday night.  I caught a nap from 2-4:30PM on Friday afternoon, then I slept from 10PM Saturday night to 9AM today.  Woohoo!    Sorry, off track.  Jenny and I left Party's bar at 2:15AM or so then drove to Taco Bell in Canton South.  We then drove to Jenny's house where her husband made fun of us for about an hour.  We stayed up talking until 5:30AM then they went to bed and I sacked out on the couch.  I couldn't sleep though, because I'd hear a noise and think one of her kids were coming into the living room to poke my eye or something.  Her husband drove me home around noon so he could listen to a noise Jenny's car was making, and I needed to get my tired ass home.  Didn't do shit Saturday night.  Today my Mom and I went to Target, Bed, Bath and Beyond and PetSmart.  Bought new lamps at BB&B and also a new tablecloth/napkins.  I was finally going to buy a fish but the one I really liked was dead.  How nice.  They had no red guinea pigs, so we didn't get one.  Woohoo!  Oh yeah, my sister and nephew came over from PA for the first time since my Dad's funeral in June of 02.  I'm not even getting into that tonight.  K, I'm off.  Hopefully I'll have hella good, and cheap, news in regard to the GTI tomorrow afternoon!!  That is all.

      Waiting on Jenny...  My hair is cut by about 5".  That's OK, it looks much better now.  The GTI will be diagnosed on Monday; a computer would only be $100 used, so even if the whole computer is bad I'll still be fine. I drove him today for the doctor, but of course he ran fine.  It was hella nice today, around 60 degrees, and I guess it's supposed to be just as nice tomorrow.  Woohoo!  Need to brush my teeth.  That is all.

      Busy, busy, busy tomorrow.  Haircut at 11:30AM, job interview from 1PM-4PM then out with Jenny at 7:30PM.  I'd rather be busy than spend another weekend sitting around the house.  Good thing my Mom doesn't work tomorrow as I need to steal her car from 11:15AM-4:30PM.  Bleh.  I guess I'm not the only one spanking ass today.  Dr. Dork called me about an hour ago all happy because he'd fixed his speedometer cable.  The damn thing has been broken for at least 3 years; his car shows 136,000 miles on the odometer and it's more like 200,000 miles.  There's a Quaalude project for Saturday as well, but I've totally forgotten what it is.  Hmmm...  Speaking of cars...The GTI doctor said he'll find out tomorrow what's doing with my car.  I'm almost afraid to venture a guess as to what I'll have to pay.  I'm really hoping it's just a fuel pump, but with my luck, it'll be both fuel pumps and all 4 injectors.  Shit, why not just throw in the whole CIS-E assembly while I'm at it?  Argh!!  That is all.

      I just grabbed that HTML by the gonads and showed it who's boss.  I finally have the font I like (Century Gothic), and the page layout pretty much as I'd envisioned it to be.  I'd like for my entries to not be so snug against the table, but I'm sure I can figure that out later today.  Whee, I'm so proud of myself.  I'm going to try and sleep now.

      Heehee, I talked to Jenny today about an old "friend" of ours having another kid.  This girl gave up custody of her last two kids, yet she has another one.  Anyway, Jenny and I are going out on Friday in hopes of seeing this girl at the bar.  Yeah, we're losers.  LOL  I took a nap from 5:30PM to 11PM so I'm going to be up all night.  Yay.

      How's this for bad karma?  I go upstairs thinking I have to pee and wind up yakking my toenails up.  I know to not drink milk, yet I do it anyway.  Bah!  The GTI is now at the doctor, and he's very scared.  I need to go visit him and tell him it'll be OK as he's probably scared sitting out there all by himself.   Can you tell I have too much time on my hands?  That is all.

      Here's what pisses me off...I missed the entire Jimmy Smits death sequence on TNT!!  What the hell?  He only gets 3 or 4 episodes for the entire sickness/death thing?  Come on now!!!  Had to reschedule the interview for Friday at 1PM.  I needed to use my Mom's car today, but the interview/testing/application process takes 2.5 to 3 hours and I needed to have her car back by 1PM so she could get to work.  I did get the GTI to the doctor today; no word yet on his condition.  LOL  Where's the fucking mailman?  That is all.

      I think I may get my tongue pierced.  I've wanted to for a long time, but I'm a chickenshit.  I just called  urlLink Kustom Culture   which is where I get my tattoos, and the guy was really nice.  He said it's way better than getting a tattoo, and it takes about a second for the needle to go through the tongue.  I'm still scared shitless, though.  LOL  I'll probably punk out and not get it done, but then I may wind up getting it done!  I have a job interview tomorrow at 10AM.  If I get the job I'll be so happy that I probably will get my tongue pierced this weekend!  But then, it's not like I'm going to get a job so I guess my tongue is safe.  LOL  Yesterday...Went grocery shopping with the biddy, and then went to Family Dollar where I found the cutest Easter purse for a DOLLAR!!  Family Dollar is my friend.  Not only did I find that cute purse, but there were 4 pairs of Calvin Klein Jeans at Family Dollar!  They were all brand new with all of the tags still attached!  2 pair were black jeans, and the other 2 pair were black Khakis.  I was shocked!!  After shopping, the biddy and I stopped at the local Chevy dealer to check out the new Aveo.  It's actually kind of cute, but really cheap feeling on the inside.  The back seat is huge though, and it seemed comfy enough.  My Mom thought it was cute though, and I'm afraid of any thoughts she may be having.  Heehee!  A brand new car for $10,000!  That's too awesome!  That's all we did yesterday.  Oh wait, we went to the post office too.  LOL  That is all.

      Saw this  urlLink here  ,  urlLink here   and  urlLink here  , so I figured I may as well jump on the bandwagon since I'm not usually a bandwagon jumper.  LOL  Besides, it's a cool thingie to do...  Step 1: Open your mp3 player. Step 2: Put all of your music on random. Step 3: List the first ten songs it plays, no matter how embarrassing.  1.) AFI "Silver and Cold" 2.) Ministry "So What" Live 3.) The Gathering "Proof" 4.) Savatage "New York City Don't Mean Nothing" 5.) Mary J Blige "No More Drama" (Hey, it has the Y&R theme as they main line!) 6.) Madonna "Don't Tell Me" 7.) Fleetwood Mac "Goodbye Baby" 8.) The Gathering "Leaves" 9.) Ministry "Supernaut" 10.) Savatage "Summer's Rain"  Nothing too bad on there, I don't think.  Where's all of my Depeche Mode???  The random setting on Windows Media doesn't like me very much.

      Quickie update for now; more after I get back from the grocery store...  Drove the GTI around town; he ran great!  Tomorrow is GTI doctor day as Don told me to hold off until tomorrow.  New photos of the GTI are on my webpage; I took updated photos of the inside, the rear and updated the passenger and driver side photos.  He's dirty, so cut me some slack.  More later.    That is all.

      Yeah, I'm still awake.  Anyway, I was so bored a took a photo of my  urlLink VW Water Bottle   and my  urlLink VW Mug  .  I bought both of these items when I first purchased my GTI last May, and I was working at Pro Car.  Ah, now nice it was to have a good job!  Anyway, if you'd like to get either of these handy little items for yourself, please visit the  urlLink Dave Walter VW website   or  urlLink the main VW website  .  I buy all of my VW stuff (except parts, never buy parts from the dealer unless you have to) at Dave Walter.  They're good people, and the VW gift shop is fabulous.  The photos on the DWVW site are of the actual dealership in Akron.  The Dave Walter BMW dealership is directly across the street from DWVW, so you can buy your sweetie a VW, then buy yourself a BMW.  Anyway, just in case you'd like to buy the same  urlLink GTI Turbo shirt   I have, the  urlLink VW Mug   or the  urlLink VW Water Bottle (new style)   the links are provided for your ease of consumerism.  I would love to have this  urlLink laptop bag  , but that's a bit expensive.  I could spend all day at the VW store, or on the website.  I'm such a dork!  It's been relatively quiet next door since the police fiasco yesterday morning.  I guess the guy came back yesterday morning (late), but I've not heard him.  My Mom said she heard him yesterday before she went to work; he was screaming at the kids again.  I heard one of the kids screaming for over an hour this evening, and I heard some of the other kids, but I didn't hear any adults.  I have a feeling the landlord will be by today with a prospective buyer; it will be fun.  I'm moving out in May or June, but that's a long time to have to worry about the dirtball neighbor, and a long time to put up with his noise.  Why can't things ever be easy for me?  Even just for 6 months to a year and I'd be happy.  How about giving me a little break whomever you are????  I need a haircut and color.    I need Zyrtec as I keep sneezing and my eyes are itchy.  Is that Spring in the air???  I've heard honking geese the last 3 or 4 mornings, and I also heard birds singing yesterday morning.  Hurry up Spring!!!  I can't wait until the tulips out front start to bloom; we planted them right before I went to college in WV and they should be blooming in the next couple weeks.  I love flowers!  That is all.

      OK, this is funny.  It's almost 5AM.  Beginning at approximately 2:45AM the asscrack neighbors were slamming shit all around.  4:15AM and the cops show up outside; 3 patrol cars with 4 cops total.  About 10 minutes later an ambulance shows up and the asshat is escorted into the ambulance!  I'm guessing the woman next door beat his ass or something.  She's stupid for putting up with him, but at least she's giving him an ass kicking for being such a dick.  Although if she did beat on him she should have went to jail; no getting off just because she's female.  Anyway, I just thought that was amusing.  Maybe now it'll be quiet since he's not over there, and I can get sleep!

      The crackhead neighbor next door just proved how dumb he is.  My Mom gets home from work tonight, and there's the neighbor waiting for her outside.  He claims her car is waking up his kids, and he's going to call the cops the next time it happens.  First off, her car has a brand new exhaust system so he's full of shit. Secondly, her car is supposed to sound like that.  Lastly, I'm sure his screaming and loud music wouldn't have anything to do with his kids not sleeping, would it?  So she told him we didn't call the cops on him earlier in the week, but if he wants to start being stupid, we will start calling the cops on him.  Then he tried to say she's never heard his music in our apartment.  Um, yes she has and so have I.  I guess the landlord called this guy and told him the "crazy next door neighbor" keeps calling to complain about the noise.  That would be me he's referring to, and I don't think he's funny.  The next time he brings a prospective buyer through the townhouse I'm going to start asking questions such as, when he plans on fixing our hot water heater, when he plans on fixing the leaking basement that was supposed to be dry and when he plans on doing something about the loud neighbors.  That will probably screw any prospective sale, and I will be delighted.  I really don't think I'm being unreasonable to request hot water, and silence at 6AM.  Or to be able to sit in my living room and read a book without listening to the neighbor's music.  Earlier this week their music was so loud the picture on our wall was shaking back and forth.  What the fuck???  This guy has 7 kids (5 of them with the woman he's currently living with), an ex-wife yet he doesn't work and sits in the house all day.  He screams at the kids, and his wife, and is generally a pain in the ass.  We didn't have nearly the problem we do now with noise before this guy got out of jail.  I also think it's odd that the kids now scream when they get baths; they used to not mind it at all (I can hear this shit through the bathroom wall, that's how loud they are).  This guy doesn't do anything, but he can give the girls their baths?  I am almost sure something is going on next door, but I don't know whom to call or if they'd even do anything about it.  I really hate people.  I can't even believe I'm having these problems, and it really sucks!  That is all.

      Argh, I hate when I find cool stuff on eBay and I know I have the same damn item, but I can't find it anywhere.  This  urlLink Doc Martens jacket  is hella cool and I know I have this jacket somewhere, but I can't find the fucking thing anywhere.  I know I wouldn't have sold the damn thing because it fit me great and is hella cool.  Bah!!!  On an upward note, I did find all of my TON concert photos while I was digging around in the basement.  Maybe that jacket is in the storage unit, so I think I'll take a trip over there tomorrow before my Mom goes to work as I have to take her car.  I hate this not having a car bullshit.

      Fags shouldn't be allowed to get married, and neither should dykes.  What the fuck???  Nice intelligent thinking, asshole.  Honestly,what is the big deal?  They're people, they love each other and want to get married.  Who cares if it's two guys or two girls?  As long as they love each other, that's all that matters.  At least I thought that's how marriage was supposed to work; silly me for thinking love was the most important factor in marriage.  I went grocery shopping today, and pleasantly there were 4 people in the store.  FOUR PEOPLE!  How awesome is that?  Usually I run into at least 3 stupid people everytime I step out of the house, so that was a nice turn of events.    It was quite warm here today, around 53 degrees, and I couldn't drive my car.  Grrrrrrrrr.  That is all.

      My goodness...I just watched a special on E! about cosmetic surgery.  The guy on there was soooooo flaming, it really was too much.  Seeing how one of my closest friends is gay, I have nothing but love for gay people.  But really now, this guy was too much.  Did anyone see this episode????  I just keep shaking my head as I was in awe of the guy.    I just heard someone drive by on their motorcycle.  Yeah, it was a hell of a lot warmer today than it's been for months, but it's not that warm out just quite yet.  Maybe that's just jealousy talking because I'm stuck in the house on such a nice day.  I did wash and dry my moo seat covers and they are now ready to be put on the GTI's seats in preparation for his resurrection.  I need to figure out how to finangle them though, as the hooky things were ripped off when I took the covers off of the BaronBomb's seats.  I was going to get new seat covers, Spongebob or Hello Kitty, but I like my moo covers and they were a Christmas gift from Dr. Dork 2 years ago, so I kept them.  I had to throw the matching moo steering wheel cover away though, as it was stretched out from the Baron's steering wheel and didn't fit on the GTI's wheel.  I have a Hello Kitty steering wheel cover, and Hello Kitty trash bags as well.  Yeah, I have issues.  That is all.

      I have had a headache for 3 days; THREE FUCKING DAYS.  Why, you ask?  Because of all the cigarette smoke at the Henry Rollins show, that's why.  I think it's so shitty that in order for me to enjoy a concert or a show, I have to be miserable for days afterward.  Yeah, it's your right to smoke but what about my right to not have to smell your nastiness, or put up with the aftereffects of the smoke?  It's been proven that cigarettes kill.  If I were out waving a loaded gun around and randomly shooting at people, would I be in jail?  Yes I would.  Why is it that smokers are allowed to be in public places waving their death sticks in my face, and it's perfectly fine?  Just wondeirng...  I'm really tired of being miserable because of other people's asshole tendencies.    On a similiar note...Piss me off and you'll be on my ignore/block list faster than you can say asshat.  Because that's what you are; an asshat.    OK, I'm finished.

      Heehee, I think it's funny that the second I mention having contacted the phone company in regard to a certain phone number, the calls stop.  It's a number based in Baltimore, MD and is a Verizon cell phone number.  At least the jackasses have stopped bothering me.  Woohoo!  On to better things...I talked with my mechanic today and he is pretty sure the GTI's electrical system, and computer, are fine; he believes the fuel pump is going bad.  This is such a relief to me as I was imagining huge repair bills due to an electrical gremlin or worse; a bad computer.  Now I just have to get the beastmaster fixed and I'll be set.  The fuel pumps are $85 each, plus labor of $50 an hour.  I don't know if he can check the fuel pumps, or if we're going to have to replace both of them to be sure the problem is fixed.  Still, it's much better than trying to diagnose an electrical problem.  Now I just have to get my tax refunds and I'll be set.  OK, I just wanted to share.

      I really need a pet.  A fuzzy little kitty-cat, preferably, but I'd even settle for some fish or even  urlLink Sea Monkeys   (probably swayed there by all the fun being had by  urlLink Mac  ).  Not to replace Fluffy, that's not possible, but to give me something to play with/chase/spoil.  I don't have a job at the moment, my car is dead and I'm stuck at home.  I need a diversion.  Someone keeps calling my house from "NCO Graphics" then hanging up when I answer.  They've called at least 15 times since Saturday, all with the same outcome.  I called the phone company this evening, and all of my incoming phone calls are being traced.  The NCO asshats call three times in 30 days, and I can press charges.  Yeah, I'm not doing anything, but it gets irritating after the 2nd call of the day.  Some people amaze me.  I'm finished.

      I can't believe I forgot to post about Hank's performance on Saturday night.  Anyway, it was pretty good, but I feel his previous performances were much better.  This performance was 3 hours and 20 minutes long, which probably had a lot to do with it as well.  Sadly, Hank just ended a 6 year relationship, however he has found a new love...Ann Coulter.  If you are unfamiliar with who Ann is, you need to stop reading my blog and start reading the paper.  Anyway, it was a good way to spend Valentine's Day, and fun as well.  Hank is always a good time, and so cute as well!!!  Hank loves me, he just doesn't realize it yet.  OK, I'm off to bed.  I finally got my music gremlin figured out on here and on my webpage, so I can now sleep.  If the music doesn't play, refresh the page and it should start up.  Good tune, I highly recommend listening to it.  Nighty.

      One more person starts bitching about the "overcommercialization of Valentine's Day" and I'm punching them.  So you're expected to buy flowers/cards/candy for the person(s) you love.  How does that differ from Christmas (buying gifts/sending cards), Halloween (trick or treating/buying candy) or Easter (more buying of candy)?  It doesn't, that's how!  Is that the trendy thing to do this year? "Lets all bitch and moan about how Valentine's Day is overcommercialized."  Let me guess, next year there will be a big Valentine's Day protest all over the US, and I'll have to put up with the stupid protest because a couple of morons wanted to make a point.  Please, if you feel like making a point at least have an important cause. I don't expect anything huge for Valentine's Day, but a Happy V-Day or a smack to the head is appreciated.  My present from Dr. Dork is my ticket for tonight's Henry Rollins Spoken Word performance at the Cleveland Agora.  Dr. Dork doesn't want anything, so that's what he gets.  In my opinion, guys who use the "overcommercialization" excuse are cheap asshats, especially if they spare no expense on shit they buy for themselves (CD's, magazines, music equipment).  That goes for guys who are in relationships only, as you obviously aren't expected to buy anyone anything if you are single.  Now for the flipside; women who expect huge, lavish presents.  Are you going to love this person any less just because he/she didn't get you the Kay Jewelers diamand heart pendant?  If so, you have serious relationship issues and need to re-evaluate your situation.  You should show your love all year around, so lets stop with the bitching and moaning about Valentine's Day.  Along the same line...One more of those fucking stupid Kay Jewelers commercials and I'm going right down to their headquarters in Fairlawn and punching the ad guy.  Pay attention to the gold-digging skanks in the commercials.  They don't say "I Love You" until after the piece of jewelry has been presented.  What's the deal with that?  Besides, if I were going to be with a man simply because he bought me baubles, they'd have to be a bit more extravagant than Kay's crap.  Have any of you carefully examined Kay's jewelry pieces?  More often than not the piece is poorly set, and is a below average diamond.  I guess what I'm saying here is, don't buy your shit at Kay's, or JB Robinson or Osterman's since they're all the same place anyway.    Alright, my little brother (OK, he's 36) is here with food.  Later!

      Watching FearDotCom on DVD and drinking Panda Berry Tea.  I'm also being grumpy.  It seems as though my GTI doesn't like me, no matter how nice I am to him.  He went from putting only when it rains, to putting all the time.  He has an appointment at the doctor on Monday, and I'm having him towed over there.  Originally I could drive him when he took one of his putting fits, but this last time he kept stalling everytime I'd try to move.  I don't know what the fuck his problem is, but I do know it's pissing me off.  The fuckwad who sold me the car needs his ass kicked.    Guess it's a good thing I can't find a job since I now don't have a car.  Jenny stopped by and brought me Valentine's Day candy.  Awww, thanks Jenny!  I haven't seen her in 5 years!  We talk on the phone at least once a week, but we never could get to one another's house.  She was out tooling around in her new car (94 Firechicken) and stopped by.  As soon as I get a car that runs, I will go see her a lot more often.  I've done nothing for the past two weeks which is why I haven't updated this thing.  When my life livens up, if it does, I'll post more often.  Off to watch my DVD, then go to bed.

      I'm currently writing "fuck off and die" emails.  If you've been an asshat to me lately, you will receive one, and they're not pretty.  I'm tired of people who take advantage of my kindness, and my willingness to help.  If you've used me as a sounding board, but not been around for me the last couple weeks, you will get an email.  So in advance:   Fuck Off And Die!

      Dave Gahan is sooooooooo gay in some of the old Depeche Mode videos.  I mean really now, have you seen them?  I'm talking about the old-school videos when he had really short hair.  It's even worse when he tries dancing.  Dave, stop.  Don't dance. Ever.  I don't care though as Depeche Mode is, in my humble opinion, one of the best bands ever.  To me, Depeche Mode is up there with Type O Negative, Queensryche and Savatage.  I know, most of you are giggling right now, but I loooooooove Depeche Mode (thanks Dr. Dork.)  Since last Thursday some interesting things have happened.  The cashier's check for my GTI did indeed arrive on Monday, however it is counterfeit.  Turns out, "James White" is part of a Nigerian scam.  I wasn't stupid enough to fall for it, surprisingly, but I didn't let the guy know I'd figured him out.  I led him on and he actually believed I sent him two Western Union transfers for $2300 each!  The guy wound up calling me at least 15 times on Monday, and the last time he called the asshat forgot to block his number.  It came up as Datasoft Net with a 314 area code.  Nice, yes?  I have all of the emails and stuff, along with the cashier's check, and I contacted the FBI.  People are dumb.  Saturday evening I had an interview at a clothing place in Belden Village.  Anyway, I thought I was being slick by going around the big snow drift.  I wound up tripping over nothing, and doing a split.  I was hugging a tree trying to not fall on my ass.  Every time I moved my right foot to try and get up, my foot wound up slipping more.  Yes, I'm a tree hugger.  I wound up having to sit down in the snow anyway, so it was all for naught.  I'm sure the neighbors got a kick out of it, though.  Sunday was a repeat performance.  My Mom and I went to Target and Wal-Mart, so I was carrying the bags in the house (Mom was making chili.)  I wound up falling again, only this time I fell on the hard blacktop that was covered with at least 4 inches of ice.  I whapped my right knee about right; hard enough that my kneecap moved and my foot went numb.  After a bit I could walk, but it still hurts to fully straighten my knee.  Is it any wonder I stay in the house during the winter???  Good fucking Christ, I'm watching wrestling.  And I just admitted it.  Goodness.  Cashland wasted 4 fucking hours of my time.  It's been almost a week since my "working interview" and I've not heard from them.  Is it obvious why I hate interviews??  I can understand one interview, but three?  And one of the interviews last 2 hours?  Come on, now.  Bastards.  My clothes are now all washed; I have to wash bedding now.  I think I have 4 comforters and 3 sheets downstairs I need to wash.  Ugh, I hate laundry.  OK, I think I'm finished now.

      Bad things happen when Minerva Dave starts talking to me about beer/drinking:  I'm getting started on the weekend a bit early, no?  Whee, don't have to go into the office tomorrow.

      Something more for me to bitch about...In my auctions I have that I accept money orders, Western Union auction payments and US cash only.  International bidders have to pay via US cash or Western Union.  The terms also state payment must be received within 7 days of auction end.  Does this mean you can use Buy It Now on my item then bitch because I don't accept PayPal?  And it also means you can take years to send payment because you have to "buy US funds" to send as payment, right?  Do people not fucking read?  How hard is this to understand?  Also, don't bitch about shipping charges when you didn't bother asking prior to using Buy It Now.  Don't try to get me to quote letter post when the packaged item will be too large to qualify for letter post.  I'm not stupid, so stop pretending you're smarter than I am.  You're not.  That is all.

      Well the GTI didn't get to the doctor today.  I called the towing people and they don't have a flatbed truck available until tomorrow.  Hopefully he'll be fixed by tomorrow evening, but if not he'll be fixed by Friday afternoon.  Again, I didn't do anything today.   urlLink Jamie   was working this evening so we're not getting together.    The unnamed person is still pissing me off.  Eat shit and die!

      Jenny and I are going out Friday night.  I plan on getting soooooooo drunk I don't even remember my name, let alone all of the people I'm pissed off at right now.  We'll be at Iron Tales Saloon in Canton; drop by and buy us a drink!  The GTI is going back into the doctor tomorrow to have his transmission seal replaced.  I picked my Mom up from work tonight then we ran back home so I could put on pants (I was wearing Adidas shorts) and so she could get her purse.  We then went to AutoZone to buy an air filter for her car.  On the way there my car started whistling/whining in third gear.  Well upon leaving AutoZone and returning home, 3rd gear started groaning and whining.  I'm guessing the transmission is either dry or close to dry.  I parked my car in a different space tonight, and I'll check for the telltale puddle in the morning.  If there's no puddle I'll be sure the tranny is the noise-maker.  My Mom is being nice and loaning me the money for my tranny seal; hopefully I'll be able to get my struts and coils soon as well, but that's a tick more expensive.  Rained all day today.  I didn't do much of anything, and it was nice.  This weekend I'm busy.  Friday night Jenny and I are going out, Saturday night I'm free and Sunday night I'm going to the Clutch concert in Cleveland.  I emailed  urlLink Jamie   to see if he wants to hang out tomorrow (Wednesday).  I hope he's free as I just sit around the house and think when left to my own devices, and that's not a good thing.  That is all.

      This works.  I guess the new plan of attack is for me to go into work for about an hour or so, then come home and work.  I'll get paid for 4 hours at home, and whatever I'm in the office as well.  I may be losing 2 hours a week, but really it's worth it.  Still in a pissy mood.  People never cease to piss me off.  It's raining but that's the one thing I'm not pissed off about.  It fits my mood.  That is all.

      An executive decision has been made.  I am raising the GTI back to his regular height.  Why, you ask?  Lots of reasons, the main reason being regular springs are only $140; Eibach springs are $240.  Plus I won't have to baby him as much over railroad tracks and I'll be able to drive down unfamiliar roads in the dark.  Right now I'm stuck to familiar roads at night as I can't see the holes in the road until I've run through them.  I know I'm going to lose his awesome handling, but I'm being practical (for once) at the moment.  Later on down the road I'll get the Eibach set.  Don's going to kick my ass when he has to keep changing the springs on my car.  I'm in such a pissy mood, you can't even begin to imagine.  That is all.

      Mikey the Cat, I am allergic to you.  You're cute, but no more cuddling.  Today I washed the GTI and my Mom's car.  The washer thing ate half of my money so there I was in the wash bay with no change to rinse my car.  He was all soapy, and I couldn't rinse him.  So I had to call my Mom and have her bring me change to finish washing my car.  Note to self, don't go to wash your car with only $2 in your pocket.  Dumbass.  The rust is a-popping out on the GTI.  I really have my work cut out for me this weekend if it's nice outside.  I detest sandpaper.  For some reason it just skeeves me out, and I hate sanding my car.  But it must be done, so I'll deal.  I kind of wish I hadn't washed him today as it just makes the rust spots more apparent.  I just downloaded the new SBC/Yahoo DSL browser.  It's even better than Netscape 7, but then again my Netscape browser has been fucking up for over 2 weeks so anything is better than that.  Oh well...  It was so warm out today.  At least 70 degrees and sunny.  I guess it's supposed to rain Monday and Tuesday, hopefully it'll be nice the rest of the week and the weekend.  Anyone know of where I can rent a Ferrari for the day or the weekend?  Dr. Dork graduates in May and his graduation present request is to have a Ferrari rented for the day or weekend.  I plan on passing this info on to his parents, and I'd like to know if this can even be done before I go to his Mom and Dad.  They were going to buy him a new laptop, so I know they're planning in spending at least $1500 to $2000 on his graduation gift.  Anywhere in Northeast Ohio is great, and I'm guessing Cleveland/Beachwood  is going to be my best bet.  Even Columbus or Pittsburgh is OK.  If anyone knows where I can rent a Ferrari in my area, please  urlLink email me  .  A picture of my GTI rim just cause it's so cool:    That is all.

      Travis emailed me today saying I need to have comments enabled in my blog.  There's many reasons why I do not, but simply put, it's because people are stupid.  I'm all for constructive criticism, but people aren't that way.  I would have countless morons posting personal attacks and I don't have the time, or patience, for such stupidity.  I always reply to anyone who emails me, and if it's that important I'll comment on the email in my blog.  If you don't like my blog, don't read it.  You don't have to agree with what I say but you do have to realize this is my space for whatever I feel like writing.  I'm feeling worse as the day goes on, but I hope to be OK for work tomorrow.  If I miss tomorrow as well, that means I'll only have a 12 hour pay.  That sucks.  I think I may order some wings; maybe that'll burn the ick out of my system.  That is all.

The cops banging on the neighbor's door woke me up again at 11AM.  I guess I'm not supposed to sleep or something.    If you're broke, don't go on trips, constantly go to bars and buy shit you don't need.  Need and want are two very different things by the way.  If you aren't going to follow these simple guidelines then shut the fuck up about being broke.  I think I'll try going back to bed.  That is all.

      Halloween 9 will be released on October 31st.  I am too excited, and it'd better not suck!  Arrived at work this morning to be sent home 20 minutes later.  Apparently I sounded like a froggy whenever I talked, and I was attempting to hack up a lung as well.  I came home, took a nap from noon to 3:15PM and I feel much better.  I'm still sneezing and boogery, though, so it's not over.  Maybe I'll see a doctor tomorrow if I'm not feeling better.  Finally remembered to make the car rental reservation for the Queensryche show; I rock.  We now have tickets, and a car.  Now all we need is for that spiteful bitch (Mother Nature) to cooperate and life will be good.  We don't even need to worry about the Columbus highway sniper anymore!!  Please tell me that's not a flu-like ache I feel in my neck and shoulder.  Grrrrrrrr.  The remainder of yesterday was spent running around town.  The doctor, then picked up Mom's car, then back home to shower, then out to eat and to K-Mart.  Today has been spent sneezing and being out of breath.  Total cost to have the Z-34's timing belt changed?  $745 including parts, labor and tax.  I guess her car has a belt and a chain, but the belt does most of the work so it's a good idea to have it replaced.  Hopefully we'll find out why her check engine light keeps coming on as well.  I'm off to find something to eat.  I'm hungry, but yet again I don't know for what.  I hate it when that happens.  That is all.

      I hate getting sick.  I wish I would just wake up sick, but oh no, it has to gradually creep up on me.  I hate  being  sick too, but I think the build-up to sickdom is worse than the actual sickness.  For those of you who heard me spazzing about my transmission, it's fine.  I was worried because I couldn't put my car into first gear until I was pretty much stopped.  Don the Mechanic told me that's because first gear isn't synchronized in my car; makes sense to me.  So now I don't have to worry about first gear being bad or something.  Also, my younger brother's friend did have his Beetle repaired at Don's, so I get a free oil and lube!  Woohoo!  I need an oil change in 750 miles (111,000 total miles), so the free oil/lube couldn't have come at a better time.    I'm off to nap until 2:30 when I have to take my Mom to the doctor.  Watch, the car guys will call at 1PM and say her car's fixed.  That's just enough time for me to get into a good drooling sleep.  Mother Nature needs to stop hitting the booze and decide on a fucking weather pattern.  Saturday it was in the 50's, yesterday it was in the 40's and last night/today it's snowing and fucking cold.  No wonder I'm sick, and everyone else I know is sick as well.  That is all.

If you receive an email from that address please delete the message as it probaby contains a virus.  Didn't go to the Dream Theater show this weekend.  I haven't felt "right" since Tuesday, and besides, I didn't see the point in spending the money for parking and tickets, only to see 2 or 3 songs that I like.  I am definitely going to the Clutch show on April 4th in Cleveland, and the Queensryche show April 18th in Columbus.  Tickets have all ready been purchased and all that good stuff.  Now it's Monday and I'm finishing up this post.  I started this post, then went to lay down and didn't get up until 8:30 this morning.  I've felt kinda sick for almost a week, and now I know I'm getting sick.  My ears are clogged up, my head is boogery and I'm coughing.  I NEVER cough unless I'm sick.  I'll be miserable for work tomorrow, this I guarantee.  Oh yeah, my throat is getting sore too.  How fun.  Over the weekend I finally found the two Bonham CD's I've been searching for.  The Disregard of Timekeeping and Mad Hatter.  Yeah, I'm excited.  I have to run my Mom to the dentist as her car is in the shop today.  New struts are a good thing.  That is all.

      I just answered the phone.  "Silver Eagle and Auto Connections, Lisa speaking."  Please allow me a moment of excitement.    At least I'm getting paid to surf the Net, and to update my blog.  That's good, I guess.  I do have to phone a client after 5PM this evening, so that little task will be performed from home.  I rock.  Lets see, yesterday was an "eh" day.  Went to Alliance to apply at Goody's, but the application place was closed.  After that I ran all over the country trying to find the original Halloween on DVD.  K-Mart had a 25th anniversary 2-disc thing for $25, Wal-Mart didn't have any Halloween DVD's and Sam Goody had the same thing as K-Mart only $5 more.  How hard is it to find a regular old Halloween DVD for under $15?  Obviously harder than I thought.   I also checked out Bath and Body Works' new spring stuff, and I was suckered into buying a  urlLink lilac candle set thing  .  It smells really good, but since it makes me sneeze I'm returning it.  Shame really as the candles do smell good. Wal-Mart warranted 2 boxes of Kraft Green Box spaghetti, 2 Hershey's mint chocolate cookie bars and Black Dog on DVD.  I love Patrick Swayze, I can't help myself.    I looked up a Zip Code, I rock.  I've done two work related things today.  I can't stand being at work with nothing to do, and there really is nothing to do.  The kitchen and bathroom areas are tidy, nothing needs faxed or shredded and I have nothing to print or look up on the net.  Bah!  I'm off to do nothing for another 2 hours.  Kill me quickly.

      Ugh, I feel like I'm going to hurl.  I ate a turkey sammich around noon, and have felt pukey since 1PM or so.  Maybe some Kool Aid will help me feel better.  OK, I understand people are excited about the St. Patrick's Day parade tomorrow, but was a press conference really necessary?  It's Cleveland, the weather always sucks, get over it.  People are dumb.    Woohoo, it's supposed to be 41 on Friday and 52 on Saturday!!  Is it ever going to end?  Where is the sunshine?  Where's the sandal weather?  Hurry up Spring!!!!  Still no tax refund check.  I loathe the US Postal Service.  I was supposed to get my tranny seal replaced on Friday at 11AM.  I told my Mom to please not schedule her car repair until after 1PM on Friday; she agreed and the subject was dropped.  I got home from work today, and there's a note on the entertainment center.  She made the appointment for 9AM on Friday.  Hello, did we not discuss that yesterday?  So I had to cancel my tranny seal appointment as I'll have no way to get home from the mechanic, and my Mom will have no way to pick up her car.  How hard would it have been for her to have scheduled that for after 1PM?  I should be used to this kind of shit, but I'm not.  I'm guessing I'll reschedule the tranny seal project for next week sometime.  Hopefully my transmission doesn't blow up before I get the seal replaced.  Dammit.  My cold sore is almost gone.  I guess Valtrex really does work!  Why is it that everytime it snows, there are all kinds of wrecks?  It snows every year in Ohio, what's the fucking problem?  Don't drive like a moron, and you won't wreck.  That's pretty simple, isn't it?    I think I'm finished griping for the time being.  That is all.

       urlLink Some people are so stupid.    Honestly now, it's a crappy Mustang and he needs to learn how to A.) Spell and B.) Properly format numbers.  Willing to trade for a Beetle and cash?  I bet his is.  Besides, that's not a trade, that's a partial trade.  As Steph would say, fuckwad.  That is all.

      Driving to work this morning sucked.  The roads were pretty bad if I'm slipping and sliding around in the GTI mobile.  It snowed really hard for about an hour, then stopped and it hasn't started back up since.  It didn't snow enough to get me home early, so it needs to not snow at all.  I'm now off to print out ads.  That is all.

      Hello, my name is Lisa and I'm a lip balm addict:    urlLink Click to enlarge    I counted my lip balms today, or at least the lip balms I have in that drawer.  I counted 82 lip balms, and I know I have at least 20 more in purses, my car, etc.  I'm currently sporting a cold sore so I'm only using my "pot" lip balms, that way I don't get the rest of my lip balms infected with germs.  I just have regular lip cold sores, not the icky "other" herpes.  Even so, it's hella embarassing to fill a prescription for Valtrex pills and Valtrex cream.  I made sure to point to my cold sore and say "I hate when I get COLD SORES on my lip".  The girl just grinned and kind of nodded her head like she understood I don't have an STD.  I know how much I hate cold sores on my lip, so I can't even begin to imagine what they'd be like anywhere else.  I feel sorry for anyone who has the herpes STD, especially women who get it from being raped, or from their husbands being unfaithful.  OK, I'm finished talking about herpes!  I was washing clothes this evening and one of my bras managed to jump in the washer and dryer (I usually wash them by hand in the bathtub, dry on the table).  The bra was all mangled and had choked one of my Happy Bunny socks.  Thankfully the bra wasn't ruined, as it's one of my favorites, and my Happy Bunny sock survived too.  I hope it does snow a lot tonight/tomorrow because if I have to work a full day tomorrow I'm going to be tired.  I need to go to bed!  That is all.

      Almost forgot, Mother Nature has been upgraded from a cunt to a spiteful ass-licking cunt.  We're supposed to get some huge snowstorm beginning around 4AM and going until 11PM tomorrow (Tuesday) night.  All I know is, I'm not driving to work if the roads are bad and I hope my boss understands.  I'm also not staying at work until 3PM if the roads are beginning to get bad.  I'm not a doctor so I don't need to work when the roads are bad.  I've never understood people who will risk their lives driving on really bad roads for some office job.  If you're a doctor or a nurse or something, I understand.  But an office worker?  The papers will be there tomorrow.  The weather people are calling for 8-16 inches, if not more.  This sucks ass.  That is all.

      Just another example of how shit always happens to me.  My Mom's federal tax refund arrived today, mine didn't.  They were supposedly printed and mailed on the same day, so where is my fucking refund?  Just an example of how shit always happens to me.  I'm not whining, I'm just stating facts.

      Guess who won a song from the Pepsi/IPod thingie?  I did.  I rock.  Tomorrow is Monday which means I have to work on Tuesday.  Don't get me wrong, it's great to have a job again but it's so damned boring!  A new store in Carnation Mall is opening soon and I'm thinking of applying there as well.  Retail won't be so bad as long as it's no more than 2-3 days a week.  Besides, can we say "employee discount"?  I'll have to apply, then see how much they pay, what hours they offer, etc.  You never know...  It's confirmed.   urlLink Jamie   and I are going to see Queensryche in Columbus (Newport Music Hall) on April 18th.  Woohoo!  I'm soooo excited.  My last QR fiasco resulted in my being late for the show and only catching the last hour of their performance.  That was also the evening before Fluffy was put to sleep, so I wasn't in the cheeriest of moods to begin with.  This show will be much better and is almost 6 months to the day from the last time (October 17th) I saw QR.  Again, woohoo!  Hopefully I'll score soundcheck and/or meet and greet passes for this show too!  Type O needs to tour this summer.  My car needs a bath.  Fingernails are not to be used as screwdrivers.  I almost bit a chunk off of my tongue Friday night.  I was eating a sucker and bit down on the tip of the sucker.  My tongue was in the way and was almost removed from my body.  I manage to hurt myself during most any activity, and now even while eating.  I love digging through my lip balm drawer (yes, I have a lip balm drawer).  It's like going shopping without spending any money, or even leaving my room.  I found my Mark Lip Lights in tangerine, but I couldn't find the other two flavors.  I need to dig through my lip balm drawer after I finish my laundry.  That is all.

      So far I'm ahead in the GTI VS Prelude poll.  Damn right!  Thanks to  urlLink Jamie   I now want  urlLink this chair  .  Thanks so much Jamie.  Found struts for the GTI at Summit Racing.  KYB self adjusting struts for $40 each!  I should be able to save up and have them installed by early-mid May.  Woohoo!  That's a lot cheaper than $180-$200 a strut!  It needs to warm up so I can get to the bodywork on the GTI.  He also needs a bath pronto.  Hope it's warm next Friday so I can get a ride on someone's bike.  Jenny and I are going out again Friday night to Party's bar and most of my old friends should be there.  All of them have motorcyles.  Jenny and I are such trollops.  That is all.

      Goodness, I'm certainly on a sugar kick as of late.  I've been killing Black Cherry Kool Aid and rootbeer Bottlecaps candy.  I had to buy Wyler's Black Cherry drink mix today, and it's nowhere near as tasty as the Kool Aid brand.  I think I'll protest if Giant Eagle is out of the Kool Aid brand this weekend.    Drove my car to the grocery store, and around town so he could warm up fully prior to my returning home.  He runs fine, finally.    My AOL mail is still all jacked up.  Hopefully no one is trying to get in touch with me.  Bleh.  I've been lazy on returning emails that are sent to my sbcglobal account.  If you've emailed me and I've not replied, I apologize.  I'll return everyone's emails tomorrow after work.  K, I'm off.  Have to finish up my laundry then it's CSI/Without a Trace time.  Then it's time for bed!  That is all.

      First day of work was today.  I'm really going to enjoy this job!  I spent my day searching online auto ads, seraching for car shows and eating at Burger King.  I have to try and design a flyer to hand out at car shows.  Anyone who knows me is aware that I have zero artistic talent.  This is going to be interesting.  On the way to the auto show Saturday, I saw this:   What exactly happened to this Mustang???  And I thought the BaronBomb looked bad!!  If you've emailed my AOL account and I've not replied, please email me again.  The last couple days I've had problems with my AOL account.  I'll click on an email to open it, and AOL will freeze.  When I log back on to read the email, it has vanished.  I'm not ignoring you, I just didn't get the email!  That is all.

      The GTI runs fine.  Finally, he's OK.  Not quite as fast as before due to a missing Oxygen sensor (fucking up the air/fuel mix or something), but he runs really well.    Saw the first 4 episodes of the Soprano's 5th season; they are awesome!  David Lee Roth has a cameo in the 4th episode.  How awesome is that?!  Some good quotes from the first 4 episodes:  Do you want a fucking apology?  Whitman's Sampler? (Tony) Go shit in your hat! (Uncle Junior) Oooooooooooh! (Pauly Walnuts) He's still twitching, this one.  (Chrissy)  Many more that I can't remember.  If you don't have HBO, get it.  I don't have HBO, but I can watch the series screener  tapes so it evens out.  LOL  That is all.

      Whee, I worked today from 4PM-7PM and it was nice!  I arrived at work around 3:15, but we didn't leave until 4, so I didn't get paid until 4PM.  That's OK, though, as it was a lot of fun.  We photographed a 1956 Thunderbird in Peacock Blue (think teal) that was in very good condition.  The guy selling the car was nice too, so that made the time go quickly.  I start my regular Tuesday/Thursday schedule on Tuesday, but I have a feeling I'll be doing listings a lot sooner than I'd first anticipated.    The GTI ran fine and scooted right along.  I caught air on a bump in the road!  That wasn't fun, and I do not plan on going airborne again.  I rock, by the way.  It was soooooo nice today.  Thankfully I was outside, and able to enjoy the 78 degree weather.  It's only supposed to be in the 40's tomorrow, which sucks, but it's better than freezing or below.    Cleveland Auto Show tomorrow, then plug changing and various other GTI tasks.  I have to take a drive on the ho track too (Arlington in Akron) as the hos may have rotated since I was last up there.  Heehee, the dumbest things entertain me and Dr. Dork.    I'm burning a CD then it's off to bed; gotta be in Cuyahoga Falls by 1:30 tomorrow afternoon.  That is all.

      It's 76 degrees today.  OK, if you're in Florida or California that's no big deal.  I'M IN OHIO.  I am going to roast on my first day of work.  Yes, I'm going in today for a couple hours.  Chris (the bossman) and I are going to a customer's house to photograph a car for sale.  My first day on the job and I'm all ready doing the fun stuff!  Woohoo!  I really think this job is going to be a lot of fun, and there's a lot of money to be made outside of my regular hourly wage.  I can't wait!!  My first payday is the 19th, but it's only for one week.  Ick!  The drive to work will be my first "trip" in the GTI since he came home.  Of course I'm a bit apprehensive about driving him because of the trouble I've had with his chug.  But if Don says he's fixed I will try to be optimistic.   The wind has me worried too.  It's windy as a sonofabitch outside; my car is little and light.  I'll be blown across the street!  OK, gotta go change then leave for WORK!!  That is all.

      Shit, I totally forgot to update about my car.  Duh!  Anyway, I picked him up yesterday around 4:15PM.  Don called yesterday morning soooooo excited because he'd figured out the GTI riddle.  Turns out the dumb asscrust who sold me the car is a complete stupid fuck.  When he changed the header (yeah, the GTI has a "performance" header) he ripped the oxygen sensor out of its little cubbyhole.  Well he twisted the wires all together, then twisted the wires around the swaybar.  There they sat, shorting out everytime they got wet and grimy, or everytime they touched each other.  So Don fixed all that up and only charged me $53.25 (he worked on my car for at least 3 hours)!  I drove my GTI home and drove my Mom to the dollar store last night; he ran fine.  I do believe he's fixed.  Don stuck him on the scope thingie, and the engine code thingie; all is well.  The coil is fine, as are all of his other operating systems.  Now I need new struts, the tranny seal and a master cylinder to have a good as new GTI.  I'm having the tranny seal replaced in 2 weeks, when I receive my tax refunds, and I'll probably have Don do the master cylinder too.  Then all I'll need to replace are the struts, and that's going to wait for a long while.  Oh well, at least he's running again and being cute and stuff.  I do need to replace my driver side body trim thingie; the grey piece that runs along the door.  It fell off when Don opened the door last week.  Nothing a little alcohol and 3M adhesive won't fix.  LOL  And I need to change the plugs on Saturday as well.  There's nothing quite like changing the plug wires, and not changing the plugs too (it was 5 degrees outside, come on now).  Heehee!   Confirmed "upgrades" to the GTI: Performance header/exhaust (Brospeed) Neuspeed springs (3" lowered) Tokico rear struts~adjustable Neuspeed strut brace bar thing Special cams (plural as it's a dual overhead cam engine)   I would like to get Recaro seats, new front struts (obviously), some ignition thing Dr. Dork was babbling about earlier this evening and a new paint job.  Around $3500 and I'll have him just as I'd like him.  That is all.

      OK, now it's supposed to be in the mid-70's tomorrow!  Rain is likely, but mid-70'S!  Yeehee!  Got a new cell phone today, and a new phone line in my room yesterday.  It's been phone week or something.  Start my new job tomorrow, but I only work from 3-5.  We're going on an appointment to photograph a car that's being put up for sale.  My first day and I get to do fun stuff!  The bossman may want to take my GTI instead of his Infiniti, though, as the GTI is pretty pimping.  LOL    Not doing anything tomorrow other than work 3-5; Saturday is the Cleveland Auto Show.  That'll be fun.  I may even drive the GTI to the auto show, we shall see.  OK, I'm off to bed and hopefully I'll sleep until at least 9AM.  Last night I went to bed at 10PM and woke up at 2AM.  I was up until 5AM then slept until noon.  What the hell?  I had an appointment today to get my eyebrows waxed, but I totally forgot about it.  I was scared too, so that may have had something to do with my memory lapse.  I suck.  That is all.

      Holy hot fuck, it's supposed to be 66 degrees on Friday.  Woohoo!  Right now they're calling for rain, but who cares?  66 degrees!  Yes, I am awake at 20 til 6 in the morning.  I went to bed at midnight, then woke up at 4AM with insane heartburn.  What the fuck???  I think I'm OK, now, so I'll try sleeping again.  Have to be up at 11AM just in case the phone company guy is actually on time.  I'm getting my phone line installed today sometime between 11AM and 3PM.  I decided I'd break down and get my own line, with voice mail, so I don't have to worry about not receiving my messages.  I also have unlimited long distance for $20 a month which comes in handy since 98% of my friends' phone numbers are long distance from my house.  That's always nice.  I smell a car wash for the GTI in my near future.  I'll even wash my Mom's car; sure why not?  That is all.

I'll only be working Tuesdays and Thursdays to start, but it's $9/hr so it's better than nothing.  Besides, I'll work more this summer when I begin doing listings on my own.  Right now I'm responsible for the data entry, dictation and customer contact portions of the business.  In a month or so I'll be comfortable enough to start collecting the vehicle data, taking photos and approving cars for sale.  I will have the power!!!  By the way, I'll get paid to attend car shows.  Now who's the pimp???  The GTI has a bad coil and will be home by the end of the week; hopefully Thursday at the latest.  Going to bed.  That is all.

It does get a bit tedious, but a quick trip to the potty or to get a drink, and I've ready for more.  LOL  My GTI is too much.  I came home from work today and turned him off.  No big deal except the fan keeps running after you turn the car off.  How I love VW's!  I'm getting another fucking cold sore.  What the hell is going on here?  I guess I shouldn't complain too much though, since some people get cold sores 2 and 3 times a month.  But still, stop with the ickies.  Nothing interesting happened today, so I'm off to mess around for a half hour or so, then go to bed.  That is all.

No more trying to find the USB cable in order to upload photos.  No more burning CD's when I want to print photos at Wal-Mart.  I say woohoo!  Seriously, you should have seen me when I figured this out.  OK, maybe you shouldn't have.  LOL  I'm off to bed soon; gotta work tomorrow noon to 6PM.  That is all.

LOL  I figured out how to get the music to play with a Mozilla browser.  I rock!  Seriously, I'm too proud of myself.  OK, I'm off to scrounge up some food.  That is all.

      Google's new Gmail service is cool.  Thankfully it works even when sbcglobal and AOL are down.  I really hate the Internet sometimes.  It is snowing.  In April.  I hate Ohio.  Again Dave Gahan.  Don't.Dance.Ever.  I called about my check from Auto Connections and no one answered the phone.  It would be nice if I could be paid, especially since I was supposed to get paid last Thursday.  Chad was supposed to call me yesterday so we could go over what I did, and so he could mail my check, but he had to go out and take photos so he didn't call me.  This is beginning to piss me off.  No one has to be there when I get my pay.  I have a key, which I need to return anyway, plus I need to pick up my desk stuff for my new job.  Grrrrrrrr, I want my money!!!  How am I supposed to send refunds, mail packages, buy gas and refill prescriptions if I'm broke?  I repeat, grrrrrrrr.  I am assured of a check on the 7th, though, so this is good.

      I just talked to Denny from the car museum.  I'm going with him on Monday to solicit donations for the June car show.  We're going around to people who donated last year and asking for donations again this year.  It'll be fun, and get me out of the house.  Plus I'll have the inside scoop on all of the show's door prizes, woohoo!  The Stark Cross-County Cruise-In is June 5th, all day.  I'm working the sport compact thing this year, so I'll be downtown all day long, and during the evening too.  I will enter the GTI even though he's not going to be repainted; I don't care.

      Heehee, I chased a goose today.  Mom and I went to Gabe's to look for shorts.  Well there were two geese in the parking lot, so I proceeded to chase one of them with my Mom's car.  The goose just ambled a little faster; didn't even fly away!  I'm amazed by the weirdest things.  I'm trying to figure out when I bought my GTI.  I know it was in May sometime; I'm thinking around early May, but I'm not sure.  Hopefully I wrote it down somewhere, I'll have to check.  The title isn't any good as I didn't have it transferred until November.  Hmmm...  I must see the movie  urlLink Mean Girls  .  It comes out on Friday, and I have to work until 7 or 8PM.

Oh well, I'm more interested in my icon at this point, and if I need to check my background music I can always open up Navigator, Explorer or my SBC browser.  Wow, I have way too many internet browsers!    The favicon doesn't show up using Mozilla Firefox.  Just thought you'd like to know.  My Mom is making me watch some stupid Hallmark Hall of Fame movie; hopefully the torture ends soon.  Must wash my car tomorrow.  I finally straightened out my videos and DVD's.  Not much to say tonight.  That is all.

      OK, on my sbcglobal profile I kindly request people to not bother me unless I know them.  At least once a day some stupid guy messages me and bothers me.  When I tell him to fuck off, he gets all belligerent and shit; like I messaged him in the first place!  It never amazes me as to how dumb people really are.  I was just looking through the classifieds for a job; I forgot I finally have a good job!  Dumbass.  I should get my last Auto Connections pay on Tuesday or Wednesday; Chad is calling me tomorrow to go over what I've done, and go over my hours.  That will be good as I'm broke right now, and have a few things I need to mail/take care of.  It would have been nice to have been paid over a week ago, like I was supposed to, but I'm glad to finally get that wrapped up.  I still have to collect my things from the office, and return the office keys, but I can do that anytime really.  Need to wash a load of laundry.  Damn, it seems as though I'm always doing laundry!  I really need to carry the 3 totes of shoes to the basement as well, but they're too heavy for me to carry.  Dr. Dork was supposed to carry them downstairs on Friday, but of course he "forgot".  Ass.  Travis just linked me to Mozilla, so I'm gonna try it out.  Maybe then my favicon will show up!  That is all.

      Whee, I have an URL image!  I can't get the image to show up using the SBC/DSL browser, nor will it show up with an AOL browser, but it does show up with a Netscape browser!  Check it out, it's a little VW icon.  I'm so happy!  Went to 4 places yesterday looking for Meguiars clay detailer thingie.  Finally found it at K-Mart but the clay bar was missing.  Sucks to be Dr. Dork.  Berryclear Sprite Remix is even better than the Tropical kind.  Go buy some now!!  I'm off for now.  That is all.

      Another guy called today to offer me a job.  I like my current data entry job, so unless this other job pays at least $10 an hour, I'm not taking it.  I rock.  I worked today, that's it.  Went to Wal-Mart too, but nothing exciting happened.  The GTI is a pimp ride.  That is all.

      OK, I'm going to like this job.  There's enough variety so I don't lose my mind, and I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH CUSTOMERS!  I don't really have to deal with anyone, and the people I have talked to all seem really nice.  The freakiest thing of the day is a girl I work with sold me a CD on eBay almost 2 years ago.  What's even more strange is she remembered me!  Anyway, I guess I'm only working 3 days a week, which is cool but also sucks because I was looking forward to that extra $45 a week/$180 a month.  Oh well, at least I have a job that'll keep me busy. I cropped photos today, and entered some ads.  Hopefully I didn't fuck up too much stuff for Heather to have to fix, or else she'll kick my butt!  Heather graduated a year after me, which means she's younger than me, but she's really nice and helped me a lot.   My desk at work is being overrun with little brown ants.  Not a good thing! Amended work schedule: Wednesday-Noon to 6 Thursday-Noon to 7 Friday-Noon to 8 (Or whenever we're finished) I'm off Saturday through Tuesday, woohoo!  Enough work stuff...  It's been rainy and gross all day which is cool cause I'd be pissed to have to work with it being nice out.  Hopefully it'll be nice this weekend.  My sister called and left a message on our machine.  I guess my nephew is in ICU at Pittsburgh Children's Hospital.  He has pneumonia and his kidney stopped working.  This is the nephew who just got a new kidney a little over a year ago (Christmas of 2002).  I really wish shit would stop happening to him so he could just be a normal kid.  Thankfully all of my other nieces and nephews are healthy, but why did Matt have to get all of that shit dumped on him?  If anyone says it's to make him a stronger person, they're getting smacked.  He's 11; he doesn't need to be a stronger person, he needs to be a kid.  Must pee, then hydrate myself.  That is all.

      I start my job today.  The girl called at 10 til 11 and wanted me to start at noon.  Sorry, can't start until 1PM.  So I work today 1-8 and tomorrow noon to 7, or whenever we're finished.    Bleh.  That is all.

      If you drop your razor while in the shower, don't grab it by the sharp end.  Moron.  Per usual I didn't organize the videos or DVD's.  I'm such a slacker.    I don't know if I'm working tomorrow or not; I guess it depends on when my drug test results are in.  Maybe I won't start until Friday; that would rock as I really need to get my last paycheck.  It's all ready a week late.    Gotta get my clothes out of the dryer then go to bed.  That is all.

      I start my new job tomorrow, Thursday.  My drug test results didn't come in today and I can't start until they have those results.  I'll get paid on May 7th for a week and two days.  I can't wait!  Today I've done nothing so far.  Well I did plop a load of clothes in the washer, but that's about it.  I have to run $26 to Don, then get gas.  I will organize my videos and DVD's today, yes I will!  Supposed to rain, but that's OK.  That is all.

      Yeah, here's an observation.  The Queensryche Fan Club is supposed to be a group of like-minded folks, right?  Well my experience on Sunday is that they're asses.  I can't really explain it other than the Columbus group is like a high school clique and no one else is allowed to join.  It was obviously my first soundcheck thing, so why not help me out?  I should have known they were asses when I posted a question in the Forums and it was completely ignored.  People are fucking stupid.  Today I had my drug test for my new job and I picked up my car.  I also returned the headlight switch to Kempthorn VW with a minmal amount of lip from the service guys.  I was amazed, I really was.    I have low beam headlights, and a tranny that doesn't leak.  My car no longer smells like cat piss when I shift a lot!  It's amazing!  Hot damn, I think I just found Proof on Kazaa!  If you're not a fan of The Gathering, you should be.  I also found Roads to Madness by Queensryche.  Tonight is the MP3 search night!  I was in bed, but since I went to sleep at 6PM, I guess I'm probably finished sleeping for the night.  I think I start work today, but only if my drug test results are back.  If I do work, I'll get off at 6PM, so that's not too bad.  Thursdays are the long days; noon to 8PM.  It'll be nice to have a job where I actually have work to do everyday!  Goody's is still the pimp store.  I just realized, the Columbus QR show was my first road trip for the year!  I love road trips, there's something about rest stops and highways that get me chippy.  I'd like to make it to  urlLink Fallingwater   this year, as well as the  urlLink Carlisle car show  .  I'm sure I'll figure out other places to travel to as well, but those are the two that popped into my head at the moment.  Shit, Carlisle begins Wednesday!  I must go this weekend!  I've been wearing shorts, short sleeves and flip flops.  And sleeping with my window open.  Ah, Spring.  That is all.

      According to the Chevy owner's manual, and as read to me by  urlLink Jamie  , the heavier the rain the harder it is to see.  Also, snow and ice in your tires may cause your car to slide.    Yes,  urlLink he   was reading the Chevy owner's manual while on the way to Columbus.  Seriously, all of you go outside and check out your owner's manuals.  There's some super silly shit in there!  Again, the heavier the rain the harder it is to see.  Brilliant!  That is all.

      The Chrysler 300C.  Have you seen it yet?  This car is pretty OK, even though it is a Chrysler.  Very cool looking, plus you can get the Hemi engine which schleps the car from zero to sixty in 5 point something seconds.  I wouldn't buy an American car, but it is very nice, at least what I've seen of it.  Yes, that's my big discussion.  LOL  Cut me some slack, I'm tired and going to bed soon.  Total bill for my GTI is $23 and I have low beam headlights!!  That is all.

      Just talked to Don.  The VW dealer gave me the wrong part, and I didn't need it anyway.  Apparently there was a loose wire under the dash and that's why my headlights aren't working.  Also, the tranny isn't leaking, it was just a little bit too full.  I didn't need a new seal for the other side, saving me $83!  Don rocks.  That is all.

      Things To Do: Arrange videos and DVD's. Wash a load of clothes. Take out the trash. Call the trash people and arrange to have them pick up the old microwave. Hang up clothes.  I can't get to my drug test until tonight as my car isn't finished and my Mom had to work today.  Thankfully the place is open until 10PM, so I'll go as soon as my Mom gets home from work.    My left arm was sunburned yesterday, and I'm happy about it.  I have a watch mark on my left arm so I know I did get some sun.   urlLink Jamie   and I arrived in Columbus around 3PM, but it took us 15 minutes to find a parking place.  We stood around at the venue until about 5 after 5, then went inside for soundcheck.  Soundcheck was about 25 minutes, then we were escorted back outside.  We walked around for a bit, then went to Starbucks so I could pee, get something to drink and sit on my ass for a while.  We sat in Starbucks from 10 after 6 to 15 after 7, then we headed back to the venue.  After standing in line for about 20 minutes we finally got inside.  We sat in the balcony and the show rocked out.  The opener, Symphony X, was awesome!  I'm going to say they're a cross between Savatage, Dream Theater and Faith No More, with Rob Halford for a lead singer.  I was seriously jamming out. Queensryche came onstage around 9:15 or 9:20 and played until 11:20.   urlLink Pamela Moore   is phenomenal, which made the Mindcrime Suite even better.   Drove home and got here around 2:30AM.  Took the rental back and was in bed by 4AM.    I need more sleep.  Later today: Lisa Discusses The New Chrysler 300C!  That is all.

      Busy weekend.  Lets see, Friday was a good day.  I took the GTI to Don's to have the other tranny seal replaced and to have his headlight switch installed.  Then I dropped by UPS and shipped a few items.  After that I picked up the rental car (2002 Malibu) and drove home.  Upon arriving home I was offered the data entry job.  Of course I said yes, so I have to have a drug test on Monday and I'll more than likely start on Wednesday (or as soon as they get my drug test results, which will be negative).  Payday is every two weeks, which I hate, but at least I'll be bringing home more than $110 a pay.  I'm still doing the Auto Connections thing, but it's on my own time and is commission only.  Today I ran around with Dr. Dork.  We hit two Wal-Marts and Fisher's Foods.  Exciting, I know.    Friday I went to return some CD's I purchased, and then realized I all ready owned.  I had asked the guy if I could return them when I purchased the items on Wednesday and he said it was fine.  OK, cool.  I go into Time Traveler and the owner guy starts being a dick about it.  I had my receipt, and the CD's were used to begin with.  I'd purchased the CD's two days before, so it wasn't like I'd had them forever and was suddenly trying to return them.  I told the owner what the other guy had said, and he starts getting all pissed and shit.  First he was going to let me return them, then he decided I had to find other stuff instead of getting a refund.  As I'm walking off I hear the owner say he's going to fire the other guy.  What a fucking ass.  Now mind you, this place has no visible return policy, and no policy on their receipts either.  The guy I purchased the CD's from has worked at Time Traveler for 4 or 5 years, so it's not like he was new and didn't know what he was doing, either.  The owner is just a dicksack, and I told him so after he decided I couldn't use my "return credit" toward any new CD's or any DVD's.  Fucking ass.  I hope that guy didn't get fired as I never would have said anything about it had I known that would happen.  Some people are such dicks.  Try posting a return/exchange policy and there won't be a problem.  The amusing thing was he first asked how I paid, like that made any difference.  I paid in cash, so he decided I couldn't have a refund.  Again, what a fucking dick.  So if you're from the Akron area, boycott Time Traveler for 6 months or so, and tell the owner it's because he's a dick.  The crappy neighbors are both in jail.  The guy is in jail for 58 days and the woman is in jail for 28 days.  He didn't appear for his probation hearing or sign up for parenting classes (endangering children and resisting arrest were his charges) and she didn't pay restitution or show up for community service (driving on a suspended license and failure to control) so they both were arrested on Tuesday.  They're also being evicted and their parents are currently next door moving their shit out.  Awesome!  I must point out once again that I do not live in the ghetto despite those crappy neighbors.  It was in the mid-70's on Friday, and in the 80's today.  My left arm is sunburned, woohoo!  I leave for the Queensryche concert in a little over 10 hours.  Woohoo!  On that note, I should go to bed or something.  That is all.

      I went on two interviews today.  One at a sign place in Belden Village (customer service/secretarial) and another at national magazine thing (data entry).  I hope I get one of the jobs as this 12 hours a week isn't worth shit.  The sign place is M-F 8:30AM-2:30PM and the data entry job is Monday and Wednesday noon-6, Thursday noon-8 and Friday noon-7.  Both pay $8/hr, and I think I'd like the sign job better as it's more variety; I wouldn't stare a computer screen the whole time.  I probably won't be offered either job, though, so that probably won't even be an issue.  I don't get paid until Monday which sucks donkey balls since I'm going to Columbus on Sunday.  Bah!  Tomorrow I have to take my car to Don's, drop some packages off at UPS, pick up the rental, return a pair of shorts to Goody's, return some CD's to CD Warehouse, go to Wal-Mart and take my Mom to the mall.  I'm supposed to work a visit to Minerva Dave in there as well; busy, busy.  All of this has to be finished by 2PM when I'm going to Cuyahoga Falls.  I bet you my paycheck I don't get out of bed until noon and shoot all of my plans to shit.  LOL  Today, other than those two interviews, I went into work for about 10 minutes and napped from 6-9:15PM.  I've also watched the Halloween DVD no less than 3 times.  Yes, I'm a dork.  Blogger is still down so I have no idea when this will actually appear on my blog.  I should probably go do something, or something.  LOL  That is all.

      Shit, I almost forgot...Yesterday when Dr. Dork and I went to play pool I was wearing my bunny ears.  We were going back to the pool tables (it's a bowling alley too) when we walked past this fat drunk guy.  Well him and his buddy started going "Shoot the bunny" and making guns with their hands.  OK, not a problem and moderately amusing.  Then the fat drunk guy's friend proceeded to say "I have an Easter dinner for you honey" upon which I almost barfed.  Nice, yes?  Dr. Dork didn't do anything as he's not a fat drunk redneck with an IQ of less than 30; only stupid people start fights over dumb shit like that.  On the way out, the same fat drunk buy was singing "Here Comes Peter Cottontail" as I walked by.  I must point out that I looked all of maybe 18 years old last night (I usually look 20 years old, tops).  I repeat, I almost barfed. Some people are fucking morons. Along the same bunny ears note, I realized I was walking through a foreign car junkyard while wearing bunny ears.  Seriously, someone should have taken a picture of that!!!!  That is all.

      Well all of my clothes are washed, as are all of my towels and washcloths.  I've taken to keeping at least a week's supply of both in my room as my Mom steals them and I'm left with nothing to shower with.  Speaking of the biddy, she rearranged the living room last night.  It looks much better this way, and I hope she leaves it like this for a while.  I finally cleaned out my closet and boxed up all of my winter jammies and sweatpants.  Now I just need to carry them, the the totes full of shoes, down to the basement.  Wish I had a clothes chute, that way I could toss the shoes down the chute instead of carrying the damn things down 4 flights of stairs.  Ick.  It helps to finalize a burned CD before trying to play it in your stereo.  Dumbass.  Have to return yet another pair of shorts to Goody's as they're too short.  I did find a nice pair of shorts at the Dillard's outlet yesterday and they were only $3.50!  Woohoo!  I also found a really cute shirt that has a turtle on the front.  I'll post a photo of the shirt tomorrow; it really is too cute.  That is all.

      Three words for you:  Strawberry Kool Whip  This weekend was busy but fun.  Friday I went to the Falls right after eating at Long John Silver's.  I was going to Hilarities with Jamie, but wound up getting horrifically sick from the LJS.  I was stuck in the Falls until 2-3AM when I was finally able to drive home.  Saturday found Dr. Dork and I going to Sam's Club for dinner (don't laugh, their pizza is hella good), the junkyard and to play pool.  We also went to the ghetto mall, Toys R Us and two K-Bee's toy stores.  I was supposed to go to his house today for Easter dinner, but when he called and woke me up at noon I felt fevered and basically like shit.  I think I was worn out from running around since Thursday and not getting enough sleep.    Check out my  urlLink Yahoo photo album   for the newly added What the Fuck folder.  I need to wash clothes.  That is all.

      I have your Friday Five:  1. What do you do for a living? Work 12 hours a week for a car sales thing, and I also do eBay stuff.  2. What do you like most about your job? It'll be fun once I start selling cars myself.  Oh, and I can wear jeans to work.  That always helps.  3. What do you like least about your job? I'm usually bored out of my skull due to lack of stuff to do.  4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because... I've stared at a computer for 6 hours straight without really doing anything.  5. What other career(s) are you interested in? Forensic Psychology, duh!  I'd also like to be a mechanic, so here's my thinking...I'll get my Forensic Psych Doctorate degree, then become a mechanic!  Sounds like a good plan to me.  All right, that Friday Five sucked balls.  Oh well, at least there was one this Friday!  I just got up about a half hour ago, so nothing's going on yet.  That is all.

      I must have these glasses:    Like they don't rock out!  bebe Tatiana frames.  The ones I want are a dark plum color, though.  The red's just a bit much for me.  Well now, Goody's is certainly a cool store.  I arrived around 9:15AM and all of the Goodie bags were all ready passed out.  I was about to knock someone down and take a bag, but I figured that wasn't very nice.  I found two shirts (a pink Double Bubble shirt and a blue shirt with some cabana thing on it) and two pairs of shorts.  I wound up returning the shorts because they're low rise and too damn short.  I found another pair of shorts on my second trip to Goodys' but they're too short too.  I guess I'm not supposed to wear shorts this summer as I can't find one pair I like.    Went to Dillard's for a return (another pair of shorts) and then ran to have my new prescription sunglasses made.  They rock out!  Stopped by Kempthorn Volkswagen to see if they have any R32 or 20th Anniversary GTI's.  Of course they didn't have either.  Fuckers.  I then roamed back to the service department and tried to get the GTI 16V badge for the back of my car.  The parts guy wound up calling someone in Germany only to find out the part isn't made anymore.  I ordered the turn signal/headlight switch thing so I will finally have low beam headlights.  Once I have that replaced I need to finally adjust my headlights so they point out instead of down.  I've not adjusted them yet because I have to ride around with my high beams on, and if my headlights were properly adjusted the lights would be too bright.  Since the headlights point at the ground, I'm OK.  I've not once had anyone flash me to turn down my high beams, so I guess they're not bright at all!  The VW guy also gave me a VW Driver Gear catalog chock full of VW stuff.  Woohoo!  Upon leaving the dealer, what did I find parked next to my GTI?  A green Corrado!  I drooled over it for a bit, then left the dealership.  I really love my car even though he's still leaking tranny oil.  I have to start going back into the office on Tuesday.  This is going to suck.  I get so bored just sitting there not doing anything, but I don't want to look like I'm not doing anything.  After about an hour of staring at the computer I start to get crabby, and I have to sit there for 6 hours!  At least I have a job, though, even if it is only 12 hours a week.  That is all.

      Grand opening of Goody's is in 6 hours.  I'm too excited.  Didn't do much today.  Ran around looking for shorts and couldn't find any I liked.  I did manage to pick up Jeepers Creepers for $9.44 at Wal-Mart and that's it.  I need to find a new brush since I forgot mine in Jenny's car.  I suck.  I took new photos of my car on Tuesday; they're posted in my Yahoo briefcase and on my webpage.  I took the photos by the McKinley Monument, but it's not like you can see anything in the photos anyway.  I washed the GTI again today, and vacuumed him out.  I've decided to give him a bath every week even if he's not dirty.  I need to wash the rims tomorrow after I get home from work; I have to go in and update my boss on my progress, and turn in my time sheet.  I'm wearing gloves when I clean the rims this time as that shit tore up my hands the last time I used it.  I'm going to  urlLink Hilarities   with  urlLink Jamie   and a bunch of his friends on Friday then I'm running around with Dr. Dork on Saturday.  I'll do some bodywork on the GTI this weekend if it's warm enough, and not raining.  There's a ton of freaking rust that's popped out on his rear hatch and it really looks like shit.  I hate sandpaper, though, and am not looking forward to the sanding part of the process.    All right, I'm off to re-code my webpage so my new photos show up.  That is all.

      The GTI is home again, but he seems to still be damned leaking.  I dunno what's going on, but at least no damage was done to the transmission.  Don also fixed my popping-out-of-5th-gear problem.  Don rocks.  I went down to the bar last night and had one screwdriver.  I rock.  I'm going today to get prescription sunglasses, that is if the glasses place is open today.  That is all.

      Guess who just got soundcheck passes for the Columbus Queensryche show?  Heehee, I rock.  Did a little shopping today in the Biddy Wagon.  My GTI is still at the shop; Don didn't even call me today which is very odd.  I hope he's OK and stuff.  If I haven't heard from him by noon or 1PM tomorrow I'm going to drive out and see if everything is OK.  I'm watching some weird remake of Carrie.  I should have known it was too good to be true; Carrie on DVD for $5?  Dammit.  Bleh.  That is all.

      The Clutch concert was fucking awesome!  They played for hours and hours; the first half was an instrumental set, then the regular set.  I was deeeeeeelighted, and would love to see them again.  It was easily one of the best concerts I've ever seen.  Queensryche is in two weeks; April 18th!!!  I'm now washing my coat and my clothes since they stink of cigarettes.  Ick.  I'm watching a 4 hour tape of MXC.  Woohoo!  That is all.

      I had a Quiznos Sub yesterday at the mall.  It was hella tasty and I would very much like another one.    Clutch is tonight at the Agora.  It'll be nice to get out of the house again.  The time change jacked me all up, but at least it'll be daylight much later into the evening.  Woohoo.  I should probably get a shower or something.    Things need to change or I'm going to be crabby the rest of my life.  Grrrrrrr.  That is all.

      I have such a juvenile sense of humor:  urlLink      Bleh.  I went to the mall today, and stumbled upon a hella good Hot Topic sale.  Picked up a cute Dickies purse for $10, and various stickers for my car at $1 each.  I can't wait to get my car back so I can decorate him even more.    I'm watching the Porsche Victory By Design special on Speedvision, then I'm either going to watch my Nip/Tuck DVD or some MXC that was taped on Thursday.  Hmmm, decisions, decisions.  That is all.

      Here's your drunken post for the evening; please forgive any spelling errors...  Went to Eldorado Lanes for bowling.  I knocked down 54 pins out of 200.  I fucking rock.  Went to the bar.  Drank 5 Smirnoff Ice, 1 jello shot, and one shot of Jagermeister.  The shot of Jager killed me.  I puked not 1 mile from the bar.  At least I didn't puke at the bar, that's so embarrassing.  I saw Party of course, since it's his bar, and Crypt was there too!  I guess he goes to Akron bars now, the Main Street Saloon and another bar that I can't remember the name of.  I'll have to check those out when I'm in the area.  He also said to check out Dirty Deeds, which is an AC/DC tribute band.  I will do that as well!   urlLink Jamie   met Jenny and I at the bar.  We played pool and he kicked both of our asses.  Oh well, at least he took it easy on us.  I think I'm going to bed now.  That is all.

      I guess Jenny isn't going to be here until 9 or 9:30.  That's good since it's 5 after 8 and I still have to take a shower.  I'm so lazy.  We're going bowling then going to the bar.  I've not been bowling since I was 5 or 6 years old; this should be interesting.  No car today and that sucks ass.  I'm off to get ready or something.  That is all.

      Woo!  Big Lots had the original Halloween on VHS for $3.99!  It's the digitally remastered THX version which I guess is even better.  I'd have liked to find it on DVD, but VHS for $3.99 is awesome!  Of course I'm watching it right now.  I made the Clinique girl cry today.  The biddy and I went to Elder Beerman so she could get a blusher and some hand lotion stuff.  Well we stood there for 10-15 minutes while the one Clinique girl helped another customer.  No problem; there was only one girl and a lot of customers.  Not her fault.  Well this bitch walks up as though she's going to get helped immediately.  We (the biddy and I) knew what we wanted, and the Clinique girl knew we were there first.  Well, I inquired about a lipstick and was told they were sold out.  I said that was OK, we still knew what we wanted and were ready to purchase the items.  The Clinique girl walks off and helps that bitchy woman who had been standing there about 2 minutes.  I then got pissed, put the stuff away and was walking off when she finished up with the other woman.  The Clinique girl was following me through the store begging me to come back and purchase the items.  I told her she should have thought of that prior to walking off when we were ready to make our purchases.  Finally she started crying, my Mom felt bad and she proceeded with the purchases.  I'm not an ass to salesclerks, but that girl deserved it.  When I worked at both JC Penney's and Montgomery Wards I provided excellent customer service and I don't think I'm out of line when expecting the same level of service in return.  Yeah, they're mostly younger kids who really don't want to be there to begin with.  Too bad, that's your job now do a good fucking job of it or you'll have to put up with pissed off customers.  So yeah, I made the Clinique girl cry at the Alliance, Ohio Elder Beerman.  Donald Pleasance is/was a fucking pimp.  I hope I get my car back tomorrow.  Gotta call Jenny in the morning and find out what time she's arriving tomorrow night.  Hopefully  urlLink Jamie   will still be able to meet us out there tomorrow night.  That'll rock.  Again, Jenny and I will be at Iron Tales Saloon in Canton; come buy us drinks!  Off to watch Halloween.  That is all.

      The GTI is on his way to the doctor.  He may not be fixed until Monday morning and that sincerely sucks ass.  AARP motoring plan is useless.  They only deal with one towing company, Canton Towing, and for the last two days their flatbed truck has been unavailable.  I called AAA instead, and if that dumb bitch sends a regular tow-truck out here, after I requested a flatbed, I'm going up to the AAA thing on Fulton Road and beating her ass.  I'm still sick, it's still raining and my head yuck is fucking with my sleep pattern.  Fucked up sleep pattern=grumpy Lisa.  Again, unnamed person you may fuck off and die.    Flatbed truck just came and snatched up the GTI.  He's getting an oil change too, for free, since I referred one of my brother Jeff's friends to Don.  Don is the pimp mechanic for VW and Honda, by the way.  Guess I should go change my Mom's air filter.  That is all.

      Well, I finally managed to change my blog's background music.  Everyone jump for joy.  I'm currently baking a cake.  For some reason I was in a baking mood, so I'm making a chocolate caramel cake with no icing.  Nice, yes?    I did absolutely nothing today.  I was quite tired from staying up until 9AM, so I slept from 9:15A-2P, then took a nap from 5P-7:45P.  I take that back, I did do out and drive around in Squeaky for a little bit, but nothing major.  Tomorrow evening it's goody bag stuffing time at the museum, Jamie and I are most likely getting together Friday evening after he gets off work and Saturday is  urlLink Super Summit 12  and the  urlLink Lincoln Highway cruise .  I went from not doing anything to having 18 million things planned in a 2 day time frame.  Oh well, it's better than sitting at home by myself.  I really need to straighten up my room.  That is all.

      As evidenced by the title of this entry, Jenny and I had quite the interesting time last (Friday) night.&nbsp; I got off work at 8:15PM and went directly to Mineral City to pick Jenny up at her house. She loaned her Mom the Firechicken for the evening, so Jenny couldn't drive up to my house. Anyway, I picked Jenny up and we were off to the bar. Arriving at the bar around 10:15PM, we found the actual bar area to be full. Jenny and I ordered up Smirnoff Ices and found a table. About 10 minutes later, two people left the bar so we took over their seats. I had noticed the two guys next to those seats staring at us while Jenny and I were at the table. When Jenny and I got up to sit at the bar, the fat guy (Moose) said to the skinny guy "They're coming over here". Nice. Anyway, Jenny and I sat down and these two smooth talkers attemtped to get Jenny and/or myself to show our boobs. Neither of us obliged, so the guys got pissed and left. Party then came over and teased me for chasing the guys off. He agreed that those two couldn't handle me, so it was best they left. Heehee! Anyway, another guy sat next to us, talked with us and bought us some drinks. Party and I chatted quite a bit, and overall Jenny and I had a good time. A lot more went on, I'm just too tired to type it out right now.  After we left the bar, Jenny and I ventured to Ferraro's Restaurant which is a well-known "after hours" food place. It's open 24 hours and caters to truckers. The food is excellent, but the service sucks ass. I wound up getting home around 5:15AM and was asleep by 5:45-6AM.&nbsp; I then woke up at 9:30AM in order to get my ass to the stylist in order to have my  urlLink hair colored  this morning at 10AM. After hitting Starbucks (Vanilla Bean Creme), Belden Village mall (exchanged the Bath and Body Works lotion that smelled like ass), Wal-Mart and Goody's, I'm wiped out.  I was supposed to go to Minerva Dave's BBQ this evening, but I'm just too tired and there was going to be waaaaay too many people there (over 40) that I wouldn't know. There's always another weekend.  I'm watching MXC then going to bed. I need sleep.  That is all.

      Goodness, these country singers sure suck ass.  Of all the live performances I saw, only 2-3 of the singers were actually decent.  The others, including Willie Nelson and Loretta Lynn, were talk-singing and the remainder were off-key and horrid.  Yet another reason I don't listen to country music.  Ack.  Blah, blah, blah.

      OK, I figured out that my blog isn't working unless you drop the "www" at the beginning of the address.  So, please update your bookmarks to read as follows: http://thelawnbunny.blogspot.com  Thank you.  Went to work today.  Nothing overly exciting occurred, but I did learn how to use the digital sender (think ultra-fancy fax machine) so I guess that's kind of exciting.  I am now responsible for digitally sending stuff so I guess that makes me useful or something.  Or not.  Hey, there's leftover pizza in the fridge.  Yum!  That is all.

      Why is it that all people feel they can start talking to me?  Do I look like I work at Target?  I was stading in line waiting to return a few items, the girl in front of me suddenly turned around and asked if that was where she applied for a job.  How the fuck would I know?  I told her I had no idea, and she resumed her line bouncing.  Seriously, this girl had to have been on something as she couldn't stand still.  Switching from foot to foot, looking around all paranoid, singing to herself (offkey too).  Crackhead.  My goal today is to find the  urlLink Wella  shampoo   I was babbling about last night.  I have the phone book ready and I'm going to call every beauty shop in the phone book until I find one that carries that shampoo.  I'm desperate, can you tell?  I need food.  That is all.

      Well now, today was quite the eventful day.  I saw three Frank Lloyd Wright homes today, all in Canton (Plain Township actually).  Visited Target where my Mom bought me Elmo jammies,and I picked up some astringent and shampoo.  Actually I thought I was buying shampoo and I wound up picking up the conditioner instead.  That's OK as I'd really like to find  urlLink Wella's Lifetex shampoo , but I've not been able to find any place around here that carries it.  I guess it's VO5's almond honey stuff until I find the Wella brand somewhere.  Anyway, we also went to the greenhouse so my Mom could buy some more flowers.  That was pretty much my day.  I think I'm going to bed now, instead of watching The House on Haunted Hill again.   That is all.

      I'm sweating.  I hate to sweat, especially when I'm sitting on the couch watching a DVD.  I really wish I had a brother who'd put the air conditioners in the windows.  We have three A/C units, one for my room, my Mom's room and the living room/downstairs, but I can't put them in the windows.  I can't pick the damn things up to move them 3 inches, let alone heft them into the windows.  This sucks ass.  Today I've done nothing.  I'm currently watching The House On Haunted Hill on DVD and washing clothes.  My Mom wants to go to Target later on this evening, but I'm not going anywhere until it cools off.  She refuses to use the AC in her car, and I'm not going shopping if I'm all sweaty and gross.  Nice, yes?  I'd still rather it were warm out than snowing and shit, but AC would be nice.  I guess Jenny and I are going to a Minerva Dave barbecue next Saturday, as long as it doesn't rain.  That should be fun.  Yesterday Dr. Dork and I went to the Barberton car show, Target, Dillard's Outlet in Rolling Acres Mall, Subway, Barnes and Noble and Wal-Mart.  All-in-all a very productive day.  I think I'll paint my toenails later this evening.  That is all.

      I was supposed to go out tonight with Jenny.  She was going to call me last night after 10PM and I didn't hear from her.  I tried calling for 2 hours this afternoon and the phone was busy.  Later on the phone just rang and rang.  Um, OK.  Needless to say I'm not the happiest camper right now.  I hope everything's OK at her house, and I wish she'd have called me to let me know we weren't going out tonight.  That is all.

      OK, so I'll be 25 in September (the 23rd, send presents). My knees feel as though they're 55 to 60 years old, minimum. I've had rheumatoid arthritis since I was very young (5 or so), and it seems to really be catching up with me right now. The pain's been so bad the last week or so, that I can't even sleep. This isn't fun, no sirree. I really need to get health insurance so I can resume my regular visits to an RA specialist Honestly, this sucks very large ass. My wrists have been bothering me a lot too; a lot more than they used to. Bah, to be 16 again!   Better news...I changed the Fucking Person&copy; I had hanging from my rear view mirror. I now have all of my college parking permits (yes, I'm a dork like that), a cherry air freshner, the floating ducky air freshner and the One Fish from Cat In The Hat air freshner hanging from my rear view mirror. I moved the monkey and bananas to my sunroof handle and the ice cream cone to my passenger side Oh Shit Handle&copy; . I took down the 2 Spongebob and 1 Grumpy bear freshners as they're hella old and need replaced. Anyone know of a good place to get cool air freshners for cheap?  urlLink Let me know!    OK, I'm watching Halloween Resurrection.&nbsp; I will succeed in doing nothing other than scaring myself silly, which will result in an inability to sleep. Nice.  I need to call Jenny tomorrow from work since I didn't hear from her tonight. I'll call her right before I leave just to make sure she and I are still going out tomorrow. I didn't make it over to the bar tonight, so I hope it's open tomorrow. On a side note, Rog told me Jenny and I should stop by the place he plays darts as well. It'll be a nice change of scenery prior to venturing off in the direction of Iron Tales Saloon.  OK, I've checked the closets, the basement and the kitchen cupboards; there's no boogeyman in the house so I can simmer down. I'm such a dork. The Halloween movies still scare the shit out me, even at my advanced age.  That is all.

      There's this guy where I work whom I can't stand.  He's a salesman which means I have to be nice to him, but he really irks me.  He comes in as late as possible then makes all of these requests to get his shit pushed to the front of the pile.  Excuse me, everyone else brings their shit in early, therefore they are before you.  I've not had one day where his paperwork is mistake free, and that wastes our time when we're trying to print stickers or type up ads.  Seriously, everything about him rubs me the wrong way.  I don't want to say anything and look like an ass, but is it too much to ask for the paperwork to be fully, and correctly, completed when he gives it to us for insertion, and for him to not dickfuck around until 5:30PM or 6PM, then turn in his shit?  It never fails, he always brings a ton of shit in for us to do late on Friday evening.  Holly fixed his ass tonight, though.  He was supposed to have some ads turned in by this afternoon by the latest and, of course, he didn't have the stuff turned in.  Well she went in and printed them out anyway so now all we have to do is cancel 20 or less of them instead of having to wait until tomorrow evening to renew them and change the ad copy.  When Holly told him this, he replied "Oh you did get them?".  Well yeah, because it's possible to do such a thing.  When he's bringing in new ads we can't pull up the stuff from another source; it has to come from him.  This may not seem like a big deal if you've never done this type of work before, but believe me it's a pain in the ass to have his work be all incorrect and shit, when you're trying to finish everything else.  Besides, all of the other salespeople are pretty good about making sure their stuff is correct, so what's his deal?  I know he's newish, but come on now.  He's been there long enough to realize if you wait until Friday at 6PM to turn in a 150 ads, us data entry people are going to be there until until 9 or 10 that night.  One Friday the sales manager made him stay until us data entry people got to leave.  I thought that was pretty cool of the sales manager to do that for us.  Anyway, I can't stand him and I'm having a hard time being cordial to him.  The sad thing is he seems like he'd be pretty nice on a personal level, but working with him is making me livid.  Seriously, just the sight of one of his fucked up insertions makes me want to throw a wire basket at his head.  Just thought you'd like to know.  Other than that, work was fine today.  That is all.

      Whee, I kind of rearranged my room.  What I did is cleaned out one of my closets, then drug my dresser into the closet.  Seriously, that made a huge difference in regard to space in my room.  It's weird how moving one thing can make such a difference in a room, even a big room like I have (not bragging, just stating a fact).  I'm going to run around like a crazy person Friday before work.  I have to ship two packages of shoes, buy two money orders to send partial refunds with those packages, call Summit and see if my coil springs/struts are in, get gas and copy my paycheck stub to send into the student loan administrator people.  All of that has to be finished by 11:30AM and I hate getting up before 9AM.  I think I'm going to have to get up earlier than 9AM, though, and that'll suck.  Oh well, at least everything will be taken care of and I can enjoy my weekend.  Must clean the shoes I plan on wearing to work tomorrow.  Why do people walk around with missing teeth?  Seriously, buy some fucking teeth.  That is all.

      Anyway, I just went out to the bank and came home to try and fix my Spastic Clicker&copy;.  The inner rear driver side clicker, and the front side driver side clicker are both not working.  When a clicker bulb isn't working, it causes the rest of the clicker locations on that side of the car to become Spastic Clicker&copy;.  I don't know what's going on and it's pissing me off!  At least I have low beam and high beam headlights, though.  That is all.

      People are dumb.  Someone from IL called me about 25 minutes ago, and didn't leave a message.  If I don't recognize the number, I don't answer the phone.  You'll never get me to answer the phone by calling from a number I don't recognize, so leave a damned message!  People do that shit to me all the time, even on my cell phone.  Leave a message!

        AOL Email                     I wanted to kill my landlord this morning.&nbsp; 8AM I hear this fucking banging from next door.&nbsp; Turns out the landlord is over there banging on shit, and he hasn't stopped.&nbsp; I didn't have to get up until 10AM, but I was up at 8AM.&nbsp; I am crabby.      &nbsp;    Just thought everyone would like to know.      &nbsp;    That is all.

      I'm watching MXC on SpikeTV.  I love MXC.  Tabulah Babaganoosh.  That's all I have to say.  Need more  urlLink iced tea  .  Holy smokes, that shit is expensive on the website.  I buy mine at Value City for $2.99 a tin!  It's pretty tasty even though it is diet tea.  I think I'll go to bed.  That is all.

      This is one of the cutest things I've ever seen:     Best part?  Only $7 at Gabe's!  My Mommy bought it for me since I had a total shit-fit when I saw this purse, but am too much of a tightwad to spend $7 on it.  Seriously, isn't it hella cute?  Lets see, the biddy drug me to the greenhouse to buy dirt, then we came back home so I could change shirts (got caught in the rain) and we then proceeded to go to the pet store, World Market and Value City.  Upon exiting Value City we went to Denny's where I ate too much and had to roll myself into the car.  From Denny's we ventured to Gabe's then came home.  That was my day.  I am now sitting on the couch.  That is all.

      OK, that title is so dorky.  Oh well.  Another neighbor has moved out.  The guy two doors down had to move due to high daycare costs ($188 week!) for his little girl.  He's moving closer to his parents so they can watch the little girl when he's at work.  That has to suck.  I liked Dennis, too.  He was nice, quiet and his little girl was so well behaved.  Albeit she's only about a year old, but still.  No icky neighbors, please!  I have to run my Mom to the garden place so she can buy dirt.  I'm also going to transplant my sunflower as it's big enough to move out of the smaller pot.  All of our cool tulips died before I had a chance to take a photo of them.  We had black/purple tulips (I picked those out) and pink tulips with yellow edges.  They rocked!  Hopefully my bleeding heart will bloom a couple more times this summer because right now there's no flowers to be seen.  Need to eat.  That is all.

      I've been productive so far this morning.  I washed 2 more loads of clothes, hung up the clothes that are clean, carried two boxes of winter jammies to the basement and arranged the shoes that are lucky enough to live in my room.  Now it's time for a nap since the banging from the siding guys seems to have simmered down.  That is all.

      Quarter til 8 this morning the neighbor is outside my fucking window yelling at her kid.  10 after 8 this morning the siding guys decide to start slamming around on the house 2 doors down.  What the fuck?  Needless to say, I'm not too chippy this morning.  Fucking shit...  People need to learn how to park, as well.  That is all.

        AOL Email                     OK, I think my subject line pretty much says everything, but allow me to elaborate.&nbsp; A girl at work, Holly, and I both do not want to have kids.&nbsp; Holly was just married on Saturday, so she and I were joking about how people are going to start with the "when are the kids arriving" jokes.&nbsp; Everyone knows she doesn't want children, yet they keep telling her she'll change her mind.&nbsp; Excuse me, but why do people feel this is an appropriate thing to say?&nbsp; Some people want kids, some don't.&nbsp; Holly and I fall into the "don't want kids" category.&nbsp; Personally speaking, I'm too intolerant to have kids, and I believe Holly feels that was as well.&nbsp; I don't like kids for the most part.&nbsp; My idea of fun isn't changing diapers and going to PTA meetings.&nbsp; I do not need children in order to feel "whole".&nbsp; I understand some people dream of having children.&nbsp; My friend Jenny is a good example.&nbsp; She's wanted kids very badly as long as I've known her (12 years).&nbsp; Finally 6 years ago she had her first son after undergoing some fertility treatments.&nbsp; Her second son was born&nbsp;2 years ago and her daughter a year ago.&nbsp; Jenny loves her kids more than anything, and I think they're pretty neat as far as kids go.&nbsp; Just because I like her kids doesn't mean I want any of my own.&nbsp; There's no way I could put up with a half-day of the stuff she has to do for her kids, let alone at least 18 years worth of stuff.&nbsp; That said, would you really want me to procreate?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; Another thing that makes me laugh is people who tell me I'll want kids when I get older.&nbsp; OK, I'll be 25 in September.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I'm old enough to realize if I want kids or not.&nbsp; I choose or not, thank you.&nbsp; My personal favorite is when people ask if I want kids and I tell them I do not.&nbsp; When said person keeps pressing me about kids I finally get fed up and tell them I can't have kids.&nbsp; The person then says "Well, that's your business" and gets all red faced or whatever.&nbsp; Excuse me, but isn't it also "my business" if I want kids or not?&nbsp; The person feels like an ass because they kept pushing the kid issue, then they found out I can't have kids and they are then embarrassed.&nbsp; And they should&nbsp;be embarrassed as it's none of their business if I want kids or not.&nbsp; That's what they get for all of the pushing they do to change my mind in regard to kids; let them feel as stupid as they are.&nbsp; Grrr, as you can probably tell, this irritates me to no end.      &nbsp;    That is all.

      Well now, wasn't I Miss Productivity today?  I washed my clothes, cleaned my room, cleaned out my car, checked the oil and the antifreeze, cleaned all of the car windows, Swiffered the dash and doors and made iced tea.  Damn, I rock.  Dr. Dork's Mom washed his wallet tonight.  I think that's one of the funniest things she's ever managed to do.  Usually she just bleaches his clothes, so this washing of the wallet is excellent.  I told him if he'd wash his own clothes these things wouldn't happen.  Besides, he's carried that wallet for 11 or 12 years and it was pretty damn tattered.  Heehee!  Tomorrow is the first car show of the season.  Originally Saturday would have been the first show at Kempthorn Auto Mall, but it rained yesterday so I didn't attend that show.  The first car show is in  urlLink Cuyahoga Falls at Front Street  .  They've renovated all of Front Street so I'm sure it'll be really nice.  They have Rockin on the River every Friday evening as well, but I think it'll be impossible for me to attend anymore since I work late on Friday evenings.  That's OK, as Rockin on the River is nicknamed Drunkin on the River for a good reason; mostly it's old drunk people staggering around and being stupid.  No good bands announced so far, therefore I'm not missing much.  I'm off to watch Helter Skelter.  That is all.

      Heehee, some strange things were afoot at Akron U's Chemical Engineering lab.  Dr. Dork show me  urlLink this video   last night.  It's the true story of three Chem E undergrads who graduated in May.  Yeah, way too much spare time for these Chem E's.  It's an amusing video, even if you don't know the background info.  Just so you know, the girl posed like that without knowing the photos were going to be used for a video; she poses like that for no reason.  The cartooning of the photos was obtained free at some site that I don't remember the name of right now.  They're real photos.  Again, way too much time on their hands.  I haven't really done anything today.  I'm planning on doing laundry and watching a DVD or two.  Exciting, I know.  That is all.

      Blogger's been herky jerky for the last week or so.  Everytime I try logging into Bstats, I am taken to May 9th's stats instead of the current stats.  What the fuck?  Also, my profile views counter is stuck on 16.  Again, what the fuck?  Oh well, at least I can still post and everything else seems to be in order as far as Blogger goes.  My webpage host is down for updates today.  The pages are still showing up, but I can't update anything until later this evening.  Dr. Dork and I are allegedly going to Perkins in Hudson for dinner.  In freaking Hudson!!!    I woke up at noon to the tune of the new neighbor's crappy rap music.  It was pretty fucking loud, so I went next door and kindly (yes, kindly for the first request) asked him to turn it down.  He did so, but he also turned it back up within 45 minutes.  Why can't we have normal neighbors who don't play their music too loud, don't have criminal records and don't have any kids?  Is that too much to ask?  As an interesting aside, everytime I've seen that kid he's had his cell phone glued to his ear.  I am not exaggerating when I say this.   Everytime I've seen him , the phone was stuck to his ear.  Maybe he was in a horrific accident where the phone malfunctioned and was permanently bonded to his head?  Or maybe he's just some young punk kid who doesn't know any better?  I think I'll go with young punk kid.  Hmmm, I think that's it.  That is all.

Sheesh, you'd think Holly would come in during the morning, I mean she's just getting married.  LOL  (A joke, people.  Lighten up.)

      Dr. Dork emaild me with some amusing news.  On his way to school this morning he saw some poor girl driving my old BaronBomb!  It had the Willy's exhaust, the rippled driver side rear fender and the passenger side phantom dent.  The poor, poor girl.  Had I been with him, I would have signaled the girl to pull over so I could have warned her about the BaronBomb.  The poor fool!  I'm still tweaking my Blogger format, so things may be silly for the next couple days.  I'll try to not delete the whole fucking format again.  Travis is coming to Wooster sometime this summer, woohoo!  Must get a shower as the biddy wants to go to Target and/or Wal-Mart.  That is all.

      I really hate the expression "good to go".  Where am I going?  Why is it suddenly good?  Whomever starting this saying needs smacked.  I've fixed my titles so they should be showing up in red at the top of every post.  I also changed the background music.  Fiddling with my blog settings for an hour actually ended with good results!  That is all.

      The new Blogger layout is really nifty!  I see my titles still aren't showing up, but that's OK.  I can now post to my blog simply by sending an email to a special blogger address.  Isn't that nifty?  The biddy and I went to Jeff's house this afternoon.  We sat around, ate pizza and generally bullshat.    New photo added to the Sunflower Project page.  That is all.

      Washed my car today.  Went to Don's this morning and found out I need a new valve cover gasket; that's why I'm losing oil.  It'll be around $150, so I have to wait until the 24th.  I get paid on the 20th or so, but I have to wait until the Monday after so Don can have time to fix it.  I guess I have oil on the flywheel, and the clutch, so I'm going to probably need another new clutch.  Hopefully I don't, but I probably will.  My tranny is still leaking, but it's coming from the throwout bearing access thingie, so it's no big deal to fix.  My car is still awesome though.  I named him by the way...Squeaky Bobaganoosh.  Went to the bar and had one beer.  I had a Bud as the guy couldn't find the Smirnoff Ice.  Party was outside so I only saw him briefly.    I think I'm going to bed or something.  That is all.

      Again this weekend, I didn't go out like I'd hoped.  Oh well, maybe I'll be able to save up some cash instead of blowing it on liquor.    I worked until almost 10PM (9:45 to be exact).  That was insane; almost a 12 hour workday which consisted of staring at a computer screen.  Not fun.  Have to be at Don's by 9AM tomorrow morning; won't that be fun.  Getting up at 7:30 on Saturday morning.  Bah!  Fuck it, I'm going to bed.  That is all.

      Why did I go to bed at 9:30PM?  Probably because I was tired from not having fallen asleep until 5:30 yesterday morning (a whopping three hours of sleep for you mathematically challenged folks).  I know when I go to bed early I wake up no later than 2AM, then can't go back to sleep.  Well, I woke up at midnight and can't go back to sleep.  This isn't making for happy times, nor am I feeling particularly zen-like.  Bah.  I really wish Friday night would hurry up and get here all ready.  I do get my first paycheck tomorrow, though, so that's something to look forward to.  I can't cash it until Friday, but then where could I cash a check after 6 -7PM on a Thursday evening anyway?  Must run virus scan on my PC.  I hate viruses, and the stupid people who create them.  I would up having nothing for dinner.  Bad move as the chili I had for lunch came back for a visit around the time I woke up.  Not fun.  This weekend I will wash my car (as long as it doesn't rain), go to Don's on Saturday morning to have him check the GTI's oil leak and go to the Goody's sale with my Mom.  Mind you I won't buy anything, but I love shopping that much.  Dr. Dork is coming down here on Saturday, and he made mention of bringing 4 new Sopranos episodes with him.  Woohoo!  Holy crap, I think I feel sleep creeping up on me!  That is all.

      I really wished to have been poked in the eye today.  It's not that anything bad happened, it was just a long day.  Plus, every person who came into the office insisted upon crowing "It's such a beautiful day today".  Like we wanted to fucking hear that.  Shut.Up.  I did run into Mike after work, so that was cool.  Pizza or Taco Bell for dinner?  Hmmm....  That is all.

      The other gmail invitation has been claimed.  Sorry if you slacked and wanted the other invitation, but it now sucks to be you.  Went to Goody's and Cato's where my Mom bought me a shirt and a pair of pants.  I don't know which one I'm wearing to work tomorrow, but probably the shirt.  They're in the wash now, so they will be clean in the morning.  I have to go in to work at 10AM which means I must get up at 8:30AM.  I'm going to be crabby the rest of the week due to my early start time.  Grrrr.  My Mom bought some flowers for the front of the house.  A bleeding heart plant and some other flowers that are cool looking, and I'm not sure what they are.  They're purple, white and yellow and they're small.  I would get a photo but I'm too comfy to get up and take a picture, so that wonderful description will have to suffice for now.  Off to get my clothes out of the washer.  That is all.

      GTI goes to the doctor tomorrow for his oil leak/oil useage deal.  Don said I can stay while he examines the GTI, just in case we have to order parts or something.  My car just started leaking after the oil was changed, I wonder what's going on?  He still runs great, doesn't smoke and all seems well.  Just a small puddle underneath him, and I have to keep adding oil.  Never a good thing.  Grrrrrr.  Oh well, still a billion times better than the BaronBomb.  Today was moderately productive.  I flipped my mattress, changed my sheets, dusted my floor (it's wood) and I'm now doing laundry.  If I'm feeling especially spunky I'll clean my GTI's windshield.  I probably won't get to that today, though, since it's now 8:30PM and pretty close to dark.  Oh well, there's always tomorrow.    Heather (my boss) called today.  She wanted me to work tomorrow, but unfortunately I can't.  I have to take my car to Don's, pay my cell bill, pick up my prescription and call Sprint PCS.  The mechanic deal will take at least 2-3 hours, so that's pretty much going to shoot my whole day.  Oh well, it needs to be done.  I am, however, starting at 10AM this week instead of noon.  I wish I could have worked tomorrow, as that, coupled with beginning at 10AM, would have enabled me to buy the new coil springs my car so desperately needs.  I will be able to buy the front set, though, so that's better than nothing.  Woohoo, I'll be halfway to a non-bumpy GTI!  Hmmm, I think I'll hit Burger King for a Junior Whopper minus lettuce and a chili.  Never had Burger King's chili?  You're missing out.  That is all.

      OK, I'm finished bitching about Blogger.  It's a good system, and I guess I shouldn't complain too much since it's free.  I was paying $5 a month for upgraded service, but I've not been charged in over a year.  Like I just said, I won't complain anymore, or at least anymore today.  Must call Sprint PCS and find out if I can get my old phone reactivated without paying 7 million dollars.  I miss my old phone, plus Alltell's service sucks ass.  That is all.

      I just noticed my titles aren't showing up when I use my Mozilla browser.  Anyone have any guesses as to what's wrong?  I didn't see Pulp Fiction last night; I was too tired after going to Beachwood Place, Borders, Summit Mall and 2 Targets.  Oh well, that's OK.  It would have been cool, but I can live without having seen Pulp Fiction in a theater.  Halloween, though, is a different story all together.  LOL  I found these shoes at Nordstrom yesterday.  They had pink, white and black.  I'm leaning more toward the pink than the black; white isn't even an option:       I saw my first Nissan 350Z convertible on Thursday evening.  The top was up, but the car was still quite nifty looking.  I also saw a couple Chrysler 300C's on the road; not too bad for an American car.    That is all.

      The GTI's stereo is messed up.  My subs have stopped working correctly.  Sometimes they won't work at all, and when they do decide to work the bass is all fucked up and weird sounding.  My new neighbor was outside yesterday before I went to Strongsville, and he offered to help me figure out what's doing with my stereo.  I thought that was quite nice of him, but I had to refuse his offer last night since I was running late (as usual).    Well, my GTI's brake line will not be fixed this week as I will not have enough money to fix it out of this pay.  Ass sucking shit, that's all it is.  I'm going to take a nap, then it's off to UPS I go.    That is all.

      Forgot to mention this little tidbit...I was driving to Burger King on Monday, just putting along minding my own business.  Some dumb Honda driving cunt was coming out of the McDonald's lot, via the wrong lane, and almost smacked right into me.  She totally pulled out without even looking.  Seriously, if you can't see my car you're blind as fuck.  OK, so maybe you are.  Hello, you can hear my car too.  I slammed on my brakes, squealed to a stop and yelled quite a few not nice things in her general direction.  Dumb twat.  I took some photos of VW's last night at  urlLink DWVW .  They're in my  urlLink Yahoo photo album , in the conveniently named "VW Photos" folder.  Check em out.  Yeah, I spend my Saturday evening at the VW dealer taking pictures.  Fucking loser.  As most of you have noticed, I'm not in the mood to blog.  I'm really not in the mood to do anything other than strangle that cocksucker with my bare hands, but since I can't do that I've spent a lot of time planning my revenge.  It shall be sweet, and swift.  Grrrrrrrr.  That is all.

      I am home, and have been home since a quarter after midnight.  What the hell is going on?  I have no idea, but I find out tomorrow.  Needless to say he and I didn't hit any bars after he closed up for the night.  I guess he and Crip were going out, which is fine, but there's no reason to be an ass about it.  Especially after being so sweet Saturday night.  What the fuck?  I'm babbling.  I would excuse myself but I pay for this motherfucker, so I don't need to apologize.  When you're paying for my blog I'll apologize.  Until then, fuck off if you don't like what you're reading.  I really have nothing to say, so I'm going to bed.

      It would be nice if my high speed CD burner actually burned CD's at high speed instead of taking 8 days to burn one CD.  Sometimes it will burn a complete CD in less than 2 minutes, and other times it takes 10 minutes to burn a CD.  Grrrrrrr.  I'm taking the GTI to Don to have the tranny fluid checked/refilled.  Don said I may have a bearing going bad and it was just catching when I heard the noise.  He doesn't have time to check the tranny today, but at least I'll know if the fluid level is down.  If the fluid level is OK then I'll know the tranny is going bad.  Not good, not good at all.  Conveniently the bar is right over by Don's place, so if my car decides to die anytime soon I'll probably be close to the mechanic.  LOL  I'm not sure if I should have admitted that or not.    Ah, now my CD burner starts burning at high speed.  What the hell?  Is this a variable rate thing, or what?  Along those same lines, how hard is it for people to make sure their songs are properly named?  Honestly now, most CD programs (Windows Media Player, Real Player) have a feature that automatically detects the artist, title and track listing of whatever CD you are listening to.  How hard is it to check the information, and make any corrections?  People are so fucking lazy, I swear.  Speaking of lazy, I think I'll lay down until around 1PM then go have my car checked out.  I didn't go to bed until 4 this morning, and Don called at 9AM so I'm a touch sleepy.  That is all.

      Not only do I feel like a smacked ass, but my GTI's tranny is making that whirring sound again.  Apparently it's low on fluid, again, so I have to run it to Don's tomorrow morning.  Hopefully Don'll be able to work me in as I have plans tomorrow evening that won't come to fruition if I don't have wheels.  It was weird, though, because I noticed the sound when I was in 3rd gear, then about 2 miles later it stopped making the noise.  Oh well, I'm still having it checked, and hopefully Don has the part to fix it as well (the throw-out bearing access plate is where the leak is coming from this time).  So I must be up at the asscrack of dawn tomorrow in order to get my car fixed, and that's only if Don can work me in.  Grrrr.  It looks like someone snagged on the driver side window of my car.  I know  I  wasn't puking last night, and no one else should have been near my car, so what the fuck is going on?  Way too much Smirnoff Ice last night.  I guess I shouldn't complain since I wasn't buying them.  I'm not hungover, but my ass is certainly dragging.  I know, most of you would consider that a hangover but I don't have a headache and my stomach isn't upset.  I'm just ass-dragging tired.  That is all.

      Today sucked ass.  Let me rephrase, it didn't suck ass per se, but it was quite eventful.  First off, everything I touched today at work wound up breaking.  I managed to break the IAQ computer, the digital sender and the digital sender computer.  Thankfully the office manager fixed everything for me, but I felt so bad for her!  I still wound up getting out of work at 8:15PM, so that's not too bad I guess.  I drove around Canton this evening looking for someone to race, but found no one.  Dammit.  I then went to Taco Bell.  I rock.  Saturday is the Massillon car show, then Sunday is the Stan Hywet show.  Woohoo!  That is all.

      I am living in the middle of a Jerry Springer episode.  I was out at the bar tonight, and he asked it I'd like to go to another bar with him; I said cool.  I followed behind him in the GTI mobile, and he was on the bike.  Thankfully I wasn't on the bike as it started to rain like a motherfucker right after we arrived at the bar (which he said it would, and was why I wasn't on the bike).  Anyway, I digress...We get to the bar, he and I are chatting and whatever when I have to pee.  I go to the bathroom, and as I'm coming out I swear I hear his bike start up.  Turns out the chick he owned the bar with had come in, and he left real fast.  That's OK, though, as I understand why.  The bartender lady came up to me and told me what was going on, so I'm not pissed.  I'm amused to be honest; who'd have thought boring old me would be wrapped up in some Jerry Springer shit like this?  Besides, he and that chick aren't together, but she wanted to cause problems.  She saw my car there, with his bike, and she stopped.  Heehee, I must giggle.  No, I'm not drunk.  I'm not even impaired.  I can imagine how amused I'd be if I were drunk, though, and I'd probably have mouthed off to boot.  Guess it's a good thing I don't get drunk on work nights, isn't it?  I rock.  In other rants, if I'm supposed to call you, be off the damn phone!  You know who you are, dork.  I am off to bed.  Notice I go to bed earlier than I was prior to going to the bar.  I'm the only person I know who goes to a bar and has one drink all damned night.  Again, I rock.  That is all.

      Yeah, I get myself into some shit.  That's all I'm saying for now.  I must go out and check the oil in the GTI as he was making an insane racket on the way home.  Not good.  I hit a huge fucking pothole on the way home from work and my fucking rear view mirror fell the fuck off.  Bastards.  I said "fuck" a lot in the previous sentence.  Holly needs to dump more often or else the system will be clogged.  Heehee!  That is all.

      Ain't nothing going on.  Wow, how was that for a butchering of the English language?  Anyway, I woke up relatively early for me; 2:30PM.  I was up at 20 of noon when John called and woke me up, but I went back to sleep after we got off the phone.  I think I'm going out tonight, but I'll only have one or two drinks, two at the most.  I need to cut back on my alcohol consumption, plus I'll be driving home so I definitely don't need to drink too much.  All right, I'm going to finish watching Joy Ride on DVD then get a shower or something.  That is all.

      OK, so I'm not in bed.  But MXC is on!  Woohoo!  I'm watching that, then 2 episodes of Knight Rider and I'll hopefully be ready for bed.  Plus, I'm finishing my laundry.  That is all.

      Nothing's going on.  I slept until 6PM this evening, drove around Canton for about an hour then came home.  I'm now watching Wild Boyz and plan on being asleep by midnight.    Yesterday I was in Akron for about 8 hours.  Went to eat at Parasson's in Akron, drove around and fucked off.  All in all quite the boring weekend.  It was quite the break from the insanely busy week I had last week.  That is all.

      Nothing blog worthy went on today.  I didn't go to work as I was up half the night yakking my guts out, along with nastiness from the other end too.  Was that an overshare?  Anyway, I called Heather, my boss, and told her what was doing.  She was really cool about it, which I really appreciate.  The only thing I can figure is the Chinese food (boneless spare ribs, shrimp egg roll and shrimp fried rice) I had last evening was nasty or something.  My tummy is still a little queasy, but I'm much better than I was this morning, and I'm sure I'll be fine tomorrow.  It's storming and I'm hoping the power doesn't go out.  I have 3 invitations for Google Gmail accounts.   urlLink Email me  if you are interested in claiming one of the invitations.  That is all.

      I'm having an insanely good time with Party, but I need to cut out the late nights.  I'm not 18 anymore, and staying out late is kicking my ass.

      Like I said in the previous post I edited, I feel like a schmuck.  Party wound up calling me at 1AM to say he wasn't getting out of the bar early.  I told him that was OK and I greatly appreciated him calling me anyway.  Well I wound up going out to the bar as he thought we would be able to get some late night riding in, but I was late getting there.  Why, you ask?  I got pulled over, bastard.  The town I live in has shitty fucking roads, so I have to weave everywhere to avoid fucking up my suspension even more than it all ready is.  Anyway, the cop pulled me over, asked if I'd been drinking and I told him no (which I hadn't been).  He then asked why I was weaving and I told him it was because the roads fucking suck ass and if I break something in my suspension I highly doubt the city will pay to have it replaced.  I smarted off and he let me go!  Woohoo, I rock!  Just thought everyone would like to know.  If not, too bad, you know anyway.  That is all.

      OK, I told my Mom someone may be calling for me tonight, so if the phone rings and it's an unknown or private number to please answer the phone.  What's she do?  Gets on the phone and calls my brother Jeff, at TEN IN THE EVENING.  She never calls Jeff this late during the week because he is a truck driver and more than likely trying to sleep.  This is seriously pissing me off.  She does this shit all the damn time.  Now I wish I'd have kept my own phone line, but it was silly to pay $55/month for something I could have on the downstairs phone for $20/month.  Grrrrr, I really, really wish I hadn't had my phone disconnected.  On the off chance he does actually call me, I'd like to answer the phone and A.) not have to deal with her grilling him before she gives me the phone and B.) not have to wonder if he did call and she just didn't click over (she's really good at that shit).  Besides, I'd really like to go out riding as it's been years since I've been.  I'm off to steam.  That is all.

      Edited (June 8, 2004 @ 4:30AM) because I feel like a schmuck.  The beginning of the entry is gone, and will not be resurrected.  Now on to the remainder of the original post:  In other news, I just received this wonderful reply from AudBlog's customer non-service department:    Hi, --------- Noah Glass LISTENLAB INC                   Think it....Speak it!     Yea, your post is lost forever. Sorry.   I looked for it but couldnt find anything.   Noah    What the hell kind of reply is that?  I asked him what I needed to do to ensure the posts went through from now on, and he totally didn't address that concern.  Nice, yes?  But then, I do have over 65 thousand posts remaining, so I shouldn't complain too much.  OK, I'm off to finish up my laundry and maybe get to bed early.  That is all.

      OK, like I said earlier, I tried to do an audio post Saturday night around 3:45AM.  For whatever reason the post didn't work out.  Upon checking my audblog account I found this to be quite strange:   audblog Account Info Account Status: Active	 You have 65535 Post(s) remaining Click the PayPal button to purchase a block of posts.   I have over 65 THOUSAND posts remaining?  What the hell is going on?  I'm not complaining, but that leads me to believe my whole audblog account is messed up.  Grrrr.  Nothing else is going on.

      Holy crap,  urlLink Ronald Regan died.  I'm all teary eyed and shit as he was the fucking pimp, and an excellent speaker. The president during my favorite decade would, of course, be my favorite president. I can't believe he died, even though he was quite advanced in age and had been sick for quite a few years.

It rocks my socks as it has a glowy logo thingie.  I would take a photo but my camera is outside and I'm too drunk to brave the stairs.  I rock.  Rammstein is on.  Jamie still has no comment.

      I just had to share.  I picked up a piping hot on the way home from work.  My total was $7.95, so I gave the lady $10.05 thinking I'd get $2 back.  Here's my reasoning; I gave the lady a nickel, so that would have made it $8, meaning I'd get $2 back.  I'm a fucking moron.  The worst part is Dr. Dork tried explaining it to me, and I just don't understand.  That is all.

      Edited June 3, 2004-11:30AM So irrelevant to daily life, I don't know what I was even crabby about.  Oh what a difference a night's sleep makes.   I'm confused, which means I'm in a crabby mood.  I hate being confused, and I certainly hate being confused about something this important.  My tendency to be quite gullible has struck again, and this time it's a whopper.  Oh well, maybe I'm completely wrong.  In this instance I'd love to be proven wrong.   Tomorrow is Thursday.   I need Friday to get here quickly as I need a mini vacation from life.   I know, most of you are probably wondering why  I need a mini vacation  when I don't really do anything, but there are things I keep to myself and don't write in my journal.  I keep things to myself?  Surely you jest!!  I can see this post is going nowhere fast, so I think I'm finished.  That is all.

      Well now, I am certainly glad today's work time is over.  The first 3.5 hours were spent trying to not fall asleep, then the last 2.5 hours were busy.  I don't know what it was today, but everyone seemed worn out.  Tomorrow is Thursday, woohoo!  That means the day after tomorrow is FRIDAY!!!  Which reminds me, I need to email Jamie and get directions to his place of employment so that I may meet him there Friday.  Jamie gets off work at 12:30, so I'm meeting him after work instead of having him drive all the way to my house, then all the way back to Party's.  K, since no one really cares, I'm finished with that.  Actually, I'm totally finished.  That is all.

      Well I guess  urlLink Morgan  sleeping all fucking day did have its' benefits.  Instead of driving up there around 4 or 5 like I'd planned, I fixed my headlights and grille then cleaned out my car.  The GTI shouldn't smell like gear oil anymore, and believe me, that's a good thing.  I also finished my laundry so I now have clean clothes.  When I'm digging in the back of my closet for clean clothes, it's time to do laundry, and I've been digging in the back of the closet for at least 2 weeks.    Some people need to get the fuck off the couch and answer the damn phone.  That is all.

I hate driving in the rain.   urlLink Ribs Burn-Off  is next weekend, woohoo!  I didn't go last year, so this'll be the first year I experience the fairgrounds  burn-off instead of the traditional downtown Canton burn-off.  Oh well, at least all of the stupid out-of-towners will be contained to the area by the fairgrounds; this is good.  That is all.

      Friday consisted of driving the Taurus along the Ohio/Erie Canal scenic byway, checking out a cool old fort, getting lost again by following the signs (on the road this time) and generally fucking around.  Saturday consisted of going to Sandusky around midnight so Morgan could show me Cedar Point at night (I've never been to Cedar Point) and more general fucking around/watching TV.  Today consisted of sleeping and him driving me to Target.  I then went out with Rog and I'm now leaving again as people suck.  LOL  That is all.

         Yeah, I totally wanted to kill yesterday.  Morgan decided we should go to Brandywine Falls.  Cool, fine, peachy.  I've never been there, and it sounded like fun, so I'm all for it.  After we looked at the falls, he decided we should go on one of the hiking trails for a bit.  Again, that's fine.  FOUR HOURS LATER we finally find my car.  Never, ever trust the signs in the Metroparks unless you want to wind up fucking lost and wandering for 3.5 hours.  Then, by all means, follow the signs.  If I hear him utter "There's a sign" ever again, he's dead.  I don't care how fucking cute he is, he's dead.  As an amusing aside, we were lapped by a jogger who would have been clotheslined had he happened by us again.  Mind you this all happened from 5:30AM-9:30AM after I'd been up all night.  I went to sleep around noon yesterday, after the lost-in-the-Metroparks adventure, got up around 6:30PM last night, talked to Jenny, went back to bed around 8PM and just woke up about a half hour ago.    Some   of us have to work today, and I have no idea what the rest of us are going to do while I'm at work.  Guess that would have been a good thing to have figured out prior to, well, now.      "Kirk here."  "She's unavailable, Captain."  "Kirk out."  This is what happens when you call me 20-30 times within 7 hours, Morgan is answering my phone and we're watching Star Trek while you're calling.  Please, don't be stupid.      Must get ready for work.      That is all.

      Yeah, had a busy fucking end of the week/weekend. Here's a photo from when he and I went to Pitt and found an exotic car dealership. I just had to take a photo of him with the Lambo, because he's a choad.  urlLink The photo's fucking huge, sorry.  I have one photo of a really cool building in Pitt, but I need to crop and upload, which will take place tomorrow when I get out of bed. I'm beat, and kinda in a pissy mood too.   That is all.

      Well no gear oil filling tonight.  The 17mm socket isn't big enough, and they didn't have a 17mm Allen Wrench so I have to wait until tomorrow to steal Don's tool and fix my damned car.  I'm off to take a photo of the enemy, LOL.  That is all.

      Guess who gets to fill her tranny?  Won't this be a fucking riot to watch?  I can't get anyone to flatbed my car to Don's, and I need to work tomorrow, so  I  get to fill my tranny fluid.  I need a 17mm allen wrench, 80/90 weight gear oil and to find where the damned jack point is on the driver side of the car.  Seriously, I love my GTI but this is getting a bit ridiculous.  I now carry regular motor oil (10W30 since it's summer), gear oil, a screwdriver (my hood release), packaging tape (headlight mounts) and zip strips (grille mounts) everywhere I go just in case I need to make an emergency repair.  The car uses hardly any regular oil, but you never know what may happen, so I always have at least a half quart of Castrol GTX in the hatch.  At least my subs/amp are working now (thanks Morgan).    I am taking a nap then going to AutoZone.  I will blog later on tonight unless I'm smushed under the front end of my car (stop laughing).  That is all.

      Yeah, what I thought was an oxymoron actually may turn out to be correct.  Cleveland may actually be fun!!  Anyway, yesterday we drove past the  urlLink West Side Market  and  urlLink Franklin Castle  which is reputed to be the most haunted residence in Ohio.  We also went to Edgewater Park which is a public "beach" area on Lake Erie.  Of course this was all before my tranny decided to die on me.  Grrrrrrr.  I am kind of learning to drive in Cleveland, though, so this is good.  OK, I must sleep as I am fucking tired.  That is all.

      What's that?  Not what you want to hear when someone's working on your computer.  Not really something you want your surgeon or mechanic to say, either.  Yeah, as he's looking into the tower, on the motherboard, he busts out with "What's that"?  Nice.  Thank you, Morgan, for fixing my desktop PC, and for pimping out the Compaq laptop.  I now have three operable computers thanks to you.  You are the rocking PC pimp, and yes, I figured I've now been owned.  At the very least, if I've not been owned, my PC's have been.  LOL  The GTI is still the pimp, though.  Please, stop touching the knob as you really have no idea what the fuck you're doing.  Asshat.  I am going to bed for 2 whopping hours of sleep.

      I wound up sleeping from 10:30 last night to 10 this morning.  I didn't even wake up at 2AM like usual!  My computer was online almost all night, so if you messaged me last night I was in bed, sorry!  Apparently I was tired or something, but then I didn't get much sleep this weekend (not complaining, either).  Totally need to get my laundry washed, and I'm hungry or something.

      OK, this entry will be an outline of my weekend so I don't forget to write anything later on when I have the time and energy.  -Driving to Strongsville at 11PM on Friday night -Driving home from Strongsville around 12:30AM Friday night -Emergency headlight repair in the K-Mart parking lot -Fixing my subs in the fucking Summit Mall parking lot at 1:30-2:30AM -Being questioned by the cops during said speaker repair fiasco -Getting home around 4AM -The Type O way to play guitar -Driving around Canton/Minerva/Malvern/Massillon this morning looking for fucking Cougars and Thunderchicken Super Coupes -Holy crap, a Beretta with painted on hood pins -The Saturn -Driving back to Strongsville at 5:30 this evening -Driving home from Strongsville at 7:30ish this evening -Being pissed off because someone canceled our plans for the second fucking time this weekend  I feel like a smacked ass, but in a much better way than 2 weeks ago.

      I really hate people.  If you don't want to hang out or whatever, that's cool.  Just don't ignore my IM's like a little bitch, tell me you don't want to hang out anymore.  Please, dear readers, never buy an 03 Taurus.  The GTI has a brand new brake line, and he runs like a pimp.  His subs are still squirrely, but at least they somewhat work now.  I went to bed at 10:15PM and woke up at 2AM.  I almost set my alarm for 10AM tomorrow; I thought I had to work.  Duh, it's Saturday.  Going to the Barberton car show again tomorrow (Saturday) night.  I am such a loser.  I think I'm tired again, so off I go.  That is all.

      I remembered what I wanted to babble about.  When driving my Mom's Z34 I must remember that her car is nowhere near the GTI in handling prowess.  I almost crashed her car twice today; not good at all.  Thank goodness the GTI should be home in the morning.  Then I get to dick around with the subs until I figure out what's going on with the bass response.  That is all.

      Chris Pontius is too cute.  I worked today and that's about it.    The GTI mobile was car hauled to the shop today; Don put fear into me, so I did break down and have the line replaced.  I'm supposed to pick up the Rockin' Ride&trade; tomorrow morning before work, so I should get to bed or something.  I need a hobby.

       OK, it's obvious I'm unhinged, but anytime someone says "ren faire" I begin giggling uncontrollably.  The reason why I begin giggling is a long story I don't feel like typing right now, but suffice to say I annoyed the fuck out of Morgan this morning with my giggling.  Sorry dear, I'll try to contain myself next time, if you try to not stab yourself in the back again.  It may be a practice sword, OK dagger, but it's still sharp on the end.  Is that not what you tell me?      Not much went on Monday, Tuesday or today, or what there's been of today.  Monday and Tuesday were spent with the aforementioned jackpipe, and I just got home about an hour ago from his house, so not much is going on.  I did find out that Raffy-dog, Minerva Dave's doggy, died sometime during the night.  Raffy was such a good puppy; he'll be missed.      I didn't sleep for shit Monday night, so I'm beat.

        Ribs Burn-Off sucked donkey ass. Way too many stupid people for me and Morgan, so we quickly departed and went to the Massillon car show instead. Since it was 10PM most of the cars were gone, but we did see a GTX, Satellite, Swinger, SuperBee and a Firebird Formula. At least we got out of the house.  That is all.

You know who you are, and I appreciate you. {/sap}    Tell me that mulletted white trash redneck doesn't have his   own show  .  He fucking does, and it's on A&E; what the fuck?

       OK, I finally fixed my blog code so the emailed posts don't change the font/color of everything else. It's not exactly as I wanted it, but I'm tired of fucking with it and it   is    better than before.    It's helpful to check out all the fancy shit blogger adds to their service. I can easily change the font and font color now, without fucking with my code! Woohoo.    OK, watching MXC...    That is all.

      Finally, I got to sleep.  9 hours of uninterrupted sleep is good.  I even managed to sleep through the landscape guy's mowing escapades, so I must have been tired.  I am now rested and non-crabby, which is a rarity for me.  LOL  I do very much enjoy spending time with Morgan, but we need to start sleeping like normal people.  Staying up all night then sleeping all day isn't conducive to "normalcy" but then when have I ever been accused of being normal to begin with?  Crap, I'm babbling...  I need to find someway to insert smileys into my blog.  Anyone have any ideas?   urlLink Drop me a tip  if you do.  Taking the laptop downstairs; I'll continue in a few....

      Someone did indeed stop hogging the covers, and I did go back to bed (see previous post).  LOL  Anyway, I just got home from Strongsville and I am tired.  I would have been in the house a half hour earlier but I was busy breaking into my own house.  Gotta love that shit...  Remind me to not fall asleep on his couch so that  urlLink Abe the Bavarian Madman  sleeps on my chest.  That could be why I have the headache from hell, since I am allergic to cats, especially Abes.  I will drag  urlLink him  to the Ribs Burn-Off this week (Thurs-Sat).  Oh yes, yes I will.

      Yeah, on my way to Strongsville Saturday night (4:30AM) my car decides to overheat.  I'm like, what the fuck?  He didn't really  overheat , but he did get hotter than usual.  I pulled over at the Sheetz on RT18 and steam was pouring from under the hood.  Turns out I poked a hole in my overflow hose when I tightened my headlight screw.  I am such a jackass.  I replaced the hose, and now he runs even cooler than before.  How I love my GTI...  Back to bed if someone will stop hogging the covers.  That is all.
