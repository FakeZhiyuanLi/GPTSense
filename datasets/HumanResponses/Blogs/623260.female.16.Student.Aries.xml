      i can't cry in front of people anymore emotion is fear fear is vulnerable vulnerable get hurt  tears splash like raindrops onto my notebook in the shape of words  tears well up through dark eyeliner falling slowly between the pages of a book in the words of characters  tears run down my fingers hiding behind hands alone in a corner disguised by my lessons  Never seen Never heard Never felt  Because i refuse pain i refuse to be vulnerable i refuse to fear i defy emotion  because i am alone i can't cry in front of people anymore

      Coaster  Looking up at the ground Looking down at the sky I watch as my time with you just flies by Looping and spinning I feel like I’m flying Oh God can’t we please just try?  Our love is a cursed ride With ups and downs And loops and rounds What I don’t understand Is why we can’t just get off Why we just can’t get off this damned rollercoaster  That first month was the first hill That great climb as things keep getting better and better But then there’s always a fall And of course the rest of the ride With too much going on I’m going to lose it all, Is that why now you never call?  Our love is a cursed ride With ups and downs And loops and rounds What I don’t understand Is why we just can’t get off Why we just can’t get off this damned rollercoaster  All these loops are starting to get to me With it all hitting me at once I’m getting too dizzy I’m thinking about you As I go upside-down again This is really starting to get silly…  Our love is a cursed ride With ups and downs And loops and rounds What I don’t understand Is why we just can’t get off Why we just can’t get off this damned rollercoaster  Now comes the end of the ride The slow stop back at the station After all that action can we stop now? All the flying the looping the hills All the laughing the crying the chills Can I really prepare to take this last vow?  Our love was a cursed ride  With too many ups and downs With too many loops and rounds And now I do understand  How we can just get off Because I’m getting off this damned rollercoaster

      Right, so i wrote another poem, and this is like the first thing i've written in... well, honestly i haven't had time to sit and try to write this kinda stuff for months. what do you think?   Twisting in an arc of  Shimmering pain  watch a picture  Of a young girl  Weeping quietly  Over a pond of glass  taste the salt in her heavy lashes as she  Makes a deal with the devil  Tearing petals from their flowers  All the while making circles  In the still waters  As diamond rain falls  From eyes of black  To waters green  And she creates fountains of red  To see if still she bleeds   Comments and their commentors are loved very much. and appreciated. please send them to Delirious_dreaming@yahoo.com

       yes, i know it's not a poem, but... it's something new. i may change this to a blog for my stories and stuff too.  I am the girl next door. The epitome of “just a friend”. Just your best friend.   Remember me? We played pirates together. Running, chasing, yelling “ARR!” with our newspaper hats on. We collapsed in the shade of that huge tree, it’s stagnation shielding us from a blazing sun. It held that old tree house, remember that? We spent hours and hours up there, spying on the neighbors, spending the night, sailing our ship. We built it together, you and I. Well, alright. We had a little help. But it’s got our names carved into it, in the corner across from the door, with the rope ladder.   I am the girl next door, remember me? I’m the exception to the “Girls have cooties” rule. We used to hold hands, while we learned to skate and bike. I would coax you, always the exemplary friend. I’d watch you, watch out for you, as you tried things I wouldn’t dare until you had.  	I am the girl next door. Remember me? We started junior high school together. You shared all your fears with me, and we’d drown our sorrows in video games and a bag of chips and a two-liter of soda… Each. I censured your negative behavior, but my ephemeral lectures always just went straight over your head. And besides, I can never stay mad at you… you always pull those puppy dog eyes and I melt. Even now I still melt.  	I am the girl next door, remember me? I’m the one you crammed for finals with. My didactic presence always guiding you through, helping you pass without a single glitch. We always opened our grade cards together, at the same moment. And we’d hug each other excitedly, and my heart would leap. It always felt fit to burst out of my chest!  It was always just platonic for you. I’m the girl next door, you’ve known me since we were in diapers.  	I am the girl next door, remember me? I’m the one you started high school with, jumping up and down at freshman orientation, “IT’S FINALLY HERE!” we shouted together, before you ran off to find your guy friends and I was left alone. Mentally condoning your behavior, after all… it’s just a guy thing, isn’t it? Turning to look for someone, anyone, to latch on to so I wouldn’t be that pathetic girl who stood by herself at orientation.  	I am the girl next door, remember me? I suffered through seemingly endless cycles: I like her Help me get her I love her Help me keep her I hate her Help me dump her Always ending with “Whew I’m glad that’s over! I’m off girls for good! Well, not you of course. No one fits me like you do!” Over and OVER and OVER until I was ready to SCREAM with the insanity of it all, dealing with your fastidious “it’s all about me” stage. I wanted to jump on your roof shouting “I’m right for you! See me as more than the girl next door!”  	I am the girl next door, remember me? I’m the one who was compliant, allowing you to use me, hoping you would mitigate the blows. You never did.  I am the girl next door, remember me? I’m the one you went to homecoming with because you couldn’t find a date. “Please come with me?” you begged. “I wouldn’t have fun with anyone else” you pleaded, with those puppy dog eyes until I was forced to give in. I bought a dress at the last minute, remember? I used up most of my savings. I was breathless in anticipation, hoping for one compliment, one word of extravagant praise, glowing when you handed me a corsage. “You look nice” you commented, casually. Because I’m still that girl. The one next door. With the jeans and the skateboard? One of the guys. 	 I am the girl next door, remember me? I’m the one you dropped sophomore year. You found that pretty cheerleader more your type, going to parties and football games, forgetting all we had. Your expedient nature overwhelming my profuse attempts to stop you, and my excuses did nothing. Worthless prosaic words that did nothing to divert your attention from her short skirt and overstuffed boobs. You didn’t ignore me at home, of course. We still fixed computers together, and every once and a while we star gazed. I’ll never forget those nights, sitting out on your patio with a bag of chips and a few sodas, watching for shooting stars. I saw one once, and you know what I wished for? I wished for me. For you. For us. I know that if you’d just give me a chance… just one chance. But I’m still just that girl next door.  	I am the girl next door, remember me? It was my voluntary tutoring that got you through AP Chemistry. Of course, I told you not to take the class in the first place, science has never been your strong suit. You’re that same kid that tried to tell me that wind blew because the people in Canada were blowing out their birthday candles too hard. And after we finished your homework you’d always ask me for advice, never managing to offer astute words of wisdom in return. I didn’t mind. You were talking to me, at least.  	I am the girl next door, remember me? I rode in your limousine to prom, I went with a friend of yours, remember? You told me he was a great guy, and that if we went in a group we’d have a blast. You spent half the ride there making out with your cheerleader. I sat awkwardly with my hands in my lap staring at the floor because my date and I had nothing to talk about. He also dumped me as soon as we got there in search of some alcohol and someone cooler. You failed to warn me about that one, didn’t you…? Yes, yes you did. I was the one who ran off to find my female friends to hang out with, to rant to.  You never came to find me. Oh, I’m sorry. I remember now, when you came home the next morning you didn’t go home, you came to my house. You talked and laughed and replayed all your favorite moments from the night before. If I remember correctly you asked how my night was once, apologized for the bad tip, patted me on the back, and continued your own story. Oh well, you were excited, I guess. It’s understandable. Not pleasant, mind you, but a fact of life.  	And now we’re finally graduating. I won’t be that girl next door anymore. You’ll have to find a new person do dump upon, to play with, to get advice from. You’ll have to find someone new to give you your imagination, to laugh with, to cry with. You’ll have to find someone fresh to love you through all your faults, to shake her head at you while you fall down. Someone else to bring chicken soup to while she’s sick, to tickle when she’s sad. Someone else to sing to, just to make her laugh. Someone else. This was my confession. My release of what I’ve wanted to tell you for… oh, about forever and a day. This is pretty much goodbye, dear boy next door. I’m going away to college next year, and you are too. You know, you never even asked me where I was going? It may be a very long time before we run into each other again. I will have let you go by then.     Unless you have something that you need to tell me too.

      So much depends on this one chunk of plastic this one test without grade my  future revolves around the color this shows in completion and not just my future  So i wait holding shallow breath wide-eyed unfortunate opposite of innocence sitting in the dim on the edge of the bath for something to appear. It's like staring into a crystal ball it's  mezmerizing i get nervous as things register i close my eyes and prepare to pray to rejoice or be crushed to be quieted or made loud to be happy or to cry it appears   It's positive.

      The world fades to gray with the crush of the city and the country and the politics and the world and life's vibrancy melts with the rain of the tedium of february I wish only for one thing only for spring to bring with it the promise of beautiful red of colours  Next year at this time I'll buy rose coloured glasses

       A constant dream   It still haunts me My thought train backtracks and lingers I am alone in a field and can feel the grass between my toes and the wind in my hair with the Fluttering of my sundress into space endless no trees no houses no flowers no one else just  me and grass and too bright sky, too bright day my hands twitter in nerves around my abdomen full with new life of myself and  someone                             Distant

      How easily swayed by long blonde hair and someone blessed in the bank department so they can afford those "Natural Blessings" in the chest department  So those of us      Starry Eyed           Dreaming Staring silently through   Dark eyelashes reddening when acknowledged                 Smiling       Replaying scenes in Not        so                            Distant     Memory on repeat                   In dreamrest        Ignored.

      I can't write anything but sugar. There's nothing except  artifical strawberry in my mouth and my brain is cotton candy and with it flowing out of my ears it's blocking  inspiration and my heart is rock candy crystalized and not pumping emotion        Life's blood Pumping soda      Sugary          Fizzy              Empty and with the syrup flowing  out the tip of my pen       I'm sticking to the page and i can't write anything              But              Sugar

      I don’t want to hear about yesterdays The good old days when We could be together When things remained naught but Me and you Simplicity You talk like We could go back like Things could be erased And we could put up a crystal Stopper and pretend that Nothing happened and you can Be my prince again and I can be A beautiful princess trapped  In this crystal room Things sparkle and reflect but Behind the mirrors there will always Would always Be the pain of the present And the less distant past and Eventually we would realize how Sick it is and shatter the walls And in would float spirits Of agony and realization And shards would rip us apart  Shards that turned out to be simple plastic And clothes would tatter Food would rot And we’d be forced to once again Confront reality. You can’t go back  You can never go back.

      Heather Utsler Final Health Project (Subject: Cutting) May, 2004 Glimpse into the life of a Cutter  	The Victim gets up at 6:00 for another day in hell.   She untangles herself from the sheets and shivers as the cold air hits her bare legs. She stares at herself in the mirror for a moment, looks away ashamedly and pulls a robe on, completely covering her body. She looks up again and pushes her hair away from her face, trying to ignore the dark circles under her eyes and the chapped lips, and the freckles that dot her nose. The flaws, in her mind. She pulls her door open and steps quietly into the hallway, padding down to the bathroom. She steps into the hot spray and tries to ignore the feeling of the scorching water on fresh wounds. When she’s done she pulls the robe back over her body and puts her hair up in a towel. She gets ready for school, sighing and sincerely hoping that she’ll miss the bus and won’t be able to get there, or that no one will wake up and she can sneak back to bed.   	Not that this helps. She’s perfect. The perfect child, the perfect ideal teenager, the perfect student. She wouldn’t miss the bus, wouldn’t sneak back to bed, and wouldn’t go against her parents’ wishes.  	The Victim slings her backpack over her shoulder and winces as it hits the cuts slicing up and down her upper arms. She grabs a roll and her keys and lets herself out. She walks a block to her bus stop and sits down with loud music and waits for her bus. When it arrives she carefully avoids her fellow students eyes and sits down near the back of the bus, alone, and keeps her headphones back on to ensure her “Don’t bother trying” appearance.    	When she gets to school she quietly puts her things in her locker and waves hi to her friends, putting on her mask, putting up her façade, smiling to avoid questions and walks with them to class.   	She’s been doing this for years. No one suspects a thing. Not her best friend, not her boyfriend, not her teachers, not her parents, not her pastor.   	She works through classes, answering the questions asked of her with unwavering clarity and completion, with as little words as possible. At lunch she sits with her friends, and laughs and jokes with them. She cuddles close to her boyfriend, eats a normal lunch, and finishes the HW she let slide the night before. When the bell rings she waves goodbye to her friends and kisses her boyfriend. She walks to her next class, which is advanced something or other. All of her classes are advanced. It’s expected. She sits down. Not in the front where she’s in the view of everyone, Not in the back where people are always called on, but in the middle to the side. None of her friends are in this class. The Teacher comes in and announces that as soon as the Homework has all been put on his desk, there will be a pop quiz.  	The Victim forgot to do her homework. The Victim freezes. The Victim fails the quiz.  	When normal people fail a quiz they move on and try to do better next time. When the average student fails a quiz they laugh it off with their friends and figure out what they did wrong so as not to do it again. Even when typical anal-retentive students fail a quiz they request extra credit and hope not to fail the next one. The Victim cannot function as a typical student, the Victim is otherwise, The Victim has a problem. She can’t just go with it, can’t just let it go, must punish herself. So The Victim excuses herself from class and lets the mask slip, lets the walls down, unleashes her problem. She pulls out a compass in the bathroom and slits at every concealed piece of skin she can, that’s not already covered in small scratches. She dries the blood, washes her hands, and calmly walks back to class.  	Still no one knows, still no one suspects.  Still no one asks.  	The Victim puts herself back on automatic pilot and finishes the school day. She waves to her friends on her way out, and as if in reverse from earlier removes her things from her locker and walks through masses of people hugging and kissing and laughing on her way to the bus. She puts her headphones back on and imagines that she is at a concert, surrounded by complete strangers, and able to be totally uninhibited. She closes her eyes and tries to picture what life would be like if she could start over, what she would do, and what it would be like to live her own life. She wanted to imagine a life, instead of the life her parents wanted, or her teachers knew she was “Capable of”, to live as she wanted instead of what her friends expected. The bus lurches to a stop and she quickly and quietly picks up her things and nearly runs off the bus in her hurry to be unnoticed. She unlocks the front door and drops her stuff at the foot of the stairs, on her way to the living room where she checks the messages on the answering machine. There is one, on her mailbox, telling The Victim that her parents are going to be late tonight, and to make her own dinner and “not to wait up”. She rolls her eyes, and progresses to the kitchen where she scopes out food possibilities. Deciding there is nothing of any quality in the fridge or the pantry, she decides to invite some friends over to study and order a pizza. She calls them and a few of them can come, so she tells them to be there at 6, and continues on her way up to her room, grabbing her bag on the way.   	When The Victim gets upstairs and opens her bag to start her homework. She gets about halfway through and stops being able to focus. She tries for another few minutes and then stops, takes a breath, and fishes around in one of her drawers for a razor blade. She begins the process of enjoying the cut, her game, her life. She has cut parts of her stomach and around her elbows when she hears the downstairs door open. She had forgotten the small, insignificant fact that both her boyfriend and her best friend knew where the spare key is hidden. She hears her best friend call “Hello? We’re here, are you upstairs?” and the sound of footsteps on the stairs.   She has finally been caught.  	She shoves the blade under the bed and attempts to cover, to conceal, to hide, to put her mask back on. But it’s too late, the strings have been cut, the mask has been broken, and the shards have been thrown away and there is no where to hide. The door opens and in comes her best friend, followed closely by her boyfriend.   	They pause, staring at the horror in front of them, and then as one they kneel and envelope her in deep hugs and when she finally begins to cry, to unleash months and years of pain and terror, they let her. They let her tell, they let her out of the locked room she’s been hiding in, they listen. And then they clean up and cleanse her wounds, and her boyfriend kisses the tears off of her face, and they get ready to call her parents, to call for help,  To face the world again, to face the world head on, to face the world together.  To live.        	A/N: In my research I found that those who cut are often victims of abuse, whether emotional or physical, or victims of rape, and are often either withdrawn or overly social, and can often be consumed by an eating disorder. I decided that it would be more reflective of the gravity of situations like this to add a sense of anonymity to the character, and therefore to simply call her The Victim. Regardless of whether they’re doing it for show or for real, whether they were abused or not, whether they’re anorexic or healthy, cutters are victims. Cutters can be victims of actual physical problems, or victims of emotional problems, but anyone who would take a sharp object to their skin is the victim of an idea; the idea that pain can be fought with pain, that cutting is going to make things better, that self-harm and self-mutilation are going to somehow keep them from having to face the world.

      Inconsolable Surviving first steps Childhood revival When personality is  Formed all over again Losing you was Losing myself. Who  Am I without You without Us?  When mood and  Light or dark depended purely on Situations beyond control Beyond understanding Now gone so  Alone finding My own self my own  Person my own time and Place and memory now Depends on me And not you And not  Us and I don’t Know how to  Be myself be me  Be alone Without you.

      I shove past the guy at the door and squeeze my way into the nightclub. There's no need to get my hand stamped; I won’t be drinking. I won't be there that long. I stand with my arms crossed, against the back wall on my tiptoes as tall as I can, as I try and catch a glimpse of you, and fail. The crowd is too loud, too raucous, too in love with your image. They're too enthralled by your music, your grace and the way you get close to the mike when you get nervous, the way you look down at them individually as though they too were your girlfriends. They're too much in love with the way your radiate pure sexuality, with your bedroom eyes and your sexy half smile when you hit your favorite lyrics, especially the smutty ones. You can't see me. I can feel the rhythm of the bass; the drums beat and thump deep in my chest, and the cymbal crashes ring in my ears.   You start to play the one song you've taken the time to write for me. Can you feel my eyes? Is that why you started it? I choke down clouds of smoke and move up into the crowd, knowing that the pulsing beat and the thick air will find their way into my nightmares tonight, although I take comfort in the fact that you still play my song and choose to ignore the smog. I can see you for a moment, as if frozen in time, before the mass of bright leather and plastic makes its way and swells to the stage again.   This is a nightly trip. We've not seen each other in weeks. I finally get close enough to the stage that I can fully make out your features. That stubble on your chin that tells me you forgot to shave this morning, the necklace with the ring I gave you on it. I can begin to make out the small crescent shaped scar above your eyebrow, but I might only be seeing it because I know that it's there. I love the way you run your finger over it gently when the song is over, and sigh, shaking your head slowly and the way you tug on your collar when you mentally prepare for the next song. All habits that used to annoy me beyond any words you could say, any buttons you could push, and now little things that drive me wild.  Slowly the music starts to take over again. I forget our fights and squabbles, and all the time we spent apart, and our small problems, and all the other reasons I'm really here tonight. I find myself dancing along with the crowd, slowly at first, and then truly a part of the music. The beat works into my arms and legs and my head swings as though of it's own will, and I find myself pulled into the movement of the crowd as they live and breathe the music. They don't see me. Even with the glaring colored lights in red and orange, the blinking strobe light, and the crush of sweaty, drunken bodies surrounding me, no one notices I'm there.   You start an upbeat, especially loud song that I recognize as a set ender, and I start to make my way again to the back of the room. Once I get there, I lean against the wall and listen to the gradual climax of the song, and then to the over the top drum solo that signifies the end of the piece. I begin to make my way to the door when you begin to talk. "Normally that would be our set ender" you say "But something happened that changed my life, and I needed to sing about it. This is 'Could it be any harder' by The Calling. This is for my muse, my lover, my best friend, my Innamorata."    You left me with goodbye and open arms A cut so deep I don't deserve You were always invincible in my eyes the only thing against us now is time  Could it be any harder to say goodbye and without you, Could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true If I only had one more day  I lie down and blind myself with laughter A quick fix of hope is what I'm needing And now I wish that I could turn back the hours But I know I just don't have the power  Could it be any harder to say goodbye and without you, Could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true If I only had one more day  I'd jump at the chance We'd drink and we'd dance And I'd listen close to your every word, As if its your last, I know its your last, Cause today, oh, you're gone  Could it be any harder to say goodbye and without you, Could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true If I only had one more day  Like sand on my feet The smell of sweet perfume You stick to me forever, baby and I wish you didn't go, I wish you didn't go I wish you didn't go away To touch you again, With life in your hands It couldn't be any harder    	I paused at the door with one hand on the frame. I took in my surroundings, knowing I'd be back the next night, and the night after and every night till we're together again, just watching over you. I bowed my head. "I love you too sweetheart, Il Mio Innamorato" I whispered. But no one heard me.  It's hard to hear the dead.
