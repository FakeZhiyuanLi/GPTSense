      Not much happening today.&nbsp; Same old usual day to day stuff.&nbsp; Tonight Mykee has 2 ball games so we will go to them...It is always fun to go and see him play after him not playing in so long....and for those of&nbsp;you who know him you know that of course he is going to be the best looking and in the best shape of all of the other players...that is his style...he has been practicing his batting this week because last week they didn't do so well...they lost both games and he is not a very good loser!! haha&nbsp; Anyway it should be fun to go and watch... I don't know why but I have not felt like getting out much this week, which is unusual for me...i usually go every chance I get but this week I have been such a homebody...since Saturday I havn't wanted to step outside!! maybe Im going through something..who knows....anyway my kids are about to wake up so i had better get going!!

      Well the concert was really great and we had a good time!!&nbsp; Hanks Williams Jr was good and so was Kidd Rock..Like i said I am not a huge fan of either so they sang a lot of songs I didn't know but I still managed to try and sing along!!&nbsp; haha&nbsp; After the concert Catrina and I went out but ended up going to eat and coming home early.&nbsp; Saturday we got up, went and got Parker and then headed off to Pappasito's!! (Catrina's fav...she never comes that we don't at least eat there once!!)&nbsp; Then off to the mall for a little window shopping...then we came home and Catrina got her stuff together and headed out home...Sunday I did absolutley nothing...did not even get out of my pj's!!!&nbsp; so how was everyone else's weekend?

      Finally Friday is here and I am so excited!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonight some friends and I are going to see Kidd Rock and Hank Williams Jr!&nbsp; This will be a first for me.&nbsp; I am not a huge fan of either one but I do enjoy them both.&nbsp; Kidd Rock is kinda special to me and a friend of mine because we had a friend that died this year and he had to be his biggest fan so tonight may come with some tears of rememberance for our good friend.&nbsp; After the concert we will probaly go out to a club or something.&nbsp; I won't have my son so I am going to take advantage of that...No other big plans for the weekend.&nbsp; Hopefully it will not be spent trying to get over tonight!!&nbsp; Well I have a lot of things to do today so I will go for now!! I hope everyone has a safe weekend!!  &nbsp;

        Well I am going to try out this "blog" thing...&nbsp; I don't know exactly what i am going to blog about yet...my life is pretty boring ....&nbsp; I am a nanny...i keep 3 kids plus my own...one is 8, one 3, one 2 and mine is 2...so when i say boring i mean in the adult sense...it is definatley not boring in the "kid world"... right now i can hear monsters inc. in the background but i also can hear all of the yelling and fighting ...we have one extra kid today....but that really doesn't make a difference after 3...well i better go and break all of them up...please let me know if you like my site..

      Well our weekend starts on friday so we all headed out to splashtown for the day...I took Parker there a few months ago and he seemed to have fun so he was really excited about going back to the "big swimming pool"  We had a great time and will probaly try it again soon...Parker has started a new saying...he says "know what mommie?"  and then preceeds to show me something he is interested in...it is so neat to see him actually saying things that other older kids say...he is getting so big so fast...Papa Eldridge bought a big above ground pool and we played in that for awhile this morning...Now Parker is in my lap grabbing my face saying HEY ASH...so i had better go tend to him!!

      Well with the help of a friend, Hanna, I have decided to change my blog...I was getting stumped on what to write everyday so I decided to dedicate my blog entirely to my son...so from now on each day will be an update on all the cute or terrible little things that he has started doing...he is very smart so don't be surprised or doubtful when i post things that he has done!! lol :)  He is being really whiney today for some reason... He is very attached to me and likes to be held a lot and today that hasn't really been possible so he is not the happiest camper...At this moment he is napping...Before I would always rock him to sleep...every single day...keep in mind he is two so this should show you just how spoiled he is.....but now I have started to lay him on a little pallet and let him watch a movie until he falls asleep...his new fav is Spiderman so I have seen it oh lets say a trillon times in the last few weeks...He is also becoming very bossy and I am not taking to well to this...I do not like other bossy kids therefore do not want mine to be the same...any suggestions on how to stop the bossiness?  Sometimes it is cute but he still gets into trouble because like i said it is not something that i like to tolerate!!  Well i gotta finish up some stuff before he wakes up so bring on the comments with suggestions to stop the bossiness!!

      Yeah I know...I haven't even had my blog 2 weeks and already I am behind on my entries...sorry!!  but let me get to my weekend recap.... Friday night Amanda and I went out for a relaxing kid free dinner...We went to Outback steakhouse and it was soooo good...not only the food but being able to eat without kids crying was very relaxing!!!  We had a few drinks which was very relaxing for us both...Saturday we ventured off to Canton...For those of you who don't know it is a gigantic flea market of sort that is 4.5 hours away....it was neat but we didn't have near enough time to see it all...have to go back when we can stay a whole weekend....Sunday was a family day...Mykee's mom came over and cooked a delicious meal and we all kinda went to bed early...not much else to say...be back later
