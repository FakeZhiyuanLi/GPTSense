      Today is my favourite day at school, because i didn't need to carry a lot of books, and it is also Sofball Day!!!! I was so happy untill i forget to change my clothes before going down to the field.Hehehe.... Today we have an Illegal Sofball Match(because there was no teacher around) with the girls. Hehehe... I was the pitcher for the boys group, and my first pray for today's match is Jessica!!!! Followed by Khadijah(KD), Atikah and the others(can't remember coz there were so many of them). They asked me to be gentle with them that is by throwing the ball very very slowly at them. Hmm... What else to do?I throw the ball very very very slowly lah. Hehehe.... the girls team is quite good, but when it is my turn to bat, i mannaged to make a complete homerun. HAHAHAHA... But when i hit the ball, the ball almost hit Khadijah and Illiany at the head. I am SO SORRY!!! KHADIJAH AND ILLIANY, i didnt mean too. SORRY!!!! BUT!!! that was the beginning of the incident. About a few minutes later,when itn is time for the boys to bat the ball, suddenly there was a a few words that says, "Alamak!!! KENAPA NI!!!" because one of my friend accidently loss his grip at the Sofball Bat(Remember KD, it is a Sofball Bat,not a Sofball wood hehehehe....) and hit at my friend, "A"(i wont give his real name ok). He passed out for a few seconds i think, but when we carried him to the "Surau" at our school to make a clean up, he suddenly open his eyes(Fuh.....). His eyebrows are bleeding very badly untill there was a crowded sound again that sound "Masyallah!!" because we noticed that his skin at his eyebrows is torn(OUCH!!!!). A teacher came rushing in, to see what is going on. The teacher was also in SHOCK!!!!! The teacher said that my friend "A" must received a few stitches(double OUCH OUCH!!!!!) So the teacher bring him to the nearest clinic at Beserah, accompanied by Afif(O.... i almost forgot!!! HAPPY 13th B'DAY Afif!!!)and Sha-Sha. About an hour later, our hero came back from the clinic. He look like a Pirate(Hapuskan Cetak Rompak), hehehehe.... Everyone ask him( especially the girls lah... what else... )" Macam mana? Sakit tak?", "Aduh, pedih tak?", "Ok tak kau ni?" and many more. Fuh..... am i writing a book or what? Hehehe..... I think i stop here today... If you want more information about my "A", please write at my beautiful SHOUT box(thanks KD)ok? Bye for now.... See you all very soon, because there must be a lot of stories out there, and i will write as much as i can(I wonder if Khadijah can beat me writing a lot of words today). hehehe BYE...... Akum!!!
