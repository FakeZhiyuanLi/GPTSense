       Work!! Work!! I hate my workplace!!! Well for one my car stereo got stolen from work over the weekend while i was working...I wold have saved myself $300 my calling off...Aurgh!!! Now they are causeing major problems with my vacation time...have place rented and they are saying they CANT give me the first weekend of my vacation off. I'm about to quit. Well update on projects..I totally ripped out the shawl i was knitting and decided to crochet it up but i don't think i took into account the stretchyness of the yarn so it's down to my feet...it doesn't really matter though because I just wanted it for me to use while I was at home. Maybe I'll post some pics tom.
