      &nbsp;&nbsp;  Scripture: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaiah 23:6-9 (from “The Message” Bible)  6Visit Tarshish, you who live on the seacoast.Take a good, long look and wail--yes, cry buckets of tears!7Is this the city you remember as energetic and alive,bustling with activity, this historic old city,Expanding throughout the globe,buying and selling all over the world?8And who is behind the collapse of Tyre,the Tyre that controlled the world markets?Tyre's merchants were the business tycoons.Tyre's traders called all the shots.9GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies ordered the crashto show the sordid backside of prideand puncture the inflated reputations.  &nbsp;  Observation: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, so I know what you’re thinking. What does a prophecy about an ancient city being destroyed have to do with me? My answer: a whole lot. Tyre was a seafaring nation built around the coast of the Mediterranean. It was one of the richest and wealthiest nations of the day. The problem was they believed they had attained all of their wealth and prominence in the world by their strength alone. That being said; how have we gotten where we are today? Some of us are proud of the place we are at today whether it is spiritually, mentally, socially, physically, etc. Some of us aren’t. No matter the case, each of us can point to an area of our lives that, in which, we have excelled. Our dilemma arises when we forget the One who birthed us with these abilities. We point to our talents and “gifts” and then so as not to appear prideful we do as any good rock star would, “First, I’d like to thank God for being the inspiration for this #$%&amp; album.”  We give God some sort of postured lip service and continue in our pride. Tyre did and look where they are. The beautiful thing about all this, however is: He loves to watch us use our talents and gifts because He formed them in us to bring Him glory. When we are operating at 100%, and remaining humble before Him, we are bringing our God glory.  This is important for us as Eastgate because we will be successful. Our “success” will be because we have lain on our faces before God and remained humble as He builds this community of faith. He will bring in the Harvest; not because of any well poloshed worship, or a 3-point exquisitely delivered sermon; but because He is faithful to His promises. If this is the case, then how do I remain humble and still do my best? How will I beat the temptation to become prideful?  &nbsp;  Application: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is found in our willingness to place ourselves in accountable relationships with our peers and mentors. When we open up our lives to the individuals we have invited into this kind of relationship, something amazing happens! We are no longer alone! We have men and women around us willing to drop what they are doing and spend a few moments with God on our behalf. I would encourage us a whole to put our all into these LTGs (Life Transformation Groups) over the next few months. These are the safe places that we can find accountability, prayer, encouragement, joy, and in some cases, even someone to shed tears with.  &nbsp;  Prayer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord, you know our hearts. You see the desire in us to have a real relationship with You. We want the kind of relationship with You that Moses did in Exodus 34 after being with you. “29 When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the LORD.” We want to shine with Your presence! Our peers don’t know You. The only way they will is if we bring our real God into their world where they face real problems. Lord teach us to remain in you and not to trust in our own wit and skill. The only way Eastgate will thrive is because You will draw people to You. I pray for each and every college-career age individual who receives this. I pray that You would seize their heart in Your hand. I pray they would experience You, some even for the first time. You are God. We are your servants. Take us to the center of your perfect will, regardless of what it takes. By your power, Let It Be Done.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Thanks for taking the time to read this. I hope it has challenged you and provided you with a good idea of what our Life Journal is about. I am humbled and honored to lead us into what God has said to be true about EastGate. I have met with some of you and your excitement is encouraging. Please continue to pray for Minette and I, your peers, and for Grace Church. I will be letting you know when we are meeting next very soon but, in the meantime, if I haven’t met with you one-on-one please call me and let’s schedule something. Also make sure we have a time set up to meet in our LTGs! Thanks and good journeys!  &nbsp;  daniel

      Scripture: Psalms 46: 1-3    1 God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, 3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.    &nbsp;  Observation: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t know about you but, if I saw the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains crumble into a large gap in the earth… I think unlike the author of this Psalm; I would be afraid, very, very afraid. How can the author make this statement? What reason can this guy say “we will not fear?”  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He knows a secret:   &nbsp;   7 The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.      &nbsp;  Now let’s translate this into our modern day lives.  &nbsp;    1God is a safe place to hide, ready to help when we need him.2We stand fearless at the cliff-edge of our daily jobs,courageous in failed relationships and our attempts&nbsp;at continuing education3Before the rush and roar of our finances,the disappointments that shift our souls.    &nbsp;  I don’t know about you but, I feel better already.  &nbsp;  Application: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is it that has us paralyzed in fear?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  “Can I live up to God’s call?”&nbsp;  “What if I mess up?”&nbsp;  “How do I tell others?”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  “Is God even there?”&nbsp;  “All of these bills…”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  “I sinned…again…”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As long as we live in fear, our spiritual journey is stalled out. Today I want to step back and look at my life. Today I will examine my life and search my soul for any fear that would immobilize me. I will give my concerns to God. I will cast my daily cares and worries onto the shoulders of the One that knows real burdens. I will sip green tea at Armageddon.  &nbsp;  Prayer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord, today renew my spirit. Teach me to be still in your presence. I ask that your will would be done in the lives of those in this college/career community. I pray that no matter what it takes we would find our selves in the center of your perfect plan for our lives. Continue to guide and direct our Pastor, Sam Rockwell, in all he does and bless Grace Church through his leadership. I pray, Lord, that you would speak to us about the changes you want to make in us, and through us. By your power, Let It Be Done.

      The hole in Rachel’s heart is no longer there. No surgery needed; no correction took place; nothing was done by a human hand.  &nbsp;  We’ve all been there: It is the moment that reality has to be redefined because nothing makes sense. You can’t trust your senses. You must be hearing it wrong. “What did you say?” Then your entire body goes cold and you shiver as the hair on your body rises to take notice of this new reality. Subtly though, acceptance rolls across us like a sunrise.     “I’ve just encountered God.”   &nbsp;  That was the case today as the doctor announced he could find no trace of the hole that snubbed at his ultrasound just moths before. Untreated this hole was supposed to, little by little, suck the life from my daughter. She would not receive the proper oxygen and thus, live a life constantly short of breath. Today though, she received her childhood back.  &nbsp;  As I write this my eyes are tearing up remembering the prayers that have reached heaven on her behalf. Countless thousands of words and phrases that, when strung together, amounted to a single question in God’s ears:  “Will you?”  Today we received his answer:

      I got this article from  urlLink www.emergingchurch.info   "Digital Glass "Peder Morgenthaler : Denver, USA[07.04]  Digital Glass is a worship DVD that makes a concious effort to be different to the norm. Adrian Riley, emergingchurch.info's editor, chats with DVD co-creator peder Morgenthaler to discover why...  congratulations on an excellent worship resource in 'digitial glass'. what prompted you and sally to create this dvd?  Well, Sally and I both have a passion for the advancement of worship beyond what one would typically find in most churches. When we sat down to talk about the current forms and methods for worship we would continually return to the lack of quality visual media available to church leaders that could truly inspire and invoke a response. Both of us gravitate towards some of the ancient forms of story, so it became our goal to translate some of those forms, such as the lament, or the Stations, into a visual form using the technology widely available today.  the title of the dvd is a reference to the stained glass found in churches, the original idea of which was to communicate bible stories to largely uneducated congregations through images rather than words. most people these days can read, but do you see a direct link between the stained glass of several hundred years ago and the use of multimedia in worship today?  I feel that the Church's reliance on the Word as text has greatly limited the interaction between us and God. In this post-Renaissance intellectualized world we've turned the living Word into easily digestible study guides and highlighted texts. Yet the grand stories and ideas in the Bible play much less of a role in peoples lives today than they did 500 years ago. Our goal was to give a "face" to the stories, to illustrate the Word in an emotionally engaging fashion rather than to rely on a didactic method of instruction. The images in the stained glass windows were REAL to the parishoners hundreds of years ago because of the recognizable situations and symbolism. We're just providing moving windows imbued with the symbolism of the 21st century.  one of the sequences on the dvd i can see capturing people's imagination in worship is something quiet ancient - the 'stations of the cross'. how do you feel something so obviously associated with traditional Catholic worship translates in a multimedia format?  A couple of my best friends are Catholic, and while I don't always agree with all of their beliefs, I've come to envy parts of their experience. The Catholic tradition places great value on story and sacrifice. "Stations" simply attempts to translate those values of story and sacrifice into a form of music and motion that is at once both accessible and moving. The beautiful and haunting music of Tribe provided us with the perfect jumping-off point.  i'm always interested in the kind of worship that resources such as 'digital glass' grow out of. would you like to share something of your experience of what it means to create relevant worship in our media-rich culture?  It is easy to confuse "emergent" worship with "media" worship. I think that the trap a lot of churches fall into when trying to transition is assuming that the use of a screen and digital projector is going to be the answer. Personally, the most powerful worship experiences I've had involved relatively little media usage. The key is to integrate media as a piece of the worship experience. Think of media as one of the threads with which to weave a rich tapestry. And the media has to be quality. In today's world we are exposed to literally thousands of media messages every day, all produced with large advertising budgets and the latest technology. The media we use in the church has to be of similar quality, else we distract people from the message by the method.  'concrete jesus' is a great title for one of the sequences, and i think will challenge a lot of people's perceptions of the kind of imagery used in worship - especially those who are just discovering the use of multimedia. was this a concious decision to do something different from the 'beautiful nature scenes' kind of worship video?  Absolutely. Most people don't live in a beautiful mountain valley surrounded by wildlife and fluffy clouds. We live in communities. And communities, so matter how small or large, have difficulties and problems, tragedies and hardship. The concept of unconditional salvation and forgiveness is much more powerful when you apply it to real life instead of an idealized version of it. Yes, Concrete Jesus is challenging. Yes, its urban. Yes, its multiracial. But for a lot of people that's life.  i'm sure you must have a favourite moment on the dvd that really speaks to you...?  Having been immersed in the creation of this DVD for over a year, it's hard to choose a single moment. There's a lot of me personally in Digital Glass. But the juxtaposition of Fernando Ortega's gorgeously spiritual rendition of "Give Me Jesus" over the quick urban cuts in "Concrete Jesus" get me every time. There's a driving pulse to life sometimes, but God is always there, too. thanks for your time peder.  i'd like to finish by asking what plans sally and the team at sacramentis.com have for the future. can we expect more worship resources like 'digital glass'?  Well, we certainly hope so. If the response is as good as we hope it will be, there could be more volumes in the future. So stay tuned... I think the church is coming to a critical juncture with all of the changes occurring in the world. Both Sally and I see a lot of potential, and a lot of creative possibilities.

         Scripture: Isaiah 37:15-20 and 1 Peter 1: 3-7  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   15Then Hezekiah prayed to GOD: 16"GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies, enthroned over the cherubim-angels, you are God, the only God there is, God of all kingdoms on earth. You made heaven and earth. 17Listen, O GOD, and hear. Look, O GOD, and see. Mark all these words of Sennacherib that he sent to mock the living God. 18It's quite true, O GOD, that the kings of Assyria have devastated all the nations and their lands. 19They've thrown their gods into the trash and burned them--no great achievement since they were no-gods anyway, gods made in workshops, carved from wood and chiseled from rock. An end to the no-gods! 20But now step in, O GOD, our God. Save us from him. Let all the kingdoms of earth know that you and you alone are GOD."  &nbsp;  3What a God we have! And how fortunate we are to have him, this Father of our Master Jesus! Because Jesus was raised from the dead, we've been given a brand-new life and have everything to live for, 4including a future in heaven--and the future starts now! 5God is keeping careful watch over us and the future. The Day is coming when you'll have it all--life healed and whole.6I know how great this makes you feel, even though you have to put up with every kind of aggravation in the meantime. 7Pure gold put in the fire comes out of it proved pure; genuine faith put through this suffering comes out proved genuine. When Jesus wraps this all up, it's your faith, not your gold, that God will have on display as evidence of his victory.    &nbsp;  Observation:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have heard this story preached more times than I care to relate. One fact however escaped me every time. By the time the Assyrian king reached Jerusalem, he had decimated the rest of Judah! Jerusalem was the last bastion of strength in Judah. King Hezekiah’s reluctance to make a treaty with the King of Assyria was a death warrant for he and his people. He even admitted it in his prayer to God in the verses above. SO why did Hezekiah cry out at this moment in history instead of ignoring God and accepting the Assyrian King’s demand? I have&nbsp;an idea…  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;know the feeling well enough. Everything in life has failed you. Your friends are gone and your finances have been decimated. You just got laid off from your job and your car is on the side of the highway. Your significant other wants nothing to do with you and your dog just choked to death on his favorite bone. Instead of screaming, ranting, and raving something calms you and you stop everything. You pray.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Desperate prayers to God are O.K. The bible is full of them. It is when we realize that nothing we do matters anymore; nothing we could try to do would succeed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Peter 1:3-7 defines this “desperate prayer” theology.&nbsp;It is when those desperate prayers become an invitation for a living God to interrupt our lives and fix what we’ve broken. We become refined by our circumstances. Ultimately though all our trials, and all our “problems”&nbsp; amount to one thing in God’s eyes: opportunities.  &nbsp;    “7Pure gold put in the fire comes out of it proved pure; genuine faith put through this suffering comes out proved genuine. When Jesus wraps this all up, it's your faith, not your gold, that God will have on display as evidence of his victory.”    &nbsp;  Application:  Today I will make sure I am not ruining the “opportunities” in my life by doing to much. I will, in my prayer, surrender my life to Christ again. I will give him: my thoughts, my finances, my spouse, my daughter, my job, etc.  &nbsp;  Prayer:  Lord, you’ve seen the advertisements. They say I am nothing without the latest product or the highest paying job. You however have proven them wrong. You have laid their lies to rest in the death and resurrection of our Lord. Today, I give you all my concerns. I can’t seem to do much with them so, their Yours; just like they should’ve been since the beginning. Change my heart to match your own today. Increase my faith! Take me to the center of Your perfect will; no matter what! By your power, Let It Be Done.

      What are they?   Living life as a follower of Christ can be challenging. It can be difficult to hear God’s voice and maintain personal integrity in our fast-paced and ever-changing world.    You aren't meant to do it alone.     We are called to follow Christ in relationship—both with Him and with one another. One way of discovering and cultivating a deep relationship with another person is through a Life Transformation Group.   An LTG is a simple way to develop a vital spiritual walk that allows the Holy Spirit to change your life from the inside out. It’s a simple tool that you’ll find encourages you and leads you into a deeper relationship with God and int an authentic, Biblical friendship with another person.   LTG’s all have the following in common:   They meet once a week for at least an hour.  They include two of three people.  They are gender specific. Men meet with men, women with women.  There is no leader.  There is no workbook or training needed; just people and the Bible.  Each group strives for accountability and mutual confession of sin, regular personal reading of the Bible, and specific prayer.   If you are interested in creating a Life Transformation Group, your first step is to pray about it. Ask God to show you whom you should partner with, and then wait until He tells you. Sometimes that means someone will approach and ask, you to form a group with them. Or, God will lay someone’s name on you heart to approach.&nbsp;   Second, talk the person God reveals to you. Ask if they would be willing to commit to a regular weekly meeting time with you, and if they feel they can be honest with you about their life. You also need to know if those things are true for you. Do you feel as if you can commit to this other person? Can you be honest with them?   Then, set aside a regular time each week to accomplish the following: Talk about your lives. The Bible tells us in Hebrews 10:24,25 that we need each other. We need to develop relationships that are built around mutual honest confession and prayerful support. Use a set of agreed-upon questions to direct your conversation. Starter questions are included below; as your group develops, you may want to adjust the wording of the questions, or include additional questions that pertain to your individual lives. Be accountable for reading the Bible.&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;Pray for specific people and problems. Each group member should identify two or three people in their lives to pray for. Write down the names of these people in a place you will refer to—perhaps on a bookmark in your Bible. Each member of the group will pray for everyone on the list by name as they read their Bibles during the week. You are also encouraged to pray for you LTG partner and any challenges he or she might face.   Why Two or Three?    LTG’s are limited to two or three people because the smaller size makes it easier to establish community, practice accountability, maintain confidentiality, schedule regular meeting times, and invite others to join in.  Sample Character Conversation Questions:    Have you been an example this week to the greatness of Jesus Christ in you words and actions?  Have you been exposed to sexually alluring material or allowed your mind to entertain inappropriate sexual thoughts about another person this week?  Have you lacked integrity in your financial dealings or coveted something that does not belong to you?     Have you been honoring, understanding, and generous in your important relationships this week?     Have you damaged another person by your words, either behind their back or face-to-face?    &nbsp;  Have you given into an addictive behavior this week?     Have you continued to remain angry toward another?     Have you secretly wished for another’s misfortune?     Did you finish the reading and hear from God? What are you going to do about it?     Have you been completely honest in answering these questions?    Each group member should also create one personal accountability question tailored to his or her life.

      Scripture: Isaiah 55:8-11    8 "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways," declares the LORD . 9 "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts. 10 As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, 11 so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.   Observation:   "despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage    then someone will say what is lost can never be saved    despite all my rage i am still just a rat in a cage "  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Bullet With Butterfly Wings  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LyricsArtist(Band):Smashing Pumpkins    &nbsp; Have you ever seen that fly.  You&nbsp;know the one .&nbsp;It buzzes around your window in a futile attempt to escape the confines of your room or car. You talk to it like it can here you. "hang on, let me open this up." The instant you involve yourself in this hopeless struggle by reaching to open the window; the fly takes off to another part of the house; or it won't go out the opening you've provided. You think, "stupid fly," then go on about your day.   We are that fly. Kind of. God's first thought when we mess up isn't, "stupid human." (well sometimes in my case; he may). He has a plan for our lives. A beautiful plan. He has laid it out for us to discover. He has provided us with His written word (the Bible), His hands for direction (our mentors and/coaches), and motivation (firends and family). Instead we futily bang our head against the window. Then we blame him b/c it hurts. I love verses 10-11. He has promised that his Word spoken over us will not fail. When we align ourselves with Him and His plan we will begin to discover His inevitable plan for our lives. That doesn't make the journey any less painful, it just means we have someone to look to when we find ourselves against "a window."  Application:  Today, I am going to look inside. What am I fighting against? Why? Am I aligned with His plan for my life? Am I a fly? Am I in His perfect will?  Prayer:  Lord, you are my Way. Teach me to walk in your will for my life. I know that I am struggling against somethings that may not be in Your plan for my life. Teach me to hear Your voice. Teach me to let go of my plans and to submit to yours. Walk with our church and this new community of young pilgrims You are building. We submit to your will. Let it be Done.

      This is a SOAP from my friend George Cooper in San Antonio, TX. I wanted to share his observations with you and invite you to make observations of your own. Thanks George!  &nbsp; Scripture: Is. 53:10 "Yet it was the Lord's will to CRUSH Him and cause Him to SUFFER." (emphasis mine)  Observation: Isaiah, speaking of The Christ to come, says that it was God's will to crush Him and cause Him to suffer.  Application: I just cannot grasp the depth of God's love.&nbsp; I do not even know what love is . . . I should not even be allowed to utter the word . . . Truly there are no words to frame how deeply God loves.  In earlier chapters, we read verse after verse about Israel's deep sin and violation of God.&nbsp; It speaks of God's anger so fierce that even after multitudes have been slain and placed in captivity - His anger was not satiated.&nbsp; He remained angry.&nbsp; "His hand was still raised".&nbsp; (Ch. 9)&nbsp;   Until, in the midst of that righteous anger He reminds Himself that He made men, chose them, desires them.&nbsp; Not all of the animals in the world burnt on an altar before Him could turn away this fierce anger but yet He loved . . .   So here we are.&nbsp; He had to crush something - He chose His own Son.&nbsp; Man's profound sin and His perfect holiness had forged an impenetrable barrier between us.&nbsp; Only a perfect Holy sacrifice could bridge this barrier.&nbsp; Right our wrongs . . . Restore us to our God. .   So, God chose to crush His Son, to cause Him to suffer.&nbsp; Not just die, SUFFER.&nbsp; Then the need for perfect Justice was met and we were taught perfect love.&nbsp; This is love.  Prayer: Master, teach me to love.&nbsp; I want to love my wife, my son, my friends, the people I pastor, the lost, my enemies - like you love.&nbsp; I do not know where to begin.&nbsp; Teach me.

      Mission: We exist to see our peers engaged in a synergistic relationship with Christ as Lord and incorporated into  urlLink Grace Church  and its mission.   Values:   Accountable relationships – Christians of all ages are called to live in loving accountable relationships. This generation of individuals however, has a greater need for “real” relationships . They desire this more than anything. This will open any door (James 5:16; Eccl 4:11, 12).   The Spiritual Journey – “Only those on journeys see the dim road home.” Our spiritual journey should never be stagnant and always challenging. Our goal is one thing: to live as He did. EastGate will provide a venue for individuals wanting to continue their journey in Christ (1 John 2:3-6).   Outward Focused Lives - God sent his Son that we might have life. The Son sent the church to the world so that they may have life. This is our call and our mission (Acts 1:8).   Empowered Opportunities – Failing and falling is a part of life. We believe in giving individuals the opportunities to serve with the availability of second chances. This is how our “talents” and skills are honed and perfected.    PHASE I   July 1, 20041 – September 30, 2004   Build a core team of 6-12 individuals (including Minette and I)  Begin to hold mandatory prayer sessions at least 1x per month; maybe 2x month; this will begin in August as we will be working around multiple schedules.   urlLink Have each member of the core in an active and accountable LTG   Begin core team readings with LTG book  This will be the time that the foundational relationships are built. I need to plan events accordingly. I don’t see this as a “bring your friend” time but more as a “will I bring my friend?” time.  Develop newsletter and website for launch during Phase II.   PHASE II   October 1, 2004 – December 31, 2004   Continue to build core if needed; if not begin expanding meetings to include potentials.  Begin preparing for a January launch event  Hold more outward focused events and meetings.  Continue with prayer sessions but move to a mandatory 2x per month schedule (encourage fasting!)  Encourage LTG growth  Begin to promo in services; any available forums  Launch website and newsletter (have someone else doing this)  At least 1 team building exercise  At least 1 community service type outreach  Plan launch details: time; place; budget; restrictions; etc  Make sure there is a system in place for follow up. NO one slips through the cracks!   PHASE III   January 2005 (1 week before and after launch)   Mandatory prayer as often as needed  Final details  Empower team!  Test run: pre-launch, launch, post launch, and follow up  Promo launch  Meet with team for final details, vision casting, and encouragement.  Change/revise launch as needed  Launch  Follow-up   PHASE IV   January – May   Empower team with opportunities to lead  Build the core by 1.5X  Add C.E. to core with new and innovative ideas and books  Plan for large summer event  Plan for weekly service  At least 1 community outreach per 2 months – trash pick-up, park service, retirement home, GET OUT AND GET DIRTY!    1)Real Relationships – These will be defined as loving, accountable connections with individuals whether Christian or Non-Christian. This will be the defining characteristic of our growing community.  2)Core team – This will consist of individuals who are consistent in living in the values in the document above. Not every member of the community will be part of the core team. Everyone however, will be encouraged to participate in the life our burgeoning community.

      There has been so many good thoughts out there lately, let me share with you just one more. This is from  urlLink Jamie at BeChurch.    God, what happened to you.No matter how hard I stare at your face I just can't recognize you these days.You aren't the same guy I met all those years ago when those nice folks took me on a walk down the Roman's road.You look so different, You act so different.     What happened to the upper middle class white Jesus who had all of his $h17 together? What happened to the emasculated sissy who was so preoccupied with my North American comforts that he was constantly waiting for me to ask him to bless me? You don't give a crap about other cultures... the world revolves around us, here, remember!? Christian morals and North America... you founded this place!! Remember???    It's tough looking into someone's face every day for years and then one day not recognizing them anymore. So much is the same, but everything is different. I travel through time, on the road you lay before me, trusting that you "never change", but then all of a sudden, half way down the road I find out that you aren't the guy they told me you were. Your priorities are different, your goals are different, you look different, talk different, man... you even love different!    You're not safe anymore! You're too big, too.... involved!The world you made has to many faces... like a great big diamond and I just can't figure out how you stay the same for each when they are all so different.    It was so much easier when beer was for backsliders and dancing was for whores. Black was black and white was white and I said my little prayers every night. But you... you... arggghh... Did I lose you?Or did I find you?That's all I want to know...   What powerful thoughts. God is not like what we thought, and if we haven't seen him change before our eyes then maybe we haven't been looking at him lately! Just a thought. Thanks Jamie for your transparent thoughts.

      Scripture: John 5:1-9      1Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews. 2Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. 3Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed. 5One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. 6When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?" 7"Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me." 8Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk." 9At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked.    Observation: Today I sat here after reading my Reading for the day and thought.  “there’s something here.”   I didn’t know what it was so I used a little trick I made up in Bible College. I placed myself within the story. I placed myself in the role of observer. I envisioned the tower stone walls and the mammoth colonnades that surrounded this sacred pool. The smell of sickness, vomit, and death reached my nose as my imaginary feet carried me through a waist high sea of invalids and cripples. The pool was shimmering as it normally did at this time of day and the place was rather still; it was Sabbath. As I walked on through the crowd by the edge of the pool, I noticed across the room one man in particular. Jesus. He was there just watching. It was about this time I noticed no one was watching me. All eyes were staring hungrily at the pool. As I stepped in front of one individual in particular I was shoved out of the way,  “don’t block my way, idiot!”  It was then that my heart began to break. The One who made the water in that pool was standing among them. The One that shapes reality and bends it to His will stood mere inches from them, yet no one recognized him.   He began to move through the crowd with a purpose. He stopped far from the pool, by the wall, and spoke directly to one of the men lying there.  “If it were me, ” I thought, “ I’d volunteer to take him closer to the pool. Or maybe, I’d buy him lunch and talk to him about his life. I might even make it my life’s mission to get him into that pool. One way or another I’ll help him.”  So I waited to see if Jesus would comfort him with kind words and a smile, or maybe even a nice touch on the shoulder to let him know he cared. Instead he ordered the man to stand up, grab his bed, and leave. What surprised me even more though, is that the man did. He got up and left. Well, this created quite a stir and by the time everyone settled down, neither Jesus, nor the former invalid were anywhere to be found.  Today I was reminded of Power: real power. With a sentence Jesus healed that man where years of my “tender love and care” couldn’t. In this world we no longer put any stock in the Power of a real God. Instead we will bleed out our lives for people and never really meet their needs. Don’t get me wrong: caring for people isn’t wrong. Doing “things” for people isn’t wrong. As a matter of fact we are supposed to! We are supposed to give to the poor, give aid to the ill, take care of orphans and widow, etc. We can’t do it without the Power of God, if we do; we are just another charity bent on seeing world peace.  There is Power, real Power, in the life of a man or a woman committed to seeing God’s will done in there life. There is more Power in the single solitary life of a surrendered soul than in a thousand hospitals. That Power is available to you. That Power is available to me.  Application:  I surrender…again.  Prayer:  Break me. Take me to the center of Your Will. That is my desire. Let it be done according to Your name.

      One thing I love about the internet is its abilty to make distance into nothing. Here is a SOAP from my friend and brother, George Cooper, in San Antonio, TX...   Scripture:  John 3:27-30  “He (Jesus) is baptizing and everyone is going to Him.  To this John replied “A man can only receive what is given him from heaven.  You yourselves can testify that I said ‘I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of Him.’  The bride belongs to the bridegroom.  The friend who attends the bridegroom waits for Him and is full of joy when he hears His voice.  That joy is mine, and it is now complete.  He must become greater and I must become less.”  Observation:  John had a powerful, wide-ranging ministry.  His disciples saw the ministry of Christ begin to supercede John’s and became worried.  But John, full of humility, spoke a parable to explain how ministry for the called ones works.  Application:  First, John’s disciples remind me so much of the prevailing perspective of ministry today...     These people have a franchise mentality that see others as competitors and rather than focusing on obedience to God in their call make unwise comparisons to the “success” of others.  John’s disciples had becomes deluded in their thinking . . . because good things were happening in their ministry with John they incorrectly deduced that he should be the one to receive the honor and respect.  Beyond that, they saw the success of another minister not as a triumph for the Kingdom but as competition for THEIR ministry, for the hearts and loyalty of people.  Second, John’s parable frames so beautifully the role of those called to lead God’s people.  There is the Bridegroom – the Christ – the One to whom the people truly belong.  There is the Bride – the people – who desperately need the love and care of the bridegroom.  And there is the friend . . . the one who serves the bridegroom and has the privilege of hearing the bridegroom’s voice and seeing the wedding of the bride and bridegroom.  We are the friend.  The best man if you will.  The people we lead are the bride and God is the loving bridegroom.  We NEVER get to see ourselves as the people’s loved one.  That is our Friend and Savior’s role.  We serve Him and we serve them, but we must never come between them.  WE MUST NEVER COMPETE WITH HIM FOR THEIR LOVE.   See, John took pleasure in seeing the bride and her groom united . . . have you ever been the best man at a wedding??  I have had that pleasure and I can tell you that there are deeper feelings of joy when the groom steps up to the platform next to you than when the bride walks down the aisle.  Why?  Because he is your friend . . .   He chose you to be by his side at the most important moment of his life.  You saw him at the bachelor party as he nervously wondered about the days to come.  You saw how deeply he loved her . . . desired her.  Seeing this, our joy is complete.  It is His wedding, His bride, His joy that are paramount.  Not ours.  We must always point her to Him and defer to Him.  Any privilege or adulation we receive from our role in the wedding MUST be deferred to Him.  Any success we are allowed to have is only to facilitate a wedding that is not our own.  The flesh will whisper words of praise to us for our role in the union of God and His people . . . we will be tempted like John’s disciples to set ourselves up as the one, but that pride will be our downfall.  God will not share His glory.  Earthly success in the world’s eyes grants us rights to pride – earthly success in God’s eyes grants us only a deeper responsibility to humble ourselves before Him.  He must increase and we must decrease.  Prayer:  Lord thank you for letting me be your friend, for letting m hear your voice, and for letting me stand with you as you are wed to your people.  Please keep me humble before you.  I will strive to decrease so that you may increase.  I love you.

      An observation from George Cooper. Isn't it amazing! The Spirit reveals different meanings in the same reading.  Scripture:  	John 5:6-8   When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time he asked him “Do you want to get well?”  Sir the invalid replied I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred.  When I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.  Then Jesus said to him “pick up your mat and walk”.   Observation:  Every now and then an angel from heaven would come and stir the waters of this pool...    Once they were stirred, the waters became a miraculous source of healing, for the first person to get into the water would be instantly healed of whatever malady they carried.  There was an invalid man there who had been crippled for 38 years . . . he would just lie there waiting for the waters to stir so he could try to get in again.  But there was undoubtedly always someone less sick, quicker, or who had someone to help them and they would get to the water first.  The bible says that the people would struggle to get into the water first, and this man could simply not compete.  The tragedy of this story is that the miracle was in plain sight, but it was out of reach.  Then as the waters stirred and this invalid looked with agony at those able to claim their miracle a man walked up to him and asked what must have seemed like a ridiculous question.  “Do you want to get well?”  Can you imagine the man’s thoughts?  38 years of longing for this very thing.  Of course!  But I can’t get there on my own and I have no one to help me!  This is when the greatest miracle of all occurs;   God Himself heals the man of both his pain and his sin.      Application:  Contrary to what many teach today, we cannot earn, compete for, or work for the miraculous in our lives.  It is free for those who can let go of the need to control their own lives and solve all of life’s problems on their own.  See, the man or woman who got their miracle in the water received only half of the miracle.  They got healed but they gained no knowledge of their healer.  They got healed but their sin was not forgiven.  They got healed but they did not walk away with the knowledge that their was an enemy vying to destroy more than just their physical bodies he was aiming to destroy their eternities and his method was simple – sin.  The others who were healed may have gotten up and walked away physically but this man got up and walked away spiritually. – speaking the praises of Christ and walking in the knowledge to defeat Satan’s bid for his soul by saying no to sin.    We do not need a short cut or even a miracle, we need the Miracle Worker.  If we walk into our futures without him, all the miracles in the world will ultimately amount to nothing.  For the enemy’s goal is not our physical body, but our eternal soul!  The true miracle is that there is someone who wants to help us and has the power to!  All He has to do is  speak His will into our lives and change us . . . not just for the moment, but forever.  Prayer:  Lord, I am so guilty of crying out to you with all of my needs . . . I need a miracle for this and a miracle for that.  And what kills me is realizing how much you love me and how faithful you are to meet those needs.  But my temporal needs should always serve first as a reminder to me of The Miracle you worked so long ago.  Where I could not help myself, and there was no one to help me, but you came into my life and healed me and forgave me and made me whole for eternity.  Please help me to see all of my needs with that in mind and to always be grateful of what you have done.  I do not want the needs of this life and my flesh to distract me from being grateful for the real need of my soul that you have so graciously met.

      Scripture: Jeremiah 3:2-3 New International Version (NIV)  2 "Look up to the barren heights and see.  Is there any place where you have not been ravished?  By the roadside you sat waiting for lovers,  sat like a nomad in the desert.  You have defiled the land  with your prostitution and wickedness.  3 Therefore the showers have been withheld,  and no spring rains have fallen.  Yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute;  you refuse to blush with shame.   Observation:  	 	During this time, Israel worshipped false gods. They sacrificed animals, money, and in some cases…   their own children to the false gods. God looked at this as saw his beloved people worshipping and giving their hearts to them and called Jeremiah to speak to his people. He likened their misplaced faith to adultery. At one time they had proclaimed their love and never ending adoration for the one true God and now…they couldn’t care less.  	Now fast forward to August 9, 2004. We don’t bow down to sacred trees. We don’t burn incense to a lucky charm. We have other “gods.” We despise and reject our God in new, more civilized ways:  A couple who spends every waking moment together… An Xbox that overheats from overuse… A computer with every new tech. available… Cosmo magazines that dictate our clothing… Cell phones we refuse to turn off… Finances that we can’t get under control (and don’t want to)… All the new gadgets money can buy… Etc…  Is anyone getting this?  Application:  Today I am going to be conscious of the “false gods” in my life. There are times when I care about my wife and child more than my God. There are times that I fight the desire to spend time on my knees and instead I find myself in front a movie that I shouldn’t be watching in the first place. There are times…  Prayer: Lord, today I recognize that there are “gods” in my life that need to go. I also know that there may be some that I don’t recognize. Reveal them to me! Open my heart up to You today. My desire is to know you more! Teach me your ways. Lord, continue to bless Grace church and it’s ministries. I pray also Lord for Eastgate; take us to the place in our collective destinies that you have ordained for this group. Take us to the center of your will regardless of what it takes! By Your name, Let It Be Done.

      Hey everybody! I am here!   Well I finally made it! I am here in Florida! I am going to post an update as soon as my internet is up. Right now I am sitting outside a Starbucks using their WiFi. I miss you all and I can't help but think of Paul's prayer over the church at Philipi when he wrote these words:   I thank my God every time I remember you. In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.  It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me. God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.  And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight, so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ--to the glory and praise of God .  I can't wait to see you all again and continue our partnership in preparing EastGate for the things God will do in and through us. Remember me in your prayers; and please continue to rally around my family as I am gone. Minette and little Rachel need you surrounding them right now. Pray for them and check in on them when you can. I will send more soon but, in the mean time; continue in our Lord and His will. May He place us in the center of his perfect will for our lives...regardless of what it takes. My friends; I miss you all.
