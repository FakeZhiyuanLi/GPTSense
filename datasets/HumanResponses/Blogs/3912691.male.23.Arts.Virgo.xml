       so mel and i went to this coffee "sanctuary" in one of the trendier areas of calgary today. we got a chance to find out who runs the place and as luck would have it it's sponsored by a church of the same affiliation as the one we go to currently. we are going to try and stop by and see the guy who stewards it full time.  we're really excited about the fact that the affiliation is, by some random alignment of the planets, the same. it seems GOD is bringing together some things. i'm not willing to jump to any conclusions but it does excite me!

       i&nbsp;had this awesome conversation with mel today. We talked about wanting to live life for GOD and not for us. we talked about mel switching positions at west jet because it is simply too hard for us to live with her away so much.&nbsp;we dreamed dreams about what our lives can and should look like. I can't wait for her to come home so we can talk more.  &nbsp;

       the more i get into emerging philosophies, the more i see how far i have to grow. the more i learn the more helping people live daily in a way that conveys who CHRIST is becomes a passion of mine. oddly enough something has just popped into the picture that may allow me to both serve with my artistic passions and evangelism passions. time will tell i suppose. i leave it in GOD's hands.

       Our newly amalgamated performing arts team went on a hike today. I must say I'm truly enjoying meeting all these new people. We had a great time just talking, walking, and enjoying creation. We also had some food. I think my dog Tele, made some great new friends and I'm sure he didn't mind the steak, hot dogs and sausages he got today either ;)

        urlLink http://www.theooze.com/articles/article.cfm?id=876   I read that article over at the ooze today. It struck me as being so true and appropriate. It also struck me how the devaluing of women also creates a rampant arena for men to be over-working lust machines. It saddens me that modesty is not valued in society any more. It saddnes me further that I am one of the millions of men who suffer from that sin damaging our relationship with God and our families. I struggle daily with this. I love my wife to death and I know that when I see one of these women and a thought enters my mind, it's dis-honoring to her. It disconnects me from God. I need to be more vigilant.

       I'm currently reading through the purpose driven life with my wife Mel and on day 16 it's all about time. I realized as I read that my time is so valuable and often I waste alot of it on just surfing the net or other meaningless activities when I could be loving my wife or serving someone. You know? There is only so much time God gives me here. I need to use every minute as best I can. Sometimes that does mean relaxing on the net but more often than not it means investing time in my relationships. I think that holds true for all of us.

       Well as per usual on Thursday night I ran a rehearsal for our worship band. Amidst all of the talk of emerging chuch I have to say that I still love doing music that honors God in this context. The community of musicians/Christ-followers that I get to work with day in and day out is awesome. We had a tonne of material to cover last night in a very short period of time and they just rose to the occasion. I love them all dearly.

        urlLink TallSkinnyKiwi: House Churches Have No Sex Appeal   Holy Cow!! I just read Andrew's rant in it's entirety and although much of it I still need to process point 5 was golden. What I am trying to process right now is whether there is a way to do a postmodern ministry in partnership with the mega-church I currently attend. It is disturbing to me that I've heard people call the way we do church currently "crap". So the bride of Christ is crap? If you said that about my wife I'd beat you down right there and then. I don't question that church has to change. I also don't question that God has been working through his church all this time. It's not like God hasn't been in control of every evolution of the church since the dawn of time. Thanks Andrew for your thoughts.

        urlLink richardwhite   I'm not sure that this whole argument against consumer based Christianity is completely valid. If you were to ask the leaders of these churches I think they'd say they were trying to be effective to a certain mindset and generation....culturally relevant. When people have that language so engrained in their heads why not speak that language to increase ministry effectiveness.   The emerging church could really just be doing the same. I know that we have this focus on daily living and such but I think if you asked any pastor at any mega church they think that is what they are doing through their small groups. Are we simply offering another kind of worship (smaller. more intimate and not focused around music) or are we truly doing church differently? The tendancy in us is to see someone with an older view as inferior but we have to constantly be checking ourselves that we aren't simply following the same footsteps and convincing ourselves they've never been seen before.

       Perhaps this will be a long lived, fruitful blog or, more than likely, it'll fade into oblivion some day. Never the less, here is my first post/blog/thought? I'm not even sure what the lingo is in this blog world. I do know that I am on a journey and that I want to document it. So here I am wrestling with what my life is supposed to look like and all of you can get a glimpse into the inner workings of my mind. God help you all.  I want to state for my own sake that this blog is intended to help me sort out how I feel about emerging church and what my role may or may not be in that. Over time I'll try and articulate how I got where I am and let you all know where I am headed. For now, let's keep it short and to the point. God is doing something in my life (and my wife's as well). I am committed to discovering that. That's all I know for sure.

       as i was waking up this morning something struck me as odd. i have my alarm set to 88.9 shine fm and i heard this thing they have called the "church link". essentially, churches pay the radio station to be able to have a 30 second blurb about their church. one church says "looking for a relational church? i'm pastor kelly, come to the meeting place sunday's at 10:30am."  you know, the more i get to know about missional churches and emerging christianity and the more i am drawn to those things, the more i hate hearing stuff like this. i know i am ranting a bit but bear with me. is this what church has become? a 10 second blurb is suppose to get me out to church? i am truly not into the consumerism anymore. i simply want to be church and a follower of CHRIST. i wish the radio station would pull these silly advertisements.

       mel and i saw this movie tonight with some friends. i thought it was a good movie but at the price of movies these days it goes into my list of "great rentals but dubious as to whether anyone should spend $20 to see it on the big screen.  catch the trailer here:  urlLink http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount/the_manchurian_candidate/

        urlLink gapingvoid: how to be creative   again i stole this one from darren at the livingroom. he really is a great blogger. anyhow, as i contemplate the next steps of my life this gives me some things to chew on. basically, gapingvoid provides some excellent motivation for starting some creative (i also think this applies to buisnesses or ministries as well). Here is one of my favroites of the 13 ideas posted:   9. Everybody has their own private Mount Everest they were put on this earth to climb.   You may never reach the summit; for that you will be forgiven. But if you don't make at least one serious attempt to get above the snow-line, years later you will find yourself lying on your deathbed, and all you will feel is emptiness.
