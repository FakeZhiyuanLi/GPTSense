      Wow. I am so tired I can sit through a yelling without emotion. I am drained. I guess that is what happens when I sit around all day. Summers are so dull. Someone take me somewhere where I will meet new people. Do I want to meet new people. Probably not, they would just cause me more problems. I don't know. I am really annoying at times. Hmmm... I am so mad at myself for getting mad. Really, I keep thinking that when people see me, there is this little thought in the back of their heads saying I might go crazy or something. I really, really would never hurt a person. I'm not like that, that just isn't the way I am. I'm thinking that people might treat me different, too. This is mainly directed at Bunni, because she was there, and she saw it. Katie and David were there, too. David wouldn't care, because he already treats me like I'm crazy anyway, and I hardly ever see Katie. Anyway Bunni, are you going to be thinking about that all the time now? It's really bugging me. I am mad at myself for it. It's my dirty little secret.  Hmmm. What else am I doing. Oh yeah, not going to Reel Big Fish, obviously. Tyler is mad at me, but I am not mad at him. He over reacted. I don't know. Maybe he is right. I might be a jerk. He is like my brother, if I ever had a brother. But brothers argue too. I guess we are growing apart. He can drive, and I can't. Things are just different, now. I apologize. Other than that, I had a ball game that I lost for us. (snicker) Haha, we suck though. Wow, that is sad. They put me in for one inning, and I screwed it up. HAHAHAHA!!!

      Well, now. I love these days I have. I'm happy at life. It's so fun and full of stuff. I'm glad I have friends, and it's all just so great. Wow, I am happy. Happier than I have been in a long time. Just so happy. Hmmm... It may all change soon, but I'm not looking to that. Just now. I want all my friends to know that I am glad you are here, and even if I ignore you, and don't talk to you much, I really do appreciate you, even if I don't show it. In other news, I have and anger problem, obviously. I don't like that. I don't really think I do. I know I can control myself if I try. I just get really pissed off, and its only when I skateboard. David, Katie, and Bunni know this. I don't like it. I don't want people to be afraid of me. No one ever. I'm not intimidating either. Well anyway, if anyone wants to give me some advice, do so. What else. Oh, hmmm... Crap. Nope. I still like the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Bill is my uncle. He had 5 heart attacks in one day, and he has recovered now. I went to his house yesterday, and he is hilarious. Good stories exit that man's mouth. Anyway, I wanna have a good day today, and so far it has been borderline. Someone push me one way or another. It's been so plain. I do the same thing everyday. Maybe that's my problem. If I am to be a more interesting person, I should do things different from normal every once in a while. Nah, might take too much effort. Plus, I don't wanna go outside. I'M NOT LAZY. SCREW YOU.

      On this day, let it be known that I am officially a gazelle at heart. I shall skip gracefully away from all forms of danger, and mock them with my extreme speed. Lions beware, for I cause embarrassment. Anyway, today was pleasing for the time I wasn't spending it at home. Truthfully, I love nothing more than being with my friends, and not at my house. My house is where I get yelled at, and we call it communication. So I leap away. Plus gazelles are pretty, and who doesn't want to be pretty? Not me.

      Hey guys, I haven't wrote in this thing in a long time. I was at Kamp Dovetail. It should be in all caps, because it's an acronym, or something. Anyway, Kamp was frickin' fun. Seriously, all you weenie's missed out. Well, actually, Moose and Bunni are the only ones that read my Blog, and Bunni went, so Moose you missed out. Anyway, it was strange in ways too. Haha, but I can't tell you about it. They swore me to secrecy. Other than that, I have fun lots now-a-days. Hmmm... Oh yeah, Bunni is my bestest friend. With an -est.

      Feel my spatula of death!! This one time I was walking to town, and the police stopped me, and it was night time, so they beat me down. They used clubs, and one of them held me down while the other sprayed mace in my eyes. It burned, and I thought I was surely to die, but then I was saved by the mafia. They told me they would protect me, so long as I worked for them, and did them "jobs". So began my reign as the most deadly hitman ever... in Hillsboro. I was a total badass. Really, because I had a shotgun, and I was cool. Once you were targeted by the mafia, you were finished. Then this one time I was on the "job" and this man approached me selling cheese graters. I thought he had a good deal so I bought one. It was very nice, and matched my knife set. So I made cheese nachos. They were hot. Then I remembered I hadn't done my "job" just as a knock came to my door. To make a long story short, I died. Nah, that did'nt actually happen. Or else I wouldn't be alive. Or did it? See, I might have gone out the back door, but they would have thought of that, and been there. Then I would have pulled out my magnum's and shot up the mafia men. I would have hopped the fence, and stolen their car. It would have been painted black, too. After that I would make my way somewhere far away, and start a new life with a new name, and be forgotten. But who would believe that? Not me...

      Well, it is about time this thing works again. My toes are cold, and naked without socks. Today is June 14, and you know what that means... No, it doesn't actually mean anything. Did you ever think that what you are doing right now could be a waste of time. Because today will never happen again. The seconds that just went by are gone forever, and here you sit at your computer, pissing your life away. Awww man, what a great thing to do. Yeah, I don't mind because I don't have much of a life anyway. Heh. Anyone wanna do something today, maybe after 8 o'clock or 8:30. Call me if you have plans to want to do something. Really, because I am bored. Alright then.

      Gob is a super-good band. Anyone and everyone should listen to them. Check them out. Plus, they are from Canada. They got popular in the U.S. from Sum 41. I don't like Sum 41, but I like Gob. They have awesome lyrics. I'm jealous. Well, in other news, I saw the light. I had to put sunglasses on. Nah, but I did really. Hmmm, this day was cool. Killer Miller came over, and I really didn't do much. No one is on Yahoo! anymore. Really that is all there is to do on the computer, too. Come on now, people. Nah, I'm just kidding. Gob man. Happy, happy, oh so happy. I feel like things are almost starting to normalize, if still different. Maybe I'm just getting used to it. Probably. Soccer before long. Robert is doing it, so it will be cool. Anyway, if someone wants to do something this weekend, tell me and I'll see what I can do to make my mother let me go. Maybe we can assemble the "crew". You guys are awesome. I raise my Coke in toast to you.

      9:05 at the beginning of this here Blog. I guess it's a capitalized thing. What should I do this morning. I could go shoot stuff, that is always fun. All I have is a BB gun, but it is still fun. OR I could sit here at my computer, and wait until someone gets on Yahoo! and then I can talk to them. Might be a while. Even if anyone was up right now, I don't think they would get on the internet. They would eat cereal, and watch TV. TV is so boring, which is why I don't watch it. Especially during the week, because they only show either adult stuff or little kid stuff from 9:00 to 2:00. Music is fun too. That is what I am doing right now. Sitting here listening to music. I love music infinitely. Even in my hours of unhappiness it was there for me. Thank you, musicians, for making what it is that you made. Lemonade. Lemon-aid. I love that song. Boy, that song makes me sad a little. I need to talk to Blake. He is cool, and also a good friend of mine. Yessir. Alright, I can't think of anything that I wanna write down anymore.

      Wow, I thought so much about it I got dizzy and passed out. Maybe I shouldn't do that. I never really thought about it before, and it is so obvious. It was a 2-piece puzzle, so I was going to get it eventually. Oh well, not my choice. Hmmm, I should ask, but I would hate to start a feud. Someone help...

      Holy crap, by creating this Blog people (namely Alison) are being very mean to me about stuff. I built this online journal to put my thoughts in. Can I not be picked on for what I feel is important. Like Pepsi picking on Coke. Coke is my "little buddy." Well anyway, I think it's true though, I am a jerk. If you people don't like me or talking to me, just tell me. I will understand, and then leave you alone.

      Well, it seems as though I have missed something that has happened tonight. It doesn't concern me anyway, as I have grown apart from these people what concerned in here, much to my displeasing displeasure. Yeah, you know it. You wanna be my friends, then try calling me on the phone sometimes, and talking to me instead of me talking to you. That is how I feel. Really, I would appreciate someone calling me sometimes. I always call everyone, and if they called me, I would feel like they want me to be around and they are glad to be talking to me. That's how I feel about it, and if you aren't liking it, then go plant potatoes. Wizzle, Izzle lizzle tikizzle innizzle ebonizzles. Izzle's rizizzle fizzle, andizzle I fizzle lizzle Snoop Fizzle. Yo dagety droop. Haha, that was fun. You should try it. Well anyway, jerks, talk to you later.

      Beer-thirty...haha. This butt's for you...hahaha. If I could only stop for a second and think of how immature that was, I might find it not funny. But I am too busy laughing, so I wont. You guys need more fun in your lives. Don't think about how stupid it is, just think that it's not making any sense what so ever. This one's for you, guys, and thank you for all the times I will laugh at that in the future.

      Haha, good morning everyone who needs their mornings to be good. That only applies to people who get up in the morning. A.K.A. before noon. That is approximately what time it is right now. Anyway, today is going to suck. I'm going to be at home all day. Maybe mother and father will wish to go in town whent they come home. That would be cool. I am one happy sponge. Thrice is cool. Killer Miller is cool. I am glad she is around. She helps a lot and is fun to talk to. She understands. She was once a teenager, and then she also raised a few of them. Anyway, I hope everyone a good day. Alright, I'm done.

      Hey guys. Home again and I hate it some more. I cannot stand to be home. Not that I don't like the people in it, but it's just soooo boring. What can you possibly do five miles from the nearest town (which is Hillsboro I might add)? Yeah, that one stumped even... your mom. Heh, great day. Alison is moving :(. That sucks the butt(as Cody would say) hardcore (as someone would say). I don't wish it to happen, but from what I hear that is how it has to be. Well, I hope things work out in the end a.k.a. me spending more time with her this summer. Even though we aren't going out anymore, we are still friends, and I'll be damned if I don't spend as much time with her as I can. In other news, Coke is good. Boycott Pepsi, because it is evil and will make you play basketball, and rollerblade, and listen to rap. Really, it is because they make fun of Coke, which is a bad advertising strategy because they put Coke on the TV, and people see it and think, "Hey, I should try this other brand of soda, just in case it tastes better." That way they can drink Coke and have a happy, non-complicated life. Like me! Well actually, my life has become a little more complicated in the recent times. Oh well, that's life. Bye for now, friends.

      Well hello my dearies. I've spent the day cruising and I cannot see what people see in it. It might be the most boring thing in the world. But I guess when you are sitting in the back of a Jeep that doesn't have a top on it, and then no one is sitting with you, you don't really get to do much talking. That's okay with me though, because I spent it with Tyler and Alison, and no matter how much they didn't talk to me, I was still right there with them. That's all that matters right? Well anyway. There are also other orders of business that I have to not conduct, but watch over just the same. Wow, this is a long blog. Maybe going to be my longest. If not, then poopy oopy. I wish you could make the little faces. They are cool, and when I make them I laugh at them because they humor me. A lot of stuff does. It's not my fault I laugh at everything. I didn't birth me. See how that works, because everytime something has potential to be your fault, blame it on the man above you. Take it from me, as I am the master of bad excuses, and then getting in trouble. Out.

      Here it is, the Sunday that never died. Today has potential to be a good day. I might just make it that. This morning was already hilarious, so we will just see how things work out. I'm hoping to go skating today, and to have a good time with people that are my friends. Well, I hate to type so I guess I am done with this. By the way, it's 12:31, no matter what time it actually says it is.

      Check it out, it's me. Charlotte Brando, the one and only, and don't forget it. Today is June 4, 2004, which would make it a Friday. Well I don't have any idea what I could possibly talk about. Some stuff that has been happening lately, but I would prefer not to. Cry about it. Hmmm, you people should really get lives if you are actually reading this. Really, because what could I possibly say that could entertain the masses. Argh, sometimes I hate the things I have done in my life, but then I can't go back and fix this. Oh well. Something like sadness is what I have felt just recently, and I have to say I don't like it. Whatever.

      Ok, so things are about back to normal. Sort of. Like, I can go spend time with my friends, but it's like probation. I have to be home earlier, and all that stuff. It's alright, better than nothing. I'm having a fun summer. I was going to call my mom today, and wish her a happy belated birthday, but she beat me to it, and told me off for not calling her. Heheh, oops. Her birthday was Thursday. We did send her a card though. I tried to order my book bag just now, and CCS is out of stock on like everything I wanted, so I am not getting my school stuff today. That's fine, Bunny was the one who wanted me order. Anyway, I'm thinking today I probably wont do anything until I get to go to the movies. Sitting at home is alright sometimes, as long as I can occupy myself. Still stuck on Gob, and I think everyone else should listen to them. They make good music. Green Day, too. I'm hoping to get my permit sometime soon. That would be cool. Maybe next week. Bunny wants me to get new shoes, but I don't understand why, because mine are alright, they just have paint on them. She thinks the paint will make people think she is a bad parent. I think she is paranoid. Whatever. It rained a lot. I slept through it though. I have been sleeping a lot of recent. I had trouble sleeping yesterday, though, so I have that excuse. I haven't skated in a while. I think we all should organize a giant skate shindig. That would be fun.

      This morning is promising, and I feel so much better. Sleep, plus talking it out with my parents, plus listening to music helped out a lot. I've had time to think about it. I finished my book yesterday. She led the worst life ever. If anyone should need a book to read, you should read  She's Come Undone , by Wally Lamb. It's a good book, maybe a little depressing. I'm not going to paint today, because there is some rain coming. That's fine with me, but I would like to get the job finished. I don't like the feeling that whenever I am wasting time, like sitting on my couch watching the second hand move, that I could be out doing work. It makes me feel unproductive. That's fine though. So I'm in marching band now. That's... cool. Heh, but no, it really is cool. It's in the morning so now I have something to do. Plus a lot of my friends are there. David, Katie, Cody. Darn, I said a lot of my friends, and named off three people. I don't really know Katie that well, but it would be pretty cool to get to know her better. She is nice and all the jazz. Well, I think I have a renewed interest in Gob, and with good reason. They are awesome. Yesterday I listened to them with the suggestion from Bunni. Thanks...

      Try this experiment... Get up in the morning. No one is allowed to be home. It's 8:30. Don't try to go back to sleep, because you can't. You can sit at your computer, but you can't talk to anyone online, because really no one is. No calling people either. You can listen to music. Sit at home, and then your parents can come home at 3:30. You aren't allowed on the computer after that. Sit with yourself until 8:00. Then you can get on the computer, and do what you please, until 10:00. Then get off the computer, until you get tired around midnight. Do this 5 days a week. I'm sorry if I complain a lot. That is the mother of all complaints, but I'm in a&nbsp;bitter mood. Seriously, unhappy. I'm still complaining. Sorry. That was what I did today. I didn't get to go to Bunni's like I had planned. It's not that I'm upset about that, just I had such high hopes, and then shot to hell. That made me feel bad. I don't why, because I've never been that upset. I am now. That's okay, because I'll get over it. I look forward to tomorrow because it is supposed to rain, and therefore I wont have to paint any. I've done a lot of painting, and any break I can get, I enjoy. Hmmm... I think I'll stay on the computer for awhile...

      I don't like being home alone all of the time. That's how it is though. Really... alone. Everyone else is always busy, so I can't really talk to them on the phone. Oh well, this is the summer. I'm just lonely during the day, that's all. It's my mom's fault, too, because she wont let me do stuff. I don't know. I think I rely on my computer too much. It's very appealing though. It's my connection to the world. Hehe, because I have no other. I'm so, so tired. I don't like being tired in the middle of the day. I would't be if I had something to do. I'm complaining, sorry, I should stop. Complaining is a little hobby of mine, though. It's something I do. My neighborhood sucks, hehe. Green Day. A few people are on vacation and what-not. Vacation is foreign to me. I haven't been on vacation since I was 10. I don't like too, though, because I would rather stay home with my friends. Much cooler, they are. I couldn't stand my family for a week. We have different interests. Tired, tired, tired. I don't really talk to any of my friends at all, except Bunni. They don't call me ever. Cody does actually. I appreciate it when people call me. What else is knew? I might be getting my permit to drive (oh the suspense!) here soon. That's sorta cool. I'm unhappy with my parents right now. They should know better. Today was interesting. I got up to David calling to ask me to go to marching band. I did. Then I got home, and I say down, and waited, and called Bunni. Then I talked until we hung up, and then I went and painted. I got done around 4, took a shower, and called Bunni back. Then I tried to go to her house, but my mom said no, because she sucks. She can be nice on occasions, but is better known for not being nice. So then I talked to her some more on the phone (Bunni), and then hung up, and here I sit. I might plan something tomorrow. The same thing as today, except with me going to Bunni's instead of getting turned down by the Bunny. We will see... I need a hobby, but then I realize nothing interests me. Find me something new and entertaining. All who should read this is stuck with this job. I'm out of subjects again...

      I've always looked at myself, and thought about myself as an old(sorta) person. But then I was thinking about it today, and it seems as though I'm only 15. I still live with my parents, and I'm not quite old enough to save the world yet. I'm not ready to grow up I realized. I'm not ready, nor do I want to. I just want to be me for now. Wow, I'm very happy with my life. I'm still thinking complications are ahead. I hope it isn't too bad. Hehe. School, that is something I'm just not ready for. Maybe it is. I want to see my friends, but it's going to be so different. I'm afraid of missing out on some drastic change. I don't want to be left behind. Maybe it isn't me left behind, just others going ahead, I don't know. I just hope for the best. I really need to play some guitar. Hehe, I think I will now.

      Comments, Anyone? Hehe, well today promises boredom. That's my day. Well, what happening here is I am tired, and it's completely the fault of outside. I like overcast days though, but I think the air is too moist. Someone outta fix it. I don't much care for the fog either. Hmmm, there was a Halo party yesterday. Everyone wanted me to go, but I didn't. Everyone being the population of guys that I hang out with. Robert, David, Cody, maybe others. Anyway, I'm sure it was great fun. Other things... Nope, can't think of any. Someone wanna do something, because I'm checking my schedule, and I got nothing. Oh well...

      Wow, would everyone like to know that I like Green Day? Awesome. Well, today was interesting enough. I think that I say "hmmm" too much, so someone get me another thought phrase. I just say it too much because I don't really know what to say next. Oh well good enough. This post is really a waste of time, but I didn't want my blog to be old. You know how it is. It's nice to be updated.  P.S. Snoop fizzle.

      I have paint on my body, and I would feel unclean, but I don't really notice it until someone mentions it. I have to paint my back garage. I'm getting closer to being done, but then Kenny thinks a third coat needs applied. Why would that be so? The can says that this is supposed to be good paint...  Yesterday I went to the movies, and I saw the Bourne Supremacy. I think that's how it's spelled. Maybe not. Anyway, afterwards we rode around in Tyler's "sweet ride" and went to Taco Bell. I didn't get anything to eat there. It might have been because I had no money. Anyway, after that I got dropped off at Bunni's. I'm still afraid of Sassy, if that is how you spell it. Well, I'm only afraid as I enter the house. After that I am fine. Then we went for a walk/sit. And then I went home to get in trouble. I didn't get in that much trouble, because here I am now. I have my one hour of computer time. I wish I could use the phone, because no one is on the computer. Emily left, didn't she? Wow, hmmm...  What else is knew? I have new socks on. I have this streak going. I've had new socks on all week. Just so appetite that I went to the store, and I bought a lot of socks. Killer Miller thinks "bought me" is redundant. It doesn't necessarily have to be so though, because you could say bought, and be talking about how you bought it for someone else.

      I'm so happy right now, and it's awesome. I'm listening to Green Day. Music has a way of sometimes making me intensly happy. Green Day is coming out with a new album, and it's gonna be awesome, and it is called American Idiot. I can't wait. WOOOHOOO!!!

      I just got out of the shower, because I was just painting. I'm not sure what I hate more though, painting or window washing. I don't like to do either of them at all. I'm about 1/10 of the way done painting, too. It's not going to be my profession. Yesterday David and Bunni came over to my house. It was Bunni's first time. It was all fun, and pretty cool too. I don't know though, that half a day is enough time to have all the fun you can with friends. We went for a walk too. I'm really tired, and I got bit by this super annoying bug, and it burns and is all swelled up. My mom said that my friends are alright, and she especially likes you guys because you clean up your messes. So basically, she doesn't hate you anymore or anything. It's cool now. Hehe.

      Hey, I was just looking through my old blog, and I saw some comments, and then I read them, and some of them directed at me just aren't very nice. Well... It rained yesterday, and I love rain. I don't know why. I don't like the sun though. Its' too bright, and I just don't like nice days. I like overcast days. Plus the sun causes cancer. If it didn't provide heat, like if something else did, then it wouldn't serve any purpose except for the earth to have something to rotate around. If I suddenly had a million dollars, that would be kind of cool. I would buy a car, and a guy in a suit, and a nice hat, to drive me around. That way I would have something to do. I'm pretty sure I would have money left over, so I would do something nice with some of it, and put some more in my college thing. Or I could also give it to a few choice friends... Heheh. It's 1116, and I have nothing to do. I was just talking to David Henrywinkler, and he is in some sort of school class thing. That's something to do sorta. I don't know if I would want to be in school though. When I grow up though, I will have to work everyday, so I hope that I find a job I like. Hopefully, I will enjoy coming home too. What if I dislike them both? I'm sure that I wont.  I'm talking about absolutely nothing. It is passing the time pretty good though. The room that I am sitting in right now is going to have new floors sometime soon. Soon being 2 to 3 weeks. I don't know if that will mean I won't have this computer or not. I don't care though. I like David. He is really cool. I think his party needs to be soon. We just need to organize. Pull our resources. I don't know what we need to pull, but I will help out in any way that I can. I think I would fancy reading my book for a bit, but if you want to talk to me, feel free to call my house. 393-4506.

      I get exceptionally happy knowing that I have my friends. It really is a good feeling to know it. Like I look at two people, and they are best friends or something like that, and I think "hey, that's kinda like me." It's a very securing feeling.  I don't like to think of the not-too-distant future, because it holds things that I don't prefer, but I guess they are going to happen, much to my displeasure. Like Bunni moving. It's for the best, I suppose. Plus, it would make her happy. Oh well, you are here now, and that's all that matters to me, for now.  Today went down like this. Got up, David called about band. I said no. Cody called about band. I said no. I sat at my computer until noon, where I got up to see if I could get the phone to call Bunni. Danielle had it, so I ate grapes and cookies. Then, at 1205, I got the phone, so I took it and called Bunni, but she seemed intensely tired, so I let her get her sleep. So I sat at my computer for 2 more hours, well a little less, until around 143, where Bunni called me, and I talked to her for a while. Then Bunny, my mom, got home, and I ate a soft pretzel, and then read my book, started to fall asleep, and then Tyler showed up, so we hung out. He brought me a root beer float. Then he left, and I called Bunni, and talked to her until my phone died, and then I sat at my computer for about one and one-half hours. Waiting... hehe. It's almost time for me to get off the computer, but I will be back tomorrow. If you must know, that isn't just my today schedule, that's pretty much how all week is. I live&nbsp;a very repetively boring life. Will someone kidnap tomorrow, and then return me before my mom gets home. Please... My book is getting pretty good. It is a girl book, well, that is what people say it to be, but I guess it isn't a girl book unless the author meant it to be for girls, but really it can be for anyone if they want to read it. I like it, in any case, and it is quite interesting. 10:00, oh the pain. At my funeral, I just want everyone to smile.

      Yesterday was a lot of fun, because I went (don't know how to spell) canoeing. It was awesome fun, and it was with Bunni. Bunni, I'm sorry I sort of ruined it for you by seeming mad at you. I really wasn't mad at you at all. I don't know, I might have been tired or something. I feel really bad about it though. I didn't mean to. :( After that we went to her house for a while, and then J.D. came over, and we played guitar. Then I went home. We stopped at David's first, and on my exit of his house, I said something really loud, and right in front of his dad. Oops. Anyway, that was how my&nbsp; day went. Fun.

      I totally just got abandoned. Really, Bunni, you just got offline. What for. Now I have no one to talk to. I think I am going to die of second hand smoke. If my kids ever start smoking, ever when they are allowed, I'm not gonna let them do it around me. It's annoying when people just smoke in front of me. I had to put up with it all day. Not so bad of a day, actually. I guess since it was your computer, not you, then I don't care that you got offline. Heh, what's important is that you are back online, therefore talking to me again. Sometimes I don't feel like talking to anyone except Bunni. I'm not exactly sure why. Maybe because everyone else kind of seems like they have better things to do. Or else they would just rather not talk to me. This only applies to some people, so don't feel offended if you feel offended.  I bought the Switchfoot CD yesterday. It has a DVD thing with it. It's cool, because it has Dare You to Move on it. The music video. Hey, yeah, by the way, I used a file and got all of that nail polish off, so we are good. Wow, I don't have any practices or anything at all to do for the entire week. Until the 9th ever. That's cool, but I might be in marching band, so actually I might have to do something. I don't mind though. Hmmm, I guess I got nothing else to say.

      Yesterday was a lot of fun. I went to Bunni's house, and we watched Big Fish, and then did other stuff. We had pizza too, and the sprinkly cheese stuff they put on top of it. I got some on my clothes. It was intense fun though. I really do enjoy going over to her house. It's fun to hang around with her. Hmmm, I got my journal back too. I was reading it this morning, just a little, and I write funny. I don't really notice when I am writing in it, but later when I look at it, it's all written dumb, and really repetitive.&nbsp; I find myself uninteresting. But I guess everything in that little red notebook had truths to them. It's cool. Anyway, what else. I am so tired right now. I even slept in. It didn't rain at my house yesterday, but it did in town. That isn't fair. I like rain. I like overcast too, because the sun is too bright and too hot. I prefer cloudy&nbsp; days. Who's with me.

      Whoa, they did something to the way my Blog is set up. It's looking more confusing. Oh well, I'll do the best I can. So this morning is going to drag on forever. It's only 7:19, and I am already bored. Well, if I could learn to sleep in somewhat late, then I would be able to not waste my day. Oh crap, I just remember I'm not allowed to do wake up calls at all. Wow, I really, really am going to be bored. I always talk about being bored. I haven't got any other subjects. I'm sorry. Yesterday I went skating, and it was kinda fun, too. I don't know. I was a little tired to do skating. It was still pretty fun. I wasn't skating my best either. I preferred when we were at David's house afterwords. Hanging out with Tyler is going to be awkward from now on, too. He might just get mad at anything I say. I think he just needs to calm down, and let things happen. It's not like he's going to dominate my friendship. I want to have other friends.  I need something to do. Call me today sometime, and maybe if you wanna, invite to something, too. That would be nice. There is a break in the paragraphs between friends., and I need. It's there, even if you don't see it especially well. What's more is, my foots hurts.  Well, I am saddened this morning by something, and I'm not telling what.

      Yesterday, after spending most of the day on the phone with Bunni, after she woke up. After soccer, too. Robert needs to start coming to that. Anyway, I headed on up to the ballpark, where I met up with her. We walked around, and John, this one kid we know from Kamp, was with us for not so long, because he went with someone else as we went to Big Lots. We shopped around, and I couldn't touch anything, including glass. After that, we headed back to the park, and sat down, and then I saw my mom, and that was enough to finish up the day, so I left. At home, I talked to Bunni some more until she left to bowling, and then I was bored. Bunni is pretty much the only person who ever talks to me on the phone anymore. Our group didn't last very long. Well, it sort of has, but it has become separated. Tyler is mad at Bunni, and Robert spends time with Tyler, so group things are out. I don't know. I am supposed to go skating today, but no one is calling  yet, so maybe I will call around. Actually, that sounds nice. Calling David right now. Now I'm talking to him. Now I'm done typing.

      Wow, I haven't wrote in this thing in so long. Well, as it is, I am damn bored. I'm still happy with myself though. Bunni, I still believe you should come and kidnap me. I need adventure. If I wasn't so bored, then I would find something to do. But that would get my hopes up. So I wont. Hmmm, what else. I need a life. I don't like going to soccer so early in the morning. I don't really much like going to soccer at all. Even though being at home doesn't really help things. I just need to live in town, or a lot closer to my friends. Town. In other news, I need more socks. Not that giving my tube socks away affected that. I don't wear them. Just I have 6 pairs of ankle socks, and a man can't live off of six socks, let alone me.   Would anyone like a hug?

      You ever had that feeling like you've screwed up. It might not have even actually happened, but it just seems that way. I feel like I'm being ignored, even though really I am not. I just feel kind of to the side. Watching things, and not really in the action. Kind of reminds me of baseball, you know, because I sit the bench the entire game. I don't know why it is, but I don't like that feeling. Ahg, I hate it. Plain outright. Maybe it is caused by boredom. I guess I really do need people. I have a weakness, and it is that. I am nothing without another person to be with me. I don't like lonliness, helplessness, or jealousy. Yes, I do get jealous.   Save me from this boredom. Please. I hate that. Sitting here by myself, in my house 5 days a week. It may seem like fun, because parents are home, so I can do what I like. But there is actaully no fun here. Believe me. I hate this so much. I wish that I lived where my friends did. I wanna live in town.   Tyler is irratated at me again. Not mad, but I know that he doesn't want to talk to me. It was because he said something, and I didn't agree with it at all.   If I were a little child, I would stomp my feet, and then lay down and kick them in the air. I don't like it at all. I'm not sure what it is, but it isn't fun.

Especially when it is for some really crazy, stupid reason. Don't piss me off, or you will feel my squealing wrath. Nah, not really, but I might not talk to you for a while.

      Well, yesterday was totally awesome. I was going to go skating with Tyler at the water plant thing his dad built, but since there was painters there, we decided to come back after a while. So we were heading to some random location, and we saw some guy skating. We thought we would see who is was, because another skater to skate with is always a good thing, and it was Joe. That was like the coolest thing that day, ever! Joe used to go to Hillsboro, but then he graduated, and is now attending Souther State. He will be 20 on the 19th of this month. Anyway, we just all skated, and talked, and had an awesome time for a while. Then my mom picked me up, and so I came back here. It was awesome, I tell you.

      Well, today is stupid. A complete waste of my time. Seriously, I have hardly moved from this spot all day. Nothing significant happened. I guess I am finally getting a hair trimming. I would hate to. Well, I guess it might not be that bad. I don't wanna though. Other than that, if today didn't happen I wouldn't notice. Hmmm, sorry I didn't call, Bunni, but I didn't check anyone's Blogs. I was too busy doing nothing. I got Chuck's yesterday. The shoe. Amazing, isn't it. They are nice. I got pants, too. They are awesome, too. UGGGG. We are out of milk. I drank it all. No chocolate milk. I mix the milks together. That is why we don't have either. Plus, I used the rest of the regular milk to make chocolate milk, because I used chocolate syrup. I have a baseball game today. Wanna come? Just show up around 7:30, and you'll be good and ready to watch me play. That's when I play. Season is over after this week. Then soccer. Now I am mad. One sport to the next, no breaks. I'm not playing summer league next year for that reason. My mom thinks she can make me play. Nope. Too bad. I want my summer for myself. What else. Gonna be getting my permit directly. I'm bored... I got stuff to tell people, too.

      I just got back from Bunni's house. Heh, it was fun. A reminder of why she is my bestest friend. We played Super Nintendo, and I think I am regaining some lost skill. Yep, it is all coming back to me. Hmmm... what can I do. I am home again, and the forecast is looking pretty boring. I know what will liven this party up... Twister!!! Nope, not really. Someone come over to my house and play Monopoly with me. What a fun game. Really, I like to have fun. Hardcore. That's all I ever like doing. That and other stuff. Yep. Other than that, I don't know. Gonna get me some shoes tomorrow. I'm writing about nothing here. Can't really think of anything.

      I feel funny. Heh. Crap, I have this feeling people are getting mad at me. Really, I have no idea what I did. Well, Tyler is mad at me, but that's just because he is a baby. But a few other people, or maybe they just don't wanna talk to me. Or maybe they are just sick of me. I don't know. Any ideas. Offer them in my comments. What else. Today is going to be boring, and it is the Fourth of July. Would anyone like to do something today. If so, call my phone number, and ask for me. Then invite me, and I will ask my mother if I am allowed to go or whatever. Who knows, I might even be allowed. Bye

      I hate my parents with intensity. Really, I don't like to be made fun of. By them anyway. But really, I am sitting here at my computer, and they are sitting in there making fun of me. REALLY, MAKING FUN OF ME! Why yes, yes I am different, aren't I. What is the problem with them. They are jerks. Now Kenny comes out here and acts like he didn't do anything. I'm going to ignore him. I am mad at him. Big time. Good excuses. Argh, can anyone be so annoying. Well, as it is, I am really, really mad now. Enough of this crap. Anyway, I am in a predicament. My life is annoying right now. Someone fix it. I'm offering dollars. Naw, not really. I am going to fix it myself. Just gotta see how things work out. Good golly, I don't like thinking this hard in the summer. I believe, though, that at the end of this day things might work out. If not, there is always tomorrow.

      Heh heh heh... It's the early morning. Wow, I had so much fun yesterday. The only draw back is the constant ringing in my left ear. I think my ear is broke. Blame it on David, for it was him who decided to put us right next to speakers. What were you thinking? Oh well, anyway yesterday was the funnest of all fun things to be fun. Well, the most fun I've had in a while. Yep, I had a great time. I like crowd surfing, and moshing. My back hurt really bad yesterday, because some guy thought it would be cool to put both of his fists on my lower back, and then push me all the way across the pit. Another guy thought I might be able to catch him. Nope. Anyway, it was fun though. I was completely sweaty, and after the show we went and got some Taco Bell. After that, I slept on my bestestest friend Bunni the whole ride home. Actually, she slept on me, and I leaned on her. I did wake her up, because they told me too, and then went to sleep on her. I swear I didn't plan that. I was too tired to think of anything that genious. Anyway, all is well here. Damn my ears, though!

      Friday... morning... Anyway, today is the last day of bandcamp. Finally, hehe... Tomorrow I go to the movies with Bunni, Tyler, and that girl that Tyler always cusses out right before the movies. Wow, I haven't talked to Bunni since Tuesday. Long time, yo. I'm not sure if it was as David said, a no speaking basis, but I just really haven't been in the same place at the same time. Like... I was at band camp, and then soccer, and then Tyler came over. After that, I was at band camp, soccer, and then home, but Bunni was not. Not too sure what's going on. Hmmm... gotta run, be home at 6:30.

      Dude, I am so sunburned. It's funny, but it hurts, but mostly it's funny. I haven't had to shabby of a week, I suppose. I have been at bandcamp. Ewww... bandcamp. Yes, sadly, I do play bass guitar for my school. Haha, at least I have friends to go to everyday. Anyway, I've McDonald's for lunch everyday too. Big fries, big Coke, 2 apple pies. How nutritious. Anyway, I don't really have anything to write about. Like, nothing exciting. I'm just updating my blog so that it doesn't get outdated. I also am letting you know I am still here. Haha, where would I go? Anyway... just wasting time.  And then the techno remix (duh duh digga dugga duh duh dwawmmmm! jugga juh).

      Today was a waste of everything ever. I went to band camp forever, only to do nothing. Really, I accomplished nothing. However, I did see some of my friends. Which is good. I like socializing. David, actually, is the only one I talked to. Anyway, I am bored. I have time to think when I am bored, and that usually leads to bad things. Today was a little better, and I feel good about it. I don't know why. Nothing special happened. I was hoping to do something after band, but nothing was there to do. Oh well... I'm not getting my permit for a while, because I am immature. That's fine. Maybe I am. So...

      Shag, that is a funny word. That's on the list. Okay, well I'm feeling so much better now. 100%. Maybe so. I just needed food, and friends. I took sleep also. I slept under a blanket in 80 degree heat, but I didn't really mind. I just feel so much better. That's about all I have to say.

      427 P.M. I don't know what today is gonna be. I'm thinking nothing at all. I'm not gonna explain it here. I have better things to do. Why am I so unhappy? I was happy just a few hours ago... I think I was. No I wasn't. I was happy yesterday, but I wasn't really. It was fun, and I was having fun, but I wasn't happy. I can't explain myself. I've done wrong... I don't know why I can't just settle with what I have. I'm just so dumb... Oh well... I guess I'll find something tomorrow. I'm just complaining way way way too much...

      There are only a certain few people I like to hang out with. I have it narrowed down to like... only a couple of people. Not very many at all. I'm sorry the rest of you. I do bug people though, and I can't help but be annoying. I am just myself. I know you people get sick of me. Just tell me when you do... I'm very tired. More than that, I'm just... bleh. I don't know the emotion. It's new to me. I have a headache. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I can't explain it in words. Just screaming... Bunni is really busy of recent, and it isn't her fault that she can't ever talk on the phone or anything, but I'm bored, and I need something to do. I want to spend time with her. I haven't really had the chance for a while now. At the movies and stuff, but I don't know... it was tainted. There was pressure of some sort. Maybe not. Maybe it's all in my head. As a matter of fact, I'm sure it is. I just need to let things settle out. I don't have time though, because of this stupid band camp. I only did band because I thought I would have fun with my friends. I do sometimes, but I'm not dedicated, and I don't like it there. I don't like to be at the school, and I don't want to go there, or the fact park, or anything. I don't know. I am a real jerk though. I don't put any effort to hold friendships with some of my best friends, and I haven't cared. Maybe I still don't. I'm on a role here. I also demand like all of other people's times, namely Bunni, when I am sure there are better things to do. Which is why I haven't really been trying to call or push into your life much. I need a hug... Gosh, I can't stand my house. It isn't my mom, I'm over that now. It's this setting, and this place. I can't stand to be here. I don't want to. I don't want to go anywhere either. I am stuck in this position. Maybe I just want people here. That might work. I must say need a lot. I don't really need it, but it is what I would like. It would make me much more comfortable to have it. I can't say what specifically is making me unhappy, but something is. I don't know. Maybe I'll go see if something can be done...

      136 P.M. I'm sitting at the computer here. 137 I had to restart it just a bit ago because it froze. Oh goodness, I have a week of bandcamp ahead, and that is gonna not be fun. 8 to 5? What, do we not have lives. Just because we play instruments? HAHA... wow, that is a lot of music playing. I am gonna be sick of it before too long. I wonder... On this one and only day off I will have for a week, I hope that I can accomplish something fun. I know I will, because I am a master of fun stuff doing. Well, not actually... I'm not writing anything here particularly useful. Hopefully something cool will happen, and I can write about it. I'm listening to music. I like it, a lot... Gob. Eddie Izzard... I watched his DVD yesterday, and it was funny, so that I laughed. The one I remember specifically is "Was that God?" Hehe... funny. 142 I'm somewhat tired, but the good news is I got up early for the purpose of seeing my mother, step-brother and -sister. They are good people. My step-father too. Heh, what a cool guy. He even likes Green Day. A little. He only knows the hits... but I guess it doesn't matter that he isn't a freak about Green Day, as I am. DVD + a,i = David... 145 I finally got finished with the painting. I don't think I am actually gonna be in marching band, because I don't have marching band class. Oh well. School is starting soon, I wonder how that is going to go down. It burns...

      I have a good idea. I realize that Bunny isn't purposely trying to make me unhappy, and that's just fine. The thing is, I was just being unhappy all the time about it. I've decided that it isn't going to bother me anymore, and I'm just not going to worry about it. Like, I'm not going to try to let her bring me down. I have better things to do... I feel better now.

      If I hadn't been introduced to, or in David's case, reintroduced, the friends that I have now in the 7th grade, I would suck. You guys would hate me, and my life would be terrible. I would hang out with the crappy "friends" I used to have, and no one would like me, because I am a jerk. Easy enough. I have to say that in the beginning, I was a jerk in the 7th grade. I'm glad it all happened, and I wouldn't take it back for the world. Although I am unhappy in this house, I am all around a happy character. It helps me to know that I have friends that love me (or at least like me) enough to want to spend time with me. It keeps me going through the day. I need them, maybe even if they don't need me. This summer has been really good. Gosh, I wish I could make things not change. I can't stand it. I am helpless. I hope things get back on track soon...

      Note to all of my friends: You aren't allowed to like my mom at all... ever. She doesn't like you, and she never will. She used to like David even, but she decided that she doesn't like the was he dresses, and so screw how nice he is, so she says. She always looks for something to yell at me for. That was what she decided to yell at me for today. Anyway, I can't stand it here, because of her. I try my best not to argue. Oh well... I guess I can ignore her. Anyway, everyone's been really busy lately. Like uber-busy. Therefore I am forced to entertain myself. Music tends to do it. I like music. Polka and interpretive dancing should be combined. That would be some sweet dancing to sweet music. I gotta go now, because I am in trouble...

      I believe I'm just a little bit paranoid, and I need to ease back just a bit. I'm trying to control how situations are more than just letting them go by, and that is a big flaw. I'm going to try what I can to fix it. Anyway, what else. I'm almost finished with the painting, WOOHOO! I used to be much cooler. Golly, I am bored. What if I had a lot of money? I wouldn't know what to do with it. I might burn it. That would be cool. I probably wouldn't, but there is a small chance I might. I really feel like going out and having intense fun. Subjects, subjects...

      Yesterday I went to the mall with my mom, and that worked a little, because she is being a little bit nicer to me. After that I convinced her to take me to the movies, so I could hang out with Eric, and Bunni, and whoever else might be there, but it was just Eric and Bunni. I don't know...  Today is the last day of marching band, and I don't know what I am doing tonight. Are there plans any?

      Goodness, all I ever see on TV is politics anymore. There is only so much you can say about them. They aren't interesting. Yeah, Bush may suck, but there is only so much suck you can talk about. It gets really boring. I'm not impressed. Though I gotta say this election year does, indeed, "suck". Oh well, America is screwed up, and when I am financially secure, I'm making for the border. Canada that is. Maybe Canandians will beat me up, because I am an American. Oh well, I worry too much. I'm doing my best to concertrate on the right now, because I have a few problems, but they have worked themselves out, but I'm trying to not screw them up again. Bad grammar. Tomorrow I am doing something with my mom, and then something else maybe if I can get so lucky. I'm just writing now, because I am bored. I don't really know what to write about. Tyler and I are friends again. I'm glad. I don't want him to feel left out. I love all my friends, because they have been there for me. I appreciate you guys, as bad of a job I do of acting. Just bear with me. I'm not sure on this job with my mom. It's seeming to work out for the most part. I need to talk to her about stuff, but I can't really, because I can't approach her. She gets a mad face everytime I walk in to the room. She may be just concerned for me, but maybe she should talk to me, instead of forcing me to do things, and being mad at me too. Things are working out for the most part, but I have some other things to worry about, besides my own problems.

      Cocaine is a funny word. Hahaha. Anyway, today worked itself out, and all is well again. I have to say I'm glad. Bunny still gets mad at me, but the ultimate solution is to ignore her. A drastic step indeed, but she is bad for my self-esteem. It's fine. I have to thank Bunni for listening to me whine a bunch, and for putting up with me when I am annoying, and for being there for me, and all that. Thanks a bunch, I don't know what I would do without you. You're the bestest. Hmmm... Pinhead Gunpowder everyone. We like them, and so you should too. We being myself. They are good. I had too much to eat, and now my tummy hurts...

      Gosh, I'm in distress. I have to have a good day, or else I will die. Yesterday went so horribly   wrong. I don't know what's going to happen today. Tyler was yelling at me, and Bunni was trying to help, and then my mom unplugged my computer, and ;ljkasdhg;,asfb. I don't know what's happening. I missed something, and I feel left out because of my mom. I don't want Tyler to be mad at me, but I hope nothing is screwed up. You don't realize how nervous, and pissed I am at the same time. I am sick of my mom. I almost moved out yesterday, but I don't want to live with either of my parents, or else I would have been gone. :( I'm very, very, very unhappy here, right now. I missed something too, and it's gonna bug me forever. I wish my mom would leave me alone. nkl;jkl;fgg I have to get away from this house...

      I give up on my mom, after what she just said to me. I wasn't even talking to her. Just reading a blog, and she just says that! I'm not trying to be nice to her anymore. I'm not gonna go outta my way to make her life hell, either, but I am going to say what I feel, and if she don't like it, well, she deserves it. She's is outrageous. Really, I have to get away from here. I can't stand her at all. What the hell kind of fun is it to make fun of your 15 year old son? Golly, she nees a life of some sort. I need a good mother role model, someone wanna offer some assistance?

How are people today? Good? David guitar is gonna get saudamized, or whatever you spell it like. 1:23, I just got home a bit ago. Band camp isn't very fun. I don't like it when we are outside. It's okay to be inside, but it isn't the best. I'd much rather be somewhere fun. Maybe I'll do something fun today. Anyone want to do something. Contact me if you want to. Please...
