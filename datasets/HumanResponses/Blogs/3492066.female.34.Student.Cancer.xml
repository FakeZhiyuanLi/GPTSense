						   With the Scylding’s Heart    Lord Belheris, God of the Silver-Tongue, bid my humble prayer to pass, written as it is in this imperfect hand of mine own and with a quill that threatens to fail me. Blessed have you made your bards, with the gift of song and story, traveling far throughout the lands to please commoner and king alike. Because of you, Mighty Lord, twinned all the other Gods who have deigned to grace me with their divine favor, my name has been given a greatness the likes of which I have only seen of the heroes of old. Oft have I heard my name carried in long bardic lays that flow from great halls, through public houses, and along the steady rows of soldiers’ tents as they wait out the night before battle. I am even told how at the mention of my name, hope comes to the hearts of the lost, and in battle cries of it rally troops and send the enemy fleeing in terror.   Holy Lord, Most Noble Gods, I, Tanwin Scathach, mother, daughter, sister, soldier, and wife, most humbly beg you to bless me with your art, if only for a time. Grant me that I might tell my own tale, of my own life, as I have lived it, in the hopes that those that I love dearly might learn the truth of it all. For I fear I am becoming a legend, and legends have a life of their own with a light that shines so brightly that a person might be lost within it. So I beseech you, let me tell mine own tale.  For those who might read this, I will admit that though I can be a teller of tales in a pinch, I am no bard, and inscribing tales to parchment is another animal completely, one I am not so sure I can tame. So I ask of you this, especially of my own children and husband to whom I devote this work, have patience with me. Have patience and all shall turn out well in the end.  As with all stories and all legends there is a beginning, heroes being born or sallying out into the world to accomplish marvelous tasks and the like. As for me, though, I shall not start there, for there is another tale unto itself and would only belabor an already difficult task such as this. Instead I shall start in a place far more important to me, in a time and with a peoples that I will say made me who I am. I will say now that my tale is thus: I was ten when I encountered my first battle, face-front and full of blood, but I was no neophyte to arms, for raised in the Citadel of the Scylding, though I was not one, I carried the heart of one, and went roaring into the fight without fear, much to the dismay of my elders, most notably my uncle!  Let me start instead at another beginning, one of explanations, for I fear that I must give them as that so much can get muddled in legend. Bards are good people, but in the end they, like everyone else, prefer a good story to what really happened.   When I was but four years of age, the people I called my parents, the Duke and Duchess Cadwalder, decided to put me in the care of my uncle and aunt, the Lord and Lady Marcan. To be polite, I will say that my so-called parents could not contend with me. It was not that I was an ill-mannered child, for I was always seeking their affections and their approval, but it was as if they could not bare to love me nor to care for me as they did their elder son and daughter. While the Duchess could only look upon me coldly, the Duke could hardly look upon me at all, and then only with such an appearance of profound sadness that it looked as if his heart might break. I do not know what was said, but it was an argument in the night between my them settled my fate, and in the gloaming of the next morning I was whisked away to the Citadel of the Scylding some days away.  I will be as brief as I can be in regards to the Citadel as that there are no doubt a number of tomes written on its purpose and history already, although hopefully I will not be as dry.   The Citadel of the Scylding was originally built as Havenold Castle in the western Wulfingum Mountains to serve as a place of refuge in times of war, as well as a storehouse for arms and a reserve of soldiery. After a time the soldiery became renown for their skills, even surpassing the knightly orders of the kingdom, and soon a military college was formed, the Citadel of the Scylding, and its graduates are given the title Scyld. I would like to note that the only difference between the Scylding and other knightly orders is that while the knights may serve a god or a noble, Scylding serve only the kingdom of Lleogyr and pledge their alliance to no other. For well over five hundred years it has been thus, and even today the Citadel and it’s surrounding town still serve it’s original purpose, and that is where I will finally start my story.  It was early in the winter of my tenth year when the rumors of war had reached the Citadel. For nearly half a century the Merovingas in the north had been trying to invade Lleogyr and its neighbors, led by their dark god, Cwome. They had been bent for conquest, but had been repeatedly fended off, and a wary eye was kept on their borders for their next attempt. It had been quiet for some years, though, as if they had been biding their time, and indeed they had. Heldan, our neighbor to the west, had been overrun and it was only a matter of time before the Merovingas would attempt to make their way east. With the Citadel guarding one of the mountain passes, we had no doubt they would head our way, and neither did King Vortigern. By the end of the winter all the Scyldings had returned to the Citadel from throughout the kingdom, and it was not long before more reinforcements were to come. By the time the first lords had come with their troops, along with the first of the refugees, we had already prepared the city and castle for siege, and kept watch over the wide river valley below.  I will not give a list of all the lords with all their troops to arrive to our defense, that can be found in the history books, but I will make note of one in particular, not because of who he was, but because of who was traveling with him.  As with all the pomp and circumstance that happens with the arrival of nobles in full military regalia, my cousin, Saorla, and I had made it a habit to join the rest of the inhabitants of the Citadel to watch every entry parade that came in. Although colorful, and a rather loud (some lords seemed to have more drummers than soldiers), I have to admit on the whole I was rather disappointed, but only because being raised among the Scyldings, none could best our soldiery, a bias which I still hold to this day.   It was early afternoon when Lord Dunegalan had approached with his troops, and at four years my senior, Saorla had once again dragged me from my perch in the tallest garden tree to go watch their arrival from the gate into the heart of the keep itself. I remember how sullen I was as I watched the soldiers and the knights parade in. The sound of the drums echoing off the walls and towers carved from the mountain itself was nearly making me deaf. My cousin had chided me on looking unladylike, while my best friend, Bran, watched in uncharacteristic silence as the soldiers moved through the gate below us. A wave of my own sadness washed over me, keeping me from arguing with Saorla as I glanced at Bran. War was coming, and his father was one of the Scyldings, and Scyldings never held back from a battle.  “That’s General Hugh ap Dafyth,” Saorla continued in her litany of names of who was who, what their standard was, and why. She may have been schooling to be a healer to follow in the ways of my Aunt Aragwen, but she had an obsessive streak when it came to knowing nobility, and with all the arrivals, it was becoming maddening.  “Yeah, well, who’s that!” I growled, pointing down at the rather small person in new chainmail armor riding next to him.  “Tanwin, don’t be rude. Remember, you’re the niece to Lord Ioanan Marcan, and like me you represent the Citadel to the outside world.”  I would have grumbled something back, churlish as I was at being confined within the walls of the Citadel (everyone may marvel at how massive it is, but to a girl who enjoyed playing on the mountain-side and in the valley, it was terribly small), but my attention was instead held completely by whomever it was riding beside General Dafyth.  At first I wondered if perhaps the fellow was one of the mountain folk that some outsiders call dwarves, but he neither had the broad girth, nor any beard that I could see. He was too small to be the forest folk, the people some call elves, and I was beginning to wonder if he wasn’t something completely else. Here at the Citadel we had more than a few of the mountain folk in residence as teachers, craftsmen, and even a few Scyldings. Forest folk were a bit more rare though, and only a couple I knew lived at the Citadel, purely as teachers, one of whom was my assigned, and beloved guardian.  “Maybe he’s one of those halfling folk that I’ve heard of,” I muttered, watching the horse grow closer, and trying to notice that the person I was staring at was staring back. Even from here I could see his sharp brown eyes. “You know, little people.”  “That’s Carver ap Hugh, you dolt,” Saorla was obviously growing tired of me, as she was want to do being that at her age she had already entered womanhood and I was still a child. “He’s the general’s son, and he’s ten-years-old. Father says he’s going to be admitted into the Scylding academy and start out as a page like all the others.”  I glared down at the boy in armor who by now was glaring back up at me even as he started to ride beneath the main gate. I watched unblinking as the coif of his new armor slid from his head, revealing a mop of wild dark-blonde curls. How I hated him! My husband may laugh to read this, but seeing this boy in new armor riding into the Citadel to be admitted to the academy had struck such a pang of jealousy the likes of which perhaps he never knew. Other boys had indeed come to the Citadel over the years to start out their lives first as pages in their boyhood, then as squires in their teens, seeking to become gifted with the title and rights of a Scyld when they were in their twenties. Young and old, I had known them all, but this one, this one snot-nosed little brat in the shiny new chainmail had gotten my ire up! Never in my life had I seen a page show up in armor, let alone new armor, and bold enough to stare me straight in the eye and not stop staring. Even on the other side of the gate, as I watched him pass into the main courtyard to meet with my Lord-uncle and the Scyldings, he continued to stare back at me over his shoulder.  “You’re just upset about there not being any girls in the academy, Tan,” Bran would later tell me as we dined in the common hall with all the other children that had been brought into the Citadel proper for safety.  “No I’m not,” I lied, acutely aware that thus far there had never been a female Scylding.  “No girl’s been submitted to the academy so far,” he said around a mouthful of bread.  “You mean no girl’s been accepted,” I stabbed at a pea with my knife only to watch the green bead fly into my flagon for my troubles.  “No, I mean that no girl has asked for admission.”  “I can’t imagine why.”  Down at the end of the table one of the kitchen women aided by a couple of pages were tending to the younger of the children. The boy I had seen earlier, Carver, moved past them, only to pause and sweetly ask one of the women for a basket of bread which she happily gave him. No longer in armor, he was now dressed in a finery the likes of which I had only seen in court costume, angelic and perfect in his appearance, the son every parent would have wanted. If he had been closer I would have slapped the smirk from his face when he saw me and ambled back out of the hall with the attitude of the arrogant.   I would have to wait almost two weeks before I could do what I most desired on the field of opportunity, and a true field it was. Outside the Citadel the first skirmishes had begun, but in the heart of the Citadel, in the large castle proper, we children were allowed to play as we liked under the watchful eye of the elder pages, a few squires, and some of the adults who could do nothing else; in the Citadel whole, both city and castle, all served as they could in the times of need, ours was one of only two cities with our own militia as well as army.   Daneball is a favored sport among those of the Citadel, and of Lleogyr as a whole. Played by two teams, the field can be as large as necessary, and the teams as large as desired, with one goal post on either side of the field. Each team has a Quick armed with a padded representation of a dagger, and two Friends who stand a little ways behind the quick armed usually with a padded sword and shield. As for the rest of the team, they can be armed with whatever padded weapon or shield they wish, but until the game begins, they must remain at the goal post they are supposed to be protecting. The goal of the game is of course to get the ball to the opposite end of the field and tag the post to score a point. There are a couple of clinchers to this, though. Only the Quicks can touch or carry the ball, and while the rest of the team is trying to defend them, they are also trying to keep the opposing team from scoring, usually by “killing” the other quick by tagging them with a padded weapon. If both Quicks “die” then the game is at a draw and a new game begins. It’s a bit like a semi-organized field-battle, but with us youngsters it pretty much turns into a controlled moving mob. Just the way I like it!  “Daneball game!” Heldain shouted as he trotted into the garden where most of us were playing, talking, or watching over the little ones. “Who’s up for a daneball game?” he laughed, tossing the ball sky-ward and catching the big thing in one hand. As one of the larger, older pages, he was on the cusp of being chosen as a squire, but for now he was a fun kind of big-brother, and the instigator for most of our exciting group games.  I leapt to my feat, eager for a game, joining the throng that either wanted to watch or join in.  “Why don’t you go play with your dolls, little girl?” Carver said snidely, suddenly stepping into my path.  “Get out of my way!” I snarled, trying to push past.  “Why don’t you make me.”  I gave him a gentle shove to just get him out of my way, only to find him shoving me back a few steps. Angered, I pushed him harder, only to find myself being pushed back hard enough in turn to set me on my rump. I glared up at him.  “What are you going to do, little girl, cry?”  “No,” I said through gritted teeth as I started to get up. “I’m going to hand you your head.”  “Tanwin, he’s just trying to get you angry,” the unshakably calm Bran said at my shoulder. I had known him since I had arrived at the Citadel, and as children of the same age, we had become fast friends and the proverbial bookends. He had never once gotten me into trouble, and never once led me astray.  “Yes, listen to him, listen to your friend. He’s a boy” Carver goaded with another one of his infuriating smirks.  “Tan, you’re my Quick, got it?” Heldain interrupted, taking me by the shoulder and leading me to the field like a guardian brother he tried to be.  I have been reminded on occasion that I am not only rather stubborn, but apparently I have a bit of a temper, and as my husband likes to bring up on occasion when I am worrying over our own children, it was apparently far worse when I was younger.   I will concede here and now that remembering back on this, it is indeed the truth, as a child I had just a little bit of a bad temper, and in that daneball game, Carver got the worst of it. Heldain had chosen me to be the Quick on his team because I was small and fast, as opposed to the skinny runt that a couple of the kitchen-women chided me as being while they handed me sweetrolls aplenty. That day I did not disappoint him, although after a time he as well as the other team captain began to realize something was a bit amiss. It seemed that every time I had gotten my hands on the ball, I kept heading straight for Carver and either barreling over him myself or letting one of my “Friends” do it for me as they fought to keep up. I will admit that no matter where he was standing on the field, I was headed straight for him, deliberately running him over, running him down, or just plain kicking him in the shins to before knocking him over. Daneball is not a game for delicate flowers, and although I can already imagine my dear husband laughing to read this, I indeed had my sights on teaching the snot-nosed boy a lesson. Unfortunately for me, the teaching session didn’t last for long as that the captains decided to put him on my team for the rest of the game, but something rather interesting did happen. Cedric, who was playing one of the “Friends” had gotten wolloped a little too hard and decided to sit out to rest of the game. I don’t know what was in Heldain’s head, but he put Carver in the empty spot, and from then on our side kept winning. Carver had turned into the best “Friend” I had ever had on the field, and a perfect shield-man. By the end of the game I was wondering if I had been wrong about him, and by dinner we were comparing bruises and trading strategies.   Later that night, when all had gone to sleep, and even Bran had gotten tired of my storytelling and was snoring away in the large common room with the rest of the children, I made my way back to my private room in my uncle’s wing of the castle proper.  “Psst!”   At first I wasn’t sure where the sound was coming from.  “Hey, you, little girl,” the brisk whisper made me turn to find Carver standing just outside of the doorway to the common room.  “I’m not a little girl.” The need for sleep had made me surly.  “Well then I guess you need to tell me your name then so I can call you something else.”  “It’s Tanwin Scathach, if you really need to know Carver ap Hugh.”  Even in the half-darkness of the torch-lit halls Carver’s eyes sparkled brightly as he made a sweeping bow. “My lady,” he smiled broadly. “If I may, perhaps I might show you a bit of a trick I have.”  I raised my eyebrow at this.  “Wouldn’t you like a sweet-roll before retiring for the night? The cooks are already preparing them for the morning.”  Sure enough, as I watched from the shadows as he blatantly walked into the kitchen, smiled his most angelic smile at one of the cooks, said something, and was rewarded with two sweet-rolls of which one he presented to me with another bow when he returned to the hall. He had done what few if any of the pages, squires, or scylding had ever done. He had gotten a cook to part with food before the meal was served. I was impressed.  Darkness and sadness descended soon enough even in the haven of the castle proper. The skirmishes had turned into a full-fledged siege, and we knew it was only a matter of time before the Merovingians would get their larger siege engines through the pass. For now they had us sealed within the city walls, and while the fields were still too wet with spring growth to burn, it did not mean that they had no other way of making our lives miserable. Fiery arrows and small catapults were the least of our worries.  One morning as I looked out my window and gathered myself for yet another boring day. I wished for the millionth time my guardian, Peraduer, could be with me, teaching me, playing with me, singing to me in elven to calm my fears, and aiding me in practicing the bow and wooden sword. I so wanted to feel that I was doing something to help my uncle and the people I had grown up knowing and loving as one large family.  I could only shudder as I watched from my high window as more than a hundred Scyldings stood in silent formation on the inner practice fields, fields I had played on only the day before. Fully armored, I saw only the color of gray with the familiar red and cold crest of the Citadel emblazoned on their left shoulder plates. Each face I could see I recognized: Scyld Donigal Hillsfar, Scyld Maelogan Cadwalader, and countless others I had been raised around. There were none there whose names I did not know like my family, only because they had become my family, as had everyone in the castle itself. Page, squire, scyld, forge-master, cook, I knew them all, and at the front of the Scyldings sat my uncle, and beside him my guardian Peraduer of the Green.  At first I thought it some horrible dream, some nightmare come to haunt me as I heard Uncle Ioanan Marcan call the orders. As one the Scyldings put their helms upon their heads, unsheathed their swords, and charged from the field, straight for the castle gates, and the city beyond. Although I could not see them, I could hear the thunder of the hooves, and imagine them riding through the six city gates, charging out of the seventh and onto the field of battle. My world was shattering, being destroyed by an outside force I could do nothing about, and while the people I cared about most were dying, I was being hidden away like the child I was.   Although I do not remember it, I have been told of it. That when Bran and Carver with their uneasy truce came to find me for breakfast, they found instead a couple of the castle guard and my Aunt Aragwen trying desperately to unlock the door as a shrill scream erupted unending from my room.   When the door was finally open it was said that I was found in my bed with my dagger and my bow in my lap, and blood on my hands as I rocked back and forth sobbing and screaming. The window had been broken, and my aunt being the healer she was, recognized easily that I had put my hands through the glass. I had pounded at the thick window so hard that I had broken it with the palms of my hands.  I do remember sitting in the large infirmary of the castle proper eating a bit of bread as I sat on the edge of a cot, wondering why my hands tingled so. I remember saying something about it to my aunt, who was sitting beside me, but I don’t recall her answer. All I know is that was when I heard the shouting in the hall growing closer, and a rushing of heavy footsteps my aunt was off to meet whomever was coming. That was when I saw Scyld Paelan Godswin, Bran’s father, covered in blood and gore with most of his armor gone being carried in on a stretcher, and he was only the first. From there the world became a haze of red confusion as I made room and tried to keep out of the way. Looking back, I know I was in shock as I wandered back and forth in the hall outside of the infirmary door, praying out loud to whatever gods would hear me that all the Scylding would live, that no one would die, and my home as I knew it would be back again, unchanged. Bran stood in pale silence against the wall opposite the infirmary door as Carver tried to quietly comfort us both as best he could. Eventually, he convinced Bran to come with him to at least get something to eat, but I wouldn’t go. This was my family, I thought, and I had to watch over them, praying with all my might to ensure their safety.  It was after they had gone that it happened.  Standing where I was, a frenetic calmness in a sea of controlled chaos, I had heard a scream, a familiar scream, and the sobbing of a breaking heart.	Out of the infirmary Bran’s mother, Teagan, was being escorted, clutching what I assumed to be her husband’s sword to her chest. Two of the healers were trying to calm her, but I knew the truth even if they weren’t saying it. Scyld Godswin was going to die, if he wasn’t dead already, and there was nothing Lady Godswin could do about it. The war had shattered her world.  A shout for help and the arrival of more mangled Scylding summoned the healers away. I dared not look at them as they passed, but only watched Lady Godswin for fear that I too would break.  There is a kind of madness that takes some people when a loved-one dies. It is a madness of action, of violence, of revenge, and protection. It is a hate, a fury, a kind of berserker rage, and watching Lady Godswin, I was bearing witness to it. In a moment she was off, striding down the hall with such a mad speed I was racing to keep up. Out onto the castle grounds she went, out through the castle gates, and through each consecutive city gate. We seemed to be ghosts to everyone, as no one stopped the raging lady as she passed, nor the young girl running to keep up. To my horror, they never even looked our way.  The last of the gates, the one that leads down to the river valley, had been left open but securely guarded, allowing for the wounded to be returned from the battle below. Unfortunately, one of the enemy cavalry had slipped past, and rode up towards the Citadel with amazing speed. 	 All I could do was helplessly run after Lady Godswin, screaming her name as she charged the mounted horseman with sword ready for the killing swing. His was the strike that got in first, though, and as I watched my best friend’s mother, a potter known for her skill and art, drop like a boneless doll with her life struck from her, the rider went past me, leaving me unharmed.   Scyld Donigal Hillsfar made quick work of the man, though, running him through as he charged in unseen from the side. He also made quick work of me, as he grabbed me by the back of my tunic and hoisted me over the cropper of his saddle. I was all I could do not to retch as we went back through the city, although there was little but bread to regurgitate. I had seen war, I had seen death, and I had seen it all touch the people I most cared about.  “Why?” I asked weakly, barely able to breathe let alone speak. “Why Scyld Hillsfar?”   “It’s for your own safety, Tanwin,” he replied brusquely as we reached the castle proper and he pulled me from the saddle as he dismounted and dragged me into the keep itself. “You are a child and you are not supposed to be out on the field of battle let alone close to it.”  “But I can fight,” I protested weakly, looking up at the man I considered second in greatness only to my uncle. “I know how to use a bow. I could shoot from the walls.”  The change of light we entered the keep for a moment created a halo above the cropped blonde hair of the scylding’s head. He frowned hard as he made his way up the stairs, his hard blue eyes flashing in a way I had never seen before. It was not anger. It was something else.  “No, Tanwin,” he answered firmly. “You’re too young.”  “But I’ve learned how to use a bow since I was four. I’m ten seasons old now. I know how to fight. Please, I must go,” I felt my voice growing stronger.  Hillsfar did not reply. He continued to walk, pausing only long enough to pick me up in his arms and carry me bodily towards what I knew to be the children’s common area.  “I can fight,” I insisted, feeling a sudden surge of determination. I had to do something, something to protect my family. “I can use my bow and I can fight.”  “Are you so eager to die, Tanwin Scathach?” Hillsfar growled so vehemently that I actually cringed. “I thought you would have learned by now after your little foray! After what you saw! Lest I remind you Tanwin Scathach, you are a ten-year-old girl, a child, and as such you are to stay as far away from battle as possible. You are to stay with the other children, and in case you do not understand, we are trying to keep you safe!”  I could say nothing as Scyld Hillsfar deposited me at the door of the children’s common room. I stared in at all the little ones playing, oblivious or ignoring the world around them beyond that room. They were innocent, they did not know, they had not seen, they had not grown up within the walls of the Citadel of the Scylding.  “I have to fight,” I announced, turning on my heel to face the behemoth of a man Hillsfar was.   “Don’t!” he pointed a gloved finger sharply at me, pinning me in place. “As niece to Lord Marcan there are certain things expected of you, and one of them is to behave and follow orders. Now be quiet.”  “But I can’t,” I protested as Hillsfar turned to go, just as quickly turning back.  “What has gotten into you, child?” he demanded. “Do you think this siege is some kind of game, your playground to play in?”  “No,” I replied truthfully.  “Then stay here.”  “But I can’t!”  “Tanwin Scathach, I am a scyld, and as a scyld I am expected to be at the city walls right now fighting. Instead of taking on the enemy in combat, I am here arguing with an obstinate child. I expected more of you. Now behave! I will have no more of it!”  “But it’s my fault,” I cried out as Hillsfar turned his back on me to go. “It’s my fault she died! It’s all my fault! If I’d had my bow I could have saved her. I could have saved her!”  Hillsfar looked at me, the brilliance gone from his ice-blue eyes. “Tanwin,” his voice was soft, “you could not have saved Lady Godswin. If you had had your bow, then you would have been a target too. They would have killed you as well. Because you were unarmed, they saw you only as a girl-child, and so they let you live.”  “But I know how to fight,” I could feel the tears slipping down my cheeks. “I have to fight. Everyone with a weapon and training is expected to be at the city wall, expected to fight.”  “Tanwin, you are ten years old, be reasonable!” the growl was starting to return to Hillsfar’s voice. “You’re too young! All the other children of the town have been safely tucked out of harms way in the Citadel, and so you should be too.”  “But it’s my home too!” I nearly shouted. “It’s my duty to protect my home, to protect my people, to serve the kingdom!”  Hillsfar smiled without merriment. “You are not a scyld, you are a child.”  “Then why did you let Lady Godswin fight!” I screamed more to the world at large and to myself than to him. “Why did you let her die! If I had had my bow I could have protected her! But which is worse, not being able to protect those who cannot fight, or letting those who cannot fight into the battle, and getting them killed! She was a potter and an artist, not a warrior!”  Silence.  I could feel my body trembling even as I dared to look at Scyld Hillsfar again. A painful kind of understanding seemed to flick behind his eyes.  “Lady Godswin made her own decision to take up arms, it was regretful,” he said quietly.  “She took up her husband’s sword because he died! She took up Scyld Godswin’s sword because she had her family to protect.”  “She was mad with grief.”  “Was she mad because she went to do what she felt she had to do, that she had to fight to protect her family and her city? Am I mad because I want to do the same? Are you mad because as a chevalier it’s your oath to do exactly what Lady Godswin sought to do, to protect the people around her, especially those she loved?” In silence at the back of my mind I was thanking my tutors for learning how to argue with eloquence even at such a young age. Just because I had not been accepted into the Scylding academy did not mean that I could not learn at least a part of what the pages did.  Hillsfar was quiet.  “I am Duke Cadwalder’s daughter, and Lord Marcan’s neice. I understand there are certain things that are expected of me. One of them is to protect my own people, those of this city, and those that I love and care about. I know how to use a bow. I must fight.”  “What is it that you really want, Tanwin?” asked the scyld wearily.  “I don’t want you to die. I don’t want my uncle to die, nor Peraduer, nor anyone else.” I replied. “I don’t want anyone to die, save for the enemy that would kill us all. I want to be like you. I want to be a Scyld. I want to protect the people who cannot fight, like Lady Godswin.”  Removing his gauntlets and placing his right hand gently atop my head, Hillsfar smiled wanly.  “They say that those with red hair are notorious for their tempers, but I think they’re wrong,” he said as he gently tousled my flat locks. “Perhaps it is not temper, but spirit. Aim that spirit true, Tanwin, and you’ll have all that you need in your life. Aim that spirit true, and I can see you becoming the first woman scyld ever to ride from the Citadel.”  Turning once again to go, Hillsfar paused a moment before adding,  “Until then, Tanwin Scathach, you are no more than a girl-child, and here you will stay until your uncle or your guardian comes for you. Be strong, Tanwin, and pray for all of us.”  In a moment he was gone, leaving me staring after him in silence, feeling unheard but not un-cared for, and resolved to do something.  “Bran’s in the chapel with his father,” Carver said quietly as I found him sitting on the corner of my bed in my room. “He said he wanted to be alone. I don’t know what happened to his mother, they said she just ran off”  I pursed my lips, fighting back the threatening tears as I belted on my dagger, and picked up my bow and quiver of arrows. “Lady Godswin is dead,” I said. “She went to take on the enemy in Scyld Godswin’s place and barely got out of the main city gate.”  Carver was silent, and I didn’t dare to look at him as I adjusted the quiver on my back.  “And what are you doing?” he finally asked after a moment.  “I’m going to do what Lady Godswin couldn’t,” I replied firmly. I would leave no room for argument here.  “And what is that?”  I could feel the fire in my chest, tightness in my jaw, strength in my legs and arms I had never known before. “I’m going to kill those that would kill my family. I am going to kill the Merovingas the best way I know how, with my bow, and from the city walls.”  “Your mad,” his brown eyes were wide.  “No, I’m enraged,” I corrected him. “Now are you going to help me, or do I need to worry about slipping through the city myself. I got through once, now that they’ve seen me and know what’s happened, I don’t think the guards are going to let me through again on my own volition.”  “Just like daneball, huh?”  “Just like daneball,” I nodded.  “Then let’s go!”  I don’t know how he did it, but Carver was true to his word, and as on the daneball field, he had gotten me through the city and to the city walls without incident, and without anyone noticing me. At the steps to the battlements by the main gate, it was another matter though.   “They spotted me,” Carver shoved me up the steps. “I’ll lead them off! Just go! Do it!”  Scrambling up the wooden stares on my hands and feet, I felt my legs and arms go wobbly and my stomach synch up in fear. For a moment I was wondering what in the great heavens had gotten me here, what crazy, childish notion I had as I watched the flurry of activity on the battlement walkway. None had seen me, their attention was out onto the field, and by the sound of it our soldiers were hurrying back in through the city gate even as the Merovingians were reaching the walls. Archers were pulling back on their bowstrings and letting loose as fast as they could while others were preparing the catapults, pots of boiling oil, and other weapons of war.   Feeling the bow in my hand I knew it was time. I was no longer a child. I may not have been a scyld, but like the fellow inhabitants of castle and town, I was not about to let the enemy take what was mine. Still unnoticed by those around me, I found an open space at the battlement and took my place in it, knocking my first arrow and preparing to take aim.  	 I will be truthful and say that when I first laid eyes on the field I nearly lost both my arrow and my nerve. I thought I had seen blood and death in the infirmary and with the loss of Lady Godswin, but it was nothing compared to the carnage I saw now on the ground below. I could not believe it, all the dead, but who I could not tell. Then I spotted my uncle’s shield laying discarded in the mud and my world changed forever as I let loose my first arrow in combat and watched it lodge into a Merovingian’s throat. Power and the feeling of righteousness surged through my veins as I watched the man clutching helplessly at his throat and then fall over dead. I had taken a life to save my people, and I was determined to save more.  I was no helpless child!  My second arrow penetrated a Merovingian breastplate, my third only struck a soft leg, but someone else finished that one off.   Something flashed in front of me, past me, but I paid it no mind as I knocked my fourth arrow, took aim and let loose into a Merovingian’s arm. I was growing frustrated that my aim had not constantly killed a man with each shot, and I told myself I would make time for more practice later.   It was after I let loose my fifth arrow and was watching the results that I realized that a siege ladder had been hooked into the battlement wall right in front of me. As I knocked my sixth arrow I saw an armored shadow rise above me, and as I looked up to take aim I stared directly into the eyes of my enemy, and my rage knew no bounds. Even as he smiled at me, I wondered if the thought he saw only a child with a toy bow, a little nothing girl pampered and preened in the houses of lords and dukes, a little girl whose only worth in age was for a contract marriage to bind two powerful houses together.  The Merovingian waived his sword in the air playfully, smiling and laughing.  My sixth arrow went into his left eye, and when he slowly toppled over onto the battlement, I had time to not only step out of the way, but pull out my dagger. I ended his pitiful wails by ramming my dagger into his heart and twisting, engorged on the hate and the power that moved me.  “I am no child,” I heard myself shout, and then I felt the hands grabbing at me, pulling my dagger and bow from my hands and lifting me off of my feet.  Terror and rage had me shrieking at the top of my lungs for help as I found myself being carried from the battlements. The enemy had taken me, alive, thought me a child, and now this.  “Tanwin,” I heard a familiar voice cry out and I craned my head to see my guardian, Peraduer, upon a horse, arms open and receiving and they received me pulling me up to sit in the saddle before him.  As we rode off back towards the castle, I saw the faces of people I knew looking worried, looking proud, looking haggard, but all looking hopeful. These were the people who had carried me from the battlement away from harm into the arms of someone I considered my second father.  “Scyld Scathach!” I heard someone shout, but Peraduer said nothing as we rode on into the heart of the city and then into the heart of the Citadel itself.  “Down,” he said gently, offering me a hand after dismounting first. I gratefully took, sliding from the saddle only to find my legs hardly under me.  “My uncle,” I gasped, fearful, terrified to the core.  Green eyes smiled gently, knowingly under dark brows. “You saw his shield,” he nodded. “Have no fear, he only dropped it when he was forced to wield a second sword. He is safe. You would have heard him calling orders to the archers to pull back from your position had you been listening.”  I could feel the heat of a blush coming on, the bane of fair skin.  “Did he see?” I asked hoarsely, my eyes cast to the ground.  “Yes, he did,” I heard my uncle reply. Apparently he had ridden ahead of us and was waiting, though I could not bare to look up at him. Though a wonderful and warm man, he was a terror to me in his anger, not for fear of violence, but for fear that I had failed him.   “I see you did not change your mind, Tanwin,” I heard Hillsfar add. “I am disappointed in you.”  “Well,” my uncle said tersely, “what do you have to say for yourself, young lady?”  My head snapped up and all the tears that I had held back for so long turned traitor on me and burst forth. “I am no little girl,” I said so firmly I thought that even the gods believed it. “I may not be a Scyld, I may not be a woman yet, but I sure as the heavens will protect my family and the people of this city. Lady Godswin may not have known how to fight, but I do, and I will!”  “Indeed?” was all my uncle said, looking at me with that calm gaze that told me he was thinking, calculating, assessing, and planning what he was going to do with me next. “And so you have chosen to put yourself and others at risk by placing yourself with your bow on the battlements and taking potshots at the enemy?”  “I was aiming, sir,” I replied, unwilling to yield my ground. What I had done was right, and I knew it to the marrow of my bones. 	 “So you were,” he nodded. “So you were, but were you thinking of those around you? Were you thinking of yourself, or were you just thinking of revenge for the Godswin’s deaths?”  “I was thinking of killing the enemy, sir,” I said in quiet truthfulness as I came to realize what I had done.  “I was thinking of revenge.”  “Well, Page Scathach, until such time as you learn the ways of organized combat, I would advise you to remain here at the castle and to move your things into the dorms. Leftenant Elsdon of Gosfrey will come to collect you at your room, but I will add that you are on probation.” My uncle held up a warning finger. “Every six months I will be receiving evaluations from your teachers and trainers, and I expect them to be exemplary. If they are not up to standards, then I shall pull you from the academy without so much as a second thought. Am I understood.”  “Yes, sir,” I nodded, completely caught off guard by what my uncle was implying, as well as his calm demeanor. Frankly, at that moment I was confused, and apparently he saw it. 	 “Tanwin,” he placed his large hands on my shoulders, “I know you are young, and you are strong, and you are very capable, as well as rather brash. But your heart and your ideas are in the right place. I know why you did what you did, and it was far more than revenge. No, your are not a little girl, you are a girl with the heart of a scyld and with your drive I have no doubt you will attain that title, but for now we must teach you how to aim your energies, teach you how a real battle is fought. Daneball may be a fun game, but it is lousy for the strategies of large groups in combat.”  The siege at the Citadel was a brief one as I later learned, lasting only a couple of weeks as compared to the months and even years other fortified cities had faced. Attrition had caused the enemy to finally flee as death came to them in a three-fold fashion. It was not just those of the Citadel that culled their hideous ranks. Winter winds had come late that year, bringing a killing cold in the night to those caught unprepared. I believe in the end, though, it was the wolves that convinced the remains of the army to leave. Although none in the Citadel had seen anything more than a rare large shadow the size of a horse in the gloaming before sunset or sunrise, we had all heard their howls to the hunt followed by the screams of the confused and dying. In the morning we could see their handiwork and carnage though, and the huge paw prints they left behind.   It was not long thereafter that a herald came from the king announcing the end of the war. He declared no victory, as I remember, only a cessation to the war. The Merovingian armies had left the lands, leaving the kingdom completely, not caring of the dead they left behind. We had survived, those who had lived counted their blessings as they gathered together once again, but we mourned those that we lost.  As for Carver ap Hugh, Bran Godswin, and myself, well, those are other tales for other times when Lord Belheris grants me blessings again. For now, I can only thank Him, and the other Gods who have looked upon me with favor, and finally finish this tale of mine.

						     Grave of the Fireflies (Not Rated)(1988)   Not all anime tales are pixie-dust fantasies or brutal sci-fi standoffs. In Grave of the Fireflies, two orphaned and homeless children set out to survive on their own in post-World War II Japan. But society offers them no help, and they soon realize they can never escape the hardships of war, or even find enough food to survive. Awarded First Prize as Best Animated Feature at the 1994 Chicago International Children's Film Festival.     My Take  :  (4 out of 5) I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie in large part because of it's difference from the happy clappy or overly dark/gothic Japanese animation. Based in 1944/1945 Japan, the story is a simple one following of an older brother watching out for his little sister while trying to survive after the death of their mother due to fire-bombing. It's realistic without being graphic, and I was left with the impression that the writers were ones who either survived World War II or bothered to talk with those who had. Thankfully, this movie is "real" in the sense that it's not out to tug at heart-strings, although the ending is rather sad. In short, it leaves one to question how people in the midst of war, who aren't combatants, try to survive. I also found it interesting how no "good guy-bad guy" mentality pops up in the movie. The Americans are only briefly mentioned, as are the Japanese soldiers, and neither are put in the light of heroic or evil.  Although not rated, I'd say with certainty that children 12 and over can sit and watch this, but that the younger set would most likely be bored silly. Note to parents: you may wish to sit and watch this with your children and discuss what was going on both in the movie, and at that moment in time in Japan.  A thoughtful movie.

						    urlLink    David Thewlis as Lupin in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&nbsp; urlLink     Well, I'm pleased as punch to be going to see "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" at the earliest show available in the city, 11:59 a.m.. Aside from hearing about good reviews for the movie, I also have to admit that I'm grateful that casting didn't put two "pretty-boys" in the roles of Lupin and Black. I've always had a penchent for David Thewlis' acting since "Dragonheart," and of course having Gary Oldman playing Black is perfect. Then again, I've been enjoying Oldman since I first saw him in the deeply thoughtful comedy "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead" with Tim Roth. Let me just say, Oldman is great at playing a madman.  Well, much to my suprise, I'll be going to the midnight show (well, 11:59 p.m.) of "Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban." I hadn't exactly planned on it, it just happened. All of a sudden Lloyd and I decided tonight that we needed to see the first showing of the movie if we were going to get a chance to see it at all...and I ran over to the only theater doing the midnight show to get tickets. It was amazingly easy.   I'm thinking of bringing along the digital camera. Although I'm not a Potter fan...I enjoyed the books and the plots although #5 "Order of the Phoenix" could have done with some much-needed editing. I'm not dressing up at all, the only time I've really done any kind of costuming at movie theaters it was for the Lord of the Rings movies, and it was very low-key; I wore my renaissance shirt and a vest and had my long-stemmed pipe in my purse. I'm sure others will show up in costume, though, which is why the camera.  Speaking of such...maybe I'm an odd person, but sometimes I like to go to these events just to watch people. I even went to the release party for "Order of the Phoenix" at the local chain bookstore just to see what all people did. It was a lot of fun sitting around, chatting with others, and browsing through books and movies and CDs. I still haven't gotten around to making Butterbeer...the folks at the store were kind enough to give me the recipie...granted, I'd have to go out and buy vanilla flavoring first.  Well, I need to get going...I don't know when the line is going to start forming, but I'm sure it's going to be early. I doubt even if Lloyd and I show up at 9 p.m. that we'll be the first few people in line...then again, I could be very wrong.  We shall see...

						    urlLink    "Girl" by Farschian&nbsp; urlLink      Gasoline Price today $1.81  Not too much of an exciting day. Got up in time to take my sister and my almost 4-year-old nephew for a 10:30 a.m. meeting about where he was going to be going to school.   A year ago last January, my nephew, Brendon, was diagnosed as being severely hearing- impared in the right ear, and completely deaf in the left. We had been noticing early on that he wasn’t responding to noises like a normal child does, and after we ran some home tests over Christmas, we knew something was wrong. Add to that, the local Parents as Teachers program person had also noticed as well. So, this past December a cochlear device was implanted into his left ear.  A cochlear implant is a relatively simple device...well, relatively, as well as a small one. The device itself is installed under the skin of the scalp just up and behind the ear. A microfine wire from the device is run into the cochlea and therefor sends sound vibrations to the ear. To make the whole thing work is an electronic processor, which is worn in a fanny-pack, and has a wire with a magnet on it to connect it to the device (note: hair still grows in the place where the device is) and thereby activate it. The processor is programmed about once a month to turn up the volume level that Brendon can hear so that he’s not overwhelmed with sound all at once, and his neural pathways can be built in his brain to handle his hearing.  Oh, and to say the least, Brendon’s deafness hasn’t affected his personality to say the least! He’s a vivacious boy with curly blonde hair and the most expressive a person can be both with is face and with his body. He loves to goof around and flirt as well. He knows he’s cute and boy does he use it to the fullest extent...especially when he knows he’s in trouble with me or his mother. It’s so hard not to laugh when he does it, too. He just gets these riotously cute or goofy expressions on his face, and it’s obvious that he’s deliberately trying to get us to laugh, and himself out of trouble. Getting the implant has only made his personality jump five-fold. I keep telling my sister and her husband that we need to watch him when he gets into his teens, I have a feeling he’s going to be a heartbreaker or an actor. I mean really, watching “A Knight’s Tale,” he gives me the impression of looking like a four-year-old version of Heath Ledger, or even Heath Ledger’s character. Heck, I’ve even gone so far as to keep him in mind when I’m thinking of one of my characters in the “Tanwin” series...Carver ap Hugh...although I can’t say that I’ve ever written about Carver when he was four (only at 10 and 18 thus far), I can easily see him being a bit like Brendon...but as an only child.   Brendon has an older sister, Meghan, who is just about five and a half now, and she’s a personality unto herself. She’s a drama queen and we wonder if bits of her aren’t hopping ahead into teenage-hood with all the dramatics and fits she throws. It’s almost as if she’s trying on emotions, blowing them way out of proportion to see how they work, and driving us all nuts in the process because we’re trying to figure out what’s going on.  The great thing about all this is...well, for starters both Lloyd and myself are sort of getting a training course in how to take care of kids, and seeing how the other gets on with children. Needless to say, Lloyd has no problem at all, Meghan and Brendon love playing with him, and he’s definitely a kid at heart...although the body is having fits trying to keep up at times. Add to that, they’re my sister and her husband’s children, so when our nerves are close to being shot for all the attitude my niece gives us when she’s tired, cranky, and just wants her way (“Are we going to the grocery store?” “Yes Meghan, we’re going to Aldi’s.” “Aldi’s isn’t a grocery store!” “Yes it is, Meghan.”). Add to that, she’s gotten into her head that every time I take my sister somewhere then we also must go to McDonalds...or at least she subjugates us with the question “Are we going to McDonalds?” constantly. She’s got this thing about willful, stubborn, persistence. She has her view of the world and that’s that.  Tomorrow morning I get to climb out of bed to take my sister to the OB-GYN for her ultrasound. Yep, there’s a third child on the way, although it’s doing a great job of giving her aunt (me) the fits, or at least the worries. My sister has spotted early on in the pregnancy, but the doctor checked her out repeatedly, kept an eye on her, and said all was well. Then last week my sister mentions that she hasn’t felt the baby kick yet. I probably turned white as a ghost while she just looked at me and said, “What?” My sister is Mrs. Pregnant-Mother-Knowledge-Woman. Although she hasn’t gone to medical school, she seems to know the stuff like the back of her hand, and what she doesn’t know she talks to her doctor about; thankfully she doesn’t take chances. Then there’s me, who is more fearful than normal folks about her loosing the child. Granted, she’s never miscarried before, and the baby’s heartbeat has been found...I just have vague memories of my mother’s miscarriages and the one baby girl that was still-born when I was five; it wasn’t until I was in my mid-teens that it got explained to me why my mother hadn’t come home from the hospital with a baby back then. Note: my sister is just shy of eight years younger than I am. Anyhow, something I’ve come to realize is that part of me is very much tied in with my niece and nephew and my sister, and that a still-birth or a miscarriage effects more than just the mother and father...it effects the whole family. That, and I’m not sure if I’ll ever have children. I’m hoping that I do, but I’m not sure when it’ll happen or if it will happen.   So, that’s the day in a nutshell. Meanwhile, my future mother-in-law, I guess I’ll dub her Mom Sung-cha (her nickname is Sandy, but I like her Korean birth name better) since I call her “mom” anyhow...she’s pretty much adopted me, although she’s not giving me chores...yet. As I was saying, though, she’s working on going to visit her daughter, Chris, down in Nashville. Lloyd’s younger brother, Court, used to work for an commercial airline and part of his package for leaving was that he got tickets for a year. The catch is, those tickets are only valid if there’s a seat available. If not, then the ticket gets bumped to the next flight out. She’s hoping to go Thursday morning and be back Saturday morning, but who knows. Admittedly, I’m up for some private time with Lloyd when Court’s out of the house. I just have a mental lock on getting all lovey-dovey when someone else is in the house. I don’t know, I just get embarrassed at the thought that someone will hear me, and worse it being a relation that will then perhaps tease me or just give me funny looks. I’m self-conscious in that manner.  Meanwhile, I have a gaming convention to prepare for  urlLink Die Con 4   only I now have to e-mail the head of the con that I won’t be able to make it for the Friday 2 p.m. game I was scheduled to run because I need to run my sister and nephew to his speech therapist. I also have to e-mail my friend Mike to tell him I won’t be able to make the game this Sunday because I’d already scheduled to run a game for Die Con that day.  You know, for being off from school I’m awfully busy. It’s almost as if folks, namely my family, have been waiting for me to get out of classes so that I can do stuff for them.  My life is not boring!

						    urlLink    Skitter-Boo agreeing that 5:30 a.m. is just too early to be getting up.&nbsp; urlLink     So much for sleeping in on a holiday, I got up at 5:30 a.m. this morning to help my beloved Lloyd build shelves in the garage. I should have gotten up later. Already it's afternoon and I'm finally feeling awake even after a 32 oz. Rooster Booster Lite (taurine, guanine, but no caffine) at 9 a.m.. Now that I'm hearing the footsteps of my possible future mother-in-law upstairs, I think perhaps it's time I go wake someone up from his brief nap so we can get back to work. I want to get the organization of the garage done and his room cleaned out before my sanity breaks or I go batty hearing his mother complain just one more time.

						    urlLink    Vardzia Medieval Cave Monastery, Georgia&nbsp; urlLink     A year ago today my grandfather was laying in a hospital bed in his room in his own home with an oxygen tank helping him to breathe. It was a rough Memorial Day for me then, living with him and my mother to make sure he was cared for. He was dying, and on June 8th he passed away shortly before 10 p.m. I must say that I miss him, and my grandmother too; she had passed away from cancer on 5 November 1999. Until they died, I could never imagine a time when they wouldn't be around for me, when they wouldn't be alive, my grandfather watching golf and making running commentaries on the football game while poking through one of his thick tomes on history. Meanwhile, my grandmother would flit around the house like the Titanic before it sank, big and grand. My grandfather had worked as a banking executive, my grandmother as a night-club and opera singer. They both had their imperfections, things I could barely tolerate about them, but those were things that made them who they were even if my grandmother had too many shoes and a dress dripping with rhinestones.  I miss them.  My grandmother left me a legacy of showmanship, that if one was to be showy, one had to do it with style and grace. She gave me a love for the arts, although she said I could never make a living being a writer let alone an archaeologist. Oh, yes, and she also left me the legacy of her shoes. When she passed away I was the only one in the family with big enough feet to fit them. Most of them I've had to store away, beautiful as they are, they are not walking shoes, and for now I need practicality over beauty.  My grandfather left me curiosity and a love of science and learning. He was always reading: books, newspapers, magazines. He had the requisite National Geographic as well as the Smithsonian magazines, and I got raised with a healthy dose of PBS, "National Geographic" programs, and "Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom" along with my Scooby-Doo cartoons. I guess it's in part because of him that I'm very interested in languages and their origins, most notably the Indo-Europeans and Proto-Indo-Europeans.  Well, I shall see what I can do about making this day a bit more cheerful.  Guten Tag

						    urlLink    A Pompeian Garden by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema&nbsp; urlLink     I thought I would leave a taste of my writing behind before heading off to merciful sleep. Below is an exercise which actually convinced my fiction-writing professor to read the fantasy genre. Read here that she was a writer of "literature" and short stories, and her view on any kind of genre was that it was a crutch for writers, falling back on stereotypes and whatnot. So, here it is, the exercise I wrote when she asked us to write a scene in which the fantastic came across as real in the story.    “Dash it all! You wouldn’t believe how much this impedes, if not totally decimates my human-female-behavior studies! How will I ever recover! All my research, all my years of observation gone into the litter-box like so much waste! Really, I can’t believe you!”  “That’s makes two of us,” I muttered, gingerly sipping my coffee as Charlie, or should I say Charles, my cat, glared at me over the brim of my cup as he stood, ears back and whiskers sticking straight out, on top of the entertainment section of my newspaper.  My stomach rumbled and I took a bite out of my cream-cheese-laden bagel the same as I did every morning.  “You’re ignoring me, aren’t you?” Charles continued, spreading his white and gray long-haired butt out in the middle of the comic strip section as he sat on his haunches. “I can’t believe this! Years of work lost just because you decided to switch bi-pedal species, and you don’t seem to care!”  “Excuse me? Since when did I choose to switch species?” I said with a voice muffled by a mouthful of bagel and a few sharp teeth.  “Since four months ago! Or don’t you remember, you with your human-thing addled brain!”  I was being insulted by my own cat, my own 9-year-old, overweight, and until four months ago, otherwise silent cat. All right, maybe not all that silent, he was a bit of a klutz and had a tendency of knocking things over, as well as yowling at me at all hours of the day and night. But since then I’ve learned exactly how loud he can be, and exactly what he yowls now that I can understand him, and frankly I’m just about shy of not giving a damn.  “You know, with all your complaining, I should just put you out. Take you to the pound or something.”  “Then who would protect you?” Even for a cat he sounded genuinely astounded and abhorred.   “I dunno, maybe I could change my renter’s contract and get a dog.”  “A dog! Do you know how much trouble a dog can be?”  “No, but I figure you’ll tell me about it,” I muttered, taking another bite of bagel. I have to admit, I didn’t hear Charles’ response as I chewed because I was too busy admiring the neatly bitten part of the bagel.   Up until an incident four months ago my teeth hadn’t exactly been perfect. Even after having a few teeth removed and enduring years of braces as a teenager, they had had a mind of their own and decided that they wanted to be no only slightly crooked, but also coffee and cola-stained. I won’t even mention the one crown, and all the fillings. Then one day I looked in the mirror and everything was different.  “Would you stop doing that and listen to me?”  I realized Charles had caught me feeling one of my canines with my tongue, and smiled at him broadly in fun. His ears flattened back as he cowed down, eyes wide with fear.  “Would you please stop that,” he said. “You know it makes me uncomfortable.”  “Well, get off my newspaper and go eat some catfood or something. Go chase a mouse or play in the toilet.”  Charles slunk off the table and I got up to get ready for the day. Although a student out for her masters degree in history, and one with mommy and daddy footing the whole bill, including room and board, I still liked to keep my sanity by working part time even if it was helping out in a restaurant. Even as I pulled on my worn jeans and my newly tie-died  and very oversized t-shirt with Korean lettering on it, the thought of spicy kimchee and chocolate Pocky biscuits filled my brain.   “Do you even know what your t-shirt says?” Charlie muttered, hopping onto the toilet seat as I brushed my teeth vigorously over the sink in the bathroom.  I shook my head as I rinsed my mouth out with mouthwash.  Charles was silent.  Looking into the mirror, I ignored him again as I admired my clean, white, perfectly straight teeth, pulling my lips back to see my unnaturally elongated and pointy upper and lower canines. Sure, it was strange, but I wasn’t about to complain, much.  “You think I’m a succubus or something?” I asked aloud.  “Succubus? More like a suck-you-train the way you went after that last male you had here. Lest I remind you that he wasn’t human?”  “Lest you not remind me that I didn’t know it until it was too late,” I said, attempting to talk and apply lipgloss at the same time.  “Too late for who, you or him?”  “Look, how was I supposed to know he was a vampire? It’s not as if these guys are supposed to be real or anything.”  If a cat could shrug, Charlie actually pulled it off. “I thought after dating him for six months you might have noticed. Especially the part about him never eating around you, although he’d take you out to dinner, and the part about him never being around during the day.”  I pursed my lips, and strode out to continue getting ready, Charles catting my every step.   “Look, I understand you hadn’t had sex in years.”  I picked up my purse, rummaging through it for loose change and the occasional dollar bill. I made a mental note to stop by the bank, only to hear Charlie still going.  “I just don’t think vampires were built for that. He looked quite surprised! Quite surprised indeed! After all the legends one would think that they had all kinds of strength. That one practically crawled out of your apartment. I think you did him in or just about!”  I stared at my cat. Until the whole escapade I had never considered what a cat thought, especially about sex, nor had I even considered them watching me, let alone studying me.  “I’m just hoping to meet with an associate of mine who’s visiting in the area to compare notes with, maybe find some new leads. Have you seen Michael lately?”  “No,” I lied. After all the voice-mails (how did he know when I was out) apologizing for this, that, or the other reason for not meeting me on dates, I was not going to add to my embarrassment. The last time I had seen my so-called boyfriend cum vampire had been two nights before at nightclub a friend of mine had coaxed me into for a whole ten minutes. Maybe it was all the noise. Maybe it was seeing Michael literally scrambling to get across the dance floor and out the back door when he saw me. What really got me though was how more than just a few people seemed to be stylishly backing away from me with the look of fear in their eyes. Fear, in what was supposed to be the “in” crowd! As if everything that had happened already hadn’t clearly told me I was different.  “Well, at least we know you’re not a vampire.”  I nodded at this, pulling out enough change to buy some gum with at the corner store. “Yeah, no longing for drinking blood, no fearing garlic. I can even see myself in the mirror, and go out in the daylight.”  “But then there’s that ability to fly.”  “And talk to cats,” I grumbled. So much for trying to pretend I was normal. “So, my little furry Einstein, what am I then?”  Charlie looked up at me with large blue eyes and a worried look on his puss. “I don’t know.”

						    urlLink    Ithaca&nbsp; urlLink     Ithaca  When you set out on your journey to Ithaca,  pray that the road is long, full of adventure, full of knowledge. The Lestrygonians and the Cyclops, the angry Poseidon -- do not fear them: You will never find such as these on your path, if your thought remain lofty, if a fine emotion touches y our spirit adn your body. The Lestrygonians and the Cyclops, the fierce Poseidon you will never encounter, if you do not carry them within your soul, if your soul does not set them up before you.  Pray that the road is long. That the summer mornings are many, when, with such pleasure, with such joy you will encounter ports seen for the first time; stop at Phoenician markets,  and purchase fine merchandise, mother-of-pearl and coral, amber and ebony, and sensual perfumes of all kinds, as many sensual perfumes as you can; visit many Egyptian cities, to learn and learn from scholars.  Always keep Ithaca in your mind. To arrive there is your ultimate goal. But do not hurry the voyage at all. It is better to let it last for many years; and to anchor at the island when you are old,  rich with all you have gained on the way, not expecting that Ithaca will offer you riches.  Ithaca has given you a beautiful voyage. Without her you would have never set out on the road. She has nothing more to give you.  And if you find her poor, Ithaca has not deceived you. Wise as you have become, with so much experience, you must already have understood what Ithacas mean  - Constantine P. Cavafy (1911)  The above poem was given to me at the end of the autumn term by my Greek Archaeology professor, Dr. Michael Cosmopoulos. Referring to the journey home of Odysseus in Homer's poem "The Odyssey," I find it quite fitting to this time in my life, as well as the view I hold of my future...a string of adventures and discoveries making for a life-long journey that ends in my own "Ithaca." For as it is said, it is not the destination that makes for an interesting trip, it is the journey itself.  And so this pale representation of my life comes to pages, poorly written I think, at least in comparison to the tales and lays of old, but hopefully understandable.  A long journey begins with one step at a time.

						   Beginning note:  Although I will still be posting here, there is now a sister diary over at http://ghost_horse_woman.blogspot.com where I will be posting pictures as well as diary entries. In short, that site will be the illustrated version of this one as that they have free picture hosting.  It’s been a busy week to say the least, but isn’t it always when looking back, and as that I have not been keeping this updated daily as I would have liked, it’s going to be a long entry.   HARRY POTTER: THURSDAY  4 JUNE Last Thursday was of course the midnight showing of “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.” Through fortune, and Lloyd mowing the lawn, we got the chance to go to the show, and I was rather...well, surprised. For starters, only one theater in St. Louis was doing a midnight show, and amazingly enough it was very easy to get tickets even at three in the afternoon. Admittedly, with the popularity of Potter, I had expected something on the level of “Star Wars Episode I”-style attendance making both for sold out tickets as well as a lot of people in costume and long lines. I was wrong on all three counts.   Showing up at 9:30 p.m. Thursday night, I had expected to find a long line, or at least a sizable one, but found instead only three people there for the movie, and all of them were sitting at the little tables in the cafe area of the theater. To say the least, I was beginning to wonder if I wasn’t coming off as a fan-girl type of person; I mean I enjoy the Harry Potter books, but I’m not up for doing costumes and whatnot, though I do find it neat to see young people all wrapped up in it all. About 9:40 a gaggle of young ladies came in dressed to the nines in Hogwarts uniforms armed with both wands and the English school robes that usually are only seen (and cheaply so) at graduations in the states. Hoping that folks would show up in costume, and wanting to share the event later with my friends (costuming is a real bear sometimes, and I laud folks for taking up the effort both for their enjoyment as well as others’), I had trundled along the digital camera that my sister and her husband had given me for Christmas (given to me along with an order that when I go to Ireland for school that I take LOTS of pictures). I almost fell over with the vocal shout of enthusiasm when I asked the young ladies (very lively teenagers! I only wished I had a portion of their energy) if I could take their picture. So...for those of you on my “Illustrated Diary,” you can see the picture below, though it still needs fixing.  Oh, yes, and I need to make a note here that I stopped by the local YMCA and picked up an application. Wednesday I had seen that they had a help wanted sign out, called, and found out that they had a front desk position open part time.  urlLink    Hogwarts Students&nbsp; urlLink     FRIDAY 5 JUNE As per every Friday, I took  my nephew along with my sister and my niece to have Brendan (found out it’s spelled with an “a”) meet with his speech therapist. Beforehand I had to drop Lloyd off for job training over at the community college where, while going to school, he’ll be maintaining their computers. So, for an hour it was myself and Meghan, and I actually found something that she enjoys doing. Usually I bring a huge box of crayons (the advantage of being older...no one can say “no” when you want the bizillion different colored crayons out there) and a pad of paper, but this time I brought the makeup and manicure bag (this coming from a rather plain woman). So, for an hour I did her fingernails and put a little makeup on here including glitter to make her look like a little princess. Oh she loved it! :-) I got a picture of it, but as that I’m still learning the oddities of my camera, the glitter didn’t show up all that well.  I also received my financial aid award letter, also known as how much I can accept for student loans. Aside from it being more than I got last year, I also don’t have to worry about paying for student housing in the dorms, so I’ve got a little something extra to pay other bills with.   urlLink    Brendon&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Meghan Dressed Up&nbsp; urlLink      SATURDAY: 5 JUNE This and Sunday were kind of rough days for me as that I had promised to run five role-playing games at the Die Con gaming convention and I could not make it, and it was just eating me alive not to be there. There was a problem with my car (to say the least!), and had I been thinking straight I might have gotten a lift from someone, but even off the top of my head now I can’t  even  think of anyone who would have been available to take me.   Well, Lloyd’s mom was talking about getting me a cell phone, maybe it’s about time, as well as getting contact numbers for the folks I’ll be running games for.  Sadly, we got word on Saturday that one of the long-time members of the church I attend (when I have the time, although Mom Sungcha aka Lloyd’s mom, goes every week) passed away while she was in the hospital. We were told of the funeral and memorial arrangements, and asked if we could help out since she really didn’t have a very large family.  As if to add to this, although the day started with CNN Headline News saying that Ronald Reagan was very ill and it was thought that he would pass away in a few months, later in the day it was announced that he had just died.  Let me start by saying that at almost 34, I was old enough to experience and remember the Reagan years in the White House, and although I didn’t hold with everything he did and didn’t do, I do have a portion of respect for the man. I also have a healthy respect for the relationship he and Nancy had, and how hard it must have been both physically and emotionally to take care of him over the later years with his struggle with Parkinson’s disease. It comes across very clearly that president or not, she very much loved the man.  Anyhow, with all this looking at my own past, my own personal history, it’s made me even more aware of the memories I carry. I remember being on a school-sponsored spring-break trip to Washington D.C. when the “line in the sand” thing was going on with Muammar Al Qadhafi of Libya and how close the U.S. battleships could sail to Libya (this after it was found that the people who had blown up a West Berlin nightclub and killed U.S. service-people were linked to Libya). Makes me wonder how many people remember the invasion of Panama and the ouster of  President Manuel Noriega on December 17, 1989, Noriega when the elder George Bush took over from Reagan. Then of course, there was the Iran-Contra scandal with Oliver North in the mid-80’s. Before the fall of the Berlin wall, and that blessed soul Mikhail Gorbechev who headed the former Soviet Union, I remember how terrified I was that some idiot somewhere would become mentally unhinged and launch a nuclear warhead and start a war.  http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/rr40.html http://www.qadhafi.org/  Speaking of old memories. A couple of weeks ago I stopped by my storage locker and picked up a pair of old cowboy boots I had. One of the first things out of my mouth was a thanks to my dead grandmother for having them cleaned, because they are now about 22-years-old. Yep, my boots are older than some of my friends, and here’s the kicker, they still fit! My old boots that I had gotten before I went to horse-back riding camp at the YMCA camp, had worn to a wonderful looseness, soaked repeatedly in creeks (it’s like air conditioning for the feet) and walked in for I don’t know how many miles...boots that I used to wear around our family farm.... it was suddenly like meeting my 12-year-old self, and all sorts of memories I hadn’t thought of in so long came pouring back in a good way. Things like being up in the barn loft and sitting on the hay and writing while reading “The Neverending Story” by Michael Ende, ice skating on the pond in winter, seeing the full moon go down outside my window in summer, the sound of the frogs around teh pond, catching tadpoles every year, it just goes on.  Oh, yeah, and thanks to me being home on Saturday, I also got a call from my mother. Admittedly, I was left wondering if she was calling me to make arrangements for both Lloyd and I to come out and help her move something, but that wasn’t the case.  Apparently my mother has found proof that what has been told to my grandfather’s side of the family (my mother’s father) has been true...we are indeed descended from royalty. Now let me add this caveat here and say that we’ve never thought that we belonged to the house of Stuart or even the house of Windsor let alone the house of Hannover. It’s just that we knew somewhere in the German lineage there was talk of nobility, and my mother found the who, the what, and the wear.  To sum up, I am apparently a princess of the house of Ruess. Between 1200 and 1300 A.D. one of the first Heirich’s in the family (named after the Holy Roman Emperor Henry who had given the title of duke and then prince to the family) went to Russia and not only found a wife, but fell in love with the land. When he returned, he took on the new name of Ruess, which means “Russian” in the German of the period. Now the area of the principality of the house of Ruess was sort of medium, pushed up near Czechoslovakia, only with the fights with Saxony to the west, it got shrunk down even smaller to the point that after the Ruess line split into two halves (in 1564), the Elder and the Younger, that as of 1919 it was the two smallest principalities in what was to become Germany. Gera was the capital for the younger line of Ruess, and is in an area called “Thuringia” in Germany, not far away is Greiz, the capital of the older line. Sadly, Gera was largely destroyed in 1945 by allied bombings. Anyhow, Franz Ruess, a member of the elder line, came over to the U.S. in the 1830’s and founded my family. Needless to say, my niece, Meghan fits the bill of “princess” perfectly, although we’ve dubbed her “drama princess.”   SUNDAY: 6 JUNE Aside from lamenting the fact that I felt like I had let down the folks at Die Con (purely my feeling, and not the head of the convention or anyone else saying anything...I even sent an apology letter along with an explanation of my absence), I have no idea what I did on Sunday. And yes, I do take what I promise to do seriously, and that includes running a game.   MONDAY: 7 JUNE Ran over to campus to drop off my financial aid award letter and found out that the disbursal of the funds won’t happen until a week before school starts. The bad news is, I still owe the cashier’s office a little less than $100 for health stuff, and a couple of things I needed to pick up at the book store.  I also went and picked up the books I’d requested on archaeology and language, and...well...I think I’ve found my niche: Archaeological Linguistics. And yes, it’s indeed a real field, and apparently a very active one. The thing is, though, not only do I need to have German (for current research), Latin (for older works) and Ancient Greek, but I also need French (for current theories) before moving on to graduate school. Hmm...I wonder if I ever mentioned that I want to learn Korean and Russian as well along with Irish Gaelic, Welsh, and Old English? :-)   I also stopped by the YMCA and dropped off my application for employment with hopes that maybe I’d fit.    TUESDAY: 8 JUNE Well, I had written up a long entry on this day for the diary, but my computer locked up and I lost it (which is why I’m writing this on Word before posting it to the net). It was a year ago that day that my grandfather had passed away, and although I missed him, and my grandmother, I didn’t feel super-sad or weepy. I did take care of myself, and kept active by helping Lloyd work on the shelves for the storage garage out back; it’s turning out to be a really complex-ish task, not to mention a very warm one with this latest weather.   urlLink    Lloyd&nbsp; urlLink        WEDNESDAY: 9 JUNE Found out that there’s a book called 501 Latin Verbs. YES!!! All the verbs are put through their tenses and declensions, and when I have the funds, I’m getting the thing, along with a copy of the book we’re going to be using for Ancient Greek at school. I have to admit, after looking at a sample page, I’m a little nervous of the Greek...it’s a whole new alphabet that I’m going to have to learn, but at least the professor and I know each other so I should have help.  After running to get lunch for my sister and the kids, she was stuck at home, there was a phone call on the answering machine from Lisa at the YMCA, she wanted to get me in for an interview. I of course gave her a call back and had a delightful conversation with her, and we set up the appointment for Thursday at 2 p.m. for me to come in which worked perfectly.   THURSDAY: 10 JUNE The morning started out a little earlier than usual. Mrs. Arbogast’s funeral service at the church was at 9 a.m., and we where there to help out as well as be of support. After not being at church for almost six months and then some because of school, the bishop and the others were glad to see me back, and said as much very clearly, and teased me about being gone. I also found out that aside from being a practicing lawyer (yes, the clergy of my church have regular jobs to make ends meet), I found out the bishop is also a linguist. Needless to say, when he has the time, I’m going to have to talk more with him, also I do enjoy the fact that he doesn’t just go through the motions of a service and then give a sermon, he actually literally sits down and tells us the history of what is done during the service and whatnot. So, yes, as a history-type of person, you can see why he sort of appeals to me as a person, although the poor gentleman always seems so hurried.  Lunch at Denny’s with Mom Sungcha, Lloyd, and Sister Jane (cool lady), followed by a brief time at home to change and check mail before hurrying off to my interview.  Well, the interview went rather well. The interview itself lasted an hour, and at the end of it Lisa and Nick (who will be my two supervisors) offered me the job at the YMCA. So, not only do I get to work a part-time job where they’re very willing to work around my schedule (Nick’s going to college as well), but I also get a membership to the Y, and health and dental insurance as well as life insurance! The folks there too are great, I mean I’m really impressed with them. The work environment is comfortable, relaxed, and supportive. The thing Nick and Lisa stressed to me was that the Y is a non-for-profit organization, that they’re there to provide a safe and healthy place for the community as well as support. Did I mention the place is huge? I mean this is the perfect job for me right now. It gives me a break from studying, makes me socialize, lets me share something I enjoy (the Y is just that kind of place where it encourages getting exercise and playing), and I get a paycheck. Add to that, it’s a job that will make me healthier!  You know, I was a bit concerned about my weight. I mean sometimes I just don’t like the way some cloths look on me, and frankly I’ve avoided shorts for years. So, I’ll be in a place where I can get exercise as well as education on how to do so. I still have to giggle that Mom Sungcha had me go grocery shopping yesterday. I’ve been concerned about being sure I have fruits and vegetables that that’s the majority of food in the refrigerator: corn, strawberries, grapefruit, watermelon, carrots, salad, and golden delicious apples.   Speaking of which...I need to go get something to eat. :-)   urlLink    Brendan teaching Lloyd how to play the piano&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    The Little Princess&nbsp; urlLink

						   Warning about new virus   If you receive an email entitled "Bedtimes" delete it IMMEDIATELY. Do not open it. Apparently this one is pretty nasty. It will not only erase everything on your hard drive, but it will also delete anything on disks within 20 feet of your computer. It demagnetizes the strips on ALL of your credit cards. It reprograms your ATM access code, screws up the tracking on your VCR, and uses subspace field harmonics to scratch any CD's you attempt to play. It will program your phone auto dial to call only 0898 numbers. This virus will mix antifreeze into your fish tank.    IT WILL CAUSE YOUR TOILET TO FLUSH WHILE YOU ARE SHOWERING. It will drink ALL your beer. FOR GOD'S SAKE, ARE YOU LISTENING?? It will leave dirty underwear on the coffee table when you are expecting company. It will replace your shampoo with Nair and your Nair with Rogaine. If the "Bedtimes" message opened in a Windows 95/98 environment, it will leave the toilet seat up and leave your hair dryer plugged in dangerously close to a full bathtub. It will not only remove the forbidden tags from your mattresses and pillows, it will also refill your skim milk with whole milk.      *** WARN AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN. ***   And if you don't send this to 5000 people in 20 seconds, you'll fart so hard that your right leg will spasm and shoot straight out in front of you, sending sparks that will ignite the person nearest you.

						   Warning to Men  Police are warning all men who frequent clubs, parties and local pubs to be alert and stay cautious when offered a drink by any woman.  A date-rape drug on the market called "Beer" is used by many females to target unsuspecting men.  The drug is generally found in liquid form and is now available almost anywhere. It comes in bottles, cans, from taps and in large "kegs."    Beer is used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to persuade their male victims to go home with them and have sex.  Statistically, a woman needs only to persuade a guy to consume a few units of Beer and then simply ask him home for no strings attached sex.  Men are rendered helpless against this approach. After several Beers, men have reportedly succumbed to perform sexual acts on horrific looking women to whom they would never normally be attracted.  After drinking Beer men often awaken with only hazy memories of exactly what happened to them the night before, often with just a vague feeling that "something bad" occurred.  At other times these unfortunate men are swindled out of their life's savings, in a familiar scam known as "a relationship."  It has been reported that in extreme cases, the female may even be shrewd enough to entrap the unsuspecting male into a longer-term form of servitude and punishment referred to as "marriage."    Apparently, men are much more susceptible to this scam after Beer is administered and sex is offered by the predatory females.   Forward this warning to every male you know.  If you fall victim to this insidious Beer and the predatory women administering it, there are male support groups with venues in every town where you can discuss the details of your shocking encounter in an open and frank manner with similarly affected, like-minded guys.  For the support group nearest you, just look up  "Golf Courses" in the Yellow Pages.

						   Once upon a time, long, long ago there was a presidential election that was too close to call.  Neither the Republican presidential candidate nor the Democratic presidential candidate had enough votes to win the election. Therefore, it was decided that there should be an ice-fishing contest between the two candidates to determine the final winner. There was much talk about ballot recounting, court challenges, etc., but a week-long ice fishing competition seemed the (manly) way to settle things. The candidate that catches the most fish at the end of the week wins.  After a lot of back and forth discussion, it was decided that the contest would take place on a remote and frozen lake in Minnesota.  There were to be no observers present, and both men were to be sent out separately on this remote lake and return daily with their catch for counting and verification!   At the end of the first day, George W. returns to the starting line and he has 10 fishes.  Soon, Kerry returns and has zero fish.  Well, everyone assumes he is just having another bad hair day or something and hopefully, he will catch up the next day.  At the end of the 2nd day George W. comes in with 20 fishes and Kerry comes in again with none.  That evening, Bill Clinton gets together secretly with Kerry and says, "I think George W. is a lowlife cheatin' son-of-a-gun. I want you to go out tomorrow and don't even bother with fishing.  Just spy on him and see if he is cheating in any way.  The next night (after George W. comes back with 50 fish), Clinton says to Kerry, "Well, what about it, is George W. cheatin'?"  "He sure is, Bill, he's cutting holes in the ice!"

						    urlLink    Black Wolf or Black Dog?&nbsp; urlLink     It's an early Saturday morning this morning, up at 5:30 a.m. so that I can be sure to get to work at 7. I got the job up at the YMCA working at the front desk, and as part of my training, I must go through the CPR and First Aid program. So, after 3 p.m. today I will be Red Cross Certified and be prepared to be a first-responder in case someone takes ill or has a heart attack at the Y.  To sum up the past week: I've registered for classes over at the university, so it's now official...I will be taking Latin, Ancient Greek, and German II this autumn. I'm debating whether or no to go to National Irish University in Galway for a semester come spring on the grounds that I'm not sure if they offer Ancient Greek or Latin, and as that at my university it's the same professor for both...even if they do, it's going to be a challange trying to get her to accept the transfer of hours. That, and there's the issue as to how both classes are only offered once in autumn, with the follow-up class only being offered in spring.  Meanwhile, I listen to the BBC World Radio broadcast and wonder what it is that the Irish protesters are saying specifically, wishing I could get a listen. President Bush is meeting with the European Union heads at a castle in the west of Ireland, and with a quarter of the Irish police and 700+ security people from the US, the protesters aren't getting anywhere near the castle to be heard. Frankly, I'm of the opinion that they have the right to protest, especially against the U.S. on the grounds of the lunacy that is called our "foreign policy." The U.S.S.R. collapses, and now, a little over a dozen years later, the U.S. is becoming the big world bully.  And what about the U.S. soldiers slaving, er, serving in Iraq? Dare I ask how many of them don't have appropriate weapons let alone bullet-resistant vests (nothing's entirely bullet-proof). Although it's rumors I've heard, rumors are powerful things, especially when there's a seed of truth to them. It's bad enough that not only is the U.S. military forcing individual troopers to stay, reinstating their tour of duty eventhough their time has run out, they're also now pulling back in those who had just left. It makes me wonder when the retired soldery will be getting phone calls asking for them to join again. Desperation and lunacy, all by men who consider themselves in control, think they have power, and yet what they don't realize when they step into their suits in the morning is this...power is an illusory thing, and it can be taken away or disappear with a puff of wind. People only have power when it is given to them by others. The president is only the president only because it is agreed to by the population of the U.S.. The executive and judicial branches of our government only have their powers because it is given to them and agreed upon by the populace. What would happen if the populace en mass decided to nix all of that? Change their minds and pull the power plug? The heads would think that there would be chaos in the nation, but there wouldn't.  Needless to say, you can tell my perspective on the Iraq "war." I could have done a better job. :-)

						   I went over to what once was my grandparents’ house today to help my mother pack things up for the big move on the 12th of this month, and was immediately given the odious chore of packing up the stuff on my grandfather’s work-bench in the basement. Actually, it wasn’t that bad, there was just a lot of stuff to pack. On the other hand, though, my mother told me that I could go through the boxes on the shelves against one of the walls and sort out what I wanted to keep.  This was a good thing.  This was a very good thing.  Apparently both my mother and my aunt haven’t been entirely on top of things, then again my grandparents had a lot of things they’ve gotten over the years to sort through, and being the inquisitive person that I am (i.e. a professional snoop/researcher since I was four) I made a number of finds they missed.  The first was a black faux fur coat that had been stuffed away. It looks like a cross between a wrinkled velvet blanket and a teddy-bear skin gone wrong but I liked it, must be my grandmother’s side of me poking up.  Come to think of it, if I was leaning that way in my thoughts, I would have said that the spirits of my grandmother and grandfather were guiding me in a way, or at least bludgeoning me because I’m the only one in the family who apparently pays attention in a half-assed sort of way.  You see, aside from the coat, I also found five boxes of L.P.s (yep, good old vinyl) of all kinds of music, although most were of a classical or operatic nature...which means they had to have been my grandmother’s.  Add to that, I found three boxes of sheet music and old books on music, and I do mean old! There are more than a few that will need to be re-bound, and one of them had the date of 1909.  The above two things were important because music was very important to my grandmother. For most of her life she had been taking singing lessons and was very, very active in the music community here in St. Louis. Both an opera and a night club singer, she was one of the hands that built an opera company here in the city, as well as for a time had a night club called "The Lorelei” in Gaslight Square (a very ritzy, night-club area of town in the 50’s and 60’s).   To say she was a character would be like saying that a diamond was just shiny. She was a big woman, both in height and personality, a real grande dam. Among her possessions was a navy blue dress studded with a wide swath of rhine-stones around the collar and cuffs. I won’t tell you how many shoes she had specifically because I’ve never bothered to count, but she loved shoes, and being the only member of my family with big enough feet to fill them, what my aunt didn’t take for her remembrance, I inherited, and there were a lot! And all in their own labeled shoe-boxes.  As for personality, I can sum up my grandmother into two small anecdotes. The first I learned of shortly before she died...that when she and my grandfather owned “The Lorelei” not only did she sing, but her last song for the night would be “Let Me Entertain You.” This would have been no big thing except for the fact that as she was singing she would pull the falsies out of her dress and throw them into the audience. Note for those of you too young to know what “falsies” are and those too old to remember...to sum up they were the old-timey version of the wonder-bra, only instead of it being a bra, it was just two pads that you stuck into your bra to lift, create cleavage, and make the breasts look a bit bigger.  The second of these small anecdotes: the morning my grandmother died from her long fight with metastasized melanoma, barely able to speak clearly because of the second tumor in her brain, she sang “Let Me Entertain You” with all the energy she could. Grasping the arms of the hospital bed we had put in her room at home (she had wanted to die in her home with my grandfather), she shook the bed while belting out the song as best she could and laughed when she was done. On the 5th of November 1999, shortly after 10 p.m. she passed away.  My aunt, the eldest of the two daughters my grandparents had, and the only two children they had, practically beatified my grandmother into sainthood when she passed, or so it seemed. Seeing it from my perspective, and with what I know, although my mother thinks my aunt is off of her rocker, I can understand where my aunt is coming from to some degree, and that it’s part of her grieving process. Note: after my grandfather’s death, my mother and my aunt finally came to terms with the blatant truth that while my aunt is the emotional one, my mother is the logical one...and both of them can take it to extremes.   What can I say, my aunt and my mother are human...and then I can laugh, because I know I’m human too, and have my own quirks.  The big find of the day though came when I found a box marked “souvenirs & letters.” Opening it up, I found a hard-cover, leather bound notebook/binder with “Students Note Book” embossed on the cover sitting on the top. The first lined page was dated 28 November 1934, and as that the rest of the notebook had all the hallmarks of a Roman Catholic school education, I assumed it to have once belonged to my grandmother, and as that she was born in 1923, that at the time of writing this, she would have been 11 years old.  If that had not been enough, right below it was a manila folder marked AG-201—Klatz, Harold D. (Civ), and within the folder were letters my grandfather had written to her while he was serving in World War II, and interspersed with them are letters she had written him and other odds and ends from what looks to be May 1943 through September 1943. I still have to sort through them, and as I do, I’m typing them into the computer with the full intents of making them available on the internet as well on the grounds that even if my computer goes belly-up, I will still have access to them. Not to mention, maybe someone else will find them interesting as well.  I have to admit that when I first found the letters and rifled through them, I came across a hand-written “Notice of Divorce” with another line right below it which read something like “so we can get married again, and again, and again.” Beneath the introductory phrase was a kind of running list of what my grandfather apparently liked about my grandmother, and I couldn’t help but bust out laughing. One line read “built like a brick shithouse in a strong wind” which is very much the way I view the youthful version of my grandfather’s wild sense of humor. Not long after that I was in tears, sad because I miss both of my grandparents (my grandfather died in June of 2003), and sad because their house had been sold...a kind of physical reminder of their existence. I’m still kind of grieving, which is fine, it’s a part of life and I can contend with it...so long as I find something besides my shirt to blow my nose on.  Lloyd’s comment upon seeing the box once we got it home was “You could be going through this for the rest of your life.” We found neat clippings of news articles, camp newspapers, and comics in just the second bundle of letters wrapped in a “Victory Pack.”  Well, it’s already getting late, so off to bed I go.   Needless to say, I’ve had a couple of great inheritance’s plopped into my proverbial lap. A real find for a history and archaeology junky like myself. :-)

						    urlLink    Research funded by NASA and the National Science Foundation has led to evidence of an impact crater believed to be associated with the "Great Dying," the largest extinction event in the history of life on Earth.  Scientist Luann Becker and her team found extensive evidence of a 125-mile-wide crater, called Bedout, off the northwestern coast of Australia.

(Phone: 703/292-7734)  Gail Gallessich University of California, Santa Barbara (Phone: 805/893-7220)   May 13, 2004 RELEASE : 04-159  Evidence Of Meteor Impact Found Off Australian Coast  An impact crater believed to be associated with the "Great Dying," the largest extinction event in the history of life on Earth, appears to be buried off the coast of Australia.  NASA and the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the major research project headed by Luann Becker, a scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Science Express, the electronic publication of the journal Science, published a paper describing the crater today.  Most scientists agree a meteor impact, called Chicxulub, in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, accompanied the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. But until now, the time of the Great Dying 250 million years ago, when 90 percent of marine and 80 percent of land life perished, lacked evidence and a location for a similar impact event.  Becker and her team found extensive evidence of a 125-mile-wide crater, called Bedout, off the northwestern coast of Australia. They found clues matched up with the Great Dying, the period known as the end-Permian. This was the time period when the Earth was configured as one primary land mass called Pangea and a super ocean called Panthalassa.  During recent research in Antarctica, Becker and her team found meteoric fragments in a thin claystone "breccia" layer, pointing to an end-Permian event. The breccia contains the impact debris that resettled in a layer of sediment at end-Permian time.  They also found "shocked quartz" in this area and in Australia. "Few Earthly circumstances have the power to disfigure quartz, even high temperatures and pressures deep inside the Earth's crust," Becker said.  Quartz can be fractured by extreme volcanic activity, but only in one direction. Shocked quartz is fractured in several directions and is therefore believed to be a good tracer for the impact of a meteor.  Becker discovered oil companies in the early 70's and 80's had drilled two cores into the Bedout structure in search of hydrocarbons. The cores sat untouched for decades. Becker and co-author Robert Poreda went to Australia to examine the cores held by the Geological Survey for Australia in Canberra. "The moment we saw the cores, we thought it looked like an impact breccia," Becker said. Becker's team found evidence of a melt layer formed by an impact in the cores.  In the paper, Becker documented how the Chicxulub cores were very similar to the Bedout cores. When the Australian cores were drilled, scientists did not know exactly what to look for in terms of evidence of impact craters.  Co-author Mark Harrison, from the Australian National University in Canberra, determined a date on material obtained from one of the cores, which indicated an age close to the end-Permian era. While in Australia on a field trip and workshop about Bedout, funded by the NSF, co-author Kevin Pope found large shocked quartz grains in end-Permian sediments, which he thinks formed as a result of the Bedout impact. Seismic and gravity data on Bedout are also consistent with an impact crater.  The Bedout impact crater is also associated in time with extreme volcanism and the break-up of Pangea. "We think that mass extinctions may be defined by catastrophes like impact and volcanism occurring synchronously in time," Becker said. "This is what happened 65 million years ago at Chicxulub but was largely dismissed by scientists as merely a coincidence. With the discovery of Bedout, I don't think we can call such catastrophes occurring together a coincidence anymore," she added.

						   Today marks the 34th anniversary of my birth. On this day, at 4:58 p.m. I came howling into the world with a voice so clear and loud that my mother could hear me through her sedation; now they have epidurals for the pain, back then they practically knocked women out with gas and medication.  I’m not sure what to think at the moment, or should I say that I’m not quite sure how to parse it all out and write it.  It has nothing to do with growing old. My family has a history of not only making it into their nineties, and doing so with a lot of vim, vigor, and mental cohesion. In short, the only thing that kills in my family is disease, or the occasional accident. So, needless to say, being thirty-four still means I’m a “kid.”  I do have to admit, though, that as of late my mind has steered very much towards time and change as it is found in people’s lives, as well as the perceptions tied to them. Before the discovery of my grandparents’ love-letters during World War II, while my mother was putting things into storage for her future move, well, being the snoop that I am, I took the liberty of going into our family photo box.  Some people do genealogies to find out who they were related to, but for me, you might say I was doing a genealogy on myself, a kind of personal history. Actually, I should clarify and say that I am doing a genealogy of myself, present tense.  What I mean is this. I am rediscovering and remembering who I was growing up, finding old photos and trying to place an age to them, how old I was, what was going on that year. It’s a kind of research that both challenges both the personal memory as well as the normal research structure. While historians look at writings, and archaeologists look at artifacts and the settings they were found in, I’m having to work with my own memory.  I am also having to contend with a few other things, mainly realizations and discoveries.  Looking at old photographs from when I was a child, it’s hard to believe it was me. Back then I was vigorous, energetic, and slender showing absolutely no signs of the overweight woman I was to become. I have to admit, looking at the pictures, there’s a kind of mental separation, as if I’m looking at the photos of someone else, some other soul. More than a few times I look at them and wish that I had a child like that, a little, smiling, red-headed bundle of energy full of laughter and covered with freckles (I freckle less nowadays and burn more). It’s me, though, and there’s no doubt in my mind about it, even now my two front teeth are ever so slightly crooked, and one has a small chip out of it (slipped in the shower when I was eight or so and knocked it against the wall, all the dentist could do then was smooth it out).  The thing about archaeologists is that we live our lives working with the past, and always with the past of other people be it the rare individual or more normally a whole community, if not a whole culture. Even as a young girl I loved the past, from my days wrapped up in ancient Egyptian books to Greek gods and long-ago Rome. And yet I still love my present day sciences, downloading images online from the Hubble Telescope like a madwoman, and trying to learn new languages. I see the future, and it is rooted on the foundations of the past, on the people of the past, building, learning, creating, inventing, and above all passing on their knowledge. Some see the present and either don’t know about the underlying layers of history and knowledge, or have forgotten about them.  Example: Someone found out that  seventy-five parts saltpeter (potassium nitrate) finely ground, fifteen parts charcoal, and ten parts sulfur combined made an explosive compound later called gunpowder (75% Potassium Nitrate(KNO3) + 10% Sulphur (S) + 15% Carbon (C)). Since then, aside from neat fireworks and idiot-proof guns, it’s lead into the creation of rockets to launch items for space exploration as well as the science of aeronautics.  And so it goes, I dig for the layers underneath, to find the history that hopefully won’t be forgotten, or if it has, to bring it to light again.

						   4 July 2004  Interspersed with my grandfather’s letters, I’m also finding letters to my grandfather from a fellow named “Mike.” I think I’ve seen his picture, a photo of him in front of a tent, smiling and shirtless as he’s knelt down, holding his golden retriever. I don’t know if I still have the picture, or if I put it back in the family collection. I’ll have to check, and indeed in checking I find that I have it not. I don’t have many of the old photos come to think of it. I have one of my great-grandparent’s Noonan, my mother’s mother’s parents, and a photo of my grandmother Bergmann in her heyday of young-womanhood in my daily planner.  As I organize the letters into date order, I’m struck at how cutsey some of them are. A conversation in writing, my grandfather even notes how in love he is with my grandmother. I have to admit, I wonder if I’ve inherited some of this as that Lloyd and I can be cutely-affectionate towards each other, a kind of loving play.   I’m also finding bits and bobs of other things, a page torn from the Friday, August 13, 1943 Examiner covered with want ads (help wanted – woman and girls 18-45, Help wanted Men age 38-50 for example.   Also among things, I have found what looks to be a pen-pal letter to my grandmother from a Pfc. Everett Heacock based at the Army Air Forces Technical School a the Lincoln Air Base in Lincoln, Nebraska.   There’s even a little insert on the war by Southwestern Bell Telephone Company.   I also found an unopened letter from a Pfc. Harry Kowalksi based out of the U.S.M.C. Air Base in Mojave, California, dated July 9 1943  There’s a hand-written note in pencil given to my grandmother calling her “babe,” but I’m confounded as to who it is. Although no name is given, the author mentions that he’s the “guy” to get her to my grandfather. Interestingly enough, this person strikes me both as a Roman Catholic, as well as someone who knows my grandmother’s parents since they mentions “pray just a little harder also for the sinner you have for a mother.”   An added note here...I found another letter addressed to “Dearest Baby & Ernie” written in the same hand. Reading it, everything points to my great-grandfather Noonan, my grandmother’s father.   One more added note...I found yet a third letter in the same hand addressed to “Baby,” it’s signed “From Mother” which would mean that it was from Genevieve Noonan.

						   Just like everyone else on this planet, I'm having one of those days in which I feel sloggy and all around non-productive. Then again, it's been my day off, as well as my rest and recover from Monday day.&nbsp; Which means that I slept a good ten hours.  I attained some of my goals for the day: got in my five servings of fruit and vegetables (a banana, and lots of edamame!), and my six servings of water (actually got in eight-I use a 44 oz. thermal mug), but I didn't get in my exercise, no, instead I took a break and watched 5 episodes of "X-Files" on DVD before returning them to Netflix.  Yes, I am not always cerebral, although I think I have one of my professors convinced that I'm just shy of being out of my mind...something about taking Ancient Greek, Latin, and German this autumn semester. What can I say, I don't like being board. :-)  This bit is just for me, an accounting to myself:&nbsp;    Breakfast:  5.5points  1 serving Honey Bunches of Oats Cereal (2 points) 1/2 cup of 2%&nbsp;milk&nbsp;(1.5 points) medium banana (2 points)     Lunch:  10.5 points  Peter Pan Reduced Fat Peanut Butter (1 Tbsp) (2.5 points) Jelly (1 Tbsp) (1 point) Healthy Life Whole Wheat Bread (2 pieces) (1 point) Edamame (3 servings) (6 points)&nbsp;    Dinner:  18 points  Jacks Cheeseburger Pizza (2 servings) (12 points) Edamame (3 servings) (6 points)    34 points total  8 servings water 7 servings fruits and vegetables 1.5 servings milk    Current weight:  (at least according to Lloyd's brother's scale)  240 lbs ...it might be 237, but the damn print is so small between each 10 lb. segment. This means I've lost between 5 and 8 pounds since last week.

						   Please pardon me if this isn't the clearests of posts. It's almost half-past nine in the evening, and I've been up since 4 a.m.. I'm trying desperately to stay awake until 10 or so, and then get a full night's sleep.  Mondays, until university starts back up, are my 5 a.m. days over at work...opening the building, etc. for our members to start coming in at 5:30 am. Thankfully, it was a blessedly calm (for a Monday!) day with a few smiles and a few successes interspersed.  For starters, I've been trying for the past month to convince my body that it really should loose weight, shed the fat, lighten up, and generally be treated well in a healthy way. The good news is, I haven't gained any weight, and I think I've dropped&nbsp;four pounds this past week. The bad news is, my body is apparently being quite stubborn, and I'm not doing what it needs to get a proverbial kick in the pants. Then again, it may be just trying to wait me out and seeing if I'm really serious this time. Either that or it's trying to see how frustrated I can get.  Then again, maybe it's just trying to tell me that it's not going to shed the weight until I get things right and treat it properly. Really, I'm hoping it's just that.  So, my list of things to eventually get to all at once (goals) 6-8&nbsp; 8 oz. glasses of water per day 5&nbsp;&nbsp;servings of fruits and vegetables per day 1/2 an hour of exercise per day (alternate between cardio and stregnth) 2 servings of milk product And perhaps taking up again the Weight Watchers "diet" program  For some this might not seem like a big deal, for me and how busy I get, it's like trying to herd cats, or kids as the case may be.  Honestly, I'm starting to share Lloyd's concern about my eating habits. No, I don't go binging on ice-cream or chocolate chip cookies, I do just about the exact opposite, I won't eat&nbsp;anything most of the time and then have a sizable meal. I may, emphasis on  may  have a bowl of cereal in the morning before I head off to work, but take nothing with me. So, for eight hours I don't eat. I come home hungry and end up having 5 crab rangoon, an egg roll, a half patty of egg foo young, and a cup or two of chicken fried rice with beansprouts.   This is not a good thing, and besides, I'm not a stick figure, at 245 pounds I'm far from being a stick figure!&nbsp; My body's probably gone into famine mode, trying to reserve every ounce of energy it gets like gold.  Okay, now that I seemed to have wined enough, I'll go get my cheese, parse this out in the morning, but meanwhile I can leave with a bit of a chuckle. Or at least a smile and then a chuckle.  I've tickled one of the members of the Y pink today, an older lady from Korea who was dropping off her grandkids for daycamp. I noticed she was a Korean-emigree when I saw the lunch bag that one of the boys was carrying, and waited until she came out to say anything.  "Yobosayo," I said after her as she was leaving, having been told by someone that it meant "goodbye."  She paused for a moment and turned around, so I said it again and asked if I got the word correct.&nbsp; She smiled broadly with her great wrinkled face and came up to the desk. She told me she spoke little English, but she taught me easily enough. "Yobosayo" meant "hello," while "Ameeyoekaseo" meant "good-bye" in Korean. I said "khamsa-hamneedah" which means "thank-you" in Korean, and we both smiled broadly like kids. I was so happy to learn, and she was more than happy to teach before she headed out the door.  I told Lloyd about it later in the day. His comment was that it was apparent that I was spreading out in the neighborhood of job opportunities. He knows I have a love for learning languages. While some folks complain about how people need to learn to speak English before they move to the U.S., for me I want to learn at least some of the languages to make their transition easier. I mean I know what it feels like just to visit a foreign country and not speak more than a few words of the language. It's frustrating! Communication is the life-blood of connecting with other people.  And here's the laugh...  Yesterday I went out to my mother's new home to go mow the lawn as I promised. Note here that what I meant to mow was the 10 acres of lawn that she has. After giving a reverse mohawk to the field in the back and stalling out, I decided to try to cut the front field by trimming around the edges and working inwards.   Okay, first of all aside from this being 10 acres of grass, it's 10 acres of tall, wet grass, and although I'm on the riding lawnmower, it's been a good 14 years since I last cut grass. Needless to say, I stalled out repeatedly and thought it was the grass getting caught under the blades until I started smelling smoke. So, rushing back to the house in hopes of smothering the fire I feared with fast wind, I called to Lloyd for water. All the while, in the back of my mind, I was imaginging little flames underneith the blades, and the thought that I might catch the field afire, but also burn up the lawnmower.  Well, it wasn't quite what I feared...it was just the engine overheating due to the mower trying to cut wet grass, as my mother informed me later when she finally returned home.  So, my co-workers got a chuckle today with my story of nearly setting the riding lawnmower on fire.   Oh, yes, and my mother did put Lloyd and I to work when she got home, moving furniture and wiring up her television. We're supposed to go back on Wednesday afternoon to help out some more.  Well, it's finally 10 p.m. and I think I shall carry myself off to bed. Lloyd's brother is out, his mother is upstairs playing Mah-Jong on her computer (she's addicted), and Lloyd himself is either watching  X-Files  on DVD, or playing  Abe's Odessey  on my old Sony Playstation.  Oh, yeah, and I started reading Aldous Huxley's  Brave New World , and although I'm only a couple of chapters in, the fact that he first published the novel in 1932 just absolutely blows my mind. In other words, he's got his science down pat even for the year 2004 to some degree, and thus far it's been a great and frightening read.

						   As Terry Pratchett once wrote in  Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy , "Time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so." Although time goes in one direction, it is truly elastic, expanding&nbsp; to too much when it is not needed (say in a dentist's chair, or worse, in a meeting), and contracting to too little when you really want it (when was that report due?).  Time for me is a rubberband, and occasionaly it ricochets out of control off the floor, the ceiling, and the nearest human body (the cats have the common sense to get out of the way).  To sum up in a hopefully painless way, work has kept me busy, my mother has kept me busy, and my cats have made it clear that the bed I sleep in is actually theirs, and that I'm just borrowing space they'd rather not give up.  Working at the YMCA has been enjoyable, interesting, and far from boring. Between phones, the computer, and checking in members while handing out towels, I'm learning to multi-task like a five-ring circus with the occasional rampant lion or elephant. You see, if there's one thing I've learned is that people on the whole, or at least those at the Y, are genrally good, patient, and if they've got a problem or a complaint then they say so in a civil manner and that's that. Then there's the occasional lion-elephant, and even then those creatures are more docile than these&nbsp;two members whose tempers exploded this past week.  Let me start by saying that at the front desk of the YMCA, the people who work there are pretty much the communication center of the building, but they are not the ones who make the decisions in regards to how the building and programs are run. That is for the administration to do, simple as that. So when there's a problem with the placement of the equipment in the fitness center, or some machine isn't working right, then we pass the information on to the appropriate person and they address those particular issues.&nbsp; Almost all the members at the Y seem to understand this, except for a couple, who if they do understand it, completly ignore it and rant like ill-mannered three-year-olds throwing a temper-tantrum because they can't get what they want.  Interestingly enough, those ill-mannered three-year-olds throwing temper tantrums of late have been&nbsp;grown adult men, of which only one I have faced, and thankfully someone else was there to intercept him.  Look, it is one thing to air ones grievences, to say that there's a problem and give suggestions as to how you'd like it fixed, especially asking if there is a particular person you need to talk to about it.&nbsp;It is another thing to rant, rave, and attack people who aren't even there, let alone a whole body of people. It's even worse when it's done to people who have no control over the situation let alone any say.  Just last Wednesday (and I was thankfully not there for this) a man came in at 6 p.m. wanting a basketball. One of the ladies behind the service counter informed him that the gym was currently in use by the Wednesday Basketball League, and that the entire court was being used until 10 p.m. that night. And so she warned him as she went to get him a basketball&nbsp;that he might not get a chance to play. Oh, the man threw a fit spouting that he was a doctor and a member and that he knew the head of the company whose name graced our building&nbsp;(which, although it's the name of our building, it only means that they sponsored the building of it), and that he wanted a basketball, that we weren't giving him one, and he kept repeating that he was a doctor and a memeber like it would get him special treatment or that he was far more intelligent than the people behind the desk.&nbsp; After about twenty minutes of this tirade, he went on down to the gym, and as one of the managers (and administrator) put it shot off a couple of "granny-shots" for a few minutes until the league nudge him off. And it didn't stop there, he called up to the desk from the lockerroom demanding to speak to the manager, as that the manager, a woman, had answered, she said that she was indeed the manager. No, he said, he wanted to speak to the manager, he wanted to speak to the man. The only man on duty that night, a really laid-back guy by the name of "Tom," was handed the phone, the poor guy, and heard a whole rant on how the doctor had been fond of basketball and playing basketball since he was a small child, and how just holding the basketball would allow him to learn things and that the women up at the front desk were loathe to give him a basketball. As the doctor left, he grabbed a piece of paper, wrote down everyone's name including the manager (whose first name he kept mispronouncing), and even asked Tom's name, who looked at the guy and asked "What did I do?" since he had not been in the middle of all of this. Then the doctor stormed out.  Well, Dr. Pang has no doubt already received his letter from the head of Membership Services saying that although we are there to serve his needs and help him, we are not there to take that kind of behaviour, and that such abuse is unacceptable. Oh, yes, and there were witnesses to his tirade to say the least. One fellow was sitting at a table in the lobby just shaking with quiet laughter, while a newly married couple asked the doctor's name (after he had gone down to the locker rooms) so that they knew who they absolutely didn't want as their physician in any aspect.  Yesterday, and I thank heavens for having the co-workers I have, a fellow came in at 9 a.m. asking why there couldn't be any pool lanes open at that hour (there are swim lessons and water aerobics at that hour attended by our senior citizens and our youngest members with their parents), and he went on ranting about how he spent so much money for a family membership and that his son couldn't go down to play basketball during the day because the day-camp took over the gym until 6 p.m. To leave it at that would have been one thing, but then he added something rather intolerable. He went on to rant, "What is the&nbsp;YMCA doing, trying to squeeze out every last dollar possible? They're turning this building into a nursery. Meanwhile, his son was out playing basketball in the 100 degree heat." At that point he wasn't there to rant or complain, he was there saying "Me! Me! Me! I want! I want! I want!" and&nbsp;he was getting absolutely no sympathy or understanding from me. Frankly, I was about ready to tell him that if he felt that the membership was not suiting his needs that he could cancel his membership, and if he had bought the full year package we would gladly refund the balance.  As I said before, thankfully my more experienced co-worker was there as that she partially placated the man, as if he could be placated, as he walked through the doors into the main part of the facility (where he was going, I don't know, as that he felt he couldn't swim).&nbsp; We were going to have him speak to the manager on duty, but I don't know if this ever happened as that we were supposed to snag him on the way out. Hopefully my co-worker saw him leave and got him as that I didn't.  Other than that, I really enjoy seeing members come in. The children of all ages are an absolute hoot, lots of energy and lots of fun. Our senior citizens, whom I enjoy calling "silver foxes" are people I greatly admire. They have so much energy, so much spunk, even our 90-somethings! A few of them look so frail, but they are up and moving, and getting out to socialize and all that, things that my grandfather didn't do.  A side note here as I write, if I seem to be meandering off it's only because I'm being talked at by my significant other who has a gift of rambling like a brooke in flood. I love him, but he doesn't quite understand that I can't hold a discussion very well while I'm trying to write (which gets rather infuriating if I'm trying to do another entry for the story/novel/series/tome I'm co-writing).  Right, so, my mother's now moved into her new (to her) home out in the "country," nearly half-way between St. Louis and Hannibal (or at least somewhere on the way). I spent days earlier this month packing, and got off work early to help out with the movers to take stuff from the house and put it into one of the four storage lockers she had rented; she had to move out by the 12th, but the new house wasn't ready until the 20th. And again, I helped her, the eight movers with the four vans, move from the four lockers to her new home on the 21st.  I've got to say this, I'm already nestling comfortably into the thought that the new house in Moscow Mills is now the family home, and some place I can live should the need arise.   Now I've just finished being told the events for the entire last episode of  Stargate: Atlantis , although I never asked for the information.  Anyhow, back to my mother's new home. It's a 10 acre plot of land with a two-storey house with a finished basement making it a total of five bedrooms, three baths, an office area, a large kitchen, dining room, living room/sunroom, family room, and a storage room. There's an above-ground pool in the backyard, a playhouse for the kids, and two small storage sheds. There's also sotrage space in the attic which is sorely needed considering all of the stuff moved. Note: this is a combination of my things, my mother's things, and things inherited/received after my grandparents' deaths. The neighbor on the left has two horses, the neighbor through the woods on the right breeds and raises dogs, and my mother's going to raise alpaca's and use their wool.  Oh, yes, and there's a small cemetary at the back of the property. Unfortunately, the grove that its in has become overgrown, and I can only see one pillar-type burial marker, but only from a distance at which I can't read it. Although some folks would possibly get creeped-out by this, for me (and my mother too, I think) and my sister it's a sign that this is a good land, and that we're blessed to have the privilage to care for the burial ground. Yes, while some would think of ghosts as being bad things, we consider it good. And a small cemetary means that whomever was buried there had lived there, and that they were so well loved that they were buried close to home. That's the important word "home."   Speaking of which, I need to get myself together and head out that way with Lloyd. Although my mother's sleeping at the moment (she works night shift as a nurse at a local hospital), I had told her that I'd be coming out this weekend to mow the property because it needs it badly! That and I'm kind of hoping that I can get a picture of the cemetary, and&nbsp;start making plans on how to clear it out enough undergrowth to tend to it properly, and keep the wildflowers!  I know it sounds strange, but when my mother told me about the cemetary, I went straight out to see it (of course! I am the curious one after all). She said it was fenced in, but I found that the fence was only on one side, and that there was a cut pathway around the back (someone had mowed a path for the surveyors a couple of weeks ago). Aside from seeing the single-pillar stone (kind of like an obelisk), I saw a number of wildflowers and a huge black and gold butterfly. It also struck me as to how sweet the air smelled. It was absolutely delightful.  Now, if only I can keep journalling daily. I shall endevour to make it my goal to do so.

						   Let me start by saying that I love my sister. She's sweet, good-natured, and eventhough she's nearly eight years younger than I am, we've never had a fight, let alone a squabble. As her big sister, I guess I will be playing the role of big-sister for the rest of my life, of which I have no complaint. I don't need to loom over her, I'm just there to help her out when she needs it.  Then there's her husbad.  Aside from two small children with a third on the way, her husband is one of the biggest reasons she needs all the help she can get...mainly around hte house.  "I'll mow the lawn," he says, only to put it off for weeks at a time. And as for taking out the garbage, he'll get around to it...when he remembers.  So, to make a long story short, at the moment I am taking a brief break to grumble about my brother-in-law being lazy while I help my sister out.  As I was telling my mother, it's difficult enough to unpack a house after moving. Ratchet that up a bit with two little ones under five, while very pregnant, and with a husband who doesn't do much save take up space when he comes home from work.  I will say that my brother-in-law can be a good guy, but he just acts like he's trying to remain a kid, taken care of by his parents, and now his wife, and with little responsability save to go to work and bring home money.  *sigh*  He can't even clean up after himself it seems...cook, yes, and very well at that, but clean? No.  Good men are hard to find, and the one's who actually take responsibility around the house are even rarer. It's getting to be that the requisite for a marriagable man isn't how he looks, or if he's good in bed, but if he does dishes, the laundry, mows and paints.  Here's hoping there are good men in the world, because even my significant other is barely a good man along those perameters.  Back to work!
