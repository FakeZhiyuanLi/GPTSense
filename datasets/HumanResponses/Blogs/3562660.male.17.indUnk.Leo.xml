      Today, Monday, was the first day I had to attend a class. It was for "Elements of Computer Science Using Java" which is held every Monday and Wednesday at 6 - 8:30pm . Apart from those lectures, we are required to attend two section per week. We have a a schedule to choose from, But I think I will be choosing the section right after the lecture. The sections, I think, will actually be the "hands on" part of the course, besides all of the homework ofcourse. So, if I am combining them, on Mondays and Wednesdays I will be busy from 6 - 9:30.  I woke up at 10 in the morning today. I went over to the activities center with Dana and Linessa, and some friends of theirs. We signed up for some activities that will be held during the summer. After that I had to go buy a few more things that I needed for my class. Such as a notebook, backpack, and some other stuff.  I will be waking up earlier tomorrow. Probably around 7:45 because I have my "Introduction to Still Photography" class at 9 in the morning. I'm looking forward to that class.  Right now, I just finished the little homework that we had for the computer class. I learned how to send an e-mail in a UNIX based program and I also created my first program. (Well it was a very basic thing, we are being introduced to it) But either way, it is cool watching a program that you just helped create work perfectly. This will be an interesting class.  Well, We'll see what happens in tomorrow's photography class. I'll keep you posted.

      Well I am finally here at Harvard and so far it's badass.  My friends and I got to Harvard around 1 or so Saturday afternoon. We got our room keys and went to our dorms. I was the first out of three people in my room. There are a total of 3 people  in my dorm, including me. My roommates are Emir from Minnesota and Ravi from California. They're cool!  My room is decent. I think it could be a little bit better, but what the hell am I supposed to expect. It's a freakin' dorm. The one thing that sucks so much is that We do not have our own private bathroom. My whole floor (which are all males, about 5 rooms, each consisting of maybe 3-5 people) share a community bathroom. It has one toilet, two urinals, and 3 SMALL showers. I showered this morning, and i accidentally hit the shower knob several times and made the water hotter.  I think all from friends from back home, except Linessa who is in the same hall as I am,  have their own private bathroom. Bastards!  I've met some really cool people besides my roommates already. Andrew (New  York), Franchesco and his friend from Italy (I do not know how to spell his name), Dana (Louisiana), and Rodrigo (Nicaragua). Most of them are rooming with one of my friends, and another one of them is from the same hall as mine.  So all 11 of us went to go eat dinner tonight at some pizza place. I believe it was called Pinochio's or something like that. Very Good pizza.  Ohh yeah btw, Harvard square is awesome. At each corner, there is some sort of entertainment going on. Either there will be a group of people break dancing, a three-member band , A two-some with only drums and a synthesizer, or a solo artist playing his gutiar. Pretty nice.   I start my first class tomorrow, which is Elements of Computer Science Using Java. I'm able to wake up late since the lecture won't start until 6 in the afternoon. So that's good news. I will take that class Mondays and Wednesday. Ohh yeah, I went to go buy the book that is required for this course, and I look at the price....AND IT'S $107! I didn't think it would be that expensive. My roommates paid much less for their books. This sucks.  My other class, Introduction to Still Photography, will take place on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 9 am. This one girl I already met, Dana, will be taking the same class. So that's cool! Thank God I don't need any books for this class. Well, as of now  that is.  I'm off Fridays ... ... ... PARTY!  Well I think I will go to sleep already , I have to wake up tomorrow and go sign up for some activities that will take place during our stay here at Harvard.  I'll keep you guys posted.

      It is about 2:30 or so in the morning. I have to wake up in an hour and a half so that I can shower and get to the airport on time. I hate to be rushing in the morning.  I'm all done packing. My mom says I packed too much, but oh well. Better safe than sorry. All I am waiting for now is to get some small amount of sleep. If I don't then I'll sleep on the four hour flight to Boston.  My plane leaves at 5:45 from Laredo to Houston. Then I'll head to Boston from there.  Don't have much to say tonight. Let's just hope everything goes well during my two month stay in Boston.  Harvard (Summer School Program), oh boy, here we go.

      Ok. So I am at the Wendy's drive through. Someone mutters something out of the speaker box and I assumed she wanted my order. So I go ahead and order a classic single with cheese....5 seconds of quietness..."Can you hold on one moment please?" I was like ok. She comes back a minute later and I proceed with my order. I know I was speaking clearly but she still had trouble with my order...hmm I wonder why. "$4.59 please drive up".. I drive up, and there she was, ON HER FREAKING CELL PHONE!! She told me how much my order was and I pad her. And when the guy behind me is about to order, she tells him to hold up. All this just because she wants to talk to her girlfriends on the phone. Idiot. She should a deduction from her pay for that. :)  Oh yeah! On my way back from Mexico City I had another experience with an employee. This time it was with a stewardess. I called for her by pushing a button so she came. The drinks had already been served but I wanted more because my  mouth was very dry. Not cool. So she came and I asked if they were still serving drinks. She let out some breath (kind of like a sigh, a kind of "ugh" sigh). My aunt and I were like wtf. So she asked what I wanted and I told her I wanted a sprite. Damn small cups they serve you. So as she is leaving she asks if I was asleep and I said no. So I think this made her more pissed off. This is no way for a stewardess to act. Thank god my mom wasn't with me. She would have blown her head off arguing with her. I was going to tell her something, but it was no biggy so I let it go. So she finally came back, not with one, but two sprites. It was her way of telling me (Spanish)"Ten, para que ya  no estes chingando". I don't know how to say it in english exactly. I don't think it would have the same impact. It's like saying "stop bitching" or something like that. Even my mom, who was a few rows further, asked for another drink and got it from a guy with no problem at all. I guess it was that time of month for this lady. Imagine, all cramped up and trying to balance yourself while serving other people, ouch. If it was  bad enough to keep her from doing your job right, then she should not have gone to work then.  Anyways, It's Wednesday night (more like Thursday morning). I have been shopping these passed coupled of days for some items that I am missing for my trip to Boston. I am kind of freaking out because I have no idea what to expect. I have never been in a situation where I would have to room with a complete stranger. I hope all goes well. I think I'll start packing tomorrow, Thursday night. Hope I don't forget anything.  I haven't been doing much otherwise. Just been to the mall with my mom, bowling with some friends, and going to the gym. That's about it.  I will probably update one more time before I leave.  Ohh yeah I forgot. Just in case any of you wanted to see pyramids I visited in Mexico, below is the link to a photo album. The pictures are alright. Nothing big, except the pyramids. Enjoy.  http://homepage.mac.com/edwardg87/PhotoAlbum6.html  (Note: None of the photographs have been cropped or edited. I will have to do that sometime later.)

      I am tired. This is what I have done the past few days.  18-June-04 I woke up aroun 9 in the morning because we were going to visit some pyramids. The drive was about and hour and a half out of Mexico. Once we got there, we ate a little something before we walked towards the pyramids. We needed something in our stomachs before we were going to climb those things.  I thought my sister was going to back out from climbing the pyramids, but to my spurprise, she didn´t. These things are pretty big and it is just beautiful once you´re at the top. You can see the whole valley.  Our legs are killing us though. It was quite a work out for us. I will upload my pictures once I get back home and I will post the link here so you all can see what I am talking about.  We then went home, took a nap, and afterwards we went to some party/dinner. Won´t even comment on how that went.  19-June-2004 Today I woke up at 10. I took a shower and then i woke up my sister. The words that came out of her mouth were.."ask mom if I can take the computer in the shower". Haha. I started laughing and I continued in waking her up and getting her ass in the shower.  So we left and we were going to some birthday party. FULL OF LITTLE 5 YEAR OLD KIDS!! not cool. So my uncle saw that my sister and I were getting bored and he asked us if we wanted to go to six flags for a while. We agreed because we were fucking bored. He dropped us off at six flags. It was weird being in a Six Flags with Mexican music playing all over the place. I guess I was used to the Six Flags in San Antonio.  We only got on two rides in the 3 hours that we were there. The lines were super long, but the wait was kind of worth it. I convinced my sister to get on these two roller coasters. She was freaked out at first but then she wanted to get back on them, but we had no time. We then got picked up and went back to the apartments where my mom and aunt were waiting for us to pick them up.  We picked them up and went to "Palacio de Hierro" which is a mall. It is fucking badass. They have a lot of stores. I saw this one pair of jeans that were badass and I wanted them, well because I need another pair. No wonder I liked them so much, they were Armani Jeans and they were around 300 or so dollars. I freaked out. How the fuck can someone pay so much for a pair of jeans.  After the mall, we went to "el Zocalo", which is the historical center of Mexico. There was going to be a concert by Pablo Milanes. He is a cuban singer who sings some type of ballads. So instead of watching him from the floor area, we made reservations on one of the resteraunts located on top of a hotel overlooking the concert. The hotel´s name was "Majestic" and it is a part of Best Western.  I must say that experience was just plain awesome. While we were eating, we were listening to soft, ballad type music,(it was a nice setting to be with your family or youré gf/bf) and watching the beautiful architecture of the historical Mexico City. The lights lit the buildings perfectly, and the huge Mexican flag in the middle of the plaza was waving.  Right now I am in the apartment updating this and just killing time. I have to pack my stuff because I will be leaving back home tomorrow. Yeah! I will spend one week in Laredo and then I will be off to Boston for the summer program that I will attent at Harvard. I will be spending the rest of my week packing and getting everything together.  I will keep you guys posted and I will try to upload my pictures and post the link here so that you can see the pyramids that we visited.

      I had no sleep whatsoever last night. I went to bed at 5:30 but had to wake up at six. So this was pretty funny because usually, when my family and I go out on vacation, well we donÃÂ´t wake up sleepy, but instead we go with a good mood. A kind of "hurry" mood, but fun. So I sat next to my sister on the plane and we both ordered our Sprites. She was kind of annoying at first but then she got calm. It was then time to turn off our electrica equipment such as CD players and lap tops. So I turned my iPod off and put in betweenn my legs. I also had my sisterÃÂ´s sprite which she did not finish. My head then slowlfounddn its way against the window and I was loosing control. My eyes were shutting down on me. Next thing I know, My hand gets loose and I let go of the sprite, spilling a bit of it on my iPod and my jeans. This kind of woke me up a little bit because I got pissed.  We then said goodbye to my mom and my aunt. I arrived at our apartment and I found out that....IT´S DIAL UP!!! I am on the internet on a dial up connection. Although, I actually think it is some sort of T1 thing, but it is still not as fast as the cable back at home. And then to top it off, the keyboard is Mexican so all of the symbols are all over the damn keyboard. So excuse me if I have many typos and such.  My sister took the opportunity to take a small nap. I didn´t take a nap, so I was still without any sleep.  We then went to go eat at "Tacos El Caminero". Came home, and I finally took a two hour nap. It felt fucking good. Then I woke up, went with my uncle to run an arrend and then go eat again. This time at "El Fogoncito". Damn Good!  Right now I am in the apartment, trying to find something entertaining to do. No luck so far. I will probably listen to music for a little while and get a good long sleep for tomorrow. I think what we have planned for tomorrow is go to some pyramids an hour and a half away from Mexico. I want to climb a pyramid. Then at night I think we will be going to some formal dinner type thing. Oh well.  Keep you guys posted.

      Today started off in a bit of a rush. My sister woke me up telling me to take a quick shower and change because my dad was already on his way. We were going to Nuevo Laredo. I needed my permit stating that my dad is allowing for me to go with my mom out of the country. Yeah I know, weird. So we went, and after that we went to go eat at "El Rincon Del Viejo". Its alright, kind of slow service though.  I was on my way home and Hector called me. He was with Luis. So I met up with him at his house and we decided to go either play pool or bowling.  I chose bowling and so we went. Only hector and me. OK So we get there and I did my first throw, goes off to the side but still manages to hit a couple of pins. That was bad. Second throw.....GUTTER! So it's my turn again. First throw, GUTTER once more! This was sucking balls and I was looking pretty bad. In two tries, I had 4 point. Pathetic I know.  So then Hector said I should stop trying to throw it straight and throw curve balls instead. I said, ehh wtf I got nothing to loose at this point. And so he taught me how to throw a curve . I tried it for the first time on my second chance on my second try. (Did that make sense? I don't know how to explain bowling )So I did and I hit a few of them. I was like WOAH, COOL! So it's my third try and I give it a go to with this curve ball. STRIKE! YEAH BABY! This was awesome. I ended up beating him the first game with 112 points. Not much but I am barely learning how to throw curve balls. I got pretty good at it. We played two more games. I beat him the second game and he won the third. I think We will be playing this a bit more often.  Now I am here in my room trying to  get my luggage together. I leave tomorrow morning to Mexico City. (Yes, I was obligated to go) Actually, I have to wake up in 3 hours because the plane leaves in about 5 or 6 hours. Not sure.  The people going are my mom, my aunt, my sister and I. We fly from Nuevo Laredo to Mexico. Although, from Mexico, My mom and my aunt will be flying to Huatulco (some beach to the west coast I think). My sister and I will be staying at my grandfather's apartments with a friend of the family. I think the only interesting things we will be doing is eat delicious food and maybe go to some pyramids. oh the joy (sarcasm). So practically, I'm babysitting for this vacation. Shit!  Hopefully I will be able to get online over there. Supposedly one of the rooms in the apartments has a computer with internet on it. I pray to god its cable or something fast. I'm hoping I can be able to get online and update this, I think it will be my only way of entertaining myself. But then again, knowing the guy who we're staying with, he will be taking us up and down the whole damn city. Ohh well, we'll see what happens.   Wish me luck.

      Well, I am back home.  We spent the day on Saturday shopping for some of my brother's furniture. We had a bit of trouble though because originally, it was planned for us to buy him mostly everything at IKEA. Turned out they were having a close-out sale because they are trying to get rid of everything so they can able to open their new facility. I never thought it could be soo damn tiring.  My parents were tired and wanted to go back to the hotel. So we dropped them off. My uncle and I decided to go look at two computer stores. We first went to Comp USA, it was alright. We then went to a store called Micro Center. Holy crap! They have it all folks. All types of computers, digital imaging, audio, everything!  I was planning on going out with my brother and his friends on Saturday night. Maybe go to some bars or something. Didn't happen. I was so fucking tired, I had to get some rest. I told him I will go visit him some other time and we'll go party then.  We left Houston today around 5 or so. It started raining heavily when we were leaving the city. But before we were caught in the rain, we stopped at target so we could by trash bags so we could cover up our luggage and prevent them from getting wet. I also bought the movie Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. I had not seen it so I decided I would watch it now instead of falling asleep on the road. Damn! It is an awesome movie. Long, but awesome.  We arrived at 10:30 and here I am now. Just thought I would update my web log. I only have about two weeks left to get ready before I leave to Boston. Actually, about a week and a half since going to Mexico will take up some of that time.   I'll update this again, soon as something interesting happens.

      Alright, so we left a little later than expected. Blame it on the huge blackout Laredo had earlier today. The lights went out around 3 or 4 in the afternoon. I called my mom and checked if she had forgotten to pay the bill again (happened with the water yesterday). My mother was at the mall and the lights were out there as well. Downtown Laredo was also without power. Supposedly something had happened to an energy plant up the river. We aren't sure yet. Would have been kind of cool if the lights went out during the night though. Too bad.  So we left around 7:45 pm. We went to the gas station to fill up our tanks. Dad's truck gets filled, then my mustang. I was in the store waiting, my dad(in the truck) and my uncle(in mustang) pull out of the station and go park somewhere else, dad in front of the mustang. All of a sudden, I see him reversing, and BAM! right into my mustang. I just stood there and I just shook my head because my dad  is a dumbass. Thank God nothing happened to the mustang though, just a small scratch.  So off we were, it was a pretty boring drive. Oh yeah, turns out I did not have to drive. My mom did. Bummer, I wanted to drive at least to San Antonio which is pretty easy. So I  talked to my best friend steph. We just talked about her and the things going on in her life. GOOD LUCK ON THE A.C.T. STEPH!! I'll put the link to your site later. We then stopped in the outskirts of San Antonio for a quick meal at Whataburger and we continued our drive to Houston.  My mom was pretty sad all the way up to Houston. I don't blame her. I bet it must be hard to let go of your son. We then got a call from my aunt who is staying at my house with my sister. Turns out Fifi (our chiwawa dog) had been crying ever since we left. Not just a gentle cry,but a loud cry. She was even shedding tears. And some people say dogs have no emotions. yeah, right. Apparently she was sitting at our front door staring outside, waiting for my brother to come back. She then went to my room and laid down on my brother's side of the closet.  So right now I'm in Houston. Staying at the embassy suites next to Galleria. You what this means right? We go shopping tomorrow! Yeah! My brother, we already dropped him off at his apartment and we will see him tomorrow so we can go and purchase some furniture for him.  Damn! My updates are long aren't they? Sorry, but it's 4:20 am and I am just so bored I have nothing else to do in a damn hotel room. I need to learn how to update with pictures and put up links.   I'll update some other time. For now, peace out :P .

      So tomorrow my family and I leave to Houston, Texas to go drop off my brother for college. And guess what? My mustang is going with him. Yup, that's right. This sucks. He always takes everything away from me. First my clothes, now my car. :'( . Haha ok , ok. So my brother is also the one who is leaving. Yeah, can't say I won't miss him. Always arguing and fighting with him. Oh well, that brotherly love for ya'.  It looks like I will be driving my aunt's car that we have here. And then I'll wait until they finish doing repairs on my brother's old car, a blue 2000 Jetta. I would post some pictures of my car on this, but I don't know how yet.  We leave tomorrow mid-afternoon I believe. My brother and I will go in MY mustang, and the rest of my family in my mom's car. I think I might have to drive up to Houston though, because my brother hates driving on highways from city to city. *sigh* the things I do for my brother.  So yeah...We should arrive at Houston by 9 or 10. Got to wait for my parents to get out of work. I'll try and see if I can log onto an internet service over at my hotel.

      Alright it is 2 in the morning and my mom got me thinking. She asked me if I wanted to go to Mexico city, not this weekend, but the following one. The reason this got me thinking is because if I do decide to go, all my weekends will be booked up until the 26th. This weekend I leave to Houston, Texas. My brother is leaving off to college and we are going to drop him off, and enjoy the city ofcourse. The weekend after that would be Mexico city. And the weekend after that? Boston. Mexico City is one awesome city, excluding all the dangerous walks out at night of course. But I am having trouble deciding.  Today...well,  I woke up and the sun was already coming down. Yes sir. I hate this shitty sleeping schedule of mine. I go to sleep at around 5 or 6 in the morning (so if any of you are up at that time, send me a message), and I end up waking up 12 hours later. Yeah! 12 hours! That's ridiculous. I end up waking up tired and pisses off. Not a good combination I must say. All I end up doing is wake up, shower, eat, go to gym, come home, end of day. Week days suck. I need to find something to keep me busy soon.  Soo yeah, just trying to keep this journal thing, I mean  blog thing, flowing. I'm off... probably play Hitman II or try and work out some graphics. Oh well. Laters.

      Alright, so this is my first time using this web log system that seems to be popular among many in the internet world. I am not sure if I should continue with this account or not. I still have to explore other sites out there. As for now, I will stick to this one and see how it all works out.  Why did I catch on to this "trend" and start  a web log.The reason. Well, the reason for me creating this is because I am gonna go off to Boston for two months this summer. This is the first time I will be so far away from home, away from my family, and I wanted to keep a log of what my days consist of , of what new experiences I encounter. So, I found it to be a nice idea to run this web log. With this, I can let me family and friends know how I'm doing.  I'll try to keep this updated daily,  although, not alot of exciting things happen on a daily basis around here.

      Woah. I haven't updated in quite a while. It is really late so I will try to make this short.  I had Friday off. I have no clue what I did. I can't remember. that sucks.  My classes have been going great. I actually developed my first roll of film on thursday, although I think I already talked about that.  I woke up late on saturday. Around 11 or 12. I showered and then I went to go  eat. Oooh I know what I did on Friday night, but that is not imp[ortant ;) . Anyways, after eating I met up with the whole gang and we were off to Worcester for the Incubus concert. We hauled ass towards the subway so we could get to the train station in time. We made in just in time. The train ride was about an hour and 25 minutes.  When we got to the venue, the opening band was already in their last couple of songs. The Vines were supposed to open up for Incubus, but a group named Sparta replaced them instead. I did not take the time to listen to them, instead I took the time to go buy an incubus shirt and some food.  Incubus came out around 8:30 and opend up with "Pistola". It was awsome. Then came "Nice to Know You". It was actually kind of funny. The crowd kind of got rowdy and started pushing towards the rail in front of the stage. During the second verse or so, Brandon Boyde (lead singer) tells his bandmembers to stop the music and he had to tell everyone to step back before someone got hurt. So they had to turn on the lights and replace the rail with a new one.  After 20 minutes the show continued on. It was an amazing show. One of the things I really liked was the fact that the lightshow was actually synchronized with the music. That is a very important aspect of a good concert. Another thing was that the band sounds very good as a live act. Brandon Boyde sure can sing pretty damn good.  Our ride back home was just satisfying. Great Show, Good Time. We got back to our Harvard dorms around 2:30.  Sunday night was cool. We went to go eat dinner at P.F. Changs before heading out for the fire works show. The Fire Works display we were going to watch were at the Charles river. It was breathtaking. The Bostgon skyline behind the show, and  with the river in front reflecting the colors being bursted out in the sky, amazing!  I had today Monday off! It was a holiday. I took this chance to wake up really late, late as in 2:30 I showered, went to go eat and then I came back home. I also took this time so that I could do my laundry. I hate doing laundry. Some people tell me to seperate the clothing and some tell me not to. What the hell! Ohh will it wasn't TOO bad. It just sucks because you have to wait, then dry, then wait, then fold. Ahh!  Well kids, it is extremely late. I think I will only get around two hours or so of sleep. NOT GOOD!. I don't want to mess up my photo prints tomorrow. Wish me luck.  I'll try to update some other time where I am not tired and I'm half asleep.  Peace!

      I haven't posted in a few days so I have a few things to post.  MY first photography class was on Tuesday. It was so cool. There are only about 10-15 people in that class so it gives us a chance to really interact with out professors. We sat down, got some handouts given to us and then Our professor, Edward Grazda, proceeded into showing us some slides. These slides had photographs from many famous black and white photographers. We will only be working with black and white film in this course. We then got our equipment and we were thought how to deal with it. These are old , fully manual, Pentax K1000 cameras. Grazda showed us how to load the film properly and then he gave us our first assignment. We were to go out and scout for letters in nature, weather it be trees, buildings, etc.  Today was the day we learned how to develop our own film in a dark room. Now when they say dark, they mean dark. Two people were to go into a room and open their film up and load them onto some type of rolls . I went in with Dana, my friend from Louisiana. Since is pitch black in the room, you aren't able to see anything obviously so you have to work your way around with nothing but your sense of touch and confidence. We have to open up the roll of film, cut off the edge of it, and carefully load it onto a wheel type thing that will later go into a "light safe container". After each roll of film was carefully placed in this container, it was then okay to turn on the lights.  After that was done, we then proceeded onto adding several chemicals into the container through a small hole located at the top of the container. We have to be really careful with the chemicals because if we mess up the order in which the 4 chemicals go in, that can ruin the film completely, or if we leave the chemicals in for more time than advised, then the film could potentially be badly effected as well.   I am going to enjoy this class so much.  Computers on the other hand, I think is getting more difficult. There are a lot of codes we have to remember and we have to input those codes carefully. One little small syntactical (punctuation) or lexical (misspelling) error can prevent the program from running and executing the commands.  So I am done with the first week of summer school here at Harvard University and it went pretty well. I have homework this weekend so I am going to try and get it all done as soon as possible.   Friday, I might go down to Boston with some friends. Then Saturday I will be going to the Incubus concert in Worchester, MA. Then Sunday will be the fourth of July. We might go downtown Boston again and celebrate it there. I will also have Monday off as a holiday.  I will keep you guys posted. Take care everybody.
