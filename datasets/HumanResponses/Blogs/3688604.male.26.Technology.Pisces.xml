						   Camping fucking rules.  If you're not sleeping on the hard ground out in the cold night air, the bones in your shoulders creaking and cracking and bending in weird ways as you lay upon the hard motherfucking dirt, you're not living.  NOT LIVING, I SAY.  Me?  I'm living.  I spent my weekend out at Branched Oak drinking myself retarded and passing out by the campfire.  The camping was fun, but the drinking has left me wanting some specific B vitamins and some god damn potassium.  POTASSIUM, CAN YOU SPELL IT, MR. ROGERS?!   On another subject entirely, the documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 has apparently polarized everyone's political opinions AGAIN.  I'm not exactly surprised by this; it seems to be the way of things with anything even remotely inflammatory, but why is it not possible for people to have a moderate view of things?  Keep in mind, I have not yet seen the movie, but this exact same thing happens with every Michael Moore movie released.  Bowling for Columbine especially.  Why can't everyone just recognize that Moore is a fat crazy bastard who makes remarkably entertaining and engrossing films which make some valid points but are really focused on INTENTIONALLY PUSHING YOUR BUTTONS?!  Do you think the guy gets up after making one of his movies and is ASTOUNDED to read an unfavorable review in the newspaper because he is too partisan?  No.  He sits there and plans the whole fucking thing while rubbing his greasy hands together and snickering maniacally to himself in the dark with Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother Suite playing in the background and dollar signs in his eyes, knowing that both his political friends AND enemies are going to flock to his movie and give him money because it is SO FUCKING CONTROVERSIAL.  OOOOOOOOHHHH.  He's not fucking around, he SERIOUSLY WANTS TO PISS YOU OFF AND YOU ARE JUST FINE WITH THAT, EVIDENTLY.  The BARON has MOTHERFUCKING spoken!

						   Are you wondering how I'm feeling?  I'm motherFUCKING hurt is how I'm feeling.  The whole thing breaks my heart again every time I think about it.  You want to read about how I react to things?  How about I let you in on a little secret - I'm not just some alcoholic for you to laugh at, I have some god damn feelings like any human being does and they've been in more than a bit of turmoil in the last few weeks.  It's not like I want to hang myself or anything but jesus FUCKING christ I seem to have a lot of pent up distress and it's really starting to get to me.  Wondering if it's a big deal to me, are you?  WELL YOU'RE GOD DAMN RIGHT IT IS.  On another subject entirely, why is it so HORRIBLY HOT on the upper floor of my house?!  It's like the fires of hell are burning just below, the heat from the flames rising through the vents, leaving a balmy sheen on my skin and causing my thermometer to burst in frustration.  Air conditioning, you say?  Well, my roommate's vent in the neighboring upstairs bedroom seems to be specifically shaped to divert as much of the cool air as possible into his room.  I'm getting nothing here.  ISN'T THAT CONVENIENT?!  One of these days you may see the confusing remains of my corpse featured on one of those Discovery channel specials about the mystery of spontaneous combustion.  Though this can only happen if they can spare a half an hour in which they don't show some fucking horrible reality show.  HAVE I MADE MYSELF CLEAR?  THE BARON HAS SPOKEN.

						   I saw Guided By Voices the other day.  Obviously, I ran into a lot of obsessive fans of theirs at the show - that seems to be the way of things with those guys.  Most of the die hards from Lincoln hung back after a fairly short time.  I keep hearing that GBV isn't what they used to be; that they are practically dead; that they lack energy, etc.  It really makes me wish I had even heard of them when they were supposedly in their heyday.  The show was completely fucking awesome.  Robert Pollard's personality pours off of him in waves hard enough to knock you the fuck over.  He really has quite a tremendous ability to get this across to the audience.  His band in general DOES kind of lack energy - the show felt most like Robert Pollard WITH Guided By Voices in that they were less a cohesive unit and more just a bunch of guys trying to follow a musical behemoth but not completely being able to keep up.  I'm just glad I got to see him with his band once before they're gone - I don't care what ANYONE else says, this was a damn great show.  On another subject entirely, I do have to say that that scottish gum on that Extra commercial PISSES ME THE FUCK OFF.  If you haven't seen this thing, it is a fucking piece of chewing gum with a three dimensional face who wanders about like he owns the place and talks with an intensely irritating Scottish accent.  Now don't get me wrong, I have no problem with Scotland, the home of my most favorite beverage, but JESUS CHRIST I SWEAR I am going to stomp on god damn Angus McGum with cletes on and then wipe him on a bike rack next to the golf course he likes to hang out at.  I'M THE TASTY CHEW THAT CAN OUTLAST YOU!  Outlast THIS you chewy little piece of SHIT!!  Anyway, on the latest commercial, I was praying Angus would drown in the water hazard but he's all like YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO STOP ME?! and he was JUST FINE.  Arrogant little bastard, he's like a cockroach during nuclear winter.  So at any rate, to sum up, FUCK YOU ANGUS.  Next time Extra uses him in a commercial it seems likely that I will suffer a stress induced heart attack.  It was nice knowing you.  Well that wraps this shitstorm up.  THE BARON HAS SPOKEN.

						   An awful lot of things smell like shit lately.    But hanging around with as many genuine folks as I seem to, it's kind of hard to see it that way sometimes.  I have no idea what that statement was all about, so you can consider it *abstract*.  Motherfucker, let me just rant and rave for a few unimportant moments about generic "pop punk".  We're talking Green Day offshoots here, because as far as I am concerned, those guys are solely responsible for the rapid proliferation of this "genre" of "music".  Jesus, I watched this band the other day - they weren't technically deficient or anything, it's just that everything about what they had come up with lacked imagination.  In its entirety.  They had no spark; nothing AT ALL that separated them from their peers - HOW IN THE FUCKING FUCK do they expect that they will be memorable?  And why did they seem somewhat surprised that they got no reaction whatsoever from the crowd?  I don't know, maybe I am just insane, but perhaps it has something to do with not accomplishing or even attempting to accomplish any one thing that distinguishes you from any other shitty band that ever had an over-inflated self opinion and bothered to WASTE MY FUCKING PRECIOUS TIME on stage with it.  Take your crappy, overdone, Green Day knockoff MTV garage band and cram it up your boring, syphilitic asses before I take a chainsaw to your sorry necks and earn myself a place in the humanitarian hall of fame.  For the love of Christ on a fucking stick, please keep your bland, washed out crap out of my town.  IS THAT SO MUCH TO ASK?!  This has been a public service announcement.  Also, THE BARON HAS SPOKEN.
