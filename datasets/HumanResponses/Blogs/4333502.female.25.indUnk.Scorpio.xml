      For some reason, I'm obsessed with monkeys. If anything goes wrong, it's the monkeys. If it's a good thing, Yo ho mon-kays! I don't think I would really like to own one. They seem unsantitary...and a little faggish. Michael Jackson owns them for one. How faggish can you get from that?     I love days like today. They are so dreary and gloomy. There is nothing like curling up with paper, pen, laptop, a good girl movie and just dreaming the day away. Sigh.       However, I have a sinkful of dirty dishes, laundry, dinner to cook and I have a class to go to tonight. It's stressful when all I really want to do is make words and art.   I moved my art space to the upstairs. Hoping to keep the kids out of it. It has helped keep the kids out, but it also keeps me out. Which sucks because I want to go upstairs and art, but I can't seem to make myself take that first step.   I really need a new journal. My fat boy journal is almost full. I love how thick and crammed full of things it is. Sometimes that is what keeps me going, knowing what my journal will look like when it's done. However, I think my next journal will just be a plain compostion notebook. I spent like 30 dollars on the one previous to my fat boy. It was a japanese copic binding, special paper and all that. It really is a piece of art. I love the collages I did in them, I like the fatness of it too, but it's no different from the 9 dollars I spent on my fat boy. So, I'm going to go dirt cheap and see how one in a compositon notebook turns out. I hate lined pages though! I wonder if I could find an unruled composition one.       Fall is coming. I can smell it in the air. I'm very sensitive to smells. My family thinks I'm nuts. I like to smell lots of things...not like my brother! My brother Rob loves to sniff everything. He used to play catch and he would sniff, throw the ball, catch, sniff, repeat process. He is OCD about sniffing. I'm talking about smelling. Smells remind me of lots of things. I always get a bit of fear in my insides when I smell dirt and rain. It reminds me of all those times of hiding from tornadoes as a child. But, there is a wet muddy smell to fall and it's here. I can smell it. I love it. Fall is probably my most favorite time of year. Things are changing and I don't like change...I hate it for a fact, but the sameness, and the annual-ness of fall is what I love. You can depend on it's changing leaves, changing the weather, changing, but always the same time with the same results. I am not a person of chaos. I like for there to be plans and well laid out instructions.   I'm definitely one of those kids in school that would freak out if I didn't know the answers to the test. Or if I missed one question because the instructions weren't very clear.  This is my first entry in a blog. I'll post some pics of my journal soon. Okay, off to clean...something.
