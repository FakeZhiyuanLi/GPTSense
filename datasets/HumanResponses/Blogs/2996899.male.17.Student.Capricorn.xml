      Florida lost in the SEC Championship game.  Duke lost in the ACC Championship game.  One defeats misery is replaced by anothers elation.  The Gators drew a number 5 seed in the NCAA Tourney and have to play Manhattan in the first round.  Whoopty-doo.  We're going to the Sweet 16 this year, I just know it.  We're due.   Duke still sucks and so does St. Josephs.

      Wow.  I am such a sucker.  I now have my own blog to post my daily bitching and moanings.  I can hear them fleeing for the exits now.  A bunch of people went down to Valdosta H.S. today for the region literary meet where we came in second to Tift County.  I competed in the Spelling competition and placed in 4th because the man reading the words was not capable of pronouncing most of them, "turret" being an example.  It wasn't really his fault though because he was a math teacher after all.  Anyways, there is going to be a lot more bitching and moaning if the Gators don't beat the "Pay"Roll Tide tonight in the SEC Tournament.  Oh yeah, Duke blows.

      I'm currently half-way through watching  28 Days Later  and I'd thought I'd share a joke that was said early in the movie after Jim is saved from zombies:  "A man takes a giraffe into a bar and they both begin drinking.  After a while the giraffe passes out and the man goes to leave but the bartender stops him. 'Hey, you can't leave that lyin' here.' 'What are you talking about, he's a giraffe.'"  Anyways, I went out and purchased a few necessary items for my 3 v. 3 basketball tournament tomorrow and decided to purchase the  Kill Bill Volume 2  soundtrack and several of Johnny Cash's cd's along with my movie purchase.    Last Friday and Saturday I saw three movies:  1. Kill Bill Vol. 2 , 2. The Punisher , and 3. The Alamo .  It breaks down like this:  1.  One of Tarantino's best (aren't they all?) and my second favorite next to  Jackie Brown . 2.  Better than  The Hulk  and  Daredevil , but nowhere near  Spider-Man  or  X-Men 1&2 . 3.  A decent movie with its moments.  Oh yeah, Jim Bowie got fucked up by those Mexicans.

      After work today I stopped by Circuit City and picked up  Red Dragon  which officially completes my Hannibal Lecter trilogy.  I also continued expanding my Johnny Depp collection today by purchasing  Donnie Brasco .  It wasn't the one I wanted to get, but CC didn't have  Ed Wood .  But I digress.  I shall retire for now and watch  Donnie Brasco .

      I think every inch on my body is peeling from when I got sun burnt.  Honestly though, there's something intriguing about when the skin peels, I really like looking at it.  Quite amazing.  Well the Friday, the epic  Troy  hits theaters.  Looks like it's gonna be good.  Zak showed me this website today that I can download different DVD box arts from.  Unfortunately, you have pay for each one that you download.  The site is www.dvdboxart.com in case anyone was wondering.

      Well the Indians were on a 4 game winning streak until Peter Gammons had to say something about it on Tuesday night and they then proceeded to get rocked by Boston on Wednesday 9-5.  Tomorrow is the AP U.S. History Test.  That's gonna be a big ole waste of $74.  Yesterday I got sun burnt real fucking bad.  Ow.  I figured out what my movie is going to be about and called, look for  Deicide  coming to a living room near you this summer.  I get to be the preacher in a Mexican wedding for my Spanish 3 class.

      "...Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood."  Interesting weekend.  I got back from Athens on Friday at arond 7:00 and was welcomed with a downpour.  I had leftover Chinese food at Zak's and watched  Sleep With Me .  On Saturday I went on my "date" (quotations are used because it didn't seem like a date because there were four other girls with us) with Brittany.  It was alright, I suppose.  We went to the Sasser Street Dance which just ended up being a hangout with most of the people at Lee County that I hate.  Other than that, the date went alright and Brittany is a nice girl who I'd like to get to know a little better.  But I doubt that will ever happen because two of her friends, Tara Russell (who the hell is that?) and Kayla Deck (a drunk retard who tried to pump gas while smoking a cigarette) hate me and thinks Brittany could do better.  Oh well, too each his (or her) own.  If she wants to pursue a relationship with me, then the ball is in her court.  I took my AP Language test and U.S. History EOCT test today.  The former was expected to be difficult while the latter was not a test, but a mere stupidity exam.
