      once upon a time...ok, maybe i wont tell you the whole story about how i met these two lovely people, but ill give u the main storyline. well i was walking down the street one day with nat and kenny, when we came upon a young lady with square glasses, a missing tooth, and a party hat...well our first impression was that she was a psycho and that we should run the opposite direction as fast as possible, but out of the goodness of our hearts, we asked her if she would like to join us. so she did, and we found out her name was Gertrude. nat suggested that we take a boat ride, and we all agreed to it. we went to the dock and saw only one boat there, and strangely enough, it was a pirate ship! and we all know kenny and nat absolutley love pirates! so we couldnt say no to them. we climbed on board and found the captain of the ship, her name was Agnes. she had a patch over her right eye, a pirates hat on, a hitler mustache, and a peg leg. she told us that we could join her and her crew on their quest to find treasure, so we jumped at the opporotunity! and the rest is pretty much predictable...we sailed on, we were attacked by a giant squid, we crash landed on an island; me, nat, and kenny were rescued by an overpassing plane, and Agnes and Gertrude have been stranded on the island ever since! anyways, this is a picture of them i will always keep close to me, and i wish them luck without any food or supplies on that far away island... urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    ok, well i just got done telling you about ellies problems, but thats not the worst of it all. there is still kailey...yes kailey. she too has a serious illness, maybe even more serious that elley-nor's. she often gets things such as "monkey-migraines" and uncontrollable balve movements...yes, it is all true. she also has this face she does when she says "i told you so"...even though she never says that, lol! and thats what the pic is of. anyways, there is no apparent cure for her either, so i wish u luck with your "monkey-migraine" filled life kailey, and stop making that face and pointing at me...its not nice, and its scary!&nbsp; urlLink

      ok, im sorry to inform u all that your very close friend ellie (aka BEANE) has some serious mental illness that is so serious, she has to go to Sacramento every weekend to get treatment. they say that it is all due to the very tight, blonde curls on her head. im not sure what to say about this, but i thought it was my duty to inform all of you about how serious this really is...thank you for your time, and we wish ellie a safe recovery (which isnt possible by the way)... ;)  urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink

      well im really bored, so ill prolly just go to bed soon, even tho i slept for like 4 hours after school today...lol, im serious! anyways, i was just thinking about how people say that they fall in love in high school, and sometimes even before that, and i was thinking, is that really true? do we as teenagers really know what love is? personally, i feel that u can have a g/f or b/f, sure. but when you do have one, and u think ur in love, is it really love...or is it just infatuation? i guess it really got me thinking because i know of people that say they have been in love and are in love, and im just not sure if they really know what it is. personally the only friends i have that i think are in love are holly and andy, and when i have my first g/f, i want my relationship to be strong like theirs. i mean they've been together for over a year! and i think that's kinda defying the laws of relationships in high school! ;) well, i just thought id ask all of ur guys' opinions. do we really know what love is...what do u think?

       urlLink    hey everyone! today, i decided to take up the subject of belgian waffles...yes u saw correctly, belgian waffles. i chose this topic for this lovely monday evening for no apparent reason. actually, there is somewhat a point to why i want to talk about belgian waffles...but we'll get to that later, right now, i want to give u the definition of a belgian waffle. it is a thick sweet waffle often eaten with ice cream or fruit sauce. (and its a noun for your information) anyways, i guess ill tell you why the hell im talking about belgian waffles...well not too long ago, the morning after kenny (STOCK) spent the night at my house before the day we went with montana to scandia. he guzzled down 5 thick, home-made belgian waffles...yes, 5! i wasnt sure if that was physically possible before it happened, but after it did...i was a believer! yes kenny, i believe now, all thanx to u. and any of you who dont believe, come to me and im sure we can arrange a private session with kenny where he can guzzle down 5 (if not more!) belgian waffles for u. that is all for now, until next time...im out!&nbsp; urlLink

       ive decided that it was about time that i post another one of my post things. im not quite sure what to write about, but i think ill be able to get something out of myself. in my previous post "My Goodbye..." i wrote about a very close friend that will be moving away to Europe by next year. and as much as it will hurt me for her to go, it will hurt me even more by not talking to her probably for a really long time. and i think i have an idea about why she cant contact me in any way, but i dont want to say anything because im not sure if im correct or not. so if she would explain it to me once again, i would greatly appreciate it, and i wont email her anymore if thats what she wants, and if that will make her happy...

       hey, in case u were wondering, which i know u were...JSBPC stands for JAQUE and the BEANE STOCK PODD CEDE. yup, my gang! well since u r so curious as to how it all started, i guess i can tell u! ok, in 8th grade honors english, ellie and i sat next to eachother, and one day i asked her what her middle name was because i knew it started with a B, but i didnt know what it was. so being as she was, she said she hated it and she didnt want to tell me. so i made one up for her, it was BEANE! then our freshmen year in drama, BEANE decided to give me a nickname, i suggested STOCK, but she wanted something different. so she came up with the name PODD, and it stuck with me to this very day. and so it was BEANE-PODD! later that year in drama, we decided to make a worthy addition to our infamous group. so natalie and kenny were added as JAQUE (natalie), and STOCK (kenny)! now we were JAQUE and the BEANE STOCK PODD! then yet another addition was made. BEANE and i were in spanish one day and emily wanted to be added into our gang, and we couldnt resist, i mean she is one CEDE of a girl, therefore, her new name was CEDE! and that is the story (which still continues to the present day) of JAQUE and the BEANE STOCK PODD CEDE!

       sitting here thinking...i tend to do this a lot. i mean, u have to think about life and how its going for u every now and then dont u? well i think u do, and i find it very helpful to my well being. i mostly think about friends and stuff like that. ive had many revalations in my past...but not one was quite like this one. they always come fast and hit me hard, but this one hit really hard. Most of it came to me a while back when i was talking to JAQUE on the phone. a friend...one i love with all my heart, is leaving. and i dont think she knows how much this hurts to write about let alone talk about, and im not sure if ill be able to put all of this into words, but ill certainly try...    Natalia,  one of my best friends in the whole world. the one i always came to with all problems, and someone i would trust with my life. someone i will always love even if if you are over seas, in a completely different continent. you have always been there for me, and even through our very few fights, u always forgave me for being "me". i thank you for all of our talks, whether they were dead serious, or completely stupid and humerous, i loved every one of them. all of our aimless walks to nowhere, i realize now that they werent to nowhere, they were to our friendship. walking with u is something i will cherish until the day i die. u always took in everything i told u and gave back love and care to me. giving me truth, knowledge, and everything u had to give. i owe u my everlasting friendship, and trust me as u will always have it. i dont know if ill ever see u again after u move, but i can garuntee that u will never stop getting emails from me, and when weve all grown older and wiser, ill find u and share everything with u. and if i ever do make it big in the acting world, u can be sure to hear me thanking u when i recive an award, if i ever do. there is so much more to write, say, and express to u in ways i cant explain, but i can say one thing that im sure will sum it all up...i love u natalia as the best friend i will ever have, and i will NEVER forget u...this is my goodbye to u...love forever with all my heart...Nathan    "Good Friend"   I used to think that you were someone else  Then I'd lose my mind each day  I used to think that I could help myself   But it's true what they say  There's no reason without a way   If this is goodbye to you and me  What a good friend youve been to me  and I owe it all to you  every good thing that I do is you   I used to wish that I was someone else  Then I'd dream away the day  Those dreams have made me into someone new   And it's true what they say  There's no better time than today   If this is goodbye to you and me  What a good friend youve been to me  And I owe it all to you every good thing that I do is you   I am here  I need to say  That I will miss you  Every day   And it's true what they say  there's no better time than today   If this is goodbye to you and me  What a good friend you've been to me  If this is goodbye to you and me  Well what good friends we will always be   And I owe it all to you  Every good thing that I do is you  Every good thing that I do is you  It's you  Every good thing that I do is you  It's you  Every good thing that I do  I owe it all to you  Every good thing that I do is you   Song By - 9 Days

       Well today is just another one of "those" days. You know, the days where absolutely nothing is going on in your life and you have nothing whatsoever to do. Yup, I'm having one of those days again! I actually have them a lot. Anyways, I'm writing this because I am WAY ahead in my computers class, and there's only so much typing that you can do in a day, I mean come on! We are gonna be typing for 2 weeks straight, that's just not right! But enough about school crap, who cares? Well I kinda do, but that's besides the point. I still have to have Kenny (aka STOCK) sign my yearbook, so I think I'm gonna let him take it home with him, I just hope he doesn't forget it! Sometimes I'm not sure if everything "upstairs" is working for him. Just one more thing...for Kenny...I think I'll give you his infamous quote..."Huh? What...Huh?". It's all in good fun buddy... ;)

        Anyways, I'm in high school and I've realized...actually, I've learned through experience, that it's all a bunch of drama! I mean, I just finished my freshmen year, and I've already gone through enough drama with friends, and other people, to last me the rest of my high school career! GOD!!!!! Drama needs to just lay off for a while!

       In the beginning there were 5 friends named: Jaque, Beane, Stock, Podd, and Cede, who stuck with eachother through it all...OK I'll cut the crap, lol! I'm Nathan (aka PODD) and this is my page! You'll hear about all kinds of stuff that is goin' on in my life, including all the pointless drama...YEP! So if you don't like it, LEAVE!

      ok, well, first of all i have to say that if you have ever played yahoo towers, it really sucks to be ahead and in the purple zone, and then some wanna-be blue player takes your spot as the dominating player! not to name any names...NATALIE JOAN BELL! anyways, back to my point...shes a cheater and she wants to beat everyone even though she knows i would kick butt any other day. and i have to say that when i get my "umph" back in the game, i wont let her quit until shes back down in the blue zone, hey i might even reach orange! (and i know none of u will prolly know what this all means except for nat and ellie) anywyas, good luck to ellie and myself, and i hope natalie (the cheater) rots in...HELL! lol, j/k! i just hope u LOSE!!!!!

      i am really hungry right now in computer careers, and being bored doesnt help! i dont eat breakfast anymore cause of summer school, and i dont think its a very good idea, cause i accidentally lost 5 pounds in the past 2 weeks! ya, so when i get home, im gonna try to stuff myself to the point of death, lol! nobody try to stop me, this new thing called eating is something i must do to survive, lol. u know, something i could never understand is how people can become anorexic and bulimic. to me that would be physically and mentally impossible! i need to eat, i eat all the time, especially when im bored! seriously though...how is it possible? i love food, who doesnt? ok, if anyone objects to my opinion about loving food, please comment and tell me why you dont like food, cause to me...eating is a hobby! ;)

      ok, i know i havent written in 3 days or so, at least not for the whole weekend. well the reason is...i grounded myself from the internet on my computer at home! yes, i know it sounds crazy, but i got in trouble for a certain reason...not necesarily at home ;) and i dont get to use the internet for 3 more weeks. but i can use it at school, so its all good! anyways, this weekend was really fun! on friday, nat and kenny came to my house to hang out around 6, and we ate pizza...and guess what? kenny only ate 2 pieces! something is seriously wrong! anyways, after pizza, we hung out and jumped on the trampoline. after that we decided to go visit jessica. nat didnt think she was gonna be home at first, but when she answered the door, i rubbed it in nat's face, cause she didnt think she would be home. we talked with jessica for a while, and i beat kenny with a bamboo stick...lol! I DID! we also took some pictures, and after that around like 9:45, we decided to go see "white chicks" at the movies. it was an ok movie, kinda pointless, lol, but it was funny too! after that jessicas mom drove us all home around 12, and i was pooped, so i went to bed. on saturday, i stayed in my pj's all day, i didnt do anything or go anywhere. IT WAS GREAT! then on sunday (the 4th of july) i got together with kenny and nat at the park, and we hung out there for a while with our kool sunglasses...lol, j/k! and we took some pictures and we just had a good time. after that we went to the yokayo pool with kenny and his family, and im the only one who didnt swim, i felt kinda bad about it, but i just wasnt in the swimming mood. it was fun tho, cause we did other stuff. (by the way, kenny, u need a smaller swimsuit!, lol, j/k) anyways, after all that, we went to nats house to watch the fireworks and we took more pics with nats camera, only kenny and nat ruined it...and they know what i mean! lol! we were all gonna spend the night on kennys lawn, but nat couldnt, so me and kenny slept in a tent on his front lawn, it was fun. and in the morning we had belgian waffles! and kenny only ate like 3 or 4...im seriously worried! after that we hung out in his front yard on his driveway in our pj's and we looked like bums! we called nat and we were gonna do something, but nats sister got her in trouble, so we didnt. my dad came and picked me up from kennys, and kenny said he would call and we would try and get nat to do something with us later...but he never did...what a flake! lol, j/k with ya buddy! anyways, that was my weekend, prolly one of the best ones for a really long time!

      well kenny's in florida everyone! he left yesterday morning, and i think someof the stuff that happened sounds like a sign that he shouldnt be going on this cruise at all! first of all, he had to catch a different flight for some reason, and his luggage ended up in new york. and he just got it back at his hotel this afternoon. and to top all of it off, he has to stay inside his hotel today because of a huge hurricaine with over 100 mph winds is going through orlando as i speak! now maybe its just me, but this has all happened in the past 2 days, and they seem like signs as to not continue his trip. but if he likes losing his luggage and 100 mph hurricaines, then he should stay...but kenny...ill pray for u, lol! im J/K, i bet all of that was just incredibly bad...bad luck, and i hope it ends so u can have a great trip! well everyone, i thought id tell u all about kennys trip so far, and ill keep u updated on all the stuff that happens ;)

      well, i think my summer is about done! ive done everything that im going to be doing this summer already, so i dont have much to look forward to but school. and this may sound kinda strange, but im kinda excited about school and all. i mean, i get to see everyone, i get to be in drama 3, and i even get to be sophomore class vice president! i think its gonna be awsome! ill prolly think its kool until we're a week into it all, and then ill be counting down the days until summer again. thats just how i am when it comes to summer and the school year. when its the school year i want it to be the summer, and when its summer i want it to be the school year! confusing and stupid...i know! anyways, i dont know if people are even reading what i write about anymore, cause i dont get any more coments from people. well at least not in the last 3 ive written. nat doesnt write anything anymore, holly wrote a few blogs on her site, and then i think she got bored with it, emily wrote one thing, and i dont think she knows what to do, lol, and kenny doesnt have the internet...or so he says...lol! and ellie is the only one that comments frequently on my site, and she hasnt for the last few blogs ive written. ya, well all of u guys better get with it...CHOP CHOP! lol! its about 10:22 P.M. and i have nothing to do and nothing to talk about. im talking to conner from oregon and thats it. and kenny was supposed to call me back today. but ive kinda given up on believing him when he says he'll call me back...cause he never does, lol! and its kinda getting on my nerves, but theres nothing i can really do about it, and chances are, me writing this is worth nothing cause he wont read it, lol! so i might as wel stop no and go leave him a long random message on his voicemail until it cuts me off cause im really "that" bored. and, dont worry, ill make it annoying! ;)

      hey everyone! i havent written u all in a while, at least not since i headed to tracy last weekend. it's probably been because ive been hanging out with friends a lot in the past couple of days. and id rather be doing that than sitting at home doing nothing, lol. this summer has probably been the best one so far that ive had. not only because ive been hanging out with my friends more and having tons of fun with them, but because ive been building stronger friendships with them as well. and im starting to get the feeling that these friends are the good ones. the ones that i'll be spending most of my high school years with, and the ones that will last...even when we're old and grumpy, we'll be asking eachother to pass the prune juice...lol! ;)
