						   Tis the season to set goals.&nbsp;  Often there is a stimulus in life that causes one to excell beyond one's current abilities.&nbsp; This stimulus is often sought after by companies as those moments can take a company from deaths door to rebirth.&nbsp; The pseudoname of such motivation and stimuli is goals.&nbsp; I often found mself faced with writing up a half a dozen goals for me and my department in whatever company I worked for.&nbsp; These ranged from mundane tasks, like fix such and such problem, to elaborate convoluted tasks, like re-educate everyone on how to do everything.&nbsp; In my first job I was encouraged to stretch myself in my goals.&nbsp; Test my limits.&nbsp; I did often test my limits and succeeded much more often than failed.&nbsp; I succeeded at also getting myself fired.&nbsp; (Open door policies don't include complaining about the lack of a raise for 2 years, just an FYI).&nbsp;   At my next occupation, we were again encouraged to set goals.&nbsp; Then we started reading into the goals program.&nbsp; It seems that if one or one's group was to attain their yearly goal in the first quarter they would get a big 100% for goal completion for that quarter.&nbsp; Unfortunately they would get a big fat 0% on the rest of the quarters.&nbsp; This averaged out to 25% of goal completion.&nbsp; If one or one's group was to slowly attain their goal over the course of the year a 1/4 completion of a project equals 100%.&nbsp; This was such a perplexing problem as the goals they wanted us to set were below the levels of accuracy we had already attained.&nbsp; So instead of creating lofty progressive goals, we created the goals they wanted and created the reports we were going to send for the next year showing a steady improvement.&nbsp;   And now I am to create more goals, goals that are easily attainable but challenging.&nbsp; I thought in life that those two things were mutually exclusive in the outcomes but I guess i was wrong.&nbsp; I begin to wonder if goals are really the great stimulus.&nbsp; There is always the goal of all goals.&nbsp; The mission statement.&nbsp; The goal generating machine.&nbsp; Maybe a mission statement with 3 words can help me focus.&nbsp;   A comment on goals:&nbsp; I once knew a man who was given a job to run a machine.&nbsp; He was also to set a goal for his production output.&nbsp; The machine had a capacity of 600 parts a day and to be on the safe side he set his first years goal to 500.&nbsp; Problems abounded that first year but he managed to eek out 502 parts per day on average.&nbsp; He was then told to stretch himself and set lofty goals.&nbsp; 525 would be his next level.&nbsp; Problems became fewer but still the going was rough.&nbsp; He only attained 523 parts per day barely mssing his goals (and getting none of his bonus).&nbsp; Still he was told to push harder.&nbsp; He was a bit more conservative this time and set a goal for 540.&nbsp; After sacrifice and hard work all year and dealing with even more problems he only got 530.&nbsp; He was ashamed but he couldn't set a goal lower than what he already set.&nbsp; 550 was the next year, 548 was what he got.&nbsp; 555 was the next year, and 556 is what he got.&nbsp; 560 was the next year and 561 was what he got.&nbsp; 565 was the year 7, and 565 was what he got.&nbsp; 568 was year 8, and 568 was what he got.&nbsp; 570 was year 9, and 569 was what he got.&nbsp; 572 was year 10, and 570 was what he got.&nbsp; At the end of the year the company decided to upgrade the machine and within one week had a machine that could pump out close to 1500 parts per day.&nbsp; All their capital investment on the machine totalled quite a bit but they were confident they could get their money's worth very quickly.&nbsp; When the next year ended the average per day of that machine was 650.&nbsp; The owners were furious, they went down to the plant that day to see what the problem was.&nbsp; They were shocked to see the operator get an award, much like employee of the month, and was receiving a double bonus check.&nbsp; When asked what they were doing the managers said that this man had exceeded his goal by over 10%.&nbsp; What was his goal?&nbsp; 575.&nbsp; The next day both the manager and the operator were on the street looking for new jobs.  I'm not saying that goals are a useless activity.&nbsp; Though I am saying that sometimes getting carried away on goals can distract more than add.&nbsp; Where is the line?&nbsp; Who am I to say.&nbsp; I have yet to think of a decent goal for myself.&nbsp; Do you think that 'do a good job' can be quantified?

						   Thinking on the events of the past couple weeks my head begins to reel.&nbsp; I get this job in which the amount of effort I put in should equal the amount of reward I attain, or at least we hope.&nbsp; So in my way I try to attain the most I can get.&nbsp; This means that much of the other stuff in my life is put aside to make way for my attaining this great reward (great in my mind).&nbsp; The only problem I can see with this train of action is that the work load I keep taking on is starting to turn my mind into the most annoyingly green goo.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mass amount of responsibility takes the great knowledge base I have and turns it into incomprehensible mumbo-jumbo.&nbsp;   Why is this?&nbsp; Am I unable to cope with this responsibility?&nbsp; This makes it increasingly difficult to see myself owning a massive corporation and dealing with the high level of decision making required for that role.&nbsp; Maybe, and this is only a stab in the massive void of my current world, it is the fact that one of people I work with has no sense of reality when it comes to describing what they really want out of me, or my assistant.&nbsp; I get these clear pictures of how I would like to see happen, add on that this mess of data which requires restructuring, and then this person whom is training me for some of my duties explaining things in the most abstract and bizarre way that it makes me feel as if I'm being commanded what to do by a 7 year old.&nbsp;   Example:&nbsp; There are gaping holes on this concrete slab where the steel skeleton of our newest building will be melded to the ground.&nbsp; Upon this slab are storage areas for the finished product.&nbsp; The problem with gaping holes is the danger of driving a forklift into such a hole as to put the operator in danger.&nbsp; Aha.&nbsp; Solution, lets buy orange pallets to put over them.&nbsp; This sounds like such a novel and well thought out idea.&nbsp; But these pallets must be heavy-duty plastic and there is a 3 week lead time, and the final cost is close to $2500 for 24 pallets.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our solution?&nbsp; Lets by cheapie pallets ($15 dollars and you can do the math), paint them orange and be done with the headache.&nbsp; His solution?&nbsp; Lets get the woodshop to build barriers with flags and nonsense, paint it orange and affix them to the ground so they can be outside in all types of inclemental weather.&nbsp; What is the cost of such a project, you may ask?&nbsp; (If you haven't asked then please proceed to ask the question now).&nbsp; $3000.&nbsp; Please shoot me in the head.&nbsp; It may take only a couple months to get the building onto the next phase.&nbsp; Why not pay me $3000 to stand out there and wave flags and wear orange when the forklift drivers are moving product.&nbsp;   Now this may not be the best example, but it is the most consistent of the type of environment I deal with.&nbsp; Now you the reader (all 2 of you), are probably baffled at why I can't just reason this out with the man.&nbsp; Good question.&nbsp; One, he will over-react and call a meeting discussing the duties and how we should not undermine his authority (already happened); two, on unwarranted advise he will provide in the future, all of what I am doing will be wrong and his opinion no matter how bizarre will be followed; three, no matter how hard we try a person whose boss is a different state while all of our bosses are in the next building over can do whatever he wants.  That isn't it.&nbsp; It is sufficient enough to make me madder than a fly inbetween the blinds and the window, but it really isn't it.&nbsp; There is so much to do, and so much that I can't even think of exactly where I need to end up.&nbsp; The whole structure in the database for all the material is just baffling.&nbsp; I can't tell a Finished Good from a Sub-Assembly without going to five different screens, and then come to find that someone, who shall remane nameless (psst see above) decided to put two distinctly separate Finshed good products into one BOM and create a whole other Finshed Good that when something goes wrong will always need to be split apart and because it only has room for one of the Serial numbers has to have the other serial number placed in the notes file.&nbsp;   (breathe)&nbsp;   I just need to pace myself.&nbsp; I wanted so bad to be the star of the show.&nbsp; I wanted to take on the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I didn't realize is that they weren't ready for me, or my abilities (or my ego).&nbsp; I'm not really being too boastful on what knowledge I have, because I will equally be as boastful on the knowledge I lack.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just know what I know, and somehow I can't convince the one person who shall remain nameless to just trust me.&nbsp; This person even said on one day that he is eager to turn such and such a project over to me, but turns around the next day and doesn't even have me in the meeting to discuss revisions to the project.&nbsp;   Someone just slap me.

						   Tricia Walker and Davis Raines, two singer/songwriters, came to our college and performed a concert that we produced.&nbsp; We had a chance to sit down with these two in a class setting and ask questions about the music industry and I had asked about the advent&nbsp;or intrusion of the internet on&nbsp;the industry as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;They both agreed that the best way for indie artists to be discovered (i.e. anything not&nbsp;promoted by Clear Channel)&nbsp;is not the internet but word of mouth.&nbsp; Though they are not on my list for those of you that like country or gospel or whatever the style it is that they sing then go ahead and check them out ( urlLink www.bigfrontporch.com ).&nbsp;  &nbsp; So here is my attempt to relay bands of interest in my own word of mouth way.&nbsp;  &nbsp; - Low ( urlLink www.chairkickers.com ) If you check out only one band, check this one out.&nbsp; They are the leaders in a style I call Slowcore, and continue to move it forward in their subtle way.&nbsp; They originate from Duluth and their bare, slow, melodic and haunting sound will take you deep into your emotional center.&nbsp; Check out "Old Man Song", "Point of disgust", "Taking&nbsp;down the Tree", "Whore" and "Those Girls" &nbsp; -Tortoise A listen to this band takes a stretch in patience and an appreciation of minimalism.&nbsp; Though they are influenced by many styles, they still stretch beyond these bases to create a progressive sound that exists only as sound.&nbsp; Check out "Ten-Day Interval", "Djed" and "The Suspension Bridge at Iquaz" &nbsp; -Super Furry Animals Not everything put down into a track is of great value but their style is very influential to today's aspiring artists.&nbsp; Check out "Venus &amp; Serena" and "Hello Sunshine". &nbsp; -Spoon A more Pop/Alternative band that has catchy songs with a practical message.&nbsp; Check out "Fitted Shirt", "Lines in the Suit" and "The Way we Get By". &nbsp; -Spiritualized A band who was featured in a Volkswagon Bug commercial (imagine that).&nbsp; The sound is fascinating as they focus on melody and explore a style that extends into the future of Ambient Pop.&nbsp; Check out "Ladies and Gentlemen we are floating in space", "No God only Religion", "The Power and the Glory", "Lay it Down Slow" and "Stop your Cryin'". &nbsp; -Sigur Ros This Icelandic band has a minimalistic style that takes a long time to fully appreciate, but is worth the time of anyone who can appreciate its pureness.&nbsp; Check out "Svefn-g-Englar" and the entire () album. &nbsp; -Red House Painters I only am in possesion of two of their songs but must recommend them just on hearing these two.&nbsp; Check out "Summer Dress" and "Have you Forgotten". &nbsp; -Polyphonic Spree The lead singer of Tripping Daisy formed this band which seems to embody the celebration of life as well as the various sounds they employ.&nbsp; Check out "Reach for the Sun" and "Fireworks". &nbsp; -Nightwish Hard rock meets Opera.&nbsp; This is a band that most can enjoy with just a little stretch in their musical acceptance.&nbsp; Check out "Over the Hills and Far Away", "10th Man Down", "Wishmaster" and "Away". &nbsp; -Moxy Fruvous Canadian band that conforms to the style that is best loved by the subculture that appreciates BNL&nbsp; Check out "King of Spain", "Boo Time" and "Green Eggs and Ham". &nbsp; -Mercury Rev I do not suggest to check out this band as I find much of their music as sophmoric and reminds me of some of the people I avoided in my high school band because of their mental instability.&nbsp; There is one song that is good though and that is "The Dark is Rising". &nbsp; -Llama Farmers I have only one album of this soft-punk band and would recommend it to anyone that likes The Cure.&nbsp; This style is much more down the line and closer to punk, but the topics they write about are close to what you expect out of a Cure song.&nbsp; Check out "Get the Keys and Go" and "Big Wheels". &nbsp; -Les Savy Fav Another band I have only two songs in my current possession but enjoy each one.&nbsp; More along the style of Spoon.&nbsp; Check out "Who Rocks the Party" and "Hide me From Next February" &nbsp; -Kittie I do not know how underground they are but the hard rocking female group has my attention.&nbsp; Check out "Suck", "Spit", "Charlotte", "Brackish" and a Pink Floyd cover "Run Like Hell" &nbsp; -Joy Division Sounding much like what I would sound if I started a rock band.&nbsp; This band I do not recommend to venture further than the one song I recommend.&nbsp; "Atmosphere". &nbsp; -Hot, Hot Heat A great progressive punk band with catching melodies.&nbsp; Check out "Bandages", "No, Not Now" and "Get in or Get out" &nbsp; -Gorky's Zygotic Mynci This odd music has that quality you just can't describe.&nbsp; I recommend this band to everyone and just say to listen through the song and listen to the lyrics (if they are in English) to appreciate it all.&nbsp; Check out "Frozen Smile", "The Tidal Wave", "Dark Night", "How I Long", "Theme from Gorky 5", "Bola Bola", "Catrin", "Where Does Yer Go Now?" and "2D" &nbsp; -Godspeed You Black Emperor! If I said you need patience on any other band in this list then I have understated that patience.&nbsp; With compositions that extend into the realm of 15 minutes this band changes styles often, and its absence of lyrics does not help in that regard.&nbsp; What they are is a subtly political purely indie band that aspires to not be noticed by the mainstream.&nbsp; They play only for the love of their sound.&nbsp; Check out "A Silver Mount Zion", "The Dead Flag Blues", "Storm" and "Hung over as the Oven in Maida". &nbsp; -Death Cab for Cutie The emotionally charged lyrics and likable melodies make Death Cab a great band.&nbsp; Check out "Styrofoam Plates", "Technicolor Girls", "President of What", "The army Corps of Architects", "Steadier Footing", "Lowell, MA" and&nbsp;"The Employment Pages" &nbsp; -Cat Power For the women out there this band is prefect.&nbsp; Check out "Bathysphere", "Names" and "Good Woman".&nbsp; Also check out the artist Mary Timony. &nbsp; -Blonde Redhead Great band that has a LA rock cafe feel to their sound.&nbsp; Check out "Hated because of Good Qualities", "Mama Cita", "Futurism vs Passeism" and Equally Damaged". &nbsp; -Azure Ray Beautiful Lyrics and woderful melodies from a female artist.&nbsp; Check out "Displaced", "Rise" and "We Exchange Words" &nbsp; -...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead This punk band seems to follow the same style in which their songs subtly change right in the middle.&nbsp; Check out "Mistakes &amp; Regrets", "Another Morning Stoner", "How Near, How Far", "Relative Ways", "Monsoon" and "Flood of Red" &nbsp; Enjoy.

						    1.&nbsp;Own or Run my own company or share ownership in my own company  &nbsp;   If there is one thing that I want more than all else it is this.&nbsp; It will always be at the top of my wish list and if I do accomplish it then will be replaced by the growing of that company.&nbsp; Only by doing this one task will I discover my true self.&nbsp; The extension of my influence on the company will easily be seen in the output and structure both intrinsic and extrinsic.&nbsp; For example, if I care little for the development of the human mind, those that seek to expand their own understanding of the universe will find themselves having to leave while those that wish to drown their mind in the doldrums of life will fill my staff.&nbsp; I guess the purpose of this is just to discover who I am.&nbsp; Its poor judgment to choose a wish that discovers your own nature but I am masochistic.   &nbsp;  2. Visit New Zealand  &nbsp;   My only foreign country that I find fascinating is New Zealand because I believe it embodies a dream I once had of home.&nbsp; Though, as I will admit in a later blog, I am a city boy, my eventual home will be a quiet countryside with a large manor surrounded by mountains and the sea.&nbsp; After exhausting my fill of humanity and Americana I will desire a place that has an indifference to the world.&nbsp; New Zealand, from pictures and literature I have read, seems to have those qualities that would actually provide me a rest from the world.&nbsp; I could be wrong.   &nbsp;  3. Film a movie (or take a major part in it)  &nbsp;   So this could be something that comes to me as soon as next month or may take awhile.&nbsp; I have a need to discover whether I have what it takes to utilize the filming format in order to get across a message.&nbsp; There is no other media outlet that is as influential as film and if I really have the passion I believe I contain then the only way to show this is through a powerful film.&nbsp; This part of my wish list actually is just to introduce me to the process.   &nbsp;  4. Go to a Classical Concert  &nbsp;   This is the first on my list that only exists in the next 12 month period.&nbsp; I do not think that I will be limited to one concert in my lifetime, but it has been a considerable amount of time since I did enjoy&nbsp;a beautiful masterpiece performed live.&nbsp; I think my ears deserve to be treated to such a treat soon.   &nbsp;  5. See a Progressive Band Live (i.e. Low, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, Trail of Dead)  &nbsp;   Lately I have been discovering Indie artists by the handfuls.&nbsp; I first discovered Low about 3 years ago and have yet to hear their gorgeous music live.&nbsp; More recently the fascinating band of Gorky's Zygotic Mynci or the perfectly composed punk group of ...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead.&nbsp; It is so rare that these bands make their way to Salt Lake City and more rare that I hear about them in time to see them.&nbsp; So this year I hope to accomplish that.&nbsp;

						   My wife told me that if I ever was caught and was replaced by someone they could easily fool her if they just repeated Simpson quotes all day long.&nbsp; In my defense I&nbsp;must state&nbsp;that I don't have an addiction to the Simpsons but have a way of applying so many situations to a particular quote.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much like my friends seem to find a way of inserting South Park quotes (1st and 2nd seasons) into way too many situations, I too look for a way to express myself humorously with applicable quotes.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  What is the fascination with these timeless quotes?&nbsp; As a connoisseur of cinema I find so many lines that express myself much more completely than I could find in my own head.&nbsp; I try really hard to not be influenced by the large amount of media that I have engorged in my life.&nbsp; Yet as a silent type in nature (not in practice) I stumble over phrases and have a hard time conveying perfect meaning when I speak, so why not steal?&nbsp; Someone somewhere said something perfect and who am I to not recognize their genius and repeat that so others can understand.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The fascination exists because even though on film or in a book someone says something perfect, I realize there is some bumbling&nbsp;person behind the script that, like me, is just finding an outlet for what they really mean.&nbsp; If someone finds themselves quoting me then I, like that bumbling genius, will be complete.&nbsp; My thoughts will be repeated by others and I will realize that I am not alone in my feelings.

						   The previous list was suggested by one of my business teachers as a way to provide the 'universe' with a numerous amount of possibilities that it could bless you with.&nbsp; He stated (as I rephrase what was stated in a previous blog) that too many people limit themselves to one or two wants or goals and the universe can't always accommodate because the possibility from now is to remote for that occurrence to happen, like wishing to win the lottery.&nbsp; He went on to say that by giving a list of wishes and wants, not limited by current finances or states, the universe could possibly provide one or two.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; It took me over a week and a half to write that horrific list.&nbsp;&nbsp; This should be an easy list filled with exotic locations, 'toys' and bright futures that&nbsp;number or exceed the required amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have been proud of what my mind can imagine in my future or excited&nbsp;at the prospect that just one of these things could&nbsp;happen to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the list took a long time and the outcome was less than what I expected.&nbsp; I want very few toys, in fact most toys disgust me with their wasteful nature and their time just to maintain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exotic locations are not my cup 'o tea as travel&nbsp;is more of a punishment instead of a relaxing event.&nbsp; The future I see for myself&nbsp;can only be accomplished through&nbsp;few means and once I have obtained these means I want very little beyond that.&nbsp; Its the attaining of this position that is the accomplishment&nbsp;in my life and which would give it purpose.&nbsp; It would provide for all the other wants of my family and future wants of my children, but I would rather spend my life&nbsp;with very little in terms of possessions and more with comfort.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; What in fact I learned about myself is that I have already restricted myself.&nbsp; Practicalism and pessimism have replaced the wide eyed hope&nbsp;and ignorance of my youth.&nbsp;&nbsp;My life of potential is limited by my realization of what life really is.&nbsp; If only I could believe that the person with the most toys at the end wins or that my existence depends on the approval of my peers.&nbsp; If only I was searching for a hobby to waste my time with or find solace in the wisdom of others.&nbsp; If only I could believe that life would last forever or that my perspective will change the world.&nbsp; These things are so passé and some are as possible as being struck by lightning.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not go into what life is but you can assume that I think that the above is not it. &nbsp;  &nbsp; Still, there should be no reason that a list of 60 things should take more than a couple hours of deep contemplation and to my dismay so many of them depend on my own sacrifice.&nbsp; Graduation, owning my own business, learning this or that, writing a book or script or losing weight requires so much of me.&nbsp; Maybe that is it.&nbsp; I have actually created a void in which my mind wants me to do something that my body has yet to do.&nbsp; Maybe that void is what I should focus on, create my own motivation.&nbsp; If the separation of what I want to have accomplished and what I have already done is great I will finally break my funk once and for all.&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; So where should I start...

						   This journey we have taken this past 6 and one half months will ne’er be forgotten.  For thou hast been a a faithful companion through thick and, well thick.  Twas only a few months ago when a writing utensil could get caught in your tangles and you were able to be braided for the first time.  If only thou wouldst be able to grow longer and longer, thou wouldst touch my toes.  But dark is the coming doom, with razor sharp…razors.  In the prime of life you will be hewn down and cast forth to fiery region of the trash can.  There will be mourning and many will wonder at thy disappearance.  And yet in the end thy death will serve a higher purpose of impressing a potential employer by the clean shavedness of the stubble.   No words can express how I will miss thee, no power will bring you back, save nature and time.  Thy name shall ever go down in history, oh blessed 5” goatee.  You neck tickling shall not be forgotten.  If ever a nation should mourn, if ever grief should be felt, it is now, or when I get around to going to actually performing the deed which may not be until tomorrow.  So let us mourn and grieve starting today or perhaps tomorrow, for our tears will spring forth and provide new hope.  A hope of a world that is not ashamed of 5” goatees, a world that embraces them with open arms (or open fingers).  Let us rejoice when that day shall come, for its coming is nigh and the destroyer of facial hair shall be no more.  But let it exist, if only to get rid of the hair under the chin that is annoying, as well as the hair on the lower cheeks that looks tacky, as well as the mis-sized mustache for my face and also the to trim the sideburns back.    Fare thee well old friend.

						   I abhor the sounds of country music and my soul dies a little each time I hear that awful twangy sound in my ears.  In fact country music is only a few notches above the most foul music, that being rap and the song about Laci Peterson (www.modbee.com/images/sections/rememberinglaci.html) as the reaching a level of putricidness (because no word can describe how bad they are).  I find the idea that rock and country had the same roots to be rather ludicrous but then again I'm not a scholar on modern music styles.  Onto my favorite drink.  When I was young I used to sneak out of the house late a night and wander down to the community clubhouse and with my saved up milk money would buy a Dr. Pepper.  I have never liked carbonation that much, except when it came to the sweet, sweet nectar that is Dr. Pepper.  Because of this addiction I decided to go off of it for a couple years and was completely successful.  I have recently started to drink it again on occasion.  (Sounds like I'm a recovering alcoholic don't it?).    What I can't figure out is what demographic are they advertising to by having Garth Brooks, Reba McEntire(sp) and Leann Rhymes(sp)?  Young and middle aged hicks?  Truckers?  What happened to my generation?  The only people I know that drink Dr. Pepper listen to hard rock music or anything but country (of course my circle of acquaintances who listen to country music is rather small).  I just don't get it.  And then in this forsaken area, there is a billboard with Reba and LeAnn promoting it some more.    Maybe I'm just not the right demographic for their product.  I wonder who Mr. Pibb is advertising for.

						   We, my wife and I, have recently come under the acquaintance of a couple through similar hobbies and interests.  It happened that tonight we were collected together with a few of our other friends and my wife had an opportunity to get to know the wife.  In the process she discovered that she was working and the husband was staying at home to tend to their 11 month old child.  Without being to intrusive with her questioning my wife found out about their previous situation which had them both working impossible hours at back breaking jobs, but the wife found this job.  Later while driving home I asked my wife what she found out about their plans for the future, which happened to be nothing.    Lately there has been a lot of evaluation on our current position and what we are trying to accomplish, especially with the recent advent of 2 kids and a loss of my job.  Not surprising is the fact that I am back in school and pursuing both a MBA and a CPA in order to give myself a valuable station in society.  But why?  What is the purpose of expending money (blessed tax-payer money) and time instead of trying to find a decent corporate ladder to climb?  When I get around to finishing my list of wishes, the first thing is to run my own company.  Is going to school accomplishing this? Nearly 50% of companies are owned by people without a degree and those with degrees rarely possess a MBA or a degree in Business.  So what is the purpose of my going to school in this field?    The other part to the question is what will I get when I'm done.  A doctor can guarantee a minimum income, at least until their reputations are built.  A engineer of any type can predict a certain amount and also can see the extent of their field.  Other degrees are less and less more assured, but none are as bland and unpredictable as a business major.  With the seemingly sole goal of all corporate America to pay the least for the most, the degree is in direct conflict with the acquisition of large wealth.  In two articles I just read in Business Week I can see that MBA's are valued less and companies run by Harvard MBAs have almost in every case gone down, either less revenue, filed for bankruptcy, or disappeared from the map.  It is scary to base an education on an unpredictable and unsuccessful formula.   So with my purpose being stripped from me I find myself at a crossroads I was totally unprepared to handle at this time.  I am now registered for 15 credits in the fall and currently taking 9 this summer.  School is paid for already (government assistance is a blessed gift) but time is against me.  Am I really gaining a valuable understanding of business structures and processes in this institution?  I have been applying for swing shift jobs and have passed up much more profitable jobs because of this.  With 35,000 I can survive and support my family well and with the incentive to always make more as well as a plethora of real world experience I could easily accelerate my income and even find a way to be the rich bastard I always wished I was.  And yet 2 years from now I could graduate and be given a residency at some accounting firm for 10 bucks an hour (works out to over 20,000 a year) forcing my wife to still be working.  Then after 2 years I can qualify for the CPA (while getting my MBA at night) and for what?  A job of maybe 40 to 50K to build up more real world experience.  And then maybe end up in the same place as the other path.  My choice has been made before I even came to this fork in the road of life (see previous blog).  I can't keep from just being distracted by the possibility of being highly educated and poor just for the sake of having chosen the wrong profession.  There are plenty of these people in the world, and some of them are teaching me about the business world right now, teaching me how to make money.    This brings me back to the couple at the beginning.  Is it so bad that they probably don't have a plan for the future or an idea of how to improve on their current situation?  They could be the next Warren Buffet or Sam Walton sitting across from me just waiting for the right opportunity to strike their talents on the world of finance.  They also could be just finding a way to survive till the next paycheck.  But how many of us, even with aspirations of financial glory, are just living until the next paycheck.  Hoping that the heavens keep sending protective blessings down so we can survive until the day we die.  I guess in the end, I won't be surprised if I end up living in the same retirement community as this couple and the only difference is a few plaques on the wall with the signature of some dean on them.

						   I have a teacher this semester who I happened to catch after class and chat a little with.  After a short discussion on many issues he gave me a directive to write down 60 things I would like to accomplish if money, time, and other factors were not an issue.  He went on to say that if we put these things down the universe will help make it happen.  The problem is that we need to give the universe plenty of options to choose from, because if we limit our options the less likely things can fall into place to make it happen.  I have started this list despite the argument I am going to make now.  Is life a limitless array of possibilities?  With the birth of our newest child and the rapid development of our not-quite 2 year old I can see the limitations and opportunities each has based on genetics and on the environment we have provided to raise them.  Our 2 year old has been in and out of daycare because of my limitations on bringing in a substantial income.  The daycare has been an interesting experience for him and I can tell that he enjoys it very much.  What is interesting about the whole experience is that he doesn't seem to relate well with the other kids (a trait picked up from his parents) but likes the extra activities.  Does that mean that our son will never be a wonderfully charismatic leader of men?  Isn't his inability to relate and play with other kids a limit to his future?   When we look back often times we can see a direct path of choices that lead to our current position.  Labelled as Quantum physics by our wonderful Star Trek TNG, the idea that every situation can produce a infinite amount of outcomes based on a single choice.  But I often wonder how many choices we actually make.  I chose to start writting and right now I have to go to the bathroom.  Do I stop or am I afraid to loose my point that I'm making.  I already made my choice when I started.  There wasn't a second choice.  In life there are few second choices.  There are easily defined crossroads, you weigh your options and you go with it, but once your on a certain path, most of the choices are made subconsciously.  The only way to change that path at a midpoint is to affect the subconscious mind first.  This brings me back to the list.  It really isn't the universe that makes things happen in my opinion, though lucky things do happen quite often.  It is our subconscious mind.  The wealth of knowledge your person database known as your brain holds produces the luck, produces the opportunity.  This teacher of mine related a story of how he wrote down one year that he wanted to go to Alaska without paying for it.  Later on in the year a friend of his called him up and told him of this guy in Alaska that wanted him to come up and evaluate his business plan, expenses paid.  I'm not going to assume anything, but isn't it possible that a conversation he had was stuck in the back of his mind and he wrote this wish down because of a conversation or a memory of something that led to what really happened.  I believe so.    On the other hand.  When I write something down I'm trying to reprogram my subconscious.  I'm telling it to change paths or create a new path altogether.  The human mind is a fertile soil of opportunity.  So even though in making the list I may put something down that I know (or believe) is already in action outside of my control, I still realize that if I don't write it down I may not be on the correct path when that fortunate luck comes my way.

						   Here is a review of a book I heard on tape recently.  The book is called Jackdaws by Ken Follet  Rating 3 of 5 This book had a good beginning. An intense start and a back and forth manner that made it interesting to read (though annoying at times). I almost was at the point of comprising a good script on the idea and that the story could easily be adapted to a screenplay. And that was it. The middle is very borish and insulting to any fan of WWII as well as society at that time. Follett had a good beginning and a good ending but could not connect the dots inbetween to make a complete book. I found myself less interested in the characters the more they drifted into preachy and predictable roles. The insults to decent society as well as 'modern' thinking pushed down onto mid 20th century women is just a pathetic attempt to capture a 'broader' audience for the book. I am not ignorant to the type of things that existed in the 40's that we are still grappling with today, but to try and encapsulate all of those stereotypes on the 10 to 15 odd characters in the text is just inane. What is funny is that this part of the text is not shocking or revealing to the modern reader and half of these reviewers that i have read passed over those idiotic sections without a flutter of the eye. So the whole point of putting those things in there and making political comments on the downtrodden minorities in society goes over the heads of the intended audience.   I know I am in a minority here when I wish that texts on historical times would come off like a good Bogart movie in which the illicit actions of the characters and the sexual tendencies were just refered to instead of graphically written out. If I wanted to read about those types of things there is a whole section of writting devoted to that. What I want is a good story and have it paced well so I'm not stuck mulling through pages of fluff. Authors of such liberal mindedness (not putting down liberal ideals) should realize that parading their ideals in full in each ream of text they produce only dilutes the effectiveness and in the end takes away from the whole. In this text we should feel strongly about how powerful a female element is in all aspects of society including war. We should identify with the heroine and open our minds towards the capacity women have in our current society. Instead we have to take in such topics as transvestites and lesbianism and extra-marital affairs and fighting for what you believe even if it is nazism. In the conclusion of finishing the book I identify more with the simpleton nazi gestapo leader who is trying to perform his duty more than any others. I'd rather hear more on his attempts and failures to accomplish his goals and why that happens then on talks of beauty and how a woman looks under this or that dress and whether I should feel for the Nazi's jewish mistress.   On the plus side I enjoyed the story and would appreciate more discussions and tales from females role in WWII. The beginning and ending were good as well as the cat and mouse session in the middle. All components made for a memorable story, minus what i mentioned above.

						   It is interesting to me to work at the companies around here in Utah, and in each place the people are being worked to the bone and all their talents expended for a few measly dollats an hour.  For example, in my first job I rose quickly to a position and a certain level where I could notice what was actually going on at each level in the company.  But the factory floor had people who had devoted more than ten years of effort and wered payed almost the same as new hires or only $1.00 to $1.50 an hour more.  I was upset later on when one of these people was passed up for promotion even though his work record was spectacular only because he didn't have a complete handling of the English Language.  Not that this Peruvian was hard to talk to as I found myself on many occasions able to communicate with him perfectly.  Discrimination of a minority that does not fight back is still unjust.  Yet I remain a heartless businessman willing in my mind to take on whatever corporation lies in my way to success.  Does that mean that I want to treat my employees like they are only worth the minimum wage I pay them, but they better give me double or triple that in effort?  There was an editorial in the school newspaper about a students frustrations on driving in this forsaken valley.  After griping about a near miss incident with a local driver she says " In Utah we live in a society where we are taught to be selfless people but have drivers who act rather selfish!".  If that was the only thing Utahns were selfish on then I would be happy.  I think that when these business owners out here strive to the top through all the adversity (which is very little) and all the problems (which admittedly are rather large) they think that they deserve everything that their corporation makes.  Instead of finding ways to reward dilligent effort and ingenuity among the employees of their companies they reap all the rewards and share little.    In my first job here in the valley I was offered stock options after 2 years of 100 options every year for 3 years and I couldn't exercise them until the 5th year.  What was pathetic about the options is that the company never really loses or gave the employees anything.  9 times out of 10 the people don't or can't exercise because they are no longer with the company or the market is bad or its just not worth it to go through the hassle.  Then when you do exercise you have to do a sort of a trade and you eventually end up with the amount of stock you can buy between the amount they offered it to you and the going rate.  When this happened I took 300 bucks and bought some stock at the market value.  After I got fired from the company after 5 years I had zero from the stock options (because the market was bad) and about $220 from what I bought.  Now its worth about $500, but so what?  Why couldn't they fes up 50 shares of stock each?  Because they just were trying to put another carrot out in front, trying to get us to give them our lives and our sweat for another season of our lives without giving decent pay for it.    Business owners around here, and generalizing is so fun, are the most selfish, uncaring, undeserved people on the planet.  They exploit whoever they can, demand as much as one can give, pay them 10 bucks an hour and then fire them as soon as they don't perform at a high level or break one of their millions of rules.  I know of a company that earned over 10 million dollars in the bank in about 3 years, turned around and spent it on a business acquisition that everyone thought was stupid (including some high level managers that had been to the place) and ended up losing about 3 million dollars on top of that trying to turn the place around and 'make it profitable'.  Then they come out in the company news letters with a 'C'est la vie' attitude while their employees are collecting food stamps just to stay alive.    Who at the top looks down at their vast earnings and turns a blind eye to those that earned it for them?  Who are these bastards that can't look beyond the balance sheet or their gross margin to see who put the numbers there?  I am still a shrewd businessman at heart and plan on getting what I believe I deserve out of life.  I will fight forever for free markets and less restrictions on businesses in general.  But I won't tolerate there to be a pay difference of well over double between a man and his supervisor, or that supervisor and the Manager or that manager and the VP or that VP and the Executive.  I don't mind getting a big bonus for performing wonderfully, but that bonus better be shared with every person in the factory that went the extra mile.    Managers can convince themselves forever that their objective is to pay the least for the most.  They can convince themselves that employees are happy with what they are being paid.  They can convince themselves that there are 'other' incentives more valuable than money to an employee that can bridge the gap from what they should be paid to what they are paid.  Yet, they will always be surprised when productivity goes down.  They will always fret when the newest factory in town steals half their quality employees for just a dollar more in pay.  They will always wonder why so many people knock on their door for raises instead of being happy with the wonderful company party or bonus package or dental plan.    A major clothing retailer (their name shall remain anonymous but I'm sure other retailers are the same) decided to centralize most of its functions to save money.  They consolidated the HR functions as one of their initiatives.  This means that whenever you have a complaint or question you have to call some hotline (automated of course) where you complain into an answering maching or go online where hopefully your question can be answered with the FAQ.  What was sad is that we couldn't go to our local HR director and get any answer.  All they did was punch in the hours and knew as much as we knew about what was the latest benefit or when do we qualify.  When I filled out my W2 I had to digitally sign it online.  When I had to apply for benefits I had to go online and digitally sign a form.  Then the real kicker.  I had to resign on line when I was done with the job.  Print out a copy of that resignation and sign it for real.  They didn't care if it was me or Billy Bob the janitor getting benefits but when it came to legal liability on whether I was there or not you better believe they had me sign a piece of paper.  Afterwards I had to get some employement verification.  I called the company and the 'HR director' said that he couldn't give out that info.  In fact he could get fired for giving out information on employement because the company had a better way.  A way that generated money.  It happened to be a 1-900 number that the company could call to verify, or a online registration fee they could pay (which extended up into the hundreds of dollars for multiple use).    This HR system was a service provided by another company that many (and I mean many) companies were signing on for.  It all seems really smart and cheap, until you start to think of what the HR branch of a company was designed to do.  It was to be a RESOURCE for the HUMANS that work for the company.  It is a very personal aspect of the company.  The college major of Business HR is loaded with psychology and sociology classes.  They spend a lot of time understanding humans and their motivations.  Yet a large company who wants to save some money so that the newest CEO can enjoy a large bonus at the end of his 5 year stint decides to use a computer to handle this.  Its all logical, just inane.  Don't worry though your company is next.  When you want to sit down and talk about how your being sexually harrassed, I'm sure the kiosk will make you feel so much better.  This is a promise to all the world that when I own my company or make decisions about the company I will find out what each person makes and fight to give them something more, up to what they deserve for their effort.  I will make an environment that is fair and provides a place that makes my employees feel proud of their own work.  Will I follow through on this promise?  When those numbers from the accounting department cross my desk will I fret what the Board thinks or what the EPS is?  Or if I'm not a public company will I think of how I can acquire more money quicker?    Finally a warning.  Don't let the business owners and leaders in society tell you that money isn't everything.  It doesn't matter if its not everything to them.  When you have money, money means very little.  Make sure they understand that money is important to you first.  That can buy benefits, that can buy a future for you and your family.  Then you can start working on the other things that make your life happier.

						    Today I was interested in comments on IMDB (Internet Movie Database) concerning Fahrenheit 9/11.  The question was asked what you will do if George Bush wins.  I got halfway down the inane chatter when I finally decided to post this:   Here is an honest response. I will sit at home watch the TV, feel some emotion on the order of a stomach cramp and eventually go to bed and wonder if there is any point in it all. The Bush camp has my vote, though I believe this partisan political posturing will eventually tear apart the nation. If Bush wins the Reps will just go on being more Reps and less Dems and if Kerry wins the Dems will gloat and become more Dems and less Reps until the nation sits divided. Everyone will sit back and look at the past and wonder why Lincoln was so able to unite differing factions and think on his words about a house being divided can not stand. And as we look back we fail to see the ignorance of our ways. We allow our emotional nature to get the best of us. We believe without questioning, we question without reason, we reason without purpose. Instead of holding to the principles that created this nation we will change those princples and instead of resolving issues we will avoid.   Government is a warm blanket on a hot night. It provides only symbolic comfort. When we can trust ourselves and govern our natures, only then can we rid ourselves of it. Until then, we allow the beast to control our lives. We spend money on policies we neither understand nor have power to change. We allow individuals to wield the mighty sword and then question their every move. We are hypocrits and worse, we are ignorant.   If you want political commentary you go to hollywood. I'm sure that all of their Political Science, Economics and other degrees make them the best candidates to dictate to the masses what we believe. Hollywood (as it exists in political form) represents our inability to govern our own natures. It indulges in the carnal and tells us to accept and conform. It tells us to question all things societal, political, physical and supernatural except one vital thing, and that is what it tells us. Instead of being an Art, film is now a master, a puppeteer to every mind.   But I digress, we are talking about Bush and Kerry. 2 men. Did you know that Kerry believes in God? Its interesting that someone here questioned the idea that Bush believes he is appointed by God. Would not Kerry believe the same if and when he became president? Catholicism does believe in the appointment of its leaders as well as world leaders (accept this at face value or question it, it makes no difference).   Please don't be ignorant of the results on the election Bush is guaranteed 42% and so is Kerry. Its the law of averages and the record of voting for the past 20 years that determines this. No matter what it is a close race and that contestant that chooses all the best political stances will win.   My only hope is that everyone forgets to be politically minded. What happened to the day of rapturous speakers and influential talk that elected a president? Is it so much different then posturing and careful selection of topics and points in debates that we do now? At least with a great public speaker we could have elaborate and influential quotes to look back on in history books. Bush/Kerry. Those two are twins in the whole scheme. Government is a monster that will continue to grow and rob us of our agency until we rebel and overthrow. This inevitability was predicted from the beginning. The population either conforms to government wishes or fights against it in a futile manner because they choose the wrong issue. They choose the issues that have the least negative effect on them (pollution, rain forests, conspiracy theories, coverups, Mismanagement of funds, abortion, amendments, wars). Why not focus on Entitlements? What about a million man/woman march about that? Most of your taxes go there. Are you afraid that when you grow old and have failed to plan, or are a victim of a volatile market, or lose a leg in a war that the government won't be there to bail you out? I see.   Wait, did I get distracted again. That is why I call you fools. You put your vote behind one or the other condidate and don't even realize that your vote is futile, because your utopia of society cannot be reached, even if all the programs go into place and everything is changed to suit your individuality. Stupid individuals. I suggest you pick up a book on Anazasi(sp) Indians compared with Anglo/european society. We are unable to work in a synergistic cooperation, we pride individual achievment. At the same time we choose to support more 'noble' and 'liberalistic' causes in order to be humanitarians. Pluralism exists in this one concept that creates the source of our dischord.   And I got distracted again. Personally I hope that there is another hanging chad incident and it drags on for months and months. I hope the end of this charade comes soon or some reason is injected into society quickly. But, thanks to liberal unobjective media we won't even care in the end.   Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion. -Kitty Farmer, Donnie Darko (2001)   Unfortunately this isn't a good representation of how I feel.  In fact, it isn't how I believe at all.  Incite, wait, pounce, Incite, wait, pounce.  The ever interesting dance of communication.

						   One can only assume that a sudden spark of genius causes action.  I believe that a significant action is caused by a multitude of choices that leads you through a complex path to that action.  Whether or not starting a Blog is a significant action is debatable.  Yet I find the prospects of blabbing on and on about this or that so intriguing, intriguing enough to attempt such a action.  I have posted on many message boards on many topics and find that people do not respond to me.  My reasoning is either to profound (another word for idiotic) or my choice of topics to bland to cause another human being to be interested.  I often wonder if that is part of the reason I am having trouble acquiring a job at this point in my life.  My resume is loaded with many accomplishments, akills and potential that I can see employers turning away from it just for the fact that they would have to pay me.  Yet I'm applying for jobs that are "do nothing, get nothing" positions.  Oh well.  About me?  Well most blogs start off with a description of one's life, ones passion's, one's likes or dislikes, one's hobbies or fetishes, one's physical description or one's beliefs.  Those are fantastically important subjects, except to me.  So therefore I find myself in this realm of existence to become the blog itself.  I'm nothing, I exist as nothing.  Until the next word is typed out to be posted there is nothing about me.  You can imagine me anyway you like.  I won't post a picture (I hope to never have to) and I won't pretend to be something I'm not.    My goal in this is to post something everyday, beginning today.  Because of the lateness of the hour in which I am posting I wil be copying a response to a question.  I apologize to anyone unfortunate enough to find interest in what I post and hope that the boredom you find here serves some purpose (i.e. to help you cure insomnia).
