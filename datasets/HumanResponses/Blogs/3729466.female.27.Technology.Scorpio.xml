      é dando............................. que se engravida. Quem ri por último................... é retardado. Alegria de pobre................ é impossível. Quem com ferro fere................ não sabe como dói. Sol e chuva,................. vou sair de guarda-chuva. Em casa de ferreiro................. só tem ferro. Devo, não pago... nego enquanto puder. Quem tem boca vai................ ao dentista. Gato escaldado ........................ morre. Quem espera,........................ sempre cansa. Quando um não quer.... o outro insiste. Os últimos.................... serão desclassificados. Carro a álcool,........... você ainda vai empurrar um. Há males............................ que vem para pior. Se Maomé não vai à montanha,....... então vai à praia. A esperança e a sogra...... são as últimas que morrem. Quem dá aos pobres,.......... paga a conta ! do motel. Depois da tempestade.............. vem a gripe. Devagar............................. nunca se chega. Antes tarde........................do que mais tarde. Em terra de cego.. quem tem um olho é caolho. Quem cedo madruga.......fica com sono o dia inteiro.

      Aquele que, ao longo de todo o dia: É ativo como uma abelha; Forte como um touro; Trabalha que nem um cavalo; E que ao fim da tarde se sente cansado que nem um cão.  Deveria consultar um veterinário.  É bem provável que seja um burro!

						   Oh yeah, I am still with that man. Each day goes by I want him more. He is married, but he is separated just like me. This weekend was a short weekend for us because he didn't stay with me Saturday night and Sunday all day. He came to my place around 5 pm on Sunday. Then he laid down on the sofa and stayed there most of the time while I was doing some school work. We watched 2 movies I went to get him at blockbuster, ate dinner and went to bed around midnight. I never go to bed early when he is there. He stays awake late every night. I can't go to sleep because he has that TV on volume high. Men....they are all the same...but I can't live without them...I love men! I love my man!  Anyway, not much to say. One thing he did yesterday that I didn't like, but it is my fault, is that he logged in into his messenger and one of his girlfriends was online with a message, "Visit my website!". Curious like he is, he clicked on it and there it was, this girl's website with her pictures like a model, a trying-to-be-porn-model. Then I was telling him that he likes her and that he tells her she is beautiful...and he told me that was not true...and we almost got on an argument...I am so stupid. That was my moment to tell him to go home and use his computer to see that type of crap. But because I am better than this shit, I decided to shut my mouth and go to sleep. His time will come. My chance to be through with him will come. I am sure. I am patient. I am going no where. He can't go anywhere. I am getting stronger and learning each day.  Let me get back to work...

						   Today I feel much better. Praying does help.   I have been thinking more about my life. I have been analyzing all I have gone through with my friend and my boyfriend and I believe I have learned a big lesson. I have learned that keeping my mouth shut is the best thing I can do. Being quiet will bring me to success. Being quiet will make my life better. This blog is helping me to succeed in keeping my mouth shut. I am not telling people I know about my life; I am telling to a diary, a diary that doesn't know me. So, whomever reads this won't really bother me because I don't know the person nor the person knows me.  Anyway, it is Friday and the weekend is here. I have a bunch of work to do this weekend. I am taking Summer classes and it sucks! Time is too short and I can't get most of my work done! But after I graduate in December, things will be much better! I can't wait.

						    Day by Day...   Day by day, dear Lord of you Three things I pray: To see you more clearly, To love you more dearly, To follow you more nearly, Day by day.     Father Mychal's Prayer   Lord, take me where You want me to go; Let me meet who You want me to meet; Tell me what You want me to say, and Keep me out of Your way.

						   Three things are of the evil one: An evil eye; An evil tongue; An evil mind. Three things are of God, and these three are what Mary told her Son, for she heard them in heaven: The merciful word, The singing word, And the good word. May the power of these three holy things be on all men and women of Erin for evermore.

						   I have learned a big lesson in my life after this situation I got into. Friends are not always your friend. After sharing so much of my personal life with a girl that was supposed to be my friend, I came to a conclusion that she was really not my friend. When I told her about my relationship with this married man, she told me that was not right. I didn't disagree with her but I didn't stop what I was doing. I was still seeing this man. She was always listening to me talking about this guy and being kind and friendly. So, I thought I could count on her by telling her who he was. It was my mistake for telling her about my situation because this guy, who I will call BS from now on, told me to not tell anyone about our case. He is supposed to be a good guy, a family man. Well, I had promised him not to say anything to no one. Well, that was not so, I told my girlfriend about him and she didn't like to know who was because she knows him and his family because they are from the same town. I should have known better to not tell her about us. Shoot! Now she knows and I could be f***** up.  Too late now. I went on telling her about my relationship with BS and she was just listening. But when I felt like I was being left out, she would tell me that BS is not for me and that I should encourage him to go back to his wife and kid. Yeah I know that but what she didn't care is that I love him and didn't want him to go. She was always telling me that he would regret and that it happened to her daddy and that nowadays her daddy regrets all he did. Her father was seeing another woman while still married to her mother and her mother was pregnant at the same time this other woman was. So, my friend see that I am going through the same situation and that I will regret. She sees me as a woman destroying a family. Now you see what a friend she is. She told me that I was destroying a home and that it is not right. I didn't destroy anything. It was his decision to leave his house, not mine. It was his decision to separate his wife, not mine. Yeah, I should leave him alone and encourage him to go back home, but he said he is not going because he doesn't love his wife anymore and the only reason he would go back is his daughter. I know he loves me and I love him too...but now I don't know what to do...  My supposedly to be friend is not talking to me anymore because she told me I am doing wrong and that she doesn't like that and that her other friends don't do things I do. Well, like I said before, she feels like she is Ms. Perfect. She doesn't lie. She doesn't do anything wrong. Bull crap! She does all the lying and wrong indeed. She just try not to repeat them by correcting them. Well, I am not correcting my doings because I believe there is no correcting the past. I believe there is doing better now and today. I will try not to keep repeating them. Plus, it is my life. All I wanted from her was her opinion and friendship about my situation, but she felt the right to do whatever because she said I brought her into my business and this gives her rights to take an action. The action she was going to take was to call BS and tell him all that she knows. Now I ask you: What does she has to do with that? I told her it was not her business to take an action I must take. It makes no sense to me to take another's person action. It is my business and she must stay out of this. She has no right to call him and talk to him. How come? I have never seen such situation. It makes no sense. What you think? Did she have the right to do that? I believe that when your friend is in a situation like mine, the best thing is to advice but not stir it up by saying things or acting for your friend. You don't touch other people's mess. Stay far and let's things cool down. I believe that.

						   I was married for about 4 years when I met this guy, who was also married. We started liking each other. In the beginning he used to tell me that his marriage was not good and that he was going to divorce his wife. But because she is not from here (USA), he promised her to stay with her until she gets her citizenship. In addition to this  they have a daughter together who he loves very much and as he says, she is what keeps him and his wife together. I am so in love with this guy that I started to destroy my marriage. Well, I will tell you the truth. Before this man came into my life, my marriage was not going good either. My husband was not satisfying me as he used to. I was not happy at all. So, I found in this man a new love. A new me. I knew I was doing wrong, but love is so blind that the wrong feels good.   It has been a year now that I have been seeing this guy. I have been separated from my husband for about 3 months and this guy have been separated from his wife for about 5 months now. We are still seeing each other, however, I seem to be too jealous and worry about our relationship too much. He lies all the time to me and I don't say or do anything. I keept it for myself because it is not relavant. These lies are all small. But I am watching him. I am making sure he doesn't make a big mistake. I have always told myself that if I catch him in a big lie, I will leave him alone. One of the things he does that I don't like is that he likes to chat with different girls from different places in the world. He talks to them like he is single and free like a bird. I have seen his messages on the archive and it hurts me really bad.   Sometimes I don't know why I am still with him. I know what he tells the girls. But sometimes I think he is just having fun. Most men lie anyway. I won't pressure him. I will let him be and I will be what I am. I know I am a good person, but I am doing wrong to myself. It is just too hard to get over this mess. I like him a lot and I know he likes me too. We get along pretty good, but sometimes I think he is using me, but because I like him so much, I don't want to open my eyes to see that I am doing wrong to myself. He told me once that his wife asked him to move back home and he said he was not sure if that is what he wants. I wish sometimes that he would just go back home before I get really hurt. It will be my fault if I get really hurt. We do have a good relationship besides all this mess. We have a good time together but only inside the box. I mean, we only see each other at my place or at his place. If we are in public, we are studying or doing some work together. There is no holding hands or hugging. I keep asking myself why I like living like this? I am in a blind love.  Things start getting worse when I tell my friend about this relationship and she doesn't agree....coming soon!

						   I love my boyfriend. I am really into that man. We get along really good. I want to be with him for the rest of my life. However, I am not dreaming. I know I have to keep my feet on the ground and make sure he doesn't hurt me. I need to go with the flow watching out for myself.   We went to the movie this weekend watch Fahrenheit 9/11. It was a movie that made me laugh and made me cry. I can't believe this president of the U.S. I am not from here and I know there is no honest president. The president of my country is very corrupt also, but this one over here....I am telling you...he is such a liar and a cold-hearted man. This war in Iraq was unecessary. Innocent people were killed and they still are being killed. Where is this world going? It is all about the oil and our gas prices are sky rising. Why? Why be so greedy and selfish? Anyway, my opinions about this movie in general are that I would not re-elect this man again if I was a voter. This is not right what he has been doing to his nation. I support our troops, but I wish they would stay home with their family and we would not need this war. The war was supposed to go get Bin Laden and not go to Iraq.   I would recommend everyone to watch this movie. Some people who love this president would not watch it because they refuse to see the truth. Well, I don't care. I watched and I don't like what this president is doing at all.

						   It seems that I have nothing else to write in here but my dilemma with my married boyfriend. He is such a loser. I know that and what I don't know is why I am still in love with him. I don't know why I am still spending time with him. I might be wasting time in my life, but I am also married. I am separated waiting for my stupid husband to give me a divorce. So I have nothing much to offer him anyway. I can't promise him anything anyway. I must go on with this until who knows...when I am divorced then I will make a decision. I will decide what to do with this man. I don't want to be waiting on him. He might never be divorced and if he does, our life won't be open to the world, it's still going to be a mystery. He won't ever stop seeing his wife because of their baby. Do I want that? Plus, he won't stop talking on the messenger with his girlfriends. He has over 100 girls listed on his messenger. He said he will stop talking to them if we are together, but I am sure this is bullshit. He will be talking to them behind my back.   So, there are a lot of stuff that I know is true and I don't care about any of that right now. I know I am true to him and to myself and that is important. I will wait for his love and dedication to me only. I am sure he loves me and I have been the best thing in his life. He won't find no one like me. I am sure! I can feel that. I can feel that I am really really good to him and he doesn't want to lose me!  Enough of that for now...hehehe I will be back with some more...these are just some thoughts of this wet morning down here....

						   I love my boyfriend, but I am hurt right now. I don't know why I feel like that. I know time will take care of it, but I just feel betrayed, hurt, and angry. I went home for lunch as I always do. When I got there, I got on the computer and there were still windows open. That was my boyfriend who was surfing in there earlier. He left his email window open and I started checking it. He has emails to and from the girls he talks online. One of these girls, he wants to bring her to America. She is from the Ukraine. He gives her his name and address and promises her he will bring her over. How come he does this to me?? He promises her he will send her money for her to get her passport and then after that get her visa. He told me that he just tells this to them to keep up a conversation. He doesn't really mean what he says. He told me he does that just for fun and to be distracted. Now, I have been nice to him. Everything he asks me, I do for him. He can't complain all I do for him is because I love him. This is not the first time I see some stupid things on his email or archived messages.  What type of woman do men like? That is what I want to know. Do I need to be a bitch and hard to deal with? Will he ever care for all I do for him? He is there at my place everyday. We sleep together everyday. He doesn't give me anything and I don't ask him for anything.  I am very easy to deal and I don't ask much but honesty. How long do I want to keep this mess going? Will he ever change? Will he be honest to me?  Is that what I really want for my life? What he has that I can't find in another man? I am sure I know the answers for all my questions, but I am in denial. I refuse to open my brain and heart and let him go. There is something about him that I love soooooooo much, but this is killing me. It is hurting me bad. I can't live this way. I know that. I don't need this anymore.  I deserve someone better that will treat me good and respect me. I don't need this shit.  When I left my house, I left open the window where I found the message and left a note on the desk saying "I C". Whenever he gets there today, he will see that and I can't wait to see his reaction. If he doesn't say anything, I don't know what to do. If he says something, I will go with the flow. Now, if I get to my house and his stuff are gone, I will know he is gone. Let's see what is going to happen whenever I get home from work.
