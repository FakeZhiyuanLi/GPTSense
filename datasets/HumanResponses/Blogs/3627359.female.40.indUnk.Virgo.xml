      the day of departure and i find it unsetling as i jingle my key ring.  i now only have two keys on my ring and they both belong to my bike.  my house is now my tent.  my only transportation, my bike.  the only things i own are on it.

      this is the day of departure and i was wide eyed at 5:15.  an oddity for me.  i am not an early bird.  i am not sure when will be the next time my body will see a mattress.

      well....after packing and repacking several times, i think i have it. several things have already gone bye, bye and i haven't even taken off yet. like my magnetic tank bag that i thought would be so handy is already gone.  because of where my gauges are, the tank bag has to sit really low which throws me off when trying to back my bike up.  i was trying to put my bike in the garage and can't get the leverage i need to pull it back like i normally do with that in the way.  i figured i don't need any more hassles.  in fact i have several kitchen size trash bags of things i thought i needed before that i'm now resigned to i can do without.  i'm less the tank bag, two pairs of jeans, several shirts, one light leather jacket and a few odds & ends out of my makeup bag.  i'm also resigned to the fact that as i get going i may be throwing out other things as well.

      Well my gauge before we take off says 7,371 miles.  I wonder how many miles I will actually log this year?  I bought this bike when the gauge read 1/2 mile and I said then that my goal was to put 100,000 miles on this bike all by myself.  Now it may be sooner than I had thought since this will be my only mode of transportation for the next several years.

      My last day in Thermop.  I really wanted to get to the pools and soak in some hot water before I take off....but I've got so much to do.  Everything I spend now is not specified in dollars....but rather how many nights camping I just spent.  Just yesterday Charlie and I saw a better way to pack my bike, so I ran to Riverton to pick up a different bag and have to repack everything (2 1/2 nights).  Hopefully this will help with the weight distribution so that I won't seem off balance with all my stuff.  I also bought a motorcycle cover (5 nights).  I thought it would be good to cover my bike during the day while I'm out browsing or hiking and at night if it rains.  In my experience most people don't bother bikes, but I'm from Wyoming where we don't lock our houses or cars either.  Since this is all I have and so much would be easily lifted....like my magnetic tank bag,  I might want to play it safe.  Met a husband and wife today from Arizona cruising on their Harley.  Marty is the President of the Old Bastards Motorcycle Club in Arizona.  Very nice people and they want me to give them a call when I get to Arizona and they will hook me up with a place to stay for the night and show me around.  They also gave me a great tip on an Ozark Mountain ride in October that I think I will have to try to schedule in for sure.  Funny, I'm not use to riding in October because of the cold weather.

      This was my final day of selling what I had left.  Had a garage sale and then we took what was left over to an antique lady that had been my best customer.  Clothes and everything are gone.  What is left is what will fit on my bike.  Just two more full days before I leave.  Getting anxious

      My mom gave me a book that is parents writing to their children.  It is called "To My Child" A Blue Mountain Arts Special Edition and on page 58 & 59 of this book is a letter written by Deanna Beisser that says so much about living life that I wanted to share it with you.  This is how I wish everyone would live.  The title of the letter is:  "Your life is a journey...make it a wonderful adventure."  The letter goes like this:  "Let your life be an exploration.  Let people and places be a part of your life, and experience each and every unique situation with a sense of wonder and delight.  Look in all directions to seek out the answers you long to know, and discover the secrets that keep questioning your heart.  Be willing to make changes and be ready to face the challenges.  Accept the opportunities that present themselves, and endure and cope with the difficulties that can arise from time to time.  Remember that there is no one way to live your life, but a thousand different ways for each of us to be.  Make your life the way you want it to be and create a lifestyle that brings you happiness.  Search for your true meaning in life by devoting yourself to your ideals, and enjoy your wonderful adventure through time by making every day special."  This is what my journey is all about.  Just 4 days and counting.  YIKES!!!!  Looking forward to it with excitement and anticipation for what lies ahead.

      Practice packing.  Still downsizing.  Decisions on what to take are getting harder by the day.  Just 5 days left.  Charlie changed my oil.  He put synthetic oil in....so this should get me 10k before I have to change again.  About the same time I will have to probably change my tires if not before.  Learned how to check the air pressure in my tires.  We have written a seperation agreement and letter to family and friends that we will mail on the day we leave.  We think the people in town will be quite suprised by it all because they see us together everyday down town enjoying each others company and holding hands.  There is no doubt that we still have a great love & respect for each other.  Don't know why things happen the way they do.  But we have just vowed that we would part great friends.  Right now with all this planning and packing, Charlie is my greatest confidant.  I also confided in another close friend in town today.  She has done a great deal of traveling on her own in the past and could relate to my need to experience this solo trip.  She gave me much needed support that will prove helpful in the days ahead I'm sure.  WOW, just 5 days.  I'm sure it will fly.  Hope the items I'm waiting on to arrive in the mail get here soon.

      My journey starts in less than 10 days and I got to spend some time with my daughter.  She is taking to my plan better now than at first.  When she tells others of her moms adventure, you can hear the pride in her voice.  Both of my kids are awesome, I couldn't have asked for any better.  Both are married now to wonderful partners (no grandkids) just another one of those reasons I have to live this dream now.  We all wonder when we'll get to meet as a family again and at this time there is no plan.  I also had a visit with my Grandmother who is 91.  She is normally pretty quiet but she shared some of her heart with me on taking God with me.  She is in good health now, but it is always a concern when being far away that something might happen and I won't get back in time to see her.

      My parents have been informed 11 days prior to departure.  Kind of had to clue them in since I took a box of pictures & papers to leave at their house.  The only thing I will own except for my motorcycle & what is on it.  Dad didn't say much, but that is because he can't really hear what we are talking about.  So he asks me as where unloading the car so do I understand that you are going for a trip on your motorcycle?  Mom is definitely freaked.  She doesn't tell me I can't but her whole conversation is loaded with warnings & fears & you can hear the quiver in her voice as she talks.  She thinks I should take the money from selling all my possessions to set up house right away in a new location.  That is the safe thing to do....which I've always done my whole entire life.  That is exactly why most people don't live their dreams.  I figure I have nothing to loose.  I don't have a house, a job, a retirement....my kids are grown with no grandkids on the way yet.  Perfect timing is what I'm thinking.  Even though when I stop I will have nothing, I figure I've been there before, just a little older this time.

      Decision has been made to split with my husband. That in itself is not a shock to many, we have split before.  What will shock those who know me personally is what I am about to do.  I find myself at a crossroads in my life.  I can not possibly think at this moment about going back to a desk job and working from 9 to 5 til the day I die.  I would think at 40 I would have a better grip on life.  But life throws us curve balls.   I am ready for a change.  I'm tired of doing the safe thing.  I have decided to sell everything I own, pack what I can on my Yamaha Vstar and tour America....SOLO.  Those I share these thought with generally have one of two opinions.  Some think I've got guts and others think I'm nuts.

      woke up this morning & someone asked me how long it took to get to maine &amp; it dawned on me that this is my 30th day on the road.  wow.  i can't believe i've gone this long.  funny though.  i was telling one of the campers how i was nervous to cross on a ferry boat.  she just giggled.  she couldn't believe i could come all this way & be afraid of anything.

      got in kind of late so didn't really talk to anybody.  just threw up the tent, headed for the bathrooms & to call the kids.  i sat by the water for a few minutes & then headed off to bed.  the next morning was buzzing with activity though.  i thought i might never get gone.  this camp ground is visited by many families every year.  parents started coming years ago, so now the kids & grandkids come as well.  got to eat breakfast with a real nice family who was really interested in my adventure & gave great advice as to where to hit on the coast.  after returning from breakfast the neighbors started talking & wanted me to stay for the day &amp; kayak with them.  man, didn't take them up on that offer, but that is definitely on my list of things to do in my life time.  also everyone wanted to make sure i had supplies.  do i need anything.  can we give you juice, candy bars....etc.  etc.  haven't had this good treatment for quite a while so it was refreshing to have people to talk to.

      depew ny.&nbsp; a street preacher named jim.&nbsp; don't know if this guy gets paid or not, or if this is just his passion, but he takes his job very seriously.&nbsp; i was looking for a road and thought maybe i had missed it so i pulled over.&nbsp; shortly after that jim pulls up.&nbsp; first words out of his mouth are what's your name.&nbsp; to which i replied nellie.&nbsp; second question out of his mouth was do you know jesus as your personal savior....so i reply yes.&nbsp; then he asks to hear my story.&nbsp; guess he wants to know if i'm sincere or just trying to avoid him.&nbsp; so i share my story.&nbsp; then i share what i've been through and he offers great encouragement & prays with me before i'm on my way.&nbsp; fact is that God has been bringing people to me everyday that offers me the support i need.&nbsp; if they are not strangers from the road, it comes from&nbsp; you my friends and family.&nbsp;

      1st time i've ever seen vehicles being loaded & unloaded from a ferry.&nbsp; everyone keeps telling me i need to take one, but i've been kind of nervous to do it.&nbsp; guess just that fear of the unknown.&nbsp; so i sit & watch &amp; decided....yes....i'm gonna have to brave it.&nbsp; but not today.&nbsp; this one is going back to new york where i just came from, so another day perhaps.&nbsp; lots of ferry's in this neck of the woods.&nbsp;

      any biker can relate to this feeling of being one with your bike.&nbsp; it is on those days you just want to ride & ride &amp; not be stopped by anything in your way.&nbsp; as i leave new york & cross on over to vermont there are hills and lots of curves.....i love it when i feel so connected with my bike as i lean into those curves.&nbsp; it's funny when your a biker....you look for the hills & curves.....but when you live life you try to avoid them.&nbsp;

      lots of pretty country but found the weather & people in general to be kind of "cold".&nbsp; people did tend to talk, but only if you spoke first.&nbsp;&nbsp; not nice to place a judgement on the whole state with just 4 days there, but was just my general perception.&nbsp; even the bikers at the gas stations where in their own little world.

      this is where we viewed the top of the falls.  you can get to a spot where you can see as the water rushed over & plunges down.  also got to see the falls with all the lights on & the fireworks.  a great friday night......even though solo.

      can't say which is better, both are spectacular.  rode on the mist of the maid.  for me, being highly cholosterphobic it was really refreshing to feel the cool breeze & mist coming off the falls.  got some young kid to take my picture, so hope they turn out.  for those who get motion sickness....probably should pop one of those pills as the water is pretty choppy as you get close to the falls.

      as i crossed over into canada for the first time ever i got a glimpse of what a border guard looks like with no personality.  let's see what could i equate that to?  maybe like eating brussel sprouts, cow tongue  or liver & onions, all which leave a horrible tast in my mouth.   guess we got picked on pretty good as the tour bus driver put it.  they unloaded our whole bus and took each of us in & gave us a lecture that next time we could be denied access without a birth certificate.   that was just the first time, least they picked on everyone.  then when crossing back to the us i seemed to be the only one they picked on.  maybe it was because i was the only "solo" person on the bus, or maybe it was my skin color or the hat, sportin a pretty tough biker look.  well i got questioned pretty thorough.  in that brief minute (which felt like a life time as i started sweating on this chilly night) he asked me four times where i was born.  that farmers tan i'm sportin' must be getting dark enough i don't look american anymore.   also the interegation included what i was doing in canada....duh....i'm on a tour bus & what items i was bringing back with me.  whew, made it out of there & back in the good ole usa.

      the last two nights have been particularly tough for me.  i think as the time draws near for me to go back home....you see there lies my problem, i have no home.  i always thought it would be major cool to take off, tour & find a new place to live....but i also thought i would do that with a partner.  so as i study the atlas over & over, not knowing the territory i am a bundle of nerves.  everything with in me wants to run back to my comfort zone, my thermopolis & just get a little apartment downtown.  i already know rent is dirt cheap, i already know & love the people, i already know i could walk everywhere i needed to during the winter.  it is all familiar.  it's a place i love & people i know.  it's something i haven't had for nearly 30 days, familiar territory.   so the battle from with in is on & i have to do a lot of self talk as panic tries to take over my thoughts & emotions.

      just this morning i was journaling in my notebook the things that i would like about stopping & setting up house & the things i would miss about my road trip.  well, one of the things i wrote was it would be nice to have a private bath.  well, wish has been fulfilled for two days anyway.  i am doing my niagra falls tour and they told me camping would be $20 & up or i could get a room for $29....so i opted for the room since the weather looks like the skies could open any moment & dump several inches on top of me.   plus i get a bus from my hotel to niagra falls & avoid paying parking fees.   i also have a t.v. so i can catch up on the news and it looks like my colorado family is getting dumped on.  hope you guys all made it o.k. through the storm.

      rush hour two days in a row.  mostly i take the little two lane roads and avoid big cities, but after taking 2 days to just skirt chicago, i decided to suck it up and go for it.  lucky me....got to ride through cleveland ohio 5:30 p.m.  one day & buffalo new york 4:30 p.m the next.  guess i do these crazy things so you guys have something good to read.   this is almost more than a girl from the north eastern plains of colorado & wyoming can handle.  when completely through town and i could stop & pry my death grip off the handle bars  and worked some major kinks out of my back, i was elated that i made it with no problems.   nothing worse than trying to watch all four sides of you at once.  got good directions for both routes though so could get on & off where i needed to with relative ease.   just rode through more traffic than is probably in the whole state of wyoming in 20 years.   well, i'll try not to do that again....just somedays seem to go that way.

      1) just because it looks like a good road on the atlas, doesn't mean necessarily that it is. 2) racoons like peaches, almonds, trident chewing gum &amp; sitting on my motorcycle - but not wasabee peas (these are like dried peas with a horseradish coating). 3) when you feel like you need a hug, go to the library &amp; read your emails from friends &amp; family 4) after a long day riding in the blazing sun, nothing feels quite as refreshing as a shower. 5) dirty clothes serve a purpose in soaking up the puddles in the corner of your tent. 6)&nbsp; fireflies look like glowing eyes in the bushes at night. 7) if you drive the speed limit,&nbsp;everyone is going to pass you. 8) if you pull out your atlas most people are willing to give&nbsp;advice - whether it be good or bad. 9)&nbsp;no matter how old you are - your parents still worry about you. 10)&nbsp; when&nbsp; your feeling you don't possible have the strength to go on - rest - it will return tomorrow. 11)&nbsp; there are no straight two lane roads in illinois or indiana 12) there are always going to be places you will want to come back to see. 13) a great purchase for a long&nbsp;ride is cruise control 14)&nbsp; a woman can really live with one pair shoes, three pair jeans and five shirts. 15)&nbsp; even though you meet a lot of neat people on the road - nothing sounds quite as good as a familiar voice on the other end of the phone. 16)&nbsp; you can really live three days without a shower - though not highly recommended. 17)&nbsp; only takes a minute to sweep out the tent &amp; then your chores are done. 18)&nbsp; hwy 41 will take you literally through milwaukee. 19)&nbsp; when you cry while riding your motorcycle it is like riding in the rain - only difference is the spots are inside your glasses instead of outside.&nbsp;  20) you've got plenty of time to think and that's why you can come up with all these ideas!

      as i talk with darrel on the phone i hear accoridan music being played in the campground.&nbsp; i wasn't sure if somebody just had their music turned up or if it was live.&nbsp; when i hang up the phone i have to go investigate.&nbsp; my mom use to play the accordian and it brings back fond memories of home.&nbsp; come to find out it is the first family i met when arriving that i spoke with.&nbsp; they invite me to sit &amp; listen &amp; eat a bite of supper with them.&nbsp; what&nbsp; a nice evening.&nbsp; hopefully i can spend some more time with them tomorrow evening.

      second night in a row, different location that coons have been on my bike.&nbsp;&nbsp; you can always tell by all the little muddy paw prints they leave behind.&nbsp; didn't hear them this night, but then i no longer have a cooler &amp; didn't have any trash either.&nbsp;

      couldn't figure what was outside my tent, but the neighbors down the way had a lattern burning and i could see shadows as they take a tour around my house and head straight for my trash.&nbsp;&nbsp;not only my trash but i had left my little canvas cooler&nbsp;outside as&nbsp;well.&nbsp; coons is what i think.&nbsp; i shined my little flashlight outside my tent and could just see a brown behind sticking out of the trash sack.&nbsp; it took me a while to fall back to sleep but when i woke in the morning i had to investigate all the mischief they had caused.&nbsp; i found that racoons like peaches, almonds, trident chewing gum and sitting on my motorcycle.&nbsp; couldn't believe all the muddy paw prints on my bike.&nbsp;

      if i would have just taken the interstate through chicago i probably could have made it in two hours, instead i spend the next entire two days trying to go around.....my map looks like a maze with all the roads i've taken.&nbsp; glad i'm not in any hurry and comfort myself in the fact that i'm seeling some beautiful country.

      for this price i should have a roof over my head, comfy mattress, flushing toilets &amp; cable t.v.&nbsp; after going through milwaukee &amp; seeing the signs that said i was fastly approaching chicago i decide it is time to call it a night.&nbsp; i didn't realize how exhausting everything had been &amp; finally see a campground sign so i pull in.&nbsp; i didn't even ask the price....just told her i wanted a tent spot, she asked if rustic would do.....yep, don't care.&nbsp; so i gave her my bank card &amp; she rung it up &amp; when i went to sign i about swallowed my tongue.&nbsp; you've got to be kidding $37 for a tent site.&nbsp; this didn't even include shade, picnic table or a good nights sleep.&nbsp; this was possibly my worst night ever, not just because of price but because i was surrounded by people that wanted to party til 2 in the morning.&nbsp; i break camp early &amp; get on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp; i have figured i want to go around chicago and not through it.&nbsp;

      sounds like this should be a title for a movie right?&nbsp; well, i got to live it.&nbsp; word of advice, don't take hwy 41 through milwaukee....cause that's what it will do, take you literally through milwaukee.&nbsp; i had to make all kinds of turns &amp; stops &amp; stops &amp; turns.&nbsp; once i lost sight of my hwy 41 sign so i had to turn around &amp; go back &amp; try to pick up the trail again....only problem is that milwaukee is built on an angle.&nbsp; if you think your going to take one turn and just go around the block, you may find that you can't do that....and try to get back to your trail is a whole another game.&nbsp; but i finally made it and once i got out &amp; onto the main highway i saw all kinds of neat old church steeples &amp; stuff.&nbsp; looks like it might have been interesting, but i'm not&nbsp;brave enough to go investigate.

      i wanted to title this blog jumped - but i didn't wan't to cause a panick in any of my fellow readers.&nbsp; when charlie &amp; i first married we made a pact.&nbsp; i was not to use tools &amp; he wasn't to use the checkbook.&nbsp; well, charlie improved - he got very good at balancing the check book.....but ole' nellie here never really improved with tools.&nbsp;&nbsp; so i did a boo, boo.&nbsp; after checking my mileage for the day - i left my key turned on and ran down my battery.&nbsp; luckily i'm still at the campground and they have a handy, dandy battery charger.&nbsp; so the guy gives it to me and sends me on my way....guess he figured if i can ride that thing by myself i ought to be able to jump it too.&nbsp; i walk away like a puppy with tail between legs.....a little nervous, cause i've never had to do this myself.....always had a man around.&nbsp; least he is kind enough to remind me black on negative &amp; red on positive.&nbsp; but i'm convinced even if i have to totally unpack my bike &amp; drag out my book i can do this.&nbsp; i remember where charlie said the tool kit was and pull it out for the first time.&nbsp; take out the allen wrench to take the cover off my batter cover....hook her up.....turn her on and listened to her purrrrrrrrrrrr.&nbsp;&nbsp; hey, i did it...and everything went smooth &amp; fast.&nbsp; feeling pretty good at this new accomplishment in my life.&nbsp;

      cute little town and after i walk around i decide to spend the night here.&nbsp; word of advice, if your going to stay here book ahead if you can or take your chances.&nbsp; good thing it was friday night because she only had two spaces left &amp; the next night she was completey full.&nbsp; i decide to walk downtown and have a burger at the blue ox - i saw their menu earlier in the day and it was reasonably priced and some locals said it was good.&nbsp; i sat at the counter &amp; started to tell some drunk my story &amp; he advertised it to the whole joint.&nbsp;&nbsp; needless to say we got quite a crowd at the bar &amp; i got all kinds of free drinks......so i drank plenty of club soda.....yep, who can drink &amp; ride......NOT ME!

      i stopped in this town for several hours to blog, mail stuff &amp; get something to eat.&nbsp; rena pulls up and runs across the street to see where i'm from &amp; where i'm going.&nbsp; she is another fellow woman solo rider who has been to all four corners of the us and shares her stories with me.&nbsp; she invites me to spend the night but i decline because it is 3 p.m. and i have only logged 100 miles &amp; feel the need to move on.&nbsp; after i take off i kind of kick myself because that is what this journey is all about is meeting new people &amp; seeing new places.&nbsp;

      i thought i was doing pretty good picking out my camp site, in fact i was darn proud of myself for taking a walk around the camp ground and finding the perfect spot where i could just ride my bike in and ride it out without trying to manouver it around to much....what i didn't really watch for was how close i was to the road.  needless to say i didn't sleep too well.  even got up to put ear plugs in during the night.

      riding through upper michigan....and run into my first fun (yeah right) road construction since i've been on my own.  always put charlie out in front of me in these situations and figured if charlie can make it so can i.  but i have to figure it out on my own on which path is the right one to ride on through all the dirt.  whew, may be a little tense but made it no problem....just a long line of traffic behind me that may be a little impatient.

      i'm sure glad i had to stop for this road construction because the lady in the car in front hops out and runs back to me and tells me to put the helmet on - or i'm risking a $75 fine.  didn't realize michigan was a helmet state so i'm thankful for her help....cause $75 would really blow my budget for the day.

      ironwood michigan is where i put my tent up for the night and so does martine.  martine is another woman solo adventurer on two wheels....hers though, requires physical strength.  she is pedaling from coast to coast along the northern route.  she is an incredible woman as this is not the first time she has soloed, but she's done so every year for the last 20.  it is almost dark when she arrives at camp and she is really tired but we share a few stories back and forth as she sets up her camp.  it's funny because even though on different days, we both spent wet & windy nights in the the same town - williston north dakota.  to me she is incredibly brave as she spends many nights out in the wilderness with no camp ground and no one else around.  she is an expert at this solo adventure stuff so i find it interesting looking at all her gear, because hers is way more compact than mine....maybe if i do this next year i will have acquired some more compact items like hers.  she said on her whole trip, this is only the second time she has camped at a campground so i feel very blessed to have met her.  even though our talk is brief, i feel connected to her in a way.  we exchange email addresses in hopes of staying in touch and hearing how the journey's went for each.  hope martine will become a friend for life.

      through the state of wisconsin, which by the way is state #8.  my intended ride is hwy 2 to 13 and back to 2.  i was glad i stopped at the tourist info center because she gave me another route because of road construction.  only logged about 160 miles here.  got to stop at bayfield to shop & walk around.

      ann marie has been a great inspiration over the last few days as she has been calling just to chat.  she can relate to a lot of the feelings i'm having right now because she has been on several solo adventures of her own.  we talk about the uncertainties & unknowns that each person faces when they live outside their comfort zone.  don't get me wrong, when i blog these daily challenges, i'm not looking for sympathy.  i'm just sharing some of the feelings a person goes through when living on the edge.  everyday is filled with uncertainties from where will i sleep - eat - shop - find the library - post office - gas & what will the roads be like...will they be smooth - bumpy - curvy - hilly - or torn up.  with each new day and each new challenge we have to dig a little deeper within ourselves to find the courage to face them.

      this is as far as i will take the north shore drive on this trip, but someday i will be back because everybody i've talked to says i need to take this ride up into canada.  gooseberry falls are beautiful.  i take time to hike around & get one helpful gentleman to snap my picture near the falls.  this drive is only about 30 miles north of duluth and worth the trip if your ever this way.  it has a nice visitor center/gift shop, great hiking trails and you can even take your shoes off and stick your feet in the water which is great on a hot summers day like today.

      after exploring duluth a bit i take the scenic hiway up the north shore of lake superior.  this is just like driving along the shoreline of any ocean, beautiful.  as i ride through two harbors, i know i will have to stop on my way back because it looks like a cute little town to explore, but right now my destination is gooseberry state park to look at the falls.

      hey i'm on his trail.  i heard said that he was going to be in town today but i didn't have any other details about where & when.  so as i took time to do some hiking around duluth i was walking around the harbor & noticed a lot of action taking place at the convention center.  i figured this is probably where he was going to be since i could see through the glass windows officers taking what looked like bomb sniffing dogs around.  i finally get close enough to an officer to ask about all the action and he tells me i'm correct.  bush is suppose to arrive in another 6 hours and he tells me they will continue to tighten security in this area as each hour approaches and told me i'm just darn lucky to take this little harbor walk at all.  he also tells me that my chances of getting anywhere remotely close to any of the action tonight are very very slim....darn!

      terry, ann marie's friend....which forever be my friend now too has offered me a wonderful retreat at his cabin & 40 acres.  he happens to be taking off for the next week up the road to work, so i get this place all to myself.  monday i take & don't even get on my bike, i sleep & get up & move around a bit, then sleep some more.  it is a wonderfully refreshing day...i actually feel my whole spirit renewed.  i was starting to get a little discouraged, but after a day of rest my body revives itself.

      ever have one of those dreams that are just so real that you wake up in a cold sweat.  don't know if it was my subconcious just knowing some of the characters that were tented beside me or what but i had the most realistic dream.  my house (tent) door has two zippers....one on the bottom & one that zips up the side & top.  well in my dream i could hear just as clear as anything my two zippers go....first the bottom, then the top....in my dream i could not wake up....i was trying to wake myself up & thinking in my dream if i could just wake up & get out of this sleeping bag, first i could kick my intruder to stunn them, then grab my pepper spray & spray them....well by the time i woke out of this nightmare i was in a cold sweat, grabbing for my stuff & ready to spray....someone who was never there to begin with.  with a little self talk i was able to get back to sleep.

      my destination is duluth which is only 50 miles away....but i am very tired & still shaky from dumping my bike the day before.  not only am i tired but in between my shoulder blades are extremely tense.  so i decide i need to pull over for the night.  what i didn't realize that this little town i'm in is in the middle of a three day celebration known as cat fish days.  tonite just happens to be a street dance.  i'm tired but knowing that i probably won't get much sleep, I decide to shower & go have a cup of coffee & walk down & check all the action out.  i haven't been out at all since i've left home, and just feeling a little ackward about going in because i'm all alone & don't know a single soul...but i figure this $4 i'm about to spend will be the best entertainment i've had in a long while and if all's i do is people watch it will be worth it.  i do actually find another biker who is alone to have conversation with to pass some of the time.  after he leaves...i'm only able to withstand about another hour of all the excitement then decide to head back to my tent & try to sleep before everyone comes back to camp & starts to party.

      ann marie & charlie will be amazed by this more than most of  you because they actually saw my bike when i took off. but now with leaving a trail of things thrown out every single day since i've left i can (with the help of greg & a great compression sack for my sleeping bag) can fit everything inside my black bag that sits behind me.  still a heavy sucker....but i'm looking better for it.

      by the way when i pulled up to greg & linda's home on friday evening the 9th of july, greg informs me that i just crossed over into minnesota.  this makes state # 7....never, ever been here either.  since i'm obviously off my route #2...since i got lost going around devils lake....greg gives me another scenic route to duluth.  from moorehead minnesota i take hwy 10, to 34, to junction 200 (yep that infamous hwy) to hwy 2.  it does prove to be just a gorgeous drive.  clouds are icky when i rise early in the morning....but i stay dry all day.

      after the kindness i've been shown the last several days i realize how selfish i've been in my own life & how important "things" have been to me.  i don't know how willing i would have been to invite total strangers into my home fearing that they may take some of my "things".  but after this traveling solo trip, i think on my next home i will just install a swinging door that those who are traveling solo can just come & go.

      if there is one thing we rely on when traveling solo, it is the kindness of strangers.  after greg helps me get my bike up, we introduce ourselves & he offers me a place to stay, do laundry & shower.  Greg & Linda i hope the Lord showers you with a 100 blessings for opening up your home & making yourself vunerable to the unknownness of a total stranger.

      luckily i was pulling over to talk to a big strong biker that i had just met up the road.  yep....only 2nd time in my life but laid my bike over.  nothings hurt....just my pride and self esteem.  greg & i got her in the upright position which i hope to keep it for the rest of the trip.  this does however affect me for the next several days.  seems my self confidence isn't very good & feel shaky with my bike for several days in a row.  trying to shake it off and talk myself through it.

      seems everytime i drive around a big body of water i get lost....and you guessed it, i always end up at junction 200.  this let's me know i'm on the wrong road again.  i hope over the next 60 days my map reading skills improve.  however....both times i've been lost i have really ended up with some great rides & met neat people....so maybe being lost isn't so bad after all.

      this is a drive well worth it if you find yourself out this way.  devil's lake is a lake with no inlet or outlet & over the last 10 years it has been steadily rising.  over the last 10 years this lake has risen over 24' & has consumed more than 81,000 acres of privately owned land.  they have to keep building up the road so that people have access to it and it is awesome as you drive out onto this little two land road with lake on both sides up to the very edge of the road.  it gives you a feeling that you are driving out into the middle of the ocean.  a definite "to do" if your ever close.

      as i leave minot i am driving about 5 mph under the speed limit.  the sun & warmth feel so good to me i just want to soak it up.  as i near devils lake i notice huge puddles of water every where.  where we have irrigation ditches in farm country looks like entire canals of water.  when i stop into the chamber at devils lake to talk to the people they have told me they have had extreme wet & flooding.  in fact it has been so wet in places the water is consuming the farm land around.  i also notice that the birds are changing from what i'm used to seeing.

      raised in north dakota and some one asked me to paint a picture of the sun i would paint it hot pink.  the sunset tonight was the most beautiful i've ever seen in my whole life.  the whole entire sun was a hot pink....not just the clouds around like we see in many sunsets from wyoming but the actual sun itself.  WOW!

      Rose early to blue sky.  YEAH!!!  i don't even put my chaps on for my early morning ride of 55 miles to minot for my new tire.  people at action cycles are awesome.  they pull me right in, quit the job their currently working on and slap my tire on in less than an hour.  i even came in under budget with labor & all.  as they listen to my story of my adventure the mechanic has traveled this road many times and give me all the scenic detours.  they all send me off with their blessings.

      rode only 20 miles & pulled over for gas & was seriously regretting packing up my tent.  should have stayed one more night.  however as i ride to the restraunt & try to wait out more rain & wind i overhear two men talking about yamaha dealerships.  i consult with them & find out Bob Obertson use to be a sales rep for Yamaha & was just one minute ago talking to the president of Yamaha from Japan.  perfect person to ask about my rear tire that i'm needing to replace.  he invites me to his house just up the road another 20 miles & offers to do all the calling to find me the tire.  as i near stanley where he lives here comes the rain again & not a blue speck of sky.  looks like it is here to stay for the day.  bob takes me down town and introduces me to all the locals & suggests i stay at his house for the evening.  never had to take charity from a stranger before & a hard thing for me to swallow.  he already has a house full of company.  one couple is in a down stairs bedroom & his daughter & grandson is upstairs but he still has one spare bedroom.  a bed and a roof would feel good, and with all these other people i feel safe, so i take him up on his offer.  we even take a trip over to new town with some of his buddies to gamble at a casino.  only drop two dollars & won nothing so i just spend the night enjoying people watching.

      camp parking lot is full of puddles.  poured rain from 7 p.m. to nearly 2 a.m.  finally at 2 i think i can finally get some rest as the wind & rain dies down.  the whole time i was worried about where i parked my bike and if it decided to crater that it would crush me inside my tent.  i'll have no dry towel as it is used in one corner to soak up some of the wet that came in.  i was also using all my dirty clothes to soak up water.  this is my welcome to north dakota as i spend my first night here in williston.  i consult with the camp director and she thinks if i can get to minot i will ride out of it so after spending time talking with here at 11 a.m. i finally pack up.  report is we got 4 inches of rain last night.  as scary as the whole thing was...i survived!

      ...when you have 40  miles to go & the wind just blows & blows it seems like forever.  stop to eat to see if it dies down with no luck.  hope my house doesn't take off like a kite while it is being assembled.  weather looks nasty so i throw the tent up fast...have trouble with spikes going in the ground but succeed.  put my stuff in all four corners to hold her down....this wind is nasty.  as i bunker down at 7 p.m. because of the wind & rain i feel like i'm inside a diaphram as the wind sucks my tent in and let's it out like a long held breath.  guess i'll just journal, write cards & listen to music.

      as i near culbertson montana wind gusts slow me down considerably.  i pull over to a place to refresh myself & get a wonderful treat.  a kona mocha ice rage....i got addicted to these when living in thermop and haven't had one in over 10 days.  as i talk to one of the locals about the wind he said the weather predicts hail & wind gusts in excess of 60 mph.  i think i've already hit those.  decide to move on though....hoping to ride out of it.

      o.k. so i looked at the map once.  took a ride out to fort peck resevior because it didn't look like it was too far out of the way.  what i didn't do though was go through the town of fort peck and instead just kept going around the damn area.  before i realized what i was doing i had 90 miles on my tank.  i'm on a narrow two lane with no pull outs to stop and look at my map so i just keep on going....it was a beautiful ride & the weather was great....and i saw the sign that said junction 200 was on 30 miles away.  what i didn't realize was that gas was 60 miles away.  as i log 125 miles on this tank i am in the middle of passing a semi and my bike chugs....CRAP!!!  i realize i still have reserve left and luckily for me i've been trying to remember to shut my gas off every evening so i have a good grasp on where my reserve is located....so i reach down....hoping i can do this in motion because i'm on a narrow two lane with a semi on my tail & one hill after another.  took me about two tries....but SUCCESS!!!  in the future i'll try not to let this happen.

      after riding so long i thought i would spend my first night at browning montana....until i rode into town and realized i felt like the only white woman in town.  then i started looking at the vehicles and what seemed like every one was either crunched or missing parts.  yikes!!!  i decided it would be a good thing to ride on.  stayed at cut bank at riverview rv park for just $7 with hot showers & telephones to touch base with both kendra & darrel.

      i complained of charlie, but i myself rode 348 miles the first day without stopping to eat.  maybe i was just trying to put some miles between me and home so i wouldn't be so tempted to turn and run and beg to have my home and family back.  both charlie and i had agreed this would be best even though i don't understand it.  i don't understand how you can love someone so much and still not make things work.

      rode about 100 miles with charlie before we say goodbye.  the montana hiways gonna be clean after it is washed with all my tears.  the good news is that i got a new bed (sleeping bag).  i've been cold every night since i left and since this will be my first night alone and no charlie to snuggle up to.  gave the old sleeping bag to an older gentleman & his wife who are traveling by rv.  after spending time talking to them while repacking my bags he offers his best wishes and promises to keep me in his prayers.  btw, thanks to all of you who remember me in your prayers.  i really do appreciate it.

      spent the night at wolf lodge coeur d' alene idaho.  beautiful lake here.  charlie & i decided over supper that this would be our last night together.  as we ride back to the campground 2 up on charlies bike....hot tears stream down my face knowing this will be my last ride behind him.  i'll miss him dearly.  as much as i've complained about his hard riding, it has been a great ride and i really enjoy his company.  took a shower and climbed into what is now my bed (sleeping bag).  i try desperately to fight the tears but they come anyway and my body shakes uncontrollably.  there is so much i want to say to him but words can't even be spoken.  time of no emotion is over.

      wet on the windshield & wet on the glasses...for miles and miles.  woke up to rain so we packed up everything wet got on the bikes in hope of riding out of it.  not much luck....as soon as we got out of the rain the winds started blowing.  stayed at brooks memorial state park just outside of yakima washington.  tired, tired, tired.  however just down the road charlie bought a bottle of washington wine that we drank along with some greek food that we bought down the road made at a monestary by nuns.  after consuming most of the wine myself and the ride today....no doubt i will sleep good.

      charlie says we can slow down now, but did we???  we put on some 230 miles up hiway coast 101.  with the windy roads and rolling hills might as well been 400.  someday i want to take some time and ride this coast.  absolutely beautiful.  one of the places we did stop was at the sea lion caves.  we did get to see sea lions swim in the ocean.  stayed at lincoln city.  cold & misty night.

      left before scheduled and traveled 12 hours.  i should remember riding with charlie we just have to reach our destination and forget about enjoying anything along the way.  camped at craters of the moon state park in idaho on hwy 20-26.  got dumped on right before we reached camp.  today i rode through the heaviest rain ever and went through some of the worst road construction.  it took all i could muster to keep my bike in the upright position through the soft deep dirt.  sleeping bag just slightly damp...sure it won't be the last time i sleep wet.

      as i was in new jersey sitting in my hotel room i was watching the weather channel and found out i was headed right into tropical storm alex or so i thought.  i was really disappointed because after i had traveled all this way and had planned since before i left to come see my cousin i was afraid my plan would be ruined.  lucky for me though sherri is enough inland that i was never bothered by it.

      it is so hard to keep up but north carolina is actually my 25th state i've ridden since i left wyoming.  WOW!  seen a lot and ridden a lot of major cities.  i am going to try to avoid any more big towns and cities - but i don't know why after i've taken on some of the most major ones in the u.s.

      well i've ridden 8,000 miles since i've started my journey.  so it is time for a much needed oil change.  so since i've been on the road i've gotten two new tires and oil.  other than that my bike is running like a charm.  the mechanic who changes my oil reminds me so much of our old mechanic that we had back in yuma colorado george who got killed on his motorcycle several years ago.  just a good ole boy.  he takes the time while he has it up on the ramps to do quick checks on everything making sure i got plenty of brake pad, everythings tight and he even adjusts my throttle that was wanting to stick because of my cruise control.  should be ready to roll.

      the only planned stop on the road of someone that i know.  i make it to my cousins on her day off.  sherri and i use to be really close when we were growing up but haven't seen each other but maybe once in the last 22 years.  we got a lot of catching up to do.   we stay up and giggle and talk and act like two young school girls.  how fun.  she talks me into staying a whole 6 days and begs for even more time.  this is an awesome time to catch up, rest and relax.  i even have time to do internet research on where i might want this trip to end for this year.

      i'm on my way to my cousins in north carolina and i know i need to make time to get there by her day off, so everyone suggests the only easy way is to ride 1-95.  so from new jersey to washington d.c. and almost to richmond virgina i ride the interstate.  when i talk to people later they say that is probably the worst road for heavy traffic in the united states.   i was on this road for about 7 hours trying to make time.  all the time 3-6 lanes of constant traffic.  once in a while the interstate would totally back up with a traffic jam and i was actually thankful because every one had to slow down and i could take a bit of a breather.    i pull over at a rest stop and literally shake.  i can feel it in my legs, arms and hands.    i'm a bundle of nerves.  i know i have to get off this road.  i had one extremely close call, but i  tell you i think the Lord cleared the one lane so i was able to scoot over before i got ran over.  i don't even want to leave the rest area i'm so unnerved.  so i get out the atlas and plan a route that looks like two lanes and go talk to the tourist info gal and she says another 15 miles and i can be out of this traffic.  before i leave the rest area i meet another biker and he is traveling on I-95 through richmond and says if i could follow him for just 1 1/2 hours more we would be out of traffic.  even though i know i won't make it to my cousins today because of my slower route i know i can't go back out there.  i told him thanks, but i would rather slit my wrists than to ride in any more of that.

      well even after 30 days i find things i can live without.  probably two of the hardest items though was my blow dryer and curling iron.  don't know why.  i haven't used them since i left.  i always just wear my hat.  but after lugging this huge honking bag around i always like to lighten it so in the garbage they go.

      my only knowledge of new jersey is what i learned from the turnpike.  trees & brush is all i really saw just riding the turnpike, you could never see beyond it was so thick.    i do know they have friendly folk, lots of traffic, get lots of rain and high humidity.

      after my iron butt run, one more day at the hotel doesn't sound all that bad - so i splurge.  besides this is a big town and i should be able to find the library.  as i sit and eat breakfast i inquire of someone sitting at the counter about the humidity.  i knew it was high, but since i've never lived in a higher climate i wasn't sure what it was.  he tells me it had to be close to 100%.  he thought around 98% was right just from his knowledge of what it felt like.  i ask directions and head off for the library to blog.  i had to pull over and ask directions a couple of times before i got there, then when i arrived there was a big sign on the door closed til october for remodeling.  if i had known this i would have left.  i just needed my internet fix so bad it was making all the decisions for me.

      wow, a bed never looked so good after riding for 25 hours straight.  it was sure a night that i don't ever want to relive, but i feel proud of myself for making it.  i don't even feel like i have the strength to shower, but i force myself and fall into bed.  i think my lights were out before my head even hit the pillow.

      wow, i've never ridden through such heavy rain.  i figure if no one rear ends me cause they can't see my tail light or if i don't hydroplane i can make it.  the supposed to be hour long ride actually takes me two, but that got me right to the hotel at 11:00.  if any of you watched the weather channel that day on new jersey you probably saw the flooding that i was riding through.  i was in camden county.  reports where the next day that rain was falling at 2" an hour.  talk about being soaked to the bone.  as i pull up to pay my toll i had to lift my rain jacket to get to my purse, and i had this huge puddle of water that had gathered in my lap.  the toll booth attendant and i just laughed as this huge puddle from my lap got dumped from my jacket.

      the visitor center was so helpful.  right where i was stopped she said rooms still ran $120 and up but if i could make it south just about an hour away she could get me a room for $50.  even though the rain is pouring i take it.  she makes the call and gives me excellent directions.  she even got me an early check in time.  the usually don't let people check in til 1:00 and she talks them into a 11:00 check in.  that will make 25 hours on the bike.  i've got blisters on my hands from holding on for so long.

      20 hours on the bike and guess what?  here comes the rain.  so i laugh.  it was getting pretty rough at one point so i found a rest pull out with gas, eats and a visitor center.  as i wait til the visitor center opens the rain just pours and pours.  i am now in new jersey on the turn pike.

      actually my night ride wasn't all that bad.  i only had a light jacket on and was never really even chilled.  however as the morning is dawning it looks like we could get rain.  as rough as last night was, i didn't really let anything get to me.  at some points i felt a little like crying, but as the night went on i just began to laugh at everything that was happening.  it was just too commical.  maybe my laughter was to cover the pain, but it sure helped.

      i got to say one thing for this city, there bridges are spectacular.  i wish i could have pulled over and just looked at them and gotten pictures of the bridges and my bike, but there is no where to really do that.  so i just have to travel over them and soak in how spectacular they are from above.  i even had to pay a toll to go across one.  my whole night was kind of a blurr but i know i crossed over into queens and staten island for certain.

      have any of you ever driven in new york city?  they have got to get a prize for the worst roads ever.  the interstates have huge pieces of road missing.  you'll just be cruising along and all a sudden you just drop down, then up, then down and they throw you from side to side.  i was actually glad it was starting to get light out so i could see the roads.  i think maybe the huge traffic jam was for my safety so i didn't have to take them on in the dark.

      well since i'm not sleeping tonight i figured nyc by night would be the perfect plan.  i forgot somewhere along the way that nyc is the city that never sleeps.  it is about 4 a.m. and i run into a major traffic jam.  we all sit and just wait.  i have my bike turned off and my kickstand down.  i have to laugh cause everyone is talking on their cell phones.  who are they talking to this time of day i wonder?  well for 1 1/2 hours we just creep.  most of the times i don't even start my bike i just push in the clutch and creep forward trying to keep my front tire to the person ahead of me bumper.  people really start to honk & yell if you let someone squeeze in front of you.  this is no time to be kind i guess.   after an hour and a half of just creeping along we finally come to our first exit.  i don't know where it leads and i had my route planned but traffic still isn't moving so i figure if it is an interstate that leads south or west it should get me out of the city and after i'm completely out i can figure out where i am.  so i take the first exit.  never did find out what all the hold up was about.  i tried to talk to two people in cars with windows rolled down but i don't think either one spoke english.

      2 days after the democratic convention is over i ride through boston on a saturday afternoon.  i'm on 1-95 just trying to get through town.  stop and go for 2 hours.  i even get to snap pictures of the boston skyline from the freeway while i sit and wait.  i never knew they made tunnels like these.  someday i will have to look up the statistics for you all.  these tunnels go on for ever and they have on and off ramps everywhere.  it is totally wild.

      after trying desperately to find camping or lodging of any kind i'm wiped out.  it is almost midnight and i'm not sure what to do.  when i almost break down and cry in front of the lobby attendant that wanted $120 for a room he suggests the local truck stop.  so i resign myself to the fact this will have to do and head for the truckers lounge.  i try to get comfortable in an old theater seat so i can actually catch a few winks.  t.v. is blaring, truckers in and out but i sit back and close my eyes.  i think i actually did catch a few winks over the 1 1/2 hours i spent there.  i convince myself as i walk out into the dark night to continue riding that i'm o.k. and can go on.

      trying to find a campground.  these roads around here are weird.  it's getting dark and i'm trying desperately to find a camp ground.  the entrances are impossible to find in the dark.  i follow several roads where they say camping & never run across one.  the roads are so weird that i travel the same roads over & over again going in circles.  wow, i finally just head south.  don't know what else to do.

      ever hear of the iron butt run?  it is where bikers push themselves to ride 1,000 miles in 24 hours.  well, almost made it. try 660 miles in 24 hours.  why you ask?  let's just say i was trying to build character that day.  not on purpose.  some things just happen on the road.  problem is that i don't really plan, but i have learned one thing.  don't try to go to a major tourist attraction in the middle of summer on a saturday night without reservations.  i was heading towards cape cod.  i realized before i got there when i got to plymouth massachutes that this was a really bad idea so i turned and headed into rhode island & connecticut.  problem is the whole time i was on hwy 1 which is still on the coast.  no vacancies everywhere i went & when i did find a hotel they wanted $120 and up.  sorry, just not in my budget.  so 10:30 at night i'm sitting at mcdonalds and come up with the perfect plan.  it is a beautiful night and a full moon, maybe my destiny is to take nyc in the middle of the night.

      hard fast stop.  this is something that will make your heart skip a beat or two when you hear the sound of screeching tires and know that there your own.  this was probably the scariest moment of my life as a biker and as close as i've ever came to just totally loosing it.  i was following russ in portland maine and he didn't want to leave me in the dust so he stopped on a yellow and i was just to the point of accelleration.  wow.  i knew i had lost traction with my rear tire and i could feel it all over the road and i just held on for dear life.  luckily kept control and made it in time but man does it make you think of all the things that could have gone wrong.  as we pull over and he checks how i'm doing i'm just a basket case.  luckily he talk me through it and encourages me that i did great.  he even said that it was wickedly awesome and wonders if i want to repeat it so he can watch it all again.  no, never....thanks anyway.

      portland maine right after my last blog...in fact in the library i met russel.  russ started the conversation by saying i see your from wyoming.  so we started talking.  russ had researched wyoming thouroughly and was planning on moving there so he knew all my old stomping grounds.  i can't tell you how great it was to have a connection with someone that knew where i was from.  russ rides a victory so he offers to lead me to my first view of the atlantic ocean.  it was great to actually follow a tail light for a change.  russ was more than just a biker to follow his knowledge of portland maine was awesome so i also got a history lesson along the way.
