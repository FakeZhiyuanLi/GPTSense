      After reading my site, the designer of www.thegrimblog.blogspot.com realised that he had done somethin really disgusting and has decided to change his layout once more. This is what he told our reporters at the grim blog hate page: 'I really liked Julians layout, but i decided that I cant have the same as his, i'm meant to show that his is bad and mine is good, but then again... his is much better.'   The grim blog hate page brings you the latest news on thegrimblog once more.  Julian

      It has just come to my attention that Katie has been saying evil things on this message board, no abuse shall be tolerated, if any more is found abusing anything but www.thegrimblog.blogspot.com I will have to take appropriate action, as in deleting it. Thank you:)  Julian (the master of the site)

      It has come to my attention recently that the evil site www.thegrimblog.blogspot.com has decided that it didnt like its own template settings and has disgustingly taken a much superior one which is coincidentally exactly the same as mine!  I will take immediate action by taking the person responsible to court. Wish me luck  Julian

      It has come to my attention that nothing has been done on www.thegrimblog.blogspot.com for quite a while which has caused me to have little to write about.  We need to make the scum that make that website do more!!!!  By sending 10 pounds a month to me, you too can make a difference, just 10 pounds a month will help me to hire a hitman in order to eliminate the maker of the site so i can take control and make it good for all you special people who deserve it.  Imagine a site which had interesting stuff on it, imagine a site which you could be proud to look at. It is possible.  So please, donate generously, and you too, can help make a difference.  Thank you  Julian
