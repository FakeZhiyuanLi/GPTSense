						   Have been experiencing a nice & wonderful life for the past days of my life. A wonderful woman whom I've loved every day, every minute, every seconds of my life up to today, up to now. Have been experiencing the joy of working out my biceps, triceps &amp; abs. Feel stronger everyday, feel energetic everyday. Life seems to pass by with meanings now at least than the times it used to be in the past...  To the woman I've loved for 5 years 1 month &amp; 5 days..... "Honey, I love you, and I always will"

						   Received a call in the morning, was told that due to some unforseen circumstances, piano could not be scheduled to deliver today.... so sad... when released the news to Honey, she was kinda sad too.... was told that they could only make delivery on next Tuesday (20th Jul 2004)&nbsp;instead. Time passes slowly as it reaches around 11++a.m Somebody knocked on the door & tada! Piano has arrived, it looks so nice, so elegant &amp; Honey was eagerly playing with it the moment it was being setup. Tidied the whole bedroom eventually &amp; have the piano moved in... Honey was so excited the whole day that she sms her friend to share the joy...

						   Brought Honey to JE IMM & went to the piano shop.... did some calculation &amp; notice that budget is kinda tight this month... To Honey's surprise, she was shocked when I have "extra" cash in my bank account.&nbsp;(I'll sincerely&nbsp;& truthfully&nbsp;thank&nbsp;the person, whom gave me the loan in order to fulfil part of&nbsp;Honey's dream)&nbsp;&nbsp;She's overjoyed & I'm so happy to see the reaction on her face. Ordered the piano eventually &amp; will be delivered on Friday (16th Jul 2004)..&nbsp; She's so excited about the piano arriving soon...

						   Ice Skating was so fun with&nbsp;Honey. Oh gosh, to my amaze, she's a fast learner, able to start skating in the middle of the ring in less than 1/2 an hours time of learning. Both of us fell down many times but it was fun netherless... she's thinking of going to ice-skating tomorrow again....

						   Went to Jurong East to look @ ice-skating ring for timing & pricing.... Saw PX-100 piano while having dinner @ Jurong IMM @ a later time, knew that Honey liked it very much (weird plans coming to my mind......) Took bus 51 back home &amp; it was a wonderful time of our life......
