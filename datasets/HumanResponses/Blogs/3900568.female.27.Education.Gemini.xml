       "Being a lady is more than being just female. Being feminine is more than just being opposite a male."                              Is Your Secret Place Cherished?    There once was a young black woman named Nya. Even though her slave master had her covered in rags you could still see her beauty. She was the talk of the town. She had smooth, dark, chocolate skin; perfect breast and hips that natturally swayed back and forth mesmerizing you when she walked.  Ooh! The white women hated her and degraded her every chance they got. Especially the slave master's wife. But to Nya, her beauty was a curse because every evening when the sun went down, the slave master would sneak out to lay with her. She wasn't hurt because of what she personally had to endure. She was hurt because the one thing, that one secret place that belonged to her husband, belonged to him no more. They used to be a perfect fit and now they felt disconnected. She was dying on the inside because her ministering tool was damaged and he was dying on the inside because he couldn't protect his wife.     There once was a young black woman named Monique. Even though her slave mastter had her covered in shame and lust, you could still see her beauty. She was the talk of the town. She had smooth, dark, chocolate skin, perfect breasts and hips that naturally swayed back and forth mesmerizing you when she walked. Oohh! The women hated her because many times she was the other woman. It didn't really matter to her whether he was single or married. Every evening she would lay with a man to fulfill her own selfish desires. When she did meet her husband she was so devastated that her ministering tool was damaged. The one thing, that one secret place that should have belonged to her husband was stolen by her slave master. It's really sad that during slave times, black women would have given anything to protect that secret place for their husbands and now a days we give it away freely forgetting the purpose of our womanhood. We are quick to pass judgement on the men not stepping up to the plate when we need to first take the plank out of our eyes. Ladies, get a new master and He will show you how to cherish your secret place.(copyright2004)  Ladies, we need to start cherishing what God has blessed us with and stop giving it away to people that don't belong to us. A true lady cherishes her secret place and keeps it hidden until her husband comes.  I welcome your comments on this. More will be added later in the week. In the meantime I pray many blessings upon God's people. If you haven't accepted Jesus yet, I pray God knocks on your door and you let Him in.   God bless
