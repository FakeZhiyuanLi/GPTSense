      There is thunder outside. It brings me fear.  There is music within. It calms me. If I had the artist’s strength and ability, I’d paint the window. It is beautiful. Droplets of rain having run furiously down are now moving with calm. Each drop assumes its own direction, its own life. Some are still, some still moving. They tell a story- once started, but never finished.  The sky is orange. It is indifferent. It is dead. It gave all its life to these fine droplets of nature. These little miracles.   No I am wrong. The sky is not dead. Lightning just struck in the sky and spoke out in its defense.  Then calm prevailed.  Darkness is crouching on me, but really slowly. I don’t know which is better…light or darkness! Looking out the window, I find peace. In the music I find peace.  But peace comes with a dowry of memories and sadness. But I embrace it. It is only through this sadness that I will discover myself, befriend myself and purge my soul.

      There are moments in your life when you feel that you are descending in to a dark abyss-emotionally and physically. Your insides tighten, your heartbeat picks up pace, beads of perspiration break out on your forehead. You try and go on as normally as you can, but every moment of solitude attacks you like a fatal disease. You want escape, but you cannot. You are bound to this life.   You just wish that some one would pull you out, but you come to a point that you don’t want to be helped. You want to reach out, but then you shy away. You sink further in to this abyss.   You hallucinate! You see walls closing in on you, the world spinning around you, faces trying to talk to you- but you are frozen- frozen in consciousness. You think you are responding, but words fail you- you just have a blank look in your eyes- an expressionless emotion. A remnant of some sadness; the remains of some memory, all lodged into that look- in the blank eyes.   You sink further in the abyss- a point where you drive yourself to madness- madness that only you are party to- that is your only privilege. But you know deep down inside that it is all an act. You feel the agony; your fingers tremble; your mind suffers- you wish for numbness, but you know that it won’t come to you- not without a price at least.  The abyss is so surreal. You collapse. There is ringing in your ears- an inner signal, bringing you back. You try and shield yourself from reality- as you would against sunlight on a hot desert morning- your hands flailing. You close your eyes, wanting to block it all out- but you only squirm in defeat.   The abyss is so dark and hazy sometimes. You know you are present, physically, and you know there is light- but you don’t see things- you see black specks; the world as one diffused black speck and then you wonder about your sanity again.  You want to get out of the abyss, but you know that is not an option you have. You make the abyss a bearable place for you- at least on those occasions that you can.

      So alone So sad No one close by No one to hold on to Treading on a tight rope  In a long dark tunnel Afraid of falling Afraid of screaming Holding on to my fears Wishing for escape Crushed from inside I walk my tight rope Hoping to find someone  At the end of the tunnel Someone to hold me  And break my fall Yet I know Beyond the tunnel is emptiness too

      Orange skies whispering  Urging me to look within  It hurts…deep within Pain I cant describe But which continues to thrive   Orange skies whispering Shedding tears with me  The droplets claw at the window In them I see reflections Of an unlived life  Wanting to sink  Yet sitting here Still and silent as a statue Writing words Meaningless as the life lived

      Happiness is not for me I watch as a silent spectator  As it puts on its show Amusing people, exciting people Giving joy I sit in my lonely corner Hovering in the shadows Lest it spots me Happiness is not for me It never was meant to be Almost afraid of crying out loud I crouch even more tightly Afraid that I might run after it Try to make it mine And feel more much more pain in return Happiness is not for me Happiness will never be mine It is the privilege of a few Those who don’t even see it Those deprived of it feel its need Like a drop of water on a long desert ride
