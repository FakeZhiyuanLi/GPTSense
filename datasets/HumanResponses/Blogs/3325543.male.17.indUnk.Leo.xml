      Aha once again there is nothing to do so i am just sitting here thinking about turning on the tv and watching some adult swim and going to bed but that dosnt sound fun either so eh. Nothing happned today, just went to meijer with my sister and then came home and tried to mow but the god damn belt on the mower fell off again and now has streched so much its about two feet longer then what it sposed to be so that needs to be fixed and since i get paied tomorrow (Hopefully) the cost of the new belt will prolly come out of my pocket. Hell if i fix it up ou of my own money i should be able to take it with me when i move out ..... but you dont realy need a riding lawnmower when you live in an apartment due to the fact that i think they mow the grass for you (The whole maybe 8 square feet of grass you acctualy have). I don't realy know what im going to do with my paycheck yet, Its going to be around one hundred dollars so its not that much .... what could i buy for a hundred bucks: Awhole lotta mountain dew, Maybe a bike from like wallmart (Wich would be a good idea since then i could just ride to kristinas house whenever i wanted to), New speakers for my computer, a bunch of odor eater shit for my sandals (Yes they realy need like a case of it because they stink like rotting nasty stuff), Some new sandals, a new phone maybe (2 year contract or a sale), wow i guess that is alot of stuff i could buy that i thought of in like two min. Well im going to go dream about all the things i can buy maybe ..... then have the nightmare when i wake up at 10am and have to go to work in an hour heh.  ~Ryan~

      Yeah so far I still have no games on my computer yet and IM going crazy I need to do something. Today at 11 a.m. I have to go to McDonald's and look at my hours. Hopefully I wont work the rest of the week :D. Other than this there is nothing else to report. My room is a mess, I need to do laundry, im hungry sooooo I think im going to go out into the kitchen ......... Grab some peanut butter and some strawberry jam and put it on some bread and then come back to my room and lay down, eat it and go to sleep. I just woke up but I can prolly go back to sleep because IM bored as hell and ummmmm yeah im bored. Normally when im bored I would call kristina but I was just over at her house yesterday and it is 8:14 in the morning at the moment and yeah I don't think she would be to happy if I called and said I was bored :D so I will text message her phone muhahahahahahahahahahaha im going to do it now ......... bah son ova bitch verizon still hasn't reactivated my text messaging. Bastards I tell you, they said 5 to 6 hours and its been like 12. But I don't relay feel like calling *611 again and being put on hold for an hour but heh im gunna go make my sammich now and eat it and watch some TV because if your reading this right now ( 8:18 am Eastern Time ) you are either at school or at work and I am not because at the moment I don't go to school ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. No seriously I don't go to school now and my homeschooling wont be setup for awhile so HA stick that in your gas tank and burn it. I am so out of here its not even funny because I need to eat and then I need to smoke and then I need to watch TV. Funny thing is my mom just left and its just me and my dad and im gunna have to lock my door when I smoke and that sucks because if I forget to unlock it when im done and he tries to come in to yell at me for some random shit he will all start bangin on the door and twisting the knob like if he twists it hard enough it will come unlocked .... heh well yeah bangingnging out :D   ~Ryan~     Heh i just ran spell check and it fucked up my whole thing and i had to go back and change it but i prolly missed some but never again will i run bloggers spell check. Ya learn something new every day :D.

      Yes im so bored. I just re-formated my hard drive yesterday so i have no games installed and im to lazy to install them. To top that im positive POR won't work and im sick and tired of Age Of Empires and Grand Theft Auto Vice City. There is nothing for me to do and i have this urge to shoot something and i want to install Half-Life so i can play Firearms but i dont want to go through the instalation crap again, i mean it was all fine and dandy then they switched to the steam engine shit and its so fucking lame that it makes me not want to play anymore but i have this lust for violence that needs to be quenched. Even though since i havn't played Firearms in quite a long time and i have no doubt lost my elite skill and would die time after time and then get pissed off and start breaking things it would still be nice to play just so i can fucking shoot something and be like -= Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha i just shot you in your groin, DO YOU FEEL THE PAIN ..... WHOS YOUR DADDY BITCH =- or maybe im just being an idiot but who knows. One thing i want to do next week when i get my paycheck is take katie out so i can be with her, i miss her so much .... it's been so long since ive seen her. I think the last time i saw katie was months ago when me and a freind were aimlessly walking around in dollar general in wapak and on our way out i saw katie and i wanted to go hug her or something but i just kinda left and felt like an idiot for not doing anything but i talk to her on msn and thats sorta good but i wanna see her damnit. Im going to go do something but i don't know what at the moment but rest easy my underlings i shall find something to do wether its GTA or Firearms i will kill something ........... bye :D   ~Ryan~
