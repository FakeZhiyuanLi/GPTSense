      And forever we will be ...  Always have the best of times with all of you.  I guess some people will never understand the fact that good friends are hard to to find.    ONLY 13 DAYS  Can't wait. It is going to be so much fun.    Why do parents always seem to favor one child? Good one.  I try to stick up for myself and just dig a deeper hole. It's going to wind up killing me one of these days. I just don't know what to do anymore.   "You are older. You need to set the example. You should know better." Well, when is he ever going to learn to grow up on his own, without someone holding his hand every step of the way? When is he going to have to look reality straight in the face?  - I had to, every step I took .. I had no one's footsteps to follow in. I am digging my own path through life, and I think I am doing a pretty good job. Sure, I am hitting a few rough spots, but I can work just as hard, if not harder, to get through it.   When is he going to have to follow through on his own?   Daily Words of Wisdom ... Keep your head up, hold on strong.

      Where is it all going?  Haha ...Today was a good one.  But I am also so very very confused. Maybe I should just move on?  I miss you. Hanging out and just talking. I wish I could relive last summer forever. It was so much fun. The beach, hangin out downtown, or just talking to you was great. Why can't I seem to find that here? I always wonder if anything could ever happen between the two of us? But then again, you live so far away, it hits me.   "Great kid."

      Weird.  I am still friends with you. But there are just some times that I want to blow up. I can't stand it a lot of the time. I find one thing to be my own and you come along and join it. I thought this could be mine, but apparently you are barging in again. It's all for the love of the game.         I dont want to say anything to hurt your feelings. But what can I do?  I dont know how to tell you all of this. You just seem to keep getting worse and worse. I thought that now because we are in highschool you may understand.                      I was so wrong.  Why do you have to be so judgemental? Why can't I just be able to like someone or do something without an explanation? Why do you have to act like my parents?   Why do you have to be involved with everything, and then get jealous?  Why do you make me feel this way?

        Woah.    I always wondered what it would be like to have wicked cool friends. Then I came to highschool and found ones that I will never forget.   It's funny how sports bring out who you are going to spend the years with. Ever since field hockey and ice hockey .. I have realized who some people are.  I used to hate you last year. You remember. Now we are the best of friends.   We were never close. Now we are unseperable.   I guess I am just amazed at what things can change and what things will always stay the same. I guess this friendship is one of those things that no one can make go away.  I love you so much .. and I would never want anything to come between us. But there are somethings that we cannot help ourselves ... a funny little thing called  guys . I dont want this to ruin things .. I just want you to understand.

      Suddenly, I've been blinded in the eyes of reality.  Now it's feeling kind of awkward for me. I like you so much, and everything I have been yearning for has been fulfilled.            But... I guess I am still kind of thinking about that.  Most people find it hillarious. Some don't even care how it is affecting me. But none of them are in my shoes, having the constant question in the back of their head.                    I don't know. Maybe I'll just get over it.    As for Local Forecast ... that was friggen awesome.

      It's great to want something so much that you would live through the pain for an hour or two, just to be that much closer to it.  Field Hockey.  I dont know what it is about it, or what it does to us girls, but it's that certain something that keeps us pulling for more.   ... I dont know ... but I kinda like it ....

      So pumped for this weekend ladies.                Everything happens for a reason.   You know where I stand on all of this. You just need to tell him how you feel and I know that you dont want to hear it. I know you want to go back and change everything, or just that nothing happened at all. But it has happened and we can't change any of it now. I will always be here through thick and thin. You know that you can talk to me about anything. I will always be here to listen and if needed, to give advice. But I know that this is hard for you, but I think that you would feel so much better if you just tell him everything. I know that things are gonna be weird or he may say something you dont want to hear, but it has happened before. Maybe not to the same degree, but nothing may even happen at all. Well, I just wanted you to know that. And if you ever need anything, I'm here.  I luf you.    xo Phillip  Muah.

      I love it.   I love being with you.  I love just talking about anything.   I love the way you are.  I love how you understand why.  I love how you are who you are and don't care.  I love everything about you.  I'm so happy I'm with you.  Last night was great.  xo   GIRLS : Where would I be without you to break my wrist when we're scared out of our minds?  Where would I be without you to rub your clammy hands all over me?  Where would I be without our love/hate relationship?   Where would I be without you to talk to everyday and to scream out "WEEN!" in the halls? (with the weird looks from everyone)  Where would I be without your band jacket and huge boobs?  Honestly ... I have no idea where I would be without you girls. - Thanks .-

      Great.  Everythin seems to be going my way.  Except for the whole school thing.   I don't know what's happening. I have usually done pretty well, and then 2nd term rolled around, and I am doing pretty shitty.  Oh well, just gotta step it up I guess.  Everytime I see you in the halls, I get butterflies. Everything just feels so good.   I love it.

      I melt.  Everytime you look at me that way.  It never fails.   Anytime, anyplace.   This burn in me is the coolest thing.  I've ever felt.  I melt.    Everytime I'm near you, this feeling bubbles inside. The entire day. I can't stop thinking about you.  =)

      Tonight was the best time of my life. For those 5 seconds, time froze for eternity. I honestly can say... I havent been this happy in a long time.  =) x 12  HELL YEAH PATRIOTS!  Well, It's out in the open now.   I'm hoping you feel the same way that I do.   .... but then again it's so hard to tell.   It was a great time. Hanging out with you always is. Can't wait till that special night together. It's gonna be a doozy!

Life is good, for the moment.   Feeling happy.   And you probably could have guessed that I am home alone, without anyone to bother me. Which would explain the good mood.  oh yeah .. I love Popsicles!

      So I've just realized that it's been almost a month since I've had time to sit down and think to myself. ... Tomorrow will be the last day that I will see one of my best friends in the hallway. I am gonna miss those times where you would call me just to have someone to go to the mall ... or when you would save me from having to sit alone. Everything's about to change. And I dont know if I am ready to handle that. ... People always leave and then I eventually get over it .. this one's gonna be tough.   And then there are those people that you know are gonna be there forever, even though they might be one step ahead of you .. yeah ... you can always count on those people.

      How can you wait for heaven? When you've waited all this time .. And how can you keep your feet on the ground? When you know ... You were born to fly. -  Sarah Evans     Worked today. That sucked.   Sometimes when you just sit on your porch or like just outside, you can just feel like nothing else matters. All that matters is that one little moment in time when you are enjoying yourself. No one can bother you.    ..... and then you wake up.

      As the tears fell from my eyes on the ride home of which was supposed to be the "night of my life",  I realized that the people you can truly trust and have faith in are the ones that are there for you whenever you need them, not when  they  have time.   I dont know what people are thinking when they think that they have to be a totally different person when they are around other people besides just you. That really bothers me.   But ... other than the exception of one person .. I did have a really good time. I guess I just need to learn that there is always going to be one of those people in my life .. and I just need to learn to not let it bother me.   ... other than that .. I love my life.

      I've come to the decision that I am just going to be a little bit more passive in life. It makes things so much easier to just go with the flow, rather that just being pissed off at everything.  It's summer ...  fuckin' let it go already ...

      I'd sure hate to break down here.  Nothin' up ahead or in the rear view mirror. Out in the middle of nowhere knowin' I'm in trouble if these wheels stop rollin'. So God help me keep me movin' somehow. Don't let me start wishin' I was with him now.  I've made it this far without cryin' a single tear And I'd sure hate to break down here.  -  Julie Roberts   Heard that song for the first time the other day. It's good. Reminds me of someone, someone who I don't go a day without thinking about what we had together. Someone who I don't go a day without thinking about what he meant to me. But somehow we like to say that we've  moved on . We like to say that the other doesn't matter anymore, but deep down inside, we still care. We care a lot. It's funny how something can just be thrown away, after all of the effort and all the shit that it takes to make a relationship real. I don't know, I guess I just don't understand.   ..  on a pillow of blue bonnets and a blanket made of stars
