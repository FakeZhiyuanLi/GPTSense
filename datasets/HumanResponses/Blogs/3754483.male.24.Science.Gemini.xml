       I can't translate as the same as i wrote in portuguese (of course my vocabulary in portuguese is richest, 'cause is my maternal language, like french). Well, will be quitte difficult for me to write in french and dutch as the same time (for sure, will drive me nuts!). So, I set up my mind to write differents things in each language, however I really don't know if i'll keep in my mind the principal purpose when i writting in portuguese: discourse the social science and the humman behaviour. 	Sometimes i listennig a song of Dave Matthews Band, called Say Goodbye. In fact, i used to listened it every single day, and just right now. Once, i discovered tha real meaning for this song: CARPIE DIEM! Bigo!  Just look over the lyric: ________________________________________________________  Say Goodbye    (Dave Matthews Band)   So here we are tonight, You and me together The storm outside, the fire is bright And in your eyes I see What's on my mind You've got me wild Turned around inside And then desire, see, is creeping up heavy inside here And know you feel the same way I do now Now let's make this an evening Lovers for a night, lovers for tonight Stay here with me, love, tonight just for an evening When we make our passion pictures You and me twist up Secret creatures And we'll stay here Tomorrow go back to being friends   Go back to being friends But tonight let's be lovers, We kiss and sweat We'll turn this better thing To the best Of all we can offer, Just a rogue kiss Tangled tongues and lips, See me this way I'm turning and turning for you Girl, just tonight   Float away here with me An evening just wait and see But tomorrow go back to your man I'm back to my world And we're back to being friends Wait and see me, Tonight let's do this thing All we are is wasting hours until the sun comes up it's all ours On our way here Tomorrow go back to being friends   Go back to being friends Tonight let's be lovers, say you will And hear me call, soft-spoken whispering love A thing or two I have to say here Tonight let's go all the way then Love I'll see you, Just for this evening Let's strip down, trip out at this One evening starts with a kiss Run away   And tomorrow Back to being friends Lovers...love...lovers Just for tonight, one night...love you And tomorrow say goodbye ___________________________________________________ Over that, i invite you to discouver  what the Carpie Diem means. Welcome to the metaphisic area!

      	 Para ver como as coisas que acontecem na vida d'agente são tão surreais: Tantos desperamos em tentar compreender a mente dos outros, forçando-nos a ser indivíduos cheios de preconceitos e seres de caráter-predido,  transformando-nos em máquinas - literalmente em protótipos semelhantes - com vontades repreendidas. Em conseqüência disto, faz-se-á esfaceler nossa própria personalidade e multiplicando, fordismamente, Egos semelhantes e falsos Super-Egos; destruindo nossos desejos (mesmo que eles sejam obscuros - aí vem a questão: O que é obscuridade? Emana do Ser social ou do individual?). Escrevo isso com autoridade, não somente com uma opnião, mas como bacharel em uma cátedra social.  	Mas a vida recomeça: larguei de mão todas demagogias que via do possivel (mas também inevitável) futuro que me aguardava nesta áera. Aí veio na minha mente:  Carpie Diem!!!  Bingo! E recomeço a vida outra vez...
