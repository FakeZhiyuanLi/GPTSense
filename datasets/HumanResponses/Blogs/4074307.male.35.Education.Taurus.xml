      So I just read an article posted on Jewishworldreview.com yesterday entitled " Arab Guide to the 2004 Election"   by Steven Stalinsky.  For those of you who've never been to Jewishworldreview, it's great.  Obviously, it focuses on Jewish issues, but has some great authors offering all sorts of opinions.  You can even read Jackie Mason there.  Anyway, I digress.  The article reported what is being said by the media in places like Egypt and Iran.  Basically, they go one about how the President is a Nazi,  (which is ironic, because all these coutries sided with the Nazi's in WWII) and that the US better elect Kerry.  Well, that's enough for me.  Unlike most who are afraid to say it, these countries are the one sponsering the people who want to kill ALL americans.   And that includes Muslim americans.  That fact that they want the President out, and are going over the top to try to accomplish that shows that the President's policys are working.  No matter what side of the other issues we may be on, taxes, welfare, abortion, whatever, to paraphrase David Ben Gurain, what good is the debate if we're all dead!

      I seem to have a lot of random thoughts floating through my brain at various times. And I'm very, no make that VERY opinionated, so I thought I would try putting them to paper, well, virtual paper. So I will be commenting here on things of interest to me, such as politics (Vote Bush!!!), living in the People's Republic of NJ (thanks Governer McGreedy), sports (The Yankees are not evil, the rest of the owners are, and I can prove it!!) and whatever else comes to my brain in the middle of whatever I'm doing.    If you're reading this, thanks.  Hopefully I can come up with something thought provoking somewhere along the line.

      I really wish the media would stop refering to the Men's Olympic Basketball team as "The Dream Team."  They aren't.  Don't get me wrong, I fully support the team, but they aren't a Dream.  The only Olympic Basketball team that was a "Dream Team" was the first one, Magic, Michael, Larry et al.  That was a Dream team and could never be duplicated, no matter how hard USA Basketball tries.  Of course, they weren't the original Dream Team.  That was the 1980 US Hockey Team.  The way they won, and in the time it was, that was a grand Dream.  Watch the movie "Miracle"  I cry at the end every time!!!  If any team in this Olympiad is a "Dream Team" it's the US Softball Team.  They are now 7-0 and the top seed going into the Medal Round.  In four of the games, the mercy rule was invoked.  Oh, and by the way, the US team is yet to give up a run after facing the other seven teams in the competition.  Let me repeat that, NO ONE HAS SCORED AGAINST THE US TEAM!!!  So, in my opinion, they are the Dream Team, unless you have to face them, in which case they are the Nightmare Team.

      First of all, stop calling the USA Men's Basketball team the Dream Team.  They aren't.  There was only one basketball Dream Team, and that was the first one.  Magic, Larry, Michael and the others, that was a Dream.  But you know who the first Dream Team really was?  The 1980 Olympic Hockey Champs.  That was the Real Dream Team.   If you can call any team in this Olympics the "Dream Team,"  it's the US Softball team.  They're 6 and 0.  Four of the games were stopped by the mercy rule.  No one has scored against them.   Let me repeat that.  They haven't given up a run.  I guess for the rest of the teams, it's not a dream.  It's a nightmare.  On another note, today John Kerry once again accused the President of using a front group to attack him and has called on the President to condemn them.  I'm amazed, because Mr. Kerry has never, I repeat, NEVER, condemned George Soros or MoveOn.Org for comparing the President to Adolph Hitler.  They even put it in an ad of their own.  John Kerry didn't condemn it.  In fact, he hired the person behind the MoveOn.org ads to run his internet campain.  Mr. Kerry, what's the real reason you wan the Swift Boat ad taken off the air?

      Hi All,  Sorry I haven't posted but I was away all weekend.  I am making every attempt to  post three times a week.  This post will be combined.  First, on the Presidential Election front, John Kerry gave a speech to the VFW.  In the speech he told the crowed that the other Arab countries have a big stake in helping our efforts to create a democracy in Iraq, and that he was upset that they weren't "at the table."  Is he kidding, or is he really that clueless.  The Arab dictatorship have every stake in us NOT succeeding.  Our success is what they fear most.  Countries like Iran and Syria are among the worst dictatorships in the world.  Their people have little if any human rights.  These are the people who pay for, train, and support the terrorist who want to kill us.  Fact:  Excluding the Oklahoma City bombing, 83% of terrorists act against the United States in the past 20 years have been committed by Arabs.  The other 17%?  Converts to Radical Islam.  And John Kerry wants to be in charge of protecting us.  How can he if he doesn't even know, or acknowledge who are enemies are.  Hey John, Get a clue!!!  While I was away, Governor McGreevy made his announcement.  I give him credit for not waiting until he was under oath, and didn't lie about (unlike a former impeached President, who I won't name. )(Bill Clinton).   But a good friend of mine made a great point that I wish to share.  The only reason the Governor  "came out" was to get ahead of a scandal.  The truth is that the Gov has run a very corrupt administration since taking office, and as more and more info comes out, I think the more we as New Jersians will be p-o'd.   For example, on Monday, I found out that the Governor could have had Louis Freeh, the former FBI director as the NJ Director of Homeland Security, and the Gov passed.  And did I mention that he was going to work for free?  The bottom line is this isn't a gay issue.  That's irrelivent.  But the Governor violating the good faith of the people can not be.  And now he refuses to step down to keep the people of NJ from deciding his replacement, siting security reasons.  Give me a break.  Then we would have Louis  Freeh working for the state, the Governor would have attended a meeting with Governor Pataki of NY to be briefed on the current terror threat, and so on.  Hey Gov, do the right thing and step down now!

      We're no. 1, we're no 1.  Yes, that's right, once again the state of NJ is #1 in something we don't want to be.  Yesterday, it was annouced that NJ has had the highest per capita tax increases in the country under Jim McGreevy.  Thanks gov, I appreciate you stealing from me.  And it is stealing, why?  Because, according to the article I read in the Newark Star Ledger, the Governer hasn't seen fit to cut state spending at all.  Yep, no cuts, nada, nothing!!!!  It's weird.  When your budget doesn't add up you have two choices.  One, generate more income or two, cut expenses.  It amazes me how NJ ALWAYS increases spending, especially since they have NO WAY to generate income, other than raising taxes or borrowing money.  Oh, and they aren't supposed to borrow money.  That's the law.  The NJ State Supreme Court said so, well, sort of.  You see, they said it's ok this once, but the Governer shouldn't have done it and can't do it again.  There's upholding the law for you.  In the mean time, President Bush has also spent a lot of money.  I know he has, because it drives me crazy.  Don't get me wrong, I support the President whole heartedly.  110%.  But, I'm not a Kool-Aid (tm) drinker and I have no problem critizing the President when I think he's wrong and he has spent way to much money.  However, the Treasury department, or Finance dept, or the IRS, whoever count's Government revenue, I forget, recently annouced that government revenues on the Federal level increased last year, and quite signifigantly.  That's because the President LOWERED Taxes.  That's right.  And I thought I had the money to invest, and spend, and do the things that are really needed to make the economy move, only until Governer McGreevy stole it from to fund another program of which I will see no benifit.  And then he borrowed money to plow roads. Oh, and thanks to his borrowing, NJ's bond rating just went down.  So much for my NJ Bond fund.   I just think I'll my money in the swamps where the Governer can't find it.

      Hi All (If anyone is actually reading this!).  Not much going on here today, but I did just watch Bill O'Reilly verbally beat the crap out of some guy from the New York Times.  The one thing he could have burned O'Reilly on, he took from a known left wing web site.  Yeah, because what's written on the web is totally vetted and checked for facts.  Hell, I'm writing here!!!!!!!  Which leads me to the subject of reading, as usual.  Reading is a good way to learn different things from different points of view.  Even though I consider myself a conservative, I have read books by those on the left.  If you want to win, you need to know your enemy, isn't that what Tsun Tso (or however you spell it said) and found some of them quite enjoyable, especially Alan Colms "Red White and Liberal"  But I have to admit that I read a lot more "Right" books, pun intended.  I am currently reading "Bush Country" by John Podhoretz and just finished "the Official Handbook of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy."  Both are very enjoyable, quick reads which I highly recommend.  Next I will be reading Dennis Hasterts book.  Here are some other politically oriented books that I highly, highly recommend: "Let Freedom Ring" and "Deliver Us From Evil" by Sean Hannity "Who's Looking Out For You", "No Spin Zone" and "The O'Reilly Factor" by Bill O'Reilly "The Death Of Right and Wrong" by Tammy Bruce  (Great, great book that exposed a lot of what's wrong with liberal social policy) "A National Party No More" by Senator Zell Miller  (another great, quick read)  If you've read any of these, let me know what you think.  And please, anything you can recommend is very appreciated.

      Dear Congressman,  I receiveed today's Washington update where you call for an "END TO THE POLICIES HURTING ECONOMIC GROWTH."  In the message you call for an end to tax the tax cuts that our Govenor has already stolen from us. Why don't you call for a reduction in goverment spending and waste instead of taking more money from MY pockets.  Remember, it is MY money, that I worked hard to earn, that you are spending.  All the government has done has take it from me in taxes.  Sincerely, Marc J. Fleischner Berlin, NJ.

      Yesterday was a very interesting day. You see there's this group of Vietnam Veterans who've produced a commercial stating what they feel about John Kerry's service while fighting the war. You mean you didn't hear about it? It was all over the news. It wasn't? Doesn't the media report all the major news in an unbiased way? RIGHT, as long as your a democrat it does. By several reports that I heard on talk radio, caller, just like you an me, reported that the major news networks reported on all of the events of the day, except the commercial. So much for reporting the news. They were especially spending time on the artist who are performing in concert to raise money to support John Kerry. Bruce Springsteen was talked about a lot. I have to admit, I was always a Boss fan, being from NJ, and always took his rants in stride, because they were on specific issues and he's allowed his opinion. What scares me is this new Bruce, who has turned into a political hack and is helping to advance the lies that many Democrats and Democratic supports are spreading. Bruce spent a lot of time talking about how Joe Wilson discovered that the President lied about Saddam trying to get materials for nuclear weapons. Of course, now we know that Wilson lied, so where's the apology from Bruce? No, no apology, only a change of partisan rhetoric that really is going to cost all of these artists in the long run. Most of these people haven't had a real job in the last 20 years, so what do they know about the issues that really affect us. But, they have a right to speak, so I will let them. As I said it will only hurt them in the long run. But here's the kicker. Yesterday lawyers from John Kerry's campain and the DNC sent a letter to television stations that basically threatened them if they ran the add from swiftvets.com.   He then called for the President to condemn that add.  Huh, so much for free speech.  I wonder why Kerry didn't condemn George Soros or Moveon.org when they lied?  Maybe because he only believes the Speech is free when it's supports him?

      Well, I'm feeling a little under the weather today, so I thought I would take a few minutes to post a book review, since I haven't been paying attention to today's events.   Reading is one of the many gifts my late Mom gave me.  She did everything she could to get me to read and I just wouldn't do it until she gave me Casino Royal by Ian Flemming.  From there I read every Flemming Bond book I could get a hold of and have branched out from there.  Lately, I've gotten into political books (suprise suprise!!!!)  and historical/ historical fiction.  I've even added a small bookcase to hold all of the books I have on "My Pile" to read.  Today I want to actually talk about two books by Herman Wouk called "The Hope" and "The Glory."   The books trace several families from the creation of Israel through to almost the present day.   It took me no time at all to get through these books, with Wouk's prose making it feel as though I was living next door to the families in the story.  Anyone who  reads these books will understand the trials and tribulations Israeli's face every day and have a new respect for the country that is home to the  some of the most important archeological sites in the modern world1

      I'm sitting here watching the O'Reilly factor and Bill is interviewing the First Lady.  What a difference from what we've scene with Teresa Kerry.  Mrs. Bush comes off as a very educated and classy person.  I have a lot of respect for her and the things that she has accomplished.  I think I would love to sit and talk with her as much as I would like to sit with her husband, President Bush.  Contrast that with Mrs. Kerry.  I have to admit, some of the things she has said has made me laugh, but whenever I here her speak, I feel like I'm at the local pub.  Her supporters would just say that I don't like strong women.  If that was true, I wouldn't like Mrs. Bush.  Unfortunately, I get the feeling from  Mrs. Kerry that because she has a lot of money she thinks she can say or do what ever she wants, and I guess that's the heart and sole of the matter.  Modesty vs. arrogance.  And it's that's arrogance from both Mrs and Mr Heinz (I mean Kerry) that's going to return the President to the White House!

         Dear Sirs,               I sat watching last week's Democratic convention and had to laugh, because I thought I heard Republicans talking with just a few exceptions.    Where were the real Al Gore and Ted Kennedy?    Their speeches were far different than the rants and raves that they have been giving in speeches prior to the Convention.    John Edwards gave an excellent speech, but it was filled with class warfare rhetoric that is not helpful to the countries future.    Finally, John Kerry spoke, and he also gave an excellent speech full of great slogans.    And that's the problem; all I really know about John Kerry is that he hates President Bush and that he wants to raise taxes.    He says he has plans, but won't tell us what they are.    Whenever you question his voting record in the Senate, he says you are questioning his Patriotism.    I don't, I question his policies, because when you hear them I am sure that you will come to only one conclusion in this election, and that is to re-elect President Bush.               Thank you,       Marc Fleischner     (Thank you to John Lyden for his editing skills!)
