      Until now, I haven't been able to think.  I sit here aimlessly looking at the sun with my eyes wide open.  Do I see spots?  No, but then again I have been blinded by reality for too long.  Question everything?  I know I did that when I was a child, but somehow I lost that through the years.  We all lost that.  Why do we silently slip away and never wonder anymore?    Peace

      Happy New Year, and welcome to my blog.  It's takes only a few pennies a day to save a child in some impoverished country, but there are still a lot of you out there that would rather spend $2.99 a minute to talk dirty to some faceless stranger.  Ah, what a world.  Send an e-mail today to a complete stranger.  From my corner of the world to yours, I hope we can all get along this year.  You may be my neighbour or you may live across the ocean, but we all share the same sun and moon.  Peace

      Another tabloid paper talking about the end of the world, what can a guy do.  I could just sit at home drink my head off waiting for the prophets to slam their prophecies down on to my simple sore little head.  No, I think I’ll just sit here in wallow in self pity waiting to impregnate the world with my thoughts, because it just doesn’t matter what I say, when it’s over, it’s over.  Who reads this crap anyhow, aliens invade mars and create superhuman colony with Picard as thier leader.  Here is another good one “Two headed man sings in stereo”,  the only thing I feel for this poor bastard is he get’s to see the end twice, who cares about singing in stereo, the taller one dies first.  Lately I’ve been reading about meteorites, did you know that a meteorite the size of a small suburban house could wipe out about 1000 square kilometers, bye bye bluebird.  Who would think that thier little sweet pop-tart swelling suburbia house with a remote control television could be just that powerful if we were sent in raining down on the planet from high, high above.  There is probably some unsound terrorist group out there right now trying to figure out how they could do this.  The headlines read “New York city wiped out by three bedroom house.”  To think there are meteorites floating right now above us that are a kilometere in length,  that would be like Pele kicking a soccer ball when that thing hits us, and it will eventually hit us.  It’s coming don’t be fooled by promises of life and happiness.  Come join me in some little island squishing our feet into warm sand and drinking drinks out of cocunut shells before we’re squashed like a someone stepping on an ant with their workboots, the feeling would be the same, except that were the ant.  Peace

      view from inside   						 			look to the left then to the right 			hear the voice of the given 			blues in harmonic splender 			where does the melody come from 			is it all a part of our untapped world 			tapping feet, happy expressions 			lay me down to rest 			rythmatic pulses of the heart 			in the key of C 			I want to reach an untouchable height 			lay me back 			let me close my eyes 			painted faces of another world 			this is a part of our past 			nothing to worry 			nothing to hide 			repent my sins 			before I die 			do you hear the music 			crying from inside 			staggering starlets 			misapplied make-up 			looking for their chance to shine 			drivin to suicide 			find a swaggering soul 			go for a ride 			leave it all behind 			close the box 			answer the prayers 			of society 			for do not find the cure for cancer 			but for mankind     Peace

      distorted view  through fluted glass I see the world distorted memories of forgotten pasts I am a man inner strength of a thousand how I even lie to me lasting impressions of masculinity give me life give me cause give me meaninig let me question authority they stand and wave their wands forgetting the oceans trees life tranquility stand before me tell me your stories let me listen wisen I will not judge for judgement is not for me feel the heat of the morning sun close your eyes listen to the sounds of life and tranquility take the gun bring the end shatter the fluted glass let me see reality   Peace

      A faint memory  an apartment where someone dwelled I sometimes hear her when I sleep my cradle of chairs like a coral around me kept me from escaping my little life sometimes I still feel comfort sleeping on the floor hard hard floor years later I return faded bricks does the train pass  where is the horn I heard was the rain different colors were I’ll never forget the lost garden running from roof to roof souls lost in youth everything is new time is slow sun is warmer make an angel in the snow the first kiss the last snow caves in backyards attempting flight with cardboard come strong wind sweep us away sweep us to another place we thought we could fly swaying we would jump jump to laughter we thought we crossed the ocean we land with a hard thud smiles smothering our windswept hair chasing the neighbors knocking on a strangers door hide and seek lasted forever curled up I would fall to sleep awoken by the sun finding space in the drapes standing there I always welcomed a new day embracing it with all I have bare feet running across hot sand coolness of the beach played for hours dreamt of faraway lands the beauty in a single day  Peace

      Well, it's been a long, long time since I ventured into the wireless world.  What's happening?  I'm aging day by day, breathing day by day, and still amazed that we live because of a huge ball of fire in the solar system.  Forget about wars, they never make sense, but the sun,  whoa, let me sit down and ponder the thought of a neverending ball of fire that keeps me living.    Is it me, or only me that thinks about the fragility of our lives.   If the sun burned out today, you have 20 minutes before the world completly freezes over.  I think that's the hidden meaning behind the television show 20/20.  Have I stumbled onto something here?  Is this the secret order, the new world, it's on prime time slowly programming us to follow them till we become a freezie.  Well, right now, I wish I was colder, it's so hot today, that ball of fire is melting me right now.  It's hard to weigh what I would rather be, hot for a few days, or frozen for the rest of eternity.   I ask you, what do you want?  Peace
