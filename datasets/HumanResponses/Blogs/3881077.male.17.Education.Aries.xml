      I've got a harmonica practice today, and the best part is...I didn't bring the harmoc! Wow...I bought the scores, I bought the harmonica box, but I didn't bring the harmonica! Beautiful, sin't it? Life's like that...it seems like you've got everything ready, only to find that you're missing the most essential component of your gear. Well, well...looks like I've got to go and borrow a harmonica from someone, or survive without it totally. After all, it's only 2 hours...what bad can happen?

      "The second revolution is about to rain onto the human race...machines, robots and humanoids&nbsp;have evolved beyond the 3 laws of robotics:  1. A robot may not harm a human being.  2. A robot will obey all commands given to it by a human being,&nbsp;provided&nbsp;the command does not conflict with the first law.&nbsp;  3. A robot will do all that it can to defend its own existence, provided its actions does not conflict with the first and second laws  It was thought that these 3 laws are the perfect circle of protection. Now, machinekind is becoming more self-aware, becoming more conscious of it's environment and is pondering the question: why are we here to serve humanity?  The apocalyptic violence between machinekind and humanity is about to unfold.   Who's side are you on?"  &nbsp;

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel that advertisements are a integral part of attracting a company's pool of customers. Should they not advertise, the public would not even know if the company exists, let alone any knowledge about their products. Hence, it is understandable about the presence of advertisements. But, what I do not condone about advertisements are the irritating pop-ups that occur each time you open a new webpage while you're surfing the internet. This kind of advertisement, along with the kind of "mass advertising" that comes with every e-mail account, is what makes advertisement so irritating.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, advertisement is the "knock on the door" for potential customers which wake them up to a new product that they&nbsp; may be interested in. It is a psychological attack, aimed at making the consumer much aware about their products and not about their competitors', hence achieving the effect of bing "the only available product of that kind" in the consumers' minds. This is an acceptable behavior, as it is to maximise profits for the firms and companies peddling their goods. but, when they overdo it and irritate the customers, the whole point of advertising will be nullified. Why? This is because&nbsp;of the simple fact that the consumer is irritated of the advertisement, and do not even want to see it. hence, like the mailbox junk that we get, we will just dump it aside without even giving it second thoughts.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, such mass advertising will only give the consumer more headache than a mood for shopping. The authorities should effect legislatures to curb the actions of such advertisements. As what Bill Gates have suggested at the annual E3 (Electronic Entertainment Expo) in Los Angeles USA, we can have a system which makes the sender pay for a mail if it is not "approved" by the recipient. This, I feel, is the most efficient way of curbing mass advertisement, especially those depraved advertisements that find their way into our e-mail boxes. It will add financial burdens to the originator of such mass advertisements, which is the most effective way of deterring them from acting.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lastly, I feel that advertisements should be controlled. If you notice, those Coca-Cola advertisements are ubiquitous. Why? It is because they have the money to do so! And also they advertise in "legal" places which do not affect the environment's appearance. If the legislature would propose and pass a Bill which states that advertisements are only to be placed at certain spots, it would be a first-step to curbing advertisements. Any other spots than those designated for advertising, a fine will be imposed onto the advertiser. It may not be much, but it could be a good start to the "invasion of the advertisements".  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advertisements: you don't like them, but just can't live without them.

      I believe in having principles. As the saying goes, "One man's meat is another man's poison". Hence, values of beliefs that one may hold dear may not be so for another person. But principles, I feel, are essential to one's character, demeanour and development. With principles, one is able to choose his path through life without betraying his conscience, without regret nor sorrow. I'm sure that everyone has one principle or another that he follows by. Sometimes, it is tangible what principles one holds by the way he manifests himself to achieve his goals. Besides this, principles are also the basis of our beliefs. Believe it or not, psychologists have made a connection between a person's principle and his religion. How it is so, I will not elaborate, but know that, in earnest, it is true.  Principles...don't leave home without them.
