      Ayarrk!! I'm sleepy! Need rest. I haven't had any sleep last night. Thanks to my housemate who was on the phone till near 4.00am in the morning. I didn't sleep because if I go to sleep then he won't be able to enter the house. Locked. And also, this is all because of a concern for a friend.   W/ Us. Fadzil: He couldn't find out where he put the specs for the website. Dateline is on April 11th, 2002.

      Ah well.... my students are still a long way from understanding Linux. They don't even know how to properly issue a Linux command yet. One thing for sure, in every session, they're all chitchatting and laughing the whole time. Duh....

       Mixed Version  I was thinking of making this blog a bilingual blog. Ouch! Out of my mind please! I'll rant in any language I want okay. I can rant in English, Manglish, Malay, or local dialects. Teeheehee...   Anyway.. just now Us. Fadzil called me: asking me to help build a website for his school. Insya Allah. I'll help but I'm not really sure about the design yet. Got to check a few samples agaknya.

      Today's menu:  self-made nasi lemak   Welcome back!   Two days offline. Yesterday... actually the plan was to go to Batu Feringghi but it changed to  ABIMPP - Regenerasi .  Baset was around, visited our new house, and had dinner with us yesterday. Long time no see. Long time no hear. There were lots of things we talked about. Forget the old days. Welcome dawn.  Today's story: Lina and Unie, both are in Penang today but I wasn't able to see them. Lina called around 1.40pm. Too,  late. Otherwise, I might be able to make twists to my timetable today. It's okay gals. Next time okay.  A collegue of mine, Chan Shing Yu has been admitted to hopital. No, he's not infected by SARS. I went to the hospital to visit him just now. Wow! What a beauty! Tak sangka ada nurse cun giler kat Penang Adventist Hospital, the place I went just now. It's now 8.08pm and there're still a lot students who hasn't arrived yet. The situation is getting worse.

      Hi again everyone. Such a long while since I last put a post here. I'm quite busy lately.. with lots of things to do. Coming soon...  more and more busy days. I'm gonna start my FlashMX-based e-learning project next week, together with another two or three partners and companions. It would be an intense three-month project I'm not really sure about my rest after this.  I'm planning to get a laptop/notebook soon. Maybe by next week. Any suggestion?

This weekend, I'm going to Kelantan, to visit my aunts, grandpa, and also a new friend of mine there, whom I met in IRC. Dunno what'll happen later but insya Allah I'll go see her.

      Wow! I was really surprised and excited at the same time to know that the one time very popular Saga Artakusiad (a fantasy/fiction series by Ahmad Patria Abdullah) will be printed out again. No. Not the old Book 1 to Book 6. The book that will be published (currently from what I read, is still on the way) is Book 7. Never been published before. But the sad thing is, there's no reprint for the previous 6 books.  urlLink Search for Saga Artakusiad using Google.  You'll be very pleased. Ah... I'm a big fan of the series. Yay!

I compiled it with my Duron 1200+ machine at it takes about an hour to finish.  The time's enough for you to wait for the pizza guy outside and have a chat with the girl next door.

      Nad, thanks. It was nice talking to you, tho I didn't expect you could be that sharp to guess about the card. I am okay. I am really okay, but I have to admit it left an impact on me somehow. I'm not really sure how to explain about the impact. She's not mine for a long time already. So, nothing should happen actually. Furthermore, I was expecting the card too.  It's kinda weird, isn't it?

      Jam 7.40pm. Selepas Maghrib. Rintik-rintik hujan baru sahaja berhenti apabila aku tiba di perkarangan rumah selepas ia turun buat beberapa ketika. Agak lewat aku tiba di rumah hari ni kerana Didi beria-ia nak bertemuku. Janji asal untuk bertemunya pada hari Ahad nanti dibatalkan. Ada perancangan lain, katanya.  Seakan ada gamitan dari peti surat, membawa aku kepadanya.   Ah.. memang ada surat rupanya. Sampulnya seolah-olah kukenali. Apa tidaknya, suatu ketika dahulu sampul surat sebegitu rupa selalu bertamu kepadaku. Detik jantung seakan bertambah pantas walaupun kehadirannya memang dalam jangkaan -- walaupun tidak sepenuhnya. Sebenarnya, tidak kujangkakan secepat ini aku menerimanya.  Di bahagian belakang sampul surat tertera satu nama yang amat biasa bagiku suatu ketika dulu; yang sebenarnya sudah agak lama tidak kusebut. Aku menjangkakan sekeping kad di dalamnya tetapi dari luar ia seakan sekadar setebal sekeping kertas yang biasa digunakan untuk menulis surat.  Baru tadi kusebut berkenaan kisahku sepanjang dua tahun lebih ini kepada Didi, adikku. Biarlah buat sementara ini aku sendiri dulu. Masih banyak persediaan yang perlu kubuat. Biarlah cuma sekali yang gagal. Aku tidak mahu ia berulang. Ala.. kalau susah-susah pun... ambil aje adik sendiri nanti; Didi kan ada. Aku berseloroh dengan Didi. Tak sangka pulak sesuatu yang kusebut-sebutkan sudah tiba rupanya.  Benar. Di dalamnya sememangnya terdapat sekeping kad. "Walimatul Urus" tertera dalam tulisan rumi, begitu juga dua nama yang amat biasa bagiku (walaupun kini ia hampir-hampir menjadi 'taboo' buatku). Kebetulan pula rakan serumah -- Man, Haidi dan Bi'in -- sedang duduk berbincang selepas solat di ruang tamu. Kulayangkan kad yang belum kubaca tadi kepada Man sambil tersenyum. Biarlah dia yang membacanya dulu. Aku lebih rela membacanya selepas dibaca oleh rakan-rakan yang lain.  ---  Dahlah... malas nak sambung. Kalau aku sambung, nanti aku masukkan sebagai komen kat dalam ni....

      This is a Linux update. I have a friend who's apparently a Linux nerd. Sort of, I might say. He made a Linux patch... a great Linux patch. You better try it out, provided you're into grid computing. What's good about this patch is that it is based on the work of  urlLink Eduardo Pinhiero's checkpoint patch , which actually works if you are still using kernel 2.4.2, but made possible to work for Linux kernel 2.4.22 by  urlLink Nur Hussein's port of epckpt .  I can't comment much tho, because I don't use my PC for grid computing. Just not yet. :P

      About slightly less than 3 months to go. Today is the last day for my class to finish the second module, Networking Essentials. My students are using SSH with enthusiasm. There was a major problem just now tho, they keep shutting down others' PC. It has been rectified, together with some added enthusiasm to learn more about Linux... hopefully.

      I wanna have time for myself too.  What was planned for me is different. It looks like the company's taking away my time this weekend. Weekend:    Saturday: work from 9am to 6pm. Finish the ICT modules, ICT training (as if I don't know what to teach), etc.    Sunday: Jaga booth masa exhibition. I hate this. I really hate this.   Saturday (my own plan that has been taken away): See my sister, Didi.   Sunday (my own plan that has been taken away): Kayak!       What to do now?

       Found Nemo   Hey... I've bought Finding Nemo at last -- DVD version. Everything's great. The picture's beautiful. The story's really fun and touching at the same time. Unlucky me tho, got some reading error near the end of the movie. I bought two other stories, in VCD form. One is just okay, despite poor picture quality, I still can watch the movie. A new movie. A pirated VCD. What to expect? Of course poor quality pictures. The other VCD was supposedly a Thai movie but it doesn't seem to work. Dammit!  A housemate's a little bit confused, I guess. It looks like I ain't myself buying movies. Just not like me. Not like the usual me. I don't complain. It's just once in a blue moon. So, sometimes we have to walk out of the shell too, right?

      Long time no write. Sorry guys. I've been trying frustratingly to update the blog but the connection here is excruciatingly slow.  At the same time, I almost have no time to think of what to write here. There're times where I just log in, as if I were about to write something but in the end there's no output at all.  Life's been fair.  Yesterday, I worked like a cow; from 9am up till 10pm.  That's lecturing alone. Not counting the meeting that I had after that.  My first thought was :  tired   I was tired untill I knew inside the new LSA class I was teaching last nite, there were four OSS users (Linux/FreeBSD). That rejuvenated me.    I went to KL last Saturday. Wanna know my comment?  STRESSFULL!  Hopefully I won't be living in KL later on. Imagine, just to take a U-turn, I had to travel for miles!

       urlLink I want to quit - friendly weblog   hello. my moodswing masih tak betul lagi... PMS kot. gegege.... i switched off my mobile... from Saturday, May 8... till today. Switch on pun sekadar nak baca SMS & voice mail. I even changed the 'offline message' to something else... yg lebih 'memuaskan hati'. Bukan apa.... tak larat nak layan service call. Jap-jap ada call itu la... call ini la.... Unluckily.. I did (terpaksa suatu ketika dulu) bagi phone number kat orang (not my friends circle) and jadinya terpaksa pulak menjawab panggilan dan bergayut kat house phone for hours.  I'm tired. I'm tired with a life I once chose. I'm tired with something I'm now stuck with. I'm tired of running away jugak.  Memang boleh dikatakan tengah running away jugak ni. I ingat nak tukar bidang lak la... agak-agaknya ada can tak I keluar dari bidang komputer yg selama ini menjadi darah daging ni? Lemaknya dah pejal. Kolestrolnya dah sukar dipecah-pecahkan. Dan bila dah berlemak... orang lain pun akan seolah-olah menambahlemakkan lagi.  I know what my weakness is. I tak sampai hati nak refuse permintaan orang. That killed me... and I died several times because of that.  One example... Ada orang offer me to join this one company.. sbg partner. Paid-up (as of now) capital company 50K (only) and I akan ada kepentingan 49%... and I don't have to fork out a penny. There're conditions tho.... I've to sell my soul. No other commitment. I'll not be free anymore. What's money? To some people... it's half (not part) of their lives, some... even more. Me? I'd rather give 'em out to get my freedom... but... it's hard to refuse ppl whom had befriend me. This guy's 47y-o and he treats me as his peer. (He's a Chinese by the way.) I didn't think it'd be this much of a condition. Dammit. It's not the money yg I susah hati... it's the relationship that has been built before. He insisted with his condition. Kalau I refuse, I rasa I'd lose a friend. I lost a lot already and I don't want to add another. :(  If I'm gonna leave this... I know I should also leave my current job, my anything that's related to this guy in any way. Even a software development environment+computer language will be placed in my dustbin of life. People tends to ungkit this and that. I feel the flame already when I told him that it's crazy if I have to give all my time for him. I have 24-hours a day, 1 head, a pair of both hands and feet. I can be at one place at a time only.... and all for this?   I sold my soul to the devil? Tell me... did I?

      [mood: hazy] [listening to: Simple Plan - Perfect] [current project: barcode scanner terminal interface]  I was digging an arcane vault just before my working hours ended today. Wow!  There're actually lots of things which I haven't discovered in the room next to mine. Lots and lots of barcode scanners, optical fibre network devices, SCSI adapters, primitive notebooks, etc etc. The list goes on and on. Nobody's going to use 'em except me... if I want to.  So, I took a few SCSI cards + a hard disk to begin with. This is enough to keep me entertained for a week, before I move on to a new game with the treasures.  Pity. They just bury the treasure. Lucky. I am the one who went there digging them out. :)  What a lucky day.

       urlLink Google Search: define: exhausted   Dear ye,  I arrived back home at 3.15 in the morning last night. I've never made such record before -- burning the last of the candles that I have for the whole night. Yeah.. I am quite used to sleeping late but staying up late at home is different from  staying up late at work. Man... it's really exhaustive. Previously, I stayed up to 2am and I was already exhausted. Now.. much more than that.   Result:   I didn't go to work today.    What's more. The core of the payroll software is actually a shit. It doesn't work. Tho I had to modify lots of things to move the data from our Time Management System into the software; modify a lot more to make sure there's no error halting the calculation process; but still the most sinful error is the process itself. Man.... actually it churn out errors. The total's wrong. How could it be said as "WORKING"?   DAMMIT!!!

The bolt reminds me I was there  The bolt reminds me I was there   If only I could turn back time  If only I had said what I still hide  If only I could turn back time  I would stay for the night   f only I could (if only I could, if only I could)  If only I could (if only I could, if only I could)  If only I could turn back time...   I'm in the brink of losing someone. Darn.  Ah well... if you could read this. Am I too technical?

      [mood: workaholic] [listening to: the hisses of the air-cond] [current project: find tunes]  This is a link to a 9/99 Linux Journal entry. It's  urlLink A Conversation with Craig Burton about Business Prospects for Linux . It's a good neutral read for both Linux and Microsoft Windows lovers. As for me, I post it here to make sure I'd be able to access the page later, just in case I forget the location.

      [mood: undetermined] [listening to: sounds of keyboard clicks] [current project: writing blog]   Heh... It was a chaotic day on Friday, as I was informed by colleagues, when the payroll system failed. All the blames went to everywhere except  /dev/null . Heh It was too, a day which I wasn't around to get the flames. It was pointless for me to be there tho, where all I can get are punishments of the sins I didn't make. But then, I was too, one of the people who had to be held liable of all the wrongs. Darn programmer! Darn the program! Darn everything else!  As of today, lots of employees didn't show up. They're like this,  urlLink complainants . It's 7th of the month and they're already complaining like shit as if they didn't get the pay for months. When I was with former employer, we are used to late pays. It's normal for us to receive our paychecks after the second week of the month, yet we're still grateful. It's not that we're too  urlLink complaisant , but we understand the  urlLink circumstances  faced by the people of the payroll.  Me? I did not intentionally  urlLink absentiate [ hackword... no definition ]  myself from work back then. I know. I have my responsibility. And... I also know, the limit of my body. I'm prone to rain-enabled disabilities. Heh... that's the term I coined up just now. It's a group of syndromes caused by polluted rain. As for me, the result is, I'd find myself unable  to wake up... err... collapsed, without even a dream.  Thanks to increased  urlLink susceptibility  to acidic rain.   Today's a working day again... and here I am... at a place I now  urlLink despise . Hahaha....  I'm counting to my day of  urlLink extinction .   PS:   I'm in the mood to place definitions of the words I use. Lucky t you.

      An email from Nad... a great story,indeed.    From:  To:  Subject: Great Story..... Date: Tue, 15 Jun 2004 11:10:20 +0800       The Mayonnaise Jar   When things in your life seem almost too much to handle, when 24 hours in a day are not enough, remember the mayonnaise jar... and the coffee...   A professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls.   He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was. So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles rolled into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.   The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with an unanimous "yes."   The professor then produced two cups of coffee from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed.   Now," said the professor as the laughter subsided, " I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things - your God, family, children, health, friends, and your favourite passions - things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, and your car. The sand is everything else - the small stuff.   If you put the sand into the jar first," he continued, "there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out to dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal."   Take care of the golf balls first, the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand." One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented.   The professor smiled. "I'm glad you asked. It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem, there's always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend."   Hope you are smiling now!

      [mood: i'm hungry] [listening to: my own voice] [current project: server setup]  Today is quite a pleasant day. Tho there're still problems with the work I'm doing, I am making a significant progress today. Alas, there's still a problem tho, which is still stuck in my mind. Yeah. People to people communication. I am just not good at that. It's such a trouble to convey my message, I guess     Can you see the picture here? Is there me inside? Ahahaha. I am missing from the picture, but it's one of the scene that amused me. It really was.  Come to think of it, maybe it's better for me to be missing in everyone else's scenes as well, so that no trouble comes from me at all.   Darn. I'm losing myself here. I could be missing from my own life.    if i can get back a friend by letting go half of my life i'd do that if that's what i've to pay i'd pay just dont take a friendship away i've already lost a lot i've lost a lot  i feel so terrible it was like i am the one... "a friend that's drifting away".   don't you wanna have the continuation of the lines of words?  i do, but it hurts even just by thinking, it does hurt even by reading, i'm hurt  thanks for reminding me and i still am with thee tho i feel you're drifted apart a friendship is still in my heart   I'd value friendship to my very best. But I am still not ready for more than that. I can be anyone's best friend (No... I'm not a dog, please) yet I am always at a distance. Sorry. I don't have any intention to break anyone's feeling. I'd try, if I could, to set the part which involves  deep feeling  aside but then, I am just a cretin on the face of the earth. Limited to whatever thing I can do, not every wish comes true.  I'm quite out of time now. People comes and go in my life. The same goes for me. I might be just another temporary stop in anyone's life.  Some people may just become more significant than the others. I may too.  I don't want to remember.  I don't want to forget. I am missing... in my own thinking.

Special-friend is not in the list yet. - I'm ego, yeah. And I'm not melt.  :( :( :(

      [mood: grateful. i feel blessed] [listening to: my heart]    Chorus  Ult li albi bissaraha (I'm opening up my heart with honesty)  Hayya nab'idil karaha (Let’s avoid the hated and hatred)  Syakkireena a' kulli ni'ma (Let's remain thankful with what we have)  Ba' ideena anil fattana (Let's avoid all lies and sins)    Verse 1  I feel the heat  From these 4 candles burning  As I'm staring out the window  In solitude I look at life  From different angles  Thoughts strangled  My mind is suffocatin'  In this truth quest  A greed law  That we abide by is ruthless  Enough will never satisfy  Until we toothless  Filthy millionaires  Are gamblin' until they muflis  A sad fact of life  But mankind approved this  I gotta call Him  Sajadah is where the booth is  I'll make it clear that  I ain't even tryin' to preach here  By sharing thoughts I hope  To find a little peace here  I thank Allah for blessing me  To be creative  So here's a diss for me  For bein' unappreciative  Wanted a perfect life  Yeah smile then die old  Fame, money, women  Phat cribos and white gold  Drive my own Beemer  Before I hit two six  A straight pink bitin' toothpicks  Who walk around town wit' two chicks  And doin' new hits to woo tricks....  Now that's wrong  Pleasure from partyin'  And bull ish don't last long  A lotta yuppies sneakin'  Cars out when dad's gone  Crackin' bottles in clubs  Frontin' designer fashion  But I ain't about  To trade happiness for a Jag  So stop smilin' with your ragtop down  Cause for a fact  I don't care about your money  Or how slick your car  'Cause no matter how rich and big you are  It's still Allahuakbar...    Chorus  Ult li albi bissaraha (I'm opening up my heart with honesty)  Hayya nab'idil karaha (Let’s avoid the hated and hatred)  Syakkireena a' kulli ni'ma (Let's remain thankful with what we have)  Ba' ideena anil fattana (Let's avoid all lies and sins)    Verse 2  I know that all this  Ain't the right thing  Partying, chasing moneys  And material things  Flying high  Think nobody gonna  Clip my wings  I'm lying to myself  Knowing that  I've been neglecting  Responsibilities  As a healthy Muslim  Riches and loot  Ain't nothing  We frontin'  Diamonds and scrilla  But forget to say  Alhamdulillah  Made my album a killer  Plan B  Now 2-3 droppin'  And I wish to  Ask for forgiveness  Your guidance  Protection and strength  For humbleness and faith  To make me a better man  Success in foreign lands  Never dreamt of that  I remember being 18  When we started Too Phat  Now let's go back  Three years before that  Sometimes I forget  Me and my parents  Took a trip with granddad  I remember '95  While performing Umrah  Made my wish in Mecca  Right in front the Kaabah  Dear God  You made it possible  When facing obstacles  Please let me do good  Before I pass on  In the hospital  And keep reciting  The Testimony of Faith  And find the right way  Out of this life's maze    Chorus  Ult li albi bissaraha (I'm opening up my heart with honesty)  Hayya nab'idil karaha (Let’s avoid the hated and hatred)  Syakkireena a' kulli ni'ma (Let's remain thankful with what we have)  Ba' ideena anil fattana (Let's avoid all lies and sins)    Verse 3  Ay yo…  Two candles go out  That's when  I feel the wind blow  I haven't met Fatim  For two years  Been livin' like I'm single  Evaluatin' all the friendships  Relationship  The reason it's the tenth year  Is 'cause she's a patient chick  And as far as friends are concerned  Many I've had it all  From those who cried for my pain  To those who plotted my fall  I learned to differentiate  Fakes from the great  Mates from the snakes  Apes wanna beef  Hate's all it takes  For me to blow  A diss song for you  Not even worthy  As an album filler  So now it's smiles  And Alhamdulillah  Yeah, love me  Or hate me  This who I am  Look at the past at times  I wish that I was born again  So I can rectify mistakes  And my wrong doings  Attempts on minimizing my sins  Before my story ends  I ain't no Eddie Murphy  Tryin' to sound as a holy man  But if I tried to be a better person  Now I prolly can  (Wait...)  Who am I to advise you  I ain't been the best  Of God's slaves  Just a poet writin'  What my thought says  A little house  A little car  A little sweet girl  Thank you Lord  I'll try to slow it down  On the cheap thrills  This song will prolly stir  A little controversy  At least I ain't be rappin'  Bout the stuff  As tho' I'm born in Jersey  Stage name is Malique  And lost name is Cairel  Mama told me  Stop complaining too much,  So I will...   Chorus  Ult li albi bissaraha (I'm opening up my heart with honesty)  Hayya nab'idil karaha (Let’s avoid the hated and hatred)  Syakkireena a' kulli ni'ma (Let's remain thankful with what we have)  Ba' ideena anil fattana (Let's avoid all lies and sins)   [i]by Too Phat, featuring Yassin[/i]

      [mood: confused] [listening to: berhenti berharap - SO7] [current project: nil]    Aku tak percaya lagi  Dengan apa yang kau beri  Aku terdampar disini  Tersudut menunggu mati   Aku tak percaya lagi  Akan guna matahari  Yang dulu mampu terangi  Sudut gelap hati ini   Aku berhenti berharap  Dan menunggu datang gelap  Sampai nanti suatu saat  Tak ada cinta kudapat   Kenapa ada derita  Bila bahagia tercipta  Kenapa ada sang hitam  Bila putih menyenangkan  ha... ha...   Aku pulang....  Tanpa dendam....  Ku terima... kekalahanku...   Aku pulang...  Tanpa dendam...  Kusalut kan .. kemenanganmu...   Kau ajarkan aku bahagia  Kau ajarkan aku derita  Kau tunjukkan aku bahagia  Kau tunjukkan aku derita  Kau berikan aku bahagia  Kau berikan aku derita..   Aku pulang....  Tanpa dendam....  Ku terima... kekalahanku...   Rebahkan kalbumu  Lepaskan perlahan  Kau akan mengerti  Semua..   Aku berhenti berharap  Dan menunggu datang gelap  Sampai nanti suatu saat  Tak ada cinta kudapat..

        MAKING LOVE OUT OF NOTHING AT ALL (Air Supply)    I know just how to whisper  And I know just how to cry  I know just where I find the answers  And I know just how to lie  I know just how to fake it  And I know just how to scheme  I know just when to face the truth  And then I know just when to dream  And I know just where I touch you  And I know just what to prove  I know when to pull you closer  And I know when to let you loose   And I know the night is fading  And I know the time’s gonna fly  And I’m never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you  But I know I’ve got to give it a try   And I know the roads to riches  And I know the ways to pain  I know all the rules and then I know how to break’em  And then I always know the name of the game   But I don’t know how to leave you  And I’ll never let you fall  And I don’t know how you do it  Making love out of nothing at all   Making love  Out of nothing at all  Making love  Out of nothing at all  Making love  Out of nothing at all  Making love  Out of nothing at all  Making love  Out of nothing at all  Making love  Out of nothing at all   Everytime I see you, well the rays of the sun are all  Streaming through the waves in your hair  And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes  Like a spotlight  The beating of my heart is a drum and it’s lost  And it’s looking for a rhythm like you  You can take the darkness from the deep of the night  And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright  I gotta follow it ‘cause everything I know  Well, it’s nothing ‘till I give it to you   I can make the runner stumble  I can make the final block  And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle  And I can make all the stadiums rock&nbsp;   I can make tonight forever  Or I can make it disappear by the dawn  And I can make you every promise that’s ever been made  And I can make all your demons be gone   But I’m never gonna make it without you  Do you really wanna see me crawl ?  And I’m never gonna make it like you do  Making love out of nothing at all   Making love  Out of nothing at all...

       Siapa Di Hatimu   Terasa bagai ditusuk sembilu bisa  Pedihnya entah bila akan terhenti  Berkasih di rimba asmara berapi  Terbakar hanya ku sendiri  Oh mengapa?...   Kemana hilang janji dan sumpah setia  Kemana tumpah selaut harum kasturi  Apakah mungkin kan terulang kembali  Asyiknya cinta bagai dulu?  Atau serapuhnya mimpi yang pulang pagi?   Semakin ingin aku lupakan  Dan semakin bayang wajahmu kan menjelma  Dimana kah puncanya derita  Ku sendiri tidak pasti, sayang.   Siapa merebut seri cinta  Waktu aku buka jendela  Dikeheningan pagi indah   Siapa sejambak mawar merah  Harum dikamar hatimu  Hingga diriku disingkirkan   Redup senja dikaki malam  Menghilangkan warnai lalang  Dan cinta kini bagaikan berkasihan mimpi      Lagu ciptaan : Wan Zul  Lirik : Siso  Nyanyian: Rahmat
