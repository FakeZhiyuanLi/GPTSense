       urlLink Weblog: 'Allegory' Job 'Favorite Book in the New Testament,' Says Howard Dean - Christianity Today Magazine   A little old, but great none the less.  I came across this today and can't stop laughing.  What a "scream."

      And I'll just go ahead and let everyone know that I'm not crazy about school, I never have been. But strangely enough I'm looking forward to getting into this stuff, and yes the big reason is so that I can get it over with. I'm eager to start on my masters work, although I'm not certain what school I will do it with. I will soon have my BA finished in Theology from  urlLink The Baptist College of Florida . I have quite a bit of Bible and theological training behind me and continue to learn thru my own study. I do not want to get into a program that will take 3 times as long to finish as a masters from a secular school. Just a little rant.

      I went to my first PK in Atlanta this weekend with my father and brother-in-law and and their church  urlLink Emmanuel Baptist  (this church  ROCKS ) . "The Dad" got stuck in Atlanta on business so Daniel and I drove up to meet him and had a great time on the road together. We were quite a team navigating thru downtown Atlanta in a Chevy Surburban, only running one red light. In our defense, the lights are pretty small in that city.  The event was incredible, just as I expected it to be. The worship was wonderful. Imagine hearing 17,000 men sing together to their Lord. The speakers cut to the chase and to my heart. My take-away was I must be a servant to my family, constantly putting my wife and son first and myself below them. The challenge has been made, the plan laid out before me, and there is a lot of hard work to come. But my family will not fail, they are my treasure.   Check out the PK website  urlLink HERE .

      So I've decided to jump into this blog thing, although I'm not 100% why just yet. I have several reasons for trying this out. I want an online presence where people I know and others I meet can get to know more about me and the thoughts I think. I'm also a pretty colorful guy with many interests and this is a good place for people to browse thru my personality.  The title, this is real, is a simple statement about what I'm passionate about. I want to see past the smoke and costumes and gray and straight into what is real. I'm not into fluff, give me function over form. If it isn't sincere, I don't need it. I don't mind traditions but I will not be controlled by them. This passion comes from the fact that I once was into the show, but wasn't too much on the go. God broke me a while back and now that I have let go of myself, he has been molding me into a useful tool.     Anyway, if you're interested, check in on me from time to time to see what I'm thinking about.
