      Lifes not about the job you have, or the amount of education and intelligence you hold in your head. Its much bigger than that and it is so retarded that people put such great emphasize on the importance of getting a career, getting a huge pay check in order to be successful. So what if i think successful is becoming famous, or wearing versaces , or shooting someone you hate in the head. I have my own belifs and u take ures. Im not gonna work that hard so when i have kids they dont have to feel as if they need to live up to my standards. Its retarded as helll

      long time no blog. skool drives me crazy i mean 10 pg long science lab, essay, ss letter, test all in the same day is fuckin retarded.  anyways im sad rite now coz i have nothing to do for halloween. thats stupid coz i always have stuff to do..until now.. this sucks. I hate halloween. Halloween is overrated. and its stupid. think bout it dumbasses dressing up as ugly creatures (as if theyre not already ugly enuf) go from door to door asking for candy. yah like thats not greedy. why dont u take the candy and go feed hungry ethiopian kids huh? yah i used to enjoy halloween but now ive become bitter.. kinda like Stephen. ya bitcharoonie i am. i hate halloween.

      "dont take life so seriously ure never gona get out of it alive" I mean come to think of it..whys skool so important to u ..so u can get a job..or a career..and not end up making coupons for people? is that what life is all about? so we can run round with a certificate and tell everyone that we have a PH.D. in law? Impressive sure..but it sure as hell doesn't impress your heart. As a kid im sure u wanted to be a firefight, a dancer, an actress, a soccer star....whatever our parents arent. I mean come on! u never said u wanted to be an accountant when u were 5 yrs old...why wud u be one when ure 30? thats just wasting ure life away... why do u have to take everythin so seriously anyways? lifes not about this.. its about what we're not.. coz look what we've all become..

      im not sure what a best friend really is. i mean.. i dont think i ever had one. The ones i thought of who were my best friends all walked away and turned their backs...and i dont think they were my friends.. i dont think they ever will be and i dont think they give a shit either.. but i do Friends only happen in story books..the ones u tell ure deepest secrets to, the one u confide in, the one u run to for everythun, the ones with the shoulders to cry on, the one to kick bitches for u, the ones to make u laugh..(by tellin a native joke (see below)), or the ones that tell the truth  no matter how it hurts.. or maybe it only comes once in a while  and i just havent gotten to that point yet.. nah. i dont think they exist... maybe we're all dreaming..we wake up and this is just a bad bad dream...

      Msn is a waste of time. What wud i rather be out doing? Jumpin off a cliff. But oh wait.. in Edmonton there are no cliffs to jump off. How bout Mountains?...nope.. oceans? nope.. which brings me down to one point Edmonton is the worst place to kill ones self. Which also explains why Edmonton has so many natives....its very hard to kill yourself in here

      Im gona be damned bored on halloween for the first time since i was like 5. well first of all everyone has either their own plans or think its halloween is stupid.. well ill have fun bein a loner...AS USUAL. aw well ill just give out candy....drugged candy..that is. heehee  thoughts of the day: everyone has thier own deep dark secrets they they wont and never will tell anyone about. Im sure everyone finds flaws within every human being yet people never seem to find flaws within themselves. you know why? its coz we're stupid stupid people. coz whaever bad happens in the world we lay the blame on someone else. i mean its ALWAYS someone elses fault but never ours huh? indeed we are human on the outside bitches on the inside.

      i think we all die before we get to do everything we want to.. and it really kinda sucks coz no one knows for sure if we're ever gonna get another chance to. A chance to be what we're not, be what we wanna be, and do what we wanna do without the fear of death in the way. We all know that the time draws closer each day but our minds always refuse to think what we don't want to think of. But what happens when it comes faster than our eyes can see..what can we expect? What if we die unsatisfied and have millions of regrets..what ifs what ifs. thats why im gona get high on weed in my death bed.. haha

      To those of you who've changed the way you think, act, look, and feel just to put on a new image for high school are fulla shit. I mean just coz u cover up ure old image of being ureself and what u were doesnt mean its making ure life any better. I mean u may be mr./mizz popular, u may have more "friends" but ure head is fucked in its own way. Whats the point of being what ure not? Yea coz being someone totally new image and leaving ure old friends behind will sure help u. When something ever happens don't come running bak to those who were real run to those who are fake and watch ure self get burned. I mite have changed goin into high skool but i sure as hell hope not coz i dont wanna be a bitch like those who hold fake images. I dont wanna be fake and i dont wanna live under a new image, i dont wanna have plenty of fake friends or live a fake life. So if any of the above apply to u u mite wanna reconsider or dont.. for all i care.. just dont be a bitch towards me

      SO how am i doin rite now? first i have a headache, im dizzy, im barfy, i have a stuffy nose, sore throat, and im hurting. Then I found out that a friend of myne has been sayin bullshit bout me even though they do not go to my fuckin skool and dotn understand anything about me. To make funa my new friends goes beyond the gawddamn line. Theyre just fuckin jealous coz they have no friends themselves. but bullshit bout me and my friends that arent true is just majorly stupid. Lesson: get ure facts straight before u spread shyt bout me. Secondly when you dont know jackshit dont say anything u fucker. They'll just jealous coz they suck @ life and they suck @ everythin else in between and is nothin but a gawddamn spoiled bitch. And another lesson when someone confronts you bout something u did and u go "uh....no.....no..i uh..never did that..." it doesn't help yourself. So when you lie lie properly and shut the fuck up. Anyways, im cold and hungry and extremely tired and fed up with "friends" i never had....so u tell me how im doin rite now

      yah i typed something and forgot to save so now ill have to start again. im that smart huh?  fear keeps us from doing the things we want to and that is pretty sad if you think about it I mean theres prolly so many things that u wanna do in this world and never get the chance to coza fear. No matter what you do or say fear is a shadow behind u. that was a random thot Anyways another random thought. Over the yrs i have learned that people always tell u to think ahead and think of the future. Me on the other hand i think U shud never think of whats ahead in the future. coz i've learned that not everyone gets to live or be in the future and the things u imagine u cud one day do will prolly never happen and then u come crashing down. The future u plan is never the future ure gonna get. So stop wasting ure damn time.

      I think us humans always want want want, its like we're never satisfied with anything no matter what. I mean when someone gets a million dollars they prolly want a million and one. Its that lame but thats how we work.  so what makes us the way we are? Greed i assume.  hmm ..man, we are all such greedy bitches we have a home, money, family, clothes, food.. but i guess that just aint enuf. im a bitch ure a bitch...which brings me bak to what i always say. humans are fucking stupid.

      You know.. i hate girls.. i really do. Cept for the few that are my best friends which is like 4.. i really and extremely hate girls for everything they are and the way they are. Im not making my self an exception im prolly a really big bitch too just like every other chick ive ever met. I mean girls are just so.. frustarating...they hold grudges, they get these moody things, theyre gossipy, arrogant, and thinks as tho the world evolves around popularity looks and clothes.. i mean it may..im not argueing with that.. but girls are just sucky friends. No matter what girls say they think the world evolves around them..so much for self absorbness. And to those chicks who know theyre extremely hot and know they can get any guys they want..fuck u.. those who break others hearts are bitches man i feel sorry for straight men... Whoever is reading this, trust me chicks are lame and annoying. hey guys may be too maybe everyone is but im not a guy so i have nothin to say against that..anywho bottom line is i hate girls..  was this a weird topic? prolly..but im weird so i guess it works out..

      ever have ona those days where everyone seems to piss u off no matter what they do or say? The question should be ever  not  have ona those days coz i have that practically everyday. its just the stupid ass shit people do and say, the arrogance of everyone and the self absorbness. what do they want from me when they tell me shit? sympathy? coz I have none of that to give away. yah i know a "good" friend is suppose to be there for their friends at all times but sometimes when no ones ever there for u..why should u be there for them?

      Falling through time not a soul in sight The ones that stay are the ones that leave Baring the pain just one last night And in the end our hope we’ll cease Roar past the flames and tranquility Drive past the darkness where one shall cry Pathetic heart no pleasing me The angels fall they do not fly You only gave one solemn promise Or so what I thought it was to be Sealed with none other but a kiss But you failed to keep this now I see I may have been blinded by the tears  But feathered touches cleanse me free Others cry but you silently cheer Tender heart but poisoned by touch Beautifully enclosed but wasting away It finally becomes all too much As we break down but drift astray In a distance one’s body numb Drop to their knees holding broken spirits What have you done what have we become? Life taken away by what you commit Is this what I know.. what you call life?

      so now that AFI is over..theres not much to look fwd to anymore..well i mean the same old mornings afternoons nights school days weekends....yay..fun *sarcasm* Ever since high school started its been like that, it has been so damn boring and homework loaded. Im doin good in school 80-90 averages in subjects or so..but why does it matter anymore..i dont give a shyt..why is school such a big issue in ure mind anyways..i mean if u can't live life right, ure not gaining anything from it, its not making u extremely happy, and ure gettin sick of this fawk.. then a 100 average in school isnt gonna do jack shyt

      AFI kicks ass got to see them and it was AMAZING omg i love them and forever will:    God Called In Sick Today   Let's admire the pattern forming.  Murderous filigree. I'm caught in the twisting of the vine.  Go ascend with ivy, climbing. Ignore and leave for me the headstone crumbling behind.  I can't help my laughter as she cries. My soul brings tears to angelic eyes. Let's amend the classic story, close it so beautifully, I'll let animosity unwind. Steal away the darkened pages, hidden so shamefully. I'll still feel the violence of the lines.  I can't stand my laughter as they cry. My soul brings tears to angelic eyes. And miles away my mother cries. Omnipotence, nurturing malevolence

U think u know but u have no idea . Those that say they know everythung bout me and they know alot bout me and that i tell them everything is lying... thats just a load of  bullshit. coz u dont, u dont know jack shit.

People who get anythun and anyone they want learn to appreciate less and even less after that till it comes to the point where nothing is significant to them. ones that fuck em all and leave em all become skanks, ones that dont appreciate money become poor, ones that dotn understand the importance of everything around them become stupid, and those that are stupid become hated, and hated ones become assholes and everyone knows that assholes get their asses kicked... but i dont feel pity for them.  Some ppl deserve their asses kicked good.. while i watch with my eyes and feel no pity. nothing.

      Why can't people distinguish the difference between funny and not funny. THere are times when jokes are funny but when u take it way too fucking far its just pathetic. I mean its like LET IT GO ALREADY! It made me laugh once...or twice or maybe even 3 times..but after that..it gets OLD and u can LEAVE IT BEHIND... ARGH i hate it when ppl take jokes too far then it just becomes ruined.. like this chick i know..her and her sex jokes..k it was funny for liek what? the first 5 seconds..and she still goes on and on about them. I MEAN SHUT UP GET OVER IT! I MEAN EVERYONE IN THE GAWDDAMN UNIVERSE KNOWS THAT SHES NOT ABOUT TO HAVE SEX ANYTIME SOON...LOOK @ HER FUCKING FACE.. .I MEAN ID RATHER FUCK A DOG!!

      There is only 1 type of people i hate and that is selfcentered, arrogant, cocky bastards. Although it is only 1 category many many bastards in this world fit under it.  I esp. hate this one kid who thinks he all great when in reality he has absolutely no friends, and he is nothing botu a cocky fuck face. He says that IM a loser, and that IM immature, that IM stupid, that I cant do anything rite, and that IM fucked up.. (well i prolly am all those things) But I have one question for that cocksucker. If U hate me sooo fucking much, why do u still talk to me? GET THE PICTURE, EAT A DICK, AND PLEASE FOR THE SAKE OF ALL OF US, HOP OFF THE NEXT FUCKING CLIFF.

      Never get ure hopes up too high for evntually ull come crashing down. THat is the truest thign i have ever heard. It is so fucking true. No matter how much we tell our selves this it happens over and over again all too often. Situations trick our minds into thinking that we are suceeding..when we are only failing.

      "u'll never know if u don't try....then again somethings are better off not knowing"  Its true and forever will it be. Think it through. You always wonder what would have happened if u did this and if u did that ..then once u do it.. u wish u never knew.  Sometimes the eldest are not the wisest theyre the bravest. THe more you live in this world and the more you see and realize, the more ignorant you'll become. You'll be exposed to humans and since humans are nothing but ignorant beings it'll cause you to be stupid as well. As i always say humans are fucked. However those that are older than you are the bravest for they have faced each of lifes challenges. And you knwo what...thats the hardest thing to do in this world. There is always a point in your life where u wish for all to stop and you just wish you cud disappear or die. If you live it to the end ..you have my complete and fullest respect ..coz its pretty fuckin hard.

      Completely random thoughts:   there comes down to a poitn where enough is enough. U can complain all u want but nothing is ever going to change. but hey that doesnt stop me from complaining.  We all know the truth in our hearts but we're always afraid to look into it. Sometimes we get so caught up within ourselves that we forget the others around us. Then again..theyre not  that  important to begin with. haha.    I hate guys who think they can get any chick they want and think theyre so hot when theyre fucking not. I just wanna smash them in the fuckin face and make them even more uglier than they were to begin with. I hate cockiness and arrogant dickfaces and i wish for them to just go away.   Also i hate ppl who talk to me like im a retard especially when im trynna be nice by makin actual conversation when its awkward silences. The little things tend to piss me off than the big things coz its just the small things that happen over and over again if u know what i mean. the big things happen ones in a while. the worthless little thigns happen every hr. im not a retard pissface so u can stop it with the act. put it down coz the only retard i see here is u.

      so we go to school each day, go to classes, eat lunch, go back to classes, go home, do homework. Why? Why do we chain outselves to something that we dont even want to do? Why do we even give a shit? The people that lived years before us lecture us saying that "we should be happy we even get to go to school." Um.. no .. i dont understand what they mean by it. hell id rather work on a farm milking cows and be a hick than go to school.

      isnt it possibly for someone half the age of an elderly be able to have lived more years in this world than the elder ever has. For example cud a 15 yr old have lived longer than a 60 yr old? it's probably possible because soem ppl in this world has gone through more than anyone ever has that they appear to have seen more in the world than 100 years could make others see.   anyways.. u can complain as much as u want bout the life u have and about things not goin ure way like i do but in the end if u really sit and disect everything thats goin on in ure life the truth is.. u cant do jack shit about any of it. live the life u have the best u can and in the end thats all that matters. I mean all of us anyone whose reading this rite now has prolly gone through shit enough shit alot of shit so much shit that its impossible to not gain anything out of it.

      whats wrong with being a loner... i mean everyone is each to their own, meaning we're all loners @ heart. Just coz some ppl dont hang out in big groups and appears to enjoy being by themselves doesnt make them a total loser. I mean we all have our own world, we all care about ourselves the most, we have our own secrets no one knows, and we tell ourselve things. We just stand in popular big clicks to put on an image to others when deep down .. ure a loner and u have no friends. But thing is.. what IS wrong with beign a loner besides the images of lookin cool? .... not that IM a loner....

Do u ever wonder what everyone is gonna be like 30 years from now? well i do and i dont. coz thinking ahead of time is really pretty pathetic. coz u dont know whether ure gonna be alive 30 years from now..hell u dont know if ure gonna be living the next day. and once u dont acheive ure dreams it brings u down ..so live life as it comes live each day as it flies.

      would u rather be told a sweet sugar coated lie, or would u rather here the bitter harsh truth?  The thing is many of us are too fake. We tell our people that theyre smart when u know they are indeed stupid, you tell them theyre hot when they are indeed not, you tell them they can get any guy they want when you know that they indeed cannot. you tell people lies to make them feel better bout themselves but ever though of the fact that lies hurt more than the truth? I mean if they already know an answer to the question and u tell them the opposite of what is true , it doesnt help to hear it. it only makes u feel more shitty at times. If theyre dumb say so, if theyre ugly say so, if they cant get any guy say so, or dont say anything at all. sweet sweet lies, bitter bitter truth.. .u pick   i write so much bullshit on here.. and im a total hypocrite.. u shud hate me..

      the older we get the more expensive we get...  Coz when we were yougn we really didnt care bout images, we didnt have to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars buying clothes that are in fashion, we cudnt drive so we didnt think bout wanting cars, we didnt care bout having out own tv or own computer..coz when we were little all we wanted was candy and itd make our day. That i tell u, is what makes us different rite now from when we were kids way back when. I mean guys had cooties how much easier did that make it? ALOT.   Stupid people are the ones that fuck up their own lives and the ones thats appear to get the good out of this world when in reality theyre receiving none. why? its coz theyre too stupid to realize others around them, theyre too stupid to care, theyre to stupid to think of anythun else but them selves. and once they get burned in this world, they cant blame it on others because they know very well the reason they got burnt is coza themselves and their stupid actions. And u know what? stupid people damn well deserve to get their lives fucked..but then again all of us humans are stupid stupid creatures

      You think i bitch bout nothing, complain about anything when i shudnt. and u know what? ure prolly damn well rite. but since ive realized its my life and i can do whatever i want with it i choose to bitch, thank you very much. For years ive never said a peep about shit that happens, ive never spazzed @ anyone and now..well its come down to the point where I've met reality so therefore u get these blogs of bitterness.   People dont respect each other enough no matter how much you respect them personaly in the end it doesnt matter. Coz ure only one single person in their world only one person that means nothing what so ever. Stop trickin your self thinking u deserve attention. because I know im not gonna be as important in someones life as i am important in myne. lifes like that

      Sometimes u have a craving for somethung but then when u think more about it u realize u dont know what u want anymore. and even if u have everythun in ure life it always feels as if something is missing but then again u cant put ure finger on what it is. and its nto bout the material things its something more yet u just dont know what it is. I guess we're all empty souls in side because of our greed we always want more and more and even once we accomplish our goal its never enough for us. we strive for what we cant get. Always.   I think im beginning to realize what real friends are, and im beginning to see maybe way back when i really had no idea what a friend was, i just assumed i had them when mayeb i really never did. lifes like that

      God Called In Sick Today- AFI download it  Wudnt it be fun to be famous. I always thot it wud be fun even tho other ppl wud convince me of otherwise. I dont know maybe eventually ull get sick of ure life being famous but i think eventually everyone gets sick of something. But when ure famous u getta be all u wanna be. I think itd be fun to see ure self everywhere, in books magazines, tv, movies, and then ppl recognize u and ask for ure autograph and then u feel special coz ure well known. Oh did i tell u that famous people get moola? yes lot of it too. I mean if u go to one magazine interview they give u a box of juicy coutures, food, lifetime supply of make up and everythun u want. Its amazing to be famous. Ure just jealous!

      so its almost a brand new year.  this yr was awesome @ times and completely fucked at other times. There was so much that happened but our minds can only remember just a tiny portion of it. Each day depended upon what we made of it and what we did to make it good or bad. not others. we chose our paths daily, monthy and yearly. Its hard to say if this yr was good or bad because it was definitly a mixture between the both. If i said that this yr was the best i wud definitly be lying and if i said it wasnt it wudnt be true either. coz in a way it WAS the best and then again it wasnt. This yr turned us from good times in jr. high to the fucked up high school time..so far. We told our friends that we wud keep in touch talk daily and always remember the good times. But those were lies i found. my friends and i do NOT talk daily, and ive lost touch with so many of them but i still do remember the good times.  i just wish we could go back to them. I realized no matter how much i thot jr. high sucked.. in reality i think i actually enjoyed it. I can only wish it will be the same for high school. The good and the bad ranges from friends, to family, to death and reality. Jr. high came and flew by and we got hit with high school. and its definitly not the way i imagined high school to be like. i wish to turn back time. Setting aside school i had the most amazing times with my friends that i wont forget..from paris to simply lunch hrs to class times to inside jokes it always stands out. fucked up summer i had though. but we move on we learn and we seek new challenges. Overall id have to say that this year was amazing. and i can only simply describe it as: Life is Good.

      u know what bothers me... those lil miss perfect families seen on television. well my family is great but we're no picture perfect family. i guess im just jealous of those oncs seen on tv... its kinda hard to believe any family can be liek that..those ones that never get into an arguement, those kids that can get anythign they want, those families that always seen to be home and never at work yet they seem to have a rich ass house as well as rich clothes, and their house is ALWAYS neat and tidy, also, if the family isnt snuggled up together watchign a family movies they are probabaly in the kitchen bakign cookies together. unbelievable. but it happens.

      I am so simplistic. I am the least complicated person ull ever know. and it takes so little to satisfy me but many people dont take the time to do the little things that mean alot, thats why im never satisfied with anything. If u just took the time to see, ull realize how simple i am. If someone proposed to me with a $2 ring instead if a real diamond ring. if soemone gave me any pink flower picked outta the school yard instead of a rose. if someone gave me lollipops instead of expensive chocolates, if someone sang me a song instead of got me the cd i wanted, if soemone wrote a book for me instead of buy a book, if someone was just a real friend but didnt get me anything materialistic... id be more than satisfied.

      I dont know what it takes to satisfy me. notice how im always bitching bout somethign i hate but im never blogging bout something i love? what IS it i love.. i dont think ive found that out yet maybe someday i will   I HATE it when people invite themselves in. I hate it when ppl obviously know ure in a damn conversation but chose to join in and just HAVE to be a part of everything even tho they know well that they are not liked. I hate people who think EVERYONE likes them when in reality EVERYONE HATES THEM. I want to smash them in the fuckign face. ITS NOT LIKE ITS MY FAULT URE A LONER AND I WANT IT TO STAY THAT WAY. Also when i tell u to "fuck off" PLEASE fuck off.  anyways thank u have a nice day please turn left and jump off the next cliff.

      Today was a very boring, repetitive, shitty day.. kinda like every other day. anyways ever get the feelign where ure just drifitng through the day absentmindedly liek ure just walking through a dream?  Its so weird and it seems like ure wasting your days away. I've always told my self that id make the best of each and everyday and live it to the fullest but after awhile i guess i kinda gave up on that so here I am wasting life away. its sad.   Anyways some people that piss me off arent the ones i have anythign against, arent they ones that are annoying or cocky or arrogant nor the ones i hate and want to die... theyre the ones im jealous of.   Ppl may say im fine the way i am btu they never act like i am. I mean if i was so "perfect" the way i am you wud actually give a fuck bout me and not dedicate your attention to someone whose obviously way better than i am and you realize it. You can tell me so much but i know theyre only words. words that dont mean a thing which is why i rarely believe what anyone says. If you spoke the truth I wudn't be here sulkign bout it wud i now. yah thats right. You tell me im perfect but u dont act liek i do, you act like every other person is but me.

      My english essay topic:   Why I Hate Girls   (read this is you want but its quite lengthy.. )        Although I have nothing against these girls in this class, I do have many reasons to hate the typical squealy girl that you all know too well.  You are probably all wondering why I chose to do a topic on “why I hate girls” even though I am a girl myself. Well as I go further into my presentation you will come to understand why, and you may change your own point of view as well.        In the past, I have had my share of friends and enemies many off which were girls. After so many years I have finally come down to one point...I really dislike them. Of those who I befriended, I only have about four friends who are girls and for the rest have disappeared simply or became my enemy all of which were because of very stupid reasons. When I speak about girls, I do not make myself an exception, I only speak for every typical girl out there. First of all, if you’ve ever sat down and had a decent conversation with a girl, you will notice that everything that comes out of her mouth is gossip, nothing but.  I guess gossips are fun for a little bit when you join a group of girls and laugh along making mean and nasty comments until you realize that you are the star of the rumor, you are the one they’re talk about, the one they bring down and the one that has just been stabbed in the back. If that has ever happened to you before you have all of my respect. Also, it is almost guaranteed that any rumor that has been spread around the school about you or anyone else, was started by a girl.        Have you ever shown a girl a picture of your puppy only to find yourself plugging your poor ears trying to drown out the bloodcurdling shriek coming out of her mouth? Tip: never show a girl something cute if you want to spare your ears. Well.. becoming deaf could be good and bad.. it goes both ways. I mean, you would lose your hearing but at least your days of listening to a girl talk is over. If you see a bug on the street prepare to plug your ears, but if you kill it for her.. umm ..plug your ears once again. That’s right no matter what you do you are never going to satisfy a girl. After all, she IS a princess or that’s what she thinks.       If you have ever insulted a girl you will never hear the end of it, not after many many years, she will forever hold a grudge on you even if you apologize a billion times, and shower her with gifts she’ll always bring up that time you might have accidentally called her fat. That’s just how a girl is, even after many years I don’t know what it takes for her to forgive and forget and finally move on. I guess with a girl she will only ever give you one chance but for her you are suppose to give her many chances or she’ll cry till you give in. Don’t tell me you have never given in to a crying, sobbing female. Yah that’s right. Never piss a girl off, you will never hear the end it. However, if you chose to give her a compliment..  you might want to be careful with that as well. If you call a girl pretty, they sometimes run to their friends and tell them that you have a crush on her and eventually you are going to get called a stalker. Be careful! You’ve heard the line a way to a girls heart is to make her laugh. Because some girls cannot take a joke, you might want to be cautious while doing so. This leads us back to the fact that girls will hold grudges on you even though you were only joking and explained that many time to her, she is too ignorant to realize that since she thinks the world evolve around her and only her.       Some people say girls make great friends, I on the other hand have concluded that girls are great backstabbers. One minute they’re your friend, the next they will be talking about you behind your back or ditching you for the popular girls leaving you all by your lonesome wondering why. I’ve had my experience of backstabbers and it is not pretty. They tell you lies, and they tell you things you want to hear when really they mean the total opposite. If you ever tell a girl a secret, prepare for everybody to know about it the next day. If you ever come to her feeling down, hoping she’ll give you some good advice you might want to reconsider. She’ll either be too busy spending 5 hours on her hair just to go out and walk her dog, or she’ll be too busy dressing up her Barbie doll to really even care what you have to say. Somehow though, you’re suppose to care for her when she comes to you with a problem... shows how great a friend girls are huh?            Last few tips from you to me: Never take a girl shopping. You will have to wait for her to try on 50 different articles of clothing but only to find her buying nothing in the end. Never tell a girl to open a pop can for you.. she might break a nail and once she does you’re done for.           So if your reputation is ruined by rumors, you became deaf, or backstabbed by a girl don’t tell me I didn’t warn you. If we were to wipe out all the squeal, annoying, gossipy, grudge holding, backstabbing females in the world... there’d be no girls left.

      As years go by I race the clock with you But if you died right now You know that I'd die to I'd die too  You remind me of the times When I knew who I was (I was) But still the second hand will catch us Like it always does  We'll make the same mistakes  I’ll take the fall for you I hope you need this now  Cause I know I still do  Until the day I die (Until the day I die) I'll spill my heart for you, for you Until the day I die (Until the day I die) I'll spill my heart for you  Should I bite my tongue? Until blood soaks my shirt We'll never fall apart Tell me why this hurts so much My hands are at your throat And I think I hate you But still we'll say, "remember when" Just like we always do  My hands are at your throat And I think I hate you We made the same mistakes Mistakes like friends do  My hands are at your throat And I think I hate you We made the same mistakes

      sometimes we complain bout how much our lives suck but in reality we never took the time to see how much worst it cud be. I mean lifes like that , Could be better, Could be worst but for the majority it cud be definitly much worst than much better. anyways in comparison to other peoples problems in the world our complaints are almost nothing.  i dont understand the ignorance of us human beings.. i guess thats just the way we were made  Anywho, u know how celebrities who are so rich fling money around and buy anythin and everythin they want. unlimited amounts of clothes, 50 cars, a hugemungous house, and all the useless gadgets? u know how that pisses u off alot and u say 'gee what a spoiled asshole' but when u think bout it.. if U had that kinda money ud do the same. i bet ure ass u wudnt give away ure money to charaty.. THATS RITE i know u u and ure greedy ass just like me!

      i always wanted to be one of those people who say they dont give a shit and they really mean it. As for me, i say it but i sure as hell dont mean a word of it. When you dont give a shit bout anything u hurt less, ure happier, and ure free. As for the rest of us jackasses who care way too much about everyone and everything i guess thats just the way its gonna be no matter how much we hate it. Yah it kinda sucks. I wish i didnt have the gene that made me care..but apparently i do

        Your conscience breaks you down on the ground Waiting in the silence not a sound  Once it opens you’re out that door Do realize those hearts that you’ve tore Running away keep running from all of us May tomorrow bring you not more but even less If you ever fall, leave your life and flee The last thing you’ll get is sympathy from me  Taking greyhound buses down the suburban end of town Staring into space just walking around What’s the point of leaving your shack When eventually you’re coming back? Few days pass without you, then a little less than a year Vaguely I remember your face, still wondering why you are not here Say you can’t be here anymore Drugged you’re lying here on the floor Unmoving but I know you’re alive Forever I know that you will thrive Then I realize your body is cold Did the real story completely unfold? Thought you didn’t have the strength to do the deed When it finally came around I’m now watching you bleed

      Jealousy is not good but i guess everyone gets it once in awhile. Sometimes the least expected people are probably the ones being jealous about the least expected things. Funny how it works. Envious of others all the time. No matter what you say i guess theres always a twinge of jealousy in me.. unless u talk about me.. good things that is. Im finding myself to be more and more self centered by the minute.. i sure hope u dont notice.. and if u do i mite just have to shoot you.

      maybe i need more positive blogs.. ok here goes. i hope ure reading this.. (that was directed to someone)  never do somethun that u know u shudnt be doing, if ure going through shit there is ALWAYS someone thats going through more shit than you.. if ure thinking of doing somethun bad think of the consequences.. "permanent solutions for temporary problems" does not solve anything..and it never will. why are u bringing ureself down into ure own shit hole when eventually ull have to come back up for air.. why are u taking ureself down to hell and why are u leaving ure life behind. u cant do that u just cant leave behind somethung and hope to start soemthin fresh. u gotta finish the shity life u have now. dont leave us behind and dont leave the friends that care. because truely even when assholes are being asses to u u still have those who truely do care. dont run away and dont leave. i dont care if ure a shithead, i dont care if uve exposed me to shit, i dont care if ure fugly, i dont care if u suck @ life, i really dont care just dont leave.  that i care.

      exams are done thank gawd. i am havign a blast rite now.. by myself but whatever!  'Donald Duck never wears shorts, but when he comes out of the shower he has a towel on. whats that all about?' -Chandler (Friends)  -----just thot that was a clever remark.   normally i cudnt care less but just feeling slightly lonely at the moment. not that im complaining or anything. just dont get the luck regular people get alrite.. i mean regular hot people but hey what can ya say. u get what ur born with and u stick with what ur born with. unless ur rich and are able to get plastic surgery.. lucky bastards....  Never give mixed signals i cant take em i just get mroe and more confused.. well give em if u want me to come crashing down... the perfect formula. always. sometimes u just cant control anything u feel. even tho u know its not right and in the end ur just gonna get hurt. but ur mind doesnt realize that.. i mean if we were all able to not feel wud there be sadness in the world? i think not. so id say when things dont work out, when things are bringing u down, coming close to tears, when things get fucked up just coza ur uncontrollable damn feelings.. then its time to move on. yup.. looks like its just me tonight again.. i need a guy nudey pen..

      i think i love u.. alot and the words u say to me, mean more to me than anything else.. yet with you comes flaws, sometimes so big that no matter how hard i try to force myself to.. i cant look past them. Makes me almost want to hate you..tho i know it wudn't be reasonable... because you havent done anything to me right? cept say those words.. that mean so much it makes me want to cry and makes me want to cry harder if i shall ever find those words to fail me.. to have truly finally realize that the little blackness of doubts inside me was true all along.. words are nothing but lies.

      today was such a strange day. it was good wasnt bad it was absolutely nothing. pretty much a waste of time if u ask me. sometimes i dont understand people. they show such mixed emotions.. do they like me do they not, do they mean all the words they say to me, are they really my good friends.. no matter what ill always have doubts. im always insecure about everything and no matter what i say or try to believe in, it sticks there. so please dont ever get mad @ me when i have doubts in you.. its just the way i am. its not as if uve done anything wrong.. its just the fact that i do everything wrong.

      Wishing for those screams to be louder So that it could drown out your words My heart is crushed up to chalked powder Caged in ones misery suffering birds.  Drowning out your thoughts I hear But it is too late I’ve heard them all The sound has come and disappeared But rings through tears are these silent calls. Hating all those that thrive in this place How they survive as I fail miserably.  Secretly we’re all a creations of disgrace Your arrogance does not impress me Touches of your fingers upon my skin Only spell hatred as I’m tranquilized Numb with fear smiles wearing thin Close to death I realize Last touch of your pen last stroke of ink Final inch of paper for you to write This nightmare left for us to think.  What is left for me tonight?

      dont u get this uneasy feeling when u know u shud be studyign yet u dont want to so u decide not to but it only makes it feel even more uneasy? no? o well.   im an idiot. i learn to never question anything. dont have doubts. just embrace what u have and let life move on. dont ever feel uneasy about it. dont ever feel unsure. it may trick u in the future. it may come around to backstab u. but if its making u happy now. so be it. dont let it go. who cares about consequences. who cares what will happen the yr after or the day after. this is now. this is it. who knows what will happen to u the next day.

      its not like its a bad thing ritie.. that sometimes we have to take a moment to hate. to hate every gawddamn thing out there. anything created. anything that lives. and wanting to kill something someone just to see them hurt. just to make them feel how u feel. so they'll see that this life is not damn fairytale. that u can never kill the enemy and live happily ever after. that there are no friends for life. ure not a damn princess and money doesnt come frlom the sky. there are peopel that hurt u. people that kill people who are just fucking assholes. altho u think pretends are just for kids.. its not.. everyone is a gawddamn fake. distinguish them so you dont get hurt. u know.. if u find somethign worth urself.. take it embrace it dont let it go and dont question it. savor it.. its urs. maybe not forever...  dont be a sorry person.. life is too short to be sorry.

      today i had a shitty/moody day.. im just gona blog all my feelings out on here. u can read it if u want and if it gets boring u can leave and i wudnt give a fcuk.   gawd i am soo fucking glad to be home because i dont think i cud have taken anymore of school. it wasnt as if i was having a completely horrible day where everything was going wrong.. not one bit. it was those kinda days where everything and i mean EVERYTHING pissed me off one way or another. no matter what u said what u did i wud go off spazzing and bitching like a muthafukin tard. i hate showing my feelings to others because i know how much i hate it when others do it. but hey what can i say?  i AM a fucking hypocrite. Usually i give the appearence of everythign is fine and ok and that im extremely happy.. but today.. well i just didnt have the energy to hide it. So therefore people came up to me askign what the hell was wrong.. and well stupid as it may sound.. i have no clue. i dont know what was so bad about my day i dont know why im so fucking mad i dont know much at all. all i kno is i feel like complete SHIT.   It was those days where i drifted from class to class totally absentminded.. i had no fuckign clue what was going on, what those teachers taught me, what homework or tests i have, who i talked to, what i said, what i did. it was liek walking through a dream.. i bad dream.. a nightmare.. it was insane. i just wasted 7 hrs of my life.. and i cant go back and change it all. Even walking down the fuckign hallway pissed me off when lil kids (well they were prolyl all older than me but whatever) were standing in the way of me. I wanted to smash them in the face tell them to fuck off and jump off that cliff. that beautiful fuckin cliff.    I hate hate hate it when people come to me complaining about absolutely NOTHING. and that is EXACTLY what im doing right now. I find myself so damn annoying.. i find it so fucking easy to hate me altho no one has ever told me so. U know.. u cud just come up to me and tell me that u hate me and i really cudnt care less. its better than faking that u like me. I really would rather know.. i bet if all my "friends" read this.. the very next day theyd come up and tell me so.. and then ill realize i AM really gawddamn hated. Seriously.. dont complain about nothing..its not worth it and it pisses others off. but its nto as if im complaining to anyone in particular.. im just bloggin it out. so let me be. u dont like it? go to russia. go to china. go to hell for al i care. but seriously i may appear to be sad and pissed but dont bother with me.. dont talk to me about it. dont try to be a friend towards me because.. i am not gona take out my feelings on u alrite? and i am not gona tell u anything coz i know how much i hate it when peopel complain to me.. fuck u complainers fuck u.   What is wrong with u. that is the question i get asked when i did absolutely nothing. am i an exception amongst anything. am i not allowed to be sad or mad but only happy 24/7   i just told this guy he makes me feel like shit. but i dotn care coz he made me cry.   fuck this im out.

      the things that go on in my mind is completely and utterly crazy. i have no clue what love is. and frankly i really cudnt care less. if im hopeless then imi hopeless and theres nothin worth doing. Im not gona change my self to be like all u pissheads out there. im not gona do anything. im just gona sit here and wait.. and let time consume me. i am sooo moody but confused @ the moment. just let me be.  Derrick just said i need to take ESL.. if u read my blogs or the way i talk on msn. i think he is quite right. ESL isnt for losers ya know.. its for those pissheads that cant speak english yet insists on living in a country where they speak it! COME ON! GO BACK TO CHINA!   I cudnt care less about love but i cudnt care more at the same time..                       mental institute here i come..

      u knwo what? i think im perfectly fine being alone. i dont consider it lonliness. Im content with being it and i dont complain anymore.  watchin all these chicks fuss over guys and how they arent with anyone shows how dependant they are on others.. and u know .. in the real world u cant be that dependant on others. its u against the world. and i feel fine.

      we talked about so much in english and it really made me think. Its bout life and how life is just a candle and it just lasts as long as a candle and can easily end. how we are just actors on the stage that play a part but after the show is done no one knows who u are no one remembers u, it was just like.. a trend. a short trend that one follows but eventually ditches. and after generations.. you become nothingness because no one on earth remembers you. maybe they'll only know ure name but they'll never know you. or.. sometimes ure name disappears along with ure death. I always hear you say: "next yr ill do this.. blahblah" well u knwo what? what if next yr doesnt come? and the year after won't either? what then. all i know is this very second im alive.. what happens next.. im clueless

      "If I Am" by NINE DAYS   So your standing on a ledge,  It looks like you might fall.  So far down,  Or maybe you were thinking about jumping.  Now you could have it all,  If you learned a little patience!  For though I cannot fly,  I'm not content to crawl!...  So give me a little credit,  Have in me a little faith!  I want to be with you forever,  If tommorow's not too late!...  But it's always too late when you've got nothing  So you say!...  But you should never let the sun set on tommorow,  Before the sun rises today...  IF I AM Another waste of everything you dreamed of,  I will let you down...  IF I AM  Only here to watch as you suffer,  I will let you down...

      Did you watch the words that bled down from my frozen lips? I held your hand so tight afraid that I might lose my grip The sweat that trickled down my wrists was empty filled with fear Cried so many times that night I think that I’ve run out of tears I don’t think I’ve ever met anybody that was quite like you You embraced my heart to touch don’t know how you do the things you do You listened as I told you how my life is dark and cold You took a brush and painted the dark with vivid colors bright and bold You magically turned my world around the other way Took my breath and all the thoughts I was about to say You gave the wings back to the butterfly so that it could go on home As I watch him fly I finally knew that I was not alone You gave me a rose so delicate, I touched the thorns and then I bled Taught me how to look pass these thorns to find the beauty of it instead When the stars fell from the sky you caught it and put it back in place The star once trembling began to gleam with radiance and grace  Told me that tonight is the night to embrace and that time is not too late Then I understood how to learn to  love instead of learn to hate For the first time in awhile I smiled and found it not that hard Despite the ugly past I hold I see pass the brutal scars Who are you where you came from it doesn’t matter anymore I learned to see and feel like I never did before Maybe you’re a vision, an angel sent down from up above Don’t leave me here don’t let me go for I need you to love

      im confused and do not know which way im heading. Picture this: its like there is two seperate paths..one thats bright, sunny, and happy. and the other is dark, gloomy and sad. Which one wud u pick? obviously the bright side huh? but with me.. no matter which path i pick i always end up on the wrong side. Im a much bigger talker than i am doer. i say so much but i can never pull it off. its all talk all for show its not me at all. when will we ever come down to a point where we actually are what we wanna be. we're actually satisfied with everything in our life and have absolutely nothing to complain about. when we will all be happy? answer: never

      dreaming takes too much effort, hoping just breaks you down, craving just makes you want more, believing weakens your mind, so just live life absentmindedly and you're on your way to the good times.

      i think i want more than i can get. and i ask for too much. Sometimes you cant control things because you just have to let it happen. Mayeb we are all more selfish than we know, and maybe we're all in greed. but everything is fucking falling apart. but im not going to beat myself up over it. its not my fucking fault, i always stay in place i never step down from people and friends because the last person i really give a shit about in this lifetime is myself. so if you ever think im at fault, im the one in greed, im the sucky friend, im the one that doesnt give a shit about you.. rethink that. dont put any blame on me because im perfect. im marvellous. im everythign u dont have.... that was my cockiness of the day. take it or leave it sweetheart

      The thing we want will never be the things we have everything is unattainable in this gawddamn world Promises are lies peopel are fake, believing and hoping just leaves u stranded and locked up in a cage you will struggle to free from. Friends will never be friends, everything is built upon lies and more lies. its the harsh reality of this world. Just when you think magybe this time just this time you can hope to hold on to what you have.. you eventually lose everything and you are back where you started from. the only thing that mattered, the only thing that kept you grounded, the only thign you ever believed in, the only thing you had..is gone.. what do i have have left for me? "something beautiful is dead"    'Cause You Wanted More More Than I could Give More than I could handle In a life that I can't live You wanted more More than I could bear More than I could offer For a love that isn't there  -TONIC

This is now and sometimes you just gotta face reality in the eye. I have. now its your turn. you are no friend to me.. all those words you ever said all those things you ever claimed .. were lies. you made promises you cudnt keep. and even tho i havent listened to any of those promsies anyone has made in the past for a long time ill admit that a part of me believed the promises you made. And once again the doubts release itself and i am back to where i started at. I believed the promises you cudnt keep.

Today was a much better day because stupid people stopped pissing me off yah so life is going good again 2morow is the last day of school for the week thank gawd.. so yah im out.. c u on the next shitty day.

      today was like shit i am just glad to be home. I can't take much more of school, i already overly spazzed and now everyone probably thinks im a crazy retard. but thats ok coz i never gave much of a fuck about what people though of me.. so why should i now? thats right. i am so uncaring its not even funny.. if you piss me off ur gonna get hell. You know what the problem is? When anything pisses me off i dont want to talk about it, i don't want to do anything, i dont want to analyze it, i dont want to fix it, it just want to crawl into bed and let my problems unfold it self. Why can't people just make me laugh or give a hug instead of talk. Coz the last thing i want to do is talk. hell the last thing i want to do is THINK about the shithole we all live in. I used to do such a good job at hiding my anger but ive ran out of energy to do so. so i let everything show through only to find that pissing me off even more. When you're on a high, when you think life is good.. funny how it can turn it right back the other way. Keep on taking that path you know you shouldn't take.   Do you know how much stupid ditzes piss me off.. i wud like to stick my foot up their ass. Get a fucking life..its nto funny. your stupidity annoys me.

      we are all so shallow at heart, its just a matter of what our standards are.. but we all want something that we can never get. You know that feelign of sucess that you hold when you think you have finally acheive something u were never meant to achieve..  only to  realize later on that it was a load of bullshit and everything uve done in the past was only a path of lies? You obtain glory, pride and hope.. yet you always have that sense of doubt, that hint of fear of failure which eventually finally releases itself unblinding you and open you up to the reality.. You thot you were finally going somewhere with life.. but you were only walking in place.

      The words you whispered meant the world to me. Your promises were the only thing I need, Took those words and poisoned another ear Thought the secrets were only meant for me to hear But I’m degraded, I’m a disgrace I can’t please you, can’t be erased.  Took awhile for me to realize Words are nothing but lies.  Fake deception meant for your mind Complete illusion meant to blind. Drank your blood wishing to become closer to you Choked down that crimson but further apart we grew.  Yet my hands are tightly grasping to your wilted flowers Insanity beginning to devour My eyes searches for your presence to appear Finding nothing but a blur of tears  Lips reach out longing for your touch Am I begging pleading for too much? I only want what you promised me  But your black black heart cannot be free.  My happiness was based upon lies and more lies Those words I trusted were merely a disguise    Did you believe all those words that bled from my lips?  Toxic lies that might have slipped The words that I poisoned in your ear  They swim, they drown, they disappear How long must it take you to realize? My words were nothing but lies.

"That's when I knew, That I could never have you,   I knew that before you did,   Still I'm the one who's stupid,   And there's this burning, Like there's always been,   I've never been so alone, And I've never been so alive.

Arent you ever scared that your life may get worst with time.. and eventually turn into some kind of living hell..  Arent you ever scared that your life will be the life your parents live rite now.. Aren't you ever afraid of life ?   F.E.A.R. ... everytime we hear the word fear we get scared and we despise it because ive always said that fear is the one and only thing that holds us back from everything we do. Without it alot more would be suceeded.. But aren't alot of us afriad to die, afriad to kill.. if you think about it Fear keeps us going.. it keeps us lving and without it.. this world wud be a different place.. and we wud already be in hell.

      some peopel need to learn how to stop craving sympathy and get up off their ass and make something out of themselves and their problems instead of bitch at me about them. its not that i dont care ... oh what the hell... i DONT care about ur problems sometimes.. when ur less than a friend to me.. sympathy my ass. If ur just gona btich and do nothin about ur problems then i cudnt give a shit about u.. get over it. (to my FRIENDS who bitch about their problems go ahead!.. but to regular ppl that wudnt give a shit bout me if i died.. fuck off)   Ive always wanted to be ona those peopel who is nice to everyone and never bitches about anythin is perky 24/7 the ones to make anyone laugh, the one that everyoen goes to for help, the one whose known to be ona the nicest ppl in school.. yah that was prolly my goal @ one point.. and i sure failed good.

      i dont crave sympathy nor wish for u to ask what my problem is.. i dont need a friend to talk to, nor someone who will give advice, i dont need anything from anyone and if u think i bitch and complain alot about nothing..well then u are absolutely correct. its nto as if i btich to anyone in particular im just blogging it out. im not a total loser, i dont have a fucked up family, im not in poverty, im not hungry, im not sad, im not sick, i dont have backstabbing friends,n  i dont have a broken heart,.. so ur thinking gawddamn what IS her problem then.. well i DONT have a fucking problem.. i just have this life in which i live in and for no reason at all it makes me sick. it makes me want to barf, it makes me feel like shit.

      its hard to please everyone in this fucking world so i'm not even going to try. its not that i mean to make others feel like shit.. but when I constantly feel like shit 24/7 then what the hell do u expect from me anyways? i dunt mean to make u feel low or insignificant and i wud never try to pull down someone to as low as i feel.. yet absentmindedly i manage to make everyone feel like fuck. but like i said .. what DO u expect from me? all i am is another annoying ditzy bitch in need of mental therapy .. if i think im a negative person. stand in my spot and take a look around. look at all those mutherfuckers staring back at me and tell me how u can refrain your self from wanting to kill someone or prevent your mind from going insane. and since u won't be taking the time to stand in my spot i'll tell u the answer. u cant.      there's too much anger inside me there's too much scarring when i bleed there's too much therapy i need there is no god that i have seen  SMILE EMPTY SOUL- THERAPY

      why can't people just accept the fact that some days i'll be a bitch, some days i'll spazz at you, some day i'll have a shitty day and that i'm not fuckin happy go lucky all the time? why can't people just be my gawddamn friend no matter what mood i'm in and accept my bitchy side and everything in between? after all i am not perfect and never said i ever will be. so either get up and accept my flaws or sit down and stay the fuck away from me. i don't get you. u claim you'r my best friend but u simply can't accept the little flaws that come with me. don't ask questions..just deal with it. u think uve seen it all.. but theres more to come. maybe u shud back off from me while ur at it.

      What can i say. sometimes life comes down to a point where you just simply question everything. love, friends, life, yourself. makes you wonder who is real and who isn't, whose true and whose fake, what's reality and what's a fantasy. and sometimes it kinda hurts when all u can do is stand and watch it consume you. every part of you. he loves her more than hes ever loved me. and i shall stand back and watch me get burned, and left lonely again. when i thot i finally became part of something forever.. reality hits back at me. nothing is forever.

      hot people are so intimidating. they're what cause my shallowness. we can only dream.    mm im so sick of school i swear one day in the middle of the halls ill break down or throw a tantrum. u just watch. i mean how much of one thing can one person take. theres a certian extent and it often goes too far.   we all do stupid things and sometimes they cant be forgotten but they are always regreted. sometimes we are blinded by our tears so we cant see reality. we all dream about a fantasy, we read fantasies we live in a fantasy we are a fantasy

      CREAMPUFF BLOGGED ABOUT ME AND I WAS LIEK WHOOOOOA CREAM ATTACK AND I CREAMED... U KNOW WHAT? everything she said about me was true, I quote: "i love celina. aside from her mind-blowing, pants-expanding, breath-taking obvious hot creamy sexual attraction, there is the fact that whenever I'm with her I get luscious attackes of the highest order. " I agree every part of that. yes i am cocky but what are u gonna do about that. Well lemme in return blog about creampuff. No words suit her better than.. LUSCIOUS! I love that girl! i really wud tap her .... come to think of it.. I WILL tap her! Theres something about the fact that on days when everything is like shit she is the only one that doesnt make it worst. maybe she cant make thigns dandy but shes alwyas htere to bitch about every single part of life with me. No other can do that because u know what theyre not nearly as negative. When it comes down to the dirty stuff she is the only one that can make me laugh. Tho some times she has bad days it is simple enuf to understand that everyone has them bad days so what can we do? we bitch. coz life is sometimes like a dick and when it gets hard we fuck it. Creampuffs rule this world having the exceptions to every little flaw we might or may have. But hey MY creampuff is perfect luscious superly attractive the kinda girl that makes u have a fire in ur pants. i think i just burned my pants thinkin of her.

      Blogging @ school:  What s there to say? Another day @ school and its as good as school can ever get which is dreadful. High School drop outs are my hero. They are so reasonable and they are pretty damn smarter than all the peopel that actually stay in school. Hell Id drop out if i wasnt so much of a coward. I mean u learn so much more when ur outta school when u actually live life.. the way everyone was put here to do. If u cant take it drop it leave it do whatever pleases your pathetic heart so it can finally satisfy you. Everyone is caged in misery because we are so lost. We do what everyone else wants us to but when will we finally take the time to do what the hell we please. think bout it. We're just wasting our lives away coz we're all idiotic creatures. Lifes too short to be angry, lifes too short to fake it, lifes too short to hold grudges, lifes too short to bitch @, lifes just life and no matter what we do we will never complete it happy. Fuck it down the draion. I hate so many people I really do.. no one every undertsands anyone and everyone wants too much outta everyong when they have nothin left to give anyways. When a person does something that doesn't satsify u its pretty selfish to just fuckin leave them and ignore the number of times they were there for u, the number of times they wiped away your tears, the number of times they decdicated themselves all for you, and the countless number of times they were actually a friend to you. WHat more can i say? People are so selfish. Its all about themselves isnt it because no matter hyow much u say u care for someone.. u dont. U fuckin dont because all the only thign u ever give a damn about is yourself. Why dont peopel just die by them,selves. die happy by themselves so they can stop hurting the ones around them and only hurt themselves in a painless way. Death.

      You're all the same. Just when you think you come across a different path.. you realize theyre all the same. every fuckin person. No one has a mind of their own its just this robotic world where all the minds are created in all the same manner. Just coz someone looks different or seem to act different they turn out to be just "another one of them." But what can we do? Lets walk down that same fuckin path again and again until we're satisfied.  Some people expect too much outta one person when theyre no fuckin better. Like i said everyone is the same so why do you expect so much outta me. i cant prevent who i am although i would love to at many times and u cant prevent who you are. I know im a failure at life why cant you understand it why do you have to expect me to be perfect. Im no good @ that im a sucky friend im a sucky person and yeah i am a fuckin sorry person. but what is anyone gonna do about that? you give and give and give till you're weak in every single cell inside of you and they still want more outta you. You can call me close to fuckin dead because maybe i am. maybe u killed my soul, my heart, well u sure as hell killed everything i ever believed in. Im outta here.

      Maybe someday the world will unfuck it self. Maybe everything does finally get better and maybe its not just wishful thinking. But then again.. sometimes there is a poitn where things are too fucked up to be fixed.. and that is what our world is. I dont think the world screws it self up i think its the people placed on this world that make everything a mess. Maybe the world would be beautiful if there were no humans on it. maybe it will finally be that utopia we all hoped for.. we wudnt be alive to enjoy it.. but hey it would have been beautiful.   Maybe when you're angry all the time its kinda a sign to tell you that you need therapy.. a psychiatrist or something along those lines. ANything to keep you from bashing your headagainst the wall.. i dont think its very healthy to be that mad all the time.. Sometimes when you crave sympathy all the time.. the last time you're ever gona fuckin get is sympathy. Don't you see?  that bringing others down won't make a difference amongst your misery. Don you get it.. its huring everyone aroudn u. why can u just hurt yourself and keep us out of your miserable life. coz we dont need it. the world is already screwed as it is.

      I hate having to tell people things numerous times before they finally get it in their damn heads. I'm sick of being nice to everyone and helping them with everything when they really should just go and fail all their shit because sometimes i am just frikin fed up with it all. The light isn't turning on so i live each day in the dark. I shall feel my way in and out of life. When people have opportunities or chances how hard is it for them to frikin take it. Why hold back on what you really want only to later find yourself sulking to me? I don't get you people. You mope around.. you are your own misery because thats what you chose it to be. You set your life and you set your happiness. don't come running back to me when you've failed.

      When you took that brush and painted There were no colors at all Everything in you was black and white Because you’ve fallen in your trap.  You don’t believe in reality  Because you love hearing those lies When he told you that he loved you  Those lies are in your veins  You love hearing fantasies Never grow out of your childhood. Forever are those imaginary games  I guess for you it is never too old.    So when will the time come  Before you spill your soul on him When will the time come  Before you begin to feel these lies.   I want to tell you that this is not real The life you lead is just a fairy tale But what is it to you? You’d just think it were more lies.

The only thing I had.  If you lost a part of your soul your heart your hope Would you still be alive? Would you want to be alive? One doesn’t last long without their heart. And I won’t last without you  Come to think of it. I wouldn't want to live.

      The number of times you cry is insignificant in life for everyday we are crying to be set free. If you gathered all the tears you've cried in your lifetime, it will form an ocean...more than an ocean, it will drown us in our own misery. And once we self suffocate ourselves we open our eyes and see clearly.. one tear is nothing, crying won't change the fucked up world, we've cried all the tears we could.. we're finally done...though it takes us a life time to realize this.. we die smiling. because this is what life took all the time in our lives trying to teach us what to do.. to smile. We're another page in history.

      i told u someday @ school in the middle of the halls ill just give up hiding everything and just break down. I told the fucking world. and they watched. You can only wonder what goes on in ones mind.. u can only wonder what the shit they were thinking ..u can always question but u can never answer. When you think about how possible it is for you to lose the only thing that kept you alive.. the only thing you live for in a matter of one fucking night.. it tears you up and you can no longer keep your sanity, you can no longer see the bright side you can only ponder the darkness. What if the only thing you needed, u had, u wanted, u loved, u lived for was gone. If i came close to that day i wudnt be able to live.. hell i wudnt want to live.  Funny how it takes so much before people can show how much they care, how it takes one fuckin person to be in pain before anyone really gives much of a shit. What can i say?  no longer can i take everything for granted, no longer can i look at life the same.

      Why don't you just shove you fucking  homosexual cocky comments up your fuckin ass and while you're at it stick a dick up there to satisfy your gay cravings! Thats right. Stupidty angers me so if you're stupid don't talk to me.. but then again if you're stupid you aren't smart enough to realize that i hate you and wish for you to go away. Did you know the sq root of 4 is 2? facinating isnt it? Ugly people should only be allowed to go out with other ugly people. And if you don't know how to do make up properly i suggest you take lessons or just stick ur face down the fuckin drain ok? When you have a gf or bf the basic realization is you do NOT flirt with other people and make others fall in love with you when it is a little too late. You're only make things fuckin worst and you should take your cocky stuck up behavior else where before you get fuckin killed. Why do peopel change so dramatically. Mayeb becasue they are ashamed of themselves. when you're fuckin ashamed then maybe you shouldn't be doin what you do.. simple as that. How hard is it to get? Oh lets get married and pay for a 120 pound load on my back.. yah what happen to that loada bull? too ashamed? Look in the fucking mirror and tell me how you can face each day looking like that. are you not too ashamed to live? coz you sure fuckin well should be. you're born the way you are now either accept it or leave this fucking world. Dying your hair, changing you clothes, changing your gawddamn image doesn't fuckin help with anything. Drink from that fountain of shit and tell me how you still keep on living this way.

      Science Test, Math crap, English Exam, French test.. and i left everything at school.. accident? maybe.... well if you dont bring it home you dont have to do it since you have none of the stuff anyways and no matter how much i slack off i manage to pull through in the end anyways just nto with flying colors.  Vic has hot cheerleading boys that are surprisingly not queer they are on fire i tell u. whyd i come to mac... actualy it doesn't make a difference coz it isnt like if i move to Vic i can get any more hot guys than i am getting right now. Quite shallow you say? i know i am.

      How do people expect others just simply forgive forget and move on? its impossible. its stupid. i've always wanred everyone that if they start bitching at me they will get hell. then why the fuck are u so astonished and surprised? oh SHIT coz im suppose to be the nice one, im suppose to be sane, im suppose to be fuckin perfect for your sake! well im not so watch and learn. its fuckin retarded to crave sympathy and feel sorry for yourself, and i will be the last one to even give a shit about you. When im having dilemmas and im bitching about them shut up and let me talk because im the only one that matters rite now. i dont care if you have bigger problems, i dont care if your the one crying and sulking, i dont care because IM the one thats fuckin talkin rite now and you are absolutely nothing but a spec of dust to me. Don't tell me that i have nothing to worry about, dont tell me i dont knwo what the fuck im thinking coz u dont fuckin know my life, my friends, my family, and most importantly you dont fucking know me and you never will.

Now its different.. now i have 3 different plans i said maybe to, cept i dont even want to go anywhere, i dont want to do anything, i just want to go home. Im just so boring now, the world keeps spinning, the days havent changed, but im lounging aroudn wanting to be somewhere else, a place where i can enjoy myself. coz right now.. everythign smacks you in the face it leaves u weak and all u want to do is go hoem crawl into bed and sleep the day away.

      im perfect im great, im marvellous and i never make mistakes because im always right. I should never be blamed for anything because i never do anything wrong and its always other people's faults, but never mine. If you ever feel down and think that the world sucks and its all your fault, well yea, yeah it is ok? everything is your fault u suck @ life while I rock @ it and everythign in between. I'm a genius and I kick your ass at everything because what can i say im perfect! its simple being perfect when everythign about me and i have everything that yuou dont have but wish you did have. Coz guess what? its me. I have no flaws. ----> anyways i wish that was all true because it d be fun to believe in,, its fun to play pretend sometimes.. pretend your something u cud never be.

Will you be the one to sweep me off my feet?  i live in a fairytale  The hardcover book, those yellow tinted pages  Lack of controversies A knight in shining armor I'll be your princess.   Will you be the one to break my heart? Every whisper in my ear Caressing every word you speak Breathing every scent in you Don't shatter my heart I can do that myself.

      there is so much that we deserve but we'll never get. its not as if we expect too much, we only expect the minimum yet it doesn't chose to satisfy us. It just gives more to those that already have everything they need when those peopel that deserve it are the ones that won't get a thing. And liek a deserving person, we wait. We keep telling ourselves that i we keep waiting if we keep believing it'll finally coem to us. But how much longer must we wait? what if it never comes to us. Hopes fall. and sometimes it just takes soo much strength to hold on to a losing battle. we finally stop denying the fact that we're winning and come to see that we're truly losing. maybe we've already lost. we deserved it but who says the ones that deserve it are the ones that is going to get it? i'm waiting. still.

      A girl asked a guy if he thought she was pretty, he said...no. She asked him if he would want to be with her forever....and he said no. She then asked him if she were to leave would he cry? and once again he replied with a no. She had heard enough . As she walked away, tears streaming down her face the boy grabbed her arm and said....You're not pretty you're beautiful. i dont want to be with you forever. i NEED to be with you forever, and i wouldnt cry if you walked away...i'd die

      Drain the Blood by the Distillers   I'm living on shattered faith  The kind that likes to restrict your breath  never been a better time than this  suffocate on eternal bliss   In a city  that swells with so much hate  you seem to rise above  and take its place  the heart pumps until it dies  drain the blood, the heart is wise   All my friends are murder  All my bones are marrows in  All these fiends want teenage meat  All my friends are murderers

      its the peopel standing right in front of you the ones that matter the most. its the people that u look far and beyond for that don't matter at all. its the ones u love that u wanna hate and the ones u hate the ones u wanna love. its the ones that care the ones u break their heart and the ones that dont care their hearts u yearn to mend. Its the imbalance and opposites of everyday life that we can never over come. what is it with us and doin the opposite of everything we should be doing. life isnt bound by rules itself its bound by the what we make it to be. burn those rule books of yours and live.

      they say change is good, but im afraid of change. the only day i know is today, and i wouldn't give it up for the world. maybe 2morow we will never speak to each other again, and the day after we won't even make a glance to each other, and the day after that we don't want anything to do with each other. and my mind will still be on the "what ifs" wondering if anythign different could have happened if i wasnt so much of a coward, a fool. cudnt afford to lose you, but i guess i will. sad as it may be. i hope u never read this.

      cant get u outta my head. i dunt know what it is but whatever it is, its got my head wrapped around u. ur my insanity, my craving, my obsession, my infatuation, what more can i say? everything u do, seems to make my world go round, every word you say seems to bring be down to u, everything about u has got me loving it.  there are things i know i shouldnt get myself involved in, but i just cant help it. i know nothing good will come out of it, but once i got a taste, i just have to have you. its not going to workout coz things like that just don't fall in my arms, but what am i to do, when my mind is constantly on u. i guess ill never learn, ill just have to replay what i know will happen because i just cant seem to stop. you are just what i need.

      i dont need to hear about your life sometimes. you and your craving of sympathy. you let the littlest things get to you. and you complain non stop. u have no fuckin clue what anyone else wakes up to each day. ur life is frikin awesome. but ur so blidned that u hate every part of it. yah? fine! sulk in your misery but you're dragging me down with you. holding me back from so much more. i am perfectly fine with out you cant you see?

      each day is so unpredictable someday you're gonna love it and other days you're gonna hate it. it only ever tricks your mind. when theres a good there will always and forever be a bad.   Infatuated with you.. but theres nothing i can do. I dont know what to think. take it or leave it. i know ill regret it. silence and fear is my enemy. Learn to defy gravity, learn to defy fear, thats when you will live. in the meantime, you havent even begun.

      Holy eyes, I never knew I'd beg down at your feet Hold on tight I never knew I'd know much more than this  Open sky, the wave of pain the scent of you is bliss  Hungry eyes, they stare at me I know, I know  Don't go!  Summertime, the taste of saint secretes of perfume mist Console the mind, I take it in lips of pink I kiss Lonely sky, the more you take the more that I give in Holy eyes, I never knew, I know, I know Don't go!

      Random Thoughts:  i guess if there werent bad in this world we wudnt ever know what good is.  "it takes a lifetime to find the answer we seek. and takes a second to learn what we never wanted to know." GOTTA LET IT BURN. when something aint going your way, it probably never will. let it go.  Look at life a different way, it may change how to see it forever. Everyday day in day out we look @ life the way we think we should look @ it, but maybe thats just your fantasy. Find you reality. Lies are lovely and i love them .

      Random thoughts  what is up with people and wanting to know everything about ur private life when theyve never even talked to u before till then! gawd some things i just wish to keep to my self thank you very much. just stop prying. tell the world my secrets why dont u. and what the shit are u gonna achieve by doing that? geebus I DONT WANT HIM TO KNOOOW  kiss your dreams good bye. stop wishing. quit craving. you'll never earn what you deserve. Why do i bother trying to do anythin anyways when the results come back all the same. Its a waste of effort. im done with this shit.  complain all you want. what makes you think i care at all? your problem isnt my problem. end of story.  Seek reassurance and all you're gonna get is a fist fulla shit from me. Go ahead feel sorry for yourself. but im not going to join u. if you're gonna act all weird about it.. ill leave u alone u know. youre not worth the effort, youre not worth my time, youre my eye candy. what to think now.. ?

      I guess we all have to deal with what we hate. and eventually learn to love it.  why are reputations so important in ones mind. So what if they think negative about you. i hate when people get all worked up when they find out someone hates them. OH MY GAWD! THEY DONT LIKE U? suck it up princess. not everyone is gonna like u in this world. you'll never be perfect.. like me. ha ha well ive been having an ok kinda week. oh wait.. its monday the week just started.. SHIIIIIIIIIIIT!  well on another day folks you have reached the end of me   ill leave you with this "The worst is over now and we can breathe again  i wanna hold you high and steal my pain away Theres so much left to learn  And no one left to fight I wanna hold u high and steal your pain."  -SEETHER FT.

      Random thoughts:  mixed signals confuses me.  What sup with peopel constantly trying to pry into your private life? i think everyone needs their own secrets and once throw it away you're left with nothing for yourself. I have pgs of secrets, confidential poetry, no one ever knows what goes on in my mind, they have no idea what i wake up to. im keepin' it that way.  I like cute more than hot.. i just thought about that. Hot is intimidating and cutes just.. aww! meeh well. .id tap a hottie or a cutie so gimme gimme gimme  Take what you have and stop wishing. I mean when you're always craving this, craving that.. when will you finally get to a moment to liek who you are. you'll never be fuckign satisfied. live with it.  I don't even know you, why do you talk to me, just show who you are and take off that gawddamn mask. The more I see you the more I hurt.  I can't breath with out you, yet i suffocate in your presence "Now that I can see you i don't think you're worth a second glance." - Dashboard Confessional Italian movies are good. I just realized that. The ones Ive seen i love..   Infatuation   end of the fucking line

      Well another day at our freakin' school. I find loud ppl who never stop laughing and stand in huge crowds in the middle of the hallways really annoying. liek move ur ass and talk quieter no one wants to see or hear u. its just so freakin' annoying. And stupid people shud just stop talking all together. When i do something nice for you the least u can do is appreciate it . some peopel just never learn. and they wonder why im so hateful? they never unblidn themselves and look.

      i make up life as i go along. screw planning screw saving up money just live it as it comes. thats how life was meant to be lived. We analyze it too much, plan everything too carefully, and when it doesn't go our way we fall off the tracks and can't get back up. Its stupid how it is. Why don't you just not make any goals so you won't be dispppointed if you don't fulfill them. I mean half the time you're going to be a failure.

      Could I steal your last bit of hope?  You can have my pain in return I wake up to this each day. Am I strong enough to last another one? I’m only living to hurt  I’m out here counting the stars I keep losing count, so I try again that’s what they told me to do Half my life is gone,  And I’m out here counting stars The sun rises another day I wait another night to count. morning comes I hear the crying I walk up to these familiar sounds They say roses die and glass ones are forever Why did mine shatter?  It went down with the others. Might as well drown me in your tears because I watch them fall each day Let gravity take me off the edge I’m only living to hurt Only breaking glasses roses Only counting these stars.

I dont mean to crave sympathy nor want to make my pretyt good life sound shitty but its so gawddamn true. u have no idea how much shit goes on, u have no clue what is on my mind. u have no fuckin idea what i wake up to each day.

      we're all so hypocrtical. No one wants to get hurt.. but over and over again we put ourselves in a situation to get hurt. its as if we are aiming to get hurt. u know how u trick mice with a electrical shocker thing and u place it near cheese or somethign and they run into it and get electricuted a couple times before they realize that it shocks them? and we laugh right? but the thing is.. we're not better. we're humans.. but we're not smarter than mice by that much.

      well the school year ended so ill recap my year. i can't say that it has been my worst gr ever because it really hasnt. If u look bak on it there has been a lot of good times and some bad.. yet in the end I've realized that I've had worst. U know I came to mac to get away fom all those bitches that roamed crestwood, well they werent exactly bitches btu i just didn't like em, so @ mac it was so much more free. and i came with seema and kristen who happen to be my best friends so i wasn't alone at all tho i didnt have classes with em. I did meet lotsa cool new ppl for example breanne n aaron who happen to continue to read my blogs or so i think..( oh well u guys are damn cool!!!!). Well in the beginning of the year i had religion which happened to be my favorite class. I actually looked forward to that class each day. We had so much fun with our dandy little plays and of course thats where i met creampuff. Everythin else was quite borign class wise until i came to love the class math and science.. for .. certain reasons. overall putting together the hyperness, some luscious boys i seem to have it really bad for, dancing to Candie in bio, crazy jokes that make no sense, and air humping.. it was a pretty good year over all. thanks to all my friends that make mac standable.

      After seeing the notebook i began to think that love was so much more beautiful and genuine in the olden days. It was actually something true and real. not something that you pick up off the street and throw away a day later. it was actually real love that lasts. none of that kinky dirty stuff, those blowjobs and what other new inventions came along the way. it was just..simple Old fashion love.         so sweet

      i don't know what to think of u. One side of me thinks of u as a total fuckin asshole who i really wanna shoot down and never ever talk to again, becuase you're too much of a freakin typical kinda guy, the kinds i have no interest in because they lack all the respect that i want from them, and the other side of me thinks of u as the hottest cutest little thing i have ever seen, the only guy i would ever tap in my whole freakin life, the one that says the sweetest things and makes me melt in side, the one that I want every single part of, the one that makes everything beautiful.

      i had one wild dream last night No matter how much u want something ur never going to get it.  If u believe that u are beautiful, then you are. you are going to be the most gorgeous person in the world if u think that you are. The way you feel about urself is the way life will feel for you.   "I can't stay in one place, The memories they chase me, Around the room, I planted a shade tree, And I lay there thinkin' about you, Yeah, The leaves fall around me, I'd love to blow away with them, If I could" --Hot Action Cop - In a little while  If i could do alot of things i would but i cant so i won't  i dotn mean to down, or be a downer and be pessimistic about everything but sometimes when u truly open up ur eyes its really hard not to be. im out

      i've got it so bad for you right now  i dont think one summer will cure me from this incurable infatuation i have over you. i doubt anything ever will. no matter how shitty you are, i can't stop dreaming about you. I wish things wud go back to what it was like a week ago. i swore u made each and every one of my day gorgeous. and u even made me feel that way. mayeb nothing was ever there to begin with but whatever was there and wasn't: i loved it.

       The truth about me  The truth about me, is that u know nothing about me. I am a girl but i hate girls, infact i wish i lack those girly characteristics such as gossipness, prissiness, and bitchiness. I'm not as horny as u think i am, infact i dont wana get fingered or eaten out and i dont wana give a handjob nor blow job, infact i think dicks are really really gross. I don't even want to see one, but no i'm not a lesbian. I don't like the kinky stuff and All i want is a guy that is funny, nice, and respects me for who i am, and understands when im joking and when i'm not. I do wanna get kissed, I do like to flirt, and i do like to talk dirty but the truth about me is i'm more talk than do. I don't want to have sex or get down on you . The truth about me is I think life is too short to take seriously, so therefore I'm barely ever serious. I can stand mac, but i really miss crestwood. I hate it when peopel swear too much, and i hate actions movies with a few exceptions. I hate rap music, and I really liek mushrooms. I love leaving things to the imagination, and I have a flaw with taking things too far. I will accept your flaws if you respect mine, i will love you, if you will love me, if you lack respect then fuck you. I hate webcams but i love adam brody. I've never been drunk, and I've never done weed. I've never been to a real party, and I don't care to either. I'd rather stay home curl up and watch sappy movies all night long, because yes i am a prissy girl. I don't like extreme activities and I'd rather play the field safe. I do like my self, but sometimes i wish i were different. I'm low maintenence, and I don't expect gifts. I don't liek expensive jewelery, or expensive chocolate or flowers. I don't care for expensive dates or the car you drive. I love hot guys but I don't care much for buffness, abs are good but rippling muscles aren't. Infact I think the sterotype of buffness is dead because i don't like buff boys. I'm simple and easy to please. Truth of the matter is I think confidence is the most attractive feature, and those that don't know how hot they are are even hotter. and as much as I say I hate you, I've got it really bad for you.

      sometimes i dont even care what u have to say. i hate when people talk about other people. like don't u know when to quit? when u figure out whats pissing me off, the key is to stop and not continue.

I really shud study but well.. lifes too good to turn to studying. honestly! the only thing good about finals are once u finish it.. its frikin over!

So whose to blame?   Come summer im goin to get a hottiemabody i swear. and if i dont..well its not the end of the freakin' world. Everytime something doesn't go your way, get up off ur ass and live. the world hasnt end yet as much as it seems liek it has. When ur hating life.. get up and fix it. Everyone thinks that things cant be fixed well u knwo what? its what u make it to be. My encouraging words.. USE IT

Turns out we came a little too early so me and creampuff went to sev to goget a big ass slurpee in which i finished alot of it. Yay! it was quite fun since we were quite hyper.. not that it shud come as a surprise. Well 2 more classes to go. My shirt plunges quite low.. ppl think im not wearing a bra when i am. ch.. im nto THAT much of a slut. But then again. .who knows?

Then why in the first place did u tell me all the negative comments. i was only ever agreeing with u.. isnt that wat u want?

      maybe summer will be enough time for me to stop thinking about u every frikin second of my life. well i can only hope for that.. as far as i know ull always be on my mind and ur never going to go away. come next yr things will be a turn around its going to be different and i just cant keep feeling the same feelings i feel for u. i dotn wanna feel. I just want u. hopeful wishing comes with the consequence of it more than likely never going to work out. i think i shud just stop my self before i get too far with u in my head. come summer ur outta the picture. simple because ur outta my league.

      this wasnt the high school life i thot it was going to be.. its not even close infact. I guess watching movies, and television kinda gives u a stereotype as to what high school is like. coz as far as i know.. high school is NOT going to be the best yrs of ur life. i made it thro gr 10 i can only hope next yr gets better. If not then whatever, we all make it thro somehow. Its friday night and i have nothing to do. not much of a partyer anyways sometimes id rather be left alone.

So much for applying them during class.. sick..now i have to go to the bathroom anyways! argh! oh no i forgot my lunch at home. now i have to use my mall money for food. well this day just got worst! well nto really but still. Lizzy is singing beside me and she sounds gross .. must be that cold or somethin. everybody break it doooowwwwn to her singing! " CAROLINEE CAROLINNNNE all the guys wud say she is mighty fine! MIGHTY FINE! but mighty fine only got you somewhere half the time. And the othger half got you cursed out of coming short. and now dig this even though. EVEN THOUGH.

       the things you say to me may appear meaningless to you.. but to me it means the everything. I realize you can't hold back reality you can't hold back what is meant to happen and what is not. I guess you have to embrace what life has in stock for you. I used to tell all of you to stop dreaming because it will never happen right? Well i'm going to spin things around.  Chase the rainbows, count the stars, reach the unreachable because someday you just might overcome the impossible. and if you don't? I just might have to kill you. haha no i just felt like saying that. Who cares if you've failed, who cares if you didn't get what you want, who cares if you aren't what they want you to be, who cares if you've made the same mistakes one too many times, who cares? you're still my hero.

      Cute is better than hot, because hot is just an appearence that is flawless and unrealistic. Cute comes with personality where as Hot is simply just looks. In the end personality is the only thing that is going to matter anyways. Hot people get laid. but Cute peopel get laid with reason

       sometimes i think it might be beautiful to stay a cookie cutter virgin until you're married but sometimes i don't think I will get married at all and some things just aren't worth the wait. Well whorish as I may sound.. but I really cudn't care less what you think. So read my cool compiled list below:     List of Cool Places to Have Sex&nbsp;     1.&nbsp;Beach  2. Pool table  3. by the fire  4. Orchard  5. Sunflower&nbsp;garden  6. Corn field  7. On a hill&nbsp;below the stars overlooking the city  8.&nbsp;Barn with hay  9.&nbsp;Kitchen table&nbsp;  10. In a train   11. ferris wheel &nbsp;    well have fun with that.. experiment guys.. these are just a few greatly messed up ideas by me.

       i would like for all of you to know that.. sometimes when you've tried all you can, tried&nbsp;your hardest, even&nbsp;breaking down your self sense of pride just to fix something... nothing is worth that. maybe it is your fault you know? ..maybe you can't be all they want you to be. but damn don't tear down what you've been building up for anyone. keep your sense of pride and if they can't respect that you have tried everything for them. then what are they worth?   forget every single shit thats happened to you, forget feeling liek a sack of crap wishing you can change who you are and what has become because girl, we're gettin down on whyte ave gettin down to the soccer center. how can you get better if you don't practise?     that was for you, creamers if you didnt know.. this blurb was for you.

       funny how easily people can alter the&nbsp;underlying meaning&nbsp;of the three words   "  I love you  "   when they use it too much without any significance or truth to it. you don't even know me, sweetheart, please don't tell me words you know will reel me in. you know how easily I get drawn in by words. when half the time, words are just a bait, to hook you, reel you, and make you fall in love with what was never there to begin with.

      i took a walk outside for awhile. it was cloudy grey and chilly outside. no one was in the park. no one bothers to take walks when it isnt "beautiful" outside. but what is the definition of a beautiful day? coz i thot today was gorgeous. though the sun wasn't shining and it wasnt hot out, it s nice when the park is lonely. it kind of reflect what you feel. it was just me, the wind and dashboard confessional blasting in my head. I jsut sat for what seemed like forever doing nothing. i watched the cars pass by as everyone seem to have a destination to get to. and me? i didnt have any destination what so ever. i just sat there watching everyone pass by wondering why they are in such a rush. a rush to live. i cud have stayed there forever because i felt perfectly content alone. it was kind of comforting knowing no one was there to watch you or judge you or anything. it was me against the world. i cud have stayed there for a logn long time. but i knew i had to come home for dinner.

      Thousand Foot Krutch -- This is a Call   She fooled all of her friends,  Into thinking she’s so strong,  But she still sleeps with the light on,  And she acts like it’s all right on,  As she smiles again Her mother lies there sick with cancer,  And her friends don’t understand her,  She’s a question without answers,  Who feels like falling apart   She knows, she’s so much more than worthless,  But she needs to find her purpose,  She wonders what she, did to deserve this   She’s calling out to You,  This is a call; this is a call out,  'Cause everytime I fall down,  I reach out to you And I’m losing all control now,  And my hazard signs are all out,  I’m asking you, to show me what this life, is all about   He tells everyone a story,  Because he feels his life is boring,  And he lies, so you won’t ignore him,  Because that’s his biggest fear And he cries, but you’ll rarely see him do it,  He loves, but he’s scared to use it,  So he hides behind the music,  Cause he likes it that way   He knows, he‚s so much more than worthless,  He needs to find the surface,  Because he’s, starting to get nervous   Have you ever felt this way before?,  Cause I don’t want to hide here anymore,  Take me to a place where nothing’s wrong, and,  Thanks for coming, shut the door They say someone out there sees us,  Well if you’re real then save me Jesus,  Cause I’ve been this way, for far too long,  I wasn’t meant, to feel alone    *this song was like written for me .. or so it seems. i love it. it makes me wanna cry.

      life isnt like some cinderella story i want it to be.  that book just wasnt written for me.   Summer is sposed to be a time for flings, partying, gettin drunk, gettin laid, doin weed, hookin' up, hotel rooms, or so thats what it seems.. Well ive defied the meaning of summer and have not done any of the above. Whats wrong with me they ask? absolutely nothing.   I need to get away for a while. Just out of edmonton or something. theres no telling what im missing out of the real world by lockin myself up in this room with just the computer and me.  "Well this time I'm not going to watch myself die I think I made it a game to play your game  And let myself cry  I buried myself alive on the inside So I could shut you out And let you go away for a long time"   Buried Myself Alive by the Used

       Love  A girl and a guy were speeding over 100 mph on a motorcycle Girl: Slow down. I'm scared. Guy: No, This is fun.  Girl: No, its not. Please stop. its too scary! Guy: Then tell me you love me.  Girl: I love you. now slow down! Guy: Now give me a hug *Girl Hugs him*  Guy: Can you take off my helmet? It's bugging me.  In the paper the next day: A motorcycle crashed into a building because of brake failure. Two people were on it. Only one survived. The truth was halfway down the road, the guy realized that his brakes broke, but he didn't want to let the girl know. Instead, he had her say she loved him, felt her hug one last time, then had her wear his helmet so she would live even though it meant he would die.

       I am your mystery. You just don’t know it yet. I am the one you need. when you run out of oxygen It’s me you’re going to breathe. When you try to chase your dreams I’m not unobtainable.   You just have to have the right pieces To mend my heart to yours. You’ll need to untie my knots.   Either that or add to them.   Tangled up and lost It’s alright when I’m with you. Lose me in your soul though it is hard to feel lost at all When every place inside you Will fit me perfectly. I am your mystery I am the one you need when you run out of oxygen it’s me you’re going to breathe

       this stupid cold or whatever i have isnt getting any better. I thought it was but it TRICKED me its getting worst. I could barely sleep last night and kept waking up to be freezing cold. oh well on a good side note i'm damn gorgeous. ba ha! but how come i can't get anyone even if i tried?... beats me. I should be studying my music history and stuff coz i haven't all day but i feel really cruddy right now so that shit will have to wait. the exam is 2morow to those that don't know. im not that worried.. well if i was i'd be off my ass by now and i'm not so.. shows how much I care. I miss everyone that is out of town right now because by the time they get back I will be out of town and I haven't even seen them for most of this summer. just our luck. Don't tell me things I don't need to hear. don't tell me things I don't want to hear. Coz as far as I know I live in my own damn world and everything goes my way.  Sometimes i get really jealous.. what can i say I'm a jealous person. I envy probably the people that least expect it. ehh.. lifes not fair. i want my own Luscious I don't even knwo why I care so much Maybe I don't It's always just a freaking infatuation anyways Damn it all.

       Live - All Over You our love is like water pinned down and abused for being strange our love is no other than me alone for me all day our love is like angels pinned down and abused all over you, all over me the sun, the fields, the sky I've often tried to hold the sea the sun, the fields, the tide pay me now, lay me down    got this offa Derrick its awesome thanks buddy   ***************************************************************    I kinda hope you'll never read this but if you do.. well some things you just can't say to someones face and here it is. So you're leaving. I hope thats not a call out for sympathy and you really are leaving because if it is.. that is just plain pathetic. So leave. that is what i would really love to say to your face btu I can't because beneath the anger, frustration and total cussing out i don't want you to go. I'm sad because you have to go and I think i'm scared or something to feel lost when i don't have someone there who I can spill my gut out to everyday. 7 years. it has been 7 fucking years and somehow I'm expected to just drop everything and let it go? it's hard enough going to different schools but in a different province that is pretty damn hard. I just don't see how it is going to work. I mean sure i'd try id put an effort into it btu after so long of putting so much energy into trying to make something work. i think i've ran out of it. I don't see how friends can be friends when they know less than 1/9th of what is going on in their lives. I don't see how friends can be friends if they get to talk to them once every 3 months. I don't see how friends can be friends if they see each other once every 6 months. I don't see how friends and be friends if they live in basically a different world. So i don't mean to sound bitter but that is what I really think. I just don't see how anything is going to work. I'm sick and tired of this...I'm sick and tired of piecing things together and you hit me with this. I don't want to go to a goodbye party its tough enough saying goodbye in my head. its not like ill never see you again its just going to be pretty damn hard and differnet. Well.. its not like this matters anyways I'm sure it harder for you than me.. or maybe you just don't give a shit at all. but I just don't want you to go. that's all.
