      My inside source on this girl (her name is Erica, i'm tired of saying "this girl") says that the freshmen shes been talkin about is someone she's serious about.  damn, i'm so pissed right now.  I'ma need some demon music so i can stab my wrists or some shit like that (jp....).  Anyway, he runs cross country, and even thought i'd never go through with something like this (well, it depends who it is, and if it's someone i don't like, or i grow to dislike).  Sooo, possibly things i can do are  -Put sharp objects in his running shoes -Trip him on accident -Just kick his ass (cmon, he's a freshmen, i'm sure i'm bigger than him) -Have someone kick his ass -Ruin his relationship with Erica (hopefully i can dig up some dirt on him) -something more evil...bwahahahahhahaha  Ok, i'm scaring myself with some of this stuff i'm thinking of...maybe i need a break...

      I was at Target today (it's like Walmart, in case you've never heard of it), and they have TV's with fancy music videos playing non stop (I feel sorry for the people that have to listen to it all day long), but I heard a good song today.  It was Float On by Modest Mouse.  I liked it so much I bought the CD right there, and I'm listening to it on my PC as I'm writing this.  It's good stuff =)

      Well, I was supposed to wake up at 8 this morning to go running (today is the day I'm supposed to start practice for cross country), and I just couldn't get out of bed :( .  I think I spent way too much time playing video games last night (till like 3am), but I don't really regret it.  I'd rather run when I feel like it (which would be after I was fully awake).  Anyways, something really really sucks.  My parents told me today (2 days before my summer vacation officially starts) that they signed me up for community service.  While it isn't anything too hard (all I have to do is mess with some schools computers), not only am I using up my time and not getting paid (I know I know, that's what community service is), but I had no choice in this matter.  My parents are tired of me sitting around on the computer or xbox, doing nothing but sit there.  Even though that's something I love to do, and it should be what summer is all about, they're forcing me to do it.  They got inspired by my brothers Senior award ceremony, where a lot of scholarships were given out to people for community service.  My dad said "If you want to go to college, you have to do this".  I'm not happy about it, and I hate it when people make me do things without even asking me if I want to do them...but I guess I have to live with it.

      Well, just want to rant, but I just finished reading a really nice poem by this girl I really like, and it was all lovey dovey about a boy, but she said it was about some freshmen (she's a sophomore) in her Spanish class :( .  Damn, that hurts, if it was about me, I woulda really asked her out :( :( :(  Goddamn, I hope I don't lose her to this freshmen

      Girls are way too hard to read :( .  I remember last night, I kinda blew off a girl I really liked because I wanted to play xbox, and now I'm talking to her, and I brought up something about a movie, and she said she was gonna see it, but I got cold feet :( .  A friend of hers said that this girl would go out with me if I asked, but she was unsure whether I liked her or not.  Not only do I like her, but I'm in love with her!  Everything about her is so perfect, but a lot of the time I just don't think I'm good enough for her...ah well, I can't believe I told my bud I was waiting for a perfect chance to ask her out, and when that chance came I just couldn't do it :( .  Ah well, I'll be running cross country with her over the summer, maybe I'll be able to tell her how I feel face to face when another good chance arrives.

      Well...nothing at all has happened since Friday :) .  Just been sitting around the house, playing video games, reading magazines, and surfing the web.  I'm debating on when I'll start this cross country practice/exercise stuff...or even if I still want to go through with joining.  Anyway, I'm convinced that Xbox Live is the best thing ever when it comes to video games.  I've made lots of new friends, and it has actually boosted my confidence when it comes to talking to groups of people.  I also get people mad at me for my 1337 C4|\/|Pi|\|G skills ;), but it's all good.  That's all that's been happening lately for me.  I'm glad I finally got a chance to talk with a girl I like last night, but she seemed kinda upset that I kept leaving her to go play xbox live...damn, it's so hard to choose between spending time developing a relationship with someone you know and care about, or just chillin with the guys and play xbox...geez this is tough :(

      Woke up a 12:30 pm, woo I love sleeping in :) .  Anyhoo, I was reading through this cross country packet and it says I should exercise 4-6 days a week...eh, maybe next week ;) .  The power was out at my house last night, and while after a few hours of sitting around and reading magazines with a flash light, everything turned on and I was like "whoa..."  What else, what else....  oh yea, in case anyone cares, here's a bunch of websites I visit all the time...  http://www.dealrush.com (bunch of video game related deals, updated regularly) http://www.cheapassgamer.com (pretty much the same as the above site) http://www.xboxaddict.com (nice forums, good community, xbox stuff) http://www.xboxelites.com (the website of this xbox clan I'm in, my screen name on there is AlphaCigara) http://www.gametrailers.com (lots of video game trailers) http://www.kragamuffin.com (has bunches of high-quality anime to download, probably my favorite site of this list)

      Hey people, I was forced into doing this because by a bud of mine...but anyways, I'm 16, live in Ohio, don't have a job, and look forward to my last day of school, which is Tuesday :) .  4 day weekend wooo....hmmm, what else.  Joined cross country yesterday, look forward to meeting lots of new people (and hopefully get a lady friend).  Other than that, I'm just a big xbox nerd with hippy hair and glasses  (whew, that wasn't too hard)

      Haven't posted in a while, mainly because it's summer and a lot less interesting things will be happening to me.  Anyways, I just woke up less than an hour ago, so nothing has happened yet today.  About yesterday, I went running again, and found it that it wasn't as hard as a I thought it was going to be.  I run a lot better if I try not to think too much, and just focus on what's ahead of me.  Something interesting happened before my run yesterday.  I was walking a game up to the video store to return it, and I met a very odd person.  As I put the game in the return box, a cross dresser walked by me!  He had a pink stuffed sports bra, lots of nasty make up (it didn't cover up the facial hair :-/ ), and short shorts.  The worst part was the huge beer belly hanging out from the sports bra...ughhh.  Early yesterday, a girl IMed me, and it took me a while to guess who it was.  It was the girl from my below post, the one I liked way back when.  We just talked about random stuff, nothing too serious (mainly cross country and video games), but it was nice.  She has a job (something I should get around to getting...) at her favorite fast food place (she was surprised I remembered it was her favorite), so things are going good for her.  Ah well, that's all that has happened lately :)

      I was really frustrated, and I know I would never do something like that to interfere with her relationships.  I really like her, but if she'd rather be with someone else I guess it's ok.  The reason I'm saying this is because I saw a girl that I really liked last year, and it made me remember all the good times I had with her, so that lifted my spirits.  But if it came down to a choice between these 2 girls, I'd have to go with Erica...  Also, today was my last day of school (w00t!!!!!).  I really  should start practicing for cross country today, but xbox is callin...oh well, I'll post more about my day later :)
