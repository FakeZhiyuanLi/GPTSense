        Saturday Morning.. Wow.. 2 Mornings in a row! I'm doing good at this. Not that anyone reads it but Im trying to keep up with something for a change. Im good at just letting things go and following through about a month later!! Oh well!!          Yestarday morning was wonderful! Nothing like seeing your partner truly happy in what you do, your touch and kisses, the way you share that intimate part of yourself! When two becomes one is when you know that you have become something that is rare and oblivious to many people.          Im not sure what to keep writing here, kinda at a loss for words. I suppose as time goes on and I get more and more return people to my website, maybe then the input will help. I do this for you as well, allowing you to get to know me better. I have been told i'm a very unique woman and hope to show that through with words and photographs.           I suppose this is it for now, until later later!!     Thanks for stopping by!!     ~~Strawberry

       Well its Friday morning, I just got home from work and waiting on my sexy man to get home. Im very anxious to see him this morning, I plan on giving him a very pleasant surrpise. Nothing I like to do more is to make love with him first thing in the morning, while the day is still new and fresh, what a way to start out the day. I am sitting here just fresh out of the shower and in my sexy red nightie that he loves so much, patiently waiting to hear him slip the key into the door and let himself in.. What a day this is going to be!!  > urlLink
