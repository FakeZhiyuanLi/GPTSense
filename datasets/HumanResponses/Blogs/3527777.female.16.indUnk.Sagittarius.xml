      today, all sorts of stuff happened. brit told me last night that she was going to wake me up early this morning...and she did at 9am. i layed there and complained about being tired until she made me get up and take a shower, then we ate ice cream sandwiches for breakfast. my mom called and told me to go get a job so my sister brit and i went to collect job applications. when we got home i did some more of becky's ironing until brit, sean, heather, morgan, and i went to mokabe's. we picked up one of seans friends named julie. it took her awhile to warm up to morgan and i singing ani difranco as loud as we could. once we got to mokabe's we started to ask her about her sexuality. it wasn't a subject i would have brought up but morgan is a bold person. she said she would probably expieriment in college but she had never felt in any way, attracted to a girl. so we asked her the typical lesbian questions...have you seen "but im a cheerleader"? have you seen "better than chocolate"? have you had sex with a guy? she's definitely lesbian material but i wasn't getting that homo-vibe. did i mention she has amazing eyes? her left eye is ice-blue and her right eye is dark brown. simply put...theyre beautiful. i want a picture of them so bad. anyways...so on the way home we listened to my favorite ani song "both hands" (look up the lyrics) and i told morgan when we got to my house i would break out the old 6-string and play it for her. so i did and she blushed. my dad came outside to visit with us and morgan danced like a hippie in the middle of my street. when my mom came home she told them they had to leave and i couldn't leave with them. my family and i went out to sonic to eat. the ice cream machine was shut down due to maintenance. what kinda cock bullshit is that?! yeah, so i was pissed i didnt get my peanut butter fudge malt, but it happens to the best of us. when we came home i decided to post but was so rudely interrupted by my sister and mom screaming. my sister came into the dining room and she was covered in what looked to be flour or something. one good whiff and i knew what happened. yeah, you guessed right. a good ole baby powder fight. uh-huh. my mom is so awesome. so is my sister.

      Its currently 12:32 in the afternoon and ive pretty much fucked over all of my daily ambitions. At 9, Brit came over and we watched kelly and regis until she left for work. Then i continued reading "Boy's Life" by Robet McCammon. I've never read a book, that within the first 50 pages, I've been blown away. That is until I started reading this book. Read it DAMNIT! Now I'm listening the the A Static Lullaby LAUNCHcast radio which i have dubbed my mid-day medicine for boredom. My Minolta is collecting dust on my desk-shelf. I'm itching to go take some b&w's. Oh, how I love photography. Nothing makes my skin crawl like a picture I can relate to. Oh, and a double shot caramel dream frapp from coffee cartel. yum. I should really stop lolly-gagging and day-dreaming and finish my aunt's ironing. That will put some money in my pocket. I've been throwing around the idea of silk-screening t-shirts for no-name local bands for a little extra money. My mom has also been nagging me to go apply for a job so i will "have something constructive to do with my time". I'm definitely not arguing the fact. On with my un-productive day. Right Later Lads!

      last night brittany, morgan, heather, sean and i went to coffee cartel and lightly discussed plans for saturday's pridefest festivals. we are all definitely going to the sunday parade but brittany is still searching for someone to work for her saturday and sean has a graduation party. no stone-set plans have been made yet. i hate how i have to have arrangements before-hand instead of doing shit last minute. i'd rather just roll with the punches to ensure a good time.

      today my sister picked me up from dale's and told me my cat had been harmlessly playing with a baby bird. when we got back home i went out to look at it. not only was there a baby bird, but there was four dead adult birds. it was sitting in the grass with its mouth wide open and its gullet pulsing. my sister and i started digging worms out from under rocks in my backyard. i hate touching worms in the first place but i sucked it up and fed the little sucker. the worm was wiggling so hard i could hardly drop it in the babys mouth. when it finally dropped down in its mouth, the baby closed up and attempted to swallow. the worm started to crawl out of the corner of the birds mouth. i never knew how difficult and helpless a baby bird was. it reminded me of my godmothers bird-parenting days when she would get up every 15 minutes to feed the baby bird so it wouldn't die...sooner or later, it will die. im no fucking bird, but it seems pretty much apparent that this lil guy/girl wont make it.

      today brit and i went to eat lunch at bread co. and my mom called while we were out. she got her panties in a bunch because i forgot to call her and let her know i was leaving home. now shes trying to put limits on my weekend, which is funny because its fathers day and i'll be made to spend time with my dad, excluding any of my planned activities. hur hur. i love being smart. so today joe made me listen to velvet revolver and i know most of you guys reading will sit and say "god aimee, youre totally a square, they've been on the radio forever!" well asshole, i dont listen to the radio. anyways, it was a-freakin-mazing. scott weiland and slash are in it. as far as joe's opinion goes, its a wicked CD. so go and buy it.

      today Mer called me after about a month of not speaking for no reason other than the summer has been crazy-busy. i want her to meet brittany but she and i work on saturday. me from 12:00pm to 4:00pm. and brit from 2:something to 8:something. i want to see "the stepford wives" (shut up) because i just got done reading the book. or that movie "saved!" about the religious freaks who cherry-pick what they want out of the bible to suit them. why? possibly because i feel like most "christian religions" do that to some extent and i know so many people whose actions resemble the main characters.

      soooo. last night i went to brits to chill in the hot tub. i had to be home by 10 so we got out at about 9:30. we were just about to pull out of the driveway when her mom and her bf pull up. she was definitely tipsy. she shook my hand and said it was nice to meet me. we started to drive down the street when i see her mom throw something at our car. brittany slams on the brakes and gets out, picks up the wet beach towel, and goes inside. when she came out she was shaking and freaking out. we sped around the corner before i told her to pull over. we talked for 10 minutes so she could calm down. then she see's kristen and sam drive by. she jumps out and runs in front of their car, almost getting hit. she explained to them what happened and she got upset again. apparently her mom thinks im dating her, which im not. so she automatically jumps down my throat about it. her mom is a raving drunk and she'll probably try and fuck up any future  relationship we might have.  todaaay...i did laundry in hopes of getting it all done (yeah right) then brit and i went to schnucks to buy some mini ravioli's. we ate and watched the ring before she had to leave for work at 5.   im really pissed about not getting to go to pointfest. the urge is going to be there! and im missing it! due to a wedding im attending. there's always warped tour, right?

      this being wednesday, the third day into summer break, im already beyond what to do with myself. i guess i should enjoy it while it lasts because it will get more exciting towards the end. once july rolls around, i probably will have too much on my plate. yesterday i was with morgan, brittany, sean, and heather all day, most of it was spent driving in morgan's van. we went to cd reunion to get an ani difranco cd and then we went out to eat mexican. for some odd reason, morgan doesnt have seats in the back of her van, so i was rolling around without my ass in a chair or a seatbelt. we went to drop sean off to change for work and we put the back seats in for fear that morgans crazy driving was going to make me lose my lunch. we drove 20 minutes all the way to shrewsbury to pick up heather and go see kill bill 2. we decided to go see it somewhere in the area so not to waste gas, which i might add is $1.90. we stopped at 2 theatres that weren't showing it. we were running low on gas so we stopped at a gas station to fill up, it cost $45.50. morgan went in to pay and came back out with 6 lottery tickets and 3 orange juices. she was bitching that it was $80 down a rat hole at the gas station. i made mention to her that it was impossible, even with the sea of orange juice bottles she bought, that it could total up to 80 bucks. she laughed and said nothing more. i layed down to sleep. when i woke up, morgan was wheeling around corners in a fury. they had over charged her. instead of charging her for 6 lottery tickets, 3 of each kind, they charged her for 33 of the same ones. as it turns out, the dumbshit at the gas station gave her 6 extra dollars. we must have spent 2 hours driving in that van. we went back to NoCo to see kill bill 2, it was amazing. today i passed up swimming at heathers due to a massive cold morgan gave me. it's time to guzzle some more cold medicine and head to bed.

      Let's get stupid drunk on the roof of an abandoned building at four thirty in the afternoon.We'll sit in lawnchairs and stare at the people, they all look like ants.I swear that i can see your house from here.And it goes without saying but it's always said that tomorrow we will wake up inside your bed with the bitter recollections of a romance killed and another tired night of being unfulfilled.But, isn't this what you wanted?Then why act so disapointed?I know that living in this city will do that to you.So, why do you have to always be so goddamn helpless?Isn't this what you wanted?Let's pack up our things and douse this building with the gasoline that we hid under the floorboards.We'll strike one match and make sure that this city never breathes again.And hopefully we'll be the first ones to go.And i wish it could be simple but it never will because the things that makes us stronger are the things that kill. And the sooner we can get ourselves out of this is the sooner we can learn from this experience.   urlLink download this song

      britney used to be my best friend until i decided to get sober. to this day, she swears our friendship was the reason she quit hardcore drugging. we both admitted the same day, and graduated the same day. we were junk-buddies but once we quit using smack we quit talking. britney wasn't the only person in our circle but she  was  the shoulder i could depend on when i bottomed out. since graduating from rehab and moving on with my life i haven't talked to any of the friends i used to hang out with. today at 3:30pm the phone rang and i wasn't near the caller i.d. so i picked up just in case. i knew the voice but couldn't place it. i looked at the caller i.d. and sure enough...underwood, robert. we talked for an hour. about everything. she dumped her boyfriend of 3 years and is now pregnant with her current boyfriends baby. it's a girl. she has also been clean since june 10th of last year, our graduation day. i told her about my dramatic break-up and my current girlfriend. i apologized for not keeping in touch. this is one of the most happiest days i've had in a long time. i'm so happy for her. so fucking happy.

      last night was a  total fucking mess . all i can say is i love your fucking guts and i would   never   let you go because of something like this.  &nbsp; the trip was fun, sort of. we finally got home at 3:30am on monday morning. i woke up at 9:00am to go to krispy kreme with my nieces. i played with mia, madison, and amber before passing out cold asleep. i slept until 4:30pm. brittany picked me up at 5:00pm. we went to my house so i could give her the stuff i bought her and then we drove to morgans to give her stuff. we hung out with morgan and heather and ate bar-b-que. my mom wanted me home by 9pm because she said i wasn't getting enough sleep. michelle and danielle came over and we decided to go see a movie. it was already 8pm but i was going to try to convince my mom it would be alright to go see a movie. then sam called...she asked brittany to go to her house and bring her dugout to her work so she could get high. brittany said she would so we got in morgans van and started to drive. i told brittany that i didn't really agree with it but it wasn't any of my business. morgan told brittany that she wouldn't allow marijuana in her vehicle so morgan drove brittany back to her car. we followed brittany to sams work and by that time it was 8:30pm and i had to be home. i called brittany on her cell and told her i was just going to go home and she could go do whatever she wanted to. morgan started to drive to my house. there was a water main break 1/2 a mile from my house. we didn't know how deep the water was and we didn't really care...we were all pissed off and on edge. morgan flattened one of her tires so we went to my house to ask my dad to change it. brittany called morgans cell and told her that she was stuck in the water and flattened two of her tires. when my dad changed morgans tire she drove me down to make sure brittany was ok. michelles dad was changing brittanys tires but she only had one spare. michelle went to get her car to see if her spare would fit brittanys car. it didn't. michelles dad told brittany that she needed 2 new tires and new brake pads. we decided to leave her car jacked up for the night and get it towed in the morning. we drove by the water mina break and there was a hole at least 5 feet wide and a foot deep.&nbsp;michelle danielle brittany and i went to my house where my mom was waiting up for me. sean called and said that he wanted to go to brittanys car and put on a spare so she could drive home. sean came over to my house to meet brittany and they left. my mom wanted to talk to me so i stayed up with her. she asked if brittany needed money and i told her that i didnt know. i did know, i just didnt feel like discussing anything else. i was tired and stressed. brittany and i argued the whole night about her friendship with sam and the whole pot situation. there's nothing i can say to her that she hasn't heard before. shes perfectly aware of the risks taken when she gets involved with pot, not smoking it, but being around it period. she thinks it wasnt such a big deal to have pot in her possesion because she was doing a favor for a friend. i hope she doesn't learn the hard way. &nbsp; today is tuesday. i feel like shit. my stomach is cramping and i want to eat. if i do i'll be face down in the bathroom. i miss brit. i'm happy to be home but i just want to spend time with her and no one else. we a have shit to discuss but all i want right now is to see her smile. all i want right now is to hold her and make sure she knows that we're going to work this out.

      shop: I had to go collect some last minute things before I go out of town. Extra t-shirts and such and my goalkeeper pants. I had to run to Walmart to buy a travel sized pillow because we aren't allowed to bring our own pillows due to limited space on the tour bus. I went to debbie's to pick up my RX's.  pack: Besides packing my usual street clothes I had to pack soccer equipment and cleats. If my luggage can hold out until the end of this trip, I promised it I'd let it go to luggage heaven. The zipper is about to bust. I have to pack my toiletries the day I leave so I can have my toothbrush and deo and what-not.  pray: ...that I don't forget/lose/break anything too valuable. Oh, and that I don't get too homesick from being away from my fucking amazing girlfriend for a week.  peace, love, and hardcore soccer-scrimmaging in minnesota for a week.

      i feel like shit...a total out-cast. it went something like this...  as usual i'm outside of the circle. the circle being my sister who is a year older than i, her friends and my mom. i decided to mess around on the computer and i opened windows media to listen to some ani. everyone got quiet and acted like i was planning some kind of homicide and then looked at me. my mom asked me what i was listening to and i told her. then she mumbled something under her breath and everyone laughed for at least five minutes and stared at me. then my boss, chris, called and told me he found a replacement to work for me while i was gone on my trip. my mom asked me who it was and i told her chris found a replacement. they all made fun of my job. assholes. it's funny because i am indeed younger than all of them but i would consider myself to have expierienced more ups and downs in life therefore giving me an itellectual edge. maybe i'm over-reacting, maybe i'm absolutely right, or maybe i haven't popped enough zoloft in the past few days.

      so I didn't sleep at all last night. I actually got out of bed at 4:30am when my dad woke up to get ready for work. I finished a laundry load of darks and collected some essentials for the trip. I'm leaving this coming saturday morning at 5am. I'm trying to get almost totally packed today because Julie is having a get-together at her house on wednesday and I can't pass up the chance to see "the girlfriend". A potential "first-timer" for Julie after admitting to herself that she could possibly be attracted to women. This should be fun. Brit and I had a tiff yesterday. I wasn't pissed at her, she wasn't pissed at me, we just get in these moods. She's under a lot of stress and I'm flipping out about the minnesota trip. Sometimes we just aren't in the mood to joke around. I see it as perfectly normal and she see's it as it's all her fault. It's no ones fault and I don't see it as a threat to our relationship. I love and care for her tons and vise versa. I'm going to miss her really bad, which i think is what is bugging me about leaving. Once I get on campus and settle in I think it'll be great fun. My line-up is 1)amusement park, 2)soccer, 3)lacrosse, 4)rugby. Definitely an active week, a little sun, meeting some new people, hanging out with some old friends.

      brit woke me up at 9am again. i always love seeing her but she thinks i'll get crabby when she wakes me up. but i never do. so i got up and i made eggs and toast for us. we watched ellen degeneres's "here and now". i think i watch it too much because i'm beginning to recite lines before she actually says them. after that was over we took a nap until 12pm. then we were hungry so i made some pasta with marinara sauce for us. i'm beginning to become quite the cook. brit left for work as my mom was walking in the door. i washed the ungodly amount of piled up dishes in the kitchen while my mom watched "the mothman prophecies". if i can convince my sister to go with me to the grocery store, i'm going to get some stuff to make tollhouse chocolate chunk cookies.
