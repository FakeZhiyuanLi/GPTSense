      It's been awhile since I posted an entry. It's been a busier than usual week. I saw Napolean Dynamite with the huz Tuesday night. It is the funniest movie I've ever seen. It is HILARIOUS! It's also informative. I learned what a liger is (part lion part tiger). We're going to see it again on Saturday (this will be the 4th time this week for the huz). We will definitely buy the DVD when it comes out.  I had lunch with a co-worker at P.F.Chang's today. I got the Almond and Cashew Chicken without the chicken. It was quite good. The waitress looked at me like I was a little strange when I placed my order but I didn't really care. I'm used to it.  I'm thinking about changing the cut and color of my hair. Ideas anyone?? The last time I tried to go darker my hair ended up green. I will definitely choose a better salon this time around.  I saw some good shark shows on the Discovery Channel this week. Scary stuff. There is a movie called "Open Water" coming out in August that is supposed to be very good. It's based on a true story about 2 divers who came to the surface only to realize that the boat had left them. Sharks, jellyfish and various other terrors appear. I wouldn't handle such a situation very well. Not well at all.  Well, I need to go put on the rice.  We're having Chinese take-out for dinner tonight.  It beats cooking!

      I have the day off tomorrow and I should be happy but I'm feeling kind of down. I'm sure it's my raging hormones. PMS is rough. It's been really rough this go-round because a girl I work with took a week off to vacate in the Cayman Islands and I had to do her job and mine. She just got back yesterday. It wasn't very fun at all. I'm also bothered by the Sandy Burgler debacle. This man should be arrested and put in prison for stealing those highly classified government documents. The fact that nothing has been done about it as of yet is very disturbing to me.     The husband and I are on a quest to cut back on the money we spend eating out. We're on our second week and we're doing really well. We eat out at lunch because neither of us has time to make lunch before we leave for work and we both need to get out of our workplaces for an hour or so in the middle of the day so we don't go insane. Dinner isn't a problem because we would much rather eat dinner at home than in a restaurant. I like cooking and I like knowing exactly what I am eating. I don't have a problem paying for Indian food, Chinese food or Mexican food because I can't make it taste like that. But I have a hard time paying $9 for pasta at a restaurant when I can make it at home for half of that amount. I love the smell of fresh garlic and onions sauteed in olive oil.     The experts say that the number one reason married couples fight and get divorced is money issues. Thankfully, the huz and I see eye to eye when it comes to finances. We're both savers. I've always been a saver. When I was a little kid I would put away various monies earned from doing chores in my hidden stash (it was in my closet if you're curious). When I eventually built up my stash to $100 I thought I was rich. I wish I would have known the husband back then and he could have taught me how to invest that $100. He's very smart and well-informed about money matters. I think he would be a great financial planner. Maybe someday.     I miss the family. I haven't seen everybody since that day at Guido's and Matt wasn't there so it wasn't an official "family gathering". I haven't seen him since, well, it's been so long I can't even remember. If you're reading this family, we need to get together soon. I wonder if the brother-in-law is still lifting the weights. I was impressed. I'm really enjoying the sister-in-law's blog. I'm still laughing about the vegetable cruelty website and the picture of the apple left to die alone on the grocery store floor. Priceless.    Well, I gotta go put some zit zap on the north star that has appeared on my chin.  Yet another reason why PMS is rough.

      I noticed the huz made a post on his blog about our opposing views on gun ownership. I believe it is a wise thing to have a gun in the house with all of the criminals running rampant in our society. To be unarmed is to be a potential victim. I read a harrowing story the other day about a married couple who was visited by the not-so-friendy-neighborhood-serial-killer (NSFNSK). The husband was stabbed, beaten and left for dead. The NSFNSK was on his way upstairs to rape and murder the wife (he had tied her up earlier) when he heard a noise coming from the basement. He went back down the stairs. It turns out that the husband had a shotgun. The NSFNSK won't be raping and murdering anyone else. Ever. Don't get me wrong - I am opposed to violence of any kind and would never, ever want to hurt, much less kill, another human being. BUT - and this is a very big BUT - I would rather shoot someone in the knee or a non-vital organ than be raped or killed myself. Let's face it. I'm hardly a match for a man of any size (except for maybe a small child) if he had evil on his mind. I never give such things a thought when Kel is home. But when he goes out of town I HATE it. I set the alarm on away (I have set it off so many times), I turn on a bunch of lights, and I lock the bedroom door. When we first moved here it was really bad. I usually ended up at my parents' house because I couldn't get any sleep. I've asked the husband if I could get a gun and he said no. He's afraid I'd shoot him. Not likely. I'm not an idiot - if I heard noises I would grab the gun and wait for the person to come into the bedroom. I would clearly check to see if it was the husband before shooting. And if it wasn't I would give the criminal a fair warning before pulling the trigger.  I'd say something like, "Hey - I have PMS and I have a gun and I will shoot you."  If the criminal had a brain he would high tail it and run.    By this point you might be wondering where my fears come from. Well, when I was 12 years old we were robbed. I was home alone.  I stayed home sick that day but I'm quite certain I really wasn't sick. Anyway, I heard two male voices downstairs and I was TERRIFIED. I hid under my bed and prayed that they wouldn't come upstairs. Thankfully they didn't. It was awful. That incident, coupled with way too many horror movies, has caused me to battle fears when I am home alone.    Now, onto Robert the tooth. Remember my "piece of plate in the fajita that cracked my tooth" incident? Well, I had the crown put in place about a month ago and thought everything would be dandy.  Well, there is an area that hurts like you wouldn't believe when I hit it with the toothbrush. I called the dentist today and he said to give it a little more time. He doesn't want to do a root canal unless it's absolutely necessary. I just wonder how he defines necessary. I just want to be able to brush my teeth without fear that I will hit that spot. I know the husband wishes I would stop talking about it. I figured I would talk about it here and spare him.    Our cat who resembles a baby harp seal appears to have gotten even bigger. I don't know what to do. I don't think he'd take kindly to a leash. He'll put forth a little effort when I get the stick with the feathers on it out but he tires easily. I stopped feeding him any canned food and he eats all natural, indoor-only cat food that is supposed to prevent obesity. Supposedly it contains something that boosts the metabolism and keeps cats from getting fat.  Hmmmm.  Anyway, maybe I should take him to the vet to see if he has a thyroid problem or something. I'm kind of embarrassed though because I think the vet will think I'm a horrible cat owner for letting him get so fat in the first place.  What a dilemma.    We're going to have veggie burgers and julienne fries for dinner.  Should be good.

      We are living in dangerous times. I'll tell you why this election is so important in a minute.  But first, consider the nine Justices on the Supreme Court:  William Rhenquist- Republican - nominated by Richard Nixon John Stevens - Republican - nominated by Gerald Ford Sandra Day O'Conner - Republican (with a very liberal voting record) - nominated by Reagan Anthony Kennedy - Republican (with a very liberal voting record) - nominated by Reagan Antonin Scalia - Republican - nominated by George H.W. Bush Clarence Thomas - Republican - nominated by George H.W. Bush David Souter - Republican - nominated by George H.W. Bush Ruth Bader Ginsberg - flaming liberal Democrat - nominated by Bill Clinton Stephen Breyer - Democrat - nominated by Bill Clinton  At first glance you would think we have an overwhelmingly conservative court but you would be wrong.  Just because they belong to the Republican party doesn't mean they hold conservative views or vote conservatively.  Oh no. Ginsberg is a radical liberal who needs to be impeached.  When the liberals can't win at the polls they go to the Supreme Court to futher their agenda.  Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia and William Rhenquist seem to be the only real conservatives on the court.  The fact that these justices aren't getting any younger means that there will likely be several holes during the next presidential term.  If Kerry is elected and is given the opportunity to nominate a justice or two (and they are approved) it could be disastrous.  Clinton took the cake with Ginsberg - they don't come much more radical than she is.    I find it quite telling that only 2 senators didn't vote either way for the Federal Marriage Amendment - yep, you guessed it - Kerry and Edwards.  I'm not surprised.  They didn't want to offend any potential voters.  It wasn't worth their time to take a firm stand on one side of the issue or another.  I honestly can't listen to either one of them so I don't.  Kerry is the most liberal senator and Edwards is #4.  Trust me on this....you do not want Kerry in the White House and it's not for the same reason that Hillary Clinton doesn't want him in the White House.  But that's a whole other blog entry.  This election is about so much more than the war in Iraq.  But sadly, many people can't see past that issue and will vote for Kerry in hopes that if he gets elected the troops can come back home.  I ask  you to please ponder this: if Kerry gets elected and is given the opportunity to put more liberal judges on the Supreme Court it could mean the end of life as we know it.  The ACLU won't stop until there is no mention of God anywhere, NAMBLA is a tax-funded organization and anyone is free to marry anyone or anything anytime they like.  That is not the kind of America I want to leave for my children and my grandchildren.  The only sane vote is a vote for Bush.

      Well, the husband made his best cake ever today. He made the second best cake ever last Thursday night. Anyway, I have little to no power to "just say no" to said cakes so I suppose I'll have to add an extra workout to my schedule for the next 2 weeks or so. We took several pieces over to my parents earlier today. I told Mom that they could freeze half of the pieces and she said, "Honey, these aren't going to make it to the freezer". Enough said.  My grandmother and favorite aunt were in town last week. They left yesterday. We had a good time. My mom made an incredible dinner Friday night and we all ate until we were about to pop. There's nothing like a homecooked meal they say. I agree. I have about 4 meals I cook "at home". We kind of rotate them so we don't get tired of any one meal. My aunt bought me a really cool vegetarian cookbook so I'll see what I can do with some of the recipes.  I'm kind of bummed. I opened the CVS ad this morning and was delighted to see that my favorite eyeshadow brand (Maybelline for those who care) was on sale - buy one get one free. Well, after the husband and I dropped off the cake and ate lunch at a groovy mexican restaurant we went to CVS. I eagerly made my way over to the makeup section only to realize that the buzzards (my definition for the people who get there before I do and buy all of the sale items) had already descended and swept up all of the good eyeshadow colors. BUMMER! I managed to find one trio and an eyeliner so I guess all is well. Besides, there is a CVS in Brentwood that I can visit tomorrow.  We saw Tom Cruise's movie "Collateral" yesterday. It was pretty good but I didn't think it was as good as the reviews indicated. Nothing can top "Napolean Dynamite". Ever. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD so I can buy it. The shark movie "Open Water" opens this weekend. One of my dreams is to cage dive with some great white sharks. How cool would that be????  Anyway, I think I'm going to take a nap now.  That's a nice thing to do on Sunday afternoons.
