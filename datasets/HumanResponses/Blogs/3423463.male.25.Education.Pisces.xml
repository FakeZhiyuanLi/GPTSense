      sure this will be the same as most firsts...  just sitting here fighting monkeys on a text adventure online. it's fun but pointless. working up the gumption to go study my phys chem right now. not obligatory or graded, so it's harder to get motivated, fascinating though it is.  i guess i'm not really writing this for anyone, just as a way to journalize my thoughts, i suppose. interesting it is: is there such a thing as a freudian typo? as in, when i go to write "journalize my thoughts" and come out with "journalize my thought," does that mean anything? is it true that the male brain can only focus on one thing at a time? something to explore. i've often thought how fascinating it would be to experience the female mind. would it be the same? similar? completely opposite? sane but twisted?  my wife is, in many ways, the same as i am: thoughts, feelings, passions...but in some areas we have separate viewpoints, different opinions. sometimes i don't understand at all what she is thinking, why she thinks that way. it requires much discussion to come to understanding. we're good at it, we try to understand as much as we can, but it takes time. i guess that's to be expected, and come to think of it, i haven't really known any men well enough to read their minds and understand their processes either.  does that make me different? foreign? is everyone this way, or does no one really understand anyone else?

      yeah, i just noticed that some people actually have semi-interesting things on here. don't worry, i won't pretend that anyone cares what i write or will ever see it. i'm just one of the freaks on the border between generations x and e: bitter and sarcastic, nothing interesting, nothing new. if you want to read what i write, you can go anywhere. no need to come here.  i read the other day that there's apparently a generation m now. i thought i was old when i found out i was technically both x and e, being born in 1979, the border year. so when was the border between e and m? and why do i keep getting older?  i will admit my life has more meaning than i probably let on on this stunted attempt at a journal. after all, the times i feel most like writing are the times i feel most irritated and bereft.  so feel secure, take hope, that i actually do have life. and it's a happy one. we have problems, yes. but so does everyone. and the good thing is that our problems aren't so bad. more importantly, we have each other to lean on. like that one song. some idiots sang that right before my high school graduation. no wonder they all died in that stupid earthquake.  anyway, now that my mood is back to normal i'm getting in the mood to go read for a while. preferably stephen king. in the middle of gerald's game right now. it's not exactly like his other work.  but still interesting.  alley just walked up. i was realizing that she'd been gone for an hour and was just about to start worrying. looks like i don't have to after all.

      i guess things are bugging me today.  yesterday the home teachers came over. they seemed rather cool, if not exactly dressed for the occasion. plus, we forgot they were coming...which reminds me where i'm supposed to be right now. that sucks. ..  .  ok, now i'm not going to write.  man. too bummed to write. what a crapper.

      can i take back what i said in third?  i don't even know that the whole voyage of discovery thing is what bugs me.  what really bugs me is that these stupid movies are degrading to men. seriously, how many movies have you come out of saying, "man, i could definitely make it the rest of my life without ever seeing my wife or any other woman again. men are all i need. i can live a fulfilling life without the opposite sex. who needs Them, anyway?"  and yet, ask the woman you go to see these movies with. ask her how she feels about you after leaving the theater. you know as well as i do that you really don't even need to ask. you can see it in her eyes. disdain. scorn. "i have had an epiphany. i could definitely make it the rest of my life without ever seeing my husband or any other man again. women are all i need. we can form sisterly bonds and throw off the shackles of our hated patriarchal society. men are better off castrated. i can live a fulfilling life without the opposite sex. who needs Them, anyway?" can you see it? can you not?  i'm not talking specifically about alley, either. she's great. she loves me, and i think that most of the time she likes having me around.  i love her. i like having her around as much as is possible. i also recognize the fact that my life would be meaningless and stupid without her.  if i want a good life, which i do, i need her. i need her almost more than i even need my stupid self.

      so yeah, you know what really bugs me about chick flicks? i hate to use the common term, but i think no other as aptly describes the stupid things. and there are also those chick books that men can never actually summon up enough patience to get through.  see, men want action. barring action, it's enough for us that a flick or a book has a good idea behind it. take ender's game. awesome idea. the battle room. that alone makes the book. the story, although compelling and good, is practically secondary. i mean, what would the story be without the battle room?  take spiderman. what is the point of this movie? it has none. why do so many men like it? because we want to be spiderman. i know some people disagree, but he's the best superhero of all time. why? because it could actually happen to me. yeah, yeah, it'll be in the future, and we don't have the technology, or even the building blocks of the theory, right now, but it's conceivable. and how cool would that be?  see? it makes me dream. it makes me ask the question, what if?  take any science fiction/fantasy book. why are they read almost exclusively by men? because they inspire, because they are dreams, because we ask what if, because we walk away saying, "this part was so cool..", "it would be really cool if..", etc. and you know, it doesn't even have to be in direct relation to the story. we can walk away from something and say, "geez, that gives me an idea. what if..?" see how that works?  on the other hand, the womany books out there are not about that. they aren't about dreams. they aren't about "what if?" they're about "exploring self" and "learning about relationships". men don't care about this. don't get me wrong, i'm not the stereotypical man, nor have i ever met one. but men take themselves as they are. there is no voyage of discovery or coming of age. these stories are cool simply for the reason that they are cool, not because we learn about life.  back to the future is cool because doc brown built a time machine out of a delorean, not because marty learns that "your future is whatever you make it. so make it a good one."  am i wrong? have i completely missed the point? or am i just perpetually annoyed?

      the title fits my day. work was long and pointless, followed by a meeting that really had nothing to do with me other than reassure me as to the strength and optimistic future of the company, then i came home.  we were planning on getting a lot of things done today, especially considering that we have to have done, by tomorrow:  • the emissions on the car • the inspection on the car • the registration on the car • the title change on the car • alleys drivers license • the insurance on the car  which required us to have done before:  • alleys social security card name change • cashing the check from her dad so that we would have enough cash to do all the crap • in order to cash the check, add alleys name to my bank account, because the other account we share is -$50 and we can't afford to pay it up right now  so, we got done the prerequisites, but the rest was a blow. yeah, pretty much, we got nothing done, just the stuff we didn't have to have done today, just the stuff we had to have done before the stuff we have to have done today.  so wish us luck on not getting another ticket we can't afford and/or the car impounded or whatever the heck it is they do to people whose stickers have expired.  it's not even really that we didn't get anything done. i mean, how important is it really, and how likely are we to get pulled over/arrested/imprisoned tomorrow? probably not very. i hope. it's just that i took three hours off today and nothing really came of it. i get off at two, go home, end up convincing alley we have time to uh, sit around, ;), until three, then we go to the social security office, don't get out of there 'til four, go to the bank, by the time we're done with that it's almost five AND i get lost on the way to the stupid inspection place. i mean, i've lived here twenty-five years, you would think i could manage to get to the dumb garage in less than forty minutes.  i just feel really worthless and irritated right now.  i mean, maybe everything would have worked out if i'd left ten minutes earlier. if we hadn't.. you know.. when i got home. if i wouldn't have thought we could do the social security thing quickly. if i would have known my way around. if the emissions place we went to first had actually been allowed to do emissions sometime in the next sixty days. if that other stupid place hadn't been closing in exactly five minutes, "so you better get down here quick" in freaking rush hour five o'clock traffic like a loser. if that jerk hadn't been coming up behind me and i could've backed up while i was in the left turn lane to get into the stupid parking lot with thirty seconds to spare. if there hadn't been an endless stream of freaking cars coming off the stupid freeway.  !  anyway, i'm quite irritated.  and i'm glad alley went to get the groceries herself. not that i mind going, but she wanted to go herself, probably not the least reason for which is my stupid irritated mood right now. i just hope she doesn't die or something on the way.  that's really the worst part of her driving now.  it sucks.

      yeah, i guess i haven't really written down any thoughts on this matter yet.   about two weeks ago alley found out for sure that she was pregnant. it was exciting. she feels bad that she didn't think of some creative way to tell me about it, but i'm actually kind of glad she just called me at work and said, guess what? i kind of doubt my ability to decode a bizarre attempt to tell me about it.  anyway, we walked over to the mall over the weekend and looked at baby clothes and stuff. it was dang cool. alley was getting all excited and stuff. i was, too. she thought the clothes were cute and everything. i was mainly thinking about the little girl that was planning on going inside them and getting excited about that. i have these images of holding her and stuff. it's real cool. i don't really think i'm ready to do the fatherhood thing, but i think i'm about as ready as i'll be at any time in the future without kids. if that makes sense.  life is just being really good to us right now. alley is feeling better than she has, the money situation just keeps getting better, i got speakers at work, alley got a haircut...i mean, what's really not good? nothing.  the haircut looks really good, by the way. i don't know if it's that or something else, but i'm feeling more attracted to her since she got it last night than is usual. i was watching her get ready for bed last night and something about her body was just incredibly beautiful. practically irresistable, actually. now she's coming to get me for lunch, and i'm making plans.  oh, and the new job at legacy foundation is working out pretty well, too. i got paid yesterday, and it was more than i had expected, and i found out i'll get the raise for this next pay period, so i'm feeling pretty good. work at investools is still good. working on learning the product so that we can have that as a tool in providing for our future and that of our family.  leaving for idaho, the jumping-off point for washington, tomorrow. we're both psyched. it's going to be dang cool. the drive will be long, but nice. the stay will also be fun. we're planning on camping and stuff for some of the nights, so that'll be really cool. i think we're going to the rain forest and to some beach to sleep, so yeah. plus, there's all this other stuff. maybe we'll find a shaved noodle shop in the international district. wouldn't that be nice?

      i've decided to keep a log of the different odors i encounter on the way to and from work every day. they're interesting, if disgusting. keep in mind that these aren't faint odors i have to look for, they're right-up-in-your-nose stenches that permeate the air for miles. impossible to miss.  &nbsp;  july 13: skunk. and skunk poo.  july 14: the accumulated biological waste of ten thousand people  july 15: all of china is here, it's july, and they haven't showered in weeks.  july 16: decaying vegetable matter  july 17: rotting, unevacuated&nbsp;intestines july 21: rotting cabbage and chicken manure

      where i somehow convinced the bishop to set aside $1200 of the ward budget for senior couple missionaries every month. when he agreed, i guess i got up in sacrament meeting or something, but it was more like the marriott center than a chapel, and bore my testimony of missionary work and how important it was. i made sure everyone realized that $1200 meant that there were like three and a half people in the ward that could leave on a mission right then, with no funds, everything was already taken care of. the bishop was nodding and stuff. also, people were laughing at various points through the testimony, which isn't normal, but i guess i was making jokes or something, because i kept raising my hands as if to quiet the laughter and saying things like, "i know it's strange, but isn't that how it always is?" and, "i know, i know, live the gospel and be happy...who would've thought?"  i have a vague notion that mike was there, but i'm not really sure now.

      journeys consume our flesh rapidly we sit on the table drinking the wine of oblivion and creatures rip our eyes and flesh of our buttocks  with red eyes and green teeth they come in hordes and jump on our faces  we don't notice their screaming as we sip the wastes without recycling anything of our souls mouldering corrupting dying in the sand  we lie there now watching the waves wash the shore and transmit their strength to the sand  missing the power of the water we yearn for the homely starts and wish we could return to that place we left behind in the previous  maybe if we weren't oblivious maybe if we saw what we do and thought about the creatures jumping around stormily and wreaking havoc with mind and body always craving more and more of our lives and antiquities  hailing from nowhere we came and now inhabit the waste and the lush of the earth which supports us and gives us a place to stand while we wade through the drama of our lives  demons destroying us come from deep within or maybe not so deep perhaps they come from somewhere more topical perhaps the addition of body  and yet it seems that these demons spring not from flesh but from somewhere further somewhere more fundamental than dust more basic than element  and yet where is that and why and did i make my own so long ago and why did i shortsightedly allow room for so many demons did i not recognize them as such or did i welcome them subversively and in rebellion trying to sabotage myself  but sabotage is a demon where did he come from where did i make choices before i knew right from wrong  and why why oh why did i ever choose not right?

      yeah, my wife knew i was in a crappy mood yesterday. as did i. i guess we both have our ways of dealing with it. i wrote to try to relieve the stress, she went and got me a lucky bamboo to make me feel better. it was really sweet. and yes, i feel strange using the word "sweet" to describe anyone, even my wife. that's ok though, no one will ever read this.  anyway, the cats destroyed the bamboo before i could get it to my desk this morning. i don't know whether it's going to live now. two of the stalks are turning yellow, i think. i can't remember whether they were yellow before or not. the third one seems to be doing all right. it didn't get hammered, though. thing is, i didn't know lennon could get up on the bookcase i had these on, what with his broken legs and everything. apparently he can.  saw pieces of april last night. it was good. about what i expected, which is saying a lot considering i had high hopes for it. one of the few movies from the last little while that wasn't disappointing. stepford wives was good, too. other than that, i'm kind of just a little nostalgic for the good ole days of star trek and other movies that i can't remember but seem always to eclipse the ones i see now. maybe i should keep a list of movies i actually like. i wonder how many would be on it.

      yeah, i just found a theme for my desktop about 1984. i think the idea of a 1984 theme is cool, but i'm not particularly happy with this one. in fact, i'm not really happy with any desktop themes. there are the boring ones that come with the os and everything, but other than that, it's pretty lame.  anyway, i guess i can finally reveal how incredibly boring this place is for the second half of the week. first half, busy. second half, stagnant. which means i just sit around here and do nothing for eight hours.  although today i went to randmcnally.com and planned out our route for our washington trip. coming up pretty fast it is, and i'm excited. so is alley. i'm thinking we'll probably be able to attend at least four new temples on the road there. it'll be fun. alley's doint the planning for what we actually do in seattle, which is fine with me. it's looking like it's going to be a blast, though. we get to drive for hours and hours and see all this good and beautiful stuff. we decided to rent a car to drive up there so that we wouldn't be running the risk of breaking down in the taurus.  speaking of which, we've finally got all the safetyemissionsregistrationtitlechangedriverslicenseinsuranceetccrap done today. what a relief that was. alley's been really great in doing all this stuff. it's been really hard to try to get things done while i'm at work from 8 to 5. and then when i take some time off i end up not getting anything done anyway.  but it's all good now.

      as life drifts slowly past i grasp the edges of driftwood and try to stay afloat and hold my loves and cares  yet it seems that often i lose my grip sometimes on float sometimes on sink  she is still float though but it seems sinking sometimes as i struggle to do something to help her and free her from pain  but there isn't anything to do and the things i can do feel so useless

      shuddering in my seat with real or imagined pains in my bowels or rather in the bones of my hip  dull aches without pain just emptiness there, and i don't know what it is  but i know that it started when i gave my pitying to him and knew that he works hard to be successful  yet i feel that he is like me and not like them that he could do something well but this?  if he puts his mind to it, perhaps but thus far he lacks stellar performance  he studies and worries and how does his family get by?  his courage is greater than mine he will take chances to gain more while i sit in mediocrity doing unimportant tasks, but having a steady wage  and i admire him with pity and worry for his welfare and self-image

      see, the thing is, i couldn't even quite catch what they were talking about for a minute. the clarity came when i realized that they all thought of teachers as free babysitters for their kids that they want to be out of their hair, at least during the day, and they don't want to pay for it.  is it just because i'm a teacher that this offends me?
