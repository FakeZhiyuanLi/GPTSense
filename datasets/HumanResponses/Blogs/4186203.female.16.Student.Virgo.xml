       Why is it that we think stars are shaped the way they are because I don't ever remember seeing stars up close, and like aint they meant to be just like suns..which aint rly shaped like a star, lol..      I was watchin six feet under today and they were doing a funeral and i thought if that was me and i died next week, who would stand up at my funeral? who would stand up and speak about how nice a person i was, to say oh ye i remember when this happened..because it seems like its only me who cares about the past or memories that have happened, its like its only me..    Its like I wanna do something with someone, meet up, talk, but no because they don't wanna it doesnt happen, i wanna go somewhere but they can't be bothered, but when they want to do something i jump at the chance, just because I know i will be pleasing them, what has it come down to ? Pretending to be someone else just to make other people happy.. Pretend that everythings okay now and that I ain't hurting anymore, thats what it is, because now im realising how people hate it when i talk, how they hate it how i get pissed off about something and i copy n paste the convo n mail it, or i tell them about something im feeling or saw that i thought was interesting, but they don't care anymore, because its got nothing to do with them, its just me rambling..thats all it is to them.. oh thank goodness i can block her or say im going offline, because i say no to meeting up so i got the chance to leave when im bored and fed up of pretending im interested.. thing is i kno that people hate listenin, so why do i carry on ?      Why is it that Im trying to be someone im not ? Trying to become a better person ? Trying to hide what everyone hates so much

       I don't know what I want anymore. Like one minute I say to myself back away because theres no point leading him along because you know nothing will come of it, but on the other hand, sometimes I do think I've got feelings for him, feelings that have appeared from speaking to him on the net every night for the past month or so, feelings that have never really gone away from months ago..But what do I do ?     I want to see him and Ive suggested it but even that has turned into a big issue now so Im guessing we won't..maybe tommorrow I won't come on the net, I think Im just goin to block them all for a while, theres onl James who I speak to anyway..  Dean goes on holiday tomorrow, he text me and said about speaking when he gets back, like everything that was said last night didnt happen, sometimes I just wish he could be honest..  Saw Jaimes today, read his journal, he had put about when he met everybdoy and what he thought about them for Abbi he put: Abbi (the girl dean is going to dump his girlfriend for) Pretty much sums it up though, but when I read that, it didnt make me feel anything, I didnt feel upset in the slightest, I do think I'm over him now, after everything that happened, it only took me two and a half months, lol  # But The Words Inside My Head, Are Better Left Unsaid (Nine Days - Crazy) #

       Its weird, why is it that you think you know people, and really you don't..     I'm going to start over, theres four weeks left of holiday then back to school, new start, new people, new everything     Its like the last year was a big waste, like it only happened to show me that I'm a shite person and that I aint worthy of having anyone there to care for me and from now on, I don't want it to be about me relying on other people, I want it to be about me and doing what I want to do and being happy for what I am..not just who I am when I'm trying to make others happy..     All I ever do is pick out the bad points in everyone else, I never stop to think what other people think about me, then when I do find out, its like a big punch in the face, like how could my friends think of me like that, but what kind of person am I if it leads them to be thinking of it in the first place..     When did I start caring so much about myself and not about other people?
