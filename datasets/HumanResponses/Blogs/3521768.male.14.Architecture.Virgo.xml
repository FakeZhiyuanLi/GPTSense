         La Gioconda, or, the Mona Lisa. Painted by Leonardo DaVinci of the young wife of a merchant. Its painted on a thin sliver of wood, and, is admired by most all people to be considered an extraordinary painting. Her smile is unconsistent with paintings of the period, which makes it stand out. The way the folded hands make a triangle with the body is stunning.   The history of the Mona Lisa is interesting. DaVinci was asked to paint the wife of a merchant, and, it took him over four years to complete it, but, never gave it to the merchant. He took it with him to France, where it traveled from King Francis I. to the Louvre to Napoleon, then back to the Louvre. It was stolen, brought to Italy, sold, and then returned to the Louvre again. In 1956, they attempted an acid procedure on it, which damaged much of the lower half of the painting, but, was saved by many years of restoration. It now sits in the Louvre, unable to leave again.

      Welcome to Noodle Soup. I started a blog, not to long ago, called  urlLink Alphabet Soup . It is a group story writing blog. Well, this is it's newly founded sister blog, Noodle Soup.  The main purpose of this blog? Essay writing. Alot like www.everything2.com . But our goal is improving our writing ablity, whereas their goal is sharing knowledge, and writing really neat stuff. So, obviously you're not going to be reading this blog for good writers.  So, the name.. yeah, I had trouble with that one. My description of it? Alphabet soup, the blog for fictional stories, is a letter soup. You can arrange the letters however you want. The sister blog, which deals with essays, is non-fictional stuff, just a presentation of information. Noodles can be bent and stuff, and presented differently, but they are still the same noodle, the same info.  Wether or not people actually pick up on that, well, that's their problem. If someone has a better title, please tell me.

      Devon used to be a fairly athletic guy, always running around, doing sports. He wasn't the best, but, he definitely wasn't the worst. But in time, he matured and became somewhat of a nerd. He was always on his computer, his brother gave it to him once he moved out and got a better one, so it wasn't a great computer. His friends, few friends, described it as 'ancient.' His life wasn't all that boring until one day...so he thought.  Devon was at his little computer, typing away for a research project for his college history class. He was writing a 10 page essay over the Revolutionary War. It was due tomorrow  and he was only on the 7th page. To make matters worse, he was really stressing out and when he looked at the clock it read: 2:16 AM.  "Crap, why did I wait so long to do this! Prof. Neits assigned it a week ago, and I blew it off until three days before." He sighed. He finished the sentence he was typing and leaned back in his comfy chair, his only escape from the major pressure, with his arms behind his head. The screen flashed black then a greenish blue screen popped up.   "Oh my God! What happened to my report!!" he screamed as he slapped the computer hoping it might help.  It flashed white then blue again and typed out the message:  "m-th-r k-dn-pp-d. -ddr-ss = time, r-ck p-th."  "What is that supposed to mean? It's in some sort of code, or something...Wait a minute, there aren't any vowels! Except in time. I wonder why.." Devon questioned. "Hmm...maybe the dashes took place of certain vowels?? M-_-T-H-_-R..Hmmm, M-A, nah. M-E? nope...M-I!...no..M-O! M-O-T-H-E-R...Mother?! What about her!!" He screamed, as if it were a living person.  Devon spent hours, it seemed, trying to crack the rest of the message. So far he had Mother kidnapped. Address = time rock path. He still was unsure what the time was for. Eventually, the remembered it was 2:16 when this message came up.  "216 Rock Path? That's not an address anywhere near here." wondered Devon. "What addresses do I know of that have a 216 in their address.."  After about 10 minutes of thinking, he finally had it.  "216 Rock Path stands for 216 Stoney Road! It's only a few blocks from here!" he shouted "But why would my mom be at the library? Oh well, I better go look for her."  For some unknown reason, he got up, tossed his bag over his shoulder, and headed out the door.  "What the-!" exclaimed Devon as he peered around outside. It was daylight. "How is this possible?! My computer said 2:16!"  He decided it didn't matter seeing as he had to get to his mother's aid. Then, he realized that his mom was here, in New York. When she lived in Kansas.  "Wait a minute. How can she be here?" asked Devon, as if there was some all-knowing guru right next to him. "No time though, I must get to her."  He trekked on and eventually reached the library. It seemed to be standing unusually taller than normal but he ignored it.  "216 Stoney Road. This is it" he said. As he walked into the library.   There was a spiral staircase. He walked up to it, looked upwards, only to see it going up very high. Too high He saw the ceiling and figured his mother might be there seeing as she wasn't on the first floor. He started hiking up the staircase getting nearer to the ceiling, and to his mom. He was looking up the whole time but, when he looked down, he appeared to be on the third step still. This threw his equilibruim off and he stumbled. But, the ceiling wasn't any further away than when it was a second ago. He got up and started up the stairs once again. After hours, it seemed, he finally go to the top. He peered over the edge of the floor and saw his mother tied to a chair at the end of a hallway of bookcases. He hurried up the rest of the way and dashed to his mother. As he neared her, her heard her screaming something.  "G-- -p!!! W-k- u- D---n!!" she screamed.  Slowly, the message became clear. She was screaming 'Get up! Wake up Devon!' Devon, realizing he was in a dream, he suddenly awoke to find himself in his room. But, it wasn't his room as it had been in the dream. Not his sheetless bed, cluttered desk and shelves. But, it was his twin bed, with dinosaur sheets and pillow, his rug with a street and town imprinted on it. The rug had toys scattered everywhere on it.  "Devon! Get up! It's time for school!!"

      "LANCE! WAKE UP! NOW!!" A large man with a deep voice was banging on the door to Lance's bedroom.  It was six o'clock in the morning, and Lance rolled over with a sigh.  He opened his eyes to look at his clock.  "Ugh, I hate this... especially on a Monday..." he shut his eyes and went back to sleep.    Twenty minutes later Lance's father came into the room, dressed for work in a black business suit and a tie.  "Lance," he started "It looks like I'll have to get you out of bed again." he walked over to the side of the bed and pulled back Lance's warm covers.  Lance's legs shot up to his chest the moment the cold morning air touched him; he shivered a little.  His dad then lifted the matress off on one side, sending Lance rolling over onto the floor with a thud.  "DAD! I told you not to do that anymore!" he said, shooting up.  His dad replied with a small devlish smile on his face, "maybe next time I should pour cold water on your head instead?"  Lance shouted back "NO!  Come on dad, I'm never late for school." "Only because I get you up." his dad replied.  Two minutes later they left the house, Lance was chewing on a cereal bar and trying to flatten his messy brown hair which he had no time to comb.  "Got everything?" his dad asked.  "Yeah, everything except a good night's sleep." Lance said with a small yawn.  He saw his dad get into his car and drive off to work.  Lance lived in a small community just outside of the city, so his house just across the street from school.    In Twenty minutes the first period bell rang.  Lance was practially falling asleep, he stayed up too late doing homework, only because he chatted over AIM too long.  His dad didn't get home until very late, so it's not like his dad would really care on the way home from work.  First period was Geometry, and he wondered why this class had to be first period of the day.  "Class." a blonde haired teacher addresed the class, "pull out your homework.  Problems 1-65 please." Lance's heart sank... he didn't do his homework!  "Oh, what am I going to tell hi-" he stopped mid-thought, walking across the room, her blonde hair flowing in the air behind her, was Alexa. She walked past the window which overlooked the flowers in front of the school, her glowing blue eyes flashed in Lance's direction, and for a moment, both eyes met, and the-  "Looking at the beauty of God's work, Lance?" the teacher asked. "Uh, y-y-yes, sir.  I mean, no sir, I mean-" Lance replied, wondered if the teacher saw him looking at Alexa. The teacher replied sarcastically "I know how beautiful the flowers in the garden are, but please try and pay attention.  Now, you're homework?"  The last bell rang, and Lance picked up his bag and headed for his locker. Behind him walked Alexa and some of her friends.  He wondered if he'd ever get to make a move, she was always hanging around with her friends, and it's not like he could just pull up in some nice expensive car and drive away alone with her, impressing both Alexa and her friends.  He headed outside, going home, but stopped at a tree to think.  After banging his head against the tree several times, he saw Alexa come out for tennis practice.  Several rounds went by, when all of a sudden a voice popped up from behind Lance.  "Painful, isn't it.  You're whole world standing just beyond that fence, just out of reach."  Lance seemed not to notice too much "it's only a fence..." he replied back.  The guy behind him answered that, "a very big fence, can't have stray tennis balls flying out... or flying in for that matter."  "No.. we wouldn't want tha-  HEY!" Lance jumped back.  Standing behind him was a shrimpy kid with red hair and brown eyes, he was obviously a freshman.  "What are you sneaking up on people for?"  After several minutes of talking, Lance really only found out the guys name was Mike, and he skipped all of middle school because of his intelligence, but knew how he could help Lance get Alexa.  "Um, but if you skipped all of middle school... wouldn't that mean, you know... you're a nerd?  And uh, incapeable of getting a date?"  Mike looked stunned, "well, if you don't want my help, you're doing a greeeeaaat job already with getting your date.  So I'll be out of your way."  as Mike walked away, Lance realized how good off he WASN'T in getting Alexa.    The next day after school, Lance was in his position.  Mike had reset the electronic message board in front of the school to read "ALEXA, I LOVE YOU", and then Mike would set off some fireworks or something.  Lance could care less about fireworks, he just wanted the message to be seen.  Alexa would soon come out from tennis practice, but one of the last ones to leave so all of her friends wouldn't be there.  He waited, and waited, and waited.  Until at last, after what seemed like an hour (but was really only five minutes) Lance got up the courage to go find her himself.  He walked around the corner, only to see Alexa making out with some other guy!  How could this happen?!   Lance quickly tured around and headed home.  Moments later he heard the fireworks go off, so he suspected that Mike sent them off, and also wondered if he turned on the sign.  If Mike DID turn on the sign, it was probably in the other guy's favor.  He gave a big sigh as he fell backwards onto his bead.  "Oh well, life moves on I guess." he said to himself.  "but I really did like her..."

      "Dimitri! Wake up!" yelled Drew, one of Dimitri's crew buddies.  "Huh? Aaaaaah!" screamed Dimitri, still thinking he was falling toward the deep turquoise waters of the ocean.   "Whoah buddy, calm down, you are safe inside the ship on a nice cot now, don't worry" reassured Winters.   "Ouch! Ughh...what h-happened? Where am i-I?" mumbled Dimitri as he flinched the moment he felt a shock of pain run through his battered leg.  "You were hanging on the anchor after being hit by that cannon ball. You fainted, but, you still hung on. You saved my life." said Winters. Dimitri noticed the faintest trace of sympathy within his gaze. "Thank you. And, thank God we managed to get you up. Drew here had to go down there with a rope around his waist. He carried you up to safety!"   "Heh, th-thanks Drew. But, d-did we win the battle?" said Dimitri, shivering from loss of blood.  "Yes we did. It was a close one though. They got us pretty badly. I have some of the crew working on those dents below deck. It's a good thing we built her sturdy!" chuckled Winters.  As Dimitri looked around the room from the soft cot they had lain him on, he saw Drew, Winters and a few other crew mates he sometimes talked to including Jake, Gavin, and Hector. He started to smile, knowing that all these people were here because they cared for him, just as everything started spinning and became fuzzy, he blacked out yet again.  His peaceful sleep was broken by another dream. It started just as the other one ended.   It was a trap...

         Dimitri hung from the anchor hole as best he could, the shock still held him in its numbing grip. He could see Cptn. Winters yelling, but the noise was shier void, as if audio has seized. Dimitri held fast for a time into the battle, but has only the strength of a man, and finally his grip faltered, and he plunged into the turquoise water.      The following few minutes were a total blur of blue and white foam, but by a godsend chance, he ended up on a plank, 100 or more yards out, it was all he could do to hold to the board as he drifted farther, and again, passed into darkness...     Again awaken, this time, to the lumbering shadow of a Royal Battle Ship. Then he noticed a life raft headed in his direction, with fully armored gaurdsmen ready to escourt him to the abyss. He made a feble attempt to flee, but it was only an aimless paddle outward, and he soon stood before the Admiral of the Royal Navy Fleet.     It was a trap...

      His happy thought was soon interrupted by a loud *CRACK*. Across the room, there was a large, splintered dent in the hull of the ship. He jumped, dropping Wesley to the floor. Wesley hurriedly scurried off to his same little cove in the flour, but, Dimitri had nowhere to go.  "We are surrounded!" said a crew member, shortly followed my another loud crack directly behind Dimitri. He was thrown forward by the sheer force of the blow to the hull. Dimitri decided to run up on deck to see what the heck was happening.  When he saw Winters standing there, calm and fierce, at the same time, he too was clam for a second. A very short second. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a huge steel ball flying through the air straight for the captain's back.  "CAPTAIN! WATCH OUT!" scream Dimitri as he dove to protect the captain. The ball thankfully misses Winters, but, Dimitri wasn't so lucky. The cannon ball had bashed his right leg from the knee down to no return. It's force carried Dimitri, away from the captain toward the edge of the deck. He fell down the side of the ship. The captain was sure, he would never see that young, intellegent Dimitri again.  He slowly walked to the edge of the ship to see the fate of his young hero. Everything around him seemed to go in slow motion as he peered over the edge to see young Dimitri hanging from the anchor hole.

      He walked carefully accross the slightly flour covered floor, taking special care of where he placed each foot. Upon reaching the wall he slid down onto the floor, his knees bent into his stomach. He surveyed the floor around him, looking for something. His face lit up at the sight of his partner. A large fat, grey haired rat, was laying, almost squished, between two bags of flour. Dimitri greeted his furry companion, and gave him a little scratch on the nose. "Hello there, Wesley." The rat instantly began grinding it's teeth, making the clicking noise all rats make when overjoyed.  Dimitri reached into his vest pocket, and pulled out a shimmering gold coin. The rat's eyes burst with joy at the sight of it. It began scraping away at the floor with it's paws, slowly, but surely pulling itself out of it's little cave. (How it got in there in the first place, is another mystery of the universe.) Then, like a bullet out of a rifle, Wesley the Rat came rocketing out of his hole. His head slammed into Dimitri's outstreched hand, and bounced back. Taking a second to regain his thoughts, he than grabbed the coin in his paws, gave it a snif, and than a bite. He looked up once more at Dimitri's face, to show his gratification, and scampered off, down a hole in the floor.   Wesley returned from his home in the floor, skipping greetings and immediatley searching Dimitri's hands for another shiny prize. Dimitri handed about 20 coins to the large greedy rat, untill he came back to an empty hand. Dimitri patted him on the head, and scratched him behind the ears, and said, "Don't worry Wes, I'll bring you more another day."  Dimitri had been practicing this ritual for quite awhile now. He's probably stored atleast 300 coins down there. Dimitri smiled to himself. He picked up Wesley and cradled him in his arms, tickling his white belly.   From above, a loud commotion broke out. Dimitri sat nervously, petting the rat to sooth his fear. He'd been through this many times, but it always worried him. The panic in his mind has calmed down a little since his first time in an attack, but never completely. To erase the fear completely would be to erase the human in him, it is impossible. The yelling got louder, Dimitri became more uneasy. He imagined the fight taking place above him. He saw the enemy ship, 4 times as large as his own. He saw a cannonball lodge itself in the side of the ship, and the entire room filling with water. He then saw Captian Winters, fighting to his very last breath, and suddenly, remarkably, most of his worry was soothed. He pictured him and Winters, fighting together, side by side. He smiled to himself again, and waited.

      After seeing the captain's steady gaze, he calmly went back to his room to read. He was reading a very good book. It was an action scene, much like the one he was experiencing at this very moment. The only variation was that it wasn't between two pirate vessels. It was between two small countries a ways south and east of where they were. It was a fiction book so, it never  really  happened. But, it was really interesting. So interesting, he didn't even notice the captain standing in the doorway, giving him that same, comforting, yet forceful green stare.  "We are approaching the enemy ship." explained Winters. "We are just out of firing range so I need you to take cover below deck, on the starboard side."  "Yes sir." said Dimitri as he snapped his book shut and stood up straight.  The captain then turned on his heel, and walked, almost marching, down below deck with Dimitri following. Once below the upper deck, Dimitri once again saw this familiar place. Barrels of ale, bags of curry and flower. There was a different arrangement in the corner with some flower bags. One could tell that Dimitri has been here before and these small battles are no new thing. Little did he know, this was not any ordinary 'small battle.'

      It still amazed Dimitri how organized the crew was. Drunken fools only hours before, they now worked with an ease and grace like no other. Another mystery of the universe, thought Dimitri. Perhaps though, it wasn't all that much of a mystery at all. Dimitri glanced at the captian, and they caught eachothers eyes, and for a split second, Dimitri knew exactly why the Pirates worked so well. The sharp green eyes smiled at Dimitri, and seemed to tell him, "Everything will be alright."

         "Sir! You must awaken! The pirateship Sailbeam has been spotted only half a mile out!" Fumbiling about for his trousers and coat, the news is delivered quickly. "The Captain requests your prescence on the bridge, sir!" Out of the cabin, it was utter pandamonium, men hurried for their cloths and ran to their battle stations, some half nude.    Once on the bridge, he realized that only half the officers were in uniform. "How long till were in range?" asked Captain Winters. "Twenty minuets, if the winds hold", said the navigator  "What are we up against?", the Captain asked  "Armorment unknown," said the weapons specalist," but our range isn't enough to strike first" Dimitri sighed, this was the kind of thing right out of the text book, but he still worried. Would this day end for him at the bottom of the sea?

      In the warm lamplight Dimitri fumbled dizzily around the swaying, creaking, snoring room. Dimly lit all around him were the faces and beards of stinky old men, half asleep, half unconcious. The smell of ale wafted steadily in front of Dimitri's nose, poisoning his every breath. He carefully made his way through a maze of bodies, trying hard not to step on anyone, and then halted in the corner, shining his lamp on a large chest nested next to the wall, bolted to the floor. He exhales, sending dust in swirling patterns in front of his eyes. His attention is temporarily lost in the swirling patterns of light rays through dust. Quickly he snaps back into reality, and reaches into his pocket. His hand emerges from the pocket of his sleeveless white vest, revealing a rather large, rusty key. Hey presses the key into it's rightful hole on the chest, and turns it. Quickly but carefully he opens the large metal framed lid of the chest, and the light from his lamp is reflected back at him, from thousands of golden coins. Hastily, he shuffles a couple handfuls of coins into a small bag, closes the lid, locks the chest, and creeps back through the maze of smelly old men. He climbs up a ladder, breathes a sigh of releif, and retreats to his cabin.   The creaking of the ship continues steadily as Dimitri lay on his back, staring up at the ceiling of his private room. He closes his eyes and has a short moment of peace. Sadly to be soon interupted by tomorrow's duties.

      Hi, my name is Travis and my other blog is  urlLink here.   I hope that this group story blog will turn out well and I will do my best to contribute. I am not much of a writer. But, I think it will be fun to practice writing, especially for school. I want to develop my writing skills, not because I want to be a writer, but, because they need developing. :)  -Travis-

      And with his mighty hand, Buddy created A bowl, and in this bowl, letters and tomato soup. Then with a grace like no other, Buddy called forth the soup crafters, who formed the letters into sentences, and then into paragraphs, and finally into stories.   This will hopefully be a fun group blog in which those who wish to join, and have decent writing ability, can come together to create collaborated stories. Eh, I give it a couple weeks before we give up on it.  So, we'll start a new story every month, and maybe take a break for short one member stories, weekly stories, and any other new interesting things we can think of.  I'll begin by inviting some friends to come join in on the fun. Then we'll attempt to start some sort of story out of our little brains.

      Well, Yesterday, I was painting a house for Buddy's mom.  We drove over there and on the way there, I read a bit of  To Kill a Mockingbird . But, when we got to the house we were going to paint, it was really hot and humid. I eventually rolled up my sleeves as we sanded rough edges and put primer on. Then, Buddy and I went to one side of the house and started painting and his brothers #1 and #2 were painting and stuff on the other side. We painted alot more than they did. Brother #2, I think, kept walking over and watching us. We painted for about 3 hours and got paid around 20 bucks. My first summer job assignment type thing. I actually plan of either working for my uncle in construction or, if I can't do that, i have a spot coaching summer gym where I used to take gymnastics. I miss it alot but, I'm afraid to go back. I feel like they would reject me or something, since I just kind of quit. But, I might as wel give it a try!  Thats all for now. -Travis-

      Well, earlier today, I had to go to the dentist. On my last visit, about a month ago, I had this, well, big hole in one of my permanent molars. It had been a cavity long ago but the filling kept coming out and the cavity got larger. Now, I need a crown. >_> I do brush my teeth though. Everyday, sometimes twice. But, I guess all the sugar I eat, didn't help but, I still brush my teeth. He had to stick one of those big needles in my gum and numb my face. It sucked, because, at lunch, I bit my lip 3 times and paid for it dearly when I got feeling back in my face. But apparently, I now have 4 cavities on my right side.... It's not fair. But, they numbed my face again. I was smart and didn't eat anything until I could feel my face again. But, for some stupid reasin, my jaw is really sore. It sucks.  Well, enough self-pity for today. Thanks for your time! -Travis-

      Hello, it's me again. Sorry I havn't posted in awhile. I just haven't gotten to it lately.  I bet you all are wondeering what the heck Capoeira is. Well, It is a very unique fighting style that I am fond of. It is basically a combination of breakdancing and martial arts. There are tons of pages around the internet if you use Google to search for it.  Basically, it was used by African slaves to entertain themselves about 400 years ago. To the slaveholders, it appeared to be child's play so they did nothing about it. But, once they recognized it's deadliness, they soon outlawed it. After this, the slaves still practiced it, but, they had to do it in secret. It wasn't till around 1928 that it became legal again. Then, Capoeira Mesters(Masters) Started teaching It more around Brazil, where it started. Then they moved around the world, teaching it. And soon, it was everywhere. Obviously, not EVERYWHERE like Karate or Tae Kwon Do. But, there are alot of Academy's around The world.  Well, there is my educational post of the day. Now for the real reason I posted.  I want to start to take lessons, so, I'm on a quest to find schools near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. If you happen to know of one, or stumble upon it, either leave a comment about it, or e-mail me. THANKS!  P.S. If you've ever played As Eddie on the Tekken games, or Christie on Tekken 4, then you know what Capoeira is. They both use that fighting style.  -Travis-

      Well, I have come to a fairly quick, alomst conclusion about this whole thing.  Ok, are you ready??  I am perfect just the way I am right now. I and funny most of the time, but serious when you or I need me to. After a talk on the phone with my girlfriend that I realized this. The only thing I really need to change, is be less easygoing. I let people walk all over me and I don't do a thing about it. I need to mature, but not go from 14-40 in 2 days. I'd rather do that over the course of 36 years. Actually, I'd rather just stay this way, and only get more serious about my job and stuff as I get older. So, thats what I am going to do.  I think why I wanted to change last night, was just seeing how Buddy had changed. I have a really bad habit of changing myself unconciously to be almost exactly like my friends. When I'm with Nathan, I joke like he jokes. When I'm with Shane, I joke like him! So, I guess in seeing Buddy Change like that, that 'chameleon' part of me wanted to change like him. So I wrote that huge post about how I wanted to change and such. But, I think I am fine just the way I am.  One other thing I would like to change though, is to be more independent. Not so independent that I push everyone away, But, just enough to where I don't need my parents in everything I do.   So, I guess that just about puts an end to my 'Finding Myself' section of this blog. Don't worry though. The Journey will still continue. -Travis-

      Well, I have made a small decision that will help progress in my journey. I want to be one of those people, who are fun, but not overly fun. Yet, I want to be very serious and concentrated. That is the only way I can think of to explain it. I think that is called down-to-earth. Who knows. But, I don't want to be completely serious and be a work-o-holic, OR be a complete goofball. I wanna be a guy who knows where he is going in life, and will do anything to accomplish that, but, still be that cool dad.(This, describing the future me. I am not a father right now.) Do you know what I mean? I am having alot of trouble trying to express myself completely right now. I'm not sure why but, I am. I know there is a TON more I need to get off of my chest but, I can't think of it just yet.  I guess I will finish my journey in later posts.  P.S. I would normally be asleep right now, but, after that last, 'breakthrough' post, I can't stop thinking about it.  -Travis-

      Wow, I feel all inspired and such. Well, after reading the latest post in Buddy's blog, I really wanted to find myself. In his post, he changed a whole lot and knows basically who he is. But me, I don't know. And, so now I am on a quest to find out who I really am.  I guess this should be the first official post of my blog since it is called Architekt's 'Journey'.  Ok, so here it goes. I know I have changed in the past year but I'm not quite sure how. I feel like I am still a kid and I need to grow up. So, I am going to find my place in life. Hmmm, where to begin.  I know I won't figure out myself in this one small    post, but it's a start. Hobbies, I don't really have hobbies except games and such. So, kid-like. Whoah. I really have changed. My old philosophy of life used to be to never grow up. Always be a kid and have fun. I know 'To never grow up' is every kid's dream at one point. But, I remember being pretty serious about it. Now, though, I want to concentrate on the future. My future.  At the end of my 9th grade year, I decided I should challenge myself. Quit taking the easy road. So, I enrolled in a few Pre-AP classes. And I realized that I needed to challenge myself because my life ahead of me won't be easy like it is now. Sure a was a good student. All A's and the occasional B. But, before last year, I just settled with the easy life. But not anymore, I won't. I haven't actually experienced the classes yet but I know that I need them. Some kids who have had Pre-AP english said it was pretty easy, so I plan to go on to AP classes. If they are too difficult, I'm not sure if I should stick with them, or drop back until I am ready. I guess I'll decide when I get there.  Changing my Attitude. Well I also know I want, if not need, to change my attitude, and the way I percieve things. But, I guess what has been holding me back for so long is the fear that my friends and girlfriend won't like me anymore, or respect me. My friends are a HUGE part of my life. Most of it, really. And, without them, I'd be nothing. Right now, my girlfriend is the love of my life and we have talked so much on how we don't want the other to change. But, I am strongly considering the idea of talking to her about this and how I need to change. I am really afraid of her breaking up with me though. We are really close and I am just about all she has. As you read in my previous post, her dad is going to war and might not come back. And her mom isn't exactly perfect. So, I am all she has. And she is really afraid of me changing. I am not sure whether it's just me changing into a heartless popular ass, or just any change.(I am not saying every popular person is an ass. Because, most in my school are pretty cool. But, it is kind of a stereotype.) So ya, that is another reason why I haven't changed.  Part of me really doesn't want to change. But, the other part strongly insists in me changing. I really need to think about all this. 'Till next time. -Travis-

      Hi again. Well I have a girlfriend and right now, she is in Mississippi. She goes there every summer to be with her dad. And I'm glad she's with her dad but I also wish she were here. Basically, I miss her. a lot. Ya i get to talk to her on the phone and the internet, but it itsn't the same as actually seeing her or being with her. We have been going out for about 1 year and a half. *whistle* pretty long, eh? Hehe, well last summer was really bad because I was a prude and I didnt say goodbye. She got really mad and almost broke up with me. But, this year, I went to her house, we watched a movie, The Last Samurai to be exact, and then the next day she came over here and we ran around outside and stuff. So I think I did a bit better than last year. But, her dad is going to war this September or November. And she really doesn't want him to go but he really does. So, there isn't much she can do. Plus, I feel bad because she might not get her dad back and I can't do anything to help that. Except pray that he will be OK and that is what I'm gonna do.  Well, thats all for now. -Travis-

      Hello, It's me again.  Well I have been wanting to go fishing for a really long time and I keep telling my dad about it. He keeps saying we will go and when we are supposed to go, something ALWAYS comes up. The first time, he wanted to go see a movie instead. The second time, he bought a pool that day. It seems he is going to great measures to not let me go fishing! He even bought some lures to try and throw me off that he wanted to. Oh and this last time, Well, it's not really his fault but it kinda is...We are going to eat dinner with my grandma and her brother. So ya, I think he doesn't want me to go fishing and become some sort of redneck or whatever. He also keeps asking if I wanna golf. Which is sorta a rich people thing vs. fishing. No offense to all you golfers! Or fishermen and women, I'm not saying you guys are all rednecks or poor. But thats just whats running through my mind lately.  Another thing, it isn't quite as bad as before but still. A tornado hit our house about a week ago and there are abunch of trees we chopped down that we haven't put in our 'dump pile of biodegradable objects'. So there is enough trees and limbs to make a pretty good sized bonfire. I keep asking him and he agrees we should then just like either changes the subject or stops talking altogether. So what I guess I'm saying is, my dad seems to be against anything I want to do lately. :P  -Travis-

      Well I was watching this series called Summerland on the WB and I had a thought. Ever wonder  why  some things are really corny? Well, if you picture one of your friends saying that or doing that in that scene with you and some other friends. It doesn'y seem so corny, does it? Well atleast not for me. I thought that they make them pretty unreal because if they make them realistic, you won't enjoy them as much because they seem boring... Now that I think of it, you probably all thought of that already...now i feel stupid. >_>  -Travis-

      Well I got a pool. It's not a neat big, spacious inground pool, it is one of those sorta inflatable yet fairly large ones. It doesn't have the hard plastic walls, it has the....soft, plastic walls. Anyways, since there is no level ground around my house, we put it in the most level, available spot. And, it's still not completely level. ANYWAYS, so we finally got it as full as the slant would allow and it goes up to about the middle of my chest. I went swimming with Buddy and my sister in it last night when it was almost done, and it was really cold. I swear I had hypothermia for a moment. But, after that we came inside and did stuff until we went to sleep.  This morning I had found out the he was doodling things in my sketchbook last night when he couldn't get to sleep, I suppose. But ya, thats about all that has happened since myh last post. Buddy and I are going swimming later today! YAY!!... Ok, I'm done. 'Till next time. -Travis-

      No, I'm not sixteen. Today was my friend, Teresa's sixteenth birthday party. We went swimming and had hotdogs and cake. I had tons of fun. First we just kinda swam around and I abunch of neat tricks off of the diving board like a one and a half, an arial, front flip, front full, dive, swan dive, and a flying squirrel to a dive. For all you people who dont know what the heck I just said, a one and a half is a front flip into a dive. An arial is a front flip combined with a 180° turn, so I end up faceing the diving board. A front flip is well, a front flip. A front full is like an arial except it is combined with a 360° turn instead of a 180° turn. You al know what a dive is.....hopefully. A swan dive is where you go up really high, hold your toes kinda, then dive in at the last second. Finally a flying squirrel is where you jump and hold your feet behind your back and then dive at the last second. Also, a flying squirrel is basically that except you do a dive in that same position.   After all that fun, we ate hotdogs. I had 2 and like 5 little chunks of watermelon. And then we went swimming some more. We all got in the hot tub and water was flowing out because there were so many of us. Then, we all tried to make a whirlpool, but my other friend Jacob was being lazy and didn't help. So that kinda failed and we went back and forth from the hot tub to the pool, freezing to death then getting really hot. It was fun. Towards the end of the day, people left and it was me and 4 others. We played 5,000 until I had to go. Then, obviously, I left.  :\ I wish I could be sixteen. I am only 14 so i have awhile to go...Oh well. Cya later! -Travis-

      Well a few days ago, Buddy and I went to this kid, Stephen's house to see if we could recruit him into nerfing. Like we preditced, he said paintball was better. Then he took Buddy's gun and my darts and started shooting us. He was being a moron. Anyways, after his bombardment of nerf darts, he went back home. Then, Buddy and I went across a big field to go to this waterfall in his creek. It took forever to get there! We finally did and walked around a bit in ther nice cool water. I got thirsty and actually drank some of the water! It didn't taste repulsive and I'm not sick, so it was OK. We finally went back later. It really sucked because I was itchy and his sandals were wet and slippery. But we made it.  OK, next topic.  Earlier today, I was bored and wanted to make my nerf gun look cooler so I cut off an unwanted section.  Here is the pic:   Isn't it neat? I am still not done modifying it though. I am going to put a pvc barrel on it. And, hopefully spray paint it....green maybe. :D   Well, I hope you enjoyed reading about my boring life. -Travis-

      Well earlier today, I was at my grandma's old house. She moved but hasn't sold it yet. And me, Buddy, my sister, and her friend went swimming. It started out OK cept when we played volleyball in the pool. Every time we scored, my sister would accuse us of cheating and argue until my mom had to stop us or we just had to redo it. She is a little demon. Oh, and you know those little pool noodles? Well, she and her friend were hording them ona raft and when I took one and replaced it with the other one I had, she freaked out. OK, enough ranting about my sister's attitude problem. On with the fun stuff.  Buddy and I sorta made up a fun game with 2 noodles and a beach ball. You hold both ends of the noodle in either hand to make a sort of hoop. You then hold the ball in it and there are a lot of tricks and stuff you can do with it. But, you do a trick and then pass it, or just pass it and try not to drop it. It's really fun.  Well thats all for today. {wow..I have posted two days in a row :o amaaaaazing.}  -Travis-

      Well a little bit ago, Buddy and I were out in my field with a stick and flashlight in hand. We weren't using the flashlights much because it was a spooky full moon. You could see everything like it was day. Ever wondered why when you are alone or with just another person at night,  everything  gives you the creeps? Well I have. Everything was giving us the creeps earlier tonight. The tree line between the tops of the trees and the sky was especially creepy, to me atleast. The thing that creeped me out though was the treeline was just 'hilly' then there was this little limb that jutted up and I felt like there was some evil flying beast staring at us, waiting for the right moment to swoop down and eat us up. Then, we started walking South toward this huge tree that had fallen a long time ago. During the day, it's a favorite hangout of mine. But at night, since all you see is a dark hole in the trees, its reeeaaalllly spooky.  Well, after all that, we went back here and he forced me to start the blog. So ya, enough rambling about my day...er, night.  Well, I hope you all have a dandy, full-moon night!  -Travis-

This will probably be my last chance for a blog before he gives up :P....I hope.  Well, thats all I really have to say for now! *insert witty comment here*  -Travis-

      You know, I've realised that parents have a huge effect on how we turn out and how our life goes. I've know that forever but I now know  how much  they effect our lives. My parents for instance. They let me do just about anything I want. I can go to friends' houses without them saying no, and, go to movies with them, no questions asked. I don't get grounded, ever, and they are just really easygoing like that. Other parents though, ground their kids after every little bad thing that they do. And, they make them do chores all day while they sit and relax, and, rarely ever let them go to friends' houses or go to movies alone with their friends.  I am just really lucky I have the parents I do, and I really appreciate them for it.   Ok, I'm done, just thought you'd like to know.  -Travis-

      Hello, haven't posted in awhile because I've obviously been in Florida! w00. It was fun. Lemme tell ya about it.  Well, first off, the beach was great. Perfect water, no jellyfish. It was great. Cept for the group of old topless ladies from some weird country. >_> It was gross. My dad actually acted like he was disappointed when they left, he was all like, "Aw you girls are leaving?" I was thinking 'OMG! DAD!!! SHUT UP! >_>.' But anyways, We went shopping alot and I got some sleeveless shirts, a hemp necklace, a bathing suit, and some goggles.   We met some People from England too. They were really nice. The mom and dad weere Trevor and Mandy. Since thye had an accent, she said it like 'Mundy" so my dad kept saying Mundy instead of Mandy. >_> It was annoying. They also had 2 daughters, one was 15, Jo Ann,  and ther other was 12, Jemma. Don't worry I didn't do anything with Jo Ann, she had a huge crush on my brother anyways. She was like a 'party animal' I guess you would say. She drinks beer at home and has all night parties in the forest. Jemma was cool though. I guess, never really talked to her much. I didn't really talk to anyone much when they were there. I was like the odd one out almost the entire trip. It was my parents and their parents, Taylor(my bro) and Jo Ann, Lauren(my sis) with Jemma, and Me with....me and my thoughts.  The rest of the time after they left, I was still the 5th wheel, my sister would like hog my mom, because she's just like that and my dad and brother woul just walk around and leave me there, again, with my thoughts. It gave me alot of time to think about what I want to do with Laura though. Which is a definite plus. On the fourth, My dad and I, the first time I wasn't really be myself outside the hotel, walked along the beach, watching the fireworks. Everywhere I looked, I saw couples. It didn't really help me missing Laura a whole lot. All I could think about was how much I loved her and how much I wanted her there with me to sit on the beach together and watch the fireworks.  Also, before the fourth, there was this group of army guys getting ready to go back to Iraq, and the eldest, Jason, was the son of the manager of the hotel. And they were right next to us. They kept making my dad chug beer from that funnel and tube, Lauren was freaking out, it was great. Anyways, they took my brother one night to a strip club, the night before I went deep sea fishing. Boy was that fun!   Lauren, my dad, Taylor and I all got sea sick, in the order. I've never been sea sick before and it suprised me. I only got sick at the very end though so it wasn't all that bad. Cept I didn't catch anything >_>. Oh well, It was still fun.  Basically, the rest of the trip was the beach, swimming and eating out. Oh and playing NCAA 2003 for my GCube. I finally beat lauren, she was invincible in that game. Then, of course, she accused me of cheating... But anyways, the trip was a blast and I'm glad I'm home.  -Travis-
