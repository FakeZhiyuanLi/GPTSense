       Goodbye Beautiful Friend   And everything goes spinning off again. Why can't things just stay the same. For their own good. Actually I think Im someone who likes things to change, but I prefer just a bit slower. There could be many things that Im talking about now, and Im not quite sure which one Im refering to. I think it's just safe to say that because Im growing up- because we're all growing up- things change. They get better or they get worse. I suppose Im just a lucky little girl and things usually end up great for me. Sort of like some sitcom/after-school-special where the main character (being myself) makes a mistake or learns something new, but everything turns out better for it (she learns her lesson).  Ever heard of a midlife crisis? I think I will never go through one. I've done all my "identity checking" already-or it seems that way. Sometime I will make a graph. A graph that shows CHANGE IN A PERSON vs AGE. How quickly the line will go up when we're young. Then it will slow down as we're older and we've all found out where we belong. Until then (this will sound very cliche) we will all continue to play the roles of different people until we've found one that we're comfortable in.  I think I'm getting closer .  It seems that my life is a sitcom. I have always thought that. The only difference is that I hear no laugh track when I say something funny. Or maybe there is an audience, but nothing funny ever happens. I would like my life to  be a musical. Like Renee Zellweger in Chigago (More like Chicog-DONT-go). This weekend I dressed up for my cousin's wedding in Kingston. My dress was beautiful. It was all the more lovely because I just love to get dressed up. If I had it my way, we would all where dresses and tuxes to school. There were tonnes of hot army guys there (cuz is in the good ol miltary), but unfortunely they we completely hammered and were hitting on other not-so-sober girls (not me). I can't wait to get married. The girl my cousin married is only 18. 18!. that would be like me getting married in three years! I can't imagine that. But she is a very mature girl and I really like her.  As of right now I am just exhausted. For the past week I have not had more than 7 hours sleep each night- Unlike the rest of the summer which was maybe 12 a night. Every day I've had to get up early and go somewhere or do something which requires me getting up early. I just got home from kingston maybe an hour ago and i need sleep. I will sleep after Im done writing. Im not often in a writing mood and when I am, I must ramble on and on until my thoughts run dry, and then after that, I will most likely find something else to write (or talk) about.       I havent seen many people from school this summer. That sucks. But I will see them all on Tuesday. Until then everyone, Stephanie needs to sleep, so keep on truckin and stay in school. -Love me

      This is just too much fun to be legal. Seriously guys, I recommend everyone to get a blog. Another thing that I found amusing today while I was surfing my way along the information highway was  urlLink this  . It completely reminds me of being in  urlLink Senegal . I mean those Iraqi people have a better sense of humour than we give them credit for (number 2, read number 2). They're also a lot more resourceful than us  urlLink incongruous  North Americans. My uncle went to Iraq 2 weeks ago for work (I'm not quite sure exactly what he does) and when he came back I watched a video that he made while visiting. I think the coolest thing I saw on it was that the American soldiers let the Iraqi kids paint some of their army tanks. There was lots of other crazy stories but by now I forget them all. Something having to do with oil and or gasoline most likely.   Tonite I am dying my hair. What IS the magic shade? well you are just going to have to find out... Stay tuned -Love me  urlLink )"  title="Comments by SquawkBox.tv"> javascript:SquawkBoxCount( )

      "Guys, are we going to be like our parents when we grow up?" One of my alltime favourite movies,  urlLink the breakfast club  .I don't know which character I'm most like, but in the movie, all of them worry about becoming their parents... Now don't get me wrong, cos I absolutely love my parents, but... Have you ever heard the phrase  "I love you, but do I like you?" . Well I might say this phrase came into play this weekend while watching my parents with other people. hmm. I still have some things to work out with them. But I do have pride in the fact that I get along with them better than most people (or I guess, teenagers) get along with their's.   "This summer's out of reach".  Ouch. Well i guess I still have a week left, but at the beginning I had a huge mother of a list of things to do this summer. I don't think I actually wrote it down, but it was considered a mental list. I think the only thing that I actually got around to doing was "learning to play guitar" (if you can actually call what i do with that thing playing). I'm no Santana, but I do play a mean Ode to joy.   Oh yeah for those of you who are just joining... us (me?).... this is my boomin new blogger. Now for a limited time only, this special offer lets you look at some of our friend stephanie's twisted thoughts. Read at your own risk people.  I guess having an online journal was another thing on my really really long list of stupid things to do this summer. I just started it now cos like what am I supposed to write about during the summer? It was fun sure, but does anyone really care about how sunburnt i got? I didnt think so.   Oh yes a parting word before I go visit my friends on  urlLink passions , my favourite website is dictionary.com. -Love me

       And for our next act we have a special guest   And yes that special guest would be yours truly. Sure it's been a while. A week today actually. I 've been pretty busy to tell you the truth. Busy with people (a certain someone who shall remain nameless who all the sudden wants nothing to do with me), busy with school (easy courses sure, but the projects are mountainous), busy with trying to find a job (the swiss chalet one looks very promising) and busy with drama (this is a test. A what? A test. A what? A test. Oh a test!). And of course dropped in between there are church and my inescapable passion for boys. All of this keeps me occupied, but for those of you who are loyal readers, please accept my apologies.          Today I went to Ajax high school for the day for the "Culture of Peace" commity. (That is another thing that keeps me busy). There I met up with a girl who went to my old old elementary school Lakeside. Shout out to Lakeside. Anyway, she showed me around the shcool (which also used to be my church, so it was sort of familiar) and there I was introduced once again to my old grade 6 classmates. WOW how everyone had changed. Short little dweebs became tall good-looking guys. Ugly stringy haired girls became big breasted bimbos. And the sad part was that everyone reecognized me. I don't like that because... well i prefer to call those days my "ugly stage" so to speak. So if everyone still remembers me from then, I guess I haven't changed that much :( . Anyway it was pretty fun. So yeah there is my trip down memory lane for the day. More later. -Love me

I don't know if you read this or not, but if you do, please know that I am sorry. That all I can do. THATS ALL. What else do you expect me to say? Everything else is up to you. You hold grudges. You should have talked to me. How the frig was I supposed to know??? I had no idea you took that little remark to heart. I am ABSOLUTLY sure you have said something hurtful to someone without knowing it before. How would you like THEM to react? To hold a grudge against you for a long time? How the frig are they supposed to kow that they hurt you bell gotta go

      I'm not quite sure why I put that on, but I am pretty frikkin bored. I love Isabel. She made the power go out (at school, not at home). Therefore, no school! Sweet deal man, sweet deal.  I can't say I mind being bored. I would have been bored out of my mind at school anyway. The only things I'm missing out at are my photography assignment (I brought a flashlight to school for the assignment today before I found out that it was closed, and I walked around the dark halls with a flashlight. What are the chances of that happening?) and my  spontaneous Combustion   audition after school. I wasn't ready for that audition anyway, so I suppose it is for the best.  In other news, I realized that none of the links on the right work, because of the format that they are in (its complicated) and I don't know how to fix it. So here they are for your pleasure, if you happen to be sitting at home today like me.   urlLink HomeStarRunner : This is by far my favourite site on the entire internet. If you don't find it funny, seek professional help.  urlLink The Onion : don't take it seriously, its a parody newspaper. A hilarious parody newspaper.  urlLink Ed The Sock : This one is obviously self-explanatory. But many of you may not know that this item of clothing has a website. He is the most famous sock in the world.  urlLink MayStarDesigns  I am a bit reluctant to let out this secret, but I didn't design the skin for this blog. She did. Thank you may! -Love me

       I will ROB you!   Yes that is the best title I could come up with. I'm watching Sabrina the Teenage witch. Old school show. Old school Jokes. Today the topic is The Battle Of the Robs. Robs are funny people. Very funny. Many of them (of the 3) you may not know, but they are soooooo hilarious I can't contain myself. And they are all funny in different ways. Lets meet the contestants. Rob Number One: Rob Potter, grade 10. Maybe its not so good to be putting him in this catagory. But the kid is frikkin hilarious, in a sloth kind of way. If you know him, you know what I mean. This kid just comes up to me in the hallway and is like "We meet again Steph! We have to stop meeting like this," and I hadnt even seen him once all day. Nuf said people, nuf said. Rob Number Two: Rob Saphry, graduated but for some reason still goes to Anderson. The kid is soooo sweet, but has such a crazy-weird-awesome sense of humour, he's not just sweet. Hes crazy weird and awesome. He used to like my older sister. And I would have liked it if they dated. I always see him when Im in art class and he comments on my art. Very cool kid. Rob Number Three: Rob MacMinamin, Grade 12. This kid is by far the craziest of the bunch. He was in  Tommy  with me, where He played the pimp and I played the Crazy Whore/Bag Lady. Neither of our roles reflected ourselves in any way... *ahem*. When I was walking home from school today he passed me on his bike (wearing crazy coloured Aviator Sunglasses) , And he turned around to look at me. I smiled waved and said "hi Rob" and he did this crazy hand-sign-alien-looking thing to me that reminded me of something from star trek. And then after he just rides past me, I see him going crazy doing swirving zigzag thing on his bike on the sidewalk. It looked like he was trying to kill himself. He didnt die though. you had to be there.  So yes those are the three Robs. They should all meet eachother. It would be some crazy (loving that word) Rob party thing.   Today walking home I saw a squirrel running along a fence with full sized banana in its mouth. Someone is getting potassium tonite. -Love me

       Mondays and Rainy Days Always Make Me Cry   I had plans, let me tell you. Freaking huge plans to rant and rave about every person and their mother when I got home. Walking home in the rain. By myself. Does it get anymore depressing. I wrote this huge long poem in my head of all the things wrong with the world and the people living in it. All the bad things that people ever did to me and all the wrong things that I did to other people. One line was funny because it went "As my tears mix with the rain and fall to the ground with thuds that no one will ever hear". And I wasn't even crying. How emo is that. But I came home and was warm and happy. Simple little me stopped making up the depressing poem in my head right when I stepped into the door. And then I made myself a sandwich and everything was better. If I had chocolate I'd be ecstatic, but no luck there. Actually I'm going to walk up to the store and get some chocolate right now. What an awesome idea.  That is an example of how quickly my moods change. Scary stuff. -Love me

       You win. We win... is it singles or doubles?   Its all just one big game isnt it? One big huge tournament that some people take too seriously and others dont take it seriously enough. As with all people who like to think deep and use common cliches, I truly do believe that this is just  The Game Of Life . I suppose that we all have different rules. Our parents taught most of us the rules of the game when we were young. We all looked to them for guidance as they told us "no you dont do that" or "yes that is good". Some of us win by trying, others just seem to fall into the leading catagory. Still others do not care whether they win or lose because they dont know the rules and/or point of the game. I think that is the biggest problem with everyone. I like to see life as a game that most people do not know the point of. We were all playing some card game with points. I thought that the point of the game was to have the highest amount of points, while everyone else knew that you had to have the least amount of points to win the game. That was the purpose of the game. What is the purpose of this game? Does anyone know. At least if you  think   you know the purpose of the game you can try to play it with your own rules and your own agenda. Some people just dont know and dont care, so they play off of anything that happens to pass their way. I hope that I will never be one of those people. Please no. I hope that you wont either. At least pretend you know what your doing. Maybe you can fool yourself into thinking its true. -Love me

       I hope you don't mind...   Looking different? yes i do hope so indeed. This was a lot of fun to change, even though i didn't really do much. im loving the skin for this. Im loving the skin im in. Lastnite I saw pirates of the carribean with Alison. not very many people go to movies with their older sisters. I do. It was fun let me tell you. Jonny Depp was lookin very hott. As was good ol Orlando. Im not really feeling like writing much, so I will leave. But not without saying this: American Martinis are fun. As is Gandalf the Gay. HAH. -Love me

       Where have they all gone? ALL OF THEM!   Isn't it just awesome when you have had such a crappy day. No no it isn't. Well today was funny, cos it was just awful. The food sucked. The teachers sucked. The people sucked. I can vouch that today nothing was unsucky for me. But unlike my usualy self (which for some reason I have been both avoiding and confronting at the same time), I was in a twistedly good mood. I thought (and even said outloud to myself at one point) that nobody else could care less if I had a bad day so I might as well just pretend that everything is all good, plaster a smile on my face, and laugh at almost everything. ALMOST. Some things you just can't pretend are funny. Anyway, short story short, I convinced myself that I was happy, and everything was fine. Another thing that I found quite amusing today was that all day I had "where have all the good people gone" stuck in my head. *punch line** no thats not the funny part. The funny part is that I was singing it all day long (humming it quietly so I wouldnt annoy people) and then right when I came home, somebody had turned it on full blast on the radio in my house. So I rocked on to that until it was done and sat down at the computer. Which brings me to the moment. There are also some other really creepy things like sam roberts playing on the radio right when I came home, that have happened in my short life. Things like when we were in New Brunswick me and Alison had the exact same dream that we both got a chinese tatoos on our shoulders on the same night! Now if that isnt insane, I dont know what is. That was one great mystery. Another one has to do with a door and a lock. In my house in Senegal, all of our bedroom doors had little latches on the inside so that we could lock them. One day when I was heading to my room and tried to open the door, IT WAS LOCKED! and no one was in the room! So I had to use a knife or something to slide the latch off the hook so I could open the door. But isn't that weird?!? I mean, how could that happen? I never found out. I never will. Maybe when I die I'll find out. But I might not. hah.         So yeah for this thing that Fathia and I are doing, (Im really not sure what its called, but it's an organization of some sort) we have to find out about children recruited for war. I've been doing some reading about it on the internet and it is really interesting. Sad yet interesting. 12 year old recruited to fight in battles. It's awful. Today is also september 11th. For those of you who are insanely stupid, this means 2 years since september 11th.... of two years ago. yeah. And I really think that I'm going to be boring and watch some crazy memorium for it on TV. Another crazy thing I saw on Tv recently was Macauly Culkin (spell check) on 20/20. The kid is like what 25? And he looks exactly the same as he did i guess it would be 10 years ago now. Talk about a fade out. Being gone for 10 years has got to be rough on the ol self esteme. And now hes back in this crazy movie  urlLink Party Monster , this ridiculously low budgeted movie in which he plays a flambouyantly gay "party kid" who kills someone. I mean, take a look at the picture in the article of him with the eyelashes. The kid is obviously desperate for a role if he has to take this part to be in the public eye. Or maybe he is just expressing his not-so-masculin qualities by playing the homosexual. He was "special friends" with Micheal Jackson after all. Don't you rmember all the talk about them sharing a bed together? That is crazy and sick.      Hah after reading over all that commentary I just made, I'm thinking I should go into journalism. So I suppsoe I'm done writing now. I may write again. I may not. There is no spoon. -Love me  *A snare drum and a symbol fell down a hill.... Ba-doom-boom-chhhhhh! hah hah man Im awesome

       I will make this quick   First of all, you just have to check out  urlLink this  out. Yes I know that homestar is a link on the right *cough cough, advertising*, but I mean you might not know how to navigate properly and You cannot pass up this opportunity. Another thing, for those of you who are both crafty and cunning, as well as took the time to read over the last ridiculously long entry, you may have noticed that I said I would watch Saturday Night live. I did. The White Stripes were on and it was funny. But that is besides the point. Saturday Night live is on Saturday (see the pattern), and surprisingly enough, the date on the entry said Sunday. I could say that this was intentional and I was trying to seperate the stupid people from the smart ones to see if you caught it, but I'm not that sneaky, so it was a mistake. Not mine. Heavens no it wasn't my mistake. The computer's. So I just wanted to clear that up. I know it's not the most exciting thing to read, but on the other hand you could go on to read more exciting things like  urlLink this . You have just got to love that old Glaxo. Peace out. And forget about the tshirt quote. -Love me

       OldSkewl Post Script    What I will now write was written earlier tonite on paper. Paper and pencil. Old skewl.   So here I am. Writing. Not typing, not computing. Writing as in Pencil to paper. This I will explain momentarily. I'm playing with a hampster who seems more eager to commit suicide by jumping off my lap 2 feet to the floor than just stay on my lap. He doesn't like me, but I'm molesting him. I'm also eating (or was eating) a ridiculously stale Country Style choclate donut. What was I thinking? I hate chocolate donuts. Now is the time to explain why I am writing this down rather than typing it. First of all, I needed to write. I wanted to. So I tried to use Blogger. But I couldn't get on the internet. Why not? Because this isn't my house and it isn't my computer. I am currently babysitting 2 little girls. Cute, yet strangely not cutein their own little way. While I can hear this awesome party across the street, I am here in this house cutting green apples to the right size and reading "123 Counting Bears" over and over again with less enthusiasm each time. Since I have been here I have not been called my actual name once. I've been Joanna, Amanda, Sarah, Rebecca, and everything in between. It's funny that there have been so many FORMER babysitters. *I just put the hampster back in its cage because I was afraid it might actually resort to ending its 2 month life.* So yes about the writing. After finally succeeding at putting the girls to bed after many attemps, I am left alone in the house. There are a couple of options that I now have.    A) Go crash the party across the street with the loud music and the hot guys.    B) Take aadvantage of the loaded people who own the house by eating all their food and taking any and all loose change that I find along the way    C) Do something domestic like watching TV or using the computer  Now watching TV should be my first choice, but after being forced by the girls to watch "Top Dog" and "The Holmes Show" (pathetic excuse for a sketch somedy show) for hours, I am sick of watching TV. I am sure there must be something good on, but I really don't feel like checking. So I opted to use the computer. THE IMAC. It was glowing like the Holy-Freaking-Grail, so I had to try it out. That didn't go too well. Yes the iMac looks cool, but appearances can be decieving. After trying for a good 10 minutes to figure out how to turn the thing on, work the mouse (The Freaking Mouse!), and find the Internet option... well I did find the internet option. And I'm just going to leave it at: I'm not a fan of dial up. I had guessed they had it on cable, but no they don't. Me being the good babysitter that I am, I opted for the non-usage. So yeah here I am. I'm not sure if this whole experience was worth picking up a pencil about, but I really have nothing else to do, so I'm writing all this down on a notepad. Great Idea Steph. I shall post this soon after I get home at 11. Will I feel like typing it up? Never. But I will, then I shall watch Saturday Night Live while all of you read about my crazy antics. I'm Outie.   Never done that before. Probably never will again. -Love Steph

      As of right now I have nothing to write about. Today was a bland bland day and I am not prepared to talk about the uneventfulness of it. The only thing I have to give you is the words of me. My words are this: never get sad in a week. Get sad in a month, never in a week. When I say this I am also reminded of this: A stitch in time saves nine.  Keep drug free and happy. "Everyone is entitled to my opinion". That is what I saw on a shirt today. I think I will write a shirt quote pretty much every day now seeing as there are many of them. Personally I don't think shirt quotes are funny. OK well Im not feeling like writing much today, so I'll say goodbye. Goodbye. -Love me

       What does it take to be happy?   Everything is exactly the same as I left it. I suppose the only differences would be that some guys' voices got a bit deeper, some girls got a bit sluttier, and the grade nines seem to just get shorter and shorter. I was terrified too, so I won't comment on that. Mr. FreakinHottFreeman is lookin better too, if I must say. Hah hah there must be something wrong when a student has a crush on their teacher. That only happens in Boston Public. While walking down those once happy halls (hopefully), I said to my friend I said, "Everyone looks so angry" and she said "It's 'cause school is back" and I was thinking,  no its the human condition  . Now call me deep, call me cliche, call me a  urlLink philosopher , call me what you will, but I still think that people these days are too angry. I know you are thinking "Stephanie, you are young, you are innocent, you live a fun and happy life, there is no way that you can comment on angry people and tell them to cheer up!" (you should be, for the sake of argument, thinking this). This, my friends is a good  urlLink rebuttal , but just hear me out. Things can be bad, things can suck sooooo much, but the truth is that many people are angry because of other angry people. Let me give you an example. Jonny is depressed because of something. Maybe he got a bad grade, maybe his dad kicked him out of the house, maybe he dropped his icecream cone. Whatever. He is angry and because of that he walks around with a scowl on his face and everyone knows that Jonny is having a bad day (for some people this could be every day). One of three things can happen:      a) Jonny can make someone else's day as bad as his by saying something hurtful to them      2) Someone else that is also having a bad day can say something hurtful to Jonny and make his day worse      x) Someone can say something nice to Jonny and make his day a bit better. This not only makes simple little Jonny happy, but it makes the other person happy too because they made Jonny happy  Oh yes how simple it is! You may have to read the choices over again because I worded them complicatedly, but you will understand. Yes I am simple in my example, so call me a hippy and give me a voltswagon bus with hippy flowers printed all over it and smoke filling the interior, but I think the world would be a much better place if we all just forgot about our selfish little selves and start being kinder to other people. You do not make yourself happy by having a bad attitude, but you do make other people happy by doing something (whether it be helping out your old pal Ike from prison, or letting someone borrow your germ-infested lipgloss) for them. Now lets all be happy.   It was nice seeing everyone again at school. That made me happy. I was surprised to see that many people had dyed their hair as well as me. That made me sad. I noticed that the grade nines are short. That made me laugh. I noticed that my history teacher is married. That made me cry. The many faces of Stephanie Mitchell. -Love me    ps: i think there should be many more young good looking male teachers

       Later that same night   Serious relaxation, eh steph? pph. That's not going to happen when my uncle and aunt are here. They're great, but can be just a tad obnoxious when they come over (which happens to be very often). They arrive, my parents kick me out of the kitchen and living room (1st floor) so they can have their "adult" conversations about cooking or mortgages. So I go upstairs, take a shower and try to make the best out of this situation so that I can have a relaxing night alone. I'm in my parents bedroom on the computer and doing my hair and stuff when I hear them going outside to smoke cigars (yuk). "Yay" I think, "at least now they are actually outside the house". Not for long though. The party soon enters back into the house and conveniently enough, decides to move upstairs. Me, in my pajamas, I soon have to make small talk and reluctantly move to the main floor. Im sitting on the couch in the living room and then they come back downstairs again. Trying not to be rude, I stand up nonchalantly and am about to make a break for the stairs when they beat me to it and go back upstairs again. Now I can hear their very loud laughter echoing through the whole house interrupting my "quiet evening". Man this sucks. -Love me

       Raspberry Jello and Test Drives   Swweeett. On my dad's laptop right now, and I don't really like this keyboard. I'm eating jello. The texture is kind of weird, but I've gotten used to it cuz my mom and sister are on some crazy diet that consists of tons of gelatin dessert. yum. That means I get all the leftovers.     Oh, there they go again.  I keep on seeing my parents drive by the house in different cars. They are buying one today and are having way too much fun with those test drives. The one I actually got to go in was some black one. Very classy. They were thinking about getting a mini but they realized that they are too small. Um, what did the name give it away or something? So yeah this is good news cuz it means that when I get my license I will have a car to go with it.      Yesterday I had to get up at !SIX! To go to Toronto for the day. I was there for twelve friggin hours which is far too long. I was basically there for a "Peace Conference" where students talk about different issues affecting the world we live in. Personally I found it very interesting, but I know many people would have fallen asleep. There were lots of hot university guys there, although I think some of them were borderline pedofiles.       I plan for this weekend to be very lazy. It's been so crazy for me I just need some serious relaxation. -Love me

       Lastnite she said   Im in love with the Strokes. OK the Hives come a close second. I dont care what anyone else says, they are wikked. When I start working so that I can make my own money and stop stealing from my parents, I will go out and get their CD       Can I say Something? Of course I can, this is my blog. I HATE FLIPPIN POLITICS. Normally it would be that i cant care less, but when i have to write a 3 page essay on it, it soon becomes unwelcome. GRRR. Stupid Literacy Test cutting into my schedual. But hey free special K bars and apples arent bad. Today I looked through the yearbook and laughed. Everyone looks so different from just a year ago! And I was in choir. hah. What a joke.        Anyway Im off to surf the net and listen to some strokes. -Love me

       Its just a stage we're going through   WOW im so disgusted with some people right now. I hate that people are so retarded when they  are teenagers. Thats why teen suicide is such an awful thing. All of us will inevitably grow out of being teenagers. Yeah it often sucks, but it will pass. Teen suicide is a permanent (awful) solution to a temporary problem. It makes me sick to think about it. -Love me

       The milky way has gone a little sour   I should start giving everyone more chances. I write people off too easily. I love strangers. I can relate to them better than people I know well for some reason. But I really do need to stop feeling like the misunderstood kid and try to understand other people more.   Im going to see school of rock tonite. If Jack Black were hot, he'd be perfect. Tommorrow Im going to my friends party. please explain to me what the "amazing race" is! not the show, the game. On Sunday I must interview a lawyer. There goes my weekend. I want a job at swiss chalet badly.   Im a really boring person. I just realized that. Have a good weekend kids.  -Love me

       Horray for me   *Horray for me because every day I turn more and more antisocial.  *Horray for me because I find foreign exchange students hot, even though they're really ugly. *Horray for me because I only post on here once a week. *Horray for me because I go on eBay ALL THE TIME. *Horray for me because I win all bets and games and prizes. And ironically enough I shop at  Winners .  AM I SPELLING HORRAY RIGHT? I DON'T EVEN KNOW.  Some really funny things happened to me this past week. Since I like making lists, why don't I make another one. *My grandma thinks she has magic powers. I don't know if its true or not. But when I went over to her house for thanksgiving she SEXED all of us. SEXED? yes SEXED. she got a "magic metal ring" attached to a string and held it above each one of us. If we are female, the rind and string thing will rotate in circles. If we are male, the ring thing will sway back and forth. IT WORKED AND IT WAS WEIRD. Something about electric fields. I dunno it was crazy though. *I am looking at guys less like objects and more like defected objects  Ill get back to you when I think of more -Love me

       I feel dizzy, oh so dizzy I feel dizzy and giddy and gay   woohoo. Yeah for some *unknown* reason I feel very dizzy and "intoxified". who knows how long this will last for. hopefully not long cos I want to think clearly. yay for honey. not the movie (IT LOOKS AWESOME!!!... no) , the condiment. Honey, for all you've done to serve us, we salute you. Here's your medal now get off the stage before I eat you you silly condiment. Is honey even a condiment? it's kinda like peanut butter and PB is like mustard, so I suppose we shall from now on classify honey as a condiment.  OK reading over what I just wrote and regretting it, but tis so funny in a certain way that it would be like murder to erase it. I am now regretting former actions.... yeah.  HAH HAH silly demetri. foreign people who send students to hospitals are funny. Do you know one? If not, shake hands with one and call him your friend. You wont' regret it. I promise. Get yours today for 20% off. Provides hours of entertainment. I salute you too bud.   We are performing  this is a test  next week. I am half nervous and half just plain stressed out b/c i don't know about it. Are we ready? I'll find out soon. Stay tuned. -Love (weird) me

       I was trippin off Kenny. Strong side.   That title has a subliminal message planted somewhere. So yeah this past weekend was a barrel-o-monkeys kind of fun. Met a lot of new people. And those crazy black kids up there were certainly crazy. "yo guy bombaclot. Bun you doodoo mye. I gots ma geeuze up in heerre. Heygaz maye wangtang yo guy." Actually I know they never said that, I'm merely dictating what I remember.  From what I can tell that means "Hello friendly person. You are awful at keeping score. There are lots of girls my room. Clean up that portable chess set, mate".  And then they threw peanuts and Nibs at us. One hit my eye and it hurt.  When i woke up today i sounded like a had recently hit puberty. The ol' voice still doesn't sound fully mature. Neither do many of the guys I know. "Dear guys, you're in flippin grade 10. Grow the flip up you flipping morons." And then mayhem would ensue. In a way I feel bad for miss langmaid because her only companions are her fellow vp's. Poor old woman who used to drop acid in high school (its a funny story, you should ask me about it some time).  Cue to coughing fit.... now -Love me

       Dear mr PA man... I love you   He's my new fling. So yeah I did actually skip that period. I also decided to try something new with my hair by getting a mohawk and piercing my nose. I also bought a skull ring and a huge cross to wear around my neck. I didn't really do all that, but I felt like such a rebel it seemed like a good idea at one point. So i skipped for JUST ONE DAY and because it is impossible for me to lie (its not that i can't lie persuasively, its that i can't lie at all), when the vp asked me where i was i just said "oh yeah i skipped that period" which was a dumb thing to say, but the only other thing that i thought of to say was "i was in the washroom when he took attendance" which he would obviously see right through. So i got detention and was the sweet girl who sat at the front of the detention room doing her homework But that was a while ago anyway.  So this weekend Im going to Muskoka woods. Its gonna be awesome. If I was a stressed out adult I would call this my vacation, although it is clearly not. Today I have to walk my neighbor's oh-so-adorable puppy in the frikkin bitter cold. Im pretty sure its snowing too. Thats awful. I listened to Christmas music today. Its certainly is beginning to look a lot like Christmas. -Love me

       Later that day in Communications Class   stupid friggin comtech class where I really want to do work but nonone else takes the class seriously. All i have to do is go on the internet and surf the net for a little while.   I was planning on skipping 3rd period today but Im so afraid of the vice principal that I'm rethinking my ditching school act. WHY MUST I BE SUCH A GOOD KID? I really really really really dont want to go to careers class. School is for learning and in careers class all we have a retarded supply teteacher and a room full of stupid kids and foreign kids. Not that I have anything against foreign people, but those kids are just weird. You know how it is. So we'll see. Yeah Im pretty boring, but oh well. OK bye

       Can't get a minute...    Will I never find you? Searching always almost by default Discontent follows me because I wait for you Only when I sleep will I find happiness Wake to coldness fade to darkness Grasping for the light the Truth Will I never find you?   I wrote that in my sketch book last year and only found it this weekend while I was cleaning out my closet. You should really try it. Its amazing what you can find in there. I found tons of artwork that I almost cried about cos I thought I lost.    urlLink Here is a collage that I made of myself   OH MY FLIPPING GOODNESS. That foreign guy is just too creepy. The other Ukrainian guys are hot, but the Russian kid who sits behind me is just.... Ok today when I walked into class he had this huge dorky grin on his face and was staring at me so I stared right back at him with death on my face for 10 seconds and then finally I was like "WHAT?" He's like "Hello Princess" and I gave a weird look. I sat down and said "Well if you really think I'm a princess then that's cool" and he was like "Yeah you look like a Princess. Like a queen. You are my princess" (If this already sounds creepy enough imagine him saying it in a Russian accent. Yeah) So this completely freaked me out and I started laughing out of nervousness so hard that I had to take a breather. He's like "what's so funny" and I just continued to laugh. It wasn't funny at all I was just scared and didn't know what else to do. And last week he wanted me to give him a picture of myself so that he could draw me naked. I think I want a seating change. I swear that he was smelling my hair all through class. NOO!!! He's at my window right now looking at me! He isn't really, but it sounds like something he would do. Russians are freaks. -Love me

       ITS ME, SCROOGE   I HATE CHRISTMAS MUSIC. Im trying to do a HUGE project here and my mother won't let me turn off the radio which keeps on playing the same awful awful chrsitmas songs over and over and over again. The worst is "Last Christmas I gave you my heart". Im going to die. But not before I murder Santa and all of those horrible boy bands and their renditions of Christmas songs.

      All around me are familiar faces  Worn out places, worn out faces  Bright and early for their daily races  Going nowhere, going nowhere  Their tears are filling up their glasses  No expression, no expression  Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow  No tomorrow, no tomorrow   I wish i had written that cos its so expressive. I love it. Im not a good enough writer to do that, but it's what Im thinking so that counts for something.   Its almost like a chore to write on here. I get all these good ideas in my head and I want to write them down, but I forget them and they dissapear. Then when I actually plunk myself down on the computer I have nothing creative or expressive to write. Thats why I have to quote songs and poems that I didnt write. Im not creative enough to think for myself. Bah Im just a bitter bitter person.  -Me

      YAY! "Scott from Swiss Chalet" just called me and wanted to know if I could come in for an interview on Monday! He sounded so nice too. Some things just happen to fall into place. Others don't so much.  Hmmmm... how do I put this gently? Sometimes people are better of just being friends. I hope it doesn't end up that way for this awesome person. You know who you are. I'm genuinely happy that youre happy.  As for myself, I'm happy being single. Really. Im not trying to convince anyone. I'm a bit tired from being over at Ali's house, but Im overall happy. Really. hmmmmmm. -Love me

       Just paint it yellow already!   And then when you go outside its like there are little white bees stinging your skin with enough venom to make it feel cold and then have no feeling at all. I don't understand all those athletic people who go skiing and snowboarding. 1st it's way too cold. You expose yourself to that for fun? 2nd its really really hard to do. I didn't go snowboarding though, it was more like falling down a hill with a snowboard attatched to my feet. yes, it was more of a falling. So yeah my exams were a sinch. very very easy. but now its time for me to buckle down and bare two of the worst subjects ever invented... science and math. Both of them are just too.... complex. I wish i was asian. then i might be able to understand them. If anyone can help, thatd be great. Thanks.  OK well if my lack of UNboredness doesn't kill me, then this snow prolly will. WHY? Why was i born in Canada??? -Love me

       Look at this girl on the left   I mean, where does she get off? And holding a martini glass? Whats that insinuating? She clearly has no morals or standards for herself. The way she looks so happy, but then if you really take a gooood look at her, shes not really smiling. Its more of a smirk. She has her eyebrows tilted like shes ready to kill anyone who touches her drink. Don't touch it. Don't you dare put your cursor over her martini or something bad will happen. DONT DO IT....  Now who actually put there cursor over it? honestly. All Im saying is that I think the evil alcoholic has to go. hmmmmm.  And The Plot Thickens.  -Love (desperate for inspiration) me

       Cos when the minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like weeks And a week goes by it always takes my breath away All the minutes in the world could never take your place There's 1440 hours in my day   If anyone can name that band, I will seriously buy you a car.  My posts have been short and sweet. I guess they reflect my mood. I haven't been feeling too thought-provoking lately, just kinda.... blah. Not very interesting either. just kinda... UNinteresting.  I mean I could always do the "Dear Diary, today I have to study sooooo much for exams! Im so tired and sad. Somebody love me please." But I would never do that. Or could do the ever-so-emo, "life is endless. i am a pagan to the empire of the world. i laughed at the rain today. God save the whales".  But no. ooh i think i have it, "lol jimmy smiled at me today. lol ;0 hah hes such a kidder!!1! lolz! much luv fo sho jimmerz! gtg mnab! jokes lolz XoX"  And now ive written much of nothing and not much of anything.  Hee hee I still think it was pretty funny that i gave the waitress my name "BurgerChick" at Licks today. That would have to be the highlight. And Jay, please go back to Russia. For the sake of all of us. -Love me

       yeah its been a while   Im questioning if anyone even reads this, so please excuse my lack of enthusiasm. Basically its just a love letter to myself. For someone who is as self-absorbed as I am, this is nothing too weird or drastic. So yes.... school. Tomorrow. Being social only cos I have too, not cos I want to or anything. bleh. I have a bad taste in my mouth already. The "holidays" (not christmas break anymore, im trying to be PC) were great, but in some ways I wish I had never had them. Cos its like living on the North Pole for your whole life and not minding it. Then you go to Hawaii for a month and when you return to the north pole you hate it more than you started out. It would have been better if you never even went to Hawaii. No I do not live on the North Pole. No i did not go to Hawaii. Its a metaphor.   Well its back to the great white north for me. -Love me

      I should be sleeping cos im so tired, but that is just another great example of how im like my "little-kid" self again and just stay up late cos I can, not cos i want to... if that makes any sense.  ... i love this song. "no rain" by blind melon. what a name for a band. kind of like electric banana. ...  All I can say is that my life is pretty plain I like watchin' the puddles gather rain And all I can do is just pour some tea for two and speak my point of view But it's not sane, It's not sane  I just want some one to say to me I'll always be there when you wake Ya know I'd like to keep my cheeks dry today So stay with me and I'll have it made  And I don't understand why I sleep all day And I start to complain that there's no rain And all I can do is read a book to stay awake And it rips my life away, but it's a great escape escape...escape...escape... All I can say is that my life is pretty plain ya don't like my point of view ya think I'm insane Its not sane...it's not sane.

      Maybe you'll become famous  Get caught speeding and end up in the tabloids.  Maybe I'll use those tabloids as blankets  Beg for money and end up on Yonge street.  Maybe you'll look young  Young and beautiful like all those other rich people  Who thank their plastic surgeons for a job well done.   Maybe that man will give me an extra 10 dollars for a job well done  Then he will leave the hotel room and I'll use that money to fill my empty stomach  Because I am so hungry.  Maybe when you get hungry you'll go to the restaurant  The one that has menus without prices on them  And you'll order a salad because you are on a diet.  Maybe you'll look out the window while waiting for your salad.  Maybe I'll look up from my corner and see that café across the street.  Maybe you'll see an old woman   Hunched over on the sidewalk  But she's not really that old  All the years of living on the street have taken away her youthfulness.  Maybe I'll see a young lady  Sitting comfortably in the restaurant  But she's not really that young  All those facelifts and tummy tucks have given her the appearance of youthfulness.  Maybe we'll exchange glances   But after a second we'll look away  Because we are just too different.

      what to write what to write.  a poem. it is written at the spur of the moment, so please be nice  I love everyone But do they love me? Is a smile the only way to show whats underneath?  I hardly sleep Even though my eyes are tight In a dream you can't control, is there really wrong or right?  I wish that I was in control But I know I'll never be Cos everytime I trip or fall you're watching over me  I love to write the cheesy poems Im too sensitive The only problem with this one is I can't think of anything that rhymes with sensitive  A really bad end to a really bad poem... I have another one that Ill put on after Im done awaywith this awful thing.... im putting it in the digital recyling box  -love me

       Cheers to you   But not specifically you. Cheers to Luke, cos he visits my blog ALL the time (or so he says). *Virtual Hug in the direction of Lukes IP address*... Yes Im quite aware of how nerdy that sounds, thanks.   I took Public Transit today to my Pickering-bound orthodontist. 6 dollars and 3 hours later, I'm a much more amused person. The bus goes from Oshawa to Toronto and picks up all the misfits (including yours truly) along the way. From whitby to Ajax I was the only one on the bus without a mullet and acid washed jeans. From Ajax to Pickering I was the only one on the bus who was white and wasn't wearing cheap hoop earrings. And much like on that show Train 48, there is ALWAYS some crazy guy on the bus who feels obligated to talk to EVERYONE sitting within a 6 foot radius of him. I happened to be sitting close to him, so now I have one new friend (or he might consider us pals).  I hate being static. I hate it when things are stuck in a rut and never change. I hate it when people are stuck in a rut in their thoughts and they never change their emotions or opinions. I might be like that when I get old. I hope not.  -love me

        happiness makes you cry   One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. "do you realize?" The Flaming Lips. I'd never heard of it before it was on a car sommercial i saw tonite. No I don't have a secret underground music club, I get all my tunes from commercials. so there. Lyrics are also tear-inducing.   Do You Realize - that you have the most beautiful face Do You Realize - we're floating in space - Do You Realize - that happiness makes you cry Do You Realize - that everyone you know someday will die  And instead of saying all of your goodbyes - let them know You realize that life goes fast It's hard to make the good things last You realize the sun don'-go down It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round  Do You Realize - Oh - Oh - Oh Do You Realize - that everyone you know Someday will die -  And instead of saying all of your goodbyes - let them know You realize that life goes fast It's hard to make the good things last You realize the sun don'-go down It's just an illusion caused by the world spinning round  Do You Realize - that you have the most beautiful face Do You Realize     I love it. Its making me cry. And I owe it all to Mitsibushi.  -love me

       my mind draws a blank   im such a little wuss. One weekend without much sleep at all completely puts me off balance in my mood and amount of tiredness (wuh???). So yeah Niagra Falls was frikkin awesome. Better than most years combined mostly because i wasn't forced to be in social stuations i didn't want to be in, and also just cos of the people! I love you all! I have a ton of pictures but because of the amount of homework I have and the amount of tiredness im feeling, I won't be putting them on the web for now. maybe once ive recovered some sanity. it's times like these i wish i had a personal butler. "Alfred, carry me to bed" or "Alfred, play me some relaxing music so I can sleep" or even "Alfred, my back hurts, mind stepping on it?" but he wouldn't be fat... that just wouldnt work. He would be kinda short with a mullet that I would fix for him. And then I would treat him to a relaxing day at the spa and he would fall in love with my nanny (who is also quite fictional). Off to do something that I'd prefer not to be doing! -Love (falling asleep at the keyboardddddddddddd) me

       Autophobia   Of which the textbook definition would be   a persistent, abnormal, and irrational fear of solitude, being alone, oneself, or being by oneself   Of which I also think I suffer from. I used to think I was free and independant, but when I became that "independant" teenager I realized just how much I need to be with other people. I hate being by myself. I hate having all the voices (not crazy voices, just my own thoughts) come into my head and tell me all the things I don't want to hear. To quote an awful pop song "I really am my own worst enemy". And I don't think it should be that way. Maybe it's the same way for many people; that they hate to have no one else for company but themselves and they drive themselves crazy. There has to be something wrong with a person when they must always have a distraction from their own thoughts. Sure I do think a lot, but I prefer to do it in the presence of other people. And right now I'm fairly alone... and I don't like it.  This house is too quiet . I'm turning on the music. -Love me

      Ashamed to admit my new fetish; indian rap music. Only one person can be blamed for this phenomenon, and that person would be stewie. Thank you for initiating me into your music club friend. I appreciate it more than you'll ever know.  Today i knew i was going to be late for school, so instead of rushing i embraced my lateness and made the best of it. I slowly got dressed, slowly packed my bag, slowly walked out the door. And it was a beautiful thing. The freshness of spring like a friggin laundry detergent commercial. I walked slower than ive ever walked before which is saying a lot cos im the human equivalent of a sloth. a freaking sloth. i took the long way to school enjoying all the sights. the muddy hills. the ugly cars. the half dead maple trees. it gives me shivers just thinking about it. So i stubbled in a half dreamlike daze into the school like it wasn't even mine. it was blissful. i like being detached from my school. i dont like the icon i get from being a high school student. Anyway, i spent the rest of theday day dremaing about what it would be like to be an adult and drive past my highschool and think to myself "i went there once. wow". I dunno it was just really weird. Im always looking forward.   THIS BLOG TOTALLY GOES OUT TO ALI AND MY OTHER FRIEND ;) WHO STARTED UP A BLOG OF THEIR OWN! CONGRATUALATIONS, ITS A BLOG!!! oh man...

      So i really never ended up writing that essay. yeah. probably no one really cares except for me and my english teacher. seeing as my english teacher doesnt read my blog, im the only one reading this that cares that i now have only a couple hours to write a whole essay before i go out tonight. And because i have a very short attention span and get distracted VERY easily, i have to take breaks every two minutes of hard core writing so i dont go crazy. this break im taking now involves me writing on my blog about how much i hate lord of the flies. Piggy can die for all i care. It would make it easier for me. Next minute's break i will find something to eat. And the break after that ill turn on the radio and listen for a little while as i look at the clock and think to myself; "i should really get back to work". rawr. Its a dangerous cylcle this writing stuff. It ruins my weekend and makes me want to kill myself. and all i can do is press "post and publish" and get on with my work. this sucks.

       this house is too quiet   a million questions crowd my head as i sit almost-alone on this thursday night... or friday morning... either which way. None of them will ever be anwered unless i be so bold as to ask them. but its not going to happen. so theyll have to go unspoken and unanswered and remain in my brain for a german psychiatrist to pick out one day a long time from now. but the one question i will ask and ruin part of the mystery is,  "why can't i stop shaking?"  im not cold. im not tired. im not hungry. but my body wont sit still. I tried meditating but that won't work. I can't shut up my brain long enough to concentrate on my breathing. you know when you get really freezing and exhausted and scared and all the sudden your whole body just shivers and you cant stop it? your teeth chatter and shoulers tighten. it wont cease. breath in. breath out. can't stop it. going crazy. if your body reflects your mind, mine is going slowly insane and rotting from the inside out. gah. someone save me please.

      procrastination strikes again  sweet. march break. nice. though it can kind of screw with me a bit and make me ask myself "what do i do now??", i love it. What a great way to just pull out my brain, throw it away, and just not have to think. its awesome. but i have been doing SOME stuff other than watching the godfather parts one two and three. today is my last day of doing-whatever-i-feel-like-ness on account of me having a mother of an essay to write and me having to serve chicken wed. thurs. fri. and sat. but its ok, ive accepted that. and i have done this to show my somewhat of a constructive attitude:   urlLink please click me   so spread THAT on your sandwich and eat it.   HAVE A GREAT MARCH BREAK EVERONE!!!!!

      MMMMMMMMMmmmm...  Biggest freaking piece of pecan pie ive ever had in my entire life. "Never again stephanie" says my very sick stomach. "Another day day, another dollar, eh steph?" says my inner cliche-saying self. Just got home from work. Rawr. The only pleasure I get is talking to the loopy customers. One lady started singing the Beatles "michelle" song to me cos my incorrect nametag gave me that name. And when I told her that it wasnt my real name she started talking to me about stage names and how it was much safer to have an second alias incase people were after you. Funniest thing ever. And while I had to keep a straight face and humour her, the next person in line was dying laughing. I'll always remember you customer # 71. Other than 71 and a few other crazies (many of the people who eat chicken are REALLY REALLY weird), my night at swiss chalet was preety dead. I love all the girls and guys that i work with, although theyre not the most classy people to walk the face of the earth. I think im the only one who doesnt walk into the kitchen hung over on saturday afternoons. Oh well, i love them to death. bAH! there goes MY weekend. Friday and saturday night spent ordering greasy foreign chefs around and filling up sauce containers in a hot oily kitchen. yuk. There are SOOO many other places id rather be and things id rather be doing. but come thursday, CHACHING! thats all im living for. That and another monstous piece of pie.

      I need to write a really really really long blog. Not so much i need to as much as i feel obligated to. I don't even know if people read this at all, so there's really no reason for me to feel obligated. But, really i can write whatever i want about how noone ever reads this without feeling like a loser because if someone just happens to see this, then that means they have fallen into my trap and have actually read my blog, meaning that I'm not a loser and that people actually read it. *breath*. Its like a paradox. Or a catch 33. or 22. or whatever. So yeah. Want to know my biggest fear? Too bad cos im going to tell you anyway. My biggest fear is growing old and never remembering what it is like to be young again. Maybe being old isn't as bad as I think it is... but probably. Relationships suck. All those expectations and uncomfortable...ness, and those weird awkward silences and patterns... well not so much the patterns, im just crazy. But really... i so much prefer things to be the way that they were in kindergarten. When girls had crushes on their guy friends and they sent eachother dollar-store valentines day spiderman and my-little-pony cards that said "Hang in there Valentine" and "I choo-choo-choose you!" Those were the good old days. Now you can have meaningful talks and whatnot, but I still miss those simple times. Im struggling to make this a long blog. Im really trying hard. What else can i talk about. Dreams. Symbolism. Birthdays. Tongues. Bright Orange. number 2 pencils. Ven dot. Pyra? meaningless. I understand all of it. It forms a sentence in my head. Not one anyone else wouldunderstand, but a sentence nontheless. So yeah imjust a tad exhausted from racking my brain for something to say... so all else i can say is goodbye! -Love me

      Good Morning!  Technically its a bad morning, but I'm not really keeping score... hey my very first morning blog, SCORE ONE FOR ME! OK so I look outside and have a glimpse of what I'm about to step into, and it's not pretty. Sad as it is, I'd prefer to have the old snow back than cold grey and rainy today. Then there's the fact that I have a science test today that will determine 50% of my mark (thats right, i said 50) and I have to work tonight. So the bad morning carries on throughout the day. I'm really just making a problem worse by taking my sweet time to use the laptop in the kitchen to write down my list of complaints for the day. Oh well, I guess I'll never learn. Wish me Luck!  -Love me

      this is not going to be an emo "i feel the pain of the world" story. as genuine as i can be, i am right now. forget who i am and what i want. forget ignorance. im sad. but not for myself, for every person whos not strong enough to jump and land on their feet. those who hit the ground running but never really understand the race. ok maybe this is turning out to sound a bit like an afi or some band as equally sapppy song. oh my. you know that dave matthews music video where that one guy walks around the streets giving everyone hugs? maybe not? well i wish i was him. i just want everyone to be ok.   on a plus not, i know someone equally as crazy as i am. peh. its not like im that crazy anyway. but then again, who writes blogs about other peoples problems. lets go be ignorant and selfish.   snap the eff out of it steph. go hit the books steph. shut up steph.

      why do teenagers live for sleep. its only supposed to restore us so we can get on with our heavy lives, but really it IS our lives. or just mine, either one.  just a random thought.  getting older is just one thing that i dont think ill ever get used to. although its not like i have a choice. i used to be this little quiet insecure little girl who struggled to look people in the eye and whos biggest fear was to have to carry on a conversation with someone. I think ive now perfected the art of small talk, and i now struggle to STOP staring at people. hah. Life is funny. Hilarious.  so yeah. krazy weekend. so krazy i have no choice but to spell it with a K. friday (sweet sweet friday). I get up and dress up tres early for GOOD friday. get up early. early. go to packed out church. filled with those easter traditionalists. leave. go to leahs house for brunch. forced to eat more than my little stomach can handle. wikked casserole. leave. go to my little brick townhouse in whitby. many hours spent with family celebrating easter. eggs. family trivia time. sweet. eat some more good friday food. good food. stuffed to the brim. leave. mikes party with ali. jetta with sunroof down. sweet. mikes party. party. bunch of trashy skaters. hah. oh so tired. crash on couch. my friday.  if i were actually writing it while it was happening i would prolly do it exactly like that. oh so emotionally exhausting. saturday was sooo much more... refreshingly unobligatory. deal with the aftermath of having a messy family in my house. deal with the aftermath of almost getting fired. deal with sleeping in my clothes with my makeup on. etc. ok those i was obligated to do. walk to steweys house. nice nice nice cousins. i really did like watching them work on the car :) heh heh. today is windy and uneventful. blech. uneventful. cept for easter service and goin for a "traditional" chinese easter luncheon and night service. and i saw a person i havent seen in SOO long. :) nice!   not that anyone cares how i spent my weekend thus far. plus a few days. minus a few more insecurities. la la la la la. heart.

       average is my middle name   ill be stupendously normal and excellently ok if i cant be anything else. i dunno what i am to other people. im kinda on the inside looking out and wonder what people see in me. i wish their were mirrors that didnt just show the exterior. Before mirrors were invented people didnt know what they looked like to others. Im still struggling with that.  i know im dead on the surface. but i am screaming underneath.    but lying there he rescued my soul his hours of pain. my eternity. just a single raindrop disrupts the pool i cry and hope mine will too. An unbearable empty lonliness Or the bliss of everything pure You decide.  I have.

      A LIST OF COMPILED STORIES USING A FEW KEYWORDS NEON GREEN PERSONALITY GOAT LIKE APPEARANCE BENDY STRAW HAPPY SOUND  there was this lil boyu and he had a goat like appereance and made his happy noise all the time it got annnoyin so ppl said he had a none green personality then he was really annoyin so they killed him with a bendy straw  THE END (thank you megan badgley)  The boy wakes up from his sleep becuase he hears a noise outside.  It sounds like his dog but he knows it's not. His dog is lying beside him, looks like it had a better sleep then he did.  He walks downstairs only to find his mother feeding a goat at the front door.  It looks like it had been rolling in grass becuase there are junks of green all of it he walks back up to bed to try and have a nap.  As he walks past the washroom he notices his appearance in the mirror It sucks.....his hair needs to be cut and he doesnt like the way he looks at all he tries to look for some scissors but he has none..the only thing filling up the drawers are bendy straws.  I guess his parents party from the night before was wilder then he thought...but as long as they are happy he doesn't care that much He walks back to bed and his mother screams up to him "come get breakfast" he tells her to shut up and he realises that he's got an extremely rude personality. He thinks about it as he falls back asleep  THE END (thanks for that award winner michelle)  the old man had a goat-like appearance, holding a martini with a bendy straw in the glass.  He told me that earlier he met a girl with a neon green personality.  I had absolutely no clue what he meant so I made a grunt in recognition.  It was a happy noise; so as not to anger the strange man.  THE END (thank you brad!)  I woke up today and heard a very happy noise.  My none green personality was telling me that it was coming from under my bed.  So i looked under and a man with a goat-like appearance was smiling at me.  He said that the floor felt like a very bendy straw  THE END (wipe the tear.. thanks steve hill)  there was once was a man neamed enis he had a very large penishis penis was like a bendy straw and it was goat like in appearance wen sue was it she turned into a none green personality but it still made her make that HAPPY NOISE and they had babies and they had bedny straws too  THE END (hot. thanks ray)  WHen ever i come to a bendy straw in the road i hear this really happy noise. Its riminds me of my pet cow he had a goat like appearance. even thos shrek was his fav movie he had a none grean personality  THE END (a joint effort between yoseph and sarah lewis!)  i was walking down the street with a girl named steph. It was kind of wierd because i had never hung out with a gurly who had such a goat like apperance. On our walk we ended up at the local malt shop where i bought both of us a chocolate milkshake. Steph was more intersted in the bendy straw. when we were done i gave the bartender a 4 dollar tip and she surprised me by sayin what a neon green personality i had. and when i was walking steph home, i came up to her door and heard her mom making a kind of happy noise...so i ran away quickly fearing the worst.  THE END (YES JOHN DEFINNEY!)  one day jojo the indian circus boy was a greeter at wal mart. he was the best fricken greeter ever! his amazeing neon green personality radiated onto everyone who enter the store causing them to buy crap they didnt need but one day this old man came in a very crusty old man crust everywhere he was funny looking and not ha ha funny terrible looking the only way to adiquetly describe him is to say he had a goat-like expireence * shudders* he came up to jojo and sayd meh looking all got like and jojo was like ah-ha! makeing his best happynoise but the goat man did not move the sayd " humbug " this goat appearance man had resisted all of jojo the indian circus boys powers his neon green personality his happy noise there was only one other thing jojo could do so he pulled out his secret weapon his BENDY STRAW and beat goatman with it then useing it to stangle him the indian circus boy then proceeded to stick it through the goatmans eye and suck his brains out  THE END (thanks sarah jones!)  there once was a bendy straw. he lived in a show that had a strange goat like appearance. this straw was named neon, after his neon green personality. this srtaw had a girlfriend and her name was pink. could u guess she was a pink straw. whenever neon and pink went out together he made a happy noice like this , YEHAA!  THE END (cutest thing ever... thanks ash!)  one day in never never land, there was a loud happy noise.  suddenly jack the rabbit jumped out of a neon green bush.  he was a brown rabbit with a bit of a goat like appearance, and the personality of a fag with a bendy straw in his ass.  THE END (mike is the only person who could make a story that offensive in such a short time)  one day i sat wondered why a happy noise never escaped from my stupid self. I'm still wondering why i was always alone. i mean it seemed like nobody liked me. i had no one. in fact sometimes, i even wondered if i had myself. nothing ever was joyful. nothing that i did. nothing that i tried turned out either.  before my last boyfriend of mine broke up with me, he said that i had a neon green personality...i guess that could have been a compliment--until he said that i had a neon green personality *with* a goat-like appearance. I was heartbroken! Here i was trying to be the best girlfriend possible...but instead...instead i was an ugly neon goat.so maybe i should just kill myself...its not like it matters i'll just take this bendy straw from my soda pop and shove in my goat ass, for im worth  maybe if im lucky some higher power will send to a neon green heaven where i can finally fit in with other freaks  THE END (thank you stewey for that ever so emo poem of sorts)

       shards of memories   required poetry for english. but i like it all the same.   Around 1998  Chris and I are playing on the swings at recess. He professes his undying love for me through nervous laughs. My face burns. “I feel like kicking you in the head” I say, and run away.  Around 1996 I am helping dad in the medical hut in front of our house. I try to be brave and hold back tears as I watch him sew on a little boy’s finger.  Around 2003 Going camping for a week with my friend and her family. I have a few beers and think that I am mature and ready to take on the world. My rebellious account “slips out” at the dinner table next week.  Around 1993 It is my very first birthday party. Lots of little girls there with rosy cheeks and frilly dresses, and one boy. My grade one love, Scott. He gives me a stuffed dog and leaves early.  Around 2000 My great grandfather whom no one has ever loved begins to take a liking to me. He never knew my name, but starts giving me random newspaper clippings about Florida and geese. He dies a week later alone.  Around 1994 I am walking along the dirt road and seeing that first African lady without a shirt on. I see a lot more bare breasts from that point on.  Around 2002 I visit my mom’s work at the War Amps in busy Toronto. A young redheaded girl approaches and introduces herself as Mindy. I reach out to shake her hand and begin to cry as I realize she has none.  Around 1991 Riding in the car beside mommy listening to the radio in our rusted orange Oldsmobile. I ask her why they call each other “baby” in love songs, and wonder why she laughs at my question.

       what a freaking swan   over at steweys house right now.... just wasting my time being polite as the basement gets cleaned. we are going to the place so stupidly known as the TDOT tonight. frig. is that really such a mind blowingly original name. maybe vancouver is known as the VDOT and chicago as the CDOT. mmm anyway. we're going with phil and i am looking forward to listening to kinky country songs in his van.   canada day. i hate when people block me on msn. popsicles. i hope someday they have paint smelling air freshener. steweys house is rock star fresh. its 6:15. I HAVE A SEVERE HATE FOR TRIANGLES. thats not a joke. i really don't like them.  no good things ever come in threes. i miss some people. indian dancing is for sluts. cell phones no longer weigh 3 pounds. its 6:18. dancing bears are awful. dancing monkeys are still humorous.  frig. hurry up phil.

      as i fell asleep, i wondered if i could ever be happy again. then with waking i realized everything was ok. happens to me all the time. what with my parents being in good old france for ten days (without yours truly) i don't blame myself yesterday for feeling like somebody dumped a cereal bowl full of crap on me. but alas, monday comes, and much like the song "I love that day"... well, sort of. i had to get up tres early to write a test that i didnt even end up writing until the end of school. then go to drama and stare longingly across the classroom towards him. then play hard to get and look away when he looks back. games. anyway. go to math long enough to realize i don't want to be there and leave. then i meet stewey in the caf and realize (for the 4000th time) just how much i love stewey. stewey i love you. then hop on a bus and go to  black central pickering. go to the air conditioned orthodontist and get yelled at for stealing paper from the secretary. draw about 10 pictures for the other nice secretary and give none to the mean one just to rub it in her ugly face that no one loves her. then go to the jamaican "soup shack" and order more food than the guy in dreads with the bob marley tshirt thinks i can handle. then hop on the bus back to school which does not have air conditioning. get hit on by some mentally slow guy with no arms and move to the back of the bus. Then i get off the bus infront of anderson and see a bunch of "bad ass skippers" under the tree. so i go and sit with them and watch in awe as they live out their "bad ass" reps. laugh on the inside. finally decide i should go to class and begin to write a test in a dark leaky storage room by myself. i can hear them taking up the answers in my class beside me so i quickly write them down. its not like i was cheating. then get a drive home with jordan in the oh so crazy diablo or mustang or some kind of old car with a T TOP. i like cars. even if i dont know what they are called. so glad that day is over with. sorta. the more i think about it, the more i will be missing the people i am obligated to see at school everyday. now i must be off to make some pies with my awesome grandmother. so long.

      Ok, so here's my predicament: I need a predicament. Confusing? Maybe. From the time I was just 12 years old, I promised myself I would never loose myself to that  thing  so famously named  teen angst . But after such a rolling journey towards the BEGINNING of adulthood, I find myself needing an excuse for being so confused. WHA? Simply, I need confirmation for my constant anxiousness, so I shook hands with teen angst and invited it into my crazy world. The sheer incomprehensibility of this post should be proof enough that I AM INSANE. The end.

             ...and the things we do to fit in.     music in my ears:   Boys Night Out- A Torrid Love Affair    i was watching the discovery channel and on the show that was playing were some stupid men hunting crocodiles for only God knows what. it instigated a question to rise from within. why/how the f-u-c-k do people find pleasure in killing an innocent creature. sure, to a lot of people crocodiles and other fierce [looking] animals are emblematic for evil and destruction, but come on! we all know that if we weren't so invasive of these creatures' habitats and lives then maybe there'd be a lot less fatalities or people walking around with half an arm. as morbid as this sounds, sometimes i wish creatures bigger,  plus intelligents , and stronger than us would roam the earth and kill us for our skins, hair, bones, and teeth...see how that feels. it's funny...we all looked on in horror along with german citizens as they were sent to see what horrendous, impalpable acts of unadulaterated evil the nazis committed. we were all appalled to see vulgar drawings and paintings done on canvasses  made  of human skin. we were all sick to our organs to see lampshades and other miscellaneous objects  made  of human skin. we were all terrified and deeply disturbed to even fathom that any human being could be capable of possessing such a vile hatred. but really, deep in the darkest parts of all men, we know it's there and it's real, and even if it happens that we don't see any more genocides like the holocaust,or the ones in rwanda and cambodia, we know that humans are cruel and will continue to be cruel, because many of us still subject other human beings to unthinkable tortures and futhermore, we do it to animals too! where am i going with all of this? i don't know.   but where is someone going with the idea of making a belt out of crocodile skins?

          when life isn't going good...i swear. i know i shouldn't but i do, because things can get pretty effing irritating. today i put in my résumé to the&nbsp;place i promised myself (since childhood) i would never work, and that place is...McDonald's. i'm so desperate now, however. i need cash money and i need it fast! it's a wonder how everything revolves in money. it really sucks. cause sooner or later im going to get sucked into that money&nbsp;obsession craze that everyone else seems to be in. actually, i think im halfway there, seeing as i am constantly thinking about getting a job to rake in the bucks. sometimes that scares me because i dont want to be greedy. i'm really blessed to be where i am, and sometimes i think i need to remember the bateys&nbsp; (ghettos) in dominican republic and how humble i should be, because we in north america have a lot more than what we need compared to the living standards of other human beings. and that's why i know that i am going to sponsor a child when i get a job. im so glad that steph did, and i think that it's truly an awesome thing. i honestly don't know why more people aren't doing it. anyway, i'm going to go for a walk, i need to make friends with the mosquitoes and have a conversation with myself.  love, stewey

      lastnight, after seeing anchorman with chris alison and scott and pissing my $4 pants from laughing so hard... i was behind the wheel. that's right: I DROVE. it may have been in a canadian tire parking lot at midnight, and i may have only exceeded 20kmph once, but i have never felt so good. and yes.... it was my first time. but i am scared of driving for one reason only: i do not handle power very well. it's like last year when i was MC for a school assembly. everytime i had the power of the microphone in my hand, i&nbsp;felt the strong urge to yell something stupid into it. im thankful now that i never gave into that urge. but when i was driving (very slowly i might add), something would just wash over me and all the sudden i wanted to crash&nbsp;scottys car into a lamppost. of course i was&nbsp;bounced back into reality&nbsp;by alisons cries&nbsp;of&nbsp;"WATCH OUT!!! AH WERE GOING TO DIE!!! YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOURE DOING!!!". so my test is next week. then drivers ed. hopefully the intructors will know what to do with a girl&nbsp;who always wants to crash her car.  on a lighter note, there is a hot guy cutting my grass right now. i think i shall make lemonade and offer some to him.

           the sky is a grey page banner, with green tree highlights-and the birds are the words.   i had a pretty silent day today. it almost felt like astral projection.&nbsp;as if&nbsp;i was there, but i wasn't...maybe summer's getting to me. or perhaps it's just the weather. i think today i'll blame it on the latter.   i think my many aspirations are catching up with me and making me rather miserable instead of hopeful and excited. so much to do, yet so little time. im sure you've heard that one before. and to make matters worse sometimes the things that i want to accomplish seem so far and distorted and just so darn right unattainable. im afraid to dream (literally), because at night everything seems to be what i want yet what i dont want--all at the same time...like i want the freedom to create and perform and just be real, but i dont want&nbsp;all the bindings of being &nbsp;"commercially successful" that comes with it...i want the&nbsp;comfort&nbsp; and intimacy of sitting in his lap but i dont want him asking me to sleep with him only after&nbsp;2 weeks going [out] together. i want, i want, i want...but i cannot have. i suppose that all these conditions and stipulations that hang over everything that i do or would like to accomplish&nbsp;must be a sign.  whatever shall i do?

            urlLink   &nbsp;  gazing into the eyes of defeat.   &nbsp;why is it that only the crappy, stupid guys want to go out with me? what to do? get down on my knees and pray? well maybe i will. and it'll go a little like this:   Dear God,&nbsp;    I need a new boyfriend..real bad. He has to be an intellectual individual, honest, humble,&nbsp;at least a little bit taller than me, as weird as I am (or even a little bit weirder), like trying new things, like strange music or similar to those in my BS profile, and he has to have a great personality. Annnd, he can't be a thug!&nbsp;    Love Stewey   ...who the hell am i kidding, as if that guy is even out there. anyway on a less depressing note (it's actually more of a weird, slightly disturbing note), i had a dream that i had a penis! what the butt is that supposed to mean?&nbsp;could it be&nbsp;perhaps&nbsp;my subconcious trying to punish me for posing as gay to that thug? stephy!! i think we need to hold another...HYPNO PARTY...  im disturbed without you. dying beside a mound of cold flesh was always what i&nbsp;wanted. a goal&nbsp;that tomorrow i will achieve...because im disturbed without you. im disturbed without you

      ouch! my face freaking hurts. that's what stephanie gets for thinking she could ever ever EVER take&nbsp;her&nbsp;porcelin-like complexion (as i so lovingly like to call it; others may think it pastey) to the 16th annual beaches jazz festival in toronto for the day without first plastering herself&nbsp;with sunblock.&nbsp;oops. although i must say, the burn was much worth it and well deserved. plus i got to see a guy with an iguana. that is certainly not something you see everyday.    newcastle , eh? yup, that may be my final destination before i up and decide to get hitched. don't fret my beloved readers, i had no notion as to where this so called "newcastle" was either, before the parents casually mentioned that we may be moving there. so no more whitby. no more anderson, no more trashy shwa characters lurking in the alleys and behind trash bins. goodbye bricktownhouse, hello&nbsp;seaside (or lakeside) detatched HOME. home. that's going to take some getting used to.   PS. i&nbsp;have since being&nbsp;at the festival&nbsp;been wearing my devastatinglyhip stripey tshirt as a du-rag (dhurahg?). but apparently i am the only one who considers it completely awesome.

      head is so very tilted and strange from watching the tv (circa 1989) upsidedown. and feet are numb from having them lifted over the back of the&nbsp;sofa (circa 1993) into the air. and neck is so very bent from making the stretch over the side of the couch towards the floor (circa whogivesacrap). any sane person would quickly realize that position can't be good for&nbsp;their body.   staying in good humour is not very hard for me. im almost delerious and quite giddy from angriness, humiliation, and sadness. i had an awful day and though i intended to write it all down from start to finish, i think it'll be smarter to sleep on my problems. not upsidedown though.   ps: i would go to a  three days grace  concert only if one payed me to. while there i would dump water on their ugly instruments and&nbsp;hope that&nbsp;the band members&nbsp;are electrocuted&nbsp;(and killed) in the process.

      intended on going downtown ( whitby ) today, but crap-for-nothing weather in Canada has to screw me over and grey clouds looming overhead don't look happy. so neither am i.  &nbsp; lastnight i was hypnotised. maybe better to say i  tried  oh so hard to be hypnotised, but with stewey doing it and&nbsp;being called&nbsp;DR LOVE i just couldn't take&nbsp;it seriously. we decided to do it outside with candles, and also cos it was nice outside. the mosquitos ate us. so when stewey told me to close my eyes and imagine going down an escaltor, i was ok. when i was told that my arm should be feeling light and should come up to touch my face, i started tittering and had to bite my lip. but when i had to open my eyes, stare deep into the candle and say softly 3 times " RELAX NOW "&nbsp;i just couldnt take it anymore. i almost DIED laughing.&nbsp;we were&nbsp;both screaming with hilarity. maybe we'll try it again another night. but for now all&nbsp;i can say is that hypnotists must&nbsp;be stone cold if they can hold in their laughter while telling their patients to bark like a dog.&nbsp;

       the magic bullet    &nbsp;  question.  is there anything better to do on a sunday night than watch infomercials featuring the lost&nbsp; souls of washed up celebrities and tv chefs? &nbsp;  answer.  nope. &nbsp; "the personal versatile countertop magician!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" &nbsp; speaking for myself only, maybe, but i am so freaking sick of this whole lazy summer deal. i am a taurus. that means i need schedual and structure. not the kind that happens when mom says "organize your sock door" or "volunteer at the retirement home across the street". structure as in.... as in toonie tuesdays.... or...... bingo thursdays..... or even...... flydown fridays (heh)....  &nbsp; that's it, im going to apply to be on a gameshow. alex trebec is canadian isnt he? &nbsp; &nbsp;

      i hate being 16 &nbsp; I HATE BEING SAD and more than that i hate not knowing why i am sad.  &nbsp; LYING on the couch looking up at the ceiling as if im expecting an asnwer to drop down. its like im always waiting for something. it feels like all i do&nbsp;nowadays is&nbsp;WAIT for something unexpected to happen, and keep myself busy until that moment comes. SEE A SHRINK?&nbsp;no. because i know very well what the problem is. the problem&nbsp;is that i take my life and everything/everyone around me too serious. geez. im only 16 after all. &nbsp; on a more artistic note, this is&nbsp;a sketch of my hand drawing my hand. the&nbsp;harder you think about it, the less you will appreciate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       struck with inspiration   or rather it chased me down the street. either way, the summer thus far has been very inspiring. besides the fact that i installed my OWN blinds (ahem), i have been doing a lot of grocery shopping as well. there is something so very peaceful about walking up and down the frozen food isle with a bunch of money, perhaps buying anything you want.  to make my life complete all i need is a minifridge and a bunch of food to put in it.   i haven't been home that much this summer either, which is just fine by me. as much as i love my family (or the scattered remains of it), i hate being stuck in that brick townhouse on estate cresent. we don't even take advantage of the AC that God blessed us with fercrineoudloud!   but i am home right now and i feel safe. i realize that i am not a very rooted person and wouldn't mind if my dad decided to relocate us to montreal (which would never happen). but as long as i'm in this small town, i can always dream big and hope we don't demote ourselves to a sheepfarm.

       steph is listening to:   endgame -   pilate   steph feels:   like a prisoner in her house with the turrential rain as a guard      it is days like this - with the scattered angry rain pouring down on my roof and my furry sweater on - when my creative spirit just flows. even my writing becomes more eloquent. i write songs (i just wrote one about my twisted dreams) i sketch (i am doing one of a baby and her daddy) and i write while listening to my rainy day music. after a while i become quite bored though, and like to find comfort in calling up old friends or bothering my disanthropist sister with a constant stream of questions which she doesn't want to answer. i feel quite mellow.       lastnight stewey and i were figuratively 'stoned' and just sat around listening and humming till one in the am. we are going to write a song about feathers and cocker spaniels tonight. stewey just doesn't know it yet.       the rain let up. i need a drink.

           so here i am, sitting here waiting for that damned phone to ring.     ring, baby! please freaking ring, already!     ring, so i can answer and voilà! it's a rogers video representative or someone else from another company that i applied to, offering me an interview. damnit i need a job. anyway, maybe  i should stop complaining and have faith, i'll get one soon.    demo, you need to get recorded soon!!!    i need to get my demo recorded soon ( and i mean really soon ) so that an awesome  urlLink punk  band can say "baby stew we want you!". it's just so hard when you're as underprivileged as i am and dont have a mic and almost no one who is willing to help. there's so much i wanna do and i want to be in a band by the end of this month so i can organize a show this october...perhaps  urlLink the brat attack  or  urlLink arms to illustrate  and a few others would be interested...i dunno. maybe you don;t understand...this is my dream...maybe you're laughing at me because it's a far-fetched dream... i don't know how many people that are in bands can relate to me with what im about to say, but i feel so empty when i'm not making music. maybe im an addict. whatever it is, it's slowly grabbing hold of me and plunging its teeth into my face. and damn don't let anyone tell you that that doesn't hurt. cause it does!  i don't know what else to say...i've always had a problem articulating logically when i'm feeling so...so something. if you want me as a vocalist and live in the durham region, click  urlLink here .    love, stewey

      i am still groggy from just recently grudging myself out of bed, so please excuse my lack of.... interestingness?  i spent the last few days in bowmanville visitng kate, whom i feel quite sorry for. she came down with the flu today, so i came home early. BOWMANVILLE HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST UNEVENTFUL SMALL TIME HICK TOWN EVER. i thought whitby was bad. i swear the coffee shops have tabs for their regulars. i wondered where all the teenagers were and regretted looking for them because they were all so freaking ugly. and when we arrived at the movie theatre sunday night, kate and i hit the "jackpot" of 13-21 year olds. but finding the cash wasn't that rewarding anyway because they were ugly also, and most of them were staring at me and considered me an outsider. excuse me if i raised your village's population to 5001. the worst part: i am moving to the town beside bowmanville, newcastle, which is considered quite boring and uneventful by bowmanvillers. SHEEEESH.  on a positive note... there is none. how can i look up when my sister hates me, i am sunburnt all over, and i miss my daddy.  what luck.
