       Alison, your subconscious mind is driven most by Peace  You are driven by a higher purpose than most people. You have a deeply-rooted desire to facilitate peacefulness in the world. Whether through subtle interactions with love ones, or through getting involved in social causes, it is important to you to influence the world.  You are driven by a desire to encourage others to think about the positive side of things instead of focusing on the negative. The reason your unconscious is consumed by this might stem from an innate fear of war and turmoil. Thus, to avoid that uncomfortable place for you, your unconscious seeks out the peace in your environment.  Usually, the thing that underlies this unconscious drive is a deep respect for humankind. You care about the future of the world, even beyond your own involvement in it. As a result, your personal integrity acts as a surrogate for your deeper drive toward peace and guides you in daily life towards decisions that are respectful toward yourself and others.  Though your unconscious mind is driven most strongly by Peace, there is much more to who you are at your core.

       Or not...  Memorial Day, the true mark of the beginning of summer and it's not even sunny!  Either way, summer so far has been really fun [[I listened to big boy's advice--Might as well have fun now 'Cause your happiness is done and your goose is cooked]] My summer thus far for my own benefit: Thursday- Cheered up through the delicious mega veggie pizza at mellow mushroom with Jana and her Mom, followed by movies and fun @ Jana's! Friday- Lazy day at first *w/ uh...some nice television shows* and then rescued by BRAD! who btw, had the convertible and Jana was extremely happy about that! Went with Brittney to her pool [giraffe and leech attack!] Out to subway, then to the movies with all my new "senior" buddies! Hurray for being a sophmore *lol* Quickie to see Maggie, then back to jana's..then home! Saturday- Jill's graduation, familly time, then out to dinner!  I love food..gawd i love food! Sunday- Brad and Lee to the rescue again! Headed over to jen's where brad proceeded to attack her kitchen, then went to see Raising helen with jen, maggie, her sisters, kenzie, and brad, while lee picked up jana, ricky, and laney.  The movie was pretty good...probably due to the gobstoppers i was consuming. Then we went and played a round of laser tag because it was thundering, then to the pool! It was a blast! My summer would be sorely lacking w/o them! Kenzie left, then we grabbed some munchies *thanks for the ring brad* and watched Grease at Jen's + I was home @ 11--perfect.  and that's my summer! haha felt the need to write about it cuz it's bound to go downhill from here!

       SAN FRANCISCO â€” The genetically engineered hormone that induces a third of the nation's dairy herds to make more milk is in very short supply now that federal inspectors found quality-control problems at the factory where it's produced.   Starting March 1, Monsanto will be able to provide only half of its usual shipments of recombinant bovine somatotrophin, or rBST, which is sold under the brand-name Posilac. The St. Louis-based biotechnology company also is raising the hormone's price 9%.   Consumers will likely be unaffected, because there's already an overabundance of milk on the market, which is highly subsidized and regulated to control prices.   The rationing is expected to last all year while Monsanto works to correct the sterility problems, uncovered during a routine Food and Drug Administration inspection in November of the plant in Austria where the hormone is made.   Monsanto spokeswoman Janice Armstrong said a small number of batches were contaminated with bacteria. She declined to speculate on what effect the tainted batches would have had on cows because "none left the factory." Monsanto contracts with Sandoz Inc. to manufacture the hormone.   Still, Monsanto's production woes are rekindling a decade-old debate over the safety of the hormone, the first major biotechnology-related product to enter the country's food supply.   The FDA approved the hormone in 1993, ruling that there's no difference between milk produced by hormone-injected cows and conventionally bred bovines.   The approval came after years of intense debate. Farmers, animal rights activists, consumer groups and environmental organizations had opposed it, and Congress even imposed a brief moratorium on commercial release.   While demand for milk labeled BST-free continues to grow, the furor has largely subsided. Ten years after the technology was supposed to revolutionize milk production, a Department of Agriculture survey found only 22% of the nation's milk in 2002 was derived from treated cows.   Monsanto, the artificial hormone's only producer, doesn't release sales figures for Posilac, but analysts estimate it accounts for about $300 million, or 5%, of the company's annual sales.   Still, the production cutback isn't expected to dramatically alter Monsanto's profits.   "There are a lot of factors that affect the milk supply and this is just a small blip on the radar," said Steven Larson, managing editor of the trade journal Hoard's Dairyman. Bigger factors influencing production include weather, feed quality and cow prices, Larson said.   The Posilac problem also won't likely slow Monsanto's recent momentum on Wall Street, where its stock price has surged near its 52-week high. Last week, UBS analyst Andrew Cash wrote a rosy report predicting that Monsanto would exceed profit expectations in 2004.   The cutback did prompt a price spike for milk futures, and analysts predict a 1% to 2% tightening of milk output in 2004 because of the Posilac shortage. That should lead to slight increases in wholesale prices, a small silver lining for dairy farmers.   "Milk prices have been depressed for a couple of years because of a glut," said Darrell Reece, who administers Posilac to most of the 200 dairy cows on his family farm in Knob Lick, Ky.   Reece said he and his family have used Posilac since the FDA first approved the hormone and credits it with increasing milk production by as much as 15%.   Posilac is made by taking a cow's growth-hormone gene and splicing it into bacteria brewed in great quantities in giant vats. The hormone produced in the bacteria is extracted, purified and injected back into cows, stimulating them to produce more milk.   Organic farmers and animal welfare organizations still argue that no scientific consensus exists about the hormone's health consequences on people and cows. Canada and Europe ban the hormone, mostly out of concern that it makes cows more prone to illness.   Now, some of the opposition groups are asking the FDA for more details on Monsanto's quality-control problems.   "It calls into question yet again the safety of this product," said Joe Mendelson of the Center for Food Safety, which unsuccessfully petitioned the FDA in 1999 to withdraw approval. "We are again looking into it deeply."   Even before Monsanto's factory woes, many conventional dairy farmers were questioning the benefit of the hormone, which must be injected every two weeks for several months a year. Each dose costs between $5.15 and $5.80. And treated cows need to be fed more and require more attention than other cows.   "It certainly has had less of an impact than other technology," said University of Wisconsin-Madison farming economist Jeremy Foltz. "This is technology that is not really vital to the dairyman's bottom line."

So went to chapel hill with my mom which is always a fun drive! Simiply because i use the 45 minutes to listen to good music. Hadta get my panoramic xray around 3 and then my actual appt was @ 4.

It was really good + i got this cute shirt at some store down the street! And guess who i saw?!  HARRY!! haha--i havent seen him since school ended so that was nice! I've missed big H-dog.    Headed back to raleigh, talked on line, and then i was KIDNAPPED!! *haha* Aaron and McCall came over and we were gonna go see Fahrenheit 9/11 but of course it was sold out--opening day and all. So we ended up going back to McCall's house and watching the royal tenenbaums [sp?] I liked it a lot.  Got to meet McCall's parents, attempt to eat a triscuit with my hurty teeth, and meet inbred scout.  Got home around midnight and read Bodiily Harm by Atwood until 1.    Woke up today, showered, and now im spending the day w/ CHRIS whose finally back from the beach!  Woohoo for everyone coming back to raleigh!

I mean we keep in touch but we havent seen eachother in like, 6 months since we're both really busy during the school year. We went to the mall together today and it was great.  We just get along so perfectly that we have so much fun together, no having to worry about annoying the other one w/ our quirky behaviors or anything like that [like extreme matchy clothing or tanning of strange body areas]! It just feels like we saw eachother like 2 days ago or something..haha its great! So we're gonna try to see eachother at least a few more times over the summer when we're both in town and not too busy!   After the mall i went to the library w/ my Dad! Got one of the books i needta read for school, along with 2 more that ive been wanting to read, and the 3rd in a trilogy i wanted! So now i have something else to keep me entertained! Tomorrow i have ortho..wow i probably shoulda been wearing my elastics more.  Oh well!

Chilled this morning--ya know, the whole internet and munchies thing!  Spent the majority of my day @ optimist *6 hours* but it was pretty fun, least to begin w/ when more pple were working.  After the thunderstorm some lifeguards and stuff got sent home so it became kinda boring, but it wasnt too shabby.  Got a smoothie w/ Allie *she stole my NAME!* b4 hand so that lasted me awhile! along with my yummy bagel and watermelon! *haha* wow it actually sounds like i eat HEALTHY! so maybe i wont mention what i just ate out of my dad's father's day present just now! *haha* Hadta close out by myself with only a little bit of help from mean susan..gr! But yeah im proud of myself for that! Even if it did take a while.  Not working tomorrow but we'll see what i do.

       Jill and Dad left for Boston yesterday for Jill's BU orientation.  Will not repeat the story of why I'm not going, it's been asked 50 times before.  Just know this--ALI IS IN RALEIGH! So this week should be interesting, probably lots of movie watching, junk food eating, and shopping.  Sounds alright to me. [[already done all 3, intolerable cruelty, triangle, fudge]]

       I'm feeling...philosophical and moody--quite strange for me.  I just started to think about how much I've changed in the past year.  I'm just different and it's finally hitting me how much everyone else has changed [[or havent changed in some cases]]  Not exactly sure how i feel about this.  Overall, thankfully, i feel like ive changed for the better [[even tho its hard to feel as smart @ RCHS unlike @ east where i could easily shine w/o trying]] I just..i dno I'm more dedicated to what i want now and just...my personality is changing.  I no longer place so much value on what other pple say, what other people think.  I know the truth and thats all that should matter, I know why i do the things i do.  Yes, i still have times when i care way too much about other pple's opinions and other pple still hold the power to hurt me more than maybe they 'should' but it's not the same as it usedta be. It just kinda hit me that I've developed my own views about life more this year than ever before.  Yes, I'm also still very...'me' or the way i was i just! AH! i dno how to explain it! Think about where you were a year before now and what you might have been thinking, feeling.  In my case, it's a helluva lot different than now, everything is.

       Second friday outta school and tis great! Went shopping with caitlin! That was a blast *gang, condom pockets on shoulders, ride a cowboy!*--even tho i had no money! haha! Found a skirt that i simply adore at express, gonna hafta buy it once i get my miniscule paycheck.  Then came home, ate yummy dinner, and then went with ELLY SPINELLY to see Shrek 2! Woah, I've missed her like crazy! It's great seeing old friends that even though we've both changed, we're still really close! So walked into see shrek but elly spontaneously decided to go see stepford wives! so we went to see taht! *it was super crowded* It was pretty good! [[halfway thru the movie this huge thunder/lightning knocked out the power for a sec, then the noise on the movie was gone and very lightly in the background you could hear, Day-o, day-ay-ay-o Daylight come and he wan' go home--haha]] I was supposed to see it today with some gals and then go swimming but i dno if i can cuz Jill and my dad's flight to boston is tonight.  Oh well, we'll see. Then El slept over, looking through the RCHS yearbook, talking bout old stuff, new stuff, everything. She hadta leave early this lovely saturday morning tho cuz her cousin is flying in.  So now im just eating breakfast and listening to Rooney.

So i started walking *long story, but i get picked up down the road cuz i like walking* and get stuck in the pouring rain becuz my dad is really late.  And do i have a cell fone to call home and ask on? NO! my fucking family needs to catch up with technology.  I'm working not too close to home and i NEED A FONE!

       Monday I hung around the house and packed and stuff before me and christine headed over to Caitlins to make her birthday cake! *hurray!* Caitlin had some people over to celebrate her birthday [[you young'n]] *andrew, dan, christine, mark, brittney, a3, brad, lee, jana, and kc* We went swimming and hung out at the pool [[ended up getting in trouble for the slip n slide and mud wrestling..lol neither of which i participated in but it looked fun!]] Then went over and had dinner, hung out, then watched the hockey game! I wish that Calgary had won but oh well...thnx for telling me when they scored tho brad! *haha* Everyone headed out around 11 or 11 30 then me, jana, and christine, stayed over, decorated and ate the cake, then told 'stories' til the middle of the night!  Yesterday was pretty good, cinnamon rolls 4 breakfast thanks to andrew and watching UGLY make over stories on TLC.  I swear they gave them the worst clothes and make up i have EVER seen! *ick* Went swimming w/ Jill @ opt. then it thundered so the pool closed right before i started my shift but i still had plenty of work to do cuz we were getting tons of fone calls.  Work was good, read more of Anna Karenina because hardly anyone was there, cept someone screwed up the register earlier so we were 9 bucks short..screw that [[oh well we fixed it]] Watched tv..talked on the fone..normal night! No work today cept for an inservice tonight for an hour.

       Reading Anna Karenina by Tolstoy.  I like it so far, but then again im on page 35 out of 811!  Went shopping w/ my mom again and got some stuff! *hurray* Its really beginning to feel like summer!  "I cannot admit it.  I cannot in any case agree with Keiss that my whole conception of the external world has been derived from perceptions. The most fundamental idea, the idea of existence, has not been received by me through sensation; indeed, there is no special sense-organ for the transmission of such an idea."  "Yes, but they--Wurt, and Knaust, and Pripasov--would answer that your consciousness of existence is derived from the conjunction of all your sensations, that that consciousness of existence is the result of your sensations. Wurt, indeed, says plainly that, assuming there are no sensations, it follows that there is no idea of existence."  "I maintain the contrary."  "According to that, if my senses are annihilated, if my body is dead, I can have no existence of any sort?"   --excerpts from a philosophical conversation in AK

       Called to see if your back  Was still aligned and your sheets Were growing grass all on the corners of your bed  But you've got too much to wear on your sleeves It has too much to do with me And secretly I want to bury in the yard The grey remains of a friendship scarred  You told us of your new life there  You got someone comin' around Gluing tinsel to your crown  He's got you talking pretty loud  You berate remember your ailing heart and your criminal eyes  You say you're still in love If it's true what can be done It's hard to leave all those moments behind  You tested your metal of doe's skin and petals While kissing the lipless Who bleed all the sweetness away   So yesterday i ended up working the whole 4 and 1/2 hours that i was supposed to! Still don't have like any hours this week, but i guess its not really a big deal--I dont hafta make a ton of money. I wouldn't mind...but i like having my free time.

I could hardly see in front of me.  Then at 2 i headed over to optimist, woohoo for being a cashier! There was like no one there cuz of the weather, then we hadta close for like an hour due to thunder, but hey, its all good! I wasnt TOO bored and im now great at saying 'Optimist pool, this is alison speaking' alison..ahh my full name freaks me out sometimes, makes me feel old n shit, but theres another "ally" so w/e! S'posed to work til 9, but like 5 pple were in the pool so most of us headed home.  So Brad left for the beach tonight along with a bunch of my other buds [but he'll be back by monday] and mccall's leaving for costa rica tmrw morning [how dare u leave for 3 weeks mccall] *boo on the lucky pple that get to escape raleigh* [altho i hafta admit this summer has rocked so far] Tmrw i hafta drive again, then work again! *haha* oh well as of monday..or prolly tuesday since my mom gets the afternoon off, i will have my PERMIT!!

Went to see Troy with McCall! I thought it was pretty good, though i couldn't exactly hope for a happy ending and my "celeb soulmate" was a bit of a wimp! Now they can make the odyssey movie! Saw florian, eric, marie, and josh after the movie [[no, not all together!]] And now im home and being lazy while watching scream 2, for although it might be a horrible horror movie, it's perfect to pig out during! *thats ME!*  [mccall, my partner fatty]  troy=fight scene, choir music, fight scene, almost sex scene, fight, almost sex scene, enya-like music, repeated!

       Cute  Your natural, no nonsense approach to life is like a breath of fresh air in the hoopla of Hollywood. A sweetheart like you would be best matched with a celeb who's as down-to-earth as you are. Someone who is cute and fun to be around is what it'll take to make your heart go pitter-patter. A cutie pie like Orlando Bloom is just what the love doctor ordered for you.  You and your perfect partner would have a blast on low-key dates away from all the glitz and glam of Tinseltown. What could be better than a quiet night at home with a movie, popcorn, and plenty of one-on-one time with your beloved? So, pop in a DVD and enjoy a cozy night with your celeb soul mate! And if your celeb soul mate can't make it, someone sweet is probably waiting to curl up with a cutie like you! So get out there and meet them!

       Alison, you're a Cocker Spaniel! No bones about it, you're a perky, loving Cocker Spaniel. (Think Lady from Lady and the Tramp.) Playful and energetic, you're a real people person â€” er, dog. People can't help but fall hook, line, and sinker for your friendly, well-rounded personality and natural charm. It's a subtle thing, though â€” being outgoing and flirtatious, not showy, is the name of your game. Friends, co-workers, and potential dates can't help liking you. How could they not? Your winning-yet-humble ways make you popular, admired, and a joy to be around. Woof!  http://connect.tickle.com/test.html?t=dogogt  Go take it! Neways, woke up this morning to the lovely fone ringing, turned out be to drivers ed and that i was FINALLY gonna get to go driving! SHEESH! so from 930 to 130 I was driving with this other kid, chris *a jr at millbrook* it was fine cept i was so NeRVouS! Gotta go it again for 4 more hours friday and 4 more saturday..so now cocker spaniels can DRIVE!

Haha, that was a blast! Minus the mixing of gum flavors-ew. The ziti was good tho! And I think the clothes are Hollister are missing some material... Went swimming at Caitlins [[skinks, water rescue tube, group shower, water raspberries]] then andrew left and the 3 of us had fun goofing around, looking at pictures, sharing stories on caitlins bed, and learning how to ride the motor scooter *hah* Plus dinner was yumfro! All in all, it was a great day and I'm glad my summer hasnt started to go downhill... YET!

       So yesterday was pretty good.  Ortho wasnt QUITE as bad as i thought it would be, but it still made me mad cuz i think im gonna have on my braces til like, december.  WHICH SUCKS!!!!  After chapel hill my mom and i got smoothies and then her car broke down! GR! [[in a year will be my car!]] So we hadta walk home and then my mom drove me to work in the other car...fun. Work was fine except i had a killer headache.  Josh was being kinda annoying too cuz he wanted me to stay and work til 8 for him and i was like, sorry i have a social life too buddy! Around 6 i got off and carly, caitlin, sapir, and a3 picked me up.  We went to crabtree and shopped [[chocolate @ godiva, clinique, dorks @ eb games, comfy chairs, etc]] then we went to target, got sapir an mp3 player and bubblegum, then went back to a3s.  Called some pple, played video games, hung out, the norm.  Carly brought me home around 1130 and then she hadta take everyone else home too..long story but that was SO frustrating.  Today i hadta get up super DUPER early [6] to work until 3 during the swim meet.  Finished dawn tho=only writing left of summer work! The swim meet was pretty boring tho [[ages 25- like 70]], went home about 3, and now JANBAN'S over! *yay* We're gonna go see The Village tonight! Gotta love scary movies.

Shoulda been fun w/ andrew, kristine, jackie, alex, and robert working..but w/e. Maybe i'm just in a sour mood now and it actually wasnt that bad while i was there.&nbsp; Or maybe im mad that i have ortho tmrw.&nbsp;

       Been a little while.&nbsp; Monday Alli came and picked me up, we got smoothies, then i swam laps @ work until i actually started working @ 1130.&nbsp; Work was fine, i was supposed to get off @ 7 but Robert asked me to stay til 8 [we were low on pple] so i stayed but didnt hafta fill out all the closing forms-YES! Went to the mall w/ my mom for a bit to return some of Jill's and my Dad's things--i bought these awesome shoes and this little sweatshirt that i adore.&nbsp; Called jana's cuz i knew she was getting in monday, but her plane wasnt landing til about 1130 that night.&nbsp; However, her mom told me her schedule and YAY we have spanish together-unfort. nothing else! BOO!   Tuesday was my day off.&nbsp; Jana and Ricky came by to pick up me and dan and we went and hung out over there for awhile!&nbsp; It was so much fun catching up with her + playing the fortune game! *lol* Then we celebrated Henry's birthday= dinner, cake, and presents! Then we went to see the Bourne Supremacy w/ Henry, Pete, Janban's mom, jana, and me while ricky and dan watched anchorman. Left around 10 cuz I hadta work this morning.  Today was pretty tedious- esp. in the latter hours of working.&nbsp; Worked from 6 45 to 4 15, crazy huh?&nbsp; However...means money!&nbsp; By myself in the morning w/ Steve shifting, then Alli came in, then Alex [whose no help].&nbsp; Rode my bike home in the pouring rain!&nbsp; That was interesting!&nbsp; Actually it was pretty fun, altho light blue isnt too far off from white...

       Let's see...where to begin?&nbsp; Maggie picked up about 5 45 and we went back to her house and had fun attempting to pick out her outfit for dinner [[we were planning to go somewhere kinda fancy]]&nbsp; then Alyson and Jen came over, and quickly left on a search for their wallets! Then brad came over and we waited around and hung out til everyone else came.&nbsp; Then we [alyson, jen, lee, brad, maggie, danny, and kenzie] went in search of a restaurant- no on olive garden due to the long wait [[if only we knew how crazy it would be everywhere else]] We ended up going over to crabtree and putting down reservations at the cheesecake factory for dessert while actually eating @ this cute little italian place downstairs.&nbsp; Stuffed ourselves there [lee and brad and cologne...] then went shopping/hanging out in the cool store with the massaging chairs--i want one! Bought a tank top @ AE b4 everything started to close.&nbsp; Then we hung around and waited for our table while the guys played weird games like gas baseball and then they started this weird shooting thing! *lol* Maggie and I ran away in embarrassment! = D&nbsp; Ordered cheesecake, stuffed ourselves for the second time.&nbsp; Then headed back towards maggies.  Danny mooned lee, alyson, jen, and maggie and ended up having his hat fly off in Brad's convertible, so we turned around and got that! *haha* Hung out for a little @ maggies b4 everyone started to leave [it was about 1130 or so] Ended up being kenzie, danny, maggie, and me--good times right there! We painted dannys toenails..nah more like his FEET with polish! *lol* Then they left and maggie and i went up to bed *talked for a few hours* and then fell asleep. Woke up today pretty early and she drove me home b4 going to work.&nbsp; I'm so glad we're friends. So i wasn't supposed to work today..but they needed someone and sundays rock plus no one would be there today...so i went!  Kristine[love her!], Patrick [obnoxious, but not TOO bad], Robert [long story], Gillian [cool, but we dont hang out], jason [dumb], scott [cute, but dumb], and clint were working.&nbsp; It was pretty fun, somewhat boring @ parts cuz no one was there.&nbsp; When no one was there we all went to the diving well and hung out.&nbsp; We won't go thru the whole story, but i ended up in the water with my clothes on *thanks clint* ended up swimming in my shorts and sports bra.&nbsp; Dried off...then got pushed BACK in.&nbsp; Oh well--it was still really fun.&nbsp; The guys were going off the high dive with huge dolphin floaties and such-lol.&nbsp; Had to spend the rest of the day being wet tho.&nbsp; Played word games on the comp with some pple then around 6 05 Robert gave me a ride home.&nbsp; Ate dinner, chatted, and now i'm gonna watch a movie with the fam!

       Last night Brad picked me up and we went over to Jen's to hang out with her, Alyson, and Lee.&nbsp; It was hilarious @ Jen's.&nbsp; Lee was making [ot attempting to] a cake for his sister and he made this caramel icing which we proceeded to use the excess to make all caramel cookies--haha.&nbsp; We took awhile being very indecisive about what we were doing, but eventually headed downtown and got some gelado! YUMM! That was fun...minus those weird bugs.&nbsp; Drove around for awhile, again being decisive and playing games, then ended up back @ jen's hanging out on the trampoline talking.&nbsp; Maggie came over after work, alyson left, brad left, then lee drove me home! I was way too hyper to fall asleep really quick..but i eventually managed to...thankfully.  Today I worked from 945 to 3.&nbsp; Morning was okay 'cept grosjean was there...argh i hate when she's the supervisor.&nbsp; I hadta clean like crazy! Then Alli came in at 2 and we went on a food run while we got Blake to cashier [[who spent the morning flexing his pecs]] to wendy's and planet smoothie.&nbsp; Left work half and hour later and now I'm home!

As if watching sports on tons of tvs would ever NOT be fun + eating a veggie pizza...tasty! Made the way back to our house where we hung out for a bit.&nbsp; I called Sarah while Christine and Dan watched trashy shows on tv *hah* Is it a male or female? Then Dan left and we went to sell ads for yearbook! It was pretty fun, minus pants in the hot weather! Plus that one guy christine..TASTY! I'm guessing once i call them all back and everything we'll have sold 2 or 3 ads.&nbsp; Sounds pitiful but it's hard! *oh well* Christine left a little while and now i'm back home for the night...wait nvm! Going out in a little bit! Gotta go shower after that&nbsp;hot afternoon! &nbsp;  17 days til school.  &nbsp;

[[twig n berries]] Talked to Clint for a bit b4 his lessons then swam some laps until my stomach started to growl.&nbsp; Then Chris noticed me from the water and came out and talked for a while.&nbsp; He was on break and we just hung out and laughed @ blake [alli's bf] having to give a swim test to the campers.&nbsp; Then blake came out and talked and complained about work stuff *lol* Finally scott came over while switching in the rotations [stand to stand for lifeguards] and they were all talking about beating up patrick! I was like  GUYS ! Went to food lion with alli to get more 1s and quarters for the register [me in the speedo--haha] Back to Opt, changed, then started working @ 145.&nbsp; Somewhat good day @ work, but also pretty boring cuz we kept closing and since Blake was there Alli was always out! They are such a cute couple. Closed with Katie around 8 then went with my dad to office depot! NEW PLANNER! Okay okay, so i like to decorate, i swear im not TOO much of a dork!  Then this girl showed up at my house in the rain [all axe-murderer like]! *haha* Christine came over! Woohoo!

Then met up with Christine [[thank you for getting up so early just to see ME]] and we talked for a bit watching the swim team kids until Shawn *lifeguard and swim team coach* pushed me in and then we swam some laps and talked..or both @ the same time [[bobbing up and down down the lanes--haha] Clint took his lesson kids over to join us *lol* and that was all just very silly. Got changed for work then christine left around 11:55 right b4 i hadta work!  Worked with Mary in the morning [[she's nice...old]] and then with Josh @ 2.  Yesterday was fun cuz the shift supervisors rocked yesterday--alison (another one) and Kim.  Fun girls right there! Got off around 7 and went home, gave dad his late b-day present *it was monday* It was a bumper sticker that said "My kids only see me as an ATM." =D  Watched tv with Jill and then talked to brad until it was his bedtime! [I'm gonna go on strike so that he doesn't hafta work as much] Read some hardball, then went to sleep!

HUGE bowl of frosted flakes monday morning to kick off the party of sunshine,&nbsp; swimming, horse shoes and volleyball boys, late night walk on the ocean w/ pools and cliffs.

        Where did i leave off? Wednesday was another day of work.&nbsp; It was kinda hectic with lots of stuff going on and unfort. i rode my bike in since none of my closer co-employees that drive were working.&nbsp; Worked w/ Josh for most of the day.&nbsp; He's a pretty cool guy besides the fact that he smokes and isnt going to college like he should next&nbsp; year [[although he says he will eventually..]] He's one of the 3 guy cashiers, the other 2 being Tom [old] and blake who also lifeguards so hardly ever cashiers. Oh and then managers occasionally cashier.&nbsp; Left work around 7 15 and went home and ate my 2nd dinner.  Then Brad and Brittney came by and picked me up and we headed over to Caitlin's to hang out.&nbsp; I haven't seen britt since the middle of june and brad in like..a week? So yeah obviously being deprived. *lol* Matt and lee along with peter K. and two random guys from other schools came over to the pool w/ us and were being sketchy.&nbsp; BOO ON DRUGS! But yeah so we abandoned that and went to GOODBERRY'S! With the nerdy guy checking out caitlin and brittney and watching some guys skateboard + woohoo for the hotness of the convertible.&nbsp; Watched some real world...home by 12!  Yesterday i worked again but it was really fun! YAYNESSITY! I swam laps in the morning for about 30 or 40 minutes then worked until about 5 30 [[alli came in around 2 so we got to hang out and Robert was being semi talkative for once]] then Clint asked me to be his rescue dummy in his lifeguarding class so i did that for 2 hours! *haha* It takes a lot of energy to drown! But yeah it was really fun minus the fact that towards the end it was freezing getting strapped onto the board + i have a massive amount of hair that velcro REALLY likes! However...*supposedly* clint will take me out to a dinner and movie for it! *haha* He was like..just pick a movie and we'll go when you get back.&nbsp; I doubt it'll happen i just think it's silly.&nbsp; Clint's a great guy tho, just fun to be around [[alli made sure to remind me that he's 19 and yes..thats fine, its not like that w/ us]]  Then CHRISTEENY came over! And helped me pack! And we hung out [+ HUGGED! haha good times] Went to bed after talking to McCall for a bit--i was EXHAUSTED.&nbsp; Woke up this morning and hand some extra time before i leave for the BEACH!!!!

       I haven't remembered any dreams for awhile--if i do they're usually nightmares.  Last night's was quite strange, winter formal @ the pool and my date was Scott [a lifeguard @ opt] it was just..strange, and he was obnoxious and i dont know.  I woke up half way thru, fell asleep, and actually continued the dream which never happens to me.  So uhm yesterday? Yeah i worked all day. *haha* 12 to 8 30.  It was pretty fun tho, i was supposed to get off @ 7 but tiffany really needed help closing so i stayed with her and helped her do that --good thing too cuz she really messed up. Tiffany's nice tho, just not someone I'd be really close to.  Won't go there right now. Ran in the rain to talk to clint cuz he said he'd pick me up today but thatd be too late cuz i start @ 12 and he's done w/ lessons @ 12 30.  Then said bye to Robert--the only one left cuz we closed early and ran in the rain to the car! I was soaked by the time i got in the house! Haha my pink polo was pretty much red. Listened to Nirvana and Grandaddy to uhm..almost wind down last night *haha* Then bed and now its TUESDAY and working again! Which is fine cuz I hafta take those 5 days off.  Ahh i love summer!

       Sunday through me out of the loop because i hadta get up @ like 6 in order to be @ work @ 645.  [good thing im not jill or i woulda taken about 2 hours to get ready] I worked until 1...if you can call that work.  After 9:30 we close down and clean and all i hadta do was clean the lobby so i hung out with everyone else or read The House of the Spirits--finished.  Left around one when Josh came and took over.  What did i do when i came home?  Yeah i def. fell right asleep for 3 hours! I was still pretty exhausted from saturday + sore. Then i woke up and...*tries to remember last night* I dont know, had yummy spaghetti, watched more track + field and swimming and played Jill's new CDs--which i needta remember to burn b4 she goes to Boston.  Well ive got a while since she doesnt start school until SEPTEMBER 7th!! Not fair...  TONY's COMING HOME AUGUST 10th--my first official day of school.  This should be interesting...

       ^ album by Grandaddy [this is my second time trying to post this...]  Thursday i worked from 12 til 5 [work has become a lot more fun, i'm more confident, and im meeting and getting to know everyone else better].  After work i went over to Emily's for her birthday party! *YAY* We watched Sixteen Candles [yes john cusack does have a FEW lines], ate pizza, cake, opened presents, and watched CLUELESS! The caps and exclamation mark are def. needed there.  It was really fun! Even if i was a reject due to my non-explorisness.    Friday i worked again..this time from 9 15 to 2 15.  I love those extra 30 minutes.  It was really fun...clint and scott were hilarious and tiffany had candy =D  Clint gave me a ride home and i took a wee nap and talked on the fone to brad [lucky bastard's at the beach ] and danielle before going out to eat with my parental units.  Yummy veggie pizza @ CAH.  Then i headed over to...*drum roll* CHRISTINE'S HOUSE! Who woulda guessed it..?  Today we had a BLAST! Headed out to falls lake and hung out on the boat/in the water/on the tube all day!  It was really fun! Some of the waves were HUGE! And bikinis are great for fast speeds...Yummy food too [ew on fluff, peanut butter, and jelly!] Mmm..strawberries!  Got a little bit PINK, oh well! Hadta have fun on my day off! Plans for tonight?  Watching olympic trials, music, and SLEEP!

       Tuesday night peanut definitely had two seizures.  It was incredibly scary, he literally fell down the 16 stairs leading from our deck to the ground.  We think it was from heatstroke but the vet said his body temp wasnt THAT high...i dont know, but i was freaking out but having to stay calm since my mom was like SCREAMING! Everything seems okay today tho.  After that whole ordeal Christine came over, ate salads and such, haha attempted to make jill's sandwich, and then went to the notebook FINALLY! It was really good, reminded me of a lot of stuff, and to all guys--GO SEE IT! Girls won't question your manhood...that much!  Zab and Amanda *manager and guard from millbrook* were there too..saw me and waved.  Woohoo for movies and icecream!  I love that goodberry's is right there.  Hurray for mint w/ oreo.  Too bad chris hadta leave cuz of cilting the next day.  So yesterday i spent most of the day at millbrook swimming/sunning.  I was just in a 'pool mood.'  It was fine...hung out with jill some, allie, and trevor.  Got a bit of color..*smiley* but i still wore my sunblock! Got picked up, went to the mall, then had an inservice for cashiers @ opt.  Really fun actually--haha it was actually a blast!  I was sooo hyper.  Today i'm working from 12-5.  Then off to Emily's!

       Two days of work and now i get tomorrow off! *yay*  I worked from 2 to 9 yesterday which was pretty fun cuz a lot of good pple were working.  Like Allie, Scott, Robert...  After work i hung out with Christine and Dan for about an hour! I hadnt seen Chris in FOREVER! Then today i was supposed to be off but trevor *head guard/manager from Millbrook* called and wanted me to come in and work there from 9 to 2 cuz their person didnt show up.  So i worked there..it was fine.  Millbrook is a lot quieter then Optimist and w/ a lot less people working.  Most of the people working there are really nice too, but i dont talk to them too much.  However Trevor came and hung out by the front desk with me some.  He's a cool guy...hopefully ill get to see him a few more times this summer.  He gave me a ride home and TA DA!  Here i am!

I hadn't seen that boy in forever! *geez* Worked from 1 til 6:30 until the pool closed because of the bad weather.  I was so glad that Robert [[shifter]] let me leave! THANK YOU ROBERT! Although work was fun...haha carla asked me where i was going to COLLEGE! haha! then..how many years do you have left? 1? HAHAH! MORE LIKE THREE! Clint was busy robbing my cradle again--"all my dreams came true when i first felt the touch of your fingers against mine." Some weird dude was stalking Krystene..haha!  Lee and Jen picked me up and we headed over to Hickville! AKA Garner! Went to brad's, had dinner, met up with everyone [[rachel, lauren, danny, kenzie, brad, lee, caitlin, jen, alyson, oj, jessica, erin, danielle and peter k. and david b. later]] Went over and watched the fireworks! haha with the car alarm and symphony playing + ash falling! Went-a-boy-huntin' w/ caitlin, lauren, and rach..haha that was funny now! Playing ten fingers...serious stuff has happened in my bed! Chilled @ brad's afterwards w/ everyone.  Tons of stuff happened but it ended up like this:  Kenzie, danielle, and i sleeping in brads room, Lee in brad's brothers room, danny on the floor w/ brad and oj on the couches in the living room! It was a blast but boy am i tired today! Danielle and Kenzie--thanks for a great time! The priests knees..good times right there! So then this morning got up, ate breakfast, and then went to get danielles car cuz she left it the night b4 due to no after 9.  Well it was locked in, we hadta call the police, took more than an hour to get it unlocked, then got lost on the way home, but made it to millbrook just in time!  I worked @ millbrook today cuz they didnt have a cashier scheduled! woot woot? *haha* Always fun meeting new pple! And now im home and i think we're gonna eat then go see the fireworks tonight! *family time* WOOHOO!!

       No entry yesterday due to the fact that i spend 7.5 hours of my day making money and a large number of the other hours catching up on some sleep.  Work was good.  The ride was hot, but hey at least i got some exercise.  I found this lady's gold mom bracelet for her in the lost and found and she got soo excited on the fone and then when she came to pick it up she brought this HUGE can of salted peanuts and gave them to me! *haha* Which reminded me of eating jana's peanuts in geometry class last year--good times right there! But yeah, so me and pat opened the can w/ a screw driver cuz we dont have a can opener @ work.  *hah* Then everyone ate em [[myself included--i ate WAY too many]] and then they were all gone! But hey..it was a nice thank you even though i didnt exactly do much!  Closed out by myself after saying goodbye to my buddy who was there again for lifeguarding.  Got home around 9.  Bed around 12 after finishing The Rescue by Nicholas Sparks.  Plans for today?  We shall see...

       You go on ahead, Honey You have a good time there You make me feel funny I'm no ordinary lover or a friend  I believe we have things to do I believe in myself and I believe in you I believe when I sleep you are near to me When you sleep, I am near to you  You walk out of the room with your hands so deep In your pockets I don't recognize you You say you're a ghost in our house and I realize I do think I see through you  So you go on ahead, Honey You have a good time there You make me feel funny I'm no ordinary lover or a friend  It's a death in our love that has brought us here It's a birth that has changed our lives It's a place that I hope we'll be leaving soon And I fear for the year in his eyes  And it goes 'round in circles One night is lovely The next is brutal And you and me are in way over our heads with this one, it's hard To admit it  So you hold me and I can't feel you We hurt but we smile I promise I'll make it back When the summer has warmed me awhile  You go on ahead, Honey You have a good time there You make me feel funny I'm no ordinary lover or a friend  I believe we have things to do I believe in myself and I believe in you I believe when I sleep, you are near to me When you sleep, I am near to you

       Another day of volleyball tryouts.  Not quite as fun as the first [[reminds me of how the first day of school is so fun cuz u see everyone then the second and third it just begins to fade.]] However, as i can tell by my soreness, i am getting back in shape. I need to work on hitting since i play front row..altho i dno what it will be like this time.  What if i dont play? ARGH...dont wanna start thinking about that right now.  So now that ive watched the freshies id say 3 of them are good and will get some playing time.  Depending on how many she cuts, i dno who else will be picked.  All i know is that i want to play middle hitter and that i have some competition for the spot.  oh well, itll make me push myself.  After tryouts brad came down to the gym and we talked for a little while then i left with maggie, jen, and a new tennis freshie, allison.  *or maybe she spells it my way, thatd make her awesome* Who needs two Ls in Alison?

       Jen drove me to volleyball yesterday, went up to peace and said hey to jana and some of the new freshies, then down to halifax for practice.  It was great seeing some of my team mates again, like lauren, nikki, emily, erin, etc.  There were a TON of freshman.  7 of them and 2 more are coming.  So we're def. gonna hafta make cuts this year, unlike last year.  Most of them are just now starting volleyball, but i mean tahts fine, i practically did the same thing.  Overal theyre pretty shy, but one girl is like really cocky and i dno why but w/e.  It just felt great not to be the youngest one.  Actually, it felt wonderful *lol* but i'm gonna try to make them feel welcome...i know they must be nervous w/ so many of them trying out.  Tennis got rained out so a few of them came down and watched volleyball for a while [i love my tennis girls!] then matt, andrew, and jeff came by.  We hung out for a while and then went to bojangle's before heading back to halifax for the boys' soccer tryouts.  Everyone started to show up for that [[met 2 new kids]] Hung out til the guys hadta go play then dropped of maggie and me and jen went back to her house, showered, and hung out til maggie came back and we had our girl party --that was a great pillow fight maggie! Maggie drove me home later than night and now its tuesday, another day closer to when school starts, and another day of volleyball.

       Only have a week till school starts.  It's crazy.  However, the last few days have been so much fun. I went to the mall w/ jana and laney yesterday.  Free panties @ VS, make up counters in belk, and jana trying on huge heels in attempt to be taller than me [good times right THERE!] It was really fun, i hadnt seen laney in a while so that was good too! I got a few things + achieved my goal in getting jana to try stuff on thank [[thank you i love you!]] Then she got picked up and brad and caitlin drove up right as she was leaving.  We chilled in my room for a bit and then lee came over.  How many outfits did me and caitlin go through>? Then we went over to maggies so i could give her back her pants for her portraits today + we kidnapped her! *lol*  Drove over to A3s, played some video games [mortal kombat brings back SO many memories!] then headed over to Chili's for dinner.  Brad hadta leave : ( b4 we ordered but then Jen met up with us. Ate dinner then actually went to go play tennish, yes, i said play tennis.  A3 left and we went over to jen's neighborhood.  Changed clothes, and played for about an hour.  It was fun...def. a good laugh.  Then everyone needed to get home so me and lee dropped off caitlin around 1135 then drove me home.  We talked for awhile [that was more then ive let out in a long time] then i went in to bed! i was  exhausted . Plans for today...VOLLEYBALL..oh gawd.
