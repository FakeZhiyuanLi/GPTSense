      Ok, I'm gonna write this one in english, just in case a fellow American comes here.  I have seen the last movie of Michael Moore yesterday but before commenting directly on that I would like to talk about a converstation I had Saturday night with some American friends. In Seattle, most people I know and see are "liberals" and so they definitely want to get rid of Bush in November election. Hence, they were telling me things like "I don't know if I am gonna see this movie, I know already that Bush is a complete asshole etc...". I imagine they don't want to hear again about some of the stories the film talks about, like the 2000 election and Bush's "coup". And they said they don't think this movie was going to change anything on the way people are going to vote in November.  Then, I came to see that movie the day after (yesterday), and I must say I don't think they were right about the movie. I think it can definitely change the way one sees Bush, and the American political system as a whole, also. I was really hurt by that movie, and I am not a particularly sensible person. I already knew of many facts the movie talks about (like the Carlyle group or BinLaden's and Bush's families relationships). I had seen, when I was still in France, a documentary on that, which was more documented and precise than Moore's movie but much colder and far less moving. But Farenheit 9/11 is not only about facts, even if it states the most brutal ones, it is about men in war, men that decide of wars, and men that actually do war, basically the young and poor unemployed people of the United-States.  It reminds me of this Bob Dylan song ( urlLink Masters of War ), which seems to be fairly naive when you listen to the lyrics. Go and see Moore's movie, and you will find those lyrics are far from naive ...  Finally, before seeing that movie, I did not understand why it has won the "Palme d'Or" at last Cannes Festival, now that I've seen it, I definitely understand the decision of the jury. When a film can move you as this one has moved me, it deserves that kind of prizes and that many many people go and see it.

      Dans une dépêche sur  urlLink LinuxFR , on  urlLink parle  de ce logiciel qui permet de découvrir de la musique en ligne, libre de droit, donc parfaitement légale. Il y a un système de notation qui permet au logiciel de s'adapter au goûts de l'utilisateur et de proposer de découvrir de novueaux artistes. J'ai pas encore testé mais ça m'a l'air prometteur :   urlLink iRATE radio home - free and legal music

      Vu sur  urlLink Totalement crétins  : un test de personalité qui, pour moi, donne un résultat m'a foi assez vrai :   urlLink Jenny Turpish Slapped Me: Quizzes - Better Personality      You are an SECF--Sober Emotional Constructive Follower. This makes you a hippie. You are passionate about your causes and steadfast in your commitments. Once you've made up your mind, no one can convince you otherwise. Your politics are left-leaning, and your lifestyle choices decidedly temperate and chaste.  You do tremendous work when focused, but usually you operate somewhat distracted. You blow hot and cold, and while you normally endeavor on the side of goodness and truth, you have a massive mean streak which is not to be taken lightly. You don't get mad, you get even.  Please don't get even with this web site.
